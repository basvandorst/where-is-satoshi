TECHNOLOGY ought to have revolutionised finance more than any other industry. After all, modern money is mostly an entry on a computer—capable of being transmitted instantly and virtually costlessly around the world. Stockmarket activity is now dominated by high-frequency traders, who make deals faster than they can blink.
The finance sector spends more on technology, as a proportion of its revenues, than any other industry. Nevertheless, compared with the world of e-commerce, banking still sometimes gives the impression of a Volkswagen Beetle instead of a Formula 1 racing car. It took many years of effort to get to a world of “T+2”, where securities are settled two days after the trade is made, rather than the “T+3” system that preceded it.
The international payments system still looks like a “spaghetti junction”, in the words of Andrew Haldane, the Bank of England’s chief economist, with money passing through several hands on the way from payer to recipient. The annual revenues earned by the banking system for processing payments are huge, at $1.7 trillion, and rising (see chart).
One reason for this inefficiency is that technology has been tacked on to a centuries-old banking model. Much bank spending on technology is devoted to maintaining existing systems, a desperate effort to keep the show on the road.
Hence the hype around “fintech”—the hope that the whole system can be overhauled by disruptive innovators, much as Uber is revolutionising the taxi business and Airbnb is taking on hotels. Fintech firms operate in many areas, from digital payments to automated wealth management. But at a London Business School conference this week, the greatest excitement was reserved for blockchain technology. A blockchain is a “distributed ledger” under which transaction records are held by a wide number of participants in a network; it is the technology behind Bitcoin, a digital currency.
Technology experts seem to think a distributed ledger is more secure. A hacker would be required to break into a wide range of sites rather than a single, central register. But there are doubts over whether such a system could handle the sheer volume of payments in the financial system—hundreds of thousands of transactions every second.
Even if those technological hurdles could be overcome, a register could develop in two different ways. An open system would be good for customers, allowing them to exchange money quickly, cheaply and anonymously. But it would be a nightmare for regulators trying to crack down on tax evasion and money-laundering. No longer would the unscrupulous need to keep high-value notes under the mattress. A supervised system would get round this problem, but it would also give the authorities much more power to pry into people’s financial lives. Customers would understandably be far less keen.
A largely unregulated technology sector is bumping up against a heavily regulated finance industry. The result may be that advances in this area will be slow as regulators clamp down on anything that seems too anarchic. The big banks, conscious of the ability of regulators to fine them for aiding and abetting money-laundering, will proceed with caution.
Susan Athey, an economist with links to Silicon Valley, argues that blockchain technology might be most useful for other purposes—to register asset ownership, for example. People in developing countries find it difficult to establish their ownership of land; a reliable digital register could reduce that problem. And a digital land registry in America would eliminate the need for homeowners to pay for expensive title insurance.
Forecasting how new technology will change an industry is never easy. As Bill Gates once said, and tech types constantly repeat: “We always overestimate the change that will occur in the next two years and underestimate the change that will occur in the next ten.”
But monetary policy may be giving new financial models a lift. Very low interest rates encourage investors to search for yield. One beneficiary is peer-to-peer lending, in which investors extend credit to people and businesses directly. And imagine what would happen if negative interest rates became semi-permanent and were passed on to retail depositors—a tax on bank accounts. The appeal of digital currencies that were out of the reach of central bankers would increase exponentially. Never mind disrupting commercial banks. What about doing the same thing to central banks?

No, it wouldn't show P=NP. To solve that equation, you only have to consider a finite number of inputs because of the fixed length-output. That won't help you in solving decision problems with arbitrary size inputs. It is reasonable to expect that SHA256 will be broken at some point given enough time and effort (using differential cryptanalysis, like breaking MD5). It is unreasonable to expect proving P=NP just by time and effort. Most people in the field agree that we don't even know where to start. Also, they of course believe the negation is true.

My point was that they can not be "cleaned away with regulation". What would you disallow, the act of borrowing or the act of selling? As soon as these acts are allowed, shorts are allowed, because fundamentally that's what they are. You seem to think that a short is somehow more than that. Bitfinex packages the two acts into one, but that is just for convenience. You can disallow the shorting functionality on exchanges and thus make shorts less convenient. But by that you haven't disallowed shorts. People will continue to sell borrowed bitcoins.

I never understood this "unproductive wealth" argument. I think it is false. You're not removing actual means of production from the economy. You're just removing arbitrary tokens which are used to measure the value of those means of production. As soon as you remove them (making them "unproductive") the value of the remaining tokens increases. So for such tokens, the distinction between productive and unproductive doesn't really apply, in some sense they're always productive.

This. The term "trusted" is usually used incorrectly in the sense of "trust-requiring". I think the right approach is to fight that usage and refuse to call those protocols "trusted". They aren't.

I don't think you can "disagree with shorts" any more than you can disagree with, say, gravity. A short consists of two steps: 1) borrowing bitcoins and 2) selling bitcoins. Both are completely voluntary actions in agreement between two market participants, the first between a borrower and a lender, and the second between a seller and a buyer. If you want to disallow shorts, you have to disallow one of those two actions. Which you probably don't want to.

By BRADLEY HOPE And  MICHAEL J. CASEY
May 10, 2015 6:28 p.m. ET
Nasdaq OMX Group Inc. is testing a new use of the technology that underpins the digital currency bitcoin, in a bid to transform the trading of shares in private companies.
The experiment joins a slew of financial-industry forays into bitcoin-related technology. If the effort is deemed successful, Nasdaq wants to use so-called blockchain technology in its stock market, one of the world’s largest, and potentially shake up systems that have facilitated the trading of financial assets for decades.
“Utilizing the blockchain is a natural digital evolution for managing physical securities,” said Nasdaq Chief Executive Robert Greifeld. He said the technology holds the potential to “benefit not only our clients, but the broader global capital markets.”
Nasdaq will start its pilot project in Nasdaq Private Market, a fledgling marketplace launched in January 2014 to handle pre-IPO trading among private companies. The platform has more than 75 private companies signed up, according to the company.
Private companies typically handle sales and transfers of shares with largely informal systems, including spreadsheets maintained by lawyers who verify transactions by hand. Nasdaq wants to replace that process with a system based on bitcoin’s blockchain technology.
The blockchain ledger is seen by some in the financial industry as the most compelling aspect of bitcoin because it can be used beyond merely buying and selling goods or services with a new currency.
The blockchain is maintained, updated and verified by a vast global network of independently owned computers known as “miners” that collectively work to prove the ledger’s authenticity.
In theory, this decentralized system for verifying information means transactions need no longer be channeled through banks, clearinghouses and other middlemen. Advocates say this “trustless” structure means direct transfers of ownership can occur over the blockchain almost instantaneously without the risk of default or manipulation by an intermediating third party.
One idea is that encrypted, digital representations of share certificates could be inserted into minute bitcoin transactions known as “Satoshis,” facilitating an immediate, verifiable transfer of stock ownership from seller to buyer.
Still, bitcoin-based settlement remains untested in the real world. Regulators worry about the anonymous status of the bitcoin miners that collectively manage the system. It is conceivable that bad actors might one day take over the mining network and destroy the integrity of its verification system, some say.
Also, bitcoin’s underlying software is unable to handle the massive increase in data storage that a Wall Street settlement system would require. While the software could simply be updated, implementation will require consensus among the many, far-flung miners.
Nasdaq Private Market is also a relatively small project for Nasdaq so any changes there aren’t far-reaching. At the same time, the experiment is the latest example of large financial firms exploring the use of the technology.
In recent months, the New York Stock Exchange unit of Intercontinental Exchange Inc. announced an investment in the bitcoin-trading platform Coinbase; Goldman Sachs Group Inc. invested in bitcoin consumer- services company Circle Internet Financial; and big trading firm DRW Holdings LLC said a subsidiary had “begun to experiment with cryptocurrency trading.”
Meanwhile, Digital Asset Holdings, led by former J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. executive Blythe Masters, is, like Nasdaq, developing a blockchain-based system for settling transfers of securities and funds.
Some see the blockchain as a way to attain a long-held securities-industry goal of real-time settlement, shifting the current “T+3” structure, in which the final transfer of funds and securities occurs three days after each trade, to “T+0.”
Real-time settlement has been a goal of regulators and investors alike as it would reduce the risk of counterparty failure and free up billions of dollars of capital that is sidelined during that wait period.
Oliver Bussmann, chief investment officer of Swiss bank UBS AG, last year said the blockchain was the biggest disrupting force in the financial sector, meaning its success could potentially have far-reaching ramifications for banks, trading houses and others. His bank has since established a special blockchain lab to study uses of the technology.
Nasdaq named Fredrik Voss, a vice president, as its new “blockchain technology evangelist” to lead efforts to increase use of the technology.

lots of comments suggest that this does not improve on using x.509 certificates. the reason x.509 certificates are rarely used for client authentication is that they are inconvenient to set up and hard to keep safe (as in both safe from loss and from compromise). with a bitcoin wallet, all of that is usually already taken care of. maybe it's not worth getting a bitcoin wallet just for web authentication. but as a bitcoin user, using a password to log into, say, bitstamp, simply feels anachronistic.

I'm not sure whether that's a reason deflationary money is environmentally friendly. For one, the spending/saving dichotomy is not so clear. Saving is deferred spending. Even if you don't spend your money, at some point your inheritors will. Second, inflationary money does not encourage spending in the sense of "consuming", just in the sense of "not holding money". It could be invested, e.g. in stocks or bonds.
I think you're right though, deflationary money is environmentally friendly, but for another reason: without deflationary money people use natural ressources as store of value. This leads to higher and more volatile demand for those ressources. There's a recent article by Nick Szabo about it, very worthwhile:

Bitcoin was designed for the bitcoin users and holders. A miner is not necessarily also a bitcoin holder. If not, then the miner interests and user interests are not aligned. In fact, they are diametrically opposed. The income of the miner, both fee and block reward, is payed by the users and holders. So the miner wants them to increase, while the user wants them to decrease.

Blockchain use at companies remains in the experimental stage, but chief information officers that want to understand the digital ledger’s enterprise potential should create a team and start downloading basic tools now, say IT leaders exploring the technology.
The appeal of blockchain is that it’s an online, ongoing ledger of transactions – any transactions, not just financial. Tight security comes from encrypting data in each block, as well as requiring all the other computers, or nodes, on a given blockchain to verify transactions. “This market is at the concept stage,” said Jeremy Millar, a partner with Magister Advisors, an M&amp;A advisory firm. “These are long-run plays. But a really important long-run play.”
Financial services firms have jumped in, building pilot systems to process banking, trading and other asset transactions. CIOs in all industries should be investigating blockchain because of its potential to increase efficiency in conducting transactions with outside parties and speed up how quickly transactions are completed, said Chris Perretta, global head of enterprise data and technology at State Street Corp.
State Street is starting to experiment with blockchain in three ways: internally as part of core software development; with clients in private trials; and as part of a handful of consortia of the world’s biggest banks and technology companies. “No one doubts the usefulness of blockchain because it’s working now in the Bitcoin world,” Mr. Perretta said, referring to the virtual currency that is based on blockchain technology. “It’s not like the technology has to become; it’s there.”
The first step is to assess your organization’s tolerance for risk, Mr. Millar said. If the appetite isn’t there for trying something unproven on the enterprise scale and lacking in standards, gather intelligence rather than build pilots, he said. Watch how experiments go in the financial world and be ready to answer questions when senior-level peers start asking, he said.
If you’re ready to delve in, first download open-source tools from bitcoin.org and GitHub, including core blockchain code and development tools for setting up nodes and performing operational tasks like interacting with blocks. Coders can use a variety of languages. Some are familiar, like C and JavaScript, said Hu Liang, senior managing director, head of the emerging technologies center at State Street. Others are new, such as Serpent, from the non-profit Ethereum Frontier, which offers a blockchain development platform
Other key steps CIOs can take to delve into blockchain include the following:
When deciding what kind of application to pilot, find a relatively simple transaction your company frequently performs, and try to recreate it with (?) blockchain tools from different vendors, Mr. Millar said. That will show any differences in how technology companies handle blockchain, he said.
Bring in several vendors, both startups and established players such as Microsoft Corp. and International Business Machines Corp., to build test applications, Mr. Millar advised. Without industry standards, each vendor has its own approach to blockchain. Bring in several companies for discussions and pilots to learn about their biases, he said.
One of blockchain’s strengths is efficiency. After you are familiar with how blockchain works, look for a new scenario to try. Identify a business process that requires many hand-offs to complete, such as a complicated purchase order or financial transaction. Try to build a blockchain to perform that process, to see whether it can be made faster or smoother, Mr. Perretta said. State Street is prototyping a loan application, Mr. Liang said. His team is ready to demonstrate the application internally, he said. “We’re not saying we’re going to save $300 million. It’s a proof of technology concepts,” he said.

In case bitcoin crept into your consciousness during a quiet first week of the year, because the price of the so-called cryptocurrency has passed a notable round number in dollars — $1,000 — most questions about the technological curiosity can be answered with another easy to remember figure: zero.
For instance, the Bank for International Settlements estimates the amount traded daily for the world’s 180 or so recognised currencies. Last year this ranged from $4.4tn in dollars, down to $1bn for the 37th most actively traded, the Bulgarian lev. In this context, the sum of bitcoin transactions rounds to zero.
Another measure might be the collective value of bitcoins, which stood at $16bn on Tuesday according to Bitcoin Info. Currencies aren’t normally discussed in terms of their overall worth, as they are supposed to be mediums of exchange rather than some absolute store of value. Still, for context, the Central Intelligence Agency put the planet’s stock of broad money — notes, coins, and various forms of bank account — at $82tn as of the end of 2014.
On the CIA figures, the value of bitcoins hashed into existence is similar to the broad money total for Uzbekistani soms. With apologies to Tashkent, the value of soms and bitcoins, and the number of people for whom they are relevant pieces of information in the world of modern finance, both round to zero.
Treat bitcoins as an investment and even if they could all be sold today for $1,000 apiece, they would only be worth as much as the Cerner Corporation, a US company of moderate size and limited profile involved in the management of digital healthcare records.
Except treating bitcoin as an investment means it can’t be a currency, and vice versa. The problem is that a medium of exchange prone to collapsing or quadrupling in price is useless as a practical currency, whatever the cryptographic elegance of its creation.
As a phenomenon bitcoin has all the attributes of a pyramid scheme, requiring a constant influx of converts to push up the price, based on the promise of its use by future converts. So the ultimate value for bitcoin will be the same as all pyramid schemes: zero.

The virtual currency bitcoin celebrated the new year by rising through the $1,000 mark.
On Sunday, when most traders around the world were enjoying a day of rest, the digital currency, which trades on weekdays and weekends, crossed the line just before 4 p.m. New York time.
Tuesday, as capital markets reopened, bitcoin rose a bit more to about $1,022, according to CoinDesk. That built on a gain of about 123% in 2016 that lapped most stocks, bonds and commodities.
A digital currency maintained by a decentralized network of computers, bitcoin has been surging behind an increase in geopolitical uncertainty and budding fears about inflation.
The currency had faded from the public eye through early 2016 as prices stalled and traders battled about the structure of the approximately eight-year old market.
Now, with trading volumes rising sharply and some countries such as India making large cash payments more difficult, higher demand has pushed the bitcoin price up. Supply constraints forced by bitcoin’s algorithm of gradually slowing creation of new coins also played a role.
Professional funds and traders have responded by building up their presence trading bitcoin. That can support the price and reduce volatility. Cumberland Mining, a unit of market-making giant DRW Holdings LLC that focuses on bitcoin, had just started a pilot in 2013, as bitcoin spiked to its high above $1,100 before crashing back to $200.
Now, says Cumberland trader Bobby Cho, the firm is fully up and running and has counterparties in 20 countries. “In this market, more decentralized and fragmented is great,” he said
Retail ownership is similarly widening out. For example, Coinbase Inc., which trades and holds bitcoins for individuals, started in 2013 with just 13,000 digital wallets. As of late this year, it had 11 million. At least two U.S. exchange-traded funds could launch this year if they receive Securities and Exchange Commission approval.
The currency still has plenty of challenges in front of it. While bitcoin traders were embroiled by arcane topics of how quickly the coins can be bought and sold, others were taking the technology it is based on—an open ledger system known as blockchain—and trying to apply it to other uses. Myriad consortiums and startups have been building new platforms for financial services, for instance, utilizing the underlying technology.
More importantly for many investors, Bitcoin has yet to enjoy a prolonged stretch where its reputation hasn’t been affected by hackings or other problems on platforms that sponsor the trading and sales of the currency.

You're thinking of plain vanilla payment channels. The lightning network is routed, meaning that if you have a channel to a node, you can not only pay that node, but all nodes that this node has channels to, and the nodes that those nodes have channels to, and so on. With mild connectivity assumptions this means you can pay everybody on the network with your "locked" funds. So the word "locked" does not really describe the situation well.
@_date: 2017-08-18 17:10:25
The length of the chain only matters when you compare two chains that follow the same consensus rules. Segwit2X does not follow the current consensus rules. The economic majority will decide which of the two incompatible chains will have more value. What you consider the most likely outcome is in fact highly uncertain.
@_date: 2017-08-25 14:17:49
People are storing arbitrary data in the blockchain, not just payments. Look at eternity wall and such. It's essentially impossible to identify and stop "non-payment" transactions. Fees are needed to limit this to a rate that is in a reasonable relation to the cost of all nodes storing this data forever.

Hashrate only determines the winning chain between two chains following the same consensus rules. Not between two chains following incompatible consensus rules (like Segwit2X). Two incompatible chains result in two separate coins, separately tradeable. Their relative success will be determined by the market. The market sets the price of both coins and thus the mining profitability and thus the hashrate.

I'm referring to your original comment ("need to lock up funds with the one party you want to do microtransactions with") that led me to believe that you were thinking of traditional payment channels instead of LN.

@_date: 2017-08-18 22:30:29
Nodes follow the longest chain of *valid* blocks. Consensus rules determine what blocks are considered valid: reward schedule, signature validation, input sum greater than output sum etc. -- including the blocksize limit. Segwit2X deviates from these rules, so if a chain based on it came into existence, clearly that would be the altcoin.

Goldman Sachs Group Inc. has dropped out of the R3 CEV LLC blockchain group. The investment bank was one of nine original members of R3, founded in 2014 to explore the use of the distributed database technology in Wall Street infrastructure.
The technology, best known for underpinning the system that trades the virtual currency bitcoin, has garnered increasing attention as a way banks can save billions of dollars and make old-fashioned processes faster and more efficient.
But not all blockchain firms are the same, with different banks backing different ventures to exploit the technology. As of Oct. 31, Goldman let its membership lapse in R3, one of the higher profile efforts, but the firm will continue to work with blockchain technology, a spokeswoman for the investment bank said.
The online distributed ledger is best known for supporting bitcoin digital currency, but banks want to use it to speed up transactions, cut operations costs and better secure the banking and other infrastructure. Blockchain is said to provide an immutable record of transactions and identities. This could eliminate middlemen that perform these services in the existing financial infrastructure.
Turnover is expected, an R3 spokesman said. “Developing technology like this requires dedication and significant resources, and our diverse pool of members all have different capacities and capabilities which naturally change over time,” he said in an email.
As R3 builds blockchain pilots, the group is also seeking equity investment from members in exchange for a stake in proceeds from future technology and products, according to a person familiar with the matter. R3’s 70 members include Bank of America Corp., J.P. Morgan Chase and State Street Corp.
In April, R3 revealed a key early product called Corda, which is a distributed ledger to manage financial contracts. The group has also run a series of blockchain pilots with subsets of its membership, including one where 11 banks traded electronic tokens of value among offices in North America, Europe and Asia to simulate financial transactions over a five-day period. In November, 10 members of R3 tested a Know-Your-Customer system that allows a blockchain ledger to manage and verify parties’ identities.
Goldman has committed to blockchain through investing and through internal development. The bank in 2015 was one of two lead investors in a $50 million funding round for bitcoin startup Circle Internet Financial Ltd. Goldman is also seeking patents on two blockchain-related inventions, for foreign exchange trading and digital currency.
Blockchain has not yet been deployed widely for commercial use, in part because the legalities are unclear. Regulators have not made statements about the requirements blockchain-based systems must meet. Nasdaq Inc.’s Linq exchange for trading shares in private companies is one of the only blockchain-based financial systems in use.

Speaking of central bank independence, would you say that's a good thing for the average citizen? As I understand, the Fed is essentially run by a cartel of banks who get the profits from seignorage.

Here's something I don't understand. The crucial ingredient in Bitcoin is to use proof-of-work to run the system on unauthenticated nodes. I don't think any IBM customer needs that feature. And all ingredients for running such a system on authenticated nodes have been around for more than twenty years (essentially public key cryptography). So, why is now all the sudden a good time to build these systems? That we could have built a long time ago, but never did?

No, the size of the private keyspace is 2^256. A brute force of at maybe 2^60 is realistic, so for that you'd need to know around 75% of the key. But since you probably know the public key there are better ways to attack the private key than brute force search. Not sure how they work though.

I never claimed it was.




Excuse me, how is that not exactly what I said?




I never said anyone should trust someone else's node. You should trust your own node. But "cannot do anything but lie"... is that your level of discourse?  


The bitcoin client was never "programmed to insert" non-mining nodes. What a misleading thing to say! The CPU mining code was simply removed because CPU hashing power was effectively zero. Even before that you could run the client without mining. 




Yes. It protects you against someone withholding transactions from you, protects you against miner negligence (like in the p2sh soft-fork) and does  not leak the addresses/txs you query.

As I said, you have a narrower definition of "to invest" than me. Replace it by "to hold", which is closer to what I'm thinking of. 


So, bitcoin is not "meant to be" used for "investment"? And thus you can't expect it to perform satisfactorily if you use it for that? Is that what you're saying?


That would be publicly known. Bad publicity and illegal in many jurisdictions. But, yes, if more than half the hashpower colludes, we have a problem.     


You don't. It's a risk you're willing to take. I didn't say it was without risk. In fact, I said nothing about the on- and off-ramps. I said that a bitcoin transaction was more censorship resistant than a bank transfer.

Please don't use the word "private blockchain" as if such a thing existed. In a private network consensus is easily achieved without cumulative proof-of-work and thus without committing later proof-of-work to earlier proof-of-work and thus without a blockchain. The blockchain solves a problem that you do not have in a private network.

No, it really is what the protocol says. The protocol is defined by the software run by the nodes. The behaviour can't be enforced, if that's what you mean. (I didn't claim that.)




Again: the protocol is the software run by the nodes. It "explicitly says" no such thing. In any case, a judge thinking in terms of market access and price collusion probably wouldn't care.

Litecoin is very similar to bitcoin. The only differences are  the time between blocks and the hash function for proof-of-work. It's hard to think of a scenario that would cause bitcoin to collapse while not at the same time causing litecoin to collapse as well. It's conceivable that there will be a problem with the hash function at some point. But from what I've seen cryptographic hash functions don't just break out of the blue. People slowly get better at understanding how to attack them. There would probably be enough time to change the hash function.

What makes you say that? The double spend attacker wins if his chain contains more work than the honest chain. In a hypothetical network with one tenth the inter block time but otherwise the same, his chances of winning are the same.

For our discussion only the software run by miners is relevant. That's what I'm talking about. If you look at this software (mostly bitcoin core, presumably, but others too) it will mine on the longest known valid chain (for different notions of valid). I think you have a different notion of "protocol". A protocol is just the software run by a bunch of communicating nodes. 


Technically a non-mining node is just a mining node with hash rate zero. 


They weren't "introduced".


The user of a full node has significant security and privacy benefits over an SPV-client.

You're right, blockchains are a bad tool for voting. But the video you link to just says that naive e-voting is bad idea. That's not the reason blockchains are bad for voting. The reason is that there are (non-naive) protocols using homomorphic encryption or mixing that achieve what is needed (universal and individual verifiability and vote secrecy). There's simply no need for a blockchain. I think bitcoin's contribution to voting will be different. The biggest problem in voting is the so-called secure platform problem: the devices you vote on can be hacked. Now, hardware wallets happen to be exactly the kind of device you'd need instead...

Thanks for a brilliant explanation!

No, of course not. Or do you mean "...to prevent the survival of the old chain"? I don't think that could be prevented.

Ah yes, the illusion of the immediate credit card payment.

I just don't see the point. What's the added value over the much cheaper option of just using a central server at the university? You have to trust the university anyway. Also, anybody can write to the blockchain -- so whatever is written has to be signed by the university and validated by the employer. However you do that, it's unlikely to approach the simplicity of just checking that a certain name/degree/year appears at a university's website with a green certificate icon. What am I missing?

It's simple. There are no individual coins -- just as there are no individual dollars in bank accounts. If I transfer 10 dollars to your bank account, on which there already are 10 dollars, it's meaningless to ask which of those now 20 dollars are from me.

Technically, sure. Or did you intend to argue that it's a good idea to design a signature scheme that requires randomness for signing?

A lightning channel between you and me consists of bitcoins in a 2-of-2 multisig address jointly controlled by you and me. The uncommitted transactions we send between us only concern the coins in the channel. I can't send them to someone else without your approval.

It’s as close to an economic consensus as you can get: Deflation is bad for an economy, and central bankers should avoid it at all costs.
Then there’s Switzerland, whose steady growth and rock-bottom unemployment is chipping away at that wisdom.
At a time of lively global debate about low inflation and its ill effects, tiny Switzerland—with an economy 4% the size of the U.S.—offers a fascinating counterpoint, with some even pointing to what they call “good deflation.”
Consumer prices in Switzerland have fallen on an annual basis for most of the past four years. They hit a milestone last month with an annual price drop of 1.4%, the biggest in more than five decades. Even after food and energy prices are stripped out, core prices fell 0.7%.
“It’s hard not to call that deflation,” said Jennifer McKeown of Capital Economics, referring to the technical term for a sustained slump in consumer prices.
And yet evidence of deflation’s pernicious side effects—recession, weak employment, rising debt burdens—is pretty much nonexistent in Switzerland. Its economy is expected to expand this year and next, albeit slowly, in the 1% to 1.5% range. Unemployment was just 3.4% in September. Government debt is low.
“Usually people associate deflation with depression,” said Charles Wyplosz, a professor at the Graduate Institute in Geneva. “In the Swiss case, the economy is doing OK.”
Some of that success is due to the shattering of another long-held maxim: that central-bank policy rates can’t go negative to offset the effects of falling prices.
Switzerland, in a bid to sap demand for the franc and drive down the currency’s value, has a -0.75% rate on certain deposits parked at its central bank, meaning financial institutions pay to keep their money there. This effectively amounts to a negative real, or inflation-adjusted, policy rate because core inflation is typically a good indicator of underlying price pressure. Denmark and the European Central Bank have taken a similar path with their deposit rates.
Although wage growth has slowed in Switzerland, it was 0.6% on an annual basis in the second quarter, which combined with falling prices means strong real pay gains, boosting spending power. Meanwhile, the rate on a 10-year mortgage is only around 2%.
For years, central banks from Japan to Europe and the U.S. have been fighting mightily to buck up their inflation rates and escape the deflationary trap. The concern: that falling prices will prompt consumers to spend less—based on expectations that prices will continue to decline—and businesses will delay investment amid uncertainty about revenues.
The Great Depression and, more recently, Japan’s two-decade struggle with deflation, are typically cited as Exhibits A and B on why central bankers should do all they can to avoid the trap.
The Federal Reserve spent trillions of dollars from 2008 to 2014 on government bonds and mortgage debt to combat this risk. More recently, it opted to keep interest rates near zero six years into an economic recovery with the unemployment rate barely above 5%, in part because inflation is so low—unchanged over the year ended Sept. 30.
Major central banks prefer annual inflation of about 2% to provide a cushion against deflation.
Faced with stagnant consumer prices, the ECB is in the midst of a €1.1 trillion ($1.249 trillion) bond-buying program. The Bank of Japan has purchased broad swaths of public and private assets, too. The reasoning behind all these moves is that once deflation becomes entrenched, it is difficult to reverse.
But in Switzerland’s case, falling prices, brought on in large measure by what most analysts see as a significantly overvalued franc, has generated some positive fruits. It has forced companies to raise productivity and stay competitive in global markets, particularly compared to the rest of Europe.
Despite the franc’s strength, Switzerland’s trade surplus was nearly 5% of gross domestic product last year, suggesting its products are still competitive globally. Consumer spending continues to grow, albeit at about half the rate of three years ago.
“You have to distinguish between good and bad deflation,” said Alexander Koch, economist at Raiffeisen Schweiz in Zurich. “There’s no crash, no strong increase in unemployment in manufacturing and as there are no bursting bubbles in other sectors, domestic demand and the labor market are quite resilient.”
Maybe it’s the Alpine air, but economists at the Basel, Switzerland-based Bank for International Settlements—a consortium of central banks—have also challenged some of the conventional wisdom on deflation’s pernicious effects.
It may have negative consequences, but “on the other hand, deflation may actually boost output,” they wrote in a March report. “Lower prices increase real incomes and wealth. And they may also make export goods more competitive.”
So why aren’t central banks embracing the Swiss example? Analysts note that it’s difficult to distinguish between good and bad deflation until it’s too late.
Nor is Switzerland without its own struggles. To keep the franc in check, the central bank may be forced to cut the deposit rate even further, analysts say, particularly if the ECB eases policy more. Super-low rates on mortgages and other forms of debt could create housing and other bubbles. An abandoned effort to cap the franc’s value to the euro led the central bank to book a loss of 50 billion francs ($52.45 billion) for the first half of the year. And average consumer price levels are still quite high compared to the rest of Europe despite declines in recent years.
But, says Jörg Krämer, chief economist at Commerzbank in Frankfurt, Switzerland’s deflationary experience shows that for some, it’s “not as harmful as most people think.”

Yes, often you can. But that does not mean that the payment is immediate. The merchant has to wait for about a month until he can be sure that you actually paid him. The reason he lets you walk out of the store immediately is because he is willing to take the risk that he's not getting paid.

I asked myself the same question. Capital controls are hard to enforce. You make it illegal for people to exchange yuan for dollars. But it's obviously legal for people to invest yuan in order to produce something that they can export for dollars. Well, chinese miners make a convincing case that they are in the second category.
@_date: 2015-11-19 14:21:29
That's also my understanding. Why would anyone call blockchain analysis a "temporary aberration" just for that?

Good find! So, she obviously gets it.

Exactly my thoughts. How could this possibly be in Bitmains interest?
@_date: 2017-06-14 12:23:54


Except they won't! Legacy miners will follow the longest legacy-compatible chain, not Bitmains hard-fork.

If only there was a way to do so... :) Investors buy UASF coins, price rises, rational miners switch to the UASF chain. Now, I have no idea whether enough of that will actually happen. But if you want to know whether the UASF will be successful you should be focusing on investors, not miners.

I was specifically talking about the miners taking the first option (weren't you?). By splitting off, Jihan is making it more likely that they will follow the BIP148-chain. I'm still puzzled by that.

That's a wild claim, and I don't see you offering a shred of reasoning on why this should happen. Countries have been moving away from commodity-backed currencies. I'm not saying that's a good thing, but incentives are obviously aligned in such a way that they have done that. From what I can see, these incentives haven't changed. A central bank makes money essentially by printing it. Every other form of money (that they are not printing) is competition for them that they are incentivized to fight.
