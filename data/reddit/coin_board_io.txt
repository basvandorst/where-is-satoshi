True. Some of the methods from Coinbase are not available on GDax and vice-versa (in this case GDax offers more). But the price has to be the same as they come from the same exchange, right? 
I will switch to GDax in my app as they offer websocket endpoint (which allows constant streaming of price / trade changes).

Hehe i’m planing to add sorting functionality so the user can manually sort alphabetically or based on price on each column.
Any specific reason why Litecoin should be on the 2nd place?

Thanks, will do use GDax API from now on. It’s really confusing that they have 2 ...

Thank you :)
I aim to keep it that way as i add more coins and exchanges (and other functionalities).

Thank you.
I’m aware of similar (more) powerful apps, but the idea behind this app is to have a dashboard like overview of coin/token prices with usability and simplicity in mind. In any case it is built on modern web technologies that allow it to have native like capabilities. If you’re using Android you can add it to your home screen (without going to the Play store) and you’ll see that it’ll behave like an Android app (similar for iOS).
In any case thank you for your feedback.

The choice of domain was guided by availability in the first place and a bit of word play - coin[dash]board as the idea was that this app will be a dashboard showing the coin prices across various markets/exchanges.
Thanks for you feedback :)
