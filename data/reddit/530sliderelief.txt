With the new donations that just came in about $6400. I sold at 450$
@_date: 2014-03-30 19:39:14
Looks like we're waiting, so hopefully they see what's going on.
@_date: 2014-04-10 00:39:38
It's already been donated in cash.
@_date: 2014-04-10 04:50:54
Gave what? 
@_date: 2014-03-28 20:39:07
We tried getting in contact with Coinbase multiple times but did not get a response, same from Bitpay sadly. We went with Coinbase because we are both more familiar with them. Link has been added.

Edited our comment to have a link directly to the town webpage.

Working on it, we've had contact with one of the major news outlets in the Seattle area (KOMO) and we're hoping they can send out a tweet.

Anything helps right now. We're looking at getting Doge donations, we wanted something set up with Moolah but they said there is a new charity feature coming out soon and to wait for that.

[Link to original post](
[The town donation page](
Still working on hooking up the bank account, so for now we have transferred the BTC to Blockchain so the address is public and you can monitor your donations:
[1JABL93BGgCrjtVn1NsuR2f1K3SEvXq294]( 
Coinbase donations through the original button on the town website will still work if you want to do that instead. All BTC will be sold for USD when we get the bank account hooked up early next week. Here is a [Bitcoin Magazine]( press release on what is going on. 
Thank you again, everyone!
Edit: Just to be clear, if you donate through the Coinbase button on the town website the donation WILL NOT show up on the public blockchain address. Both addresses do work and will be combined early next week. We just added a Blockchain address due to requests for transparency.
Edit 2: Huge thanks to who just donated 1 BTC! 
@_date: 2014-03-30 07:29:51
Thank you very much.
@_date: 2014-03-30 03:25:37
Awesome, thank you! 
@_date: 2014-03-30 21:00:32
That's awesome thank you!
@_date: 2014-03-28 20:40:42
Thank you! Really wish we could have direct USD conversion set up right now but we thought it would be best to get something going as soon as possible. 
@_date: 2014-03-30 07:44:41
I hope he notices!
@_date: 2014-04-01 01:50:53
After 13 BTC in donations it's the least we can do.
@_date: 2014-03-30 03:45:10
Its going into a general town fund "At this time, those affected by this disaster would benefit most from monetary donations to cover needs, including housing, transportation and medical expenses."  
@_date: 2014-03-30 20:56:45
Thank you for helping!

So legit! Much thanks!

We don't have an official twitter presence at the moment, but we will try and let them know.
@_date: 2014-03-30 01:11:38
Already set up, thanks for the reminder though!
@_date: 2014-03-30 06:36:07

Thank you!

Awesome thank you!

@_date: 2014-03-30 07:27:35
That is awesome, every donation is as important as the last. Thank you.
@_date: 2014-03-30 03:34:43
Most definitely, I think if you use this option it will go directly to the address: 
+1JABL93BGgCrjtVn1NsuR2f1K3SEvXq294 
@_date: 2014-03-30 07:46:56
The address is different because we set up a block chain wallet so the transactions would be transparent. The donations on the Darrington site go to our coinbase account. All donations will end up in the same place so its up to you.
@_date: 2014-03-30 18:11:31
I was worried about this and forgot to mention it. IRS probably wouldn't ignore a couple thousand $ going in and then directly out. 
@_date: 2014-04-10 03:46:04
live long and prosper my good man!
