The 200MA has dropped an average of $19  per day over the past 7 days. If we assume the average continues to drop $19 per day, the 200MA will be $6700 (today's price) around November 1.

Omg... I could not believe I was getting such a good deal up until the time when I was at the payment screen, thats when the awesomeness fully set in. Got a Das keyboard 4 pro, blue yeti microphone w/pop filter, wireless 360 controller, and MSI 750ti graphics card all for .71 btc ($350) :D BRING ON MORE BTC SALES
@_date: 2014-01-04 03:20:04
On coinbase, find your receive address, thats the address you should give to the seller to send you the bitcoins. Then, like others have said, just wait until they show up in the account and you're done!

I think the meaning behind this comic sarcastically hints that he really was a fool because he wanted something worthless (magic beans) instead of bitcoins. And if you remember the fairy tale, the magic beans just caused trouble.

If you have your money stored in a bank, no you do not have total control over that money. I was not referring to the control of price at all, not sure why you would assume that. 
Could you elaborate as to how national currencies are not printed at will? The treasury department has control over how many dollars are printed in the US depending on demand. That is why the dollar has lost a majority of it's purchasing power in its history. No single person can choose to create extra BTC. In other words decentralization is the major reason why I might choose to use this BTC debit card over my bank debit card.

The most benefit would be to the tourists if they were able to spend bitcoin without having to exchange their currency to Reais. Unfortunately bitcoin has not caught on in Brazil nearly as strongly as in the US or other parts of the world and not many merchants accept it as payment.

I agree completely. Words make a big difference in people's subconscious minds.

Same deal with Spaincoin. Bitcoin is already a global currency..  I don't see the need for country coins.

Let's not stoop to their level. Over at r/btc It's nothing but insults and desperate attempts to compare bch to bitcoin because that's pretty much all they have left. Ignore them and let them fade into irrelevancy. I used to post there, but I'm giving it up since its pointless to try to save any of them. They have been thoroughly brainwashed.

I guess im confused on the different implementations. The node I'm running is 0.5.2 beta. I wrongfully assumed this was a build of the same implementation that hadn't released to the public yet.

It would not only be an app, but also a built in hardware wallet. Meaning, a secure chip which stores the private keys separately from the rest of the phone. That's the rumor anyway.

The barrier to entry to purchase land is much much greater than the barrier to entry to investing in bitcoin. Also I can't pay someone else in land. I cant transfer land into someone else's name very easily. Someone else needs to want to buy the land.
@_date: 2018-11-22 15:09:47
Supply, demand, and speculation. It would be impossible for the value to go up forever. At some point it needs to come back down as speculators discover the true price of an asset. As more users join the bitcoin network over time, another spike and drop in price will eventually happen. Market cycles.

Although as seen here, the tamper stickers ARE pointless, but that does not necessarily make the product useless. I think they could have given us a better sense of security by placing the sticker correctly (like on the front), but that's all it is, a false sense of security. If someone wanted to sabotage the device, that sticker is not going to stop them.
I felt much better after finding this reply by in one of the other threads:

A lot of people got rekt this past year. You're not alone. It's not easy, and it's definitely not quick. But I believe you DO profit if you stick to bitcoin long enough and not these other ICOs and shitcoins.

Bitcoin lightning wallet on Android.
is one. I don't know about others, but would also like to know.
@_date: 2018-12-28 15:55:45
How does someone earn fees from operating a lightning node? Does the node operator need to open multiple channels with balances, or is just one channel? Is just having the node online automatically earn those fees, or is any other set-up required to earn them?
edit: also does the balance of an open channel impact the amount of fees you can earn?
@_date: 2013-04-12 23:07:59
