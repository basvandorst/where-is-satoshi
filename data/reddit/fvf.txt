Good question fam. Here's the answer: You're not paying taxes because the government needs money. You are paying taxes because the government (or rather, society in general) needs you to do your job. If the baker doesn't make bread, nobody will eat bread, and so on.
In other words, money (like gold, bitcoin, etc etc) has no intrinsic *value*. Your work and produce has value.

Grow fruit in your garden, and you can keep it all in your basement I'm sure.
Modern society, i.e. infrastructure, requires a cooperative communal effort.

If a house is overpriced by a million dollars, that's equally bubbly to a million dollars placed in something with little or no intrinsic value (like gold...)


Nobody even pretends this is why gold is highly priced.


Again, gold has its status primarily for historical reasons. Which happen to extend back long before being "an amazing conductor" had even any meaning.

Housing bubbles are common.


This is simply not true. Gold's most valuable characteristic is that there's a limited supply. As a raw material it has its uses, but nothing that remotely justifies its status as "money". It has simply become a convention, for historical reasons.

You are simply being ridiculous.

That's just patently false.
