The panic in here is insane. What happened to buying and holding for 3+ years? Chill people 
@_date: 2018-01-18 17:08:23
Dude what the hell, you don't sell, you hold

Top level analysis. A+

What's that called?
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:29:06
yes you can
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:11:13
Can we just dump this garbage and not pay taxes since we never actually bought it in the first place?

How is the internet ever going to be mainstream adopted when it's so slow and hard to use and it crashes every time you get a phone call?
@_date: 2018-03-09 05:50:26
Don't people dollar cost average any more?

Amazing there are so many people here that are smarter than Peter Thiel. How nice of you to offer your advice on reddit for free when you could be out making billions with your great genius.

You probably shouldn't be in crypto at all if you're so easily shaken up and emotionally erratic.

Some of us just want to own bitcoin and don't want to day trade. Is that ok?
@_date: 2018-02-06 17:53:22
But why would I sell when I am still buying?
@_date: 2017-09-05 15:25:48
Is there any way to obtain btc with fiat other than using an external exchange of some kind?
@_date: 2018-03-15 20:33:14
Sure, but you're the one telling people they should be day trading. I'm just a peasant buying a few bucks worth every pay check.
@_date: 2018-03-09 06:53:18
dude don't sell for at least 3 years

same reason they hate Trump - MSM said "bad"
