I read this suggestion before and hope that those involved with the project seriously consider it. Messaging is Everything.

In my experience "BTC-e support" is a contradiction in terms.
@_date: 2013-11-19 21:17:31
BTC-e banned my account with no explanation after I changed my password twice in a day ( I was afraid my computer was insecure/account had been hacked) . MOST of my bitcoin is trapped inside. I'm getting little to no response from support... Just the occasional nonsensical note of advice. Needless to say I don't recommend them. Im starting to think that's how they avoid having shortages...by banning people and taking coin. Lesson learned.

Seconded. I've used them for a couple of months. Low fees. Super friendly and quick responses. Money in my account same day or next day.

"I tried with various other IPs and devices and every time I have been told that the new IP is also banned."

Hugolp already sorta explains this... 
"Its worth noting that Baidu said that they stopped accepting Bitcoin not because it was forbidden as a currency, but because they did not know and wanted to be cautious."
It makes perfect sense that they'd pull out of the BTC until the dust settles... But maybe I'm just seeing with rose- colored goggles. Regardless, I'm gonna go buy me some -- what I consider -- discounted coins.

Good to know you were reimbursed something from them. I've been getting a Really sketchy vibe over my predicament, but yea, BTC-e is surely completely swamped at present. I'll keep sending friendly support requests and bitching on reddit about them. Hopefully someday they will get around to me. I wish there was a more detailed FAQ or 'help' section to explain whether an automated security freeze kicked in or some such. They could have at least sent some message explaining the ban (and its duration). As it stands i just get to sit and wonder if I have been robbed.  (Even a "fuck off, we're keeping your money" would be somewhat helpful)

If/When I withdraw from VOS you mean? Good to know. Thanks for the tip.

The Bitcoin network is a public ledger that can be used for other things besides bitcoin transactions. Someone can surely explain this better than I... But could the present and future functionality of the Bitcoin network not be considered -- if not a pretty thing -- a profoundly useful thing?

I deposit directly into the VOS account, bypassing wire transfer fees. Slightly higher currency conversion fee (I dont convert at the bank--i have a special rate elsewhere) so it's a multi-step process for me but saves me a bit of money. I'd rather work directly with CAD though. I am new to the game however. Perhaps there are better ways. VOS say they are getting an online bill payment option (like cavirtex has) because Bank of Montreal has been giving them a hard time about all the money being deposited into their account (absolutely comical).

Well said. I figure I paid a modest ticket price to enter a wonderous new economy and got some spending money to boot.

I'm in the exact same position. Recently bought for the first time at 370. I'm fighting the urge to sell high then buy low, but I'm taking solace in the fact that hanging on to my tiny coin helps the community at large.

The cynic in me also figures on top of being crazy busy they are also inconceivably wealthy now and would be hard pressed to consider the needs of a peasent like me. I'll be sure to shower them with praise if they get around to my situation.
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:22:39
I sent a few today. I intend to follow-up daily. It would be nice to talk to an online admin about it. Hopefully you are right... just an automated security trigger or a temporary ban until the 2 day waiting period passes. I'm trying not to get my hopes up. I've read other threads where such issues were resolved.

I'm laying low for a bit... Licking my wounds and hanging on to my remaining chump change. I started with Vault of Satoshi then foolishly treaded into the wider waters thinking I could increase my coins. I'm bearish at heart and should have just held on to em. Prices are slightly higher at VOS but trades are fast and cheap and I trust them. I'd try BTC-e again if this gets sorted out. I hope it does. I can't really afford for it not to. 
@_date: 2013-12-12 10:42:15
Sadly no. That's one drawback of VOS. They assure me they will be accepting CAD soon. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:27:52

Fine and noble of bitpay. But what gives? Why Wikipedia no want free money?
