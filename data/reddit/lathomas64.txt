easily accessible for people without computers for one.
Able to get cash out of the other end instead of bitcoin.
Cheaper than western union &amp; its cohorts.
If you have a service that combines all three of those things it would likely *eventually* be successful. Would take a while before people trust/adopt it. It would also be a service like the others that basically accepts payment/pays out in local currency or in bitcoin. A lot of the time you are wiring someone like a relative money because they had some accident or unexpected bill come up and you can't take bitcoin to your landlord.

I think people need to be able to buy all their necessities first in bitcoin. People would be much more willing to take bitcoin paying jobs when they can pay rent and buy groceries in bitcoin at reasonable rates.

No problem!

wait you mean someone mining bitcoin is anonymous?

you wouldn't have any confirmations if you published the transaction over NFC. you wouldn't have to bring up a QR code and hold your phone still while the other person scans with NFC though. Just send your address straight over to their phone so they can send the coins.

It doesn't make them impossible, just increases the cost.

looks like the bitcoin payments are up and working now.

This isn't really violating that section, if he was letting people play the games on his account it would be, but buying games and gifting them to people doesn't violate the quoted passage.

I think s/he means societal collapse. I.e. no electricity for miles

I still think being able to get your utilities in BTC would be more valuable as people would be less likely to see it as Fake money.
@_date: 2012-03-09 16:11:11
This would be much more of an issue if you couldn't just put your app on a different marketplace

At least not within the walls of ba sing se

I just tried out  and it worked out for me. Got the coins confirmed after a few minutes and paid via my debit card. No accounts to sign up for or anything.
@_date: 2012-02-21 18:39:06
Why stop at utility bills? If you could pay for rent and buy groceries you could stop transfering to fiat currencies all together.
@_date: 2012-02-09 17:03:36
security for the seller and accesibility to the general public seem like they will always be at odds here. Verifying the identity of the buyer, limits based on how much info, how often etc. may make things better for the seller but also make them more inconvenient for the buyer. People have mentioned that it was only 1/3rd of people that did chargebacks perhaps the best solution is a combination of quantity limits for new customers combined with including in your mark-up the cost of chargebacks you recieve. kind of like how stores include a mark-up to cover the cost of items that get stolen.

people who don't want to hold a balance of the currency but use it instead. It makes a lot of sense if you are regularly transacting and are generally near zero. Although it will be a problem if Everyone is doing just that and I don't see why anyone who isn't doing that would use this system. It'd just end up being a form of paypal without the potential to become a currency like bitcoin has...
you're right who in their right mind would prefer this...
@_date: 2012-08-30 11:31:40
not at all.
@_date: 2012-03-31 16:46:42
why not?

which means the original point still stands about pedophilia in the context of public perception. I wasn't trying to imply that it was correct to to lump things together.
@_date: 2012-04-10 14:25:29
lots of people conflate pedophilia with anything dealing with any underage person.
@_date: 2012-04-10 14:24:00
17 years old isn't pedophilia. pedophilia is prepubescent

how do you do bitcoin transactions via paypal?
jim wants a hamburger
John has a hamburger and offers to give it to jim for 1 BTC
jim and john both take out there phones
John uses NFC to tell Jim's phone his bitcoin address
jim uses his bitcoin app to send 1 BTC to the address he got from John over NFC.
how do you do that(in BTC) with google checkout or paypal?

I was referencing 1984, which the rage song also referenced, but I'm not talking about [the author] directly but the poster above me's comment about not revising the past.

What are your issues with the title? How could the article have been titled better?
@_date: 2013-05-17 18:49:02
As for the title I just used the article's original title without any modification.

Um, no its not. It talks about an economic activity. It'd be racist to assume a specific person does so because they are asian but acknowledge an activity that occurs in specific country is by no means any more racist then it would be to acknowledge that some Americans eat peanut butter and jelly sandwiches in an article studying the economic impact of peanuts.

what is this?

First of all thank you for taking the time to make arguments instead of just making completely unhelpful comments like wtf or making ad hominems about the author.
Second while it is not an account containing bitcoin I think the adjective still applies as the sole purpose of the USD account is to make exchanges with people for bitcoin.
I think these details mis the point of the huge deal that is the US government taking a major step against a bitcoin exchange.
