Put some in my ChangeTip wallet, sent some tips, and with the rest I'm exploring the new world of cloud mining!

Been playing for half an hour now.
I've been sent around 42c worth of bits.
I also collected all the letters and won 2000 in game bits and got rid of the ads :)
Loving it.

Yeah. 
I was hoping that too, but getting rid of the ads made me happier.

Satoshi. 
A fictional dinosaur/dragon from Nintendo's Mario Bros universe. 
He is green, lays eggs, wears red boots and a saddle, and has a long tongue that kind of works like a weapon or grappling hook. 
...aaaaannnndddd I seem to be confused.
