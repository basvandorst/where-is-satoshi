Are you sure $100K USD is enough? Remember, theymos doled out $350K USD as a down payment of the $1M USD total to upgrade this forum several months ago. To date, nobody can yet update their avatar image. But, perhaps, the developer is holding that aspect fix hostage till the ransom of another $350K USD is paid. Seems, everybody wants to be a terrorist these days.
Note to self: Don't make a habit of penning the words hostage, ransom and terrorist in the same post, for it fucks with the NSA too badly.
Also: $100,000; one million; down payment; $1,000,000; $350,000; fix; payment; developer; paid; Dole; avatar; image; days; everybody; or theymos.

This is a very good point. But there will be and maybe there is already (see cryptonote technology) a way for the one who wants it to free himself from the tyranny of government and its oppression towards your privacy.

I'm heading to Amsterdam in July, I may have to pay a visit and see how it works. I'm guessing that there are some local businesses that accept BTC as payment?

 Voorhees is a self interested blockchain spammer that never cared about anything except lining his own pocket. He's a great preacher that spreads the gospel better than Pat Robertson on the 700 club but that doesn't make him wholesome. He's a self interested profiteer and nothing more.

so this brings up an interesting topic.. if you want to evade paying taxes and have a lot of bitcoins, just start up your own non-profit charity.

Put it this way, regardless of his intention he is still a celebrity with a lot of followers tweeting about bitcoin so it's free publicity and will hopefully pique peoples' interest.

With their extreme corruption and evidence linking them to some of the biggest scams in Bitcoin (MTGox) and murders made to look like suicides. Now with the revelation that KNC didn't actually pay the $100k under proper procedure or even more likely at all to vote for Brock Pierce and elect him. Honestly what will it take to rally together the Bitcoin community and take these scumbags down?

Where can I find reliable statistics on their use? Bitcoiners always go on and on about how great these ATM's are, with their biometric scanners, their blood sample analysis tools, and their fees ... But for some reason, the number of actual users is never mentioned ...?

Really, how much less?
When possible (from anyone who's able), I would like to see a real world comparison of Western Union/(USD/Peso)&gt;&gt;Spend at *cheaper* store vs. USD&gt;&gt;Coinbase/Pademobile&gt;&gt;&gt;Spend at 7/11.
Sounds good at first though...
