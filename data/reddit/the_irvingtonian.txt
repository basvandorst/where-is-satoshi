Which ones?  I’m not aware of any recent bills...

You are wrong. It’s theirs until you prove you weren’t.
“That’s illegal!”
Yep. Sure is.  SCOTUS will notice any...day...now...

The title is sarcasm, folks.

BTC is dropping, move everything into Schrute Bucks.

True, but it will stabilize once investors learn to consult the ledger instead of dubious media leaks before making decisions, and it will become more widespread once it stabilizes so vendors can learn more about how it works.  Right now, the incentive to speculate is high because only a few people actually know what they're doing *and* have the wealth needed to dupe large numbers of people.

When you buy on Coinbase, it takes a week to get your coins, plus/minus a day. So if you want coins before the fork, you gotta get them between today and Tuesday. Today is Friday, Friday is payday.
EDIT: with obvious exceptions, someone above pointed out.

Start one. Apparently anyone can.

Yes, but with BTC you can also stockpile it and treat it like bullion. It's the best of both worlds.

I thought it meant, "Hold On for Dear Life."

My guess is since it takes a week for buys to materialize, everyone is trying to get in before the split.  Am I wrong?  Let me know.  I bought today for that reason, anyway, so this could just be me.

Ah, yes.  The U.S. regulators are basically fear-mongers that close their eyes to active scams, allow them to collapse so they can set up paywalls, legislate complicated licensing requirements, and become self-appointed sherpas through a maze they themselves cultivate.  Everywhere else, regulators are...well, regulators.  They find and punish fraudulent activity.
