man, do understand, that faucet and autofaucets of btc dont give 1 btc per hour, the btc is a hard-crypto, so calculate 5 sats per 4 minutes, you know that other faucets gives you only 5 sats per hour, and autofaucets for btc are even harder, the pb with ppl, its the amalgam they do between doge and btc, sure on certain sites you can have 1 or more doge per day, but not btc, btc worth 10 k usd, doge worth 0.003 usd thats the difference and why huge doge claims

as long as cryptos are on traditional stockmarkets they will still the victims of harrassments from federal reserve and some others, government agencies, the sec, professional hackers working for nsa and so on and coding their viruses ... in korean and other so they can divert the culpabilities, speculators which im one of them, ..., as long as cryptos were only traded over crypto markets the effects were minimized once you enter in trade markets you'll be targeted by all above and many others including ppl as soros-rockefeller-rothschild-..., many infos are that ppl like that are investing into btc, ppl like that only invest to take control including wrecking btcs, royal bank of england such as soros, and so on, so the only way out for cryptos is to get out from traditional trade markets, im speculator on them and i deeply know what im talking about, this is now a take control game with political purposes for some including ppl who are fighting cryptos i mean they want them to disappear because of ideology differences, and simple speculators who are trying to make gains over your losses, and all of them are like trump or globalists they are stuck in killing another chicken with golden eggs, so just enter into contact with crypto board and founders if known and tell them to get out of their or their losses wont stop, i predicted the new falls of btc and other cryptos just compare the dates from the first fall from 15 K us dollars
