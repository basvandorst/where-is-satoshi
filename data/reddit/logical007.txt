four things about this make it a scam:
- There's already a wallet called "BitWallet" and this impersonator stole their name/icon
- Green Address doesn't make this wallet. Also they misspelled "adress"
- They link to Bitcoin.org as the developer website.
- This is the open source code for breadwallet. It looks just like breadwallet, except they threw a "bitWallet" name inside the app.
Scam written all over it. We've had 11 apps that look just like this one the past week pop up

ios - breadwallet and copay
android - breadwallet, mycelium and copay

A few days before all of these wallets flooded the apple store there was an imposter breadwallet app that Apple for some reason approved. (it was promptly taken down, it used the breadwallet logo and name)
breadwallet confirmed that impostor wallet was stealing people's funds for the few people who downloaded it.
all these new wallets that have flooded the Apple Store all at once (and stealing many other wallets' likeness) are sharing the same similarities as the breadwallet imposter wallet

I recognize you have a good product. For example if Circle were to go out of business, or go away from Bitcoin, then I would use you again. (Unless a cheaper service that is just as reliable came to be) 
You have a great service (I gave you probably $50k of business in 2013) however if I don't have to pay more, I'm not going to.

Possibly they will at some point require that finance apps can only be published by devs who provide a certain amount of identification. (or, as some have suggested, devs who prove that extra bit of identity will get a "verified" sticker of sorts from the apple/google store, while the rest will be allowed but not have that sticker)

even if you lost your breadwallet phone, your funds would still be secure. (just recreate the wallet on another phone with your passphrase)
I did speak of separate hardware implementations in that post, other than a phone
edit: in my opinion (I'm just one person) a phone wallet that securely stores it's keys on the device are "good enough" security for 99% of individuals. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 04:41:15
1. make sure you have the recovery phrase
2. delete the breadwallet app from the phone
3. download breadwallet from the apple store (only the legit one is up now)
4. if it asks you to, re-input the recovery phrase

Honestly man you're probably just safer keeping it in breadwallet on iOS or Android. (I'm just speaking in terms of an easy wallet with hardware you probably already own)

When (if) Bitcoin is $10,000, each Bit will be 1 cent. 
I like it, as there are no decimal places. So a $10 movie ticket will be 1,000 Bits.

Oh hi Luke. We have a network that can only (with current Segwit adoption) handle ~400,000 transactions per day. This is an absolute nightmare, and I’m ashamed of the developers who pushed us into this with their ideals.
Can I be honest with you? I’m sincerely not trying to be rude. Bitcoin is a terrible user experience because of this congestion. Maybe you’re fortunate enough not to have to deal with this, but people are CONSTANTLY bitching about the fees and congestion and after using bitcoin for nearly 5 Years now, I don’t even want to recommend that people use it or buy it. 
At this point I don’t even care if bitcoin loses its dominance and “another coin” takes its place. I know it’s a stretch, but I’d rather another coin becomes the dominating one if it means giving up the ability for every user to afford a node.
It’s just too stressful, and even with Lightning the block size as is wont be enough,

Can I Kindly ask why posts like this get upvoted so much?
I personally don't see much to celebrate when it comes to posts like this (I'm the biggest Bitcoin bull you'll ever meet). These posts essentially mean two things:
1. The mempool size has gone down recently.
2. Not very many people worldwide are trying to use bitcoin at the moment.
Those two things together aren't encouraging.

I don’t have a short sighted personal grudge, you’re just not happy that I don’t share your opinion.
The fact is that hard forking to a larger block size doesn’t hurt decentralization to the effect you think, and this network can only handle 400k~ txs a day, it’s absolutely terrible. 
Luke’s vision of “every user running a node” isn’t a realistic one and is hurting the bitcoin network. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 04:46:01

@_date: 2018-01-06 20:37:13
Do you know why he “attacks” it as you so put it? Because people using bitcoin on a large scale for a business is absolutely terrible at times (I know from experience). At this moment BTC can only handle 400,000~ transactions a day, it is so tiny and makes for a terrible user experience. People are constantly complaining about issues (delays) which aren’t your fault. 
It really isn’t fun or glamourous, there’s a reason he’d want another coin to at least have a chance of providing some relief for users.

@_date: 2018-01-08 04:39:16
You don’t understand, and I didn’t try to prove your point.
People aren’t trying to use it for the value proposition anymore because the fees to transfer it off of an exchange are too high.
Most people can’t buy $1000 at a time. They’ll buy $100, then to send it off an exchange they lose $15 in fees.
It’s a terrible situation that will only get worse until the majority decide it’s worth it to give up the ability for every user to run a node if it means fees are 5 cents. 
@_date: 2019-07-04 15:18:50
You need to speak to why this app has hundreds of 5 star reviews. Don’t ignore this question.
@_date: 2018-01-08 06:09:38
Luke, you do realize that (as of today) the network is only processing ~400k transactions per day, right? 
Do you also realize that the world has over 7 Billion people?
I just want to make sure you know these two things? That’s all I’m kindly asking. 
@_date: 2019-07-20 18:27:05
1. Isn’t a valid argument. You can hide the coins you don’t wish to use.
2. It does support connecting to your own bitcoin node.
BRD is the most user friendly and safest mobile wallet available

@_date: 2017-12-23 16:51:31
I appreciate your response.
I just want to share some examples so maybe you can see why many of these types of businesses (BitPay, Coinbase, etc) are being proactive.
I know the management of a Bitcoin wallet company, and even if all Bitcoin users are provided Segwit and use it, that one wallet company's daily active users alone would be 30% of the Bitcoin network's daily capacity. That is immensely troubling, and very hard to manage. That is why you'll see many companies next year rolling out Bitcoin cash support. They honestly wish that they didn't! But not doing so is too painful, because their users continually scream and yell at them about fees/confirmation times, etc. It is not a fun experience, not in the least bit. 
You want to know my personal strategy? (If high fees continue?) Due to the fork, I have both Bitcoin and Bitcoin cash. For all intents and purposes I'm "tapped out" because I went all in during 2013. So I'll keep my Bitcoin, and begin using Bitcoin cash for transactions. 
Beyond that, I sincerely don't know which coin I'll buy for "investment purposes". Most likely Bitcoin, but I can't say for sure.
Anyways, I don't really think we'll reach the point where Bitcoin cash will disappear, maybe it'll never be as popular as Bitcoin....but if things such as the lightning network never really come to fruition, people don't really care about "ideals". They'll just want to use what is quick, cheap, and appears to work (even at the expense of bigger blocks)

What is the reason for a node rebroadcasting after 2 weeks of not confirming? 
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:00:24
Bread app
@_date: 2018-09-28 04:03:08
Bread is SPV. There are currently no wallets in existence with Segwit that are SPV. (No, Samourai is not SPV as told by their devs)
That is because SPV wallets have resource intensive syncing requirements.
Now that they’re supporting bech32 Segwit instead of adopting Segwit last fall, there will be fewer resources of the mobile device dedicated to syncing for the other address format. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:01:03
I like your spirit.
@_date: 2017-12-18 04:44:13
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:02:14
Whoever downvoted me above, you must not realize that the network can only handle less than 400k tx/day. It's a compete shit show. This means only 400k happy people a day are getting their txs confirmed.
@_date: 2017-12-28 15:08:48
There is a regular or economy fee option in Bread. You don’t overpay 
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:57:16
Sure them over what grounds? Lol
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:55:42
what does that mean, though?
I recognize what network effects are (the original), but it is not the best (at the moment) for everyday people.
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:16:14
I consider BitPay a bit of a trend setter, and while they're not adding litecoin to their invoices, they are launching Bitcoin cash support in the coming months.
@_date: 2017-12-28 16:19:11
Right now economy is 150 sat/byte, and there are 14,000~ transactions pending to be confirmed with that fee or higher. 
If you go lower on fees (at this particular moment) you risk a transaction getting stuck for days/weeks in this environment. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:54:53
Well, if BitPay supports it for their invoices soon (like they say the would), then I'm just going to HOLD my BTC and use BCH for my day to day use. 
I don't feel like I'm at risk as because of the fork, I have my 'insurance' with the other coin.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:31:56

Thanks for the insight. 
Forgive if I word this question oddly, but how did this make its way into a public release? Are there not enough people reviewing the code?

Breadwallet is one of them, yes
@_date: 2015-12-29 01:49:07
(As of now I do use circle to acquire btc however)
@_date: 2017-12-30 01:29:40
I think it’s interesting if you look at reviews for every wallet someone will always end up calling it “garbage”. This is the reality we live in where the network can only handle 400,000k txs a day (at its current levels of Segwit adoption)
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:10:57
because it can't be used. only 375,000 tx a day can confirm
@_date: 2015-12-21 16:19:20
You get 3% back when buying any cards on Gyft with Bitcoin. Try refreshing the app or contacting Gyft
@_date: 2018-09-28 14:55:19
While undoubtedly some will call this a great move, this will only vastly confuse their users and will slow down their growth significantly. I use Bitcoin daily and I can't even tell you what .00032123 BTC is worth as it changes on a daily basis, and will for decades to come. 
@_date: 2015-12-21 14:46:12
Remember, if for some reason Gyft doesn't allow Wal Mart to be bought with Bitcoin, you can still buy a GYFT gift card with BTC, and use that to buy the Walmart one 
@_date: 2018-09-05 14:21:36
They’re not “known” for that. It just happened sometimes and it gets shared on Reddit. It’s usually when someone tries to convert something like bitcoin (a lot of it) into an untraceable coin. It’s government forced regulation, not something they want.
@_date: 2018-09-25 03:49:01
That’s true. 
@_date: 2015-12-23 19:42:49
It will confirm eventually, sorry you're waiting.
A few years from now: "Remember the days when the majority of Bitcoin wallets made you choose the fee? Ah, so funny :) "
@_date: 2015-12-17 17:57:47
Makes sense.
On Purse I've gotten a good reputation (30 positive reviews) so I decided to up my discount from 25% to 29%. Had an order fill the same day! We'll have to see if the trend continues :) (I don't think I'll go higher than 29%)

@_date: 2015-12-17 17:47:43
I just called them. The woman on the phone (she was nice) seemed knowledgeable and said she hopes eventually Bitcoin can be used with Wal-Mart, but she's not sure. She said some deals that are made with merchants require certain payment methods to be used. 
**Edit**: The workaround we know to work requires buying a GYFT gift card from Gyft, then exchanging that into a Wal-Mart one. (for the times you really need to get a Wal-Mart card with Bitcoin and don't mind extra steps)
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:11:37
but didn't you get the memo? You're a SHILL and a TROLL if you say that the network only handling 16k tx/hr is not enough .
@_date: 2015-12-04 00:26:54
he's not, he's just passionate like me about finding deals and use cases for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-12-16 00:44:40
I'm just gonna say this before someone else speaks against it: YES, it does count as a transaction if I acquire BTC on an exchange and transfer it to my wallet.
NO, people aren't just transferring tons of bitcoin over and over again back and forth to wallets they own. There's no point in doing so, people don't do it on a grand scale.
@_date: 2018-09-29 05:16:48
Actually, that is false. This thread  has 10 different users who dislike this change, and 9 different users who liked it.

It's 24 hrs now. Theymos has been really great, I've been chatting with him about it.
He laid out some options as he wants the scores hidden for "x" amount of time. One option he suggested is 6 hours, which I felt could be good. 
That way we could check breaking news in the morning, then come back after lunch to see how everyone is feeling in terms of how heavily opinionated a comment is.
@_date: 2015-12-17 15:48:13
I feel like it's a good thing for us all to agree on. On a personal level, I feel 6 hours is a good amount of time and anything longer really detracts from the experience of this sub for me.
It really does help to see how heavily opinionated we are towards a thought. I really hope he goes for the 6 hour option. Things move really quickly on this sub sometimes and I don't want to start digging through old threads for opinions and how heavily they're weighted.

I think there comes a time and place to stick to your guns. There’s also a time and place to listen to the feedback you’ve been hearing all day.
People aren’t going to like this change, and therefore they’re not going to recommend your wallet to others. 
This just makes everything more challenging, especially since BTC has such a small market cap in fiat terms. 
You need to listen to the feedback you’ve been seeing all day.
@_date: 2015-12-04 16:59:49
Just do a reddit search on this forum for Blockchain.info wallet - issue after issue over and over again.
Instead I recommend breadwallet or if you want to use a more traditional bank service, use Circle.

Yes. On the flip-side though, if BTC appreciates you don't reap any of the gains.

@_date: 2015-12-11 01:07:01
Circle effectively has the "no fees" plan by doing this: buy and sell prices are exactly the same. (there technically is a "hidden" fee to buy)
They're hoping that more people will buy from them than sell.
@_date: 2015-12-28 19:27:24
That's neat. I'd use that if I was paid in BTC, that's for sure

There will NEVER be a "FedCoin" which allows the owner of said coins to have 100% complete control and send to whomever he wants, whenever he wants, anywhere in the world.
@_date: 2015-06-23 14:23:33
Ideally the "good" wallets will monitor several factors, # of unconfirmed transactions being one of them, and adjust the fee automatically. Like a friend told me, "People don't want to manually "adjust a fee" for their Visa transaction to go through. They just want it to work."

It's a fairly common practice. I'd say stop worrying, Coinbase isn't trying to hack into your accountt and "steal funds"
@_date: 2015-12-15 20:08:08
I'm biased towards breadwallet, but for 99% of people I don't see why you'd need more control. No matter the market conditions, it will calculate a fee to get you in the next 1-2 blocks.
If you for example wanted to pay a fee that would get you into the next 6-10 blocks, and pay say 1 cent as opposed to 3 or 4. Then yes, you need another wallet.
@_date: 2015-12-29 16:48:42
breadwallet (IMO) is the best, yes

I haven't logged into Coinbase for nearly a year, but it's pretty straightforward. Just within your wallet you find something regarding "Your receive address". You then copy that address and use it to send to from Circle.
Regarding the fluctuations in value: two things at play - 1. The past few hours have been a bit volatile for the currency. 2. Different exchanges use different  valuations.
Merchants typically don't worry about exchange risk as they are using processors that guarantee the value.
@_date: 2015-06-11 14:12:33

@_date: 2015-06-30 18:36:45
It's pretty much a lack of education you've received regarding the network (future apps will do a better job of this, by not confusing the user through unneccessary "confirmation" alerts) - after 30 seconds the chances of a double spend are very very hard to accomplish. You're worried over nothing - you're only worried because there is a lack of education you've received on this subject (I say that kindly)
@_date: 2015-06-02 21:16:36
this is something incredibly random for someone just to "make up". I for one believe the guy until the site is up.
The company is small enough not to matter if it was a lie, and it makes no sense for someone who works there to come here saying it accepts Bitcoin when it doesn't.
@_date: 2015-06-16 16:20:53
In my humble opinion I think you somehow need to do away with the $5 yearly fee. It's so tiny yet at the same time will give people another reason not to try your service. Try to find other ways of income generation.
@_date: 2015-06-09 00:05:17
Pretty much. 
If people don't like it then they won't upgrade or will go to another "coin", simple as that 
@_date: 2015-12-29 14:52:41
It is your right to do that.
I'm just arguing for the 99% of Bitcoiners who won't know how to calculate a fee. When a 3cent fee gets you into the next 1-2 blocks, there's really no point in paying 1cent for getting into the next 6. (For most people)

It's all just speculation, don't get caught in that trap.

I don't really think many of you are acting rational in your "hate" for Coinbase and instead praising BitPay. They're completely different companies with different structures.
You would hate BitPay just as much if they were trying to follow in Coinbase's steps and allow hosted wallets for users. It's not Coinbase's fault, they're protecting themselves.
(Disclaimer: I'm a Circle user who withdraws to Breadwallet everytime. I have no allegiance to Coinbase - I only used them to acquire my 'investment' coins in 2013.

Consistently for 2~ years I've used Bitcoin for lots of commerce, and I can confirm the fees necessary are half that, 3 cents, and I consistently get into the next 1-2 blocks. 
In my real use experience that data is wrong. 
@_date: 2015-06-06 17:33:05
Use Breadwallet from now on.
@_date: 2018-09-29 05:24:24

fees are indeed lower when a segwit transaction doesn't have to be placed in a ps2h wrapper and instead uses bech32

I'm not of the mindset of "You shouldn't need privacy if you have nothing to hide", but nothing can really come of this. They can't take your money. They also can't track you as a person unless they're specifically targeting you and have compromised a service that has your identity attached alongside addresses that have been used to send you funds.

I don't know much about this company. Is it a big one in the world of trading?
@_date: 2015-12-08 17:15:38
In my opinion, I recommend breadwallet for short to medium term. (Disclosure, I'm involved with the company and have done tons of personal research on it)
For longer term, I use Electrum. Although that I feel in some cases, due to human error, breadwallet is actually safer than Electrum
@_date: 2018-08-21 22:09:13
BRD is SPV, and no other SPV wallets use Segwit yet due to technical challenges of limited device resources and syncing (No, Samourai is not SPV, as told by the devs themselves)
Last update is Segwit support will release this year, now that bech32 is further along in play. 
@_date: 2015-12-21 22:12:17

It's just not a realistic risk for common people to worry about. The transaction has propagated so far and so many nodes have seen it. If you're buying a car or a house, sure, wait for a confirmation.
@_date: 2015-12-17 17:52:52
We all have our opinions but I think we can at least get SOME of the "old days" of scoring back with a few hour delay. Don't get me wrong, I'm not a fan of the delay at all (as are most of you), but I don't have control over this sub and I'm trying to be helpful in some way.
@_date: 2015-12-16 06:35:10
Exactly. It's not necessarily the "miners" who will be running the nodes.
Even some Bitcoin companies today (not mining companies) run nodes to help the ecosystem and ensure their business runs smoothly.
@_date: 2015-12-08 06:17:17

@_date: 2015-12-22 15:11:21
I'm biased (but it's not blindly)
breadwallet handles fees appropriately. It looks at network conditions and chooses fees appropriately. Ever since August I've always had my transactions included in the next 1-2 blocks. (we're talking on average a meager 3 cent transaction)
@_date: 2015-12-21 16:28:09
hmmm. I'd reach out to them on that. Sorry to hear.
@_date: 2015-12-29 06:11:02
Appreciate it. Wish this was enabled by default. It would help prevent moderators on this subreddit from misleading people.
@_date: 2015-06-16 13:30:14
Doesn't make sense, they say "you shouldn't have to pay to access your money", then it says they charge a small low yearly fee to use their service? 
They get to sell/hold/etc and do what they please with your BTC when you deposit it (as it locks in the usd exchange rate at time of deposit). That in of itself is enough of a fee.
@_date: 2015-06-05 20:07:35
Good to see that it was corrected by someone - it will use Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-08-16 14:16:25
There is so much misinformation in this thread. BRD is the most secure mobile wallet as the Secure Enclave of iOS to this date has never been hacked. (Outside of government/high level operations which require access to the device)
There have been no funds lost due to hacking in BRD 
@_date: 2015-12-29 15:23:32
I think that's the disconnect a lot of 'hardcore' Bitcoiners have with reality (i'm not saying you're one of them)
The majority of people don't care about 3 hours vs 12. They just want it sent.
I'd argue that it's not essentially just a lottery, because in the past 6 months the ONE time I used a wallet that didn't determine the fee necessary (Electrum) I had a transaction that was pending for hours ( I do a lot of commerce with Bitcoin, send many transactions). There's a lot of work that goes into fee calculations, and they up your odds of a smooth experience dramatically. 
@_date: 2015-06-06 15:59:51
It's insane. They got $30 Million in funding and are acting like it's an operation running inside of someone's garage, and that person also has a separate part time job at a Pizza Place, preventing him to 100% focus on Blockchain.info. Over and over again there are issues.
@_date: 2015-12-20 03:25:29
It says it requires iOS 7.1 so I believe so!

Correct, I bought Bitcoin from an exchange, and then I'm receiving delivery of that purchase in my wallet.
@_date: 2015-12-29 00:29:20
I do TONS of commerce with Bitcoin and I very rarely spend more than 3cents for a transaction. Additionally, I don't run into "congestion" because I don't use wallets that give the option of choosing a fee, I use a wallet that knows which fee is needed.

@_date: 2014-08-31 19:43:07
Of course, you are correct.
However I just feel like you're wasting your energy. As of now (and even 2 years from now) they'd hardly have anyone pay with Bitcoin in store.
Right now the priority is getting all of the major online merchants to accept BTC. Then, the trickle down effect into brick and mortar stores will happen.
@_date: 2018-05-26 15:04:42
You’re making it more difficult than it needs to be. Use the BRD wallet. It uses the hardware encryption of your device, and nobody is going to hack into your wallet.

You make sense.
I was thinking in terms of Americans/countries with stable/boring economies. Those people won't stand for any fluctuation at all in exchange rate. 
Once the exchange rate is more stable, then the average person will BEGIN considering using things like Breadwallet, Blockchain.info, etc
@_date: 2014-07-25 03:04:58
To me it's not a bunch of hoops because I save at least 3% on every gift card. My Credit Card only gives 1% back on purchases so BTC is the winner here. (To my credit card's 'credit', gasoline purchased gets 3% back, something which I can't even buy yet with BTC)
I'm glad you've been able to do well on penny stocks. I tried in the past and didn't have much luck.

It's worth mentioning however, that BRD has never been hacked as a result of the hardware encryption of iOS/Android being breached. (or any wallet app that properly uses your phone's hardware for that matter) 
You should never take screenshots or type your seed anywhere outside of the app, which can be a huge breach of security. (such as a notepad application)

That's not the way the world works, especially in such a forward thinking space such as this.
Most likely scenario: they're understaffed, busy, and have other priorities that they believe will grow their company faster.
Worst case scenario: they're incompetent

@_date: 2014-12-29 04:22:36
It can scale. When there is economic incentive for the miners to do so, then they will raise the block size. Storage space gets cheaper and cheaper everyday and internet speeds continue to rise.
Again, you're thinking too small with a US consumer in mind. 
Additionally, when was the last time you bought an item online from a site that you don't already trust? (Or doesn't have high reviews) 
You don't. You don't search "buy video game" on google and then order from a site that is on the 50th page of google results. You buy from one of the major sites.
Additionally very early services like Circle insure people's deposits. They require 2FA and if funds are lost to no fault of your own you're covered.

@_date: 2014-07-18 14:38:02
I don't know how else to tell you, they're not going to do what you propose. They will stick to what they know: regulating the traditional banking system, collecting taxes on properties and watching for large purchases.
It's just like you said, they don't go after people but merely watch. If all of a sudden you
Have a huge house that has a tax assessed value beyond your range, it will raise red flags. If all of a sudden you have an expensive car and your reported income doesn't support it, they'll notice.
They already have a good enough system in place regarding taxes. They'll get there's without needing to police the Bitcoin network like you propose

Whenever I let emotion come into the picture I ask myself these things:
1. Do you really expect Bitcoin to just "disappear" someday? (Aside from a substantial security vulnerability that's discovered which "breaks" it)
2. Is it like myspace? No. MySpace was a company all working on the same goal. Bitcoin is a protocol where anyone can try to build what they want on it. 
Don't be silly. You have to also remember that those at Dell and PayPal are smarter than you. Are you really going to bet against them?

I know you took time and thought to type that whole article out, but I just can't see an Alt "taking over" Bitcoin which by it's very design is tied to the Dollar. One of the biggest  things people like about Bitcoin is it's not tied to any other asset, ride or die.
But as you've said, we're still in the early stages.
Also, people in the U.S. can use BitReserve.org for dollar pegging service (I've met one of the people who works there, he's really nice)

I just did a test run for a $25 card, very simple. They seem to have used a custom system for payments (they don't use a payment processor as far as I know)
They received my payment instantly, and now I'm awaiting the e card. I did google searches of them to guarantee they're legit (GiftcardGranny even has reviews of them)
**Edits: I see they sell Target for 4% off, Whole Foods for 3.3% off, CVS for 8% off. They're giving Gyft and EGifter a run for their money! The only thing they offer right now over CardFlip is a native App and instant gift cards (There's about an hour delay since they don't use a processor).**
As of this moment I'm doing a test for a $615.52 Lowes Gift Card (which has a 9% discount, I forgot the exact amount but it's 9% higher than $615.52). They are asking for a price of  1.30113708 BTC which amounts to $616.70 at the same time I check Preev for Bitstamp price. Pretty close exchange rate!
**Additional Edit**: Apparently if you reach out to them they will turn your account into 'Bulk Buyer' status, and every time you purchase $500 or more at once you get an additional 3% discount in addition to all the normal discounts!

There was no other $11.99, I gave $1 to their donation address and watched the film.

@_date: 2014-08-18 00:41:00
Nobody truly knows.
To me personally the best part about the Bitcoin protocol is that services can be built on top of it for people and they don't even need to know that it's being used. Kinda like how your mom types in  yet she has ZERO idea how it works.
@_date: 2014-09-08 18:52:34
Good point.
@_date: 2014-12-02 19:27:44

Sorry I don't know about Mint.

Ah yes! Only the Blockchain is important, and not Bitcoin the currency aspect, because the miners won't mind securing the network and buying hardware with no profit in sight! :)

No prob! It truly is groundbreaking because for the first time we can have this technology and have it be affordable to average people. You put the headset on and you're 'in' a virtual world. It doesn't look like you're merely looking at a phone screen. The most amazing part is sense of scale, depth of field. If you are standing next to a tree you need to look up to see the top of it. It's very cool :)
Here is the timeline we're looking at:
1. This Fall: The Samsung Gear VR launches (Powered by Oculus). This is the VR headset which uses the Note 4 as it's processor as well as the screen. They are doing AMAZING things with it considering it's powered by a phone.
2. Next Summer/Fall: The Oculus Rift releases. This is the BIG/most anticipated one. It is the one that plugs into a PC and can harness all the power a PC provides. It also (might) have screen enhancements and an even wider field of view.

@_date: 2018-05-21 06:33:31
That was a long post ;)
All that said, for them as a company, it does make sense to optimize and it's not that hard at all. There are only 15,000~ BCH transactions a day, and the majority of their business is made up of BTC transactions.
It's not that hard to optimize. In layman's terms you hook up their network fee charge to a fee API such as Earn's. It's not very difficult.

So, please correct me if I'm wrong on this analogy: Is it essentially taking a grain of sand, throwing it onto Earth, and then having "God" shaking Earth with his hand crazily for 30 minutes, destroying everything and mixing up everything, and then trying to go back onto Earth and finding that particular grain of sand?
I know that might sound silly, but is that essentially the type of security that 12 word seed brings?

Did you just make this up? I just visited their website and they still have it. Here is a screen grab from 2 mins ago: 
Also true story....I almost bought some 2 months ago to test it out....but ultimately was swayed away because "one time" purchases are more expensive than subscription. Which, I understand, it just rubbed me the wrong way for some reason.
@_date: 2014-09-09 23:55:52
You do understand it's a protocol, correct? **ANY** business can build services built on top of the Blockchain. If one company fails, another will pick up the pace. It's the ultimate competition.
Can I say something in a respectful tone? If 2 years ago I told you PayPal would integrate Bitcoin into one of their companies, you (as you are right now) would laugh in my face or call me delusional. Would you agree?
Don't you think you're not having an open enough mind&gt;?

I spend because I save more money this way compared to if I used traditional methods. (I only buy things with BTC if they save me money or cost the same as traditional methods, usually save money)
I also spend to support the miners and support my investment stash by creating more liquidity in the market.

Nice try. People discuss what they like/enjoy all the time.

@_date: 2014-12-19 20:57:10
I don't believe that's an accurate assumption because if the block halves to 12.5 BTC, then they're making half as much, and BTC is still priced @ $315 so they have to pay for that electricity somehow...
@_date: 2018-05-16 14:32:40
That’s not a risk anymore with properly configured wallets.

a 25GB USB stick is like $10-$15. Then next year a 50GB USB stick will be $10-$15. Then the next year a 100GB USB stick will be $10-$15.

If there was ever a reason to buy Bitcoin, this is one. There are people that purposely try to hide good updates around Bitcoin or try to spread bad news.

In the most respectful way I've decided that I don't give a FUCK about any "regulations" put around Bitcoin.
If they are too restrictive then jobs will leave the state, and they'll be less competitive! 
I'm going to use Bitcoin the way I see fit because it was not created by the state of New York.

They ARE a business, put to work by the banks that forcibly keep their foothold at the top. Just like the federal reserve is a business. This is fact, it's not some conspiracy blog type stuff. 
You're missing the fact that I'm not worth their time, you need to learn how this stuff works. They can't get a good "return" out of me because I have nothing to give. I'm useless to them.
The main thing that you're failing to realize from this thread is that sooner or later they'll realize they need to re categorize Bitcoin. Such as "$5k" worth of purchases a year are exempt, useable as a currency" They don't have the manpower track transactions of millions of people and tying identities to it, it's insane.
The "event" you're referring to that would CAUSE them to look into you is doing something stupid, like not reporting a house, car, boat, business, etc etc with Bitcoin or any other currency. 
You're way too paranoid man, you need to learn how the real world works. You can't just believe that the IRS has some all mighty power and chances are will audit you and catch your sheets you bought on Overstock with Bitcoin.

It's a service that allows you to store "$50 worth of BTC" with them, and no matter what it's always $50 worth of BTC

I'm not dissing on their business. For all I know they're great or you might be right and they aren't good.
I just don't understand how companies are this bad at promoting themselves sometimes.
@_date: 2014-07-27 00:33:56
Yes, it's safe. It's safe for less than $500 worth of BTC in my opinion as long as you use two passwords and 2FA

I'm a Bitcoin enthusiast, but I think you're too optimistic. The scenario you're hoping for a year from now is still many years off, if ever.
@_date: 2014-09-29 23:20:35
I'm friends with Byrne over at BitReserve. They don't have altcoins, it's mainly like that to help people understand better. So you give them Bitcoin, they immediately sell it for Dollars, gives you 'BitDollars' in your account that are tied to a certain rate.
Then if you want to spend the BitDollars you do it the same as any other Bitcoin transaction (behind the scenes they are buying BTC with your dollars)
@_date: 2014-10-14 16:44:23
Correct answer: when everyday people can use Bitcoin in their everyday lives without even realizing or knowing how Bitcoin works.

In my opinion fees won't need to rise too much because of enough people not using centralized wallet services* (which results in off chain transactions and less fees for miners)
@_date: 2014-11-12 18:49:28
Interesting, very!

Yeah I gotta say. I know you're taking care of a family and you have more experience than me in that regard, but if you were really trying to save money then you should've at least opted for a Target Gyft card and got groceries.

Circle is just aiming to be that. Like if BitPay and Coinbase had sex and created some sort of super baby or something 
@_date: 2014-07-24 19:27:47
I'm not going to get fucked over because they follow a certain financial threshold, you don't know what you're talking about. 
Some guy making $30k a year isn't even worth their TIME.
For example did you know that when you purchase something on overstock you have to report that purchase at the end of the year on your taxes? NOBODY does this, it would be insane to do.
If I buy a house with Bitcoin someday, and report it, they're not going to say "Wow, this guy used Bitcoin, we have to go research all of his overstock purchases to see if he's cheating."
It doesn't even make sense. They go after the guys with the big bucks, that make it worth their time. They're a business.
@_date: 2014-07-25 23:40:24
Great, I recommend making a celebratory post in this sub reddit when you launch and update your website to explain what you do!

They are instant in practice when it comes to mass adoption, because 99% of USERS who use Bitcoin won't be worrying about moving Bitcoin to a Bitcoin Exchange like Bitfinex. They'll be using it on simple services like Circle, or remittance services where they don't even know they're using Bitcoin.

It's a stupid requirement and I'm guessing in due time they'll revisit the law. Just don't be stupid, report if you buy a car or house with BTC. 
I'm guessing most people who buy video games, electronics, food, etc with BTC have better things to worry about than keeping track of each purchase.

I don't understand why anybody would give companies like them any money. It's common sense. If one owns the mining equipment, then it's best to use it for your economic advantage to it's fullest capacity. 
If someone is willing to rent the mining equipment to you, then there's obviously a reason. It's because the equipment is outdated.

Can I give an opinion to you? I think your service will be much more successful/popular if you just eat the cost of transaction fees for all users. It'll be yet another incentive for people, enthusiasts and newcomers, to use your service.

The point that you're trying to make "No chargebacks doesn't add much value" doesn't hold ground.
9 times out of 10 people buy from trusted merchants online, and if the merchant messes up, they do right by the customer.
Chargebacks are mainly used by fraudsters and scammers. You never hear people say "Wow, newegg ripped me off, I'm glad I was able to get my money back from Visa."

It's going to be companies like Circle, Circle 2.0, Circle 3.0, etc etc
Your post IMO is too complicated.
If someone wants to hold their own keys in a secure manner then just use Blockchain.info. Use two complex passwords, use 2FA, PLUS use 2FA on the email address connected to the wallet.
It'll be good enough for 95% of people

Not really, if you have 20 Billion Bitcoin transactions a year (100 Million people doing 200 transactions a year) then you're looking at $1,000,000,000 a year in transaction fees (rewards) for the miners. That's in addition to any BTC chunks they get from completing blocks. They'll be fine.

It's not equally as safe. The network is much more prone to attacks than Bitcoin because of the lower power of miners behind it.
I predict that in due time cheap air will remove dogecoin as a payment method.
You're not going to see a company like Coinbase offer dogecoin on their site. It doesn't take itself seriously and businesses won't take it seriously either.

**I forgot the main reason this isn't going to work-anyone and their mom can create a new Bitcoin address in seconds. It's just going to be too confusing and hard to implement.**
"Sarah wants to spend some BTC, she then wants to move some funds in a new address so she's not 'carrying' so much. In doing so she forgot to create an address derived from a seed in her mobile electrum wallet, and instead makes a new electrum wallet. Now because of that Sarah, your next door neighbor, is spending black coins without even knowing it."
This whole idea is not able to be enforced, it's a nightmare even with an "API" and if any of it is tried it would just be ignored either purposely or unknowingly.
@_date: 2014-12-31 18:11:31
This is the easiest and best way in my opinion.
1. Use circle.com to acquire Bitcoin.
2. Use Breadwallet on iphone as your wallet. Send coins from Circle to this wallet.

@_date: 2014-08-08 15:34:58
There's nothing they need to do to 'prepare' other than recognize and build into their business plan that this will happen, and wait/see if the difficulty adjusts downwards when/if people leave the mining scene.

@_date: 2014-08-17 23:18:38
I'll just lay it out really simply, hopefully this will help you:
1. You pay using your wallet, sending to an address that BitPay says to pay to.
2. Bitpay will confirm that they received the payment (usually within 10-15 secs)
3. You don't worry about confirmations.
4. The "tax" you're speaking of is not on you, it's on the person sending the funds to Bitpay. It's not always 4%. If someone sends you $10, then they'll still only pay about 5 cents for a transaction fee.
If you want, ask others here more questions as well. It seems you went into this wanting to show your boss but you didn't understand everything that you're doing.

Do you have any idea what percentage of Credit Card transactions are insecure? It's MUCH higher than Bitcoin.
There's nothing wrong with trying, but if you're jumping on the DarkCoin train regarding this one then you don't understand two things:
1. Bitcoin network effect &amp; first mover advantage. (Also, I swear to God, don't you dare bring up the MySpace vs. Facebook analogy ;)
2. The ability of nodes seeing transactions to DRAMATICALLY lower the risk of someone trying to spend the same BTC twice.
Seriously think before you speak with your investment capital.

It costs 0% to accept Bitcoin and have it converted to USD. You are mistaken. If a company wants to they can buy a big corporate account with BitPay for $300/month.
Obviously they wouldn't redo the pumps now. They would install a tablet a register, @ $100 a pop.

You're not taking into consideration chargeback risk. They lose a significant amount to chargeback (places like Amazon). They could give 8% off to Bitcoin users and still always come out ahead.
@_date: 2014-07-18 15:43:47

I think their ultimate goal is the following: They'll partner which a BIG merchant, like Wal-Mart someday down the line, and offer financial services for them to some capacity. Then other merchants will follow.

But it's confusing because they say "if there are monthly fees". 
Why is it even an issue at all? They control the Bitcoin wallet, not the "3rd party". This is their company.
If it turns out there is a $5 monthly fee then they can just pay the 3rd party without you even needing to know. Why would your account get deducted when they can just pay the 3rd party directly?

Just stop worrying about it. Just be honest with yourself: are you really that worried about buying a $25 item with Bitcoin and then "they" come for you?
@_date: 2014-12-29 04:57:09
That's the way Bitcoin works (no chargebacks)
If a consumer wants chargebacks then they will have to use a Bitcoin wallet service that also does the payment processing for the merchant (or a Bitcoin wallet service that works in conjunction with the majors - BitPay, Coinbase, etc)

Since you're here I thought I'd report a small bug that I ran into.
I was trying to pay for something on CryptoThrift on my phone. I clicked on the QR code and Breadwallet opened fine. Then it prompted me to pay just like normal. I paid. I then went to look at the transaction on the transactions screen and it said something about double spend? Then the transaction cancelled out/and or disappeared from the transaction list. I was really confused. I then tried again and it worked.
Note that this was before the iOS update you put out a few days ago.

possible reasons:

2. Somebody doing it on principle for government/banking beliefs.
3. Somebody trying to keep money moving in and out of Bitcoin to help their separate "investment stash" of BTC to maintain or appreciate in value.

Pretty much it's where it takes more than one "key" or "password" to unlock a wallet if I understand it correctly. So you have a key, your friend has a key ... it can only be unlocked if you both use your keys together.

I don't believe in approaching things that way. You can be completely respectful and correct somebody.
He could've VERY easily said something to the effect of "Just want to clarify your statement: Bitcoin has never been hacked, it was actually an exchange service that had poor security measures. To this day Bitcoin's security is backed up by the same encryption that our modern day banking system uses."
@_date: 2014-07-24 23:04:29
Can I ask you a personal question. Are you REALLY going to report if you buy a $10 Target gift card? Say you some BTC worth $9, and it appreciates to $10, then buy the card. 
Are you really so worried that you're going to track the transaction on your return? When you're walking under trees do you look up because you're worried a squirrel will drop an acorn on your head or something? ;)

I agree with you that for the most part Purse.io will eventually die out as BTC becomes easier to obtain, that's for sure.
Literally today a site launched in the U.S. that allows you to buy BTC for close to Coinbase's price with a Credit Card, Trucoin.com
The bottom line though is Amazon eventually has to accept Bitcoin for survival in the next 5-10 years, and offer good discounts and rewards to those that do. Especially if they keep their wish list service. Decentralized Purse.io's built SPECIFICALLY for Fraud will come to fruition sooner or later.

You insulted me first. I made a perfect argument, you just aren't bright enough to understand it.
1. It does exist. See circle, they buy and sell Bitcoin at the same price as far as you're concerned.
2. I was just in a car accident, rattled and at home. TL;DR I know that you can already buy BTC directly. Just making sure people know that they'll still be able to do this.
@_date: 2014-09-22 16:48:29
I swear there must be all this pent up rage in the BTC price. One night someday I'll go to bed with the price @ $500, then the next morning I'll wake up to see it @ $1,500 which will prompt me to have a heart attack, orgasm, crap my pants, and die all at the same moment.

**When will users be able to buy items with Bitcoin without buying Bitcoin first? (aka in background you deduct from their checking)** 
1. You're logged into Coinbase wallet
2. You click to buy something online with Bitcoin
3. Coinbase deducts your bank account
Is this possible with certain amounts? One big step that a lot of people (like my sister) don't like is that they have to buy BTC first before making the purchase. It would be cool to eliminate that step.

This is about the silliest thing I've ever heard and you're mainly fear mongering. "If you don't send it back, you get punished"?????
How did you think of this stuff? If there's a trail of illegal money, and it gets deposited into your bank account, you're not just "wiped clean" if you immediately send it out. It's linked to you if they see fit for investigation.
Your whole premise is silly and gets a downvote from me. This won't work because businesses aren't going to turn away "black" coins. The black coins are also going to have the same exchange rate at that business as a white one.
This future you think of where the govt comes together on MASSIVE oversight is just a paranoid dream you're having right now. Do you realize how hard it is for them to get things right? Scandal after a scandal and fuck up after fuck up followed by lie after lie. It won't work. 
The main reason it won't work is people will just ignore the rules. "Oops I lost my coins" will be said over and over. Tying a new address to an identity will be incredibly difficult, they're better off just policing the traditional banking system 
@_date: 2014-08-19 02:07:57
I'm a Bitcoin enthusiast, but make up your damn mind.
If you want Dollars back then ask for dollars back.
If you want BTC back, then don't expect them to give you MORE BTC just because BTC depreciated. They don't "owe" you more than 1.8BTC, even if BTC fell to $10

Ben, some of this is ridiculous. You're gonna lose a hell of a lot of innovation in that state if you don't tone it down.
@_date: 2014-10-16 04:35:11
This is the stupidest thing ever. You conveniently left out all the steps to sign up for traditional payment method accounts.
Also you don't have to pay a fee to acquire BTC anymore, see Circle. They have the same buy/sell price.

One company doing good in return actually helps the other in my opinion.
@_date: 2014-09-28 23:31:43
Sorry you aren't too bright.
1. Why not use a credit card? Because BTC purchases will involve deeper discounts and you don't hand over financial information to the business. (Retailers will go to great lengths to avoid chargebacks)
2. I already know that Coinbase allows people to buy BTC straight. Just making sure people who this will still be an option. 
@_date: 2014-08-18 20:05:34
It kills me to see all these smart people trying to build alt-coins instead of good services on top of the BTC blockchain.

Okay thank you I'll look later 
@_date: 2014-09-02 16:00:29
I mainly use them for their Stevia based Sodas. Aspartame diet drinks give me headaches/blurred vision sometimes. I usually don't drink sugared sodas because I try to watch the calories.
The only downside to Stevia sodas are the prices! It usually works out to 75 cents to $1 per 12 oz can!
@_date: 2014-07-29 21:51:42
Last time I was surprised, went to check out and saw they added an additional 3% off on the coinbase payment site!
@_date: 2014-12-02 18:23:50
Yes! You can work with your BTC payment processor to decide how much of the donations you want to keep in BTC. For example you can keep 20% in BTC and have the other 80% converted to Dollars jn your bank account.
In my opinion it's good to at least consider keeping and using a portion in BTC. This can help the BTC economy by keeping funds moving about, and (potentially) create incentive for more people to donate to you via BTC.
@_date: 2014-11-13 20:38:09
Okay, thank you for the response. So you're thinking if anything, a discount would be offered for Bitcoin and not for cash as taking cash is more "work"?
@_date: 2014-11-27 16:24:12

I think more or less they're worried about jobs in NY, and how they'd miss out on an industry. Because if they aren't nice to BTC businesses, then someone else will be, and they (IMO) will be the new financial capital of the world. 
New Yorkers are going to use Bitcoin, if they want, no matter what.

I enjoy shopping at overstock. However I also know that they (sometimes) overcharge on items where it's hard to know what the real price should be-such as chairs, sheets, etc.
In that case i check prices on amazon and if it's cheaper there I buy it there. 
@_date: 2014-08-20 00:25:30
I really enjoyed it. Wasn't "epic" though.

The fine print doesn't say that.

This topic is common sense. Yet I still have people argue with me why "X" Altcoin will surpass Bitcoin. "But...but....faster block time!"

Or people can just migrate to Circle where there is no fee, ultimately forcing Coinbase to go the same route. (I've done 5 tests with Circle vs Coinbase on 5 different days at different times and Circle was always cheaper)
@_date: 2014-08-27 06:19:22
hmm, okay. thank you.
@_date: 2014-12-02 00:56:27
Thank you for the response.
I hope you know that a big move you need to do someday is being able to buy items with Bitcoin without the user manually purchasing Bitcoin first.
Of course this would require verified profiles, and maybe allow amounts only up to $100, but I see it as something very positive that you should do someday :)
@_date: 2014-08-14 01:32:42
Most people need to think forward. WE are early adopters. There are pros and cons to that.
One con, at the moment, is that there are many varied 'prices' for BTC around the world. As time passes and BTC grows that gap will become smaller.
@_date: 2014-07-29 21:50:34
I'd never recommend someone nowadays uses a "desktop wallet"
Only if they're making a significant investment in Bitcoin would I try to educate them on offline wallets. 
For most people, online wallets are enough as long as they use 2FA on the wallet as well as 2FA on the email address tied to the wallet.
@_date: 2014-12-31 21:26:37
@_date: 2014-09-22 18:56:24
No, you can't send from those others you listed legally.
@_date: 2014-12-22 23:07:43
there is no minimum. You just select "other" and type in the amount you wish to donate.
@_date: 2014-10-01 15:19:53
@_date: 2014-12-01 18:56:07
I have similar experiences. They are sincere yet their site is clumsy. 
They had a site bug which resulted in the card's I ordered not being processed. I was busy, and checked a couple days later to see I didn't get them. I then called and said "hey, I didn't get them", he knew I paid with Bitcoin and he said "there was a bug, however the refund should've been sent back to you".
I responded really quickly and politely saying that Refunds should never be automatically send with BTC. They should ask which address to send it to first. He was receptive and luckily he was mistaken, no refund was sent out.
So yes, a sincere and good company but at the same time they're going through learning/growing pains.

That's true. At 'the beginning' I would tell anyone about Bitcoin who would spare me a second. Now I only reach out to someone if there's something Bitcoin can help them with, or I share via Social Media if there's big news in the sector (Microsoft accepting Bitcoin, etc etc)
@_date: 2014-08-01 00:36:13
Wish the company well.
I know there are people that will/do use their machines but I'd rather link a bank account to Coinbase/Circle and acquire/sell my BTC for 1% fee or less.
@_date: 2014-10-14 16:22:33
That brings some perspective, thank you. Maybe I'm just jaded and those points you brought up didn't phase me.
@_date: 2014-09-26 17:24:57
Also, I don't know about you, but when I used to buy online with a Credit Card I'd only do it with trusted merchants. You know what I mean?
I've never googled "buy playstation game" and then click on the 12th page of google results for the store to buy from. I always use stores I know and trust are legit such as Amazon, Newegg, Overstock, etc

Exactly. In a "silly" way I agree with you.
My net worth would be MUCH less if I listened to this guy and because of that I just despise him. Mainly because of the way he presents himself, and if something goes his way for 1 day he posts "I told you so!"
@_date: 2014-09-29 21:02:36
Yes, I told them eventually they should partner with one of the bigger companies (Coinbase/Circle) try to offer it

Do you think I don't realize this?
@_date: 2014-08-08 03:42:23
My honest answer:
Electrum is best for storing "savings" in Bitcoin as you can do it offline for maximum security.
If you're just going to be using Bitcoin for everyday transactions and amounts smaller than a few thousand $'s worth then I recommend Blockchain.info wallet. If you use two great passwords, plus two factor authentication, PLUS two factor authentication on the email account that's tied to your blockchain wallet, you're very safe.

Thank you. What are the fees associated with the 3rd party? Do they set the fee themselves?
I for example love CryptoThrift. I have only bought and have been saved many times because the site owners covered me with their 1% escrow fee.

One thing I'll say is try to do a better job vetting which businesses are legit or not. Some people got scammed big time last year because anybody who submitted to it seems to have gotten on the BitcoinBlackFriday site, and not every "store" was legit.
That being said thank you for putting this together!

2. If I see one more casascius coin... !
@_date: 2014-11-30 02:58:22
Every system is abused, what's new? Additionally Purse.io is designed in that new users are only allowed to buy $50 worth of BTC with a credit card at first, then a little more, then a little more. It's not like right off the bat they let people buy $3,000 worth of BTC on a credit card. They do it little by little to help detect fraud.
In the meantime Purse.io will become more and more irrelevant with each passing month as acquiring BTC becomes easier and easier throughout the world.
@_date: 2014-12-24 20:28:25

You're most likely trying to buy something that Newegg isn't selling Directly on their site. To some vendors they're like a directory service, listing their products for them for a fee, and those don't accept BTC yet.
@_date: 2014-09-08 03:28:53
@_date: 2014-12-19 21:09:46
I phrased my question wrong, forgive me. Here is what I'm trying to get at:  Unless I'm mistaken the miner's do have a say what the fee is, right? What if the biggest pools all contacted each other and said "Alright, if people want their transactions included in the next block then they have to attach a 25cent fee."
In that scenario what say do you and I have in the matter? 
@_date: 2014-12-29 04:54:31
I also want to point one more thing out. Microsoft, as you know, accepts Bitcoin for some of their products. They are the second biggest company in the world. No, they are not a perfect company.
But I think that should give you pause, and possible reconsideration, of your stance. They are obviously seeing something you are not. Whether or not they are seeing something that will be a positive someday can only be told in time.

How are reporters THIS ignorant? Do they ever do their research? I mean, c'mon...they listed Target and Amazon as accepting Bitcoin for crying out loud. 
@_date: 2014-07-16 04:14:25
They can take legal action all they want but they don't have a case that will hold up. They could say "but uh Purse is ripping us off" and Purse would point out that it's users aren't any more fraud like percentage wise than the normal people Amazon deals with. Plus with Purse's 'vip' program they're eliminating that risk even more.
To top it all off, if they went after Purse.io then a Decentralized Purse.io would be created by someone else. There's literally nothing Amazon could say about it.
The only thing Amazon can and will do is continue their business plan that deals with fraud on a daily basis. Fraud is already built into their bottom line, they know how to deal with it and they know how often they get ripped off.
@_date: 2014-11-27 16:05:37
It's a way to buy Bitcoin from anywhere in the world with a credit card. That comes with fees, because they're in high demand.

If you're such a professional, then what is your opinion on the following:
"In 5-6 years 10s of Millions of people are going to be using Bitcoin for purchases on Overstock,Amazon, Dell, just to name a few. You don't expect them to reclassify Bitcoin by law compared to how it is now? You HONESTLY believe the IRS is going to expect everyone to keep track of the purchases they make all year?"

Your warning doesn't matter, because once services like 'Circle' become mainstream, 10s of Millions of people aren't going to report their Dell.com purchases (whether intentionally or unknowingly)

It won't be an issue because when/if it becomes mainstream for merchants most of them won't be using wallets/payment systems that says "0 confirmations" on the payment screen. It will just say "paid" when someone pays the invoice at register.
Now if someone wants to use something like "blockchain merchant app" at their small local business then sure, they'll see confirmations. 
Please think forward and into the future on these things.

This is why TruCoin(the new BTC buy service using Credit Cards)  MAKES you verify two small transactions they make into your checking account of the same name as your Credit Card. That's how they verify it.

Bitcoin's security (hash power) surpasses it many times. Additionally, the "faster confirmation times" of Litecoin in the grand scheme of things mean nothing as we continue to have advancements of seeing transactions propagate across the network:

Thx for the reply. I was just a little confused because I wasn't trying to cheat anyone or do anything bad, so when I saw that message I wondered if the wallet accidentally tried to send the payment twice on accident? It appears that's not the case.
I could see this really confusing people though. Maybe don't allow the wallet to proceed with trying to send funds unless it's synced? Would that be a good workaround?
You're the expert, not me ;) I just love this wallet and if I introduce it to a non-techie I don't want little things like this to sway them from Bitcoin.

I just threw a number out there that would be eye catching to consumers. They roll up to a gas station, see it costs $3.50 with a credit card, $3.15 if paying with Bitcoin.
My question is: is that much of a discount worth it to gas stations when you factor in credit card fees + the cost of chargebacks on your business?

If you lose your phone you don't lose your wallet. 
The wallet is protected by a 4 digit code. Also each wallet has a 12 word "key" that let's you recreate the wallet on another phone. Upon creating your wallet you write down that key.

So the way it works is you send BTC, two hours later you get walmart egift card that's a PDF, then you go to walmart and exchange the PDF for a physical card.  
It's not as convenient as Gyft but you have higher discounts, plus if you buy over $500 worth at once you use code "BULK" and get an extra 2% off 
@_date: 2014-09-19 15:50:00
Your "arguments' don't make any sense! I know more about Bitcoin than I wish to know to be honest, and I've read that DarkCoin PDF already, it's not "enough" to move investment capital from Bitcoin to Darkcoin.
1. You bring up insured credit card purchases?! That wasn't even part of the debate. Learn to think logically.
2. This is totally about trying to convince people on the darkcoin train, and you know it.
3. You need to stop being a prick.

@_date: 2014-08-08 19:04:15
Of course Blockchain isn't as secure on an offline computer with Electrum, but you can carry/use blockchain.info on your phone.
I said from the very beginning that electrum is for savings.
In fact I'd say blockchain.info wallet is more secure than electrum on a machine that is connected to the internet because of keylogger a/malware. 2 strong passwords, 2Fa, and 2fa on email connected to blockchain make it very secure for the majority of people.
@_date: 2014-11-30 01:18:08
Purse.io is great but with each passing month it gets easier and easier to acquire BTC throughout the world. Like you said, this will ultimately in the long run result in lower discounts when using Purse.io

Good job guys!
Any chance on bringing back 6% rewards??
Even if you upped it to a constant 5% for Bitcoiners I'm sure many people would question their Gyft 'loyalty' and switch over :)
(P.S. I love you guys at Gyft if you're reading this! But I love competition too :)
**Edit**: Can I add some kind words of encouragement, Egifter? I've called your support line about twice regarding random questions, and both times I called a gentleman answered the phone (sorry I didn't catch his name). I would always get the feeling that he just wasn't excited to speak with me, like he was really ready for the conversation to be over. He wasn't rude per se, but I never like when I feel like I'm more polite than the customer service person that I'm speaking to on the phone, ya know? Granted, this was months ago, it might be resolved now. This is really the only thing I feel Gyft has done better than you guys in my sincere opinion. Everytime I call Gyft I'm usually forwarded to Krystle, and she just sounds like she legitimately enjoys helping me resolve the problem, that I'm not just another number. I really appreciate that.
I say this all with respect. I can't even imagine the challenges of running a company like Egifter. Thanks for reading.

Honestly I think (and I don't have numbers to back this up) that chargebacks related to respected and legit companies are usually people trying to rip off the company.

They are instant in practice.
When there's Bitcoin "mass adoptance" people trying to double spend the same BTC will be just as common as someone bringing a cointerfeit $20 bill into a store.
When it comes to BitFinex... big whoopdi-do! You had to wait a whole hour and a half?! The pain. Try going back to where we were a decade ago.
Bitcoin has enough first mover advantage and network effect to not worry about "an hour wait on a Bitcoin exchange"

Never underestimate technology coupled with greed. Businesses are NOT happy with fees associated with Credit Cards.

I commend this blog post at the same time I'm confused by: "IF you're charged a monthly fee, we'll reimburse you."
What's the point in that? Do they not know if there will be a monthly fee for sure? If there is a monthly fee, and they want it to be free for their users, then they should just pay it behind the scenes, and not have users wonder if/when their BTC will be withdrawn for $5 and if/when they'll get reimbursed.
Confusing to me.

You can buy them on phone or in web browser.
You buy each card separately for each merchant, just paying with your Bitcoin wallet.
It's really easy. 
@_date: 2014-07-24 22:55:28
Even CNNMoney News reports on the issue say this 'ruling' by the IRS is stupid and nobody is going to follow it.
Have some dignity man, don't report your $10 Target Gift card you bought with Bitcoin to the IRS. I'm serious. .... it's just pathetic if someone is scared to the point of doing such a thing.

What are your thoughts on raising the block size/fitting more transactions into blocks when it's needed? Do you think rational miners will adjust/accept the fork as easily as Gavin Andresen says so?
(My opinion: a rational miner would accept the fork. if they don't then Bitcoin can't continue to grow as their profits will continue to go down as more transactions move off-chain and the block reward gets smaller and smaller)
@_date: 2014-08-01 15:13:52

You're going to see major wallets (Coinbase, Circle, etc) offer incentives to consumers real quick, you'll see. Partnerships they will make with Merchants. Because, like you agreed to, merchants do want to accept Bitcoin, even if they don't realize it yet.
You're talking about a very small part of Bitcoin though. U.S. consumer shopping via Bitcoin is the most boring aspect of Bitcoin.

It's super easy. You order online, select payment as "cash", wait a few minutes, and call the store and tell them to pay for the order with your gift cards and read off the numbers to them. 
@_date: 2014-12-05 22:28:18
It's just a way, in my opinion, to have more of a voice in our world. For example (as you know) the Federal Reserve isn't even a part of the U.S. government. It just "exists" because a lot of rich guys decades ago decided that they wanted to. They set all these policies that really have big effects on our lives which we have no say in (as a U.S. Dollar user)
(for the record I did not downvote you)

Sorry, do some research on web procedures and how they're handled before you comment,
Look @ facebook's API, anyone can plug into it and if a user agrees then certain details are available to the application. The only way it can be stopped is if it's breaking laws by collecting data and doing illegal things with it on the behalf of the app creator.
People steal with credit cards everyday. There's nothing amazon can do about it.
Heck, overstock could create a "import amazon wish list" feature with them matching or lowering prices and there's nothing amazon could do about it.

I see it as more of a calculated risk.
If I put $1000 on Red in Roulette then I have approximately a 45-48% chance that I'll double my money.
In terms of Bitcoin, I feel that everyday the network runs without 'crashing' that the risk goes down. I also recognize that anybody can create anything they want that utilizes the Bitcoin network, and I'm betting that several people will create killer apps for it.
I would not feel comfortable putting funds in something that is like Bitcoin, but closed source and dependent on one company succeeding.

Additionally Mr E there will and are "Circle" like services being built that are just like circle, but have the option to remove volatility while you're in the "Circle" ecosystem.
So you transfer value to your "Circle" account, you then have the option to lock in the value at the current exchange rate, or choose to have it free floating.

A. Accepts BTC through payment processor, no need to wait. 
B. Accepts BTC through off chain transaction, no need to wait.

Good thinking. Now once you start using Circle it will be even better! (I've done several tests, at the exact same time, on different days, and Circle has always been cheaper for purchasing BTC!)
Also, try CardFlip.com! They have many gift cards at better discounts than Gyft. The only negatives to CardFlip: there isn't an app, E-Cards are emailed to you, and ECard purchases aren't instant, they generally take 2ish hours from the moment you send the BTC payment.
@_date: 2014-12-31 02:13:29
I agree that $5 and up tips make the most sense. 
Don't know why you had to type so much though :)
@_date: 2014-12-28 21:12:31

@_date: 2014-07-18 16:39:27
The thing is though, they don't have any jurisdiction over the Bitcoin network. They also don't have jurisdiction over what a business decides to accept for money. McDonalds in Texas can choose to accept Euros only if they wanted to, and there's nothing they can do about it. 
**The most important part though, is "they" (and by they I mean those in charge) want peace as much as possible, they don't want their boat rocked. If they make it harder for all these big businesses to make a profit, then more people will be poorer and jobless, therefore giving them more of a reason to protest and create trouble. Think of Dell.com. They just began accepting BTC today. If the government dropped all these regulations on what BTC addresses could send to Dell then Dell would be VERY unhappy as they are a massive company and just want to turn a profit. They don't give a fuck if some BTC before reaching them was used to buy Weed, just like they don't care this about Dollars.**
The scenario is not plausible. The U.S. needs every instance to be competitive because of a declining empire (U.S. Dollar) and they need Bitcoin for tax revenue. They'll merely do it the old fashioned way: property taxes, energy taxes, car taxes, etc etc, watching for big purchases tied to your name such as a house that's beyond your income range, a 250K car that doesn't match your income range, they have their means of collecting taxes that already works.

I just don't understand the business decision. Nobody is buying Dogecoin for commerce. It's a "fun" coin for message boards. Nobody looks at it as a business coin.
The reason GoCoin implemented dogecoin into the processing services is because they're trying to gain market share compared to BitPay, but aren't smart enough to come up with better ideas.
@_date: 2014-07-15 04:00:40
@_date: 2014-09-22 20:56:42
Thank you for the response. My main concern is miners surviving. I'm sure most of them know what they're doing, but I'd hate to see them "fail" and the BTC network fail because they wouldn't agree to a block size increase, hence not allowing more transactions and making it not economical to mine as block rewards decrease.
Maybe I shouldn't worry and this is akin to worrying if a grown man will stick his hand in a fire? (Which isn't very likely)
@_date: 2014-09-04 04:21:03
It's not worth it to confuse consumers. Dogecoin is a parody coin, not intended for true commerce. It doesn't offer anything substantial over Bitcoin and purchases with dogecoin on their site are going to be VERY few. I say all this with respect.

Opposite opinion, and I promise I'm not exaggerating:
I've initiated 50-75 separate buys of ALLL sorts on different market situations (BTC crashing, BTC rising) ever since Coinbase launched, and I've never had a purchase cancelled.
This ranges from $10 worth of BTC all the way to $50k of BTC.
I promise I'm being sincere.

@_date: 2014-09-19 22:23:10
As far as I know (from my tests) it's a legit business. They have average ratings if you search online. 
Additionally (and I could be mistaken regarding this) I believe once you transfer a balance from the egiftcard to a physical card at Wal-Mart, if anyone has the original egiftcard number/pin it doesn't matter because that balance is now gone.
Edit: the business has a 45 day warranty on the cards if anything goes wrong from what I see now.

I just want to make sure you know that Bitcoin isn't going to just "go away" unless there's a very significant security vulnerability found in the protocol.
There are too many possibilities for different services worldwide that can be built on top of the Blockchain. This isn't like a service that one company has created. This is a protocol that anyone in the world can build a service on if they have the technical knowledge.
$4.5 Billion market cap is chump change.
Respectfully I really feel like you will regret your decision.
@_date: 2014-07-29 16:44:22
Yeah as of now the only way (on iOS) I can resolve this is to delete the wallet I don't want to open.
I would try deleting both wallets, to see if I could re-install them and test if it defaults to the last one installed, but I like using CoinJar's app and it's not available for download in the U.S. right now.
@_date: 2014-07-24 19:39:32
Yep. Thanks for pointing out, that's my point. The government will adapt and find ways to tax, and petty Bitcoin transactions for video games bought online won't be a means of taxation (except for sales tax on the item, of course)

The one "decision" I'll never understand by the person in charge of that site is to release the details of the deals so late. It doesn't give most people new to Bitcoin the chance to research BTC just a little bit, create a wallet, go through the process of acquiring BTC from Circle &amp; Coinbase, etc. etc.
It was just a stupid decision. They should've released the news of the deals this Monday morning at the LATEST.
@_date: 2014-10-19 13:59:00
This is the way I put it:
When is the last time you bought from a business that you don't trust? Do you google "buy videogame" and then decide to buy from a site on the 50th page of google results? No, you buy from stores you trust like Amazon.

I will use the iPhone 5s until there's a significant reason to upgrade when it comes to Virtual Reality - I'm a VR enthusiast, and I'm purchasing a Note 4 + Gear VR strictly for the purpose of VR, I won't be using it for calls)
That being said I agree. I understand WHY Apple is doing 'ApplePay' but honestly it does nothing to improve fees &amp; overall useability of transferring value over the internet.
I wouldn't lose sleep over it though. As you know PayPal just announced BTC integration. Travel back in time 2 years and try to tell your friends/family that. You'd be laughed out of the house :)

I'm all for governments having funds to operate the needs that actually help people, but they're going to have to be smarter about it.
There's no way that example you put out would result in flags being raised by the IRS unless you were already being watched for something else and they were REALLY trying to get you. How on Earth are they going to track those groceries you're buying? They can't.

Good thinking on your behalf. There's nothing "wrong" with Dogecoin per se but it doesn't have first mover advantage and it doesn't offer anything substantial over Bitcoin. 
At the moment it only has a $15 million market cap, it doesn't look very appealing.

Do you know how purse works? It allows people to buy BTC for a premium by purchasing people's amazon wish lists for them.
Alternatively if you want to buy an item for BTC then you can put up your amazon wishlist and see if there are any takers, the bigger the discount the longer it takes the order to fill. 5-10% usually take 1 to 2 days. 25% takes about a week. 
It doesn't matter if the company is huge or small, it makes no difference on the discount offered.

If someones pays capital gains on a LARGE purchase with Bitcoin, they are a smart individual. If they take the time to actually track and/or hire a CPA to compile your Gyft and Overstock Bitcoin purchases, then he/she is a paranoid idiot who doesn't value the very little time they get on this Earth.

That's not the case. Breadwallet has adequate enough fees and you can't turn fees off. 
@_date: 2014-12-19 21:05:38
I'm sorry if I'm asking the question incorrectly. Unless I'm mistaken the miner's do have a say what the fee is, right? What if the biggest pools all contacted each other and said "Alright, if people want their transactions included in the next block then they have to attach a 25cent fee."
In that scenario what say do you and I have in the matter? We wouldn't, correct? We would have to attach 25 cents or have to wait longer

In my honest opinion when it comes to developed countries these are the only ways for Bitcoin to be accepted:
1. Massive savings when paying with Bitcoin
2. Necessity because of severe problems with their go to currency. 
@_date: 2014-12-02 00:18:51
Hopefully this is a build up to someday allowing their users to purchase items with Bitcoin without owning Bitcoin.
1. User buys $100 item from Overstock using Bitcoin and their coinbase wallet
2. Coinbase deducts $100 from your checking
Thus eliminating the need to "buy BTC" before purchasing something with Bitcoin. 
Curious of a technical question: can coinbase quickly, in a second, look at the balance of your checking if you give them permission to do so? Is this possible to do so?
@_date: 2014-09-30 15:51:08
My math does add up. It doesn't have to be places like Amazon specifically.
A business (when they understand Bitcoin) would rather have a customer pay with Bitcoin and give them 5% off then that same customer use a credit card with no discount, because that's how much it's worth it to them to have no chargeback risk.

What's the reasoning for not just earning BTC directly?
@_date: 2014-10-14 22:59:53
It doesn't matter what they say. With Bitcoin you can go "on vacation" somewhere else in the world, memorize a brain wallet, and start a new life in a new place with your funds.
That's pretty powerful. I'm not saying this is something that will happen all the time, just it's powerful that this is possible.
@_date: 2014-07-17 00:12:17
What do you mean? Of course you can send BTC out of your Circle account to any address.

@_date: 2014-09-24 20:43:10
Can I make a recommendation? (Just a suggestion, maybe you'll like it)
It would be nice if there was a constant discount with Bitcoin compared to if you paid with a credit card, kinda like how Gyft constantly discounts Bitcoin payments more.
Then, orders over $500 with Bitcoin warrant an additional discount on top of that.
Just an idea! I think it's why so many likeGyft/EGifter. Bitcoiners never have to worry if there's an incentive for them to use Bitcoin over credit card, cause there always is! :)
@_date: 2014-10-15 05:55:06

Lol, this is what happens when you have 'smart' people trying to fix problems that don't exist.
Bitcoin transactions ARE instant. 99% of the time they are secure enough the moment the coins enter the payment address.  If a merchant wants some extra peace of mind then they use a payment processor or wait for 1 confirmation.
@_date: 2014-12-04 18:24:17

So in a sense, if you don't mind answering, is he kinda starting out like Blockchain.info did?
Blockchain said "We don't have access to your keys for spending, never will" and over time people began to trust them as that proved to be true.

That's true regarding the generation, but it's honestly a Blockchain.info issue when we get down to it, they don't take security seriously. Can you please scroll in this thread and read the big bugs I found in their iOS apps last year, which even resulted in the CEO writing me to say thanks.
I'm biased, I love Breadwallet. I even contributed some to their seed round. I would never invest in Blockchain now, they don't take the security of my money seriously enough.

It makes you question how they handle things if they say BEFOREHAND that there will be no fees outside of the $15, and then after-hand it proves to not be true.
So either they company was unorganized in terms of the PR department, they flat out lied, or they didn't know what they're getting into. My guess is not organized or not knowing what there getting into.

If you wish, there is the website to look at it. It's only on iOS I believe. If you scroll down to the bottom you'll see there is a pic there with two phones side by side, different screens.

While I agree this is huge I hope that their team can once again make their phone apps desirable again.

How is Bitcoin supposed to scale then if we don't raise the block size to help fund the miners when block rewards halve? 
I understand what you mean by fork though. However as far as we're concerned it's still the same Bitcoin if 90% of miners agree to a fork where the only change is raising the block size, correct?

They prefer people to pay in Bitcoin (even if they don't realize it yet) because of:
1. 0% to 1% fees.
2. No chargebacks.
3. The funds (BTC) in their account immediately, or the funds (USD) in their bank accounts the very next day.
4. Once I got over the learning curve of Bitcoin, it truly is easier than using a Credit Card. You just scan their pre-made QR code and send the payment to them. When I'm online I don't have to type in any numbers and have no risk of my financial information being stolen. When I'm in a physical store the payment is just as fast as me paying with my physical credit card (as long as the employee is trained on what to do)
These are the early days.

It can allow is and it HAS to in order for Bitcoin to survive. 
As the block reward lowers the miners will need more transaction fees to survive.

@_date: 2014-09-03 23:05:22
For some reason I'm not worried if it'll work or not. They're a legit company as far as I can tell, I even tried calling them and thanked them for taking Bitcoin. I told them they unknowingly cornered a huge market at the moment in the U.S. as there's no way to buy Gasoline with Bitcoin unless you want to pay a 10% fee (Coinfueled) Additionally they check out on google searches and are mentioned on other reputable sites (GiftCardGranny) and they have average reviews.
I don't expect it to work at the pump. I will go exchange the e-giftcard for a physical card that can be used at the pump. Additionally each gallon is 3 cents cheaper when you use a Wal Mart Giftcard!
@_date: 2014-12-08 17:59:48
Yeah, I'm not highly "technical" but I'm very "techie" for example.

Hi Peter,
Just wanted to say thanks for all you and the other guys do. There's a lot of businesses that are built/being built on the Bitcoin blockchain which appreciate you guys tackling the big questions.
I think most Bitcoiners can agree that they wish for Bitcoin to continue to feel like a place where investment can be made. (both in the currency and businesses that use the currency)
On a personal level which I believe makes sense, I wish for transactions in number to have the ability to rise while not having to significantly compete against others to get into the next block or so. The way of getting to that goal is going to be determined by men much smarter than me in the way of coding skills.

"Fade away"?
She must not understand the following: mining difficulty can decrease if needed, if people wish there are/will be services tying Bitcoin to a particular exchange rate, and since there is an economic incentive to grow the network-miners will include more transactions in bigger blocks.

As you can probably guess I'm not an engineer. But like I was saying, my "street smarts" tell me this particular aspect regarding upload speeds isn't something to worry about. Can you please in simple terms explain to me why it's a concern? I'm being sincere in saying that I JUST look at my provider's plans and for $75/month I can upload even faster at 2 megabytes a second.
Those are the data points I'm looking at and it's telling me not to worry about upload speeds.
@_date: 2015-05-06 16:22:56
Personally I don't mind that.  I need 2FA to get into my account and that's okay with me :)

Why don't you understand that if Bitcoin is to go mainstream then there needs to be options where people aren't "responsible" for their Bitcoin?
That's why there are options like Circle and Xapo coming to light. (Xapo has squashed the rumors of no matter how much you have in BTC with them, "only $100" is covered)
Bringing 2FA into the picture DRAMATICALLY reduces the risk for these companies.
@_date: 2014-09-05 17:17:01
You essentially said the right things but I'll share what I say to newcomers. Let's say I'm talking with "John"
John: What is Bitcoin?
Me: Okay, so it's actually really interesting. Let's say before Bitcoin there was 'JohnCoin'. If you sent me some JohnCoins, then I had to trust YOU, and trust that you did not counterfeit the JohnCoins. As you can imagine, this was very problematic. Bitcoin solved this problem. If somebody sends you Bitcoin then you KNOW it's NOT counterfeit because every transaction is verified on the decentralized network that all runs on the same code. Now, no matter who sends Bitcoin to whom, it is guaranteed legitimate because there is no trust involved. The open source code is built in a way where no trust is needed.

In my opinion I think it is something that is needed because user adoption can sneak up on us just like that, and is predicted to following current trends, and it would be horrible for the network to be crippled with delays because we were concerned about things that aren't really problems. (run on sentence)
For example internet speeds. I'm some average dude and for $75/month I can have an internet speed that uploads at 2 MegaBYTES a second and downloads @ 30MegaBytes/second. People keep bringing that one worry up but it's not even a concern.
@_date: 2015-05-04 15:08:18
I used to think I want one now I don't care. If I'm going to spend BTC I'm going to spend it (spend $100+ worth a week)
I have no desire to have a debit card that pulls from my BTC balance, personally. 
@_date: 2017-02-17 01:48:44
I could see that, thanks for replying 
I think though a solution can be worked out. I'm not saying they should do this obviously, but heck, an iOS/android wallet that uses hardware level encryption still hasn't had Bitcoins stolen to this date.
Not saying that's what they'll do, but I just wanted to point out that secure solutions can be created. 
@_date: 2017-02-15 00:16:59
In the technical sense of being on a device that isn't connected to the internet, no.
However to this date there hasn't been any funds stolen from a breadwallet.
@_date: 2014-11-15 01:52:15
Wow! Holy fuck
@_date: 2014-07-24 22:57:16
They're not going to do that, because it will cost jobs and they need JUSSST enough innovation/jobs to keep the masses from rioting in the streets. Think like a logical human being.
I don't think you understand that when Dell.com (a $60 billion dollar company) began accepting there is no turning back. It's going to keep expanding.
@_date: 2017-02-22 17:43:36
I'm just one person and I've sent 3 transactions in the past 16 hrs. Legit, commerce transactions.
Not moving BTC for the sake of moving them
@_date: 2014-09-18 01:10:10
It's because it's 'newer' and since RingPlus rents the Sprint towers, it's part of their agreement (so the newest and best phones are with Sprint)
It'll be un blacklisted in about 3-6 months.
Sprint has been great! Sometimes spotty connection but when I'm on RingPlus for $40 month I'll be fine!

use breadwallet on android/ios.
it has hardware level encryption, protecting your Bitcoin from malware. that's something your desktop and Jaxx can't do.
@_date: 2017-02-23 22:18:12
Mining is a major business now, with costs in the $10s of millions of dollars for hardware to have a small operation.

This. I will NEVER use Coinbase for a day to day wallet as I ran into this issue. I can only hope that when the 'masses' start jumping into BTC they have this issue resolved. It's been over a year now.

That might be fine to you but I have a significant financial investment into Bitcoin and the Blockchain. I don't have time to deal with a market panic and sell off just because we didn't raise the block size.

I only downvoted you because it's not an android issue. Secure wallets will be coming this year which utilize Rivetz, which essentially stores the private keys on a different "partition" of the phone's storage, and makes the app in a "sandbox" of sorts like IOS.
@_date: 2017-02-03 03:43:10

@_date: 2015-05-29 07:44:02
Blockchain.info is a disaster. Just use Breadwallet (I think android version is coming soon which is just as secure as iOS, using Rivetz technology)
@_date: 2015-05-28 23:19:06
I wish Blockchain.info the best in their endeavors, and I hope people have positive experiences with future iterations of their app.

The few physical locations who accept it probably did so thinking they were onto "the next big trend" and not really knowing what they're getting into. It's my personal prediction that we won't see a big uptick in physical locations accepting for many many years after the majority of online sites accept BTC.
It's also my personal belief that BTC isn't going to go away. It truly is remarkable technology and out of 7 billion people there will be many that find use for it. It's not trying to replace credit cards or traditional checking accounts, it is it's own category :)
@_date: 2015-05-06 03:32:49
Like I just mentioned to Todd:
TL;DR You're smarter than me on "tech" stuff most likely, but in my gut I feel it's not a concern. For $10-$15 more a month I can upload 1 megabyte a second, and I'm just some normal guy.
In my opinion I wouldn't worry about upload speeds. Focus on some of the more pressing issues.
@_date: 2014-10-07 04:01:52
Why on earth would this be downvoted? In July and August there were 2 big bugs in the iOS app in two different versions back to back:
1st: when choosing to denominate wallet in "bits", if you clicked to pay a BitPay invoice then the wallet accidentally sent the wrong amount of BTC for payment.
2nd: when clicking to pay a BitPay invoice, the Blockchain app would open but not carry over the payment amount. It would only carry over the address you're paying to, and you had to go back and copy and paste the amount of BTC that needed to be paid if you wanted to complete the payment.
@_date: 2015-05-06 16:13:52
...you do know that one can limit in their router settings how much they dedicate to uploading, correct?
It's not going to be an issue, you're stressed about nothing. Consumers aren't ever going to "set up nodes". I've helped fund a startup and we're already planning to deploy nodes because we're not going to be counting on others to do it for us.

The most secure wallet (that doesn't require external hardware and is easy to use) is breadwallet (iOS/android). It uses hardware level encryption, something your laptop doesn't offer. This protects your Bitcoin against viruses/malware, and your Bitcoin is safe.
If you want to go nuts though you can buy a dedicated hardware wallet.
@_date: 2017-02-24 17:15:34
There's no approval day. They have until March 11th to deny it. 
@_date: 2017-02-08 04:36:25
breadwallet is on android too, and by default it uses hardware level encryption (which protects your Bitcoin from malware)
@_date: 2015-05-23 17:25:21
I appreciate your thoughts on this. I just think that if a user wants those options then Breadwallet won't be the choice for them. (Bitcoin can be confusing enough as it is)
I think they're aiming to make choices that will please the highest number of people in the best way. I'm not very technical but I believe that way (someday) will involve some sort of "trend tracking" where fees are calculated by research of past transactions that get into blocks and what fees went into the calculation.
@_date: 2015-05-29 16:49:28
I'm not gonna make a transaction just for the heck of it but I did make a purchase today with Bitcoin, so that's my contribution :)

Breadwallet is the best choice.

Yes, you can start a new one to remove the old one 
@_date: 2017-02-28 22:18:29
There's just a lot of network activity at the moment. In my opinion use wallets that more accurately determine fees for you, such as breadwallet.
@_date: 2014-07-16 20:51:23
It's sad that this PR doesn't have more upvotes. This is the first cell carrier in the US to accept Bitcoin and nobody is blinking an eye.

I'm pro-Bitcoin but this is not related to Bitcoin in any way. At the moment if Amazon accepted Bitcoin it would only help with miniscule millions to their bottom line.

Hi Spotted,
I would try calling again. The key for me (in customer support situations) is making sure the person on the phone knows I'm upset, but NOT upset at them personally. It has worked every single time when I'm in the right and I need something fixed. I would try again.
The last resort is if they don't budge then I ask "Can you explain how "XXX" makes sense? How does "XXX" make sense?" They never can explain how they're in the right in the two situations I used that and the company did me right. I would try again.

In a way, yes. For example someone might see a new building pop up that's advertises "send up to $5,000 to India for 3% fee!"

3. With that being said someday we'll see 100MB block size, maybe decades. That's 60,000,000 transactions a day.
4. A transaction doesn't need a confirmation for a business/payment processor to determine the probability of it being legit. With the help of nodes determining how far a transaction had progressed a company can assess it's risk.

Not literally "insane", but ignorant people make judgements on something without knowing all the facts.
I just want to make sure you know what Bitcoin is exactly? It literally is one of the more significant inventions in our life time, and cannot be easily duplicated, because of the network effect and the fact that the currency aspect of the protocol is needed for incentive to secure the Blockchain.

I think our experiences are very similar.
I'm talking about the experience of 'average joe' in the US. Average joe doesn't have a reason to use Bitcoin. This might change tomorrow, but as of now merchants aren't offering enough incentive to use Bitcoin.

I take it you live in a developed country, yes?
Also the network effect is very strong. It's not safe for major businesses, including Wall Street, to build businesses on top of alt coins due to their lower hash rate and the risk of the coin being forked dangerously. We've seen it happen over and over again.

They're just not taking security seriously enough, and it's unfortunate that Bitcoin.com redirects to their wallet :/
Last year I myself found two big bugs in their iOS app the day of their releases! First bug was if you had your wallet denominated in Bits, and clicked to pay a BitPay/Coinbase invoice...it would send the wrong amount of Bitcoin to the merchant! 
Second in another version was if you clicked a BitPay/Coinbase invoice, the payment address/amount owed would be blank when the wallet opened.
They are amateur hour, it's sad that I'm just some random guy with hardly any technical background and I had to report these issues to them. 
@_date: 2015-01-02 21:13:05
1. Worldwide last year only 3 to 4 Million Cell phones were stolen. It's not a big issue like you might be painting it to be. That's out of literally 6.8 BILLION cell phone subscriptions worldwide. You can't paint something that's not an issue into an issue. Do you recognize how miniscule that number is, even if the theft rate was to multiply by 5x?
2. Share a few examples of a legit merchant screwing you over. I don't believe you.

1. Fraud: With Circle you are protected against Fraud. The ONLY way you're not covered from theft of Bitcoin in your wallet is if someone physically takes hold of your phone during the login process for the 2FA Verification. 
2. Chargebacks are overrated. Don't deal with shitty companies, then you won't have to ask for a chargeback. I'm in my 30s, have done TONS of shopping, and have never had to call for a chargeback due to a company treating me badly.

1. Because Circle can't partner with every single website/ business. (by doing off chain transactions) The way to do it would be over the Bitcoin network which everyone else would be using.
2. To the consumer that wants to use Circle in a manner where it's like PayPal: there is no major advantage of it over PayPal. It would be an option for people who want to use a service to send money quickly to people, friends, etc, and don't really care about how Bitcoin works, how you can store it yourself, etc.
3. Yes I like saving the merchant on fees. I don't like how they're restricted so much, and I know how much every last penny can help.

I'd feel it would be cool if Coinbase announced something like this. I'd honestly be like "Cool, alright, I can shop from my favorite online stores and all I have to do is scan the QR code at the payment page, and then it automatically deducts from my checking." 
It would be a glorified way to pay for things in an easier manner from my checking account, and if I want to acquire Bitcoin from Coinbase and take it elsewhere I also have that option.

I saw something online about Bitcoin, read about it, thought it was kinda interesting. I then downloaded Bitcoin QT, watched it sync for 30 minutes, and thought "I don't have time for this, I want to watch TV"
So I deleted the wallet and didn't hear about Bitcoin again until March 2013.

You're not understanding correctly. It's not an issue because the probability of this happening is very low.
1. They might be using a payment processor, the business has no worries.
2. The chances of a consumer having the technical knowledge, or ability to undo/send a transaction elsewhere after the initial transaction is VERY low. 
It's not a big issue.

Those two situations aren't comparable. Friendster was a company with a few hundred employees all working on the same goal. Bitcoin is a protocol that literally anyone in the world can work on if they have the technical knowledge. 
These individuals have no legit reason to use another coin.
@_date: 2015-01-28 23:28:07
Ok thank you, so this real world example would go as follows:
In my wallet, which I have complete control over, I have some Bitcoin that is marked as these "tokens". When I send that specific Bitcoin which is marked to any Bitcoin address then the receiving address will always receive that specific Dollar amount, no matter if the BTC exchange rate is higher or lower?
Is that how it would work?

They're just not taking security seriously enough, and it's unfortunate that Bitcoin.com redirects to their wallet :/
Last year I myself found two big bugs in their iOS app the day of their releases! First bug was if you had your wallet denominated in Bits, and clicked to pay a BitPay/Coinbase invoice...it would send the wrong amount of Bitcoin to the merchant!
Second in another version was if you clicked a BitPay/Coinbase invoice, the payment address/amount owed would be blank when the wallet opened.
They are amateur hour, it's sad that I'm just some random guy with hardly any technical background and I had to report these issues to them.
@_date: 2015-01-02 23:39:24

@_date: 2015-01-03 00:16:42
I know this will happen because I understand this space.
2 years ago I called that we'd have services that allowed you to tie Bitcoin to specific exchange rates of different currencies. Enter BitReserve &amp; Coinapult.
The next big thing we'll have is these wallets that allow you to shop with Bitcoin without the extra click of purchasing Bitcoin first. It's not that big of a deal to implement, Bitcoiners will love it (would allow you to use Coinbase as a glorified checking account for shopping online where your financial details aren't at risk of theft, and all you have to do is scan a QR code)
Then the next step (by the end of this decade) is chargeback protection for Bitcoiners using a certain service. It will go as follows: You use a Coinbase wallet, you shop at "Coinbase certified businesses" such as merchants that accept BitPay, Circle, Coinbase (which will all work together on the chargeback feature), and then you'll have your precious chargeback protection with certain merchants if you want it.
@_date: 2015-01-14 00:59:47
As a business owner you can look at it two ways:
1. Use a payment processor like BitPay so you're not at risk of fluctuating value.
2. Accept Bitcoin directly and assume the risk/reward going into the future.
@_date: 2015-01-14 00:54:58
See: the network effect. 
They have no reason to use Dogecoin as BTC is more liquid and more hash rate which lowers the risk of a bad actor doing something bad.
@_date: 2015-01-14 19:42:48
Good advice. Luckily if I wanted to go "all in" to BTC it's difficult because of rental property, farm, lakefront property we're trying to sell, some stock, gold/silver, and a little cash.

In this scenario (as far as the consumer is concerned) it would be no different than using a service like PayPal for example. It is the merchant who would be happiest the consumer is using Bitcoin because of low or no transaction fee and no chargebacks.

Are you 100% POSITIVE there is no way for you to "initiate" the refund process on the Expedia site?
I ask because last summer I had a similar experience. I was booking a hotel, paid the BTC invoice (which coinbase "cleared" immediately), then next thing I know a page popped up saying this hotel offer isn't available anymore, and that it hasn't been booked.
I then made the mistake of trying to call for 45 minutes, when it turns out under my account settings on the website there was an option to initiate the refund via Coinbase.
Give it a try. Otherwise stop being silly and expecting support emails to help, call and immediately ask for a supervisor that knows their Bitcoin payment option. Make sure he knows you know what you're talking about.

@_date: 2016-03-02 03:34:28
Haha, exactly. It's quite silly.
The future of Bitcoin isn't everyday joes using a calculator for each transaction to see what fee is needed. 
There will be exceptions (such as those who use the network for more advanced reasons), but for the majority of users they won't concern themselves with fee calculations.
If the fee is too high for their situation, they will move on to other payment methods. 
@_date: 2017-03-20 03:38:08
It wouldn't be called Bitcoin though. So much time will have passed that major businesses/exchanges are using the "BU Chain" that it will become "The Bitcoin".
It won't work with two coins named Bitcoin. "Man, you should invest in Bitcoin." or "My store accepts Bitcoin". This only works on a large scale with one of them, you can't have masses of people trying to differentiate between the two (buying BTC vs BTU).

There won't be a financial incentive if we don't raise the block size. Additionally, if we don't raise the block size then Bitcoin as a whole will become more "centralized", relying on a 3rd party company to do off chain transactions, and "on chain" transactions being very very expensive - in a way completely defeating the point of Bitcoin.

How would it fail if BU forks off with 75-80% of the network?
There's the difficulty retargeting for the 20% chain, which is a huge problem in itself. Then if it's a hard fork to change POW, difficulty, etc it would be an Alt-Coin by Core's standards.
There's just so much hypocrisy on both sides, it's ridiculous. 
@_date: 2017-03-18 16:11:59
Even if that were to be the case (I'm not saying it is) it still requires each party to listen to the other's concern, and try to find a middle ground.

I don't agree with your proposal because miners that survive that point will be "experts" and will plan in a way where the halving is expected and manageable.

Yeah, if bread doesn't exist someday then the wallet will still at least exist on your phone. Or if you want to take the recovery phrase to other wallets you can research online on how to do that.

Why? They have limited resources, it's even RISKIER to see if a minority chain survives when you're a company with only "x" amounts of burn rate and needs to grow users.
More importantly though, I wasn't a fan of their crowd funding.

Most people don't have objections about the 2-5cent fee right now.
Their main objection (even if they don't realize it) is using wallets that have them guess which fee is the correct one, which is terrible. Users shouldn't be choosing the fees, it should be automated by the wallet. (more advanced users can use wallets which let them choose the fee if they please)
@_date: 2017-03-21 16:54:20
I would argue that unless the fork has a HUGE flaw (such as the network just not working at all), the businesses in the ecosystem have a higher chance of success with the majority hashrate chain. (Compared to the other chain that will have significant delays, or needs to have yet another hard fork to survive)
Would that be a sound argument? 
@_date: 2017-02-16 15:01:48
A few notes:
1. It's weird how they use a crappy green screen.
2. The chubby guy is smart, thinking rationally.
3. The skinnier guy is a typical "reporter" type person, just spewing words without much reason. At one point he tries to make a "point" to be smart, but he's just repeating what the chubby guy said.

In my honest opinion it's because they're overly paranoid. I Store over $10k on mine - to this date there hasn't been a "hacking" incident in breadwallet because the keys are stored on the phones hardware level encryption - it's not accessible accept by you.

Hey Chris!
I was chatting with my brother today, and your app inspired us to think of another app idea! Maybe you could create it someday?
So essentially it's "Favor" meets Bitcoin (google favor if you're not aware)
1. I want a Cherry pie. I put the bidding at $10 and say I'll be at my location for the next hour. I send $10 to an escrow.
2. Somebody who is looking to earn Bitcoin sees my bid, and decides $10 is enough incentive to go buy me this product and bring it to my house.
3. The person brings the cherry pie to my house, and with a combination of location tracking and me confirming it was purchased (we each scan a QR code on each other's phones), the app knows I have my cherry pie and the BTC is released to the earner! 
(You take 1% of the total BTC transacted, there is a ratings system for each user where they rate each other)
Potential problems and how to avoid:
1. He gets to my house within the previously agreed on timeframe and I'm not there. (I had to leave the house for some reason). The person still gets my $10.
2. He gets to my house while I'm there and then I decide I don't want the cherry pie afterall. He still gets my $10
3. He gets to my house and doesn't have anything. Support asks him to take a picture of the receipt of the item with the timestamp, if he cannot deliver the receipt then he doesn't get the $10.
4. Continuation of above: he has the receipt and sends it but I say I never received the item even though he said I did. This is avoided by each of you scanning a QR code on each others phone. I only scan it if I get the item, he only scans it if I take the item from him.
I think it's a fun idea, want to set it in motion? :)
@_date: 2016-01-26 23:40:50
Can't wait to listen!
@_date: 2015-05-23 17:08:45
On a personal level I just don't think it's a concern or something they need to address with more options. I've done hundreds (yes hundreds) of purchases with Breadwallet and I can probably count the times my transaction didn't get included in the next block on one hand.
If anything they will address future obstacles in regards to fees in the app behind the scenes, not give the user control. They're aiming for a "google" like experience where it's as simple as possible IMO.
@_date: 2017-03-20 04:16:00
I'm not going to sell any BTC anytime soon.
I think you're underestimating how many people A. Don't care about all of this drama. B. Don't even and won't even know it's going on. All they'll see is price fluctuations.

I use Bitcoin and am lucky enough to be involved in businesses with Bitcoin. I don't see why I as a user would go back to the other chain after two months?

@_date: 2017-03-20 05:18:17
That is not the case, and I guarantee you it won't happen in practice. You're massively misunderstanding the situation.  I have no reason to make this stuff up - the biggest wallet providers will support the majority hashrate. 
These businesses are risk adverse and the idea of supporting a minority chain, that has to implement huge changes to survive (difficulty adjustment, PoW, etc) is too risk risky.
Most in the business realize that Bitcoin was going to get more centralized anyways, and don't worry too much about this thought.
There will always be smaller alts if someone wants even higher decentralization.

Hi Peter,
I'm a long time Bitcoin investor/holder as well as have invested in companies in the space. I'm asking you, please, try to find a compromise between the two parties. We don't want a hard fork, but will do what's necessary to survive (the companies) if we do.
I know you might say you've been trying, but keep trying, please. Heck, I'd even buy you a plane ticket to meet with miners, I'm dead serious. We need a resolution. Either side being stubborn won't help.
I've dealt with problem solving between people, there IS a resolution to be made, but BOTH sides have to want it and not just think their answer is the right one.

I'm telling you man (I'm involved with Bitcoin businesses). They're going to follow the chain with the most hashing power. (for better or worse)
These are services everyday people use to participate in bitcoin, shopping, sending value to friends, etc. The most popular services are going to take this route.
I wish we weren't in this situation, but it's the reality of the climate we're in.
If and only if BU displays huge operational problems, then would the industry as a whole (businesses on top of Bitcoin) move to a different chain/coin.
@_date: 2015-01-29 00:34:08
The part that it's not limited to one company (aka BitReserve) is cool. 
I'm just confused on how it would be more efficient than the BitReserve model? How is it more efficient or helpful to the Bitcoin community if BitReserve has the exact same outcome as far as the consumer is concerned?
I'm just failing to connect the dots I suppose,. The part about KYC being applied to tether really dampened my excitement 
Thanks for the help
@_date: 2017-03-30 19:39:23
not really without making things really complicated.

But how do we know what is sound or not? There is only 1% of us (at most) who truly understands the code. I don't think we're capable of deciding. I think we're only able to listen/debate and try to make an opinion about the matter (and hope that we're listening to the right person)

@_date: 2017-03-28 04:37:56
...they didn't "break that trust". A person created a dramatic thread that wasn't based on reality.
If your BTC is in bread, you and only you control the keys. If there is a minority chain that has any considerable support and survives, then they'll release a separate app to access those BTC.
This is EVEN if the minority chain was the "BU" chain, so they're not picking sides here.
Even if WORST case scenario bread went out of business tomorrow, you'd still have the app on your phone and you could STILL use your recovery phrase in another wallet.
@_date: 2017-03-20 15:20:17
it's not an attack though if they fork with 75-80% of the network. Goodness.
I don't want this to go down, but even I can admit this.

I too ran into an issue, they eventually fixed it. (I ran into the same thing as you)
It's never happened before - a temporary inconvenience 
@_date: 2016-03-10 14:50:24
This really shouldn't be the case, you're either mistaken or were rude on the phone, because they can't forbid you from making purchases that are legal.
All you should've done is called and said I'm trying to make a purchase online, they'd verify that it's you, and you'd make the purchase.
Just call back and if they ask what it's for, say it's an online purchase for a web service (which is true)

It's a stupid thing he said. Employers report the earnings they give their employees anyways. If someone is directly getting (or converting) their earnings to Bitcoin, it doesn't matter - the government will still know what they are owed.

The major wallets will follow the majority hashrate.

Which is the majority hashrate. You are not going to have the major companies jumping on a chain which for example has 30% of the network. There's no way a company such as Coinbase would do this.
@_date: 2017-03-05 00:51:04
In the future use Breadwallet - it determines fees based on network conditions.
@_date: 2017-03-19 18:51:36
Most businesses (even the ones in that document that was signed, which I believe was posturing) are not going to go along with a minority hashrate chain- they'll go with the majority.
We have limited financial runway (burn rate) and aren't going to hurt users with "$10 fees" for hour long confirmations. 
It just doesn't make sense. This is coming from someone who wishes this whole situation wasn't playing out. 
@_date: 2016-01-28 19:28:04

I use breadwallet - it determines fees pretty accurately. 
@_date: 2017-03-24 01:50:08
I don't think people get it. Please note that I have NOT made my mind up on what the right choice is, but if we hit 75%, 80% of the hash rate that wants to go a certain direction, **the industry will follow unless they can visibly see in action that this route will not work**
I'm not talking about predictions, I'm talking about actually witnessing it not working in real time.
Then the majority of the industry will follow, the majority of users will have **no** idea these arguments happened, and that is the implementation that will be known as "Bitcoin" around the world.
For better or worse, that is how it will play out. Self perceived morals or high grounds have no bearing in the real world, only the reality of the system with the most support of what's easiest to do.
"Core" knows that the PoW change and difficulty adjustment on a minority chain is a bluff, as does "BU" know that hard forking without the majority of the hash rate is bluff.
I'm sorry if these don't seem to be the ideals you signed on for, but it's the reality of the situation. You're not going to have all of these young bitcoin startups risk their livelihoods on a 20% minority chain that needs to hard fork yet again to survive.
I sincerely believe though however that like this article claims, scaling will be anticlimactic for 90% of people who use Bitcoin.

Say you know somebody who voted for "x" presidential candidate. If you label them as a lunatic, then no progress will ever be made. The first step to understanding why someone believes in something is to listen to them, then and only then can you present options to them, listen to their options, and find a middle ground.

@_date: 2017-03-20 15:34:15
I think the difference is people are able to choose whether or not they see it as an attack. I can tell you this (I have no reason to mislead), major businesses, wallets, etc that are built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain will stay with the majority hashrate.
Lets say if now @ 30% or 40% or 50% BU forked, then sure, the majority of the ecosystem would see it as an attack, and stay with the original chain.

Did you read their post? The if the minority chain survives, it will be supported.
It would be the same scenario if Segwit took 80% and the other 20% forked off. The minority chain would probably die.

Hi Budha,
Blockchain.info was delisted from Bitcoin.org as it's not even trustworthy anymore.
Use Breadwallet, it's amazing to me, and it's literally the most highly rated and respected mobile wallet. (Search Breadwallet on this subreddit and you'll see it's praise)
@_date: 2016-03-08 15:53:35

It took that long because the fee was .004cents USD. Hardly anything 
@_date: 2017-03-20 04:47:50
That's what I'm trying to say. When these unsuspecting people think they're using their Bitcoin as usual, they'll be using the new BU chain. This is what will happen with the most popular wallets/services built on top of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-01 20:41:16
Yes - mainly because 75% of my transactions don't need 10 min confirmation times. Most of the time I don't really care when I get a confirmation as long as it's not something where I wake up the next morning to still see it pending.
Not saying we shouldn't scale - just being honest.

I'm all for ideals but it's not going to happen unless the minority chain forks and changes the difficulty readjustment period.
If the minority chain goes for a major PoW change ... all of these major businesses aren't going to risk their livelihoods on something so unproven. They have limited amounts of capital and are young, they need to grow and expand - it's too risky.
@_date: 2017-03-30 20:33:39
breadwallet doesn't control your money as you have the private keys. 
referencing their blog, you'll be able to go either way with your funds if there's a hard fork with both chains showing considerable support: 
@_date: 2019-11-10 05:12:13
Yes it is optional, you don’t have to use BitPay like you don’t have to use Visa. 
They don’t charge you an extra fee.
I’ve bought using them countless times and when I did need a refund there was no id involved.
There is no relationship, take off your tin foil hat. If there was, I’m a crappy person they chose to do it
@_date: 2017-03-26 03:19:42
Sir, these companies (wallets) have limited resources. They are NOT going to risk their livelihoods waiting to see if a minority chain survives. This INCLUDES if the minority chain was a "BU"
Chain. 
@_date: 2017-03-26 03:35:31
I think you overestimate how many people care which chain survives. Money talks, and the chain which makes the miners the most money will thrive.
You're not going to have businesses wait around on a difficulty change, or an untested PoW change, that is the reality of the situation. 
@_date: 2017-03-17 23:16:31
I am not choosing sides (sincerely) but if the majority of hash rate (in a big way) goes to BTU then I can guarantee you the exchanges will call it "Bitcoin"
@_date: 2017-03-30 16:59:20
The slide was stupid, yes. I'm paraphrasing but one was along the lines of "Just pay the $5 fee unless you're stupid" 
@_date: 2017-03-22 15:00:40
You mean well (and in an extreme technical sense, you are 100% correct), but to this date breadwallet has never been hacked. It's just not possible to reach those private keys.

72 hours at the most usually. It happens VERY rarely, it should confirm.

I don't think that's the case. I'm watching the network and many transactions (if not most) are at least 7-8cents + USD fee. Of course there are many variables as you know, but you get the picture. 
@_date: 2016-06-10 15:20:39

I hear what you’re saying, but there are other btc payment processing resources, and from their point of view it must have created SO many headaches (refunds, incorrect amounts) that they felt it was worth it to risk their business on. (Long sentence, sorry)
I can guarantee you they didn’t want to make that protocol, but then they ran into so many users that don’t understand bitcoin amounts which made it necessary.
@_date: 2016-06-22 22:56:19
When you send from breadwallet, typically it's a 4cent fee, maybe a few cents more. This is the fee paid to the miners that confirm your transaction.

It's the most secure and easiest manner of storing your Bitcoin on a phone. The wallet uses hardware level encryption, meaning you can fill your phone to the brim with Bitcoin stealing malware/viruses and your "keys" will be safe.

iOS wallets (and android too on Marshallow capable phones) are more secure than a PC. The private keys (for wallets that do it right) are stored in a secure area of the phone where malware cannot reach it. So these phones could be filled to the brim with Malware and still be more secure than a PC connected to the internet.
Now as far as a PC that's not connected to the internet, sure, that would probably be technically more secure in some cases if done right.

Cheers 
@_date: 2017-01-25 03:15:17
No, but there's a good chance it'll confirm (in my opinion) tomorrow. 
The wallet you sent the transaction with attached a very low fee. The fee should've been 5~ times that amount.
Try using a wallet that tries to handle fees more appropriately, like breadwallet 
@_date: 2017-01-26 18:04:05
Sure thing - I've had the privilege of meeting the developers, and it's great to see that side of things (versus just a website)
Additionally, there hasn't been one reported incident of funds stolen with breadwallet yet (on phone's that aren't jailbroken)
Add to the fact that the wallet is open source, community reviewed, etc etc - I just feel really comfortable. Store a significant amount in there.
@_date: 2017-01-09 19:57:17

they're different in that with breadwallet, you and only you control the bitcoin. With Coinbase you can hold Bitcoin with them, but it's essentially an IOU. You have to trust that they'll give it to you if you wish to send it out.
Haven't seen any dramatic red flags regarding Coinbase, but those are the main differences.
Also, it looks in the future you can fund your breadwallet inside the app, as it shows on their FAQ on a feature to be added to the wallet soon.

don't know if it's necessary to "fix fees" as it's not possible to 100% predict what the necessary fee will be.
I've confirmed that they use  and use the recommended fee for 120 mins or less as listed on their site. In most cases sending a fee higher than that is unnecessary as 21.co tends to even overestimate a little bit.

Nope, completely serious. People who say "no matter what the minority chain should be followed" are delusional, or have zero business sense.
These businesses built on top of Bitcoin are **extremely** risky to begin with, they're not going to risk going down with the ship on a minority chain that has to hard fork to survive or even worse a PoW change.
People aren't understanding that the BitPay team is made up of rational individuals: if SegWit2x threatened things like increasing 21 mil limit to 42 mil coins, changed average block time to 1 minute, the chain flat out didn't function, etc etc then of **course** they wouldn't follow it.
People need to realize the world is much bigger and more complex than they think, and sometimes when they think they're "sticking it to the man" they're just being silly and missing out on great opportunities ahead.

There's nothing wrong with a good review, but it's obvious when they are too good to be true - that means Circle either asked friends/family to bombard to store, or were personally behind the reviews themselves.
When the reviews are too specific, and optimistic, and point out too many features, that's how you know it's fake. "Oh yeah, my neighbor is a Brit, and I told him they take Euros, and he's psyched! Not to mention my mom loves using it for sending GIFs"

Yes, I agree - miners will follow the money.
For the record, I'm not advocating for 2x.
I'm advocating for being rational and not going down with the ship on a 10% hashrate chain. (especially since the 90% hashrate chain, in this hypothetical situation, is NOT changing aspects of bitcoin that will negatively impact it's functionality or it's ability to bring in further investors)

Oh goodness yes, it was a very low fee. Hopefully this weekend congestion on the Bitcoin network slows down, and it confirms by Monday morning.
If not, there is somewhat of a chance that for 2 weeks it won't confirm, and then the Bitcoin will "return" to its original wallet.

by effective do you mean wallets finally coming around to supporting seg wit transactions? a year and a half from now?
@_date: 2017-08-06 19:01:32
No, it doesn't. Please see where you're mistaken:
Paying a 20 sat/byte fee on a 226 byte transaction or 1000 byte transaction doesn't make a difference to the miner in terms of when the transaction will be confirmed, because the same rate of fee is being paid on each.
The only difference between the two is the user had to pay a higher fee for the 1000 byte transaction.

bread android came out summer of last year, as it required Android Marshmallow and above. It's the first form of the android OS that works with capable phones to prevent malware from stealing Bitcoin. This is why it has fewer reviews. A lot of 1 stars, in my opinion, are exaggerated because some don't like that it uses the bits denomination, or provides "easy" backup of the wallet via email (which is much more prone to theft)
Make no mistake, if an android wallet works on versions earlier than Android, then it's not as secure.
With Marshmallow, you could fill your phone to the brim with bitcoin stealing malware and your Bitcoin would be safe. (for wallets that take advantage of this security)
@_date: 2017-01-27 16:38:07
In my opinion if you use Mycelium on android or iOS, you're not using a wallet as secure as you should be. They are at risk of Bitcoin stealing malware because the wallet doesn't require hardware level encryption.
breadwallet for example uses hardware level encryption. Your phone could be filled to the brim with Bitcoin stealing malware and your Bitcoin would be safe.

You're doing more harm than good. You've responded 5 or 6 times alone in this thread- it's incredibly disruptive.
Bitcoin can be very confusing, and wallets like Breadwallet are trying to do good and communicate with us. You're confusing tons of people even further, who don't understand Bitcoin that well to begin with. Then they'll try to import their private keys into another wallet, and many will mess up in the process resulting in losing their Bitcoin. Or they'll send their Bitcoin to an unproven wallet thinking it's safe and will get screwed over.
I see it happen all the time (as a Bitcoin advocate). 
Your whole 1st page of post history is just bashing Breadwallet. You're doing more harm than good, I'm telling you from first hand experience. 
@_date: 2017-08-28 16:25:04
You'll see.
What you're failing to see is the lack of survival for a 10% chain. It won't be profitable to mine, and the difficulty adjustment period could take months. 
SO in order to survive, that 10% chain will have to hard fork, or PoW chain, which by your definition would be an alt, and it wouldn't be Bitcoin anymore.

Please note, miners are not invincible however: all of the above mentioned companies would not follow if the fork changed how many total coins there were, or if the network flat out didn't work, etc.

Can I ask why it feels like a "trick"?
I promise I'm not trying to argue, or be rude - if you met me on the street you'd think (hopefully) that I was a pretty cool guy.
The backlogs and fees are ridiculous. The majority of miners have decided to take measures that aren't that drastic to try and help, why is it a bad thing?
I'm just so confused why so many people follow Core? Core is now contemplating/slightly threatening a Proof of Work change just because they're not getting their way... why are they so mad?
They're overblowing the risks to raising the block size this little. It's just confusing, this whole scenario. Then we have Core devs like Luke-Jr who makes Twitter polls about wanting to LOWER the block size to 300kb, when we're already suffering and businesses built on top of bitcoin on struggling to stay alive.
I do not think Core has good intentions, I seriously don't. If they are good intentions, they're good towards their interests.

I'd also like to know how their iOS wallet always gets so many 5 star reviews, DESPITE the fact that their wallet is never recommended to use on reddit. Out of 39 reviews, 35~ of them are 5 stars. It doesn't make any sense, there has to be vote rigging going on.

It's not an easy decision, I know. Trust me, I (and we) wish this dilemma wasn't occuring.
I have personally determined it's not a big risk. (the 2x plan - not risky enough to warrant staying with the hypothetical 10% chain)
I respect if you don't agree with me.

Passion, you have. 
@_date: 2017-08-28 00:28:59
Can you answer this for me?
If the majority of the hashrate goes one direction (and this direction is only a block size increase, not dangerous things like changing to 42mil coins), and Coinbase, bitpay, and all of the major wallets and exchanges determine that it's Bitcoin, is it not bitcoin?
Or is the rational decision to act like Samourai wallet or Luke Jr, tweeting things like "WE FIGHT FOR THE USERS!1"
I promise you I'm not a bumbling idiot, and I don't think you are either. But I'm not going down in flames (with my money alongside as well) on a minority chain that has to have a PoW change to survive. 
@_date: 2017-08-06 18:32:24
That's a normal fee now (as of today). It will confirm quickly.

@_date: 2016-11-29 05:20:16
No way! :)
I had to send a big transaction today, one that had many inputs. It was ~7 times bigger than most transactions (1,699 bytes). Fee was 81centsUSD to send, pretty high!

I can tell you're passionate (as am I). However as Bitcoin grows there will be online Bitcoin banks that for the most part are pretty trustworthy to the average joe and their daily needs.

For the majority of the population for btc wallets, breadwallet is the easiest/most secure 
@_date: 2017-08-22 20:30:28
"Altcoin" is subjective. Especially since 2x and "legacy Bitcoin" use the exact same hashing function and difficulty calculation.
All SPV wallets are this way: bread, mycelium, airbitz, etc. 
It's just the way things are. I'm not advocating one way or another, just sharing the news. 
@_date: 2016-11-18 16:06:22
Yes, than a desktop wallet. With ios and Android Marshmallow phones and above (with certain wallets), the private keys are stored in a secure manner where even if you download a malware app, that malware app can't reach the bitcoin.
This isn't the case with desktop wallets.

@_date: 2016-11-17 16:31:25
I'm not sure. It's my personal belief that iOS/google stores need to require "x" amount of identification from a developer before approving an app that handles people's money. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 17:47:23
I'm on mobile, so short reply: Yes, a 3rd chain will be terrible which will dramatically reduce confidence for investors in which is "the" Bitcoin. 
PoW change will not restore confidence. There is a lack of 9 years track history on the PoW change.

It requires Marshmallow capable android phones that have the secure hardware to keep keys from any apps that might be malicious.

Please see my reply above on another comment: when a review points out too many features, and is too positive, by so many different reviewers at once - it's not a coincidence.
It's a dramatic surge in reviewing activity on their app, they never get this many reviews, even in a month.
@_date: 2016-11-03 01:12:07
breadwallet on ios and Android IMO
@_date: 2017-08-28 15:19:03
I feel like a lot of people are really naive. IF 2X occurs, and the majority of hashrate follow (for example 10% stays on original chain, price plummets on original chain, 2 month long difficulty readjustment or Pow change) then the industry will follow the fork.
Don't be so blinded and naive by some "loyal cause" you think you're fighting. It's getting old.
Edit: I'm not saying 2X IS going to happen, I'm saying IF it does WITH 90% of hash rate, the industry will follow them

**Only posting here so it's seen at the top:** this is not how Coinbase's merchant invoices work - you do not have to wait 15 minutes for a confirmation. You have 15 minutes to INITIATE the transaction, that's all.

@_date: 2016-11-23 06:27:28
There's no agenda, just what makes sense. Popular wallets for consumers are not going to have options to "make transactions go through faster" after they've already been sent. It's too confusing and creates too many questions. 
@_date: 2016-12-09 16:29:56
For what it's worth Circle did have fees, it's just their strategy was different - they had the same Buy/sell price. 
@_date: 2017-08-28 02:05:53
Can you at least understand their point of view?
IF this whole 2x thing happened, and the majority of hashrate and dollar value went with it, can you imagine how pissed off their users would be if breadwallet stayed with a 10% hashrate chain?
"What the hell?!? Why is my one Bitcoin worth $500?!? It was worth $4300 yesterday what is going on?!?!"
It is too risky and you're not giving them enough credit. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 01:50:11
$75,000 USD will get them nowhere in app development. Not trying to be rude, it’s just the reality of the situation. 
@_date: 2017-08-20 06:17:23
that's why I like breadwallet. it dynamically calculates fees depending on network conditions. right now there are only 2,500 transactions in the memepool and bread's transaction fee is 20 sat/byte
it's awesome 
@_date: 2018-06-20 10:39:25
While their added “network fee” is not fun, the $2~ figure is actually quite accurate right now.
The fees at this moment are much higher than they have been as of late.

@_date: 2016-11-14 06:03:00
just scan your ID for circle, it's not that big of a deal.
this isn't like any other "online store", IF you wanted to (not saying you would), you could send your bitcoin to "bad people" or "bad causes" and the company has to protect itself by knowing more about the customer.
I promise Circle doesn't WANT to ask for that ID, they think of it as a pain as well
@_date: 2016-11-25 15:15:24
breadwallet's fees changes automatically depending on network conditions. The goal being to get into the next 1 to 3 blocks. 
@_date: 2016-12-18 19:18:50

Bitpay is making the right decisions here (for their own survival)
I love Bitcoin, and will use it as often as it makes sense, but when it doesn't make financial sense (fees) I'm just going to use Bitcoin cash.
I don't care what someone tries to tell me. BCH supporters are not "evil" or "corrupt", it's just a group of people that don't like the path Bitcoin is taking (for better or worse) and want to take a different direction.
@_date: 2016-12-12 01:49:46
I'm bullish but I'm concerned if transaction capabilities (more transactions) will be possible through updates on the network.
I can't see it being a huge worldwide store of value with 300,000 transactions a day capability.
@_date: 2017-01-06 00:54:02
Focus on these key aspects when trying to understand what Bitcoin brings to the table:
1. It is the first of it's kind for a finite digital asset (you cannot copy and paste a Bitcoin, or send counterfeits) 
2. They're extremely rare, only 16MM~ that exist.
3. You can have complete control over this asset. Hold and send it when you please.
4. You can send it to whomever you please in the world that will accept it.
5. It is capable, and has extreme first mover advantage.

@_date: 2016-12-01 21:05:04
this can't happen with breadwallet on android as the wallet only works on Marshmallow and above, allowing the private keys to be stored in an unreachable location from malware.

@_date: 2016-12-29 19:00:21
it's actually very fast. 10~ mins to a few hours, depending on the circumstances.
you just think it's slow because of credit cards, and how you "think" the transactions go through right away - but in reality for the consumer and business it takes many days, and sometimes months for the business to get the money from the credit card company.

**Edit 2:** 1. I learned that Dash confirmations are instant, and can't be reversed. 2. Dash has a "treasury" where they set aside a batch of coins for research funding. 3. Dash is the only crypto currency developing an app that looks and feels like Venmo.

It’s much riskier to hold your funds in Coinbase, due to social engineering. This isn’t possible with the BRD app.
The breach requires tools that government agencies have, requires physical access to the device (it can’t be done remotely), and they’re more unsuccessful than successful on those attempts.

Hi James,
Thank you for taking the time to respond. I had two requests, please:
1. Long story really short, I work in wallet development for one of the top wallets, and I've noticed many times in the past that the added network fee for your Bitcoin invoices does not match what the current network conditions are (e.g. they're way too high)-  (we should only have to pay an added cost for the current network conditions - not what they might be in the future). I've submitted this to Github with data/statistics, and I hope that your team has looked into it (this was 2 weeks ago, I haven't shopped since then - have been busy)
2. Many times even when the fee I attach to my transaction is perfectly adequate for a fast transaction ( &lt;60 mins), I receive the email from Bitpay of "your added fee was too low", followed with an explanation of how fees work (I'm sure you know which email I'm speaking of). It seems that the times when this email is sent needs to be tweaked.
To clarify so you don't think I'm sending you on a random egg hunt - Bitcoin/crypto is pretty much my life, and for better or worse I know all about how fees work when sending transactions. 
@_date: 2016-12-29 00:56:03
These guys jump ship too quickly, not very much foresight. 
They stop only supporting Bitcoin because they "think Ethereum will make great headway", then they start supporting Ethereum classic because they're not sure which fork will win out. Then they stop supporting ethereum classic.
Not enough confidence/planning in their vision.

Don't understand, hope someone can help

@_date: 2018-06-16 05:49:01
You’re correct.
The worries of “holding funds on an internet connected device” are overblown though, especially when you use applications that are configured correctly. 
For example, I’d argue that an iOS/Android device that has a wallet is more secure than a Ledger/Trezor (if the phone wallet uses the hardware encryption of the phone itself)
Apple has billions at stake with their security. Trezor, while a great team, is a much smaller company with much fewer resources - not to mention they’ve run into breaches of security already in the past.

Purse instant gives 5% off and the purse administrators but the item immediately, begin the shipping to you.

@_date: 2016-11-22 18:55:42
It won't work, friend. Mass market wallets have to be as simple as possible, and this requires taking the fee estimation and related subjects away from the table. 
The successful consumer friendly wallets will make things as straightforward as possible, there won't be a "boost and accelerate" option in these wallets. That would scare away too many newbies with confusing options. At most the companies' FAQ will address why delays occur sometimes.
There will be more advanced wallets that do offer the feature you speak of, however. Just not the ones that will (successfully) target mass market appeal.

I phrased it incorrectly - a phone wallet (which uses the hardware encryption correctly) is safer kept at home than a Ledger or Trezor due the much larger amount of resources dedicating to keep iOS/Android safe.
The friends/spouse scenario is different, and not a fault of the phone wallet. A friend too needs to only guess the pin on your Ledger.

Okay. Can you please humor me just so I can understand?
I know you this think is BS (I do too), but let's say the original bitcoin chain died (this is a thought exercise)
Bitcoin as we know it is worth $0, "Segwit 2x" is worth $7,000. This is all hypothetical. 
Even though you still have the same amount of value (in fiat), you would be mad if the wallet if the wallet called this chain "Bitcoin"? 
What would you do (in this hypothetical situation) where most other services did this? Would you keep and or sell this imposter coin? Or would you just delete your private keys because it has no value to you?

Thank you, appreciate it. Let's see what they say.
I definitely prefer the 8% buffer. They're going to lose a lot of potential customers who are on the fence to begin with if they require users to account on their own for volatility:

As of now Purse doesn't allow you to "buy" amazon gift cards (as it doesn't really make sense)
There's really no risk of buying Gamestop Gift Cards via "Purse" because it's a much more complicated process of deactivating them compared to just Amazon deactivating their own gift cards.

I wanted to explain to you how my situation was easily fixed online. Like I told you. I had a terrible experience due to expedia's site "glitching" out on me. Afterwards the mistake I made was actually calling and speaking to a person at Expedia. For some reason they couldnt find that itinerary number the error message gave me and to top it off they didn't know what Bitcoin was.
Finally, to fix my problem I just went to the website (expedia) entered my email address and itinerary of the failed booking, and had a refund from coinbase in minutes, it was really easy.
I wish I would've done that from the start. I didn't realize I could/should just do it so easily online.
If you do talk to Expedia, please try to sort this glitch out with them. It was incredibly frustrating.

If a wallet labels a minority chain with 10% hashpower as "Bitcoin", that's a sign you need to change wallets. When that occurs, the exchange rate on that chain will plummet, and the users will scream "Where did my money go?!? Why do I have $10 now when I had $100 yesterday?!?"

Here are my personal thoughts on some of your bullet points regarding breadwallet:
1. I don't know if the average person (if they used Bitcoin) want more than 1 "Wallet" to use Bitcoin.  I could understand the potential for different tabs, which are subsets of the same wallet (Spending, Savings, Etc). That said I can understand why more involved people could want multiple wallets.
2. It's just a personal preference, I don't mind the PIN (or touch ID). It doesn't take anymore time for me.
4. I could see how this could be beneficial to advanced and novice users.
6. I open my wallet at least twice a week, so personally I don't notice much syncing. (I'm on WiFi or LTE every time I sync, so that might make a big difference over 3G - I'm not sure)
I enjoyed your write up.
@_date: 2015-07-08 17:21:26
Thanks Mike - can I make a recommendation as someone who's not too technical? Some kind of increase that is constant...where every "x" amount of blocks the block size increases by "x" percent. I just feel that could avoid a whole lot of headaches. Or an update that's similar to that nature.

I'm just speaking for the majority of people. You tell them: You can get Bitcoin by linking a checking account or meeting someone at Starbucks for a cash transaction - most will choose the checking account route. 
To top it off the checking account route is much cheaper than cash transactions (cash goes at a higher rate) - so it doesn't make sense in developed areas to do cash conversions. The only reason to use cash transactions is if you want less of a risk of being tracked/monitored. 
@_date: 2015-08-27 21:45:36

Man, they took you for a spin - making false promises to you. 
@_date: 2015-07-08 01:38:34
It's true, I think some wallets in the future will offer something like that (if they don't already) I just don't think it's part of the plan for Breadwallet right now - trying to eliminate as many things as possible that could confuse or make the experience more difficult for users. 
Default off option is a good idea but the majority of people if they found that option wouldn't understand it and could possibly be unsettling - I think breadwallet is aiming to be as accessible as possible across the general population.

thank you michael. I'm trying one more round of emails with them and I'll see how it goes. If it goes badly, I'll be reaching out to you.
It really was an annoying "glitch" on expedia's site, and effectively took $400~ of my money "hostage" until they sort this out. The following only took 3 minutes or so: I found a hotel, clicked book, clicked Bitcoin payment option, promptly paid the invoice in full by scanning the QR code, and then immediately their site took me to a "I'm sorry, it took longer than 30 minutes and the room can't be held for you. Expect a refund in 2-5 business days."
Terrible user experience.

Exactly. I'm tired of this argument that "My Super Nintendo needs to be able to run a node!" It's ridiculous. Businesses and extreme hobbyists will run nodes.

Peter Todd gets tiresome. 
@_date: 2019-06-11 16:47:00
Exactly. These keyboard warriors who always just jump on the "Fuck Bitpay" bandwagon are idiots.
Bitpay is just a company, an imperfect company. They're not perfect but they're not these evil assholes that this message board makes them out to be.
In case you don't remember, Dec 2017 really SUCKED. A normal transaction had like $40 fees, and this was hurting everyone. I was onboard for a blocksize increase but I'm not bitter it didn't happen. It was a stressful time for bitcoin companies.
@_date: 2015-07-06 23:10:36
because every version is open source, and it's available each time it updates with tons of nerds MUCH smarter than you and I looking at it.

@_date: 2015-07-07 04:14:42
You can't. 
Future version will scale fee accordingly to network conditions. 
You don't change a fee to "send a visa transaction faster" and the common user won't want to mess with fees if they use Bitcoin. 
If fees is something you want to change manually that is perfectly fine, there will be other wallets available. 
@_date: 2015-07-07 21:30:30
It's not. Future version of release will change the fee dynamically according the network conditions.

I think there is misunderstanding on your behalf, respectfully: once the transaction propagates across a certain number of nodes, within 10 seconds it's pretty much safe and good to go. That's how processors like Coinbase and Bitpay protect themselves, they aren't taking on much risk.
So sure, if you're selling your house for $200k worth of Bitcoin, wait for some confirmations. Otherwise if you're just buying groceries or a video game or something, the merchant isn't taking on much risk.
@_date: 2015-07-28 21:30:05
Makes sense. For developed countries it takes "Purse like" discounts to get excited about Bitcoin it seems. (other than conditioning by younger people growing up and learning/using Bitcoin in their daily lives)
In underdeveloped countries Bitcoin speaks for itself regarding online commerce.

**okay, I just called Gyft. They said this a new development and several people have reached out to them regarding this issue. They know it's an inconvenience and are looking into it. I kindly stressed that it's not really a necessary step as they're really not taking on much risk using Bitpay as their processor.** 
My old post: This is a VERY new development for Gyft. I use Gyft all the time (several times a week) and this is the first time I've seen a pop up of "awaiting payment confirmation" when I try to open the Gift card that appears in my account right after paying them.
I think it's quite silly as they're not really taking on more risk compared to the million other times I used their app (including last week). I will contact them about this, see if they can make this more streamlined.
@_date: 2015-07-11 00:34:49

You have complete control over your bitcoin. Did you know that the bread company has no control over your Bitcoin, and cannot initiate transfers on your behalf? 
It's literally one of the safest places to keep your BTC in the event of a fork. 
Let's get hypothetical- let's say for some reason the original Bitcoin chain dies (which none of us want), and it's worth $0 in fiat. Do you still want bread to only support that chain "til the bitter end"?
@_date: 2015-07-20 03:11:22
I don't know, read their TOS. Most likely not. 
@_date: 2015-07-27 19:07:53
They've stated to me that it's not allowed, and they do what they can to prevent it (such as people can only make small purchases at first to remove less risk from the process).
I'm sure some bad things happen. All I'm saying is I've used it 12 times without incident and it's not up to me (the consumer) to prove if fraud is at play or not.

I don't think your first recommendation will be an option because they're aiming it to be as easy as possible. The majority of people, if they ever tried Bitcoin, would be incredibly frustrated trying to figure out which fee to choose if given an option.
@_date: 2015-07-21 21:37:05
This is more representative of store policy, and not Bitcoin itself.
If I was in those shoes, yes, I would be annoyed. It's only a few mouse clicks to send you a refund.

@_date: 2015-08-14 20:45:09
Let's recap, I said people in developed countries. (More specifically, people who have checking accounts)
I do know how the majority think (of those people I referenced above). A very small percentage of them have a desire to exchange cash for Bitcoin. If they were to consider using Bitcoin, they'd much rather just link up electronically. 
I can guarantee you I'm more than a "speculator". I just recognize the reality of situations: it's much cheaper and more convenient to acquire Bitcoin when linking up your checking account/credit card.
Ideally you just get paid in Bitcoin and skip that step. We're not there yet.

That's not the way it works. If a purchase fails then the points automatically get added back into your account after some time.
In regards to the Target card failing, this is most likely the cashier not knowing how to process it correctly. Trust me, I've done 100s of transactions at target with Gift Cards and sometimes I have to show the employees how to process gift cards. (I've got it memorized)

A lot of what you say makes sense. 
Personally I paid my DISH Network bill this morning with Breadwallet 4 hours ago, and still no confirmation. That being said it didn't affect me personally because DISH uses coinbase so my payment was 'confirmed' right away. 
I can assure you in my experience I haven't really spoken with a group of people that take Bitcoin more seriously than the breadwallet team. They know this can affect some people and I bet are talking about this issue all the time these weeks. Part of the 'next few weeks' factor is the process of Apple approving an update, it's not always instant to get on the store as you know. 
But yes, it will be an automatic fee that analyzes the condition of the network at the time of transaction being sent. 
(Disclosure: I'm biased as an investor but this investment took a lot of thinking and consideration. There is literally no other bitcoin wallet I'd invest in right now, I sincerely mean it.)
Edit: there we go, 4 hours later it got a confirmation after I wrote this post :)

I was able to meet him (Jordan) in Austin in 2013, here are my impressions of him from a brief meet and a few emails:
He's an incredibly ambitious dude that got caught up in the hype/media train of 2013 when BTC was rising insanely fast and he was featured on CNBC a time or two. I then think it seems he got ahead of himself, ran into problems with the company he wasn't expecting, then made a decision to look out for the survival of his company/his assets first before doing right by those that already jumped on the train with him.
All in all it seems like you hurt his feelings/ego with your move. (I don't blame you though)
There are 3 scenarios that can happen now:
1. His company will go bankrupt and you'll never see more money.
2. His company will continue to grow and he'll eventually do right by you.
3. His company will continue to grow and he won't pay you back out of spite.

Exactly. These people would never run a successful business that could scale because they have no idea what their words mean.
You're not going to have wallet users direct their wallet towards a node because they can barely describe what Bitcoin is in the first place.

hard to navigate? there are two screens - send and receive.
Also, you can change the bitcoin denomination on the currency selection screen by swiping left on the very top where the exchange rate is.
if bitcoin is truly successful (for consumers) it will be bits that is most used. It's much easier to say "Send me $53 worth of bitcoin or 40,000 bits" then saying for example "Send me .004343 BTC"

It's not that big of a deal:
They take security very seriously. There's a reason for example they released their android app in Summer 2016 - it's because before then the OS wasn't secure enough. Most of the other Android wallets are terrible with security and private keys can be easily extracted for those who know what they're doing.
If a Bitcoin wallet works on a version of Android earlier than 6.0, it shouldn't be trusted.

Okay, so if tomorrow the "BU" chain hard forks with 40% of the hashrate, then it would have a higher price than the "Core" chain with 60% of the hashrate?
That's not how it would work. I would suggest not trying to make things political. All of these companies are with hard working people, they're not ill intentioned or trying to hurt anyone. They're trying to do what they think is best.

I think people speak of ideals a lot but don't understand the reality of the world. If 80% of the hashrate goes in one direction, the industry WILL follow regardless of what that direction is unless the chain flat out doesn't function.
You're not going to have companies that have a limited amount of funding wait around for a chain that takes 2 months of waiting for the difficulty to correct, and you're not going to have these same companies risk their entire future on a PoW change hard fork. It's just not the way things will work out.
The chain that's the longest will have the highest price and therefore most of the industry will follow.
It's probably a moot point anyways because it's not going to happen. What will probably happen is a UASF or extension blocks.

I might be biased (as I've met the developer-a great guy, use the wallet several times a week) but I haven't run into issues like that. 
What you saw last August might've been what a lot of other wallets saw around that time regarding fees not being done correctly due to lots of transactions, that has been addressed now. 
For shopping online I prefer breadwallet as opposed to using my credit card for example. I'd try it again, works great for me.
@_date: 2017-04-09 03:20:27
It's not though, they're not dedicating themselves one way or another. If the "Core" chain becomes the longest (in the event of a hard fork) then they'd follow them.

The only way is by a double spend (after they send your transaction they go and try to send the transaction again to themselves with a higher network fee, to try and "beat" your transaction by getting a confirmation first)
It's unlikely, but could happen. Once you have a confirmation then you're good to go.

Fees look alright to me now in breadwallet, about 40~ cents, which is needed to get into the next 1-8 blocks for an average transaction size of 226 bytes.

There are so many different factors. Network congestion, the fee that was attached to the transaction, etc 
@_date: 2016-02-25 15:39:02
It's important to note however (don't worry, I use breadwallet), that if you store Bitcoin with a service such as Coinbase or Circle for example, that Bitcoin is by definition of the law "yours". Meaning there is legal recourse.
That said laws can change and from a variety of conditions that may or may not happen it could be a challenge to withdraw Bitcoin from them.

I do respect your opinion, except the part of "it sucks". It's one of the most reliable wallets with continuous development. They lack advanced features (such as choosing your own fee) because they're targeting everyday people and the vast majority of people don't know how to calculate fees correctly.
I use bitcoin at least every 3 days (with breadwallet ios), and no issues. I'm also fairly involved with my brother in following his usage, and he uses bread on android. At first the android release had trouble syncing (this was about 6~ months ago) but updated versions since then he doesn't have this issue anymore.

breadwallet 
@_date: 2016-02-29 22:05:17
Use a wallet that does the thinking for you. Just use breadwallet to send for example and not concern yourself with fee calculations.
@_date: 2017-04-04 20:59:46
In the U.S. for me it's breadwallet. I got activated for buy bitcoin via bank account, it's awesome. I think in the weeks to come they're activating more and more people. 
@_date: 2016-02-24 17:48:08
I'm guessing because it took something like Bitcoin for entrepreneurs to think of this idea.
A "Purse.io of dollars" can be built, but it requires the company forming banking relationships, verifying all the identities of their users, etc. Not easy.

Use Breadwallet. It uses hardware level encryption and Bitcoin stealing malware can't touch it 
@_date: 2017-04-09 02:44:09
Dunno, I've never had it happen to me too long except for those few times there were like 90,000-100,000 transactions that were waiting for confirmation. 
Haven't had that many issues. To each his own though. 
@_date: 2017-04-05 23:21:14
Donations don't really work in Bitcoin anymore unless they're larger donations, like $5 worth each time.
Otherwise the transaction fees on the network (congestion) will just eat up all of your donations

regardless of the FUD being thrown around, any wallet in which you control the private keys will be fine.
You always have recourse to adapt to situations if you have the private keys

@_date: 2017-04-14 14:25:43
I hate high fees as much as the next person, but is it really spam if it's an actual transaction with actual fees added to it?
My belief is that if a transaction is made, and a fee is added, then it's not spam because it costs actual money to conduct. I don't care if it's one rich guy sending btc to himself over and over again, if he's paying a fee (even if it's low) then he's entering himself in the confirmation lottery.
I cannot stress enough so I'm not attacked: I hate high fees and want bitcoin to scale.

To his "defense" he shouldn't need to know how fees work. His wallet (if it's a good one) should be doing that work for him - the lowest possible fee that is effective enough for the majority of use cases.

I think the difference in opinion is that the BCH code in itself isn't a "scam". All the rules are plainly laid out for those to see in the source code, and everybody on that network has to abide by those rules (just like BTC)
It's just that some people don't like the people who support Bitcoin Cash, that's all it is. (don't make this political) 
@_date: 2018-11-27 23:32:17
Why will they not implement Segwit ever? Have they said this? 
@_date: 2018-11-20 15:02:51
1. The space savings for native Segwit (bech32) are much higher, making it worth it.
2. Personally I think that for a crypto wallet which holds btc, BCH, eth, and etc20, it’s quite silly to denominate the whole wallet in btc or bch.

Hey Mike,
I've done tons of orders with them, and have conversed with Eric as well. While there have been some glitches in the website, Eric has always done me right. (I helped test their bitcoin implementation in the beginning because it's fun to me and I wanted to help)
I recommend continuing to try, he'll make it right. I was just sharing an experience I had with him via email today, so I probably send him an email every 1-2 months or so.
He'll do right by you, I'm pretty sure.

Make sure you’re on the latest version, then go to Preferences&gt;Bitcoin Settings&gt;Enable Segwit
@_date: 2018-11-18 03:07:34
1. It's opt in now because bech32 isn't used very widely by the community. If it was just turned on for very BRD user then suddenly they wouldn't be able to use it with most exchanges and ATMs. Consider yourself lucky, you're more advanced than most users.
2. There is no bias. BRD uses the BitPay exchange rate API, and BCH happens to be an option for display currency in their API. That's all it is. BCH is alongside all the other 50~ fiat currencies that are supported in their API for some reason.

I agree that I wish Segwit was sooner, but they have it now.
Regarding the other coins, you can easily hide them in the app if you don’t want to use them.

I'm a HUGE VR enthusiast, however I realize that Apple isn't losing out on much by not providing VR offerings right now.
There isn't that much content to play/watch at the moment in VR. It's still very early.
Even if Apple waits until 2020 for VR they'll still be fine, as it will have matured a lot more 3 years from now.

Without trying to pick sides too much, I will say that if a fix is coming very soon on the horizon, then for a company it's best just to use that fix that is coming. 
There are so many different aspects of the business to manage, and I assure you people like Erik aren't just twiddling their thumbs and watching YouTube videos all day.
For example some companies, after Bitcoin Cash was released, were BOMBARDED with messages of "WHY DON'T YOU SUPPORT BITCOIN CASH???" just a few days after it's hard fork. People don't realize these things take time, money, and resources.
Everything takes longer than you hoped it would, and it's not because of laziness I assure you. A lot of these developers absolutely love their work but they too need evenings and weekends off for sanity and quality of life. 
@_date: 2017-09-07 21:18:50
The amount of inputs determines the fee. If for example he had 7 inputs then at the moment a $10 fee is the reality of the situation.

@_date: 2018-02-08 20:47:36
I sincerely don't have an issue with Bitcoin Cash as a fork. I think it's fine that they forked, and I even find it interesting and it might be useful.
However, I hate that they used the name Bitcoin Cash. It's incredibly confusing for people (I know from firsthand experience). It's not even a political thing for me, it's confusing when people go to buy Bitcoin and they see Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash side by side. How are they supposed to know the difference? 
Luckily enhancements are in play and are being deployed that help avoid confusion between sending to the wrong address, but it still creates a problem. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 22:48:12
That's fine, I'm just a little surprised/impressed by your enthusiasm. You copy and paste this response in many Coinbase posts. 
@_date: 2017-09-07 15:08:36
I don't agree with an option for a wallet (that is aiming to be easy for newcomers) to give full control over fees. If that is the case they would 'all' choose 2 cent fees and complain when it takes days to confirm (in the event of a backlog)
Can you imagine the intense headache Coinbase would have if they let their users choose fees? I agree Coinbase needs more fee options, but FULL control sounds like such an intense clusterfuck that quite honestly it stresses me out to think about when you consider how many newcomers use their service.
@_date: 2018-02-08 20:52:36
It was effective at creating a higher "market cap" for the fork, I'll give them that. However I wonder if it truly didn't create value for people, and instead sucked $1k out of BTC's exchange rate and gave it to BCH for example? (today's exchange rate)
@_date: 2017-09-05 23:50:16
the horror
@_date: 2017-09-05 23:48:09
People are overly dramatic.
What do you expect these companies to do? If 90% of the hashrate goes one direction, then the majority of the industry (wallets, exchanges, etc) will follow. The only reason they wouldn't follow is if the 90% chain threatened very key elements: changing amount of 21 to 42 mil coins for example, changing block time to 1 minute, chain flat out doesn't work, etc etc.
If you're asking these companies to hypothetically pledge allegiance to a 10% chain that would drop down to a price in the hundreds instead of thousands, you're not thinking logically.
People need to stop taking this stuff personally.

But you're not understanding that there will be enough nodes for 2x to proceed, if it does happen.
You also need to understand that the market forces limits on ill fated decisions, such as "requiring an ID to send Bitcoin transactions". In that scenario the exchange rate would plummet, and a market would open up for another crypto currency to take the crown. 
@_date: 2017-10-11 15:56:50

@_date: 2017-10-01 16:40:56
Why would people lose money?
The chain that the exchanges call "Bitcoin" would have the same or greater exchange rate, and that's the chain people would invest in and use on services like Coinbase, etc.
The minority chain would barely survive and only a select few hold outs would use it, similar to Bitcoin Cash.

I don't understand why people get so political though? Look at BTC_Forever's post, he acts like we're in sort of war.
In reality last fall just sucked for everyone involved (except for the price rise, of course). The fees sucked and some (including myself) wish we would've just forked to increase the blocksize.
Alas, that's not the world we still live in and I still enjoy BTC today.

No, I'm not going to try such a thing, because when the majority of the exchanges call the majority hashrate chain "Bitcoin", out of necessity and survival - you will back out. 
Contrary to belief I don't want 2X, but I'm not blind to the reality of how it would happen IF majority hashrate occurs behind it

You're making some dangerous assumptions. Please see the corrections below:
1. It's not contentious, IF there is a 90% hashrate behind it. The network will perform just the same, and if you weren't reading Reddit you wouldn't even think something is going on.
2. They're not newly generated coins, it's a new rule set (2x aspect) that is being modified. In this instance the minority chain would the the "coins" that would most likely never get collected or sold.
3. Only the minority chain would really be exploited, if at all. Which is not a concern in regards to "losing money"
4. Not the wallets that engage with the community and are under active development. 
5. The only loss of confidence from investors will be on the minority chain because as far as they know it won't exist or be viable anymore.
6. Yes, scams will exist and continue to exist.

"NO, ELEVEN!"
"Okay please start over mam"

Sorry, I have to continue disagreeing.
If front and center you put an option that allows you to put a 5cent fee (versus let's say a "needed" one of $1.50 for 2 hours or less confirmation), then a ton of people are going to opt for the 5 cent fee.
What will happen is the user will get frustrated, get mad at Bitcoin, get mad at the wallet company, and not understand "why their transaction isn't working"
There has to be a strong guiding hand for wallets which are trying to appeal to newcomers.
This stuff is confusing as hell, and we can't expect everyone to be as interested as we are in fee calculation.
To me, it's enjoyable to go to block explorers, see the memepool, etc etc. I am the 1% in this scenario, nobody else cares to or knows how to access this information.

Amazon has 300 Million users. If only .01% (not 1%, .01%) of their users send bitcoin everyday, that's 300,000 extra transactions. The network can't handle that right now without extremely high fees.
@_date: 2017-10-27 17:44:54
People get too emotional about this stuff.
Things such as MAST and SCHORR could be implemented into 2x, and would probably we welcomed.
The whole damn reason we have 15 minute block times right now is because the core devs wouldn't do a measly upgrade to 2MB blocks.
Because of that Bitcoin cash was born, so we have instances like this where miners switch back and forth between chains. This is entirely the Core devs fault.
@_date: 2017-10-01 21:51:48
I don't want 2x happen and I don't know if it's going to happen (with majority hashrate) That said, I'm not going to be offended by it if it does occur, as it doesn't threaten any characteristics that I find valuable (such as 21 mil limit, PoW, etc).
The network effect is ruled by miners and the biggest Bitcoin businesses, and there will be enough nodes that will accept this 2x development if it does occur.
This is going to be a non event to everyone outside of message board Echo chambers. 
All that will happen (if users are with responsible wallet developers) is that all of a sudden their transactions will confirm faster, with lower fees, and they'll also have coins on a minority chain that they can hold onto, or try to sell/use/whatever before and if the chain dies.
Please, have an open mind. I'm not an idiot, you're not an idiot. If this occurs it will be boring non event, in fact the "ETF news" from this past spring will have been more volatile.
The only ones who will be stressed are the ones who insist on using a minority chain, which is what the major businesses won't do, and why the most hashrate chain will be called "Bitcoin" by the bigwigs such as Coinbase and BitPay who aren't "evil."

If you're speaking in regards to 1X coins: only if they don't care about losing them/take whichever action they choose.
@_date: 2017-10-03 20:30:50
If majority of hashrate goes one direction (in this instance 2X), then that would be what all the exchanges list as "Bitcoin"
The minority chain would take a month or more for. Difficulty readjustment, if it survives (that's without an emergency hard fork)
I'm not advocating for 2X, but don't be naive. Implementing replay protection would be to label 2x an altcoin. 
The end goal (of a hard fork such as this) is for the other chain to die, lose users, lose exchange support, etc.
The minority chain may ultimately survive, but it would be renamed to exchanges that accept it to something like "Bitcoin Legacy" (BTL)
This token would not be the coin everyone knows as Bitcoin, or what coinbase for example sells as Bitcoin.

@_date: 2018-02-13 01:01:50
“One aspect of the SPV protocol (which Bread uses) is that each time a new type of bitcoin address or signature scheme is introduced, a new chain of addresses must be monitored for transactions belonging to the user. This monitoring is resource intensive, particularly on mobile devices, and introduces long delays during app "syncing." To provide our users with the best experience possible, we have commited to aggressively pursuing an implementation of SegWit that is sufficiently mature as to not become obsolete in the foreseeable future. Once we support one chain, we will have to support it forever, and this form of technical debt does not serve the interests of our users. “
It means that in an effort for the app to be efficient (since it doesn’t connect to riskier servers which are faster), it’s not going to support multiple implementations of Segwit. They need one that has Schnorr included for example.

What is the purpose of connecting to servers with usernames/passwords in the first place? 
Is it for quicker sync times?
Also, what happens if the nodes you’re directly connected to go down? Will the app seek out other nodes on its own?
**Edit**: After reading more, I've come to the conclusion that simple username/password is used due the inability of many people to securely store their private keys themselves. This is fine, but might not be secure enough for more advanced users. I'm still curious about the questions above, however.

Who decides "what is contentious"?
You? No.
There will always be at least some that don't like a hardfork, so every hard fork will be contentious. That is why hashrate leads the way and IF 2X occurs with majority hashrate, so many of the confused individuals here will shut their mouth real quick when the only "consequence" is suddenly their transaction confirms faster.
For the 15th time on the record, I wish 2X wasn't happening.

This is the way it works. IF you have majority hashrate, then you don't need reply protection. This is the way the ecosystem was designed to work, so the less supported chain gets left behind to die.

Most ICOs (as you know) are a joke. There are/will be a few good ones, and having people who have good reputations on the team tends to help I suppose.
All in all you and I are probably a lot alike. I just really don't care who the devs are as long as the network continues to function, improves, and keeps appreciating in value.
I also think a lot of people who aren't upset with the state of the network (congestion) don't have businesses they have built for the community and are trying to grow. This congestion is a huge pain, and everyday people will (sometimes rudely) contact our businesses about the delays.
@_date: 2017-10-03 20:10:44
No, that's not the way it works.
IF 2X occurs with majority hashrate, they will not implement replay protection because that makes it an alt coin.

If 2X proposed changing limit to 42 mil coins, changing PoW, etc - you can bet that I would be outraged, and so would all the sensible businesses. 
However the proposed change, 1MB extra, is not the end of the world and this is more about particular developers having their feelings hurt because they weren't included in a meeting.

I just sincerely don't understand what value it would bring to businesses someday accepting 10+ crypto currencies. 
The reason the dollar exists is because it offers something the euro doesn't, and vice versa. With these alternate cryptos there's nothing significant enough to differentiate it from Bitcoin. When it's all said and done to 99% of people those alts will always just be a "Bitcoin clone" in their eyes with a different logo. 
@_date: 2015-04-29 17:11:24
I mainly mean from a business perspective, why certain businesses (GoCoin,shapeshift, etc) keep trying to embrace alts and make them more used?
For example Dogecoin. I really do get a good chuckle when I see Hustler accepts it, but Doge only has a $10 Million market cap. Why is GoCoin focusing on it? It's as if they want to try and get an edge on BitPay but can only come up with lackluster ideas.
I'm all for uniqueness but I'm also a numbers guy and I like trends. If Litecoin was "first" then I'd probably be behind it because it makes the most sense. 
So I think in closing I really wish you much luck. I just don't want companies to get lost in what's really important (network effect, network effect, network effect)

It would significantly confuse their customers more and risk undermine all that they've worked for.

I wouldn't worry. The people who run Bitcoin mines (which are very technical AND expensive) aren't stupid. When there is an economic incentive to do so, they will work with nodes and include more transactions per block.
@_date: 2017-10-22 01:56:12
Fascinating really. I don't condone it but those guys are stealing a lot of crypto that way 
@_date: 2017-10-03 21:24:43
Man, you love debating this. Fortunately for both of us, neither of us has too much control.
I'm tired of debating this but I'll politely respond (with cliffnotes) as you've put a lot of effort into a meaningful discussion. 
1. Yes I realize hashrate isn't consistent. Just like if 2x occurs with majority hashrate, it will have changed away from the "legacy" chain which is then the minority chain. Therefore the hashrate isn't consistent in one direction. 
2. They'll mine 2X because of herd mentality, exchange rate, and it makes no business sense to stay on a 10% chain that has to wait months for diff readjustment.
3. 2X isn't implementing replay protection, I don't know why you keep clamoring for it. They are doing it (IF 2x moves forward) to kill the other chain.
4. No, people who leave crypto on an exchange want to make sure it has the same or higher exchange rate. You're in a tiny minority who care about consensus rules. Don't try to be ignorant and think John Smith down the street wants the same consensus rules if it means he lost 50-90% of it's fiat value.
5. There will be enough nodes for 2X to take over (if it has 90% hash rate)
Don't get so emotional. Either way, you'll still have the same or higher fiat value. It's just some people might get their feelings hurt over block size. (hopefully it wouldn't be you)
@_date: 2015-04-30 15:26:52

What does circles wallet do when you scan a BitPay qr code? I've only used circle to send/receive money from friends. 
Circle doesn't say "BitPay has requested x amount of Bitcoins"?
Instead circle says "BitPay is requesting x amount of dollars?

Man I don’t know how many times I’m going to have his conversation with you. BRD is an SPV wallet. To this day, there are no SPV wallets available anywhere that support Segwit (on iOS and Android)
There are valid reasons for this, and it will occur when Schnorr signatures are in play.
@_date: 2015-04-29 16:51:43
I'm all for competition but I think having all of these alts is a bit silly. This isn't about "teams", it's about reality. If the average person decides to use crypto there's no reason for them to use any other coin over Bitcoin.
It just baffles me, is all.

It's not necessary to worry.
The people running miners/nodes are doing so as major operations, as major investments. They watch the network like their financial life depends on it.
When there is a financial incentive to do so the miners will act accordingly.

You honestly believe, after this many replies in, that I would think "Bitcoin could be sued"?
Have a little more faith in the people you debate.
It's in the exchanges best interest to protect the amount of money people hold (when you multiply the crypto against the fiat exchange rate)
It is much riskier to try following the minority chain, and you know it. 
@_date: 2018-07-17 21:17:29
No - fees are extremely confusing and easy to get wrong, even for those who use bitcoin daily.
99% of people who use crypto don’t know how to calculate fees, so it’s not an option.
For the 1% who understand fees there are other wallets to use with custom options (but you’ll find that it’s usually not necessary)
Hope this was helpful, wish you well

It’s because BRD is an SPV wallet. There are no SPV wallets on jos or android that have Segwit.
No, Samourai is not an SPV wallet, as stated by the developers.
There is a reason for this, and it will all change when schnorr signatures come into play. 
@_date: 2017-10-02 12:54:24
Exactly. IF 2X happens with majority hashrate, good luck with your "ideals" on a minority chain when the exchange rate plummets and the chain dies or undergoes another hardfork. In addition, the minority chain wouldn't be called "Bitcoin" by the exchanges.
@_date: 2018-02-06 01:41:36
Goodness, can the most upvoted post be any more childish?
@_date: 2019-09-15 08:20:02
This is incorrect. BRD connects to random nodes. It’s in the source code.
@_date: 2018-07-18 05:56:46
SPV can implement Segwit, but if it's done before Schnorr takes place it means there is an additional address chain that has to be supported. (syncing and resource intensive on a mobile device)
Once an address chain is supported it has to be supported forever. (in the app)

Why do you even accept Bitcoin then? If your sales are going to rise 6%~ upon removing Bitcoin acceptance....then just do it. It would be common sense. 
You don't owe us or the community and favors. I'm not trying to be rude-it's just the truth. 
Personally I don't believe your revenue would go up 6% when removing the Bitcoin checkout option. I also don't believe Mozilla's 'study' is anything close to conclusive. Most likely what they were seeing was more people like me who went to see if the checkout option was there, but didn't have the desire to donate. Personally in that time period I went there twice (on my computer and phone) to see what it looked likeZ
@_date: 2018-07-18 05:55:06
Thanks for the reply.
When they were the same (regular and economy) this meant that fees were as low as they could go at that time (network wasn't congested). The app has since been improved so it goes much lower (when the network isn't congested)
There have been many wallet companies that have gone out of business over the years due to lack of resources. BRD does not plan to be one of those companies, and plans to be here for decades. The BRD token was instrumental in setting the groundwork for their rewards program and also funding additional development for more features.

@_date: 2018-07-15 22:14:19
Therefore there are no SPV wallets on android and iOS that support Segwit for a reason, and it’s not laziness.

This is true.
It is only helped (somewhat) if Edge makes 2FA mandatory (right now it's optional). 
Otherwise, everyone using their wallet is prone to username/password attacks which as you pointed out are a higher risk.

Thank you Voorhees for the response.
I really do wish you much luck (I hope you know that) I just want you to be careful in protecting the "scarcity" image of Cryptos to the world. When I see Shapeshift accepting Potcoin with a $150k market cap it seems like they're not really vetting these coins or taking the network effect very seriously at all. We (the community) in my opinion have to keep the options few to protect the perceived image of scarcity.

@_date: 2015-04-30 14:17:25

You just said “The biggest threat to bitcoin is BitPay”
That’s highly inflammatory, and then you don’t even get all of the facts straight when you create your thread.
There’s no need to be so hostile. The reason they chose to make this mandatory is because so many people don’t understand exactly how Bitcoin works, and would send the wrong amounts. This prevents these people from accidentally sending the wrong amounts

@_date: 2017-10-23 14:55:40
I won't downvote because I disagree (even though I do) 
This is honestly just about a group of developers who are having their feeling hurt because for once THEIR say might not be "law". (I'm not for or against 2X by the way, I embrace whatever the market values after/if a fork occurs)
The extra 1MB isn't that big of a deal, just like you said.
The protection of Bitcoin is based in its exchange rate. If all these "Jamie Dimons" decided that you need an ID to send a Bitcoin transaction someday, the exchange rate would plummet, hence the protection of the basic abilities of the protocol.
At "worst" if 2X occurs you'll have transactions that don't confirm faster, but transactions that do have lower fees.
@_date: 2019-09-27 19:29:56
This requires physical access to the device. That means the threat isn’t that significant

I really am not trying to sound big headed by saying that... I just don't understand why (some) don't get this?
If there was no financial incentive for securing the network...then the blockchain could be very easily modified with the cheapest of computers...hence it wouldn't be secure in the least bit.
It's common sense.

When these people are making these types of deals do they even know what Dogecoin is or recognize that it has a $10 Million Dollar market cap? For crying out loud my grandfather (god rest his soul) had $1Million to his name when he died. He's just one guy and his assets were 1/10th of dogecoin's market cap.
Why do they even bother?

Of course, so I think actually you and I are on similar pages.
I just think it would be a negative for the community if we went to Overstock and saw a "pay with shapeshift" option, then a pull down menu of 100 cryptos appears.

Dude, that is so sad. How on earth is he running that company?
Using DogeCoin and Litecoin is a failed attempt at trying to take business from BitPay and the likes. They should focus on more tangible plans.
@_date: 2015-04-30 16:46:09
I just downloaded the iOS app to test it and it works perfectly. I scanned a BitPay QR code and the BTC amount was filled into the invoice I had to pay. Worked perfectly.

It's not really worth stressing about. I'm sure it'll happen eventually but as of now there hasn't been one verifiable report of BTC being stolen in Breadwallet (I spend 1-2 hrs a day browsing multiple Bitcoin forums)
@_date: 2015-04-29 02:38:29
I feel bad for people working on these projects who truly believe it has a shot.
Goodness gracious, so much wasted "talent". There's nothing significant that this alt can do which Bitcoin can't (in the eyes of consumers and businesses)

I personally don't know. There's only 2 things I'm absolutely sure of: the "fee" attached to the transaction was sufficient, and it wasn't the fault of the wallet.
Needless to say the funds aren't lost.

It's just silly behavior, regardless of where it's posted.
Somebody did the same a month ago, burning BitPay cards and posting pictures. It's idiotic.
@_date: 2015-04-09 03:23:59
I kinda stopped worrying about merchant adoption in the US and decided to just go with the flow on that aspect.
I just spend Bitcoin at merchants, (2~ times a week). Gyft, overstock, CardFlip, etc)
When/if it happens to pickup I'll be happy. In the meantime there are lots of different use cases worldwide for the Bitcoin network :)
@_date: 2015-09-24 13:58:50
This cardcash issue is separate though (I know exactly what you're talking about, went back and forth with support 2 weeks ago about orders not completing)
CardCash is okay now, this is merely BitPays invoices not working correctly 
@_date: 2015-09-27 19:40:55
They have for about 6~ months now.
@_date: 2015-04-12 18:45:44
Someone else might know the answer.
Honestly in my sincere opinion if it's not an insane amount of money I suggest trying Breadwallet on iOS. It's the most secure mobile wallet to date. (Disclaimer, I'm an investor in that company)
@_date: 2018-07-17 21:07:38
The fee estimation right now for BRD is 6 sat/byte for an hour confirmation. It is not “horrible” and matches network conditions.
There are no SPV wallets that have Segwit, and there is a reason for that. (No, Samourai is not SPV - their devs have told us this)
Once Schnorr is in play, then Segwit will come to brd. 
@_date: 2015-04-10 00:39:18
What the hell? Why would they do this? 
@_date: 2015-04-08 23:36:47
Sorry I don't know. I'm on a mac and installing is just as easy as deleting the program.

It's always been technically possible with BitPay
@_date: 2015-09-15 01:44:05
That makes no sense, they only list Amazon products.

There hasn't been a block found in an hour. This is not something that wallets can control.
@_date: 2015-04-29 17:44:40
You and I are thinking with different mindsets:
You: someone who's incredibly passionate about crypto
Me: someone who's taking off that hat for this conversation and thinking like a normal joe 
If somehow I, Joe, begin to think about saving/using crypto I'm going to go with the most popular one 99% of the time. Joe doesn't care about block times, if another one has 100billion units, if another one can mask his transactions on the network.
He doesn't care. That's why I feel it's incredibly risky (on top of Bitcoin being risky) to invest funds into an alt for long term. The fact that this fear is there gives Bitcoin an enormous real world advantage-nobody will want to risk holding the alt that hardly anyone is holding. 
@_date: 2015-09-24 00:06:45
Yes. Over a year ago they accepted BTC for a few weeks, then stopped.
They have now resumed.
@_date: 2015-09-10 15:08:01
In my opinion (which could be wrong), say the BTC price today is $250. The exchange rate won't just stay at $250 when the block reward halves, and then halves again.
IF the network is useful to certain industries then the exchange rate will rise as BTC becomes more scarce.
@_date: 2015-04-15 16:59:23
Which card gives you 5% back?
@_date: 2015-04-23 00:16:14

I don't support them or shop with them because their website is incredibly frustrating. 
On top of it being incredibly slow, they only price items in BTC...which even as an extreme bitcoin advocate it essentially means nothing to me because of daily fluctuations. I always would have to go into preev and type in .0081921 for example
@_date: 2017-10-06 15:00:08
All I can say for you, is *IF* 2X occurs with 90% hash rate, you better not be ignorant enough to try "riding it out" on a minority chain, because it isn't going to work, and that chain is going to die from lack of support. I don't care how many "nodes" you have which can be easily manipulated.
@_date: 2016-10-09 19:14:59
You're in the minority then, because this thread has 700+ up votes.
I know what I'm talking about, this is the same person (or group of people) who made shitty breadwallet forks a couple months ago and called the wallets "breadwallet" "blockchain.info" "greenaddress" and people were getting their money stolen and reporting it here. 
This wallet is the same shitty fork, with the same crappy descriptions, I AM doing good for the community.

Literally, with ALL the respect in the world possible towards you - as someone who works in conjunction with Bitcoin startups .... you've lost your way (if you've ever had it). You're too determined with "being right" that you never stopped to think that you might actually be the one that's in the wrong.
@_date: 2017-10-27 04:46:04
IF 2X moves forward with majority hashrate, the only "consequence" is your fees will be lower and shorter wait times.
Everybody here is too damn emotional. These aren't "backroom deals" that will result in needing an ID to send a BTC transaction someday. The market will prevent this.
Stop whining so much.
@_date: 2016-10-20 01:02:39
I'm in the same exact boat, an hour ago I sent from Circle and I don't see the transaction has even been broadcast 
@_date: 2018-04-03 14:33:44
I think it speaks volumes about the maturity of certain dev teams. While some see Bitcoin Cash and call it a “BCash Scam!!!”, others see an alt coin that will either survive or fail depending on if its adopted by the market. They don’t have time for big political posturing, and are too busy working.
@_date: 2015-04-30 14:41:36
No, Coinbase just allows you to hold USD in your account which you can convert to BTC when you wish.
Circle allows you to have a "Dollar Account" that holds it's value in dollars while it's in your circle wallet, but it can still be sent to any BTC address you wish.
@_date: 2016-10-01 16:55:27
Wow, OneCoin the future, our great leader. 
@_date: 2018-04-03 03:03:59
They’re not “compromised”, and they have valid reasons for waiting to implement Segwit support for an SPV wallet:

An app can't break your phone, especially on iOS.
@_date: 2016-10-18 01:04:53
Why are all your transactions so big? I send transactions all the time and they're 2-3 times smaller than yours 
@_date: 2018-04-03 05:40:16
Devil's advocate: why is Samourai praised as "more secure" than other wallets (such as SPV ones) even though by default it makes you to connect to their own personal node?
99% of people won't even try to change it. That pretty much negates the fact that it gives you the option to change the node.
@_date: 2018-07-15 20:31:06
Samourai is not SPV. In fact the developers have even tweeted saying it is not 
@_date: 2015-04-08 03:41:37
Like I said-miners and nodes, and yes miners can choose how many transactions to put into a block.
@_date: 2015-11-08 06:40:08
Makes sense.
Technically is it hard for circle to automate a scenario like this: user wants to send BTC out. Circle transfers that BTC into an address under their wallet, then from there sends the BTC transaction out of Circle.
Would that be hard to implement? I feel like they'll have to do this sooner or later or else run into tons of frustrated customers who think that there are "from" addresses.

They did not choose Segwit2x. You never linked to any proof.
If it had more hash power, then why didn't it become the longest chain?
It just goes to show that people get too emotional here. They need to take a breath, discuss with each other, and remove some of this hostility. 
@_date: 2017-10-06 14:55:02
You were cursing at me, and I don't appreciate it.
None of us are "evil". We're just normal people you'd see getting groceries with their kids on a Sunday evening.
We're however not risking going down with a shipping sink over a stupid 1MB disagreement.
If 90% of miners proposed changing outstanding coin limit to 42 million coins, or changing PoW, then of COURSE we'd be against it.
But instead we're acting rationally and recognizing the whole world isn't going to end over 1MB.
This is only a case of some developers getting their feelings hurt, and then rallying a message board filled with people who don't understand what a rational fear is. I get it, we all get our feelings hurt sometimes. But eventually when that occurs we need to move past it and grow up.
@_date: 2015-04-24 16:05:39

Over the past 2-3 months I've helped expose just about 20 scam wallets on iOS (check my post history). (Or search iOS scam wallet on this subreddit)
They all share very similar characteristics, just two days ago a wallet just like this, with a different description, was taken off the iOS store due to it being a scam. 
I can almost assure you if you try this wallet, you will get screwed over at some point as others have in the past with fake wallets that were just like this. 
The description says "Copyright BTC Wallet" for example - it's a scam, stay away.

Thank you for the response.
I monitor posts on Reddit and Samourai is VERY highly praised for security/privacy when by default it couldn't be further from the truth. People just see these upvoted posts and then download the app thinking they are "taking the most secure route".
In my opinion, people's misunderstanding about their tech is mainly influenced by their "WE FIGHT FOR THE USERS!" types of tweets that they post and are shared on this message board. It's the easy bait to get people "riled up" and think that they're supporting something great.

There's been 20+ wallets that are poor forks of breadwallet that have been removed from the store. They all share either the same description of the wallet, such as "...arguably the most secure!" Or list "Bit Coin" as the seller/developer.
You're really going to risk your money in these wallets? The ones that were up for a while, back at the end of summer, were stealing Bitcoin with reports on Reddit.

The only thing in my opinion that doesn't make sense of yours is this: 
"Stop trying to explain why the price is going up. There is almost no reason that it should be mooning right now, which should tell you that this is very likely just irrational exuberance. Many of you will be given to it. You will dump your money in, exacerbate the bubble, and we will see a rash of news reports, more and more people will pour in, and more and more money will be on chain. It will be good for Bitcoin, as it will bring with it a large number of new beliebers. But it won't be easy when we hit another long lull where Bitcoin sits for a long period of time at some small number."
There are very significant reasons, a few being that over a Billion has been invested into Bitcoin firms this year alone, and many are waking up to the privileges that Bitcoin brings. 
Bitcoin is worth just shy of $6 Billion. That is **nothing** in the grand scheme of things. It's basically pennies.

What's the endgame? Sincere question.
If nobody budges, then do on chain transactions balloon up to $10/fee average in 5 years, and off chain scaling solutions take hold that don't require Segwit ?

breadwallet on iOS and android (in terms of secure mobile phone wallets)

Makes sense. Like if you're paid in Bitcoin for example, or receive it for remittance.

I tend to agree but also don't forget VR. It's really amazing with consumer launches coming in 6~ months.
In 9 years we'll literally have VR displays that have the visual fidelity of real life (can't see pixels, doesn't look like you're looking at a screen) Sure the PROCESSING hardware for graphics might not look like 'real life' in 9 years but it will be amazing.

Some version of the NY plan. It's much preferred compared to trying a UASF

It does require support from the miners. If a UASF is attempted it will not work and none of the major businesses that matter will follow it.

The BRD app allows you to send transactions out of your wallet and to a bech32 address!

Just wait it out. It's all you can really do. Once you don't see the tx id showing up in multiple block explorers, try to send again. Or it might confirm - don't know for sure.

1. No, Credit Card transactions take days if not weeks or months to settle for merchants. Bitcoin doesn't compete with Credit Cards, anyways. 
@_date: 2015-11-08 05:59:53
In a way there is a "from" address of sorts when it comes to wallet like breadwallet - because it's deterministic and no matter what you can always receive back Bitcoin to any address that you've sent from before. 
@_date: 2015-11-10 04:25:53
I didn't realize this was a fully implemented thing on MovieTickets.com 
Thought it was only a promotion for the movie, "Dope"?

With all sincerity, you're "safe enough" with a wallet like breadwallet on your phone. Yes, technically there are more secure hardware solutions. But breadwallet uses hardware level encryption, and has never had a hacking incident

You have to share the ID. With a fee that high, it absolutely would've confirmed a longggg time ago unless one of your inputs (money you've received) isn't confirmed yet

I recommend Breadwallet as someone who uses Bitcoin 2-3 times a week for purchases. What initially brought me to the app was it's simplicity and UI design.
@_date: 2017-05-18 04:23:03
Hardforks are not risky with consensus, if you've been told this you've been misinformed. 
@_date: 2017-05-05 16:21:57
You're leaving out the size of the transaction (in bytes)
Without all the information your post doesn't mean anything 
@_date: 2017-05-03 15:44:36
that fee was wayyyy too high (in my opinion). You could've gotten away with 165 satoshis/byte and been included within 1-3 blocks.
@_date: 2017-05-16 13:57:51
There's the reality of a situation, and then there's hope. Hope is "man, Bitcoin isn't what I wanted it to be, gosh darn that makes me mad! We gotta rally together and do something."
You're not going to have these major businesses take even MORE risk with a chain that has to do a PoW change. It's TOO risky, most of these companies have limited financial runway (limited burn rate) and can't "wait around and test a PoW change" 
Trust me, I'm conflicted on what the best path is for bitcoin, I'm human, and I'm not a "bad" person.
But Bitcoin is risky enough as it is, we (businesses) can't pin our hopes on a PoW change. We have real businesses that employ real people in a field that is already experimental. We're not going to "cross our fingers" and hope. We'll follow the economy, and the economy is with the miners. I don't care if 50% or 60% of miners are in china - they've become that way because they were competing and became the best. 
@_date: 2017-05-17 20:06:59

@_date: 2015-03-09 23:37:13
Sorry you're not very smart when it comes to this stuff and how it works:
1. Centralization of miners won't be a problem, an attack on the network is an attack on their bread and butter.
2. It doesn't matter what type of "math" you want it to use, it works already.
3. Of course it has to be finite to create value.
4. It's very expensive and difficult/stupid to initiate at 50% attack.
5. You have to monetize it, nobody will secure the Blockchain "out of their good hearts"
@_date: 2015-11-06 21:54:33

Yes, this is true. However it's literally (in my opinion) throwing away money because it is impossible to help finance a successful campaign.

It looks like Breadwallet currently doesn't support that bank it seems

Amazon is one of the biggest companies and their fraud prevention team are doing just fine. 
Who the hell buys Amazon gift cards with a stolen credit card to purchase BTC off purse for a 25% premium. Makes no sense. 
They're better off just buying the BTC off purse with the credit card in that case. 
@_date: 2015-10-30 21:43:26
For the record, 6 confirmations isn't needed in my opinion. Not that much risk involved. 
@_date: 2017-05-08 00:03:29
use breadwallet. It's way better at determining the fee that's necessary.

Thank you. I was looking at this on the link you sent:
*"Batwallet assigns an address mgzdqkEjYEjR5QNdJxYFnCKZHuNYa5bUZ2+mb7vCiK to Bob, and Bob gives this address to Alice.*
*Alice now logs onto Asiawallet and requests to send 0.01 BTC to mgzdqkEjYEjR5QNdJxYFnCKZHuNYa5bUZ2+mb7vCiK
*Asiawallet looks as the address and sees the  domain. If Asiawallet already has a Moonbeam channel open to Batwallet, the payment is sent over this channel. If not, Asiawallet can send it directly to mgzdqkEjYEjR5QNdJxYFnCKZHuNYa5bUZ2. In either case, Alice and Bob quickly conclude their payment."*
**edit: if a transaction is sent to a  address, how does the user on the other end get actual bitcoin that isn't on an  address? I'm speaking in regards to wallets where users hold the private keys**
**I appreciate your help**

@_date: 2017-05-03 22:58:58
The fee is around 90 satoshis/byte. It should've been around 160 satoshis/byte.
Use wallets that calculate the fee for you, such as breadwallet

Or newegg, tiger direct, or overstoxk 
@_date: 2017-05-16 14:17:21
I agree (except for the dying part). Even if Bitcoin NEVER scaled (in my opinion) then Bitcoin would survive. Too many smart people out there, would create inventive ways for off chain transactions that get bunched up together on the main chain. 
@_date: 2017-05-28 18:00:42
breadwallet on iOS/android. It's much safer 
@_date: 2017-05-24 13:10:02
breadwallet because it's the most secure, hasn't had a hacking incident yet
@_date: 2015-10-28 15:37:35
breadwallet is the way to go!
@_date: 2015-10-13 02:36:18
Just be polite yet let them know what you wish to do. If you really want to spend Bitcoin directly just let them know you're looking for a dealer who will accept it.
If they say no than be polite and say thank you. I'm guessing eventually if you were outright paying $30k worth someone would work with you.
@_date: 2017-05-30 16:35:57
the reason you get slow syncing sometimes, is because breadwallet connects directly to the bitcoin network. (unlike other wallets, which have servers that can get hacked or go down)
per their recent blog post, they'll support the longest chain. (aka the chain that will have the most users)
@_date: 2017-05-09 00:14:43
I mean no disrespect at all (I actually wish you a lot of luck) but the fact that you're asking this question on reddit means you're probably going to have a tough road ahead in wallet development. 
@_date: 2015-10-28 21:51:05
Haha :)
Glad things are getting better.
It has been fun to me troubleshooting with support so future customer's experiences go smoother. I'm a dork so I enjoy this stuff - when a new merchant accepts and it's a product I want then I try to help them if there are glitches along the way :)

@_date: 2017-05-15 04:32:48
don't know where they're coming from. bread is on iOS and Android. On Android it's literally the most secure bitcoin wallet, because it's the only one that requires Marshmallow 6.0 and above. It stores "your bitcoin" in a secure place on your phone where no other malware infected apps can steal your bitcoin.
there's no "1st party apps" for buying bitcoin unless you use one like Coinbase, which stores the bitcoin on their servers.
I've used the wallet since 2014, don't let trolls sway you negatively. For crying out loud, there's a review that says there's a "$75 fee" for using the wallet. It's not true at all.
@_date: 2015-11-02 05:38:15
were they all in a row like that when you got there? just curious :)
@_date: 2016-05-19 01:36:23
I would, because it's a major consumer wallet. The risk of a company like Circle sending a transaction that won't be confirmed is so low that it's not worth worrying about.
@_date: 2017-05-22 01:59:10
What are you talking about FFS , we're at $2,022
@_date: 2015-03-15 03:58:25
You don't have to trust Apple, because the devs of Breadwallet have vetted it, and it's legit (I trust them, and others in the community). I spend (for better or worse) 1 to 2 hours a day on this subreddit and there has never been an legitimate incident of someone's Breadwallet being stolen. 
This is why future android wallets are going to be made using Rivetz.com, which is in layman's terms installing the wallet on a seperate "chunk" of your phone's storage which is separate from android os.
I'm not saying put your BTC savings on your phone if it's a big chunk, but spending money there's no need to worry at all :)

Will they ALWAYS be legit? Nobody can ever give you that answer.

Breadwallet handles payment links (BitPay, Coinbase, etc) perfectly. He just needs to delete some wallets on his phone until a BitPay link opens Breadwallet, and he's all good!

Hi Luke,
While I don't agree with a lot that you say, I respect you.
This is the conclusion I've come to regarding UASF and if it occurs (rational conclusions):
1. It will work/be accepted by the community which includes miners. 
2. It won't work and will be ignored by the majority of miners.
If  occurs, then to think that the majority chain will be ignored by the community is madness. One such as yourself cannot just say "We are the users, we decide what Bitcoin is" with mere nodes - that's not how it works, and I would ask you to be honest. 
The miners DO have a voice - they're not just peasants that do the bidding of the code forced upon them - they do have a choice, and Coinbase, etc etc will not follow the minority chain (hash rate) in any situation.
I ask you to be honest. We have businesses and families to feed - to think that we're all just going to use the minority chain because the majority chain "isn't what I personally wanted" is madness. 
@_date: 2017-05-05 03:42:02
I understand the reasons (Bitcoin nerd), I just don't understand all of the 5 star reviews they get (I follow Bitcoin and this subreddit extensively - people always say to stay away)

Pretty level headed response he had, despite being kinda confused about what Bitcoin is.
@_date: 2017-05-30 18:42:47
is the percentage meter moving at all in breadwallet? that means progress is being made.
how do you see it in other wallets, are you typing your recovery phrase into other wallets?
@_date: 2017-05-24 13:36:44
Fees will be high no matter what wallet you use, especially if you've received more than a few transactions to your wallet. 
Every wallet is experiencing this.

@_date: 2017-05-22 16:31:47
No worries.
Honestly, if it's only been an hour, just wait. In the future use wallets that calculate the fee for you, like breadwallet. 
I don't know how that business is setup, so wait UNTIL you have a confirmation, and then contact the business a few hours after the confirmation if you think that normally you should have the item by then. A kind email will do.
@_date: 2017-05-05 19:57:07
That is not a "surrender". Be civil, please.
One side wants "unlimited" blocks. The other side wants a more restrained approach.
A 2MB hard fork + Segwit is a much more restrained approach.
@_date: 2017-05-10 04:10:54
ugh, old as hell
@_date: 2017-05-16 13:40:19
It's a self feeding loop. You're not going to have these major businesses (Coinbase, Bitstamp, etc etc) take the risk with this 'little renegade UASF' that tries to fork because some people are unhappy with the miner's decisions.
It's not going to happen, trust me. It sounds good for a movie script (the little guy sticking it to "the man!") but it's not going to play out this way.

Please reply to my thoughts if you have the time.
@_date: 2017-05-02 21:17:55
I appreciate your response, can we continue this convo?
Is this essentially only good for businesses? (not saying thats a bad thing)
Let's say I want to send you some bitcoin - would/could we use something like moonbeam, or would we need to do just a traditional bitcoin transaction? 
Or could wallet providers partner up with reputable companies that provide moonbeam channels for them? I suppose I'm trying to learn/understand how much "trust" we'd need to put into a moonbeam channel, versus how when I send a bitcoin transaction I don't feel like I need to trust anyone - I know that there is incentive for the miner to accept my transaction.
If I'm understanding correctly - I can't send a transaction to a friend on a moonbeam channel, and expect them to receive bitcoins on the other end. They would receive "moonbeam tokens" for lack of a better word.
@_date: 2015-03-14 18:32:12
It's because outside of traditional investments (stocks, real estate, etc) you've never really had a reason to save units of a currency as there is no limit to them and they continually devalue.
@_date: 2016-05-02 22:45:02
Very cool.
@_date: 2017-05-17 17:21:24
Wonderful! Compromises need to be made on BOTH sides, and no, Segwit alone is not a compromise.

.... are you listening to what I'm saying? I know all about fees, I follow 21.co like it's a religion - I've invested in several Bitcoin startups. When I wake up, I look at the fee market. Before I go to sleep, I look at the fee market.
The fees have gotten too high as of the past week because the Bitcoin price keeps rising, and wallets aren't modifying their fees downwards. What used to be a $1 fee is now a $1.25 fee, solely because of the price rise, and not because of even more of a backlog
@_date: 2017-05-03 02:54:25
for android, get breadwallet. it's the most secure wallet because it's the only one that requires marshmallow 6.0 and above. (long story short it stores your "keys" to your bitcoin in a place where no other program can access them)
If you use a wallet on android that works on versions of Android below 6.0, you put yourself at unnecessary risk

If the UASF happens without majority hashrate, it will all fall apart.
I love bitcoin but I'm also a realist, the market will follow the money, and the money is with the hashrate. You're not going to have the business community follow the less secure chain that is worth less. I don't care what Luke or others say (and no, I'm not picking a "fight". I'm also not on a side)

@_date: 2017-05-20 22:10:57
Because the minority hashrate chain's difficulty adjustment - it's a self feeding loop that rational miners will leave that chain - and join the chain with majority hashrate. 
Then I've heard the argument of (I'm not saying if you've made this argument) "Ok, if the difficulty adjustment takes too long then we'll fork again, or we'll do a PoW change".
Would you sincerely think that these rational business leaders are going to take a chance in an already risky market on a chain that's going to fork again, or even a riskier PoW change. It doesn't make any sense.
The majority of the community follows the majority hashrate chain. The ONLY reason the majority of the community wouldn't do so is IF the chain was severely "broken" or created severe distrust regarding the following: the amount of coins in circulation/created, REDUCED block size, and other privacy endangering features that are easy for the general public to understand. 
I once was told by someone that I was wrong about something, and that I would be humbled by it. Guess what, I was wrong about something - and was humbled.
You are a good person, but you too will have that moment soon if you try this UASF without majority hashrate support.
Besides, this "community" you speak of, while they're good people, couldn't even tell you how to calculate a transaction fee. Most have no idea what they're talking about, and only follow ideas that "sound cool."
They're not the ones dedicating hardware worth $100s of millions of dollars to a project, and money always talks. It's the voting mechanism for Bitcoin.

I just don't see how we can go on (smoothly) with this hostility between different parties. The miners aren't "evil", they're running a business (have met a couple), and I believe that their voices should be heard too.
We need a scenario that makes everyone content, but at the same time one side isn't like "hahaha sucker, you succumbed to MY desires".

Exactly. There is no fight against "the man" here.

@_date: 2016-05-02 00:00:33
In my opinion don't think about it too much. Honestly probably 90% of Bitcoiners today denominate their BTC in dollars, so they say "I have $50 of Bitcoin"
Nobody talks about denominations of Bitcoin unless they're talking about larger amounts or just being technical. They'll say "I have 5 Bitcoins saved up!" Or "I'm halfway to a whole Bitcoin!"
Nobody today says "I have .003278 Bitcoin!" Or I have 1,000,000 Bits." 
It's just a process. In my opinion even when people are extremely familiar with Bitcoin and it's appreciated many years from now, they'll either denominate it in their local currency or Bits (because it will be easier)
@_date: 2015-02-20 00:39:29
Today I literally had my first issue. Tried to acquire $500 worth of BTC from Circle and got caught up in their "identity verifier" thing a mabobber. They said they'll get back to me in a few days, my purchase was cancelled.

@_date: 2015-03-10 18:28:05
I don't think I need to because of what I stated earlier: Mining operations are a major business. Highly technical endeavors with very expensive equipment. When there is a financial incentive to do so, the miners will process larger blocks.

presumably because they don't want people who have no idea what they're doing to try something such as typing random numbers/IP addresses, etc in there.
it's something that maybe 1/2 of 1% of their users would use anyways - it's mainly meant to please the power users who seek out this information in the first place.

An hour isn't too long, considering the backlog of transactions. 
I would start with the vendor before BitPay.
Bitcoin isn't perfect. Right now it's relatively cheap for payments of $50 and up.
Even for a $10 item, the fee is on average $1, so while it's 10%, it's not the end of the word.
But yes, right now it's better for bigger payments :)

@_date: 2016-10-04 21:06:02
It's a good service, and when there are annoying problems (I've made 65 purchases, it happens sometimes) the support guys usually respond quick. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 04:53:00
I understand how fees work.
Today at one point, even with only 35k backlog, the fees were MUCH higher than needed, and it's because the wallets weren't lowering their fees even though the price of Bitcoin keeps rising.
We've seen this scenario play out before (rising btc price, temporarily higher fees)
And yes, I'm aware of the scaling debate 
@_date: 2015-03-11 17:50:16

The saddest thing was the vast majority wouldn't have a debate on Bitcoin in your subreddit. Without sounding arrogant I can confidently say I understand much more about how Bitcoin works than the majority, yet they'd say something COMPLETELY false about BTC and call ME rude when I corrected them.
It is pure ignorance. 
I'm happy that you can think for yourself.

Thank you for the reply.
If you've received 260+ Five star reviews in 5~ days ... where are the written reviews?
You must sense that something isn't right here? I'm not even accusing you of something - you seem trustworthy with your track record.
But I know how the App Store works - this many people do not review AND not leave a text review behind...
...something is not right here, I hope that you can see this. Somebody, or some group, is bombarding the app with perfect reviews. It's not typical of a person to leave a review without the text on the Apple App Store.

They're working on a lower fee option for a future update.
giving people complete control over fees is a huge headache since people don't know how to calculate fees. For direct control over fees there are wallets that are for more advanced users.
@_date: 2017-07-29 15:34:38
if it's an Android 6.0 or higher, and it's a wallet like breadwallet that uses the secure enclave, then it's safe enough.
I don't think any other wallet on Android does this besides breadwallet.
@_date: 2017-05-09 00:44:31
Circle.com did what you're proposing, until they stopped offering Bitcoin support. You could switch to a "USD" account. So if you deposited $50 worth of Bitcoin on May 1st, then May 5th that Bitcoin was only worth $45, you still had $50 in your account that you could send out as Bitcoin.
Wish you luck!

@_date: 2015-03-12 00:06:23
I'd say just use the fee man, it's like 11 bits and a much higher probability of the transaction getting "all good" quickly. I think 11 bits is like 1/10th of a penny or something?

For the record, I deleted this thread out of respect to you. However, other wallet developers are rolling their eyes at the claim that those are legit reviews. It's not even jealously, it's just the realization that it's a sad day when the very thought of non-organic reviews is considered and attempted. 
@_date: 2017-07-02 19:06:39
I'm not trying to be rude to the team (dev team of blockchain) but I've followed reviews/installs for pretty much all the wallets over the past four years (don't ask why, it's a stupid hobby), and I've never seen a legitimate rush of real reviews that have come in this fast and THIS positive.
200~ Five Star reviews in less than 4 days? It does not seem genuine. I suspect that someone is paying for reviews, even if you are not aware.
To add to this (I mean no disrespect, I'm only using it for data purposes) Blockchain.info is almost always never recommended on Reddit for users due to past issues which I don't wish to get into.

@_date: 2015-02-04 04:53:04
You don't, because you're unable to focus on the things that truly matter. You also falsely see some things as a problem when they are not.
Doge's 1 minute block time is at an expense of security and and doesn't help in the facilitation on trade. You need to understand when something is "good enough" plus has first mover advantage. That is Bitcoin. Typically most trade done over the Bitcoin network don't even need to worry about a confirmation. Because of several reasons not limited to: online purchase that has to be shipped anyways, merchant using a processor, most lacking the technical knowledge-desire-capital to try a double spend. 
You are right, nobody does care because when the time is right and all these consumer applications are built on the Bitcoin Blockchain, they won't need to care. They'll just say, "Cool, I need to send $50 using Bitcoin". They won't say "I need to send .008373BTC." That will all be data in the background.
Maybe someday when BTC becomes stable at a very high exchange rate you'll see someone pricing something in Bits.
I'm not trying to be a jerk, I'm just being realistic. When it comes to this subject you don't understand what matters and what doesn't. There's a reason all the talk of major investments, ETFs, etc etc is about BTC. Doing the same thing with Doge would dilute the value of all of these endeavors, and it doesn't make any sense especially when it doesn't offer any significant advantages.
@_date: 2017-05-18 04:44:56

@_date: 2015-02-04 06:41:10
I'm not arguing or trying to appear that way, but I will say market cap is a pretty significant deal. If someone wants to move/sell/buy $1Million worth of Doge it's a big deal, creates a lot of waves. $1Million is nothing in today's world. However if someone wants to do the same on BTC it makes a lot fewer waves. 
We can't have billion dollar companies investing millions into a crypto project where the market cap is so low, it doesn't make sense (just like millions weren't invested in BTC years ago)
Anywho, I wish you well.

Huh? I'm not angry with B&amp;N, I just think they were being silly. I offered to buy the book for a very reasonable price (a price that every online retailer is listing it for) and they didn't accept my offer, they said they don't price match.
Like I said, I'm not angry (sorry if it seemed that way). It just seems really silly on their part to not price match. Over half the battle (literally) is getting someone INTO their store, and they still failed to acquire me as a customer when they had an item I wanted.
I've personally had several instances where Wal-Mart always price-matched. I of course would use reputable sites though (NewEgg, Best Buy, etc) for the pricing. Not BobsElectronics.com
...and you're mistaken to think that I believe the ONLY reason Wal-Mart is in business is because they price matching. You took that sentence quite literally.

Nice try. Let me educate you as you obviously have no idea what you're talking about.
It doesn't matter if Bitcoin took 1 Computer or a billion to secure the Blockchain, as long as it can survive and turn a profit for majority of miners then it's none of your business what people do with their time and money. It is immensely efficient, and it's the first time the world has had a protocol of this nature where we have something FINITE, and a lawmaker with a pen can do nothing about it. It can grow as large or small as the people of the world decides. 
It's more efficient than a Visa. With BTC the receiver can know for a FACT that they have their funds in approx 10 minutes. Compare this to days or weeks of older methods.
Get with the times, forgive any spelling errors on my phone, and I won't be replying if you respond as my time is important.

I'm not whining, I just recognize why the 'majors' in the Bitcoin world don't have anything to do with Alts. It's why Coinbase, Circle, and BitPay exclusively deal with Bitcoin.

I don't believe that's true, I just think this developer has a misguided idea of 'diversification' in Crypto. The network effect of Bitcoin is huge. It would take a miracle or a significant security flaw in the protocol for an alt to surpass it or even be worthy of accepting.

It's just not gonna happen, I'm one of the most involved enthusiasts around and if Bitcoin crashes and burns I'm done with investing in cryptos, working on projects. I'll be throwing up my hands and working in other fields instead.

I give them the truth. Some people mistakenly think that Bitcoin can be compared to a company, like MySpace. In actuality it's a protocol that is vastly ahead of all the others and is "good enough".
The masses of consumers if using crypto someday don't care about faster block times, higher number of units, etc.
They're fooling themselves pouring resources and investments into Alts. 
@_date: 2015-02-07 05:22:30
A "history" of addresses is a bad idea. However a contacts list MIGHT be useful, as long as it's contacts of fellow Coinbase users. You don't want a list of old BTC addresses that you manually attach to friend's names, there's no telling how many things could go wrong.

I'm involved with a number of bitcoin businesses, and also know how bigger ones are approaching this situation. We don't buy into the racist "ChinaCoin" BS. Miner's aren't evil individuals, they're running a business - and this business will still be able to run the bitcoin network smoothly and efficiently.
People are about to have a huge wakeup call (the small minority who follow people like Luke). When "he" (aka him and a few followers) do a PoW change out of rage, you'll see how quickly that coin will be labeled an Alt Coin.
Our businesses are risky ventures to begin with. We don't have time to waste on an unproven PoW change altcoin.

My friend, the following that I'm about to lay out for you explains why you don't understand what you're talking about. Do not underestimate the power of network effect. There are no "teams" here (doge vs. BTC). They are simply protocols, and one is vastly ahead of the other:
1. BTC arrives to it's destination the moment you click 'send'. Waiting for more than one confirmation on an exchange is overkill, and it means that exchange doesn't understand security. The fact that it had to happen the next day is actually a problem of the traditional banking system, not BTC.
2. Doge is not 'cheaper' by any amount that actually matters. I send each BTC transaction with 2 cents. 
3. Nobody cares about the decimal places in Bitcoin. All the smart businesses price things in their local currency anyways which makes more sense. Besides, you don't think to yourself "oh, okay, this item costs 1,000,000 Doge so I know how much that is." No, you think "Okay so this costs 1,000,000 doge so that means it's actually "X" amount of dollars" as you work it out in your head or a calculator.

It is how it works, I'm not saying this WILL happen , but if the vast majority of miners went to mine something else, and those miners called it just plain "Bitcoin", then the majority of Bitcoin businesses would follow them AS LONG AS: the21 mil limit isn't challenged, the network still processes transactions, the usability of the network as a whole isn't that drastically changed to the point of not being user friendly.

1. If I send you Bitcoin it gets to you instantly, for 99% of commerce it's "safe enough" for you to accept it before the 10 minute confirmation. This is similar to cash transactions and counterfeit bills.
2. It takes energy/investment to create something of value.
3. Anything you can think of regarding "better usability" can be built on top of Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-03-05 15:59:45
Breadwallet always did and still does use 6 confirmations, and it shows as each one happens.  
The peers, if I understand correctly, are similar to how BitPay handles things. When I send a transaction in a couple seconds all three peers see it, which essentially means that the transaction has been sent successfully, and the risk of the payment being "cheated" on the network is low. (If I'm understanding correctly)
I love using Breadwallet ever since last summer

I'm confused, Breadwallet says 'most secure' and you call them out while you guys advertise it too?
With my limited technical knowledge, and from what I've learned the past few days, I don't understand how an Android wallet that runs on anything lower than Marshmallow can be as secure? It just doesn't make any sense to me. (I'm talking about strictly phones, not involving a separate piece of hardware)
Don't mean to go in circles, I just don't understand with these new advancements, if an android user is security minded and only wants to use their phone - why they'd use a wallet that supports less than Marshmallow?

You're right, truth is truth. For 95% of Bitcoin transactions there is no need to wait for a confirmation. For the other 5% there is truly only need to wait for 1 to 2 confirmations. Anything else is overkill.

One big thing (among other things) that bitcoin has going for it is name brand recognition. Bitcoin might have it's issues, but it's name is a big thing to disregard. For 9~ years the name Bitcoin has come up in the media over and over and over. It's still hardly known yet it's the most known.

I'm telling you as a friend, don't be a fool and invest a ton of money into Litecoin. Look at Bitcoin's market cap and hash rate, then look at the limited improvements Litecoin claims to offer. 
Bitcoin is a hard enough sell to the world and people aren't going to care about "block times, higher number of LTC available, etc")
The only reason a select few businesses (compared to BTC) are accepting litecoin is because:
1. They're catering to a VERY VERY niche demographic.
2. Their payment processor is trying to get an "edge" on BitPay in all the wrong ways.
3. They're hoping to make Litecoin more popular to get rich because they "missed the first BTC ride."

"In Android Marshmallow, a new Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) was added which is used by Fingerprint API, Lockscreen, Device Encryption, and Client Certificates to protect keys against kernel compromise and/or local physical attacks. Also, hardening of the system via policies enforced by SELinux were introduced. This offers better isolation between users and reduce threat of exposed services, further tightening of SELinux domains, and extremely limited /proc access. Other changes were added to help boost overall security, such as fingerprints to lock and unlock encryption keys, and verified boot."

That's good to hear about not running into any incidents yet (theft of BTC) for mycelium.
I'm guessing over time as market penetration for marshmallow gets higher then more wallets will use that as the baseline (like it happens with all other apps and versions of the phone os as future versions get released) 
Until then it's good there are options for those who don't have a phone released in the past 2 years (an estimate of marsh compatible phones)

With circle you get the same buy/sell price. So because of that there are "no fees" in your eyes. You could buy one BTC for $650, then turn around and sell it for the same $650

It has everything to do with this. You continually argue against Bitcoin, day after day, like it's your life mission. It makes ZERO sense.

yet mycelium description says that we have 100% control over private keys, while we all know that nothing is ever 100% certain in life. 
blockchain.info's wallet description is full of some of the most deceitful descriptions for that wallet when you compare actual real world impressions and stories here nearly every other day on reddit. (and some of my own personal impressions too)
in the end it comes down to reputation, and companies creating good and reliable wallets that are standing the test of time.

I saw this response, thought it was good to share:  
"As mentioned by others, marshmallow brings the requirement of hardware-backed encryption, verified boot chain, and access to the trusted elements, none of which were requirements for previous versions of android, and all of which were necessary for us to feel safe releasing a version of breadwallet for android."

I don't think this is a "merchant play" so to speak for your daily Wal-Mart runs. The significant purchases you make in your life need to have your identity known already, despite what purchasing method you use, so this just makes it optionally easier. 
If one wants to use Bitcoin "outside the system" it will still be just as easy as it is today.

Not really, I can't take ANYTHING you say seriously because no normal or sane person does this without something greatly benefiting them. Let's say your mom for example HATES Grape Jelly and feels that Strawberry Jelly is FAR superior. Your mom also LOVES the internet. Is she going to continually, day by day, MANY hours a day, for over a year or two sit on a grape jelly message board and argue against why it's horrible?? NO.
You make no sense, and I don't take anything you say into consideration. In fact, most would be wiser to do the OPPOSITE of what you say.
@_date: 2018-12-28 16:23:17
You don't have to "trust" me. Look at the reputation of the company (BRD)  and the fact that you said it's "not easy" to get around. 
I know you think you're doing a service to the community, but it's people like you that cause people to install things like Electrum on a desktop computer, and think they're being "super secure" when in actuality the safest choice for them was an app on their device. 
I mean no ill will towards you, I am however frankly just saddened by the lack of knowledge on this topic. (I've been involved in crypto and wallet development for nearly 6 years now) 
@_date: 2017-06-30 18:22:18

@_date: 2016-07-26 18:12:32
I can understand why that particular delay could be frustrating. 
I think it's awesome that we're even in a position for this to be "frustrating", ya know? A decade ago the thought of Bitcoin being where it is today would've been a daydream.

The ATM I used did require KYC, however when I used LibertyX they did not require KYC.
I think the moral of the story is KYC exists in many cases if you're dealing with the legacy financial system. 
@_date: 2017-06-11 01:25:51
In the wallet's description on the Google Play store, does it show that the wallet will work on a version of Android before 6.0?
If so, that means that malware can steal the private keys. It's only a matter of time before people start having their bitcoin stolen when "hackers" become all the wiser.
@_date: 2015-02-10 15:42:46
They do you moron. Typing up multiple paragraphs and **bolding** fancy words does not help your argument. If Microsoft, the 2nd biggest company in the world, wanted nothing to do with Bitcoin, then they wouldn't have a button on their site that says "Pay With Bitcoin."
@_date: 2016-07-09 05:24:29
LibertyX charges 1% like it says on their website. If the station had a $3 fee then it means the teller overcharged you $12 and ripped you off (whether intentionally or not) go tell them about it to their face. 
As for your wallet only showing $190, seems like your wallet is using a different exchange rate to calculate the amount in USD or there was a lot of volatility.
@_date: 2016-07-08 15:33:21
I would argue that if 2 1/2 months after his prediction  we're at $1150 then he was correct, wouldn't you? Two months of pausing isn't very much for such a big move 
@_date: 2016-07-20 14:51:19
On phones that have/support Marshmallow and upwards. Hopefully soon breadwallet will have it's full release on Android
@_date: 2018-12-25 21:26:33

You're not understanding it right. You don't need to wait for a confirmation! They use Coinbase. You just send the payment and when it confirms the order is completed, then they pack it up and ship it.
That "error" message is just a prebuilt template they show on their transactions. It's fine.
@_date: 2017-06-19 23:58:21
Does that require the two different wallet providers to start a partnership between the two of them? The "breadwallet to blockchain.info" channel?

@_date: 2015-02-26 16:36:22
This situation is confusing to me
@_date: 2018-12-28 16:38:11
That's the thing, a key logger isn't possible with the implementation that BRD uses.
For example the BRD app on Android will only allow you to use the OS' default keyboard
The $5 wrench attack still applies to your "ultra secure" setup as well. 
@_date: 2018-12-25 20:51:39
Goodness, you’re taking it out of context - it’s for the process of buying bitcoin with fiat. 
@_date: 2016-07-12 16:26:57
Yup, fortunately Breadwallet will not be at risk to this (on iOS and their future android release due to Marshmallow security advancements)
@_date: 2019-05-11 22:39:47
No, not possible as long as they are different (phone pin and brd pin)

@_date: 2016-07-21 15:45:05

@_date: 2019-05-14 04:57:38
BRD. Segwit is bech32, not experimental.
The only reason it’s not “turned on” by default is because the majority of the industry is behind and doesn’t support true Segwit yet.
@_date: 2018-12-28 16:06:03
So you can hack the Secure Enclave of iOS?
If you can, please share the details, as it would be a massive security breach that would make headlines across the globe.
(I'm not trying to be rude, I'm just calling your bluff. You don't know how to "hack" the Secure Enclave of iOS)
Edit: If you lose your phone, you just recover with your 12 word paper key that you wrote down. It's not difficult.
Edit 2: The BRD app requires the device supports Secure Enclave/Hardware encryption

@_date: 2017-06-29 15:10:31
You just created more hassle (not trying to be rude). I've been using Bitcoin since 2013, all you had to do is send the transaction with a semi decent fee, and it will confirm. It doesn't matter if it takes 10 minutes or 5 hours to confirm. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 04:03:11
Jaxx? lol
@_date: 2019-05-11 22:46:58
Bummer! 
What you described is only possible if:
1. The phone is jailbroken before you took it to repair store 
2. They guessed your PIN. Not easy because after about 8 different sets of trying the wrong PIN, the app wipes itself. 
3. You had your 12 word recovery key written down somewhere or shared it online. 
You should write into support if you have further questions for sure
@_date: 2017-06-06 19:20:04
Yeah breadwallet is the way to go

Breadwallet on android and iOS, can't go wrong IMO if you want something secure and easy. 
@_date: 2016-07-23 06:23:46
No, Breadwallet doesn't take a fee. Most likely bitcoinwallet uses a different exchange rate or the BTC price at that time was volatile.

True story - about ten years ago my grandmother lived alone after her husband died (my grandfather) somebody came to the house when she was alone and convinced her to sign over control many of their farming related businesses! It was insane - the person said that they could help the business grow even more.
Eventually my aunt (a lawyer) found out this happened and was able to get it all reversed thankfully.
My grandmother was a very bright woman, who helped run several businesses in her lifetime, but I suppose when you're 90 sometimes you kinda lose focus (and memory) on certain topics.

I'm constantly trying to learn more. From what I've learned the past few days, I don't understand how a wallet on Android that runs on versions below M arshmallow can be as secure. breadwallet requires Marshmallow. 
@_date: 2018-12-25 21:00:05
There is no point that stands, as you can use the wallet completely without the need of KYC.
@_date: 2017-06-01 15:25:39
I've been in bitcoin since 2013, so I hope you know I'm not ignorant when asking this:
If the coinbase wallet scanned a QR for a payment, why would the wallet send LESS than what the QR payment is for? So the user scans the QR code for a payment of $50 to buy them item.
Then it SHOULD attach an extra dollar or so for TX fees. So for conversation sake, it should be $51.
You're telling me that if a QR is set to $50, and a customer scans it, then the Coinbase wallet only sends $48 or so?
What kind of logic is that? Either you're completely mistaken or Coinbase's wallet is seriously fucked up.

Honestly just keep them in your Circle wallet. Judging by the questions you're asking you'll be better off with the security they offer.

They better understand, or this $40B experiment is about to turn into something much, much different.
BEST case scenario is it turns into an asset where people can buy in chunks and store in online exchanges, under custodial control. Retaining private keys is only meant for the wealthy.

I've tried to reason with Luke but there's no hope. These businesses that are built on top of Bitcoin, that have made Bitcoin great...there is 0% chance the major businesses are going to follow a chain that has a PoW change.
Their businesses are risky enough, they're not going to risk moving their business to a coin that is using an unproven PoW change. 
The ONLY reason they'd go all in for a PoW change coin, is if the other coin (let's call it the "miner coin") flat out didn't work at all, or changed the 21 mil limit, etc.
These stick your fist in the air ideals to "the man" (aka the miners) are crazy, and I can guarantee you that the businesses you use are laughing at them because it's idiotic at best.

"In Android Marshmallow, a new Hardware Abstraction Layer (HAL) was added which is used by Fingerprint API, Lockscreen, Device Encryption, and Client Certificates to protect keys against kernel compromise and/or local physical attacks. Also, hardening of the system via policies enforced by SELinux were introduced. This offers better isolation between users and reduce threat of exposed services, further tightening of SELinux domains, and extremely limited /proc access. Other changes were added to help boost overall security, such as fingerprints to lock and unlock encryption keys, and verified boot."

For better or worse, the industry (Bitcoin businesses) will follow the chain with the majority hashpower unless -A. The chain flat out doesn't work. Or B. Threatens very key aspects, such as the 21 mil limit.
The people who think industry leaders like Coinbase will follow a risky PoW change chain are flat out delusional.

If it happens, it doesn't mean it will succeed. The longest chain will be Bitcoin, and this is what the exchanges will call "Bitcoin" as well. 
If BIP 148 isn't the longest chain, then it won't be called Bitcoin by businesses. It will be "Bitcoin-Segwit", or "SegBit", or something of the manner.
Because one high profile developer continually says something will happen, it doesn't mean it will.

In regards to this aspect, there is no misguided decision. Somebody who wants to acquire crypto has to provide KYC (except if you’re using cash), might as well then use a wallet that is decentralized and doesn’t track user’s crypto balances/transactions.

I appreciate your kindness, but the term of “KYC wallet” doesn’t apply. Once you have crypto in your BRD app nobody can stop you from sending it to any address, or penalize you from sending to particular address.

@_date: 2018-12-28 16:27:59
A few notes:
1. If you're one that knows how to run external hard drives with VM, and you absolutely know what you're doing - then that option is more secure. You are in the minority, and most people have no idea how to do that.
2. With the hardware encryption on your device, you could click any malware ad on your phone and not be at risk. You need to understand what you're talking about. The private keys are essentially in their own "safe" that can't be touched by any other application. 
@_date: 2017-06-11 06:17:59

Everyone has a preference, I'm glad you have a wallet you like. 
I appreciate that breadwallet only works on Marshmallow 6.0 and above for Android. If an Android wallet works on an earlier version of Android, then it means your bitcoin is at risk (not using hardware encryption inside the device)
@_date: 2017-06-11 04:11:04
Yes, Bitcoin

better is subjective though, therefore we can't lump one chain into that category.

The chain flat out doesn't work. Or B. It threatens very key elements like the 21 mil limit.

I think what it comes down to is what is realistically possible: if you find an iPhone on the ground with a bitcoin wallet that is using the Secure Enclave - you are not going to be able to access those funds.
It's just not realistically possible - the phone will be completely wiped before the person manages to "reach" the bitcoin.

I just aim to use the coin that has the most acceptance, and I aim to invest in the coin that has the longest term appeal. To me, and most, it's Bitcoin. It's not about teams, it's just the way I view this market. 
The main thing I don't like about Doge is it's very low market cap. You can't facilitate much trade on it. When my grandfather passed his net worth was 1/14th of that coin's market cap, and he was just one dude who worked in a drug store that he opened and saved and invested in blue chip stocks. It just shows to me how little there is going for that alt.
Now, if Doge was the first of it's kind, that market cap wouldn't necessarily deter me. But the fact that it doesn't offer anything significant over BTC doesn't excite me.
Also, some people think that if BTC 'dies' then there needs to be another coin to take the spot. I disagree. If BTC 'dies' then it will be a VERY hard sell for the world to make another run with Crypto. Personally if that happened I would NEVER invest one dime into a Crypto, I would at the most use it to facilitate trade. This would be a problem for the crypto economy in the long run.

I've seen some silly things when these debates happen, like key people in the industry naysaying the competition or giving them the worst reviews on Apple Store or Google Play.

That line only works for so long. What about if it gets to $50? It doesn't seem that far fetched.
What will your line be? "Is it that much if that transaction moves $5,000 of value...."
There gets to point where the fee is too high, when only the wealthy can invest in Bitcoin because of the high tx fees.
