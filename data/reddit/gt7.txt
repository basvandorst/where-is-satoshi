US regulators eye Bitcoin supervision
By Tracy Alloway, Gregory Meyer and Stephen Foley in New York
 ©Bloomberg
Senior officials at a top US financial regulator are discussing whether Bitcoin, the controversial cyber-currency, might fall under their regulatory remit.
Bitcoin “is for sure something we need to explore”, Bart Chilton, one of the five commissioners at the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) told the Financial Times. A person familiar with the CFTC’s thinking said that the regulator is “seriously” examining the issue.
Said Mr Chilton: “It’s not monopoly money we’re talking about here – real people can have real risk in these instruments, and we need to ensure that we protect markets and consumers, even in what at first blush appear to be ‘out there’ transactions.”
Four-year-old Bitcoin is attracting the interest of regulators amid volatile booms and busts in the value of the cyber-currency and fresh media interest.Intensified regulatory scrutiny could pose challenges for proponents of Bitcoin, who have praised the currency for its independence from traditional authorities.
In March, a branch of the US Treasury department said that all firms that exchange or transfer the virtual currency will be considered “money services businesses”.
That means they must provide information to the government and introduce policies to prevent money laundering. It could also make it risky for other financial institutions to do business with firms that are not in compliance.
Since the ruling, at least three companies in North America have reported having their business accounts closed by their banks. Bitfloor, a New York-based Bitcoin exchange, said it was shutting down entirely, and it has not yet been able to return funds to customers.
Roger Ver, founder of Bitcoinstore.com and an angel investor in Bitcoin start-ups, said that he knew of some entrepreneurs who had moved to Panama to explore setting up operations outside of the US.
“Even if US regulations make it hard for Bitcoin businesses to operate in the US, that doesn’t mean it will make it difficult for people to use Bitcoin as a currency in the US. Bitcoin is a world currency,” he said.
The CFTC regulates derivatives contracts and, under Dodd-Frank financial reform, has sweeping authority to oversee retail foreign exchange dealers.
CFTC jurisdiction generally does not extend to cash markets unless exchanges list derivatives contracts based on them. For example, the agency monitors physical oil transactions insofar as they influence crude futures traded on the New York Mercantile Exchange.
One person familiar with the discussions said Bitcoin would not become subject to CFTC jurisdiction unless it becomes the basis for a derivatives contract. The use of Bitcoin to pay for ordinary goods is outside the commission’s bailiwick.
Leveraged Bitcoin transactions that settled in more than two days – so-called “rolling spot” transactions – would also fall under CFTC jurisdiction, the person said.
Said Mr Chilton, the commissioner: “In essence, we’re talking about a type of shadow currency, and there is more than a colourable argument to be made that derivative products relating to Bitcoin falls squarely in our jurisdiction.”

Norman Vialle, a 53-year-old car dealer in Kansas, invested in his share of winners and losers during the Internet bubble of the 1990s. Now he is clinging to a stash of Bitcoin, even though the fledgling virtual currency has lost about 70% of its value in the past week.
"It's volatile because it's new, but it's still a lot higher than it was a month ago," Mr. Vialle says.
In addition to investing in the currency, Mr. Vialle recently began accepting bitcoins for payment at Overland Park Jeep Dodge Ram Chrysler. One of his customers is planning to pay for a $40,000 Jeep with the currency next month.
 
Bitcoin is attracting attention as a wildly volatile, all-digital currency. How does it work? How are criminals taking advantage of it? How risky an investment is it? In this Bitcoin explainer, WSJ's Jason Bellini has "The Short Answer."
It has been a volatile month for Bitcoin, the virtual currency that is based on a mathematic algorithm and can be used to buy everything from maple syrup to pornography.
A furious run-up in the value of Bitcoin earlier this month has been followed by an abrupt price drop that has rattled investors. The price of one Bitcoin unit continued its dive on Tuesday, falling 39% at one point to $50 before recovering somewhat to around $70.
The unpredictable trading has given fresh fuel to skeptics, who question the viability of a volatile currency that isn't backed by a central bank.
"I think there are some businesses that offer legitimate goods that like the concept and like the cachet of it," said Beth Robertson, a senior consultant with Javelin Strategy and Research, which focuses on the payments industry. "But I don't think that you're going to see any broad base of merchants accepting Bitcoin."
Regulators, meanwhile, recently weighed in on virtual currencies for the first time, encouraging entities that exchange or sell them to follow the same money-laundering rules that apply to companies like Western Union Co. WU +1.15%
Despite the lack of wide acceptance and looming prospect for regulation, a cadre of Silicon Valley venture capitalists, Web programmers and anti-Establishment thinkers are still revved up about Bitcoin's prospects.
Unlike currencies that are backed by a central bank, Bitcoin users can essentially create the units themselves in a process called "mining" that involves solving a complicated mathematical problem with sophisticated computer servers.
The currency, which is stored in an online account, also can be traded on an exchange and swapped privately.
Bitcoin payments are becoming increasingly popular among Internet merchants, who want to reduce costs associated with accepting credit cards.
Bits and Pieces
Mystery still surrounds Bitcoin – its creator – or creators – has remained anonymous and specific details surrounding its history remain fuzzy. But buzz is growing, despite recent wild swings in the currency's value. Here's a rough timeline of the Bitcoin evolution.

The virtual currency also is starting to make inroads in the brick-and-mortar world, where customers can pay with bitcoins using their mobile phones.
But because the transactions are essentially anonymous, critics worry that the currency could be used for drug trafficking and money laundering.
The U.S. Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, known as FinCen, last month issued a three-page memo that effectively lays the groundwork to regulate firms that issue or exchange virtual currencies. Among other things, money transmitters must alert authorities if they believe a transaction might be tied to suspicious activity.
Despite the looming regulation, investors were encouraged by the memo. They believe increased oversight will ease money-laundering concerns that have kept some investors and merchants out of the market.
"The industry is happy about this guidance even if it imposes a regulatory burden because it is an indicator of respectability," says Behnam Dayanim, a lawyer at Paul Hastings LLP in Washington.
The memo helped spark a rally earlier this month on the Tokyo-based Mt. Gox exchange, which says that it handles 80% of Bitcoin trading. The currency nearly quintupled in less than a month, leaping from roughly $50 in mid-March to a high of $230 on April 9.
But since then, Bitcoin has plunged almost as quickly as it rose. Mt. Gox suspended trading for 12 hours last week after a surge in trading volume overloaded its system. The exchange also has been hit with cyberattacks. Such wild swings could make it difficult for the virtual currency to gain traction—among investors and businesses alike, experts said.
But Jennifer Longson, who began accepting bitcoins at her San Francisco cupcake bakery in October, considers the volatility to be no different from the fluctuations she sees in the price of her baking ingredients. Customers use Bitcoin for payment three or four times a week at her store, she said. "They're all excited to talk about it," said the owner of Cups and Cakes Bakery, whose concoctions include cupcakes made with ingredients such as bacon and tequila.
Ms. Longson's husband, Tom, has been buying and selling the currency for the past year. He cashed out his original investment when the price hit $100 in early April, but bought some for $241 last week.

Jason Schneider
"I lost some money, but not enough to jump off a building. Unfortunately, I sold some to a friend at that price as well and I felt guilty about that," he said.
The price gyrations are more worrisome to John Reitano, co-founder of three-month-old CoinFlash, a San Diego company that aims to launch a bitcoin-trading network that is similar to airport currency kiosks this summer. "Our hope is that the volatility settles down over time," said Mr. Reitano, who already is preparing to answer investor questions about the issue.
Entrepreneurs hope the new FinCen guidelines will help Bitcoin evolve into a more developed currency. A number of companies are expected to register with FinCen as money transmitters in the coming months. A few already have done so, anticipating that the industry would be capturing the attention of regulators.
But Mr. Vialle, the car dealer, still views Bitcoin more as an investing opportunity than a payment mechanism. He says he plans to hang onto his bitcoins, which he mined about a year ago, for the foreseeable future. "Maybe I will use them someday, but I probably will hold them for five or 10 years," he says.
