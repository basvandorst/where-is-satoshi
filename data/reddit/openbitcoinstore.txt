It is just a demo, you most certainly can add pictures. If you go to our directory of stores, you will see some shops with pictures. I'll make sure to have that added to the demo shop :)

Yes, it was this morning. Of course that's just the "wizard", the stores are hosted independently and were not down.
It's fixed now and made more robust. Thanks for letting us know!
@_date: 2013-05-08 20:37:05
Oh, yes, we will!
This is an example of what it means to have a community of store owners and not just a commercial service.
As people solve problems they bring that knowledge back into the community to support other store owners.
Many thanks 011010110!

Hi! Sorry! IRC can be a bit finicky. 
I'm just a PR guy checking this right now, and I'm sorry for the delay. I mostly manage this account and recently had to reset my phone, and lost the password, and forgot about it for a few days. 
As far as I know, the limitation is something like 20MB for uploading files, unless the file is the one people are purchasing itself (digital download purchases), in which case the limit is a few gigs. To be sure, please message the founder at info ! I am very sorry I can't help more. 
In the future, you may also submit support tickets to openbitcoinstore.happyfox.com
Once again I'm sorry for the delay!

Such a service would need to be licensed as a Money Service Bureau and exchange, which would greatly complicate things and subject it to regulations by FinCEN, AML etc.
There's a reason those services are not yet offered. If you see a big inefficiency in the market that no one is addressing, there's a regulator or law behind that, not a technical problem.

Great idea. We will add it to the feature list for the Directory section. 
Anyone here know how to implement on WordPress and want to volunteer to help make it happen?

We offer hosting for vendors and unless what you are doing is illegal, the rest is between you and the jurisdiction you are selling from/to. 
Bitpay have their own requirements, so that's something you will need to discuss with them. I don't think they have any limitations related to food, but I might be wrong.
The good news is that it will cost nothing to try!
@_date: 2013-04-29 01:32:57
Seems legit.

76 of last night. Not sure as of right now

We accept love, but also bitcoin at our donation address ;-)

It is entirely possible to create the program.
While you're at it though re-read my previous message because you will have to also create the following programs:
* The "give refunds out of my retirement because dwolla froze my account"
* The "ask lawyers to take BTC to defend against the IRS"
not a technology problem.

If you don't mind me shamelessly promoting, if you are actually interested, perhaps we at openbitcoinstore.com could work up a partnership? Toss me a PM

We've pre-integrated BitPay into a full store solution (Woocommerce), which can sell, tax, ship both intangibles and physical products in any currency, including bitcoin. Also does paypal and credit cards if you're so inclined.
@_date: 2013-04-22 16:17:28
Sweet! What are you selling?
@_date: 2013-05-08 20:39:04
We love Coingig too. The more the merrier.
We also have options that do not use bitpay, and we do not require any technical knowledge. But, we cannot offer commercial-level technical support, for that we depend on a community of store owners, volunteers and donations, in the spirit of an open source project. 
There are many ways to solve this problem and we have one of them, but we support, refer and celebrate all other efforts to make bitcoin retail thrive.
Go Coingig!
@_date: 2013-05-08 20:25:09
**Yes**, we can help with that. Just contact support from the openbitcoinstore.com page.

Launch a complete Wordpess/Bitpay and bitcoin-enabled hosted store in less than 30 seconds. 
Oh, it is entirely FREE. 
There is no easier, safer and less expensive way to open a bitcoin store.

Sounds pretty awesome! I'll have to check it out!
@_date: 2013-04-22 14:40:47
Wow, thank you!
@_date: 2013-04-22 20:29:42
78 applied for the beta. 6 launched during the beta. 
Since last night, 4 more have launched and I'm seeing new stores about once an hour. 
@_date: 2013-05-08 20:40:54
Yes, our store works with downloadable products. The OpenBitcoinStore is essentially just WP + Woo + associated plugins and bitcoin integration already done. We offer the free hosting and domain. 
But if you already have and run WP, we have instructions on what you need to get the same result on your own WordPress. We can also help you solve any glitches, even if you choose to run elsewhere. 
Our store or some other store - we support anything that helps bitcoin grow

Just go to the contact page on openbitcoinstore.com and click on the IRC link. It will start a web chat that automatically logs in to the correct IRC channel. Or send email so we can file a support ticket!
@_date: 2013-04-22 14:32:26
Why thank you :) I'll send that to our donation fund
@_date: 2013-04-26 04:59:52
OpenBitcoinStore uses Bitpay as the main payment plugin. 
It's all setup and ready to use. All you need is the merchant API key from BitPay, plug it in and start selling. 
We also like the stability and support of BitPay, which is why they are our default payment provider
@_date: 2013-05-10 07:00:19
You can run our stores without bitpay too, we will host you free. We also have a store owner who has finished their direct-to-wallet store (no bitpay) who is preparing instructions to share with the community. 
We support each other and figure things out together. Please join us, launch a store, ask for help, go on IRC and we will get you running!

Welcome to the OpenBitcoinStore community. 
We can help with custom DNS for you.
@_date: 2013-04-22 14:50:02
Awesome. We created a new bitcointalk account, and will start using it once we are unlocked from the newbie section. 
All help is welcome :) just toss an email to info , as well as your feedback. 
I'll add microtransactions to our list of things to add :)
