I'm sceptical that a neural network could reach 99% accuracy without having a decision process so complex that it would be no faster than brute forcing the hash. It could be the case that 50% is trivial, but 99% is vastly more intensive, if not actually impossible.
It'd be worth experimenting with, but I don't think results on anything much smaller than the full data set would tell you that much about the final performance.

24! is a big number, but the memorable sequences you'd use (every 2nd, every 3rd, every prime, digits of pi, e, e.t.c.) are actually very limited. If your recovery words are out there protected by only an ordering system simple enough for you to remember, someone is going to break it very easily.

Setup a GDAX account with your Coinbase credentials, then just use GDAX, fees are:
SEPA transfer in - whatever your bank charges, often free
Bitcoin sale or purchase 0.3% if you do a market order, free if you use a limit order (which is why you get the strange buy and sell walls €0.01 apart)
SEPA transfer out €0.15

It's this kind of muddled thinking and self appointed experts that's causing stuff like one of my current clients choosing to use blockchain to store the relational data for their new, entirely in-house, hosted on a single server, intranet app. I pity the guys that are going to have to support this.

The current run-up isn't even Bitcoin's biggest, they have it up 6,400% in the last three years, Dec 2011 to Dec 2013 it increased by 60,000%, before the crash.

Yep, plus they have a $/€ market, which if you're patient you can make a few extra % on. Beware the exchange rate can drift a little away from the real one.

I'm not convinced that such a function necessarily exists, but for a million numbers, it'd be easy to experiment and see, but then I can see, depending on the numbers in your set, you may find a function that works, but then...


I'm very much not convinced that it would generalise, ultimately the collection of functions that can be 99% accurate per bit might be no less computationally intensive than brute forcing the hash.
It reminds me of when I played with Metastock around 2000-01 and I found that for any share chart I could easily come up with a trading system that would have made me a million, but the system was too closely fitted to the stock and time frame and wasn't useful for anything else

If everyone on Earth had a computer that could generate a billion addresses every nanosecond, it would take over 6,600,000,000,000 years to generate them all. (2\*\*160/(3.154\*(10\*\*16)\*(10\*\*9)\*(7\*10\*\*9)))
If we'd all started the instant the universe began we'd only have 6,586,000,000,000 years to go.

Is this on the little splash window before it opens the main UI?
I had something similar last week, I had to kill it with task manager and then it just quit immediately every i loaded it. Uninstalled and reinstalled (v0.15.0.1), fired it up again, it took around four hours to start up with various messages like "reindexing" along the way but it's been fine since.

I think you would just pay the 3.99% fee, the 1.49% is if you're buying with money already in the account, which would have got you something like 192€ worth, could it be the price fluctuation that's made it 195€?

Easily, a 1 or 2% change would be basically no change for bitcoin.

Where we are now feels like where we were late 2013 to me. Although it looks like the merest blip on the chart now, the run up to over $1000 was major at the time. And there was lots of media attention.
 In fact the very same people who were calling/emailing me in late 2013 asking how to get into Bitcoin have been calling me over the last couple of months, and got the same answer both times "Don't!" (and they ignored me in 2014 when I told them it was safe to get in as it was no longer so hot)

the income gap has been falling for a while now, it's at something like a 25 year low now. The wealth gap wouldn't be affected by punitive levels of income tax, unless high earners who were also wealthy decided to flee it enmasse, but that wouldn't make those left behind any better off.
