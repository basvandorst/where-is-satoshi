Nice one, I quit in May 2016, wish i had put the money saved into btc but the rewards in terms of health benefits and time on this planet can't be measured financially . . .

You're bang on the money here, it's a definite fishing scam, google like to go on about the quality of their serps but when it comes to paid ads it's money that counts. Clear double standards, anyone can pay for a spot at the top with a garbage site or phishing site but if you don't pay then they are far stricter on who gets to rank and who doesn't.

Some may be scams but there are clear guidelines on what to look for to make an informed decision, you can drastically increase the odds of picking a winner if you do the right research and by covering a few you stand a chance of making some good money . . .

You can withdraw it but it took me a day or so to do it and i had to contact support who knew it was an issue to do with withdrawal verification emails - i looked it up and others had had the same problem quite a while before me so it's clearly been a problem they had issues with for some time and that kind of thing immediately undermines your trust in somewhere i feel.

The Hydro power used for mining in Quebec is a real step in the right direction though, cheaper prices and renewable energy to combat the environmental the concerns about energy usage.

Try binance.com perhaps - I've heard good things from a friend just getting into crypto and putting more money in like yourself, says it's easy to use -  Ive been using Kraken like yourself but found it a bit of a pain especially when i couldn't withdraw my ETH.
