You have the price locked in at the time of purchase.

I did a small test transfer from GDAX to my phone wallet and was definitely charged a tx fee.
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:23:33
There is a .5% margin added to the GDAX/BTC price on Coinbase, then an additional 1.49-3.99% fee depending on your payment method.

I've been waiting for Gemini to verify me for over a month. Is that normal? GDAX did it in a day.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:47:58
I just placed my first GDAX Stop-Loss order  My last (and highest purchase) was at 10k. Ready for the dip!
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:02:17
Thats awesome, you're much more brave than me! What I've learned, and what you know, is the message is so important. I'm very excited for what you are doing for our money and looking forward to seeing you more in the future.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:44:19
On GDAX (only exchange I'm familiar with) you can set Market, Limit, or Stop orders. A stop order will place a market sell order once the price drops to a certain point.
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:22:42
I agree. You can also duplicate that wallet on Electrum if Samourai ever goes away for some reason.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:21:00
I agree. But when I first started public speaking I was the same way. Not everyone is a natural in front of a group or on camera. Being on national TV discussing a difficult financial subject has to be crazy nerve wracking for people who haven't had a hundred lights shined on them before.
@_date: 2017-12-15 02:51:58
Instead of cracking one specific wallet, how about generating random wallet addresses and checking for any coins? How long would it take to locate any coin that way on a reasonably fast computer?
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:24:10
The only option is to do an ACH deposit and wait a week for it to clear. But by then, you'd have made back the fees from a weeks of growth.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:25:12
I bought some on my CC this morn when I woke up. Already well in the black after fees, and have a stop-loss order in effect to cover my ass.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:26:01
When I pulled up the article, I'm like "Who's those guys?"
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:31:16
Thanks. I sent them an email this morning. My bank hasn't been verified yet (Chase) after many weeks. If they want my business...
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:33:31
If you do a bank account deposit on GDAX, you don't have to deal with manual transfers from Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:26:16
I send some money to coinbase from every paycheck and do dollar cost averaging. In a dip, I'll eat the fees and purchase instantly. There's options depending on how greedy we want to be.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:00:22
I'm getting nothing done at work.
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:53:48
Mmmm, al pastor!
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:57:53
It could be Chase, obviously other people are getting verified on Gemini. I have other cash accounts, I think I'll give that a try.
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:32:05
It can be worth it in a dip if you don't have any fiat stored on GDAX. I use a "Buy the Dip?" spreadsheet that shows me the return I'd get at the ATH at various dip prices. It prices in the Coinbase margin and CC/ACH fees.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:23:26
Holy fuck I love this.
@_date: 2018-05-05 02:33:12
Aaaaand, then it dumps.
@_date: 2018-05-05 02:32:40
My current breakeven is $11,087. Somebody make me a meme.
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:50:47
It sure does! But I'm basically going by the dollar cost averaging method. Every Thursday I send a set amount to GDAX. It's debited from my account on Friday (payday), and posts on the exchange on Wednesday. Then I buy BTC whenever I feel it's the best price that day.
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:44:52
There's a risk that BTC won't drop enough to trigger your order price and you get stuck holding your fiat. There's also a risk that it will drop another 50% after your order fills and you paid more than you needed to. It's a very volatile space and full of risk in any way you approach it.
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:02:26
Last Thursday, Thanksgiving, I saw a quick dip and grabbed some at $8k. God damn 30% return in 5 days.
@_date: 2017-11-09 18:05:24
Instawallet? That's where my .23 coins disappeared to.
@_date: 2019-12-23 23:54:23
Which case is that?
@_date: 2017-11-01 15:10:22
I just started buying. Even a small amount at the ATH yesterday. So far, even that's up 3%. Overall I'm up 10% for about 2.5 weeks of purchases.
@_date: 2017-11-15 15:11:36
And thanks to the week long deposit times on CB/GDAX, I missed the damn dip!
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:37:00
Coinbase also lets you buy immediately with a credit card  if you want to move quick in a dip. There are higher fees with that, but it's sometimes worth it.
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:29:06
And what a shit ton of volume on GDAX the past hour... Just sitting now and hoping for my 7250 buy to get filled.
@_date: 2017-11-16 00:10:42
That is an option for sure, and I'm sure buying in the dip would have overcome the extra fees for insta-buying. But I don't like fees and I'm pretty much buying about $100/week without trying to time the market. Hopefully my buying schedule and the dips will sync up someday.
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:49:08
I'm very pleb as well, I just hate fees.
@_date: 2017-11-08 15:07:28
Same here. I'm also subbed to and feel like I'm in a fog when I switch between subs.
@_date: 2017-11-01 17:01:50
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:16:04
Put your USD on GDAX and place a limit order. No fees when the price hits.
@_date: 2017-11-08 16:20:19
That stuff makes sense for sure. More for me, one sub is super all about the S2X fork, the other feels it's the worst idea ever. So for someone who's just barely gotten involved, it's difficult to understand what side is right. And for small time people like myself, holding my part of a coin on GDAX, which is going to give me equal of each coin, does it even matter?
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:34:40
Oh my bad. Any other exchange avail in your area that offer limit orders?
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:10:01
I'm in my mid-40s, with a bunch, but not nearly enough in my 401k or other savings.  
  
BTC lets me feel like I might be able to retire before I'm 70. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 16:24:35
It does seem to compare to some of the worst political subs on reddit! But since I'm new to bitcoin, I look in there from time to time, hoping to see multiple perspectives.
@_date: 2012-08-31 04:57:10
I like BTC for the potential it holds, but I don't have faith long term. I'll convert USD to BTC, make a purchase, walk away. But I don't have the faith to 'invest' in BTC and let it sit in my wallet. I want to believe it will be there tomorrow, or believe it will be worth some value, but I'm still worried about that. And I don't know what can make me comfortable in that arena.
@_date: 2017-10-20 16:57:15
I could have invested $50/month 5 years ago and would have been doing quite well today. But I didn't.  
Now I'm investing $200/month, and hoping to be doing quite well in 5-10 years.
@_date: 2017-10-26 16:57:30
I have an extra android phone that I factory wiped, updated, and installed Mycelium on. No sim card, and I only turn on wifi when I do a transfer. I have a very small amount of coin I'm keeping on it right now, mostly for learning purposes.
@_date: 2017-10-20 16:33:16
I think it depends on the market. Coinbase/GDAX topped at 5997.
