ya, it might take years, but at least the target is clear, finding the private key in the painting. so it is worth working on it even if we don't find the answer

so, with all the confusions, can you re-list all the clues which are still valid, so at least we are not wasting time cracking the wrong clues. and if you could just let us know what we are actually looking for please? is it a private key or 12 words bip39 word or is it 24 words?
just feeling de-motivated when i'm thinking if i'm working on the correct target answer or not... i believe we all are using hours and days or maybe weeks time working on this puzzle :)
thanks a lot

the 1btc wallet link is given on blockchain.info, so i assume the wallet is created on blockchain.info, therefore the seed passphase should be AUTO generated by the site's function in BIP39 and it is only 12 words, not 24 words. ** i dont find any options for setting own selections of words, correct me if i'm wrong **

Just google and you'll see a lot of REAL events happening around Asia. It's not scam alright. I've bought Utoken since last year and instead of losing money like i had with Bitcoin, I made over 1500% for a year.
btw, I'd bought samsung note 3 with Utokens just 4 months ago. well, scam? i don't think scam can get you a phone.
