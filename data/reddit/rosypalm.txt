Yeah, very faithful to the source material.

Seems legit. Sign me up twice!

Wait, you spent time researching just so you could leave a snide comment, but you couldn't be bothered enough to figure out how coinbase works before you threw money at it?
Calling you purely incompetent is probably going to be the nicest comment you get.

Guess proper grammar and syntax aren't radical enough

You forgot this part of the story:
"Dear diary, today I decided to have someone killed to protect my baby..."
Ross detailed every single one of his illegal activities in his journal.

He was offered some kind of plea deal and Dratel turned it down flat.... then presented a defense guaranteed to put his client behind bars for the rest of his life.
@_date: 2016-02-25 06:07:50
He is supposedly very good, but he spent too much time fighting minutia while throwing his client under the bus to set up gotcha moments that ultimately fizzled.

Talk our underage kids into doing the illegal stuff since all they'll get is juv'y time?
It just might work! ;-)

I didn't like them either so I gave Coinbase a try. That archaic 4 day wait while you watch your coins either soar to a value you can't realize, or watch them plunge to a value you can't take advantage of since your money is tied up already. If you are actually trying to purchase anything with bitcoins it requires you to guess on Monday what coins will be worth on Friday. For those low fees you get all of the risk and Coinbase reaps all of the rewards. That $8 doesn't seem like it's that much after spending a week using Coinbase to turn $100 into $50 (while it spent the rest of the week at $200).

Naw, realising how old these posts are, and seeing the next poster down last posted yesterday made my day.
Keep on Trucking Fungivore! ;-)
Any mirrors up for the bitcointalk.org links?

So we went from the highly unlikely scenario that the bank did a full review of your account in one day over an unexplained 200 odd bucks, to the even less likely scenario that they did it in a couple hours?
You are definitely concealing some very important details in your accounting of events.

The Feds take out kiddie porn and nobody cares how much it cost them, or how they did it.
The "War on Drugs" doesn't scare anybody anymore.

While bitcoin has been gaining ground I would think calling it generally acceptable is a bit of a stretch. I haven't heard of a single instance of workers picketing to demand they be paid in bitcoins. Can you pay for your groceries with it no matter where you are?
It's primary use, right now, is as a token a handful of people use for irrevocable transactions, mostly done online.
@_date: 2013-05-04 22:54:34
Yeah. I guess if you're holding them long-term it makes sense, but if you are trying to use bitcoins they leave a bit to be desired.
