Nobody has time for your sub anymore.

Erik is one of the most liked and followed members and leaders of this community.  I tend to click on his name just to read his most recent posts because I value them.  I don't even upvote them, because why bother? Scores are all hidden here anyways.  I have watched things around here for a while, and Erik is right a lot of people cried because they got downvoted then blamed it all on manipulation.  This sub has been a complete censor-fest and that is why the other sub is over half the size as this one and growing.  I barely even post in this one anymore, the opinions here are way skewed.  You think the other sub just emerged out of a vacuum? Obviously it was a result of the censorship and mod manipulation here.

Transaction volume always peaks on Mondays then drops off the rest of the week.  The date to watch for is next Monday.

Satoshi chose Gavin Andresen as his right hand man and left things in Gavin's control when he left.  But I guess Adam Back has usurped his way into the new Satoshi role claiming he invented it and everything.

If you knew anything, the other sub has been warning that the same thing is going to happen again on Monday when transactions spike.  Don't you even know that transaction volume spikes every Monday then drops off the rest of the week? Funny how people just call it all spam, when spam was probably like 1% of it.  The storm is over eh? You are all going to look pretty stupid come Monday.
@_date: 2016-03-05 18:42:23
because you said so.

Not really spam since most of it is natural growth.  Wait until next Monday to see what happens,.  If you knew anything you would know transaction volume spikes every monday, and growth rates are much faster in winter than summer.

Just curious, what is the evidence that this is a stress test? Because it looks like natural growth to me: 
@_date: 2016-03-01 20:34:44
I have not seen any evidence that this is a spam attack and not natural winter season growth amplified by a high traffic Monday.

There is always going to be a certain level of spam no matter what.  Even if the amount of spam was only 1%-5%, the Core people would claim its all spam and not natural growth.  Most of this is natural growth.

Obviously he is not Satoshi.

Segwit will not allow higher blocksize.  This is equivalent of Luke-jr advocating for the geocentric theory.  You are very good at twisting words and meaning.  Segwit may provide some scalability benefits, but not a higher blocksize.  Also its going to take long, long after April, considering the entire network of wallets need to be upgraded to have any benefit for scalability, and the April time frame looks like it was way too optimistic for segwit deployment anyways.

Do you agree that war and military action can be used to create peace and stability in certain regions?
