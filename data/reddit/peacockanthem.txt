Ok that's good advice, I could just keep it as an investment in bitcoin and hope that it's value doesn't drop. And in case I'll ever want to change it to fiat currency, I'll do some research, but who knows when that'll be.
I also googled a bit more and found out that there's sites that accept bitcoin as payment directly, so I suppose that I could do that if I want to buy something without converting to euros. Oh and yeah I'm from europe - slovenia to be exact, if it helps at all with what I can do with crypto.

Wow that's a lot of good stuff, thanks alot! Well I thought about puting the fiat currency to paypal, where I'd then either use it for purchases for let's say travelling stuff/tickets etc. or just then put it directly into my bank. 
But yeah, that with coinbase is really useful, I didn't know they had that kind of authority, I'll be more careful with them I suppose. I'd use bitcoin too, but it I don't really know what for. My original plan was to use this money for random online purchasing, and I don't see where I could directly use bitcoin like that. Either way, thanks again!

I searched for ways to get paid for online things and I later that popped up.

holy sht I definetly didn't know about all of this! It'd probably take me hours to find this info, thank you so much! Plus I live in the capital, so btc city and most of the bitcoin-friendly locations would probably be more than available to me. Thanks a lot, I guess I know how I can spend my bitcoin now \^\^
