Because I bought them in 2011.
@_date: 2013-12-09 19:17:02
Yes! I love that track.
@_date: 2013-10-04 23:49:11
Thanks for the education you guys. I'm going to look into these things.
@_date: 2013-09-26 01:09:27
That's part of the plan. The real money is in suing these guys.

Your argument is nonsensical. I assume that you trust the bank to hold your money, but that doesn't mean you should be okay giving anyone else access to those accounts because they have a website and a promise that they won't take your pseudo-untraceable funds.
And it's been reiterated before, but you certainly shouldn't be leaving your bitcoins on any exchange if you have no intention of making a transaction in the near time. Historically the risk is high, and there is no advantage to doing so.

I really appreciate you taking the time to write that.

This would be a tremendous tool for showing bitcoin to non-bitcoiners. They always get stopped up on "Can I go spend them at the store?" and if the answer is anything but "Yes", then they have a hard time seeing the value.

Awesome! Any info on who is behind the Panama Fund? Is Voorhees involved?
@_date: 2013-10-04 02:05:41
Yeah, but they are charging back because it's looking like their miner might not be a money printing machine. So they were never about bitcoin to begin with.

Well, as long as you're gambling and "fucking it", you should bet all those bitcoins on Just-dice, in a desperate gambit to double up and pay everything off.

We're out of recession? I think that's where you and the bitcoin "circle jerkers" disagree. As long as we continue to allow the problem to be pushed down the line by changing the definitions of unemployed, extending benefits, raising debt ceilings, easing quantitatively, and bailing out everyone who inevitably got sucked into the mire, there will be no recovery, only a more disasterous collapse, eventually.
The rally cry for consequences now, is not just for the sake of watching the value of bitcoins go up; it's to preserve any hope that might still exist, of an eventual recovery. A real one, not a recovery backed by debt. It's better to go vomit right now, than be up all night feeling nauseous, only to vomit later and be out for the count the next day.
I don't think there are any debt conselors out there who advise getting a credit card with a bigger limit on it to get yourself out of a spiraling debt problem (although I wouldn't be surprised these days). Theoretically, if the limit were high enough, you could in fact live a comfortable life without responsibility, and be dead before any of the consequences kick in. However, when everyone is doing that, the system doesn't work, and we've been getting away with it long enough, that consequences are becoming more immenent.

Bitcoin price is only one indicator of a USD bubble, although I agree. The evidence is overwhelming. Everyone buy bitcoins!

Site looks great, and I'm excited to recieve updates.

Someone please make "Super TOR", where users relay encrypted traffic, but also become hosts of mirrors of the pages they visit.  
This would make high-traffic sites like Silkroad much faster, as you'd be loading parts of it from your peers (a checksum would ensure the site matches the original source, similar to the way we use the bitcoin blockchain).
The goal would be to boost anonymity, and responsiveness while protecting the sites against hacks or takedowns.

Thank you vbenes. You forced me to learn how to use the tip bot!
@_date: 2013-10-04 21:39:41
Wow, it looks pretty awesome.  Is the backend process automated, or do the orders need to be processed manually?  Is there a way to get into the beta right now, or how soon until the userbase will be expanded?

According to the recent "Analysis of Silk Road" article on thegenesisblock, Silk Road facilitated 9.5 million bitcoins in transactions between Feb 2011 and July 2013. This figure proportedly comes from the complaint filed against Ross by the FBI.
At 7% fee (which is what I understand Silk Road charged it's sellers? Buyers as well?), Silk Road had pocketed 665,000 bitcoins over that period of time. From what I understand, Ross lived a pretty low-key lifestyle, i.e. he wasn't out calling attention to himself with extravagant purchases. He shared an apartment with a roomate, to which he paid $1000 a month rent.
The Feds seized something like 27,000 bitcoins, a figure which INCLUDES buyer and seller account balances. I think you can pretty clearly see that was the site's "hot wallet", and explains why it was not encrypted. The rest of those coins are still out there somewhere, perhaps there was/is a backup plan in place, or perhaps they are lost forever.

Now, all that having been said, hurry up and buy a bunch of bitcoins, because they are going to the moon and never coming back!

I don't think it's impossible, more difficult, maybe. They could provide an open source trading interface that you run client side with your API info to manage your accounts instead of asking for the info to plug into it server side (and yes, these already exist). 
Alternatively, they could hold balances at all of the exchanges (both cash and btc) and provide the arbitrage trading instantly to the user for an additional fee to cover their risk.

This is a great thing.

I guess there must be a third one then.

This was the same experience I had in English class. Our first assignment was to express our feelings on Poetry,  among other English related topics, and I think I did that very well. My personal feelings on Poetry are not that positive, as it's mostly useless to me and my career aspirations at the time. I don't think negatively toward people that find it valuable, though.
Anyways, my teacher was not happy to read my feelings on Poetry, gave me a 0, despite my 100% honesty on the subject. She organized a parent teacher conference with ALL of my teachers and the vice principal, in an attempt to have me punished and removed from her class. My mom read my paper, and while I was not there, she told me that she had a hard time not laughing in the lady's face.
I did not recieve any punishment, so I guess the meeting didn't go her way. But for the rest of the semester, I got an F on every assignment I turned in to her, and failed the class. I didn't really care about this at the time, she was obviously a bitch and I didn't need the class to graduate. It does illustrate that the OP's experience is far from unique. Our school system blows.

This is cool. I especially liked the idea of putting some homeless to work to build shelter for other homeless. This seems like the best way to maximize donations.

Ifrastructure failure. Investors were spooked as a series of DDOS attacks on nearly every bitcoin related website caused havok on the bitconomy. It then became clear that we weren't ready for exponential growth, as we were already hitting the ceiling.
The solution is decentralization. Bitcoin can soar higher when there is not a definative answer to the question, "Where can I trade bitcoins for _____?" We've made some strides since then, but a long road ahead still.
