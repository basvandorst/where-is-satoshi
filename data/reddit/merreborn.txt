Correct me if I'm wrong, but I was under the impression that only miners really had voting power on the network.  Holding coin or running a node doesn't really matter.  Miners generate the blocks, and the people who generate the blocks have control over what rules they apply to the block generation process
And miners don't necessarily hold coin long term.  They have big power bills they have to pay, denominated in fiat.

Except no one is saying "your $20 is worth nothing".  On the contrary, the feds seize that $20, and then spend it themselves.  It's still worth $20 when they spend it.  It never stops being worth $20.
Also, I may be wrong, but I'm getting wiffs of "fiat is terrible; cryptocurrency is superior" from this thread.  If that is in fact what's going on, it's worth noting that the feds have already seized millions of dollars worth of bitcoin to date -- so cryptocurrency isn't really immune to this problem either...

"Third world" as a synonym for "developing nation" is a recent perversion of the terms as they were originally defined by the United Nations in the 40s.  It happens that many "3rd world" nations are also developing nations, but that doesn't mean all 3rd world nations are developing nations -- much like all squares are rectangles, but not all rectangles are squares.
If you read the linked definition in full, all neutral nations (not aligned with either the axis or allies) are "3rd world" per the original definition.  It has nothing to do with economic status.

To play devil's advocate:
You can accept that he's guilty of the charges, while also believing that the law is unjust.  Like the post you replied to said, who did he hurt?  His supporters might argue that he's guilty... of a victimless crime.
So even if he's guilty as hell, of violating the laws as they are written.  That doesn't necessarily mean he's morally in the wrong.
As a admittedly laughable example: Rosa Parks was guilty of violating a Montgomery, Alabama city ordinance segregating bus seating.  She was arrested and convicted.  Does her conviction make her any less the hero?
If you're a hardline, an-cap libertarian, then Ross is a hero, even if he's guilty.  He broke the law, but it's the law that's wrong, not him.
Not really my personal view, but point is, from a certain perspective, it's not unreasonable.

There are a maximum of ~21 million possible BTC; currently less than 17 million have been issued.

Sounds similar to paying with a credit card.  The text below the signature line says something like "I agree to the terms of the cardholder agreement..."
Perhaps another worthwhile comparison: paying by check.  When you write a check, how does the merchant know the check won't bounce?

If the solution to the security issue is waiting for the non-tech-savvy to die off, well, that's gonna take a few decades.  
Thing is, there's money to be made in commoditizing security.  That's basically what credit card companies already do.  If bitcoin goes anywhere, you can bet your ass someone's gonna make a lot of money finding a way to make it relatively securely available to the unwashed masses
Also of note, some of the places where bitcoin can do the most good are places where technology isn't as readily available.  Bitcoin's pretty big in Argentina due to government manipulation of currency down there, but even the "younger generation" in Argentina has less access to tech than we do in wealthier nations.

There are apparently two lawsuits in play here.  The CC issuer's suit against him, and his suit against the CC issuer.
The CC issuer basically lost the suit against him (in spite of much of the eLawyering in this thread)


The other case -- his counter suit against the CC issuer -- will be heard in September.
