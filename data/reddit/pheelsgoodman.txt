what if I don't want to put the money from the card back on the card??  like, why would I do that?

How does "don't invest more than your willing to lose" and "i've invested WAY more than I can lose" pair together?

That news will be drowned out by all the pumping by alt coins that can fill that void.

In my experience without using some form of peerblock when torrenting, I get a cease and desist letter about 75% of the time.....  
5 years ago I'd put that number around 5%....  
They are watching bro, what do you think net neutrality is about?

They are also locking crypto traders out of their bank accounts.  And I thought Aussies were cool.

Why can't target just take another micro payment crypto?  Politcal pressure?
@_date: 2017-12-31 05:58:34
I don't see why they will need to convert to USD?  I'm very new though, so not financially educated whatsoever.

Hardly anyone really has, this is some next level shit right here.   Give the world about 2 years before they even understand what the blockchain is......    Until then, ELI5 everybody man, its the right thing to do.

Thanks for taking the time to discuss.     Right now, we have more than one currency in the world and they have figured out how to maintain enough stability to continue global commerce.   Also, in the crypto world, we have the USDT or Tether, that was created for that reason, to maintain stability.  And it has done that so far, albeit with some controversy. Still, there are other coins just like Tether that are gaining momentum so it's pretty clear that the idea and tech has some value, just needs some tuning.

I mean, once everything is well established, won't it be advantageous for Target to have their own coin, that customers purchase and use very similar to the business model of many current shit coins?  Imagine BTC with a market cap 10x of today.  Easily achievable in a few years with the world on board.... After say 10 years? Full adoption?  World currency?  A market cap of 1,000 trillion could be reasonable. Although.... at that point the dollar is dead, so 1,000 trillion "USD" market cap won't really make sense anymore, right?  It will just be... bitcoin.  And only less than 42 million of them in the world.  Surely there will be enough wealth there that can be loaned against target coins to help them with large capital purchases.   Maybe?

It's all about politics.  Bitcoin and it's technology has been around for centuries in relative terms to the crypto world.  After that long in the market, people rise to the top and begin to have opposing views on how the future should look for the currency.   Some have business interests, some have technical interests.   These worlds don't mix.  So in a similar fashion to religions, the political factions split into BTC and BCH.  Now we are witnessing the ensuing battle between these two factions that once were one.  Mis-information through their respective sub-reddits (r/bitcoin is the BTC sub, and r/btc is the BCH sub), market manipulation, etc. Nothing new in terms of a standard political fight. 
At one point prior to the fork, my observation was that BCH split because they had high technological aspirations for the currency, while large mining pools wanted to keep BTC  the way it was for business purposes.    But once the split happened and all the misinformation started, I really don't know because I don't have a high enough level of knowledge and experience to decide on my own..

What prevents a crypto currency from becoming stable, once we have full global adoption?
@_date: 2017-12-31 03:55:23
Why won't target just accept another micro payment crypto and cut out the middle man bullshit that does nothing but create political influences that ultimately stagnate or eliminate technological advancement due to its competition with economics gain?
Fuck the big banks and their ripple.

I think someone said they just use USD over there

This is a great quote.

People aren't saying every new tech is going to change the world like crypto.  I haven't heard that claim about any new tech.  People got pretty hyped about drones, but not like this.  And that industry is killing it right now.

What did you buy on the internet in the 90s?  Not much probably.  What do people buy on the internet today?    EVERYTHING
