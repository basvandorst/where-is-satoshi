I don't know him but me I was way too proud to ever beg. 
The way I got my first 100 golds was to go buy a pile of "Cooking Books" (remember there was no trainer for that and only one place to buy those) and sell them at the AH for around 1 gold profit.
@_date: 2011-06-21 12:04:38
Ok so there is no existing 500K account. Only a shitty vulnerable financial web site that permit to had 500K bitcoins to a user without any kind of verification.  I guess it was possible to simply go to the SQL field of a user and change the amount of bitcoins.
I think that such system should have a couple of double checks build into it. It should verify the integrity of it's data i.e. if I am about to place an order the system should verify that my balance match with my last deposits historical data and things like that.

That's because he stole them before you registered. Lucky you.
@_date: 2011-06-22 04:07:28
I only have a couple of bitcoins and I implemented  relatively good security measures. I just can't understand how can someone with $75K just leave then there knowing that his password has been published all over the web. WTF is wrong with those people???
Thanks to all those morons the richest people of the bitcoin economy will now be thieves and scammers.

The thing is that by reinstalling Windows there is a very good chance (not 100% but still very good) that you wrote new data over the data of your wallet. At that point it's extremely difficult to recover. There is probably still people in the world with the correct equipment that can possibly do something but they charge a couple of thousand dollars per hour for their services.
In any case here is a good free software that I used many times to recover lost/erased Data. Good luck.

I keep thinking about the Bitcoin and far-west analogy and the more it evolves the more it's similar.
* It starts with some idealist dream of freedom.
* Then some people discover they can get rich quick by mining and massive amount of people star going bat shit insane about the whole thing.
* When business and ventures pop up everywhere thieves and bandits suddenly jump into the game and try to rob first the people then the banks.
* Now we are talking about printing some "Wanted" poster with a reward.
Next step sheriffs.

Unfortunately I wasn't ready yet. It was 2 weeks ago I had just discovered bitcoins and I still wasn't sure if I was going to mine or not, I had no PC to put them in. Once I made my decision a couple of days latter it was too late.
To make things worst I was probably the first to see his ad because I saw it 10 minutes after he posted it.
To make things even worst those card were new, the guy pulled and replaced them a couple of years ago from three machines that were used for extensive 3D modeling with more appropriate cards for the job. He sold them because he was doing some cleanup and getting rid of old hardware. Probably even negotiable.
I still should have bought them even if I was not going to mine. I could have sold them back easily for $500 each on ebay.
@_date: 2011-06-22 12:16:50
Oh but according to MagicalTux he used the internet the same day mtgox was hacked. Isn't that proof enough?
@_date: 2011-06-20 22:55:42
Holly shit. So one possible explanation is that the 500K account was mtgox account and the only reason they are doing the rollback is to save their own ass. 
When customers get hacked it's the customers fault and there is nothing to do but when mtgox account gets hacked then they roll back the whole market as if it was only a multiplayer online game and they are the server's admin.

PEOPLE LISTEN TO THIS MAN!
Like he said there is a process to fight back bogus Trademarks claims like this one and we need to follow it. I am not 100% familiar with the process but I think opposing their trademarks will cost maybe a couple $100 so the community may have to chip in a couple of bucks if necessary. We need  to identify exactly this process instead of just rambling about how unfair this is. Let's all try our best to find it and report it back here for everyone to know.
Not sure if this is the correct info but here it says that a ["Notice of opposition, per class " cost $300](
EDIT 2:
I think [this is the correct form]( to submit an opposition.
@_date: 2011-06-19 22:02:39
I am optimistic. I believe we are assisting at the birth and evolution of some new system. Before it stabilize there will be a cat and mousse game between hackers and the bitcoin industry but in the end some balance will be reached. 
Each attack seems to get bigger and I am sure that there will be a bigger one soon. At the same time services providers like mtgox will either have to invest in better security or go extinct and be replace by more competent players.
@_date: 2011-06-20 18:49:44
The security feature of the bitcoin is that it can't be counterfeited. The data associated with what you have in your wallet is unique and only associated with your wallet. In other words people can't create fake bitcoins so it's safe to accept them. 
They can still be stolen if someone hack or physically access your computer and copy your wallet. In fact it's much easier to steal than real money in an online bank account or paypal account.
@_date: 2011-06-26 13:40:06
That guy his just clueless and slightly retarded. He submit his post with a spammy generic unoriginal concept to the main reddit section then complains that reddit hates bitcoins because he got no traction. 
@_date: 2011-06-23 16:02:41
That is my theory too however I also consider that maybe the hacker wasn't that much prepared so he first tried to take the 500K but it didn't worked so he just took the maximum 59 bitcoins ($1000/17) and then sold everything else for a penny in spite.
@_date: 2011-06-20 16:13:12
Good point I will create a secondary bank account specifically for bitcoins transactions. The more buffers the better.
@_date: 2011-06-22 15:57:14


You are making shit up. Stop it. He never placed an order before the crash and not even MagicTux said it. 
@_date: 2011-07-07 21:16:20
Also he said he dropped it but it's not true the process is still going on.
If no one  oppose it (I think in 30 days) he will still get the trademark.

At this point it can be anything. It can be real hackers, it can be a hoax, it can be mtgox management pushing some rumors to stop the bleeding of their users.
@_date: 2011-06-21 01:06:18
First what is your question? The reverse situation of what if I was who?
Anyway. This is not stealing. People should stop using the word stealing for every fucking thing. It's overcharging your customers with crappy products. It's perfectly legal but not the best long term business strategy for building your brand. I personally would not work there.
Still many idiots do buy Monster cables.
@_date: 2011-06-20 03:34:17
I just watched a live interview with people from mtgox and they claim that the hackers only transferred $1000.  The interviewer asked yeah but at what price and how many bitcoins? The mtgox dude hesitated and said around 200 bitcoins. So maybe they averted the worst.
They claim that the 430k was them (mtgox) transferring the founds to a secured wallet to prevent theft.
They also claim that the reason they were hacked is because an external firm that they hired to do a financial audit got their computer hacked. 
Unfortunately their explanation on why the fuck a financial auditor have access on his own computer to the database of all emails, logons and password was not really convincing.
@_date: 2011-06-20 00:58:59

Let me just repeat a little less diplomatically. 
You are making shit up.
MagicalTux said absolutely nowhere that Kevin placed the order before the hack, you are the only one making this up. However if you think that he say it could you please prove me wrong and provide the exact quote. Because it is not in the link you provided. Maybe you should read it again.

According to an interview it was a financial auditor. 
If they hire a security auditor the first question he would ask is "Why the fuck do the financial auditor have access to the password database?"
@_date: 2011-06-27 17:33:31


You mean the guy who bought MtGox a couple of months ago.
@_date: 2011-06-21 01:33:48


No word on that and I am pretty sure if it was the case MagicTux would show it.
If the buy order was placed minutes before the crash then I would be first to say that this is extremely suspicious. But that he placed it during the crash? Well there is probably 100s of people of placed bids during the crash but he won because:
1 - He was there at the right time (like anyone who was also there)
2 - He was wise enough to apply "price is right" game theory and place his bet at 0.0101 and outsmart the people who placed bets at 0.01
By the way what about all the people who placed bets at 0.01? There is even someone here on reddit who say he won 1300 bitcoins at that price.
@_date: 2011-06-28 02:45:35
The thing is that this flood of buyers came thanks to the coverage in the news and the fact that it was novelty.
@_date: 2011-06-20 04:01:27


It's $1000 per day. So 50 bitcoins when the value of the bitcoin is $20. When the value of the bitcoin is $0.01 (like it was for a couple of minutes) then it's suddenly 100K bitcoins.
@_date: 2011-08-06 11:11:08
Well, in a way if it's really the case I can certainly see how the owner must be freaking the shit out. :/ 
@_date: 2011-06-22 15:58:13
So you admit your a making it up and that's why you are not able to provide the quote right?
@_date: 2011-06-20 00:27:48
Someone took control of the whole database of accounts and passwords he then either:
a) found an account with 500K bitcoins
b) consolidated mutiple accounts into a big one with 500K bitcoins
He then did two things: He placed a buy order on a second account for 500K bitcoins at $0.01 and then placed a sell order at $0.01 in the original hacked account.
The kind of funny thing is that at that exact moment, every single person in world who had a buy order for more than $0.01 automatically got them executed so the system started processing them by lowering the price each time lower and lower until every single buy order anywhere between $0.01-$17.00 was done then sold the rest to the hacker's account at the price of $0.01. Just look the market crash down live to $0.01 on that video.
The market recovered pretty quickly so he had to transfer the bitcoins pretty fast but if he did transfer then when they were 0.01 he was then able to transfer $1000/0.01 or 100K bitcoins. Now that the value is up again those 100K bitcoins are worth about 1.7 million dollars.
@_date: 2011-06-20 17:48:58

@_date: 2011-06-20 23:41:26
No, you can't rollback bitcoins transactions but this not exactly the case. 
The mtgox market is outside of the bitcoin algorithm transaction network. when you trade on mtgox you give them you bitcoins and they archive them somewhere in their own wallet. The exchanges are made on their own software that they control, not on the bitcoin network. 
It's like if you bough World of Warcraft gold and start trading and playing it inside their game. They can control every transaction as long as it was inside "their game." So they are perfectly capable of resetting the transactions inside mtgox, not problem.
It's only once you cash out from mtgox that they put back your bitcoins on the real bitcoin network to your wallet. That's why they are capable of rolling back the trades but they won't be able to take back any money that was cashed out of mtgox. 
@_date: 2011-06-22 16:14:56
Yeah I've read that log. Maybe you  should read it again.
__He never said he placed the order before__ you are the one saying it. This only only says that he __logged before__ the hacker started selling. There was probably hundreds of people who also logged before the crash. Are they all accomplices?

You have a good point. The market was not ready to accommodate this incredible influx of wealth and investors and the infrastructure was not appropriate.  A couple of month month ago this project was merely a  funny hobby with little capital. When it suddenly turned into a gold mine it really tested the limits of the existing infrastructure and even the big players didn't even have time to improve security mechanisms things happened too fast.
Having a little break will give time to build a couple of stronger security mechanism.

You can't transfer more than 1000$ so it's technically impossible for the people with the biggest accounts to impulsively transfer everything in one day. 
This rule will certainly help MtGox because after a couple of days some people may decide to simply stay because it's easier.

Words are just that words. They evolve and change meaning. In the end it's not an exact science because there is arbitrary interpretation at every single level of how we experience and see the world. However for the sake of trying to communicate it's better to at least try to be specific when we use them. Why call something theft when it's not really theft? Stealing is taking something from someone else and depriving him from his property. However it's very current to bastardize it's usage with the obvious goal of emotionally charging the situation and tilt public opinion in favor of the victim of something that is not theft but is just close enough to get away with incorrectly using the word.

I am happy that they are doing a thorough job and they changed their first decision. However maybe the only reason you received help is because your post was preeminently displayed on r/bitcoin. So do anyone with a problem now needs to voice their complain in the form of a submission to reddit? 
In any case it's still a very good thing that MtGox read and act on the inputs of this community I am just saying that I hope that they are fair with everyone equally.

I am in the same boat and have being trying different ways and each time something happened that blocked my attempts. (until I resigned myself to go the overpriced way)
First there is this Canadian exchange that is very promising but unfortunately they decided to stop taking deposits while they are in beta :(
 (oops I just saw your comment, I'll leave it here for the others)
Then there is paxum.com a Canadian company that do business with mtgox. I was about to go that way when the Mtgoxapocalypse happened and I am not too sure now.
So I finally said fuck it, I just want a couple of coins even if I overpay for them so I went to ebay and [searched for bitcoin]( and found a vendor who was selling them pretty overpriced (around $22) throught Paypal but fuck it I just wanted 2 so I could play in the system. It went fine and received them half an hour after paying for them.
Now I just discovered this  , it gives you emails of potential vendors and buyer in your area by postal code (to see people around you, you need to submit your own ad first) Good luck.
