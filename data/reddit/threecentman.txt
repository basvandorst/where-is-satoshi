No Neo, I'm trying to tell you that when you're ready... you can't.

Asking people for 50 cents with nothing in return is what beggars do.
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:13:47
Which is, of course, a super realistic scenario.
@_date: 2018-05-18 22:51:41
This is the most retarded sub in the history of reddit. Wow. Well done.
@_date: 2018-06-16 17:17:09
Good one.
@_date: 2018-06-16 14:38:17
Europeans are less retarded.
@_date: 2018-06-27 11:31:51
4k in the hole! Wow, congratulations!
@_date: 2018-03-30 21:11:18
And how's your German, dipshit?
@_date: 2018-02-09 19:25:07
You're not 'investing' in anything.
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:21:09
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:21:31
Fuck that, I'm just here for the filthy fiat!
@_date: 2018-02-04 21:52:43
As opposed to your deep analysis. Haha.
@_date: 2018-02-06 22:37:57
Does using Bitcoin actually actively make you retarded?
@_date: 2018-02-02 19:36:52
What 'major companies'?
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:36:16
You're from Rotterdam? I'm disappointed...
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:23:29
You're forgetting all the filthy fiat that's coming my way for trolling butters.
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:19:25
Hey bro, I'm just trying to make a living here.
@_date: 2018-02-09 21:42:29
You do you, bubba.
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:14:23
There's just one possible response...
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:17:09
Hehe, looks like we're getting testy over here!
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:27:20
Bitcoin Ass? Goddamnit, did I miss the airdrop?!
@_date: 2018-02-09 19:28:34
Nobody is 'seriously investing' in crypto. We have degenerate gamblers, moronic millennials, and a handful of delusional libertarians.
@_date: 2018-12-09 15:01:28
Unacceptable according to your libertarian ideals? Huh? Anyway, selling Bitcoin is the only smart play here, so go get 'em, Supermarket Guy.
@_date: 2018-12-27 13:22:39
Be your own bank, they said. No regulation, they said. It will be better, they said. SFYL, they said.
@_date: 2018-12-21 22:26:44
Jesus, are you guys actually actively getting dumber or are we just posting buzzwords for easy karma?
@_date: 2018-12-05 15:26:44
Or... it could let you see the light and make a good decision.
@_date: 2018-12-09 15:05:46
Just when I thought it couldn't get any more retarded, you guys keep surprising me.
@_date: 2018-12-27 13:25:40
LMAO, they said.
@_date: 2018-12-27 13:24:05
Great reason to go into filthy fiat and put it in the bank.
@_date: 2018-12-09 14:54:41
Haha! Man, I've enjoyed browsing here for some time now, but these last few weeks have been absolute comedy gold. Keep em coming, guys!
