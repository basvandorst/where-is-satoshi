Ok thanks.
Is there some way to just have the ubuntu OS install on the CD?
@_date: 2014-02-28 17:57:17
Why didn't I think of that and do it !...
But yes I did do that.. thanks for your concern?
@_date: 2014-02-28 14:34:59
Yeah basically I just want to be able to run electrum under ubuntu, but from what I've read won't I have to install the OS to get that far? Thanks for your help so far.

thank you kind sir, stupidly even if you make a new wallet it still opens default_wallet so I sent my btc to that and was a little scared when the password I used wasn't the one for 'default_wallet' but instead for 'Wallet' where my btc weren't stored... Was a scary few minutes try different password till i finally remembered it and moved to the one where I had my seed written down, thanks ~

What do you even do with $59 million dollars in crypto coins.. how would you even cash it out so to speak.
@_date: 2017-08-17 14:31:23
Are you literally or perhaps even figuratively shaking!?!

As is reddit tradition.
@_date: 2019-12-31 16:53:21
Yeah well those days may never come again who really knows.
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:35:39
Yup, much cheaper fees and faster transactions HAS to count for something miner politics aside .. next few months going to very interesting regarding the prices with BTC and BCH
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:38:38
People just wanting validation from the masses, no way in hell I'd be selling BCH at the moment.

Assuming this is real how would you go about cashing ALL of them out, what exchange is going to cash out $4 million dollars and how? 
Always something I've wondered.
@_date: 2018-12-20 10:23:55
People were convinced the bottom was in at 9k.. then 7k.. then 5k etc
No one knows, anyone who says they know is lying to themselves and you.

Yes sent a support ticket about 2 weeks ago and said they'd fast track my application ...
