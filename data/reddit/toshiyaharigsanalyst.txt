Here's my bet, it won't drop below $12000 because the big boys want an easily manipulatable "asset" to survive (aka not crash) so they can keep all of you little players on the Ferris wheel so they can keep beating you around the bush with futures.

Your post made me tear up. That was beautifully written.

It's only meant to be for "everyone" because you'd like the boost to your wallet. Stop pretending like your pseudo-altruistic viewpoint is fueled by anything other than greed.
A majority of people couldn't care less for a volatile string of numbers that takes 10-30 minutes to process along with a fee of $10-50, not backed by anything other than the confidence of everyone else on the Ferris wheel.
It's the fact that crypto needs to constantly rope in new people and generate hype in order to survive because the moment people stop buying and everyone starts selling, something founded entirely on extrinsic value will go to zero.

There's bitcoin's problem, think on it before spending another cent.

You have to realize that Bitcoin is fueled entirely on hype and confidence (no intrinsic value unlike shares, where you own part of a company), so if you undermine their hype efforts - speculators will understandably react negatively since they're always tethering on the edge of a crash/rally with their savings on the line potentially losing 99% of its value. Its value is tied to how much confidence/hype/interest in the "get rich quick crowd" it generates.
The way crypto speculators behave is like how people pump and dump penny stocks, constantly trying to push their coins etc just to sell it off on any sort of rally with the disadvantage of not being able to mechanically short properly (futures aren't because they don't directly affect the quantity/supply of the underlying aka.a derivative). I mean look at this sub, just one tweet from Jack Dorsey and there are already 3-4 threads about it.

I personally think it's too volatile and hard/risky to adopt to be a mainstay currency. A lot of the elderly and skeptics just won't commit to putting their money into a string of numbers hoping they can use it to trade with a very very small % of the economy for goods and services when they can just tap their credit card or Apple watch with ApplePay at the moment and spare themselves the inconvenience.
I'm not saying Bitcoin might not be future of currency, just that I personally don't believe in crypto unless it's backed by a government or financial institution with actual $$. Remember bitcoin's value is tied to how much it's worth in USD but the opposite isn't true.

One asset has intrinsic value, the other doesn't. Let that sink in before posting anything financially-related again, OP.

Just wait for countries to announce their own cryptocurrencies, the tech is currently there without any proper "credible" backing beyond the hopes and dreams of a bunch of hopefuls/hypocrites that pretend they're doing this for the greater good when they're more interested in seeing the price go up so they make a profit.
