MistaCoin, when was the last time you bought BTC from them?
@_date: 2019-03-16 20:46:24
I just agreed. RIP me. It was nice while it lasted guys.
Peace.

How would they know how much BTC I have? I just use it as an alarm for when the price goes over a certain point... 
@_date: 2018-10-23 18:09:54
No. I only noticed this after uploading. Not sure. Could be a reflection. It don't see it in real life. :s

Oh OK, so you gave OP a shit answer not because you're an uneducated noob or lack any intelligence, you just don't want him to use BTC... 
@_date: 2018-10-23 18:46:46
Haha come on too paranoid man. That's like saying don't wear an expensive suit on wall street... Those bitcoin cufflinks don't make the difference, at least now.
Maybe if bitcoin was at $100,000 I'd be more cautious cos it would make the news again...

My dad is paranoid, and from experience I can tell you, he doesn't live life to its fullest. 
@_date: 2018-10-23 22:50:32
I know I didn't. But nice catch. 
@_date: 2018-10-31 13:33:22
Stop crying, old man. All you could come up with is "fuck the banks, enough being their slave". - that's a bad answer that's not gonna bring OP to use Bitcoin which means your answer is useless and a waste of everybody's time.
@_date: 2018-10-30 15:36:28
OP asked an intelligent question. If you can't answer it then fuck off, you uneducated noob. 
@_date: 2018-10-31 13:27:32
Lol you deleted your answer out of shame... And you know nothing about Bitcoin and disrespected OP... 
@_date: 2018-10-23 19:43:01
Thanks, friend.
@_date: 2019-02-13 12:54:40
She looks beautiful.

Dude, you got issues.
So judgmental.
What do you even know about the guy?
If anything, you're the greedy one, blaming noobs for your own investment failures. If you were successful, you wouldn't take your anger out on this guy.
You should be ashamed of yourself.

Are you being sarcastic? I guess I'll have to repost this as my question is aimed towards the title of the article...
