kept thinking the plane was going to back into something

Why is this comment not 50 points ahead??
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:56:58
use gdax
@_date: 2017-11-17 21:42:05
Haha the homework was last night, the question was written quite a while before (obviously).
@_date: 2017-11-17 21:42:54
Yeah you're probably right.  I told him to spend less time drawing faces on the page..

I'm going to try and convince some folks around the Thanksgiving table.  My grandpa recently passed away and he was a big coin collector.  His estate was split amongst his kids so I'll try to convince my mom to put [some of] her inheritance into digital coins.

No issues with Capital One either

"On the downside, if the value of Bitcoin ever crashes, you won't be able to heat your home by burning it"

yeah that was tongue-in-cheek.  kind of joking he could use the parent's electricity since they wouldn't let him directly buy
@_date: 2017-11-05 13:19:56
don't leave the backup under your kid's pillow!!
@_date: 2017-11-05 13:21:37
just spray with WD-40
@_date: 2017-11-17 21:40:51
Yeah he's 9. I've been teaching him about cryptocurrencies so he was excited and had to come show me

setup a miner
@_date: 2017-09-08 15:56:11
mine said WTF is a *bit coin*???
@_date: 2017-10-11 23:48:31
what is the address?  look it up on the blockchain and see
@_date: 2017-10-16 21:47:25
I like how the box is all ripped up.  Mine is like that too!  I guess they do that so you could tell if somebody opened it before you.  I thought I was doing something wrong trying to wrestle it open
@_date: 2017-09-14 16:30:30
if you're losing money to mine them (electricity cost more than you're getting in coinage), you'd be better off to just buy them!

I agree with you and am boycotting NFL also.  I'm enjoying my free time on Sunday afternoons
@_date: 2017-10-11 23:45:28
addresses don't "expire"

sorry but it is pascal.  should've converted to something more mainstream apparently!  
@_date: 2018-04-26 14:35:59
Yes, pascal.  that's what we use at work for various reasons.  I've started trying to learn some more updated languages; Pascal doesn't really impress anybody on a resume..
@_date: 2018-04-26 14:35:22
wrong.  it is pascal!
