Visa went down and I am in U.K., I just used MasterCard. The Cuba thing still doesn't make sense, you should prepare better before travelling, to the point that you would know how to access money.
Bitcoin isn't an insurance policy and none of the scenarios above are stopping you from purchasing bitcoin when you need it

That's a pretty specific problem, I also like how you plan to buy a return ticket with the cash you carry there

Banks in the UK do instant inter-bank transfers when it's between accounts that send to each other. The reason they normally delay the funds is to give you a chance to cancel the request since when something has been paid you legally can't get the money back unless the person on the other side consents. Ugh there's a reason we use banks, they help with lots of things like buying houses and keeping our money safe and protecting us with insurance. In the UK banks are so competitive you normally get benefits with your free accounts and better rates if you get your salary paid into it.

This is it really, bitcoin isn't fit for purpose as a payment processor as of now. When something comes along that is it will overtake bitcoin but we just don't have the tech yet .
Also a lot of companies just won't accept bitcoin due to the nature of it . It's like asking why Google doesn't index the dark web, because you don't want to be involved with where it's coming from

They really are cheap, definitely cheaper than bitcoin right now with the lack of liquidity and fees tacked on by the exchanges to convert from one currency into bitcoin and then from bitcoin to the destination currency

Obviously Bitcoin comes across better than a fucking cheque
@_date: 2017-10-26 16:03:07
yeah, would have been cheaper if you flew it yourself as well

I work in the industry I know what you talking about. A photo of your id is all that is required and most systems will automatically pass you without any human intervention

it's not just the same because of the "market cap" of Btc, the total value of the network has increase by 10% in both scenarios but in the latter 10% of the network is a much much much bigger number

Because you're a money launderer? There's some basic checks they do to ensure you aren't one that most people with a bank account and address pass

What's the difference between a bitcoin payment processor and a remitter, they aren't cheaper if you want to send dollars to Hong Kong for example
@_date: 2017-10-26 15:02:27
okay but usually you're not making international payments with cheques these days, it isn't the 90s.
There are services out there that will do international payments hassle free and for quite a low charge considering.
I.e. Western Union, TransferWise, Xe, WorldRemit, Revolut.
Banks are already getting disrupted by these services. You know what Bitcoin can't do and Visa, MasterCard and Amex can. Process a fucking payment in a matter of seconds anywhere you are in the world. There's a reason you centralise massive payment networks. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 08:46:57
Western union is definitely the worst out there because they have the strongest brand but the rest have to build their brands on service.


Bitcoin has split twice this year and each time the people doing the splitting have made money off it, there's incentive to keep splitting the coin and selling off the new coins to some idiot who can't tell the difference. 
The blockchain is a great technology but there's so much bitcoin can't do that traditional banks and remitters can. The great thing about it is the anonymity but at the same time it's the greatest weakness. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 23:24:22
What then? When will be get there? When bitcoin has divided into 20 different coins?
You don't need to queue for these services as they're all digital but you wouldn't know that because you haven't done any research
@_date: 2017-10-26 15:13:46
Yeah agreed, I work in that industry and there's a shit load of regulation and complication around it so I wouldn't be surprised that banks charge a premium so they don't have to do it
@_date: 2018-04-18 15:03:51
it is, I have seen it too many times
@_date: 2018-12-10 09:37:00
It is a bit more complicated than that though, there are many factors that affect how a coin can grow which is why we're always getting forks of coins. I think the major driver last year was the bubble which affected all coins almost equally. This guy's reasoning for getting Lite over Bitcoin was pointless though
