No, it exploits a bug in bitcoin to make it seem like a btc address is a burn address. Instead, the creator has full control and could spend the coins.

The same thing happened to us. Without any regard for the consequences (we are running a trading bot which made losses due to the ban) they revoked our previously verified status.

The api already has its own rate limits, so there shouldn't be additional protection.

Nice! The probability of getting my 4btc back has increased from epsilon to 2*epsilon.

What do mean by failing? Do you receive a JSON object? If so, the request was at least successfully received by bitstamp. 
It could be that in your code an error if raised if, say, the returned object is not valid JSON. In that case you miss the HTML message that is returned (if you don't save the result).

4 btc :(

I don't know if they seriously think they can get away with stealing our money and fleeing to a new location. They must know that at least some of their customers are hardened criminals that have just lost tens of thousands of dollars.
If they don't give our money back, they will probably be dead in a few months.

You can actually buy a train ticket with Bitcoin in Switzerland.

They are not printing money. Only recently did they do that to prevent deflation. Besides, printing money does not make the debt go away.

This brings back bad memories.

I tried to introduce a friend to btc and as a test he submitted some money to me. I received 1.25 USD. This money is now dead money, since the fee is higher than my account balance. 
Fucking bullshit.

How can I specify a custom fee in electrum? I know there is the slider, but I cannot put in a number myself.
