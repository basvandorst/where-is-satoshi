Tip for noobs:
Always keep some Fiat ready to buy up a dip.

Yeah, resumes trading so the Government can sell their shiny new Bitcoin stack.
I cant believe it...

I need 7k
@_date: 2018-05-05 09:44:09
this FOMO shit is always there, when btc gets to 10k. It will revert, no need to rush and make stupid decisions 
@_date: 2018-03-16 10:39:18
Finally, it has arrived!
@_date: 2018-03-14 10:34:29
Ha, so it is not only in Russia people mine bitcoins on government owned computers.

Damn, I have just started to guess a private key for 	16rCmCmbuWDhPjWTrpQGaU3EPdZF7MTdUk
@_date: 2018-03-16 10:31:50

We are not sure whether Liberland will survive but they already adopted bitcoin...interesting to see where everything is going to go
@_date: 2018-02-25 07:58:55
I must admit we should all thanks this guys because those who HODL because rich

The result would always be opposite.

Maybe look for ICOs that are now big projects and get in touch with them directly
@_date: 2018-02-26 11:39:20
exactly my point
@_date: 2018-02-19 11:27:02
Stupid move. Such fud creates a different effect and will help to spread a word about crypto
@_date: 2018-04-02 10:53:36
Well done, daddy! A nice present option would be to print the private key on a metal coin :)

@_date: 2018-04-02 10:55:00
Nice attempt, easydns
@_date: 2018-04-02 10:56:05
I think we will revisit 6k and maybe a bit lower but 7k is a good price
@_date: 2018-04-02 10:59:04
ja das ist gut
@_date: 2018-04-02 10:56:25
