I took everyones' advice and made an account on Circle. I guess a few days to verify an account is as quick as it gets. Are there any that accept Discover?

From what I can tell it sounds like people/companies are just going to be tipping random people who tweet about the game. Is this correct?
@_date: 2014-11-20 11:46:02
I went ahead and signed up on circle and it's telling me it will be a few days before verification and that was after giving them tons of personal info and my bank information. It seems like there is a high barrier for entry.

You hot the nail on the head about why there is no discount for cash. Coin bus ate very expensive for Walmart and Sam's Club. Having staff to count the money is time consuming and expensive as well. This is so true that GE Capital (the company who runs Walmart and Sam's credit cards) is cheaper for Walmart to accept than cash, even with the transaction fees.

Someone up above claims he has received and accepted changetips. Obviously he would have a basic understanding of how they work if he has accepted them.

Please excuse my ignorance, but what dream job are you talking about?

I know about football and that this is a corporate sponsorship, what I don't get is how tipping relates to a college football game.

This is an exciting explanation for how the tipping came about.

How does he accidentally tip a beer if he know how to use  ChangeTip?

I can't wait to get back into programming some. This looks awesome.

Could this be why we have seen a ~50% price jump since the recent dip to $180/btc? It makes me happy that I picked up a full coin a couple of weeks ago.
@_date: 2015-01-26 14:21:07
Yep, I just looked at the charts and came to that conclusion right after I posted. Due to that fact, I bought another 1/2 coin in expectation of the rise.
Note, I am no investor or speculator. I'm just playing it smart and still 100% willing to lose what I have in btc.

I meant over creditors/vendors. I'm not really sure what sort of liabilities they would have out like that though.
@_date: 2015-01-15 15:28:06
What trim? Those things have crazy different prices depending on that

I don't know how Japan works, but in the US, my understanding is that customers have a higher priority to cash.

I wouldn't be surprised if people claim this announcement is what made the final push over $800/coin.

We pay a company to handle out IT and also contract an outside individual for a ton of work at any hour of the day (I've literally been on the phone with him at 4:30 and seen him at the plant at 7pm despite him living several states away). I'm sure we spent more fixing it than we would have paying the ransom.

The company I work for (a family owned manufacturing business) had their network brought to its knees with a ransomware virus that was downloaded automatically through a link from seemingly legit spam email. They didn't pay the ransom and ended up restoring the entire network (and our terminal servers for a terminal client environment) from a backup a couple of weeks old. Thankfully all user files were retained, but it's a serious threat and is pretty low risk/effort for scammers.

Cash is actually more expensive for a business to handle than a company card. At least that is what the GE capital director was telling me when I used to work at Sam's Club. Cash requires armored car service, change service, and employees to count and verify the stuff.

This about it the other way, that is 20BTC. It would be terrible if sending 20BTC was an everyday occurrence.

is monitored by T-Mobile reps. It might be worth cross posting there and requesting some expansion to the US.
@_date: 2015-03-25 22:10:04
The post doesn't say why though. Are they counterfeit, not delivering, or stealing wallets?

So, when can I pay my plan with Bitcoin in the states? I only pay $33/with tax which is awesome. Sometimes I go over my minutes and I was thinking just the other day that it would be awesome if I could pay my bill and top up with BTC. It would just be so much more convenient than my (currently) automatically linked credit card. 
@_date: 2015-03-11 21:13:53
I was dreaming just this week about them doing that. It would be more convenient than my credit card that autorenews my plan.

It is ironic because these are the exact types of laws that our government's architecture is supposed to prevent.

I just checked and I'm not sure if it is the CAD to USD conversion, but coin is a bit cheaper to buy from there with the 2% fee than coinbase. $100 USD would be get about .4317 btc but SpendBT would net about .459 btc. That is ~5% difference.

Thank you for looking into the situation. I already saw the email and was getting ready to reply that the issue has been resolved.

Changtip has a standard amount. You can say for you my friend, one answer and it should send 42 cents to you.

They could roll out two apps. One that is in the store and one that isn't. The one in the store no longer has the trade feature, but points to the free one from their website with a link to an FAQ for interested parties (the FAQ describing why the app has to be side-loaded). Most users would either understand or not care about the local trading feature.

I have never used Circle to transfer BTC to another person.
@_date: 2015-02-04 00:22:25
No worries man. I like the answer because of course, you are tipping the answer to life, the universe, and everything with such a simple comment. 42 is indeed the answer.

Are those tags automatic in this sub? It's a pretty neat feature honestly.
