All Ponzi schemes are unsustainable financial scams, but not all unsustainable financial scams are Ponzi schemes.

Especially considering recent events....

What leads you to believe that Mt. Gox is a Ponzi scheme? They weren't paying old investors using money from new investors. In fact, they are a Bitcoin exchange and don't have investors at all, which goes against the entire definition of Ponzi scheme.
They may be a sketchy business that ends up running away with a lot of people's money, but that doesn't make them a Ponzi scheme.

Wouldn't worst possible outcome be that no ever gets any money at all?

Because a lot of major news outlets have run the Mt. Gox story, Bitcoin is a top trending search on Google and reddit has a strong Bitcoin community?

Not quite. Unlike an investment scheme, Mt. Gox operates an exchange and so they are not supposed to touch user deposits unless they are collecting transaction fees.
If they spent 50% of the coins, they would have committed criminal [embezzlement]( since they are spending money that does not belong to them.

If a person offers a investment opportunity to an investor, they are expected to spend the investor's money. 
In this case, Mt. Gox is advertised as a Bitcoin exchange, so they are not supposed to touch their user's money at all, except to collect transaction fees. If they are accessing and spending user deposits, that would constitute criminal [embezzlement]( since they are misappropriating money that does not belong to them.

I'll try to explain a bit more about why I think Mt. Gox is best classified as something other than a Ponzi scheme.
**Ponzi scheme:**
Ponzi schemes are advertised as lucrative investment opportunities that promise high interest returns. Old investors are paid these high interest returns using the money from new investors. Eventually, the scheme falls apart when the rate of new investors falls. 
Ponzi schemes are illegal because the entire business model is unsustainable. Even if you ran it perfectly, the scheme would still fall apart eventually.
**Mt. Gox:**
Mt. Gox operates a Bitcoin exchange. There's nothing inherently unsustainable about a Bitcoin exchange. Exchanges are supposed to make money from transaction fees and if you ran it perfectly, the exchange could last indefinitely. Mt. Gox has high transaction fees, so it's not like they are making promises that are too good to be true. 
However, just because they *could* run it perfectly, doesn't mean they are. In fact they appear to be doing quite a bad job.
**Is Mt. Gox a Ponzi scheme?**
Mt. Gox has been accepting money but has not been allowing withdrawals. This suspicious behaviour is often observed in Ponzi schemes. However, this happens in a number of financial scams, not just Ponzi schemes.
Mt. Gox is not supposed to touch user's deposits, and their source of revenue should be transaction fees. If they have been accessing and spending user's deposits, that seems to be the result of criminal embezzlement rather than a Ponzi scheme.

Just because they went offline does not make them a Ponzi scheme. You often see the head person disappear in financial scams in general. Ponzi scheme has a specific definition and this would not meet the criteria.

It's worth infinitely more!
