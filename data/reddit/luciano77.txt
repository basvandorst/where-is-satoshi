I can send them all the proof. For some reason these questions are not answered. Looks like all the money on Polish bank account is stolen by criminal "investigators" who are still "looking into the matter".

Good question. They are trying to hide it. Notice that all SEPA deposits were directed to the Polish bank. That bank account is basicly what was used by all European customers. That bank account had at least a few million euros, could be more.
It's not only we, who deposited before the collapse, but everyone who had fiat balance is getting robbed, because the bank account is not listen in assets all.
Something shady is going on.

I wired a large sum of money to Polish bank account that belonged to MtGox. MtGox closed the same day I wired the money. I called the bank two days later and the money were received. Why wasn't my balance updated? Who is going to steal my money? It is trustee or Kraken?

I pulled out everything using Dogecoin. I had several bitcoins worth of LTC that I tried to withdraw and also a BTC withdrawal. But they didn't move to my wallet for days, being in pending mode. I started to worry, found this thread and cancelled them to buy DOGE. DOGE withdrawals were fast.

I just pulled out everything out of Cryptsy just so I could sleep better.
