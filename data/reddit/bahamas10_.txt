Were you not in insert mode? I've had this happen a couple of times when pasting things in where the first couple of characters don't make it... it typically won't show the characters I wanted until it sees an `i` or an `a` character to get it into the correct mode.  Personally, I always try to `:set paste` before pasting in to cut down on any possible weirdness.

Awesome read, glad to hear everything is starting to look up for you man.  You'll definitely hear a lot of hodl advice here, and I know that's already fairly ingrained in your head, but make sure you always choose personal and mental stability first.  Good luck with whatever comes next for you!

hahaha.  hey man, once we pass 17k, then everyone on that rocket ship wins :).  for real though, i bought at various points as it fell, so my “break even” point is ~7.5k so i’m actually in the positive right now!  i like the tech and i trust bitcoin
edit: one -&gt; once

came here to say this lmao

I'm sure some banks are different, but depending on the ATM, some banks will charge 1. a fee for withdrawing from a foreign ATM and 2. a fee for using their ATM on a foreign bank...
basically, i'll get hit with a fee from the ATM itself, and also on my bank account for using a foreign ATM.  It's usually 2-4$ for the fee.

ha, i moved back home to Buffalo NY a couple years ago (from San Francisco) but kept my Chase bank account because of how much I liked the web interface and mobile app.  Same story, went from ATMs *all over* to, the closest one being an hour away.  Transferred some money from Chase to another bank and it took ~2 weeks to fully settle (no issues, just slow).
Compare that to using a local bitcoin ATM and having it go from pending to 1 confirmation in *the next block mined*... so yeah, this post resonates pretty heavily with me :)

So, I keep track of how much BTC I've purchased and how much USD I've put into it.  Because I've purchased along the way, even though my first investment was at 17k, I'm currently only down to around 48% of my original investment.  My "break even" point is currently ~7,500 USD - If bitcoin gets to that price then I will be even with the amount of USD I put into it.
If i sold now, I could realize my losses lol... but for now I'll hold on.  I can't speak for others, but I only put in money I was comfortable losing completely.  When I say "comfortable" i mean it wouldn't kill me and I wouldn't lose sleep over it... but I would still be some what upset ha.

�� thank you friend! my first ever tip ��.
i’ll look into setting up a lightning node next! my full node is currently syncing the blockchain as we speak (50gb roughly so far!)
@_date: 2019-01-23 17:12:08
I added a new Bitcoin address to my personal blog last week and got my first donation today... no idea who it's from.  Thank you kind stranger :).
@_date: 2019-01-11 02:56:18
yep :).  it was silly for me to get into when I did... but I'm now glad I did.  Sure, of course I wish I had gotten in sooner when the price was lower and I could have gotten more, but hindsight is always 20:20.  But for now, I'm glad I'm learning the tech and seeing just how cool Bitcoin actually is!

came here to say this - glad to see it's the top comment.

bought at 17k.
again at 11k.
again at 6k.
again at 4k.
it hurt at first, but the more i learn about the tech (I just got bitcoind compiled to run a full node) the better it gets.  I prefer to have more coins (I like seeing the amount of BTC I have go up) rather than compare it to the relative value in USD.
Personally, I just like seeing more opportunities come up to actually spend my BTC and trade in BTC... basically more opportunities to use it like a currency.
Edit: I went to dinner and just checked the responses I got on it... thank you everyone for all of the tips :) I'm going to look into setting up a lightning node now!
Edit 2: My node is about halfway done pulling the full blockchain (been running for ~6 hours)!
    $ ./src/bitcoin-cli --datadir=/home/dave/foo getblockchaininfo | json verificationprogress initialblockdownload

I saved the block data to `~/foo` just for testing :p.  once it's fully synced up I'll move the data dir to something more obvious than `foo` lol.

There was a small fee associated with it, but using an ATM i was able to slide $20 bills in, hold up a QR code, and buy bitcoin that way with no other forms of verification required.  USD in/BTC to an address.  it was really that simple that even i was shocked.

thank you kind stranger :)
@_date: 2019-01-04 03:49:08
oh that could be interesting... also really difficult ha
@_date: 2019-01-03 19:24:17
thanks :).
I was recently going through the process of trying to make a paypal donate button for a non-business account and about 10 minutes in I thought "this is just too difficult. it's not worth it, and they'll just charge me a fee too."  Bitcoin really is just so easy to "setup" (copy+paste a receive address).
@_date: 2019-01-03 19:11:33
I make music as a hobby and decided in 2017 to build and host a dedicated website to release it all for free and accept donations.
At the beginning of 2018 I removed the paypal donate link on my site and replaced it with a bitcoin and litecoin address.  I made 0.0039175 BTC (~15 USD currently) last year which is more than I made when I had the paypal link up!  It's not a ton (I don't do it for the money) but it's really cool to see people support my work with crypto :D.

thank you! I was confused at first when I saw this notification because I recognized your username, i thought "they already tipped me that amount...".  Then I realized you had tipped someone else but I had mistakenly thanked you for that (whoops!).  That will teach me to read the comments more carefully :p.  Either way, thank you for this :)
@_date: 2019-01-11 02:56:57
:) thank you!

It is open source!
- [GitHub repo](
- [Download and Changelog](
- [Wiki](
The documentation is a bit lacking IMO but you should be able to download an ISO or the USB image and go from there :).

Hey, no problem :)
[SmartOS]( is an operating system designed specifically to be a hypervisor meant to run as a  headless servers.  It is based on the [illumos]( kernel (fork of Open Solaris) and provides a really simple way to create and manage virtual machines using JSON manifest files.  In my blog post, I created a zone (think like a jail on FreeBSD, or a container on Linux) so `bitcoind` can run in complete isolation, with its own networking stack and service management framework.
It's a really cool OS and is definitely worth checking out if you like messing around with Unix operating systems :).  It's worth stating that I am currently employed the company that makes SmartOS so i'm almost certainly biased, but I was a fan of SmartOS before working there, and in fact *wanted* to work there specifically because I liked the tech.
