At the beginning he seemed to be talking about unencrypted packets traversing routers between Tor exit nodes and destination servers when accessing regular websites via Tor, but his description of the process was way off the mark and the issue has no relevance here anyway. Everything after that is uninformed, speculative drivel. There's nothing to clarify, really.

Just... give me a hug. Come on, now. It's okay.

Where is your evidence for these claims? I don't understand how you can spout this hysterical nonsense.

Starting with the fact that you don't know the difference between a server and a router, I'm going to politely suggest that you stop wasting everyone else's time and leave it there.

So did you Google that just now? Because not long ago you were talking about how traffic "often goes through several normal internet servers before hitting one that gets you into the tor network". That was the first, most obvious mistake in your post. Since not a single thing you said was based on real knowledge, informed research, or any effort to use correct terminologies, the burden is not on the rest of us to correct you line-by-line. Only to warn others that your post was unhelpful.

So because we don't know who Satoshi was, the NSA did it? You genuinely don't see the fallacy in your reasoning? Christ.

When did I mention wired magazine or bitcointalk? I think your thought processes are somewhat deranged.

You, sir, are talking out of your bum-trumpet.

What Silk Road products have you been consuming? Speculating "the CIA" would have "told" "Wallstreet" about the bust?
Sorry to break it to you, but for real money people like city bankers and forex traders, Bitcoin remains little more than a mildly interesting blip on the radar.
