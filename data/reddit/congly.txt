I am aware of what it means. you're saying bitcoin is not decentralized because it doesn't fulfill the exact definition or whatever your interpretation of the word is. decentralization is a spectrum and bitcoin is by far the most decentralized and immutable financial network in the world. this is a fact. if you don't agree, then give examples. otherwise, I'm done with this convo

you're thinking about it completely wrong. it's not the compatibility between addresses that is the issue; all address types are already compatible with each other. the issue is that wallets do not support all of the types yet
to send to a certain address type, the wallet has to create the transaction in a specific format. eg electrum supports bech32 so it can send and receive transactions to any type of address. no other wallet can currently send to a bech32 address because they don't even recognize the address type
let's say you had some btc stored on a mycelium legacy address. you can't send to a bech32 address using mycelium because mycelium doesn't support bech32 yet. but what you can do is import the private key for that address into electrum and then you can send the btc from the legacy address to a bech32 address using electrum. as you can see, it is not the addresses that are incompatible with each other, it's the wallet

transactions still contain the witness data. I've written a blockchain parser which deserializes every block and extracts any and all relevant information, so I know I'm correct
to be backwards compatible, non-segwit nodes will not contain the witness data and will therefore ignore segwit txns until they are included in a block. if you want to have all of the "necessary components of legal contracts", you can simply run a segwit node and have access to the signatures for every txn
if you reply to this, don't expect a reply from me back. like I said:


@_date: 2019-07-31 00:16:51
I think you misunderstand how confirmations work. If a transaction has 1 confirmation, that means it has been included in a block on the bitcoin blockchain. this confirmation cannot be fake. if you were to fork off the blockchain, any transactions you confirm on your new chain would be a confirmation only on that chain, and not the bitcoin blockchain. therefore, any confirmation received on the main bitcoin blockchain is a "real" confirmation". the potential of a double spend attack arises from a miner owning &gt;50% of the total hashing power, which is obviously much more than what you can buy for $50/day

using your node as a hot wallet with a small amount of btc is safe, in fact it is recommended since you can verify all transactions yourself and don't have to trust anyone. however, you should not store the majority of your btc on a machine connected to the internet. for long-term storage, look up cold storage methods
if your computer dies, you can still recover your btc. you can back up your private key(s), which can be used to recover your btc using almost any wallet. you can also backup your wallet.dat file which you can import to another full node

what do you mean by fake confirmation? if a transaction has a confirmation, by definition that means it has been included in a block which is part of the blockchain with the most work
also, by pointing your hash power towards a mining pool, you don't get to choose which transactions are included in a block
@_date: 2019-07-23 19:47:51
(simplified explanation)
the balances of addresses are recorded on the blockchain, a copy of which is stored on tens of thousands of computers (full nodes) worldwide. to prove that you can spend a certain bitcoin, you must provide the private key corresponding to the address of that bitcoin. hardware wallets simply store those private keys in a secure environment. the 24 word seed phrase allows you to generate those private keys at any time
to emphasize: bitcoins are not stored on your device (be it a hardware wallet or computer wallet). also, the private keys or seed phrase is all you need to access your bitcoins, so keep them safe

it's hard to understand why people don't get it because it's actually pretty simple
before bitcoin, there were many attempts at cryptocurrencies. ***every single one*** had inexpensive and fast transactions since they all used the internet. but they failed for one reason: they required a centralized authority to validate transactions 
bitcoin solved that
that is the ***only*** revolutionary aspect of bitcoin: reaching decentralized consensus
any cryptocurrency that sacrifices decentralization for speed is trying to achieve something that was already possible before 2009
so you can go to bch, bsv or any other shitcoin, which are all doomed to fail, or you can stay with bitcoin, be patient, and you can have it all: decentralization, immutability, security, speed, low fees

it's not the hash that is checked for the proof of work, it's the nonce. the idea is that the proof of work is difficult to generate but trivial to check. when a miner finds a nonce that works, everyone else can check that the nonce is valid

ok I mean we're just arguing semantics at this point. sure, running a full node doesn't directly affect the consensus rules for other users but it's still a way for users to "signal" their preferences, this is something you can't dispute. for example, when users updated to segwit nodes a few years back, they were "signaling" their support for an effective increase in blocksize without a hard fork, lower fees, fixing transaction malleability and at the same time rejecting block size increases and other short-sighted scaling solutions

then it's not redownloading the blockchain. it's scanning the blocks to create the transaction index
by default, bitcoin core only indexes some transactions, eg ones related to your wallet. of course, all transaction data is always stored in the blocks. but if you want to be able to quickly get information about any transaction (eg through the built-in rpc interface), you have to turn indexing on, which will make bitcoin core scan all of the blocks and extract information about every single transaction

bch's code is almost identical to bitcoin (by design, it was a fork after all), with slight modifications to consensus rules (i.e. bigger block limit), their eda algo and lack of segwit. increasing the block size, or shortening block time, is not an upgrade if it compromises other fundamental features of the coin. that would be like using a lighter chassis in a car to increase fuel economy while decreasing the safety rating

here's the thing... a blockchain is supposed to remove the need for trust in a transaction. but in a situation like they described, where it's a wealthy institution transacting with several wealthy investors, of course they already trust each other. if either party tried to cheat the other, there would be significant legal ramifications. the real power of a (decentralized) blockchain is more apparent when there is an asymmetry of trust between two parties, eg a central bank and a common citizen. the citizen has no choice but to trust and use the central bank's currency while the central bank has no reason to care at all for the citizen. when the central bank tries to cheat the citizen ("when", not "if"), what recourse does the citizen have?


so both parties trust this blockchain because it's supposed to be immutable but...


the immutability of their blockchain is dependent only on the two parties. there are 5 laptops in my household, I could just create my own blockchain running on 5 nodes and declare it to be immutable but it's completely pointless

segwit *does* make transactions smaller because since 0.13, fee calculation does not depend on transaction size but on weight. if the transaction is not segwit, the calculation results in the same fee as if it were still dependent on bytes. if you are interested in the technical details of bitcoin, then you have to stop thinking about transaction size in bytes; it's largely irrelevant now
segwit transactions have the same size in bytes as a non-segwit transaction but much lower size in weight. therefore, a 200 sat/byte segwit transaction would have the same priority as a 200 sat/byte non-segwit transaction but you end up paying much less
segwit is a method to effectively increase the block size without the need for a hard fork, which was thought to be impossible before segwit. it is literally software engineering genius

bitcoin is valuable because it is decentralized. no other reason. no coin can ever replicate the degree to which bitcoin is decentralized
besides, if a coin can supplant bitcoin, then one can argue that cryptocurrencies will never gain mass adoption. because if a coin comes out that is better than bitcoin, then another coin can be developed that is better than that one, and so on and so on. who wants to store their wealth in a cryptocurrency that will get replaced with another one eventually? luckily, we don't have to worry about that with bitcoin because of the reason above
it is a myth that other cryptocurrencies are "innovating". they are trying to do things that can be done more efficiently with pre-existing technologies. or their use case is predicated on the assumption that their network is decentralized, however they are anything but decentralized

@_date: 2018-08-06 16:23:52
and none of those apply to bitcoin (except the 51% attack but the risk and incentive structure of bitcoin ensures that it won't happen). it appears that you're relatively new to crypto so I'll summarize the crypto scene for you: 99.9% of altcoins are scams because they forgo decentralzation (the whole point of crypto) to give the appearance of having more utility. any arguments against other cryptos don't apply to bitcoin

   &gt; Reliance on a single version of truth by multiple stakeholders when individual records are error prone and the cost of lost or compromised data is very high

@_date: 2018-08-27 16:24:58
immutability is not an inherent feature of a blockchain. it is achieved only through decentralization
intermediaries are not eliminated if the blockchain is maintained by a central entity. to use a centralized blockchain, you would still have to trust people that don't give a shit about you
in a centralized blockchain, the entity that owns the network owns the data
distributed is not the same as decentralized. if one entity gets to determine which version of their blockchain is valid, then it doesn't matter how many servers their blockchain is stored on. that entity can, and will eventually, be hacked 
a blockchain is slower than contemporary database technologies. this is because blockchains trade efficiency to be decentralized. if a blockchain is not decentralized, then it has traded efficiency to gain nothing

no it doesn't. consensus by one homogeneous group is no consensus at all. a blockchain only adds value when consensus is reached by a decentralized network of users, all of whom have differing goals and incentives for participating in the network. by using a proprietary, private, permissioned blockchain, what these companies are doing is basically circle jerking each other

electricity is cheap in china and other places because they produce too much electricity
this is because they invested in infrastructure many decades ago, not because they're producing a surplus of electricity for the sole purpose of mining bitcoin
as bitcoin mining goes up, demand for electricity goes up and so does the price of electricity
this will cause some mining businesses to go bust

centralized coins are pointless
eg let's consider siacoin. it purports to be a decentralized storage platform secured by blockchain technology. so hypothetically we can use it to store anything we want; censorship-resistant and trustless cloud storage
but being based on a blockchain does not make it inherently secure. it is still centralized because it has a highly centralized team running it (with a ceo) that can be coerced or manipulated. what happens when the government finds out that people are storing illegal materials using siacoin? they will force the devs to take it down, thus destroying the entire purpose of it
on the other hand, if someone buys illegal contraband with bitcoin, the government can't do anything about it because there is no central entity to corrupt
there are no "pros" to centralized coins. a blockchain is a means to achieve decentralization. anything else is pointless
@_date: 2018-08-21 17:29:19
people who complain about slow adoption rate don't understand bitcoin. of course it's taking a long time. bitcoin is a decentralized network spread out over tens of thousands of computers and millions of users. to be decentralized, it must be slow and inefficient by design. if you want fast, go use paypal or visa or any shitcoin. their updates are instant and mandatory!

miners create a separate chain. people using spv wallets can get tricked into thinking they are transacting on the real chain when in reality they are using the false chain. the false chain eventually dies because it's secured by a token which no one wants. all transactions on the false chain effectively disappear. this is why it's important to run and use a full node
@_date: 2018-08-21 17:16:33
there are many articles you can read but here is a summary. bitcoin's most important feature is decentralization. to preserve this, running a full node must be easy to do. bigger blocks raise the cost of running a full node and open up attack vectors on the network. to achieve a transaction throughput that can handle global adoption, we need to find ways to more efficiently use the space in a block. this is not to say the block size will never be raised

a system using a credit card would most likely require the consumer to buy a minimum amount of credits, let's say $5. they would be hesitant to do so because $5 is a much larger number than 10 cents and consumers who want access to content from a site they don't frequent very often might take a long time to spend all of that $5 and might even forget about it. additionally, the content creator would have to pay the transaction fee for that $5 even though the consumer might not ever spend all of the $5 at their site. off chain transactions solve the issue of micropayments, period.

@_date: 2018-08-17 19:45:34
use one or more block explorers to check the transaction. but note that the chance of this kind of attack happening is quite low as any hashing power diverted into maintaining a false chain is wasted money. therefore, the potential profit from attempting a malicious attack would have to exceed the potential profits from honest mining. this is the risk and incentive structure of bitcoin at work. it's more likely to happen due to a concerted attack, such as the failed segwit2x fork

imo a really important note here. Bitcoin may not be perfect and may very well be replaced in the future by another cryptocurrency but as long as it is better than the legacy system, then it will win out. it's the same thing with robots and machines taking over jobs; they make mistakes but are still more efficient and cost effective than humans so they will continue to be used. but just as with robots and machines, bitcoin will only get better over time

a cold wallet is a wallet stored in a medium that is not connected to the internet. exchanges store the bulk of their btc in cold wallets so hackers cannot access them
an exchange will have multiple hot wallets (wallets that are connected to the internet) that typically only have enough btc to process all the btc transactions they expect in a certain time frame, like a day. think of fractional reserve banking but in this case we hope the exchanges are not insolvent (and using the blockchain, we can at least audit the bitcoin reserves of most exchanges)
I'm not a computer expert but I believe the hacker simply obtained a private key to one of their hot wallets somehow. the reason btc is trickling out over the 8 hours is because the hack went unreported/unnoticed and as people kept depositing btc into their bitfinex account, some of which gets deposited into the compromised hot wallet, the hacker subsequently swept the wallet

centralized companies like coinbase and changetip, who base their business model on cryptocurrencies, are doing more for bitcoin than anyone else. bitcoin was never meant to be a standalone system
@_date: 2019-07-31 03:53:00
desirable characteristics of a payment system:
1. fast and inexpensive to use
2. ability to transact electronically
3. censorship resistance (achieved through being decentralized)
cash: 1, 3
visa, paypal, etc: 1 and 2
altcoins: 1 and 2. 99.99% of altcoins are inherently centralized and will never be decentralized
bitcoin: 2, 3, **sometimes** 1. bitcoin is the only decentralized cryptocurrency and no other crypto can ever hope to match it. it is the only truly censorship-resistant, open, neutral and borderless payment system. unlike altcoins which can never hope to be decentralized, bitcoin **will** improve on its transaction throughput over time
do you see what is going on here? bitcoin has a unique set of properties that no other system has and no other system will **ever** have
before 2009, there were many attempts at cryptocurrencies. they all had fast and inexpensive payments but yet they all failed for one reason: they were centralized. bitcoin solved that
to think that the revolutionary aspect of cryptocurrencies is fast and inexpensive transactions indicates a serious shortcoming in one's understanding

a chain cannot increase its difficulty. an attacker would be mining against the same difficulty that the other chain is mining at. with less than &gt;50% of hashing power, an attacker has a very low chance to produce blocks faster than the true chain. in practice, a 51% attack is very unlikely due to the game theory of mining and continued decentralization of mining

because of the nature of markets, the number of people who make net gains from trying to time the market will **always** be less than the number of people who make net losses from trying to time the market. thus, the average person always has a better chance of making more long-term gains by simply hodling
@_date: 2019-08-12 03:19:10
in the event of such an attack, the devs could modify the pow algorithm, effectively rendering the attacker's hardware worthless. then there would probably be a rollback to undo any fraudulent blocks mined by the attacker. sure, bitcoin's reputation would take a hit but it would continue nevertheless
any attacker attempting an attack like this would have to realize that the money being spent on the hardware is basically a sunk cost and there is not even a guarantee they would be able to permanently destroy the bitcoin network, as it's simply just software

each block contains a hash of the previous block. when a miner creates a new block, they build on the currently longest chain (determined by the cumulative amount of work, not by the sheer number of blocks). if you were to fork off, you would need more hashing power than the rest of the network combined (&gt;50%) to guarantee that your chain remains the longest by outworking all of the other miners


when you mine, you hash the block header, which doesn't include transactions at all. it's mathematically infeasible to get the same hash over and over again

~~that's not how it works. if you created your own chain, you would only have your own hashing power behind it. the other chain still has the rest of the network's hashing power, meaning it will continue accumulating proof-of-work faster than yours (ie it would have "more hashes")~~
edit: I see now this example was in the context of a 51% attack, so ignore the above
the network chooses the longest chain. note that in 2017, bcashers were trying to make the argument that since bcash had more blocks (because their difficulty retargeting algorithm was modified in a stupid way), their chain was the "true" bitcoin chain. but this is not the case because bcash was a hard fork and thus had different consensus rules than bitcoin
in the case of a 51% attack, the chain being built by the attacker could potentially become the new bitcoin
in the case of a hard fork, the forked chain could potentially become the new bitcoin if &gt;95% of full nodes and miners follow it. if the community ever decides to do a hard fork, this is what would happen

in the meantime, we should focus on building bitcoin and making sure that it always exists to serve the people, as an alternative to fiat. ironically, doing so will give bitcoin more utility, which makes it more attractive to wall st

ibm is the corporate leader in misunderstanding blockchain. it's baffling that they've been involved in blockchain for this long and still haven't realized they've got it all wrong. as a result, it's no surprise that their reps are misguided, they've been fed misinformation for years


Blockchain is a shared, immutable ledger for recording the history of transactions. It fosters a new generation of transactional applications that establish trust, accountability and transparency—from contracts to deeds to payments.
shared? how is any ibm-controlled blockchain shared? can I run my own node on it without getting permission? do I get a say in how it's developed and maintained if I don't work there?
immutable? blockchains aren't magically immutable. **they are immutable only if they are decentralized**
blockchains establish trust, accountability and transparency? true, but only between peers. bitcoin was designed in such a way that its users don't have to trust corporations and individuals who are only interested in profit
it's no surprise that despite all their efforts, ibm hasn't produced a single viable blockchain-related product or service

why are you buying bitcoin? because you see a bunch of other people making money and want in on the action? that's called fear of missing out and it's stupid (even if you end up making money, it's still stupid)
if you're buying bitcoin because you've learned about it and understand its implications, then you've potentially made a good decision. only time will tell

no, it's not. running a full node is largely a selfish act. it allows you to verify transactions without trusting anyone else. this is **literally** the whole point of bitcoin

you are spot on. a centralized blockchain is completely pointless. in fact, before 2009, there already existed many concepts similar to blockchains, eg linked lists. therefore, it's not blockchain in particular that is the revolutionary feature of bitcoin. the truly innovative part is that bitcoin implements blockchain in a decentralized manner
a centralized blockchain is completely pointless

but the value of 0.00025 usd is easier to understand. we know that it is 0.00025 out of 1 whole dollar as opposed to 0.00025 bitcoins, which is difficult to calculate the value in terms of usd because it is 0.00025 out of 245 (which obviously changes all the time)

because if you sell your shitcoins, you get an iou from the exchange "promising" you your bitcoins. hypothetically, these ious can be greater than the total amount of bitcoin. you don't get the actual bitcoin until you withdraw it to an address where you, and only you, control the private key

I was using an analogy to make a point. the point is: no one should have that much power because given the chance, they *will* abuse it. we can't trust "big business" to make decisions on how bitcoin operates, so it should never even get to that point. if it does, bitcoin will have failed

they were two entirely different events
dao = eth foundation was invested in it, they had a lot to lose including their money and reputation. a large amount of eth ended up in the hands of a single entity who could crash the price. decision: modify their immutable blockchain
parity = members of eth foundation not affected. an even greater amount of eth rendered permanently inaccessible, causing a shortage in supply; this is *good* for the price. decision: tough luck plebs, choose a better wallet next time
eth is centralized. any cryptocurrency that is centralized is pointless and will not last

charlie understands the real value proposition behind bitcoin: decentralization. it's not a coincidence that almost every cryptocurrency supporter that's been around as long as charlie, still recognizes bitcoin as the coin with the most potential. it's not just because of "first mover advantage"
he created litecoin mostly as an experiment to see if a cryptocurrency would work if it sacrificed some decentralization for faster blocks. he never expected it to get as big as it is now
if you are surprised by what charlie is saying, you should do some more research

I remember reading that the quote in the genesis block is from the paper edition of whatever english newspaper it was and that the headline for the same story on their website is slightly different. so he likely had a hard copy and thus was living in england at the time. all the evidence points to him being english, however, just like everything else about him, none of the evidence is definitive

are you new to the internet? I'm genuinely curious. when people say "lolz" at the end of a statement, it's typically in a sardonic manner. eg "if trump wins, I'm moving to canada lolz" or "even after losing 30 lbs, he's still a fatass lolz" 
saying "Bitcoin now more stable than the pound. Lolz" is not supportive of bitcoin

bitcoin is simply an amalgamation of many existing technologies. what was revolutionary about bitcoin was that it managed to operate without a central authority entity, ie it was decentralized. that's it. that is the only innovative feature of bitcoin. therefore, any other cryptocurrency that is not decentralized is **completely** pointless
