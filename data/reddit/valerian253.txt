But what is the "content"? That's the heart of the question. Is the content the code presenting the page, or is the content only the words of an article? Am I, the user, mandated to accept malware/trackers/advertising that comes embedded in the code of a page presenting an article? I think this question has largely gone unanswered in the online world. The closest comparison I can think of is the Tivo/DVR commercial skip feature in television. Ultimately, the technology doesn't go away and publishers better brace themselves for that.

Bitcoin's dirty little secret is that all the wallets function completely differently. More precisely, they generate wallet addresses differently. Electrum is different from Airbitz is different from Mycelium is different from Breadwallet. Having to support all of them is just not realistic for a startup.
 
Re: using a single address… It's a really bad security practice. Letting everyone know exactly how much each video has earned is not something we want to do by default.

You only need to have an account to publish videos. **Viewers can use any bitcoin wallet** and do not need to sign up for anything. Providing a single address for all payments is the easiest way to track your earnings and is not safe. For security purposes, this is why we do not allow it.

We look at it a little differently. Here's a quote from the post:
 


 
What do you think?
@_date: 2016-04-28 17:28:40
There are a bunch of reasons. The main one is that a single xpub can generate completely different addresses based on how it is interpreted. For example, a single xpub will generate entirely different addresses on Mycelium Android versus Breadwallet iOS. If a user messes up that setup (…and, yes, users do make mistakes) then their funds don't show up in their wallet. Not a good look.
@_date: 2016-04-20 00:47:45
Have you seen Peer5? ( It's a hybrid P2P CDN that relies on WebRTC. My sense is, ultimately, we'll need a multi-layered approach to smartly figure out which method works best across a range of situations.

@_date: 2016-04-28 16:43:21
Let's be clear… WMB uses a third party to hold your funds. They are custodians of your money. They release your funds to you after holding for a day. If you didn't know this, now you do. In contrast, PopChest never holds your funds.

Absolutely! This place is our go-to ;)
@_date: 2016-04-19 16:59:35
We're starting with the payment element and working backwards from there. As we integrate bitcoin micropayment channels, transactions can happen in a truly trust-less fashion. Eventually, storing and serving the files can happen with something like Storj, IPFS, or Alexandria. Each element of the media distribution stack can be broken out so that no one element can be controlled by a single party. This is the first of many, many steps.
@_date: 2016-04-19 22:42:18
As you might imagine, I **love** Brave. I'm the local Brave meetup organizer in Los Angeles! I am closely watching the details of how Brave is implementing bi-directional micropayments. IMHO, Brave might be one of the biggest positives for bitcoin in quite some time.
@_date: 2016-04-28 15:55:36
Coinbase is only the receiving end that serves up payment addresses. **Viewers can use any bitcoin wallet**, without needing to signup for an account. As such, transactions are on-chain (…unless the viewer is using a Coinbase account also, then everything is off-chain). Make sense?
@_date: 2016-04-28 19:27:05

They would have to. If they just popped in an xpub and we interpreted it as Mycelium but the xpub came from Breadwallet, then funds would not show up in the user's wallet.

Yes! TheProtocol.TV started it all. I started making bitcoin related videos and I thought, "Rather than slapping ads all over this, wouldn't it be cool if we could use bitcoin micropayments instead?" That's how the idea of PopChest was born. Since then, we've been focusing on making the technology easy enough for non-bitcoiners to use.

@_date: 2016-04-28 16:21:22
I understand. And to do that, you would need an HD wallet which would change accounts for every video. This is why we started building PopChest based on Mycelium and Hive. For the reasons listed in my main comment, those options no longer work.
 
Even if we started using Gear as our backend today, the first thing we'd have to say to publishers is "Download this Android app, install it, export your XPUB…". One, that's super confusing. Two, we would limit publishers to *only those that have Android*…not iOS, not those without a smartphone. Isn't that suicidal for a startup?
 
When we have enough resources, we will devote them to building our wallet from scratch. Until then, we're focusing on our users first.
@_date: 2016-04-19 22:45:17
Excellent! I heard of the project but never saw this blogpost. Thanks for pointing it out :)
@_date: 2016-04-08 13:14:07
@_date: 2016-04-28 17:02:35
Bob, look at it with a longer time horizon. As we evolve, Coinbase will just be one of many options. For example, Airbitz just released its SDK. It will take time, but wouldn't that be a great addition to the publisher wallet options? You can't expect a startup to be everything from day one. It's like walking into Alexander Graham Bell's workshop and saying, "Meh. It's not an iPhone." Thanks for your patience.
@_date: 2016-04-28 15:34:54
Ok. Let's clear a few things up…
 
1) Viewers can use any wallet to watch any video without needing to sign up for an account. We neither limit your selection, nor track your viewing. Your payments go directly to publishers in real-time. IMHO, that's pretty f cool and something you can only do with bitcoin.
 
2) **For now**, publishers use a Coinbase wallet to receive payments. IT HAS NOT ALWAYS BEEN LIKE THIS. In fact, PopChest was originally built on top of the open source Mycelium and Hive web wallets. Then, Hive stopped being developed and ultimately went away. And, there was so much confusion from our users about Mycelium having totally different versions of Android and iOS wallets that we could no longer support it. So, rather than continue to play "bitcoin wallet bingo" we decided to go with the most stable development platform available, Coinbase. We're trying to challenge the 94-year-old advertising supported model of media using bitcoin and that's what we *need* to focus on. Count the number of companies that have disappeared into the "blockchain, not bitcoin" world over the last year. PopChest is still here and getting stronger.
 
As we roll out bitcoin micropayment channels to PopChest in the coming months all of this will become less of an issue. But, realize, this is a product made for real humans to use right now, not in the abstract. Our publishers are artists, not techies. The  question they ask of us is, "Great, I have bitcoin. Now how do I get money?" Point being, most exchange for fiat. It is their choice. If we start taking away people's choice because we don't believe it's the right thing then we've just replaced the old boss with the new. I think we can and should do much, much better.
 
I hope this helps. At the very least, [enjoy these **NSFW** videos]( that live on PopChest. Censorship is not happening. Cheers!
 
@_date: 2016-04-19 22:38:55
Viewers can use any wallet. This is only for publishers…for now. We originally built our service on top of the open-source wallet from Hive. Then that stopped being supported :(

I believe the hope is that the contest-winning video goes viral and gets spread to people who are not already deeply ingrained into the Bitcoin community. I put URLs underneath each person as an avenue for the interested to further educate themselves about all the aspects of Bitcoin…BitPay, Dark Wallet, Sean's Outpost…
Regardless of what element each pioneer is involved with, I wanted to show that what they all bring is an unwavering devotion to their purpose…just like the people in the original "Think Different" ad.
@_date: 2014-03-12 19:52:36
Hello. Thanks for your interest. I appreciate your very thoughtful question. Let me explain the project this way…  
If you take a handful of dirt and put it into a teacup full of water, then you will create mud. Right now, that is how the media's relationship with Bitcoin functions. Because the amount of people that understand Bitcoin is relatively small (like the teacup), it is easy for a handful of dirt (like what the media reports) to create a big mess (fear, uncertainty, doubt).  
But, if you take that same handful of dirt and dump it into the ocean, then there is not much of an impact. We want to use the persuasive power of television to create a larger body of people that truly understand Bitcoin. So, when the media tries to spread more dirt, it won't have much of an impact because now we will have an ocean of informed people around the world that can see through their crap.   
We don't want to replace one echo chamber with another. We want to help build more self-sufficient human beings that are capable of thinking for themselves. But, we have to arm those people with knowledge. And, I think we can all agree, the amount of easily understood visual knowledge about this technology is sorely lacking.  
This is an attempt to change that…on a MASSIVE scale.

One of the problems holding back projects like Coinpunk is the lack of legal guidance on equity crowdfunding. As the law in the U.S. stands right now, it is illegal for Coinpunk to publicly solicit equity investment from "non-accredited investors." All they can do is offer "reward-based" or "donation-based" participation. Hopefully, once the SEC clarifies the rules surrounding crowdfunding and the JOBS Act, there will be some more movement. But, right now, the upstarts are at a funding disadvantage.

I won't harp on all the other misconceptions that have been addressed in this post. But I do want to add:
1) Mycelium has the best BIP38 implementation, hands down. Right now, there is no better workable security for cold storage. Read up on BIP38 and you will sleep much better at night.
2) re: PDF backup… You can also share via Bluetooth to a local computer that is not connected to the internet.
In the future, if you have questions (even if you think they're stupid) just ask for help. I think you'll find the community around Bitcoin is very generous and encouraging. But, when you start spreading FUD around one of the highlight products out there, you just come across as, well, I'll leave it at that.
EDIT: If there is anything I would like to see added to Mycelium it would be the ability to choose your own password for encrypting the backup. Some may say that a random password is "better," but I believe users should be able to make their own choice.

I agree that it's no slam dunk. But, as with any dataset, it's possible to pick information that suits your particular viewpoint. For example: here's a comparison chart between USD-Argentine Peso vs USD-Bitcoin exactly one year from the date of your post: 
 
In that case, Bitcoin is up 362% whereas the Peso is down 33%.
I don't think anyone is saying Bitcoin is a cure-all. But, for the first time in history, there has proven to be a viable alternative to fiat and all the pitfalls that come with it. Whether it works or not in the end, who knows?

When you generate with BIP38, you get a public key and an encrypted private key. That encrypted private key can only be decrypted with your passphrase.  Why is this helpful…  
Let's say you print out a paper wallet WITHOUT BIP38. Yes, you have the security of not having your private key exposed to a computer connected to the internet, and by extension to malicious intent. But, if someone physically finds or confiscates your paper wallet, then you are most likely screwed out of those funds.  
Now, if you create a paper wallet WITH BIP38 then someone would have to physically possess the encrypted private key AND know your passphrase before being able to decrypt the private key and access those funds.  
Make sense?  
I use the Mycelium Android wallet which, when I scan the encrypted private key, will ask me for the passphrase before allowing me to move funds from an address.

I'm not sure if you understand that these are links to 8 different and entirely unique videos…produced by an entirely different camera crew. Or, do you?
I want the 8-part video series to present a choice for an individual to find subject matter than is specifically interesting to them.
Another way to think of it is like this: When you get a cookbook, do you read the whole book or do you go to the recipe that you find appealing? Sure, some people will read an entire cookbook if they like that particular chef. But, many people will go straight to the thing that makes their mouth water.
If you want to watch an entire 90-minute presentation all at once, then you should be free to do that. But, I would appreciate having the choice to learn/watch/experience at my own personal pace…
…which I believe my video series allows.  Thanks for reading.

I don't agree with that.  
You're assigning a value judgment to an individual bitcoin, which IMHO, is immaterial. Think of it this way…  I am an American. If we are perfectly honest, we can assert that the foundation of my country was built upon by slavery. My moral compass tells me that slavery is wrong. But…  
I don't conclude that I should give up being American. And I'm certainly not going to give away all of the advantages I perceive I get by being in the United States. However, what I will do is use those benefits to help myself and the world around me. I think the same applies to bitcoin. How an individual bitcoin gets to you is out of your control. And, no one will ever force you to use it. But, you are here. This is happening.  
Get in and take ownership of the situation or step aside and have the situation dictated to you.

It's a question of balance. The longer you make something &gt;&gt; the longer it takes to make &gt;&gt; the longer it takes to put out. This was shot in July, had its first screening in August at Cryptolina, was released on our website in September, and is freely available on YouTube in October.
 
The bitcoin universe changes so quickly that taking an abundance of time to release a project creates its own set of pitfalls that I would rather avoid.

Hello. What we are initially trying to accomplish is to visualize "an international Bitcoin hotspot and create a self-contained sample that clearly shows the potential of the larger project. We’ll follow one subject and bring to life an untold story from deep within the Bitcoin universe." To simply call this a "promotional video" misses the point. This is material that must meet the standards of international television broadcasting because, ultimately, we want to include it in the final television series.  
It might also help you comprehend the scale of this endeavor if I offer an example of what we're trying to accomplish…  
Let's say we want to go in-depth on what is happening in Cyprus. To tell the story of Cyprus today, that means you must tell the story of the 2013 bail-in. How many perspectives are needed to tell just that element of the story? The responsible thing to do would be to talk to quite a few people, on camera. So, let's say you have two camera crews…one camera person, one sound person, one producer…times two equals six people.  
How long would it take to get the full story? Well, let's say you want to talk to 20 people. If you spend an hour with each person, travel to meet the next person, and assuming you speak to them all during normal business hours, that is two days already. Let's say you want to understand what is happening today with NeoBee. I would imagine you'd want to spend a few days there, right? O.k., so we're already at a week. Your crew will need to eat and sleep, right? They will probably need gear too…some to rent, some to buy. Things will get lost or broken and have to be replaced. And, unless you can find an entirely local crew with international experience, you're probably flying people in and paying them according to their capabilities.  
And, then, you have to be prepared for all the things you can't prepare for. Anyone who has ever produced anything at this scale will tell you one thing for certain: SH HAPPENS!  
We haven't even started talking about the editing yet. So, as you can clearly see, when we talk about this kind of production our budget is hardly "insane." In fact, I fully expect to lose money. But, my hope is that what we as a community will gain from seeing a previously unseen possibility will be well worth the effort.
@_date: 2014-02-11 22:49:09
FWIW, I had two pending transactions that originally started around 10:30pm PST (~16 hours ago). One of them has disappeared from the transaction list and my account balance has been credited.
Also, while the transactions were still pending, I checked their details within Coinbase. Nothing ever had blockchain confirmation. So, I guess they either never left Coinbase or were refused acknowledgement from the blockchain.
@_date: 2014-08-18 18:25:58
As someone who's had films in festivals before and as an award-winning documentary filmmaker, I totally understand the frustration the "Rise" guys must be feeling. I'm absolutely certain they would like nothing more than to get their film in front of as many people as possible as quickly as possible. Unfortunately, once you turn over the product to distributors/lawyers/agents you immediately lose a great amount of control. That's just the reality of the business.
I've definitely learned from watching that unfold and will ensure our turnaround is cut from years/months down to a matter of weeks. This film was shot in the first week of July. It had its first screening at Cryptolina six weeks later. Things change so fast in the bitcoin universe that sitting on the product doesn't really do anyone any good.
Your tip is helping us move forward :-)

The great thing about the free market is that there is nothing stopping you from doing exactly what you suggest. So good luck! Keep us updated every step of the way.  
If you are interested in seeing some of the things that I have ALREADY CREATED for the Bitcoin community -- for free -- then you might want to check out:  
• the Andreas M. Antonopoulos presentation -   
• the "Think Different About Bitcoin" campaign -   
• "Show and Tell" at the Los Angeles Bitcoin Meetup -   
…but clearly you didn't read through any of the website. If you had, you would have already seen those links.  
You would have also seen that we are trying to do something on a scale that hasn't been attempted. We want to put a team deep into one of the Bitcoin international hotspots -- Argentina? Cyprus? Iran? Ireland? Iceland? -- and create something worthy of any television broadcast around the world.  
The Japanese have a proverb: "The nail that sticks out gets hammered down." We're prepared to face the skeptics, head on. You aren't the first and won't be the last. At least I am putting my frustration with the media to work and actively trying to change the status quo.

All of the products above are essentially the same..."X" company offers "X" service BUT Apple simply does it better (…from Apple's perspective, at least).
Bitcoin is fundamentally different. THERE IS NO MIDDLEMAN TO COMPETE WITH. From Apple's point of view, they simply can't allow that IDEA to enter the mainstream. They know they can't compete, so they try to kill the idea at its infancy.
Soon enough, they'll probably start blurting out "terrorist! money laundering! drugs! porn!" to continue the FUDfest.

Thanks for taking the time to check it out. User feedback is the most important currency for us right now :-)
 
Here's the thing about adblockers. Everyone is in the honeymoon phase right now. But they don't exist to make your life easier. They exist to be a middleman for which ads you get served -- 
 
For now, adblockers are "free" but the story doesn't end like that. Ultimately, YOU are the product.
 
We are pioneering a system where users and content creators connect as directly as possible. Sure, the price may be relatively high but understand that it's early days and we're still trying to find our way. The next iteration of our technology will allow any content creator to upload their own material and charge whatever they want.
 
Stick with us. It'd be great to get your perspective as we grow!

This doesn't sound like it's going to end well:
"As someone who personally has some funds in MtGox I’d personally like to know how much they lost. Prior to their press release I’d assumed the amount must be small or internal controls would have caught it, instead of people reporting it to them on chat. The intensity and character of their response leaves me worried that my initial estimates might have been incorrect."

Hello there. I'm Valerian from  a site that allows bitcoin micropayments for video.
 
The limitations you describe are a reflection of the bitcoin infrastructure as it stands. Many popular wallets don't allow spending below a certain level. And, the ones that do, are generally off-chain transactions. So our platform could allow you to spend $0.005 for a video but, as it stands, would mandate that you and the content creator have the same same wallet that offers off-chain transactions.
 
To us, that limitation is a non-starter. So, for now, we simply raise the minimum.
 
In the future, bitcoin micropayment channels or the Lightning Network should solve these problems. Until then, we work the best we can with what we have.
 
If you want to see bitcoin micropayments in action check out  or

Hello. Valerian from PopChest here. Thanks for the feedback. We'll do our best to clarify in the next update.
 
Yes, for content creators, having a Coinbase wallet is required. Initially we built our service on completely open-source wallets Mycelium and Hive. However, there was a lot of confusion for our users because the Mycelium Android app and Mycelium iOS app functioned completely differently and were built by completely separate teams.
 
Also, when Hive suddenly disappeared, we were seriously concerned about the well-being of our users. There is no way a company should puts its supporters at risk like that.
 
So, we ported everything over to the biggest, safest, most consumer-friendly API out there: Coinbase.

re: no email signup… The way you describe is exactly how the first version of PopChest worked. Unfortunately, for noobs that created more problems than solved...especially when it came to recovering download errors and accessing their library of paid content.

@_date: 2016-09-20 23:15:11
Great questions…


Bitcoin payments go straight to the publisher. We never hold your bitcoin. We're still iterating on the fiat payment side, so there's no final answer on that just yet.


Publishers send us a small percentage for using the system…including video encoding, hosting, streaming, and payment processing.


The first iteration of PopChest was exactly this. However, we got so many requests to provide a receipt and backups of all paid videos that we started asking for an email so people can save what they've watched. Originally we had a reverse lookup so you could just input the address you paid to (…copy/paste from wallet) and retrieve the video so as to maintain anonymity. But that turned into a real CF. Asking people to copy/paste addresses is user experience death :(


We're going to try a few different options to see what sticks. In principle, the more we connect artists with viewers the better. One of the real limitations of other video platforms is they don't really allow direct contact…in essence, the audience belongs to the platform and not the content creator. I'd like to change that. However, those desires have to be balanced with viewers' right to privacy. Overall, it's a work in progress but I hope you can understand my intent.

@_date: 2016-09-20 18:01:08

Hey there! Valerian from PopChest here. Hopefully I can clear up some of the confusion...
 
1) Do you have to login to use the service? Yes. But here's the thing, we tried an "ID by bitcoin address" well over a year ago and it was a disaster. Regular people (...read non-HODLers) just aren't ready for it. So much support needed that it wasn't worth it. As a startup we only have so much time and resources. Anything that doesn't exponential add to growth while frustrating usability has to be put on the back burner. I'm sure we'll revisit this at some point...in fact, we HAVE to.
2) Not sure what you're referring to. Our bitcoin backend is Bcoin...the same as Purse.io.
In other news, PopChest is doing quite well and making progress penetrating top tier video makers. Tonight, we're at The Streamys!

Eventually, people watching ads will be able to *earn* bitcoin micropayments in exchange for their attention. They could then use that to reward content creators rather than using advertising as an intermediary. It's all about giving viewers choice :)
@_date: 2016-05-12 19:43:05
Right now, it's totally ad-free through micropayments. As we evolve, we'll give viewers a bitcoin credit if they choose to watch ads. Win-win for everyone!

It creeps me out that my movements are tracked everywhere I go just because I have my phone by my side. I've started to use this regularly.

Good question…it doesn't. [PopChest]( operates as bitcoin micropayment-powered video right now without P2P video delivery. We (I'm the founder &amp; CEO of PopChest) could continue like that and be just fine. But…
 
Let's dream a little and start to imagine what a fully P2P system actually looks like. We're starting to see bits and pieces sprout up. Hopefully this article starts a healthy dialogue about what the total ecosystem looks like down the line.
@_date: 2015-10-09 21:41:31
You get my upvote for having the courage to ask a valid question :-)
 
We're definitely targeting the on-demand element. So for us, guaranteed delivery is paramount...regardless if that takes place on a p2p network or not. Not sure how Alexandria (or Mycelia) takes care of that. But I love the ambition of both projects. The more people banging in the same direction will only lead to more discovery :-)

TL;DR - PopChest, the bitcoin micropayments platform for video, is introducing how blockchain technology can reshape digital distribution for Hollywood.

You can try WatchMyBit. Their payments aren't real-time like PopChest and they hold your bitcoin for at least a day. But as you noted, it's not Coinbase. Enjoy!

With all due respect, Messrs Perklin, Pouliot, and Fenton, you are implying there was a limited time between the announcement of the election and the election itself. You seem to infer this minimal time period is the cause of the current voting confusion. This is a grossly misleading impression that you are spreading.
 
There were approximately **TWO MONTHS** between the official election announcement and the end of the voting period. 
 
Furthermore, it has been known **SINCE OCTOBER 2014** that an election would be held to fill the seat vacated by Mr. Matonis. 
 
On top of that, the seat being vacated by Mr. Andresen was clearly on the election agenda **SINCE APRIL 2014**. That's almost a full year ago. 
 
Finally, the actual voting procedure is **CLEARLY DEFINED** in the Bitcoin Foundation's Bylaws. 


 
My hope for Bitcoin is that it helps usher in a wave of personal responsibility…in finance, privacy, and more. For a prospective board member to not know the parameters for his own election is unsettling. And, for members who choose not to inform themselves of the voting process, I would suggest you make more time to participate rather than expect someone else to sort out your problems for you.

Yes. One of the (many) bizarre stories in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-02-15 19:02:24
Mr. Fenton,
 
Not only are you showing yourself to be vulgar, but you are also highlighting your complete lack of knowledge about this election. Disband.it sent out an email two weeks ago that clearly outlines the election process:
 
1. Here is the original email I received from Disband Foundation (disband.it) -- 
 
2. Here is the web version of that same email -- 
 
Maybe it's time to put down the keyboard. This is not turning towards healthy discourse.
 
FWIW, here's the text of the Disband.it email sent on Feb. 2:
 
I would like to invite you to a celebration.
 
On February 13, and for four days thereafter, the ailing Bitcoin Foundation will ask its members to elect two representatives to its board of directors.
 
You and I know this directorate has always been a roster of derelicts and statist collaborators; professional apologists for the counterrevolution in Bitcoin, which was always this organization's unifying reason. So I have an offer.
 
My name is Cody Wilson. I will stand for election to the board of this Foundation to offer you, the digital libertarian, a genuine means of ending a public affront to your ideals.
 
Please read about my platform and thinking here. My specific call for the Foundation's dissolution has been endorsed by former board member Andreas M. Antonopoulos and current member Gavin Andresen.
 
 
If you are not a member and wish to disband it, the central committee demands that you join the Foundation for voting rights. The deadline to do this is February 6, which may be done here.
 
If you are already a member and wish to disband it, you must still notify the central committee that you are "active." To be known as an active member, the central committee would have you login here, click on the “Election” tab, and follow the on-screen instructions.
 
The deadline to do this is February 10.
 
How can I find out more about the election? 
The central committee will send you an email with access to the ballot at your confirmed email address.
 
The only other place they have offered information is here.
 
 
For its critical betrayals and collusion against the Bitcoin entrepreneur, this Foundation must be destroyed.
 
It suffers a slow and infamous death. On February 13, we will give it a quick and significant one.
 
I will send another email on election day.
@_date: 2015-02-15 02:11:39
If you'd like to ask me what I think rather than assume, here it is:
 
Candidates that do not know the rules of the organization they wish to govern should get no sympathy.
@_date: 2015-02-15 02:51:56
Are you saying you want special voting rules for existing board members, "prominent" members, and developers? Please explain what privilege they deserve above everyone else.
@_date: 2015-02-15 03:12:40


 
No, that's not what I think. This is an example of colossally apathetic participation when it comes to the Foundation. 
 
The only way to understand "the wishes of the voters" is to count the votes that are cast. Simple.
@_date: 2015-02-15 01:42:05


 
"…not allowed to vote"? That does not describe this situation at all. No one is preventing anyone from voting. Are you saying that you didn't receive any Foundation emails? Are the people you feel that are being excluding reporting they didn't receive emails either? Please explain.
 


 
Improvement  your emails from the Foundation. Improvement  you change your email, update your profile. I think that solves 99% of the problems at hand. Other than emailing the membership multiple times over the course of months, what other methods would you suggest to the Foundation?
 
Rather than take isolated numbers with no context, let's ask some broader questions:
 
Of that 80% that are now being "excluded", how many have read the entirety of every email sent from the Bitcoin Foundation? How many actively read the Foundation blog? How many have read the Bylaws? How many have participated in a voluntary committee in the past year? How many have engaged on GitHub or the forums?
 
My guess is that non-participation number is WELL MORE than 80% of the membership. If you want to ask why don't people more actively participate in the Foundation, then that's a fair question. But to make participation level into an election issue unnecessarily conflates the two. If it's an issue for you now, it should have been an issue for you BEFORE the election.
 
Final question, before running for a Director seat, did you fully read the Bylaws? If so, it seems that knowing the election system should not have been an issue.
@_date: 2015-02-15 17:12:40
Good morning, Jim.
 
Thanks for taking time to clarify your position. I see where our misunderstanding took place and will edit my original post accordingly.
 


 
I wholeheartedly agree.
 
FWIW, I received your multiple emails outlining the election process. In fact, I also got emails from Cody Wilson's group Disband.it which was well ahead of this. So, clearly, some candidates knew exactly what the process was all along. Others did not.
 
Since last night, I listened to the LTB candidate debate. Your comment that ~"participation level would be very telling" is turning out to be eerily omniscient.
 
Best of luck to you. And, regardless of the outcome of this election, I find it encouraging that a person of your caliber and experience is serving the cause of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-02-15 01:18:15


 
My interpretation of your statement above reads as though you feel this was a "snap election" that was sprung on members without warning. And, it's that lack of process which is playing itself out in election chaos today.
 
Is that an incorrect read? If so, please clarify.

Good Bye. For Now.
PopChest is shutting down immediately. But, we shall return!
 
There is some amazing news on the horizon, which I can't wait to share. Broadly, PopChest will be temporarily moving from Los Angeles to Silicon Valley and get some additional resources so we can pursue the idea of bitcoin micropayments for video with maximum intensity. The accelerator we'll be attending should give us a boost.
 
For now, the old site must die. I am really sorry for the inconvenience this will undoubtedly cause. When we relaunch, it will be bigger and better than ever before. If you have any thoughts, ideas, suggestions, or even criticisms I would LOVE to hear them. We want and need to get better if PopChest is to serve you to the best of our ability. Here is [a scheduling link]( to chat or email me directly: valerian
  
You have given me an amazing ride. But, our journey has just begun.

I just saw the latest episode and I think is starting to "get it."
One thing about Bitcoin that I would hope you'd highlight is this:  "Instantaneous, worldwide, transfer of VALUE at little to no cost without any 3rd party intermediary."
Imagine in 1985 if I told you that you could have "instantaneous, worldwide, transfer of KNOWLEDGE at little to no cost without any 3rd party intermediary."  You would probably have thought I was on drugs.  Who would ever need such a thing?!  Fast forward 15 years to 2000 and the world couldn't exist without the internet as we know it.
Now extrapolate "instantaneous, worldwide, transfer of VALUE at little to no cost without any 3rd party intermediary" out to 2030 and you start to see just the edge of what is possible.
Enjoy the ride.
