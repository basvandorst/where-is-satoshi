Yeah I think there's a reason the "hold" meme is pushed so hard. I think if you saw some wallets, the people saying HODL the loudest would be dumping after their pump right about now.

You make it sounds as if bitcoin is a commodity in a bubble, not a currency used for the exchage of goods and services.

Pretty shitty that mods think how long you've been a redditor relates to how sound your statements are. The mods are making an appeal to authority.

Wait, so you have to wait 5 days for a transaction to clear?

Those are all investment vehicles. So why do people keep talking about using bitcoin to buy things? And if you can't buy things with it, what does it do? It doesn't give you dividends or voting rights, you can't live in it, it's not used in electronics, and I can't buy Darth Vader with it. Let's concede then that bitcoin is not a currency. It's an investment vehicle, and one that only has value for current holders, and only if new people keep buying in so that current holders can sell out. Once people see that the only way to get value out of bitcoin is to sell it... well, then a lot of people lose a lot of money.

I can use btc in my home town for fewer goods and services than I could 4 years ago.

No offense, but I think you'really missing his point.
Im not sure of the technical terms, but A 401k is an investment instrument, not a currency. And trying to time the market on your investments is pretty risky.

There's a reason this sub is begging you to hold.
