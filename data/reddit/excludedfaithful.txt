Bitcoin will never be federally regulated! Hell yes. Isn't that what we wanted? This will cause previous nervous buyers to jump in knowing that the promise of Bitcoin will always be true. Fuck the SEC! lol jk

Absolutely. Bitcoin proved today that it can be trusted. Who wants bitcoin that wants federal regulations on their Bitcoin. Good way to weed the stupid people Out anyway.

I'm not saying I didn't almost throw up for a second.  I was terrified it would pass.  ;)

Sometimes people get emotional attachments to objects. You may want to talk to someone that can help.

My mom also laughed. She's 80. But she also gave me 500 to invest for her last Christmas. She did not want to be told anything about it until this Christmas. I'm Getting a little tear just thinking about the big reveal. 
Edit:  Thanks everyone.   Bitcoin has been a life changer for our family. No, we did not sell anything or refinance the house. I learned about Bitcoin simply by hearing it mentioned in a movie and was like "What the hell is that ?"   I'm smart enough to know that there are smarter, amazing people out there who are doing amazing things. And I wanted to be a part of that.     Bitcoin has meant both freedom and unity to me. Freedom that my currency can truly be mine and unity because I know I am part of something special shared all around the world!   
Thank you all for these awesome comments.

Here we go $20,000.
It has never been easy.  Accept the climb.  Try to be happy?

Recover?  Recover from what?  
@_date: 2017-05-05 17:52:46
@_date: 2017-05-09 11:52:03
Yes. If anyone else feels the  need to rid themselves of all that heavy Bitcoin, there are a few brave that are willing to accept. 
@_date: 2017-05-04 19:00:56
Ball up and buy now. You realize you are going to be saying that forever, right?  
@_date: 2017-05-05 17:36:46
I don't think they are looking for pointers about what they could have/should have/wish they really had. 
Ug. That's really annoying. 
@_date: 2017-05-05 17:38:28
I bet you irritate most people you come into contact with.
