I bought 152 (one hundred and fifty two), sold 10 right off the bat and to buy darkcoin, and eventually sold it all.

Yes, but you can buy. Is this a good exchange? I mean, all I'm concerned about is she doesn't get ripped off. She went to some cafe yesterday and a bunch of guys wanted her to go get cash...sounded shady. Obviously, I told her not to go get cash and to go through an exchange.

I said from the start (and still say) it'll go to the million. But of course I was just guessing...

I agree. I just get asked about daily (from people who told me I was crazy to buy into from the start) and it's getting to me. Well it's getting to me today anyway, because my best friend, who's a really good investor and just so happens to be the person I listened to the most when I made the decision to sell, just asked if I still had my coins this morning:-(
anyway, onto my next mistake...

Don't know what to say. I guess I got balls of sand.

That's what I tell myself. I never would have been able to hold on to them. At some point, 2k, 5k, 10k...I would have bailed. The funny thing is, when I bought it I was a hard core libertarian and my plan was to never sell them no matter what.

Will do man, thanks again.

In Canada they're selling for 22k (give or take)* 152 coins = 3,344,000

I don't know  you, but it helps to just hear someone I don't know say something that cheers me up a bit. Thanks for that:-)

152. Paid $35 each:-(
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:57:47
She's in Vancouver, me in mtl:-(

Man...that really sucks. I never would have been able to hold on until today's price either.
