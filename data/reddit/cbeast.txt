I have to go with all good. Bitcoin needs to be competitive on all levels to remain healthy. The problem is that the devs are people who are influenced by politics. They think they have to manage Bitcoin rather than let the monster loose. The market needs to determine its best course. Unlimited blocks are the only way to go in the long run. Otherwise, the small market cap will eventually lead to a fork with an enormous marketing budget and a new algo. Of course, that is also all good because if that fork doesn't have an unlimited blocksize, then it will be forked by an even bigger budget and and yet another algo. It will continue until miners finally wise up and accept **unliblocks**. Small blocks only pay the shovel salesmen.

Some say Bitcoin's greatest feature is as an immutable time-stamp. This feature is important in proving authenticity for documents and virtual goods, both of which can serve as currencies. This is what folks are calling "The Blockchain" as it shows that the bitcoin tokens are not the only store of value within the Bitcoin ecosystem. This is important for security because it creates a means to prove chains of custody for such devices. Real value isn't just given away. 
While documents are part of the legal domain, virtual goods can be used to prove identities cryptographically that are also easily recognizable by humans. Electronic picture ID displays also serving as keys, passports, or credentials, for instance. Even legal documents can become virtual in the form of things like titles, deeds, and contracts if they are allowed to be electronically exchanged.
The virtual world including games, social media, and telecommunications can benefit from derivative tokens created by "The Blockchain" tokens as well. While they don't require such serious security as identity and keys, they would benefit from *theoretically slightly less* secure secondary tokens created from the primary tokens. They trade further functionality for trust, although there are algorithms that claim to minimize trust. Web page security tokens would benefit from "The Blockchain's" transparency especially if they can be verified independently by the services of your choice, or your own.

Concern trolling is a version of the [strawman fallacy]( where the position pretends to appeal to moral principles to add weight.

While payment channels can use short settlement times, LN uses long term windows. Larger settlements will most likely be managed with hub and spoke financial institutions rather than nested contracts because risk of early settlement is higher and hence more fees.

There can be no legally granted monopoly of Bitcoin. There will always be competition for processing fees. LN can't be monopolized either because there are many ways to accomplish it.

Firstly, you would have to have a balance on any chain that appended to your contract. Allowing that would invite thousands of sidechains to join in. Now we're back to the current system. You have no control as to whom joins your payment channel and shady sidechains will take fees and then de-peg their bitcoins while their sidechains crash leaving bagholder contracts closing and paying fees.

If it goes viral it will grow exponentially. Amounts will grow proportionally to adoption. Micropayments are a natural fit to begin the network, but it can grow beyond them because it's relative to the adoption.

How does this relate to miners and users? Please explain.
@_date: 2015-06-02 12:56:25
250 thousand people die every year from violent street drugs crimes which is a 321 billion dollar per year industry.  Sadly six poor souls were allegedly lost because of the fifty million dollar per year silk road website. While tragic, the same amount of traffic would have generated many times more deaths on the streets. Maybe it's time to address the disease and not just the symptoms.
@_date: 2015-06-15 16:32:18
BIP 100is a bell curve distribution and would be difficult to game. However, it also would hinder growth toward increased bandwidth because cheaper electricity would vote favoring higher fees. 
I may be way off base, but it seems that there is real conflict between cheap energy and good communications tech. Everyone has one or the other, but never both.
In order to balance them, a parameter to increase block reward time adjustment should go along with the block size.  So if 60% vote in favor of the 4MB block and 5 minute blocks, their vote for a 5 minute block might go with the 3MB block size. It may seem more complex, but the block size and difficulty go hand in hand. Miners with high speed would have more chances of getting a block even if their competitors have more hashing power because they have cheaper electricity. It might help increase decentralization.
@_date: 2015-06-20 09:51:25

There are economic reasons those datacenters have an advantage that makes them an "aristocracy." Take away that advantage and Bitcoin allows anyone to compete.

Nobody has come even close to creating a better technology after six years. You can still own a significant percentage of it. Every year it stays on top, it secures its place. Bitcoin doesn't have a marketing agency behind it so you have to learn about it on your own.
@_date: 2015-06-25 09:06:26
The blocksize limit was a temporary measure, not a rule and not part of the core protocol. It requires a soft fork only. The 1MB already gives an unfair advantage to Chinese miners with government subsidized energy. Miners with government subsidized bandwidth get no advantage with a small block size. Coincidentally, a small block size also limits Bitcoin's potential growth while a large block size expands Bitcoin's potential growth. It behooves us all to give the advantage to the miners with higher bandwidth so they can allow more people to use bitcoins without having to compete for higher fee payments.
@_date: 2015-06-09 05:10:07

Miners accepting fees will be able to afford more hashing power to drive the small block miners away. Filling blocks will be priced into miner budgets.

The math may be incorrect, but even if it was off by a couple orders of magnitude, it still makes the point.

Wishywashy adverbs like 'inherently' are sophomoric and meaningless here. Conditions that mitigate value are unavoidable. We use the term deflationary in the macroeconomic sense. There is no such thing as 'non- inherently' deflationary to describe a store of value. To call something inherently deflationary is superfluous.






Tautological. You are again saying something is because it is. I think you do not make your points very well.
Legal tender is not fiat status. Gold can be legal tender but is the antithesis of fiat as it can be melted down and changed to something of a different value hence the fiat value is meaningless. Fiat currencies are assigned values based on economic controls, not independent market forces. Bitcoin is like gold.
B^2 currencies like colored coin and mastercoin are designed to allow capital controls just like fiat currencies. That gives people a choice.

The energy savings against just the Bank of America energy use would probably be worth the carbon footprint.
Merge mining Namecoin may offer additional savings if it is adopted.
A single proof of stake coin would never become universally accepted, nor would it need to. Trust issues would prevent the efficiency savings over proof of work. Each sovereign would want their own for obvious reasons. Exchange servers would need to manage hundreds if not thousands of currencies. All the extra resources needed for proof of stake economies would end up dwarfing one global Bitcoin.

Centralization and anonymity do not go together. Collusion without accountability has always ended badly for entire groups of people. Unless the protocol can guarantee that no group will ever secretly acquire controlling stake, then   efficiency becomes desirable only to groups motivated by power. Large corporations use large and highly efficient accounting firms to cook their books and abscond with other people's money. A large stakeholder cabal could secretly form to nefarious ends. They could work great ills without discovery because we can never know when such a majority stakeholder exists. 
tl;dr Proof of Stake uses efficiency as an excuse for heinous immorality.

51% means there only becomes a possibility of risk of an attack. It's like sex, if you never have it, you won't die from pregnancy. If you do become pregnant, then you try to have a baby.

Ignoring politics is also doing politics. And any action you do (or technology you implement) will have political consequences - whether you like that or not.


So ignoring politics is political.  Then ignoring religion is being religious? Chastity is sex? Unemployment is work? Down is up? The current US Congress is political like an infant is responsible. There is no politics going on. Studying political science is not being political. Engaging in political debate is not being political any more that studying xenobiology is being an alien. 
My point is simple. Politics, like science, evolves with technology. In fact, future politics won't resemble anything we have today. There is a good chance that people will never even contact other people for anything someday. Political science will one day be as useful as astrology.

Addressing Transaction Malleability
MtGox has detected unusual activity on its Bitcoin wallets and performed investigations during the past weeks. This confirmed the presence of transactions which need to be examined more closely. 
Non-technical Explanation: 
A bug in the bitcoin software makes it possible for someone to use the Bitcoin network to alter transaction details to make it seem like a sending of bitcoins to a bitcoin wallet did not occur when in fact it did occur. Since the transaction appears as if it has not proceeded correctly, the bitcoins may be resent. MtGox is working with the Bitcoin core development team and others to mitigate this issue.
Technical Explanation:
Bitcoin transactions are subject to a design issue that has been largely ignored, while known to at least a part of the Bitcoin core developers and mentioned on the BitcoinTalk forums. This defect, known as "transaction malleability" makes it possible for a third party to alter the hash of any freshly issued transaction without invalidating the signature, hence resulting in a similar transaction under a different hash. Of course only one of the two transactions can be validated. However, if the party who altered the transaction is fast enough, for example with a direct connection to different mining pools, or has even a small amount of mining power, it can easily cause the transaction hash alteration to be committed to the blockchain.


Most wallet and exchange services will keep a record of this said hash in order to be able to respond to users should they inquire about their transaction. It is likely that these services will assume the transaction was not sent if it doesn't appear in the blockchain with the original hash and have currently no means to recognize the alternative transactions as theirs in an efficient way.












To put things in perspective, it's important to remember that Bitcoin is a very new technology and still very much in its early stages. What MtGox and the Bitcoin community have experienced in the past year has been an incredible and exciting challenge, and there is still much to do to further improve.

@_date: 2014-01-08 05:29:35
A double spend is sending money to someone and then reversing the transaction afterward. Denying a transaction is refusing to publish it in the blockchain. The former is possible with PoW, but very avoidable. The latter is only possible with PoS. I'm not a fan of PoS, but it can have some limited use for perhaps a Martian currency that has limited exchange capability with Bitcoin due to being beyond the PoW time restrictions.

Testnet coins were never released for markets. They have no value and little security and thus are not considered altcoins. There have been many forms of e-currency before Bitcoin with more security and value than testnet in its beginnings.

There was a discussion about developing an app that this seems to be attempting, called InstantBet on 
Essentially it would allow you to bet with someone anywhere, anytime using multisig transactions. It would be a more elegant way to accomplish what you are attempting. It would also be used to mitigate risk on real world transactions which is the origin of escrow services. I can see a usefulness in creating an xcp if you are running a private escrow service, but they would need to be tied to specific servers and the service bureau would be accountable for their service.
There are already escrow services available in a wide variety. This is a welcome addition and I will reserve judgement until there has been more review.

I understand the concerns. I am working with folks in Mindanao to set up the combination of private lending/BTC remittance/BTC exchange. Philippines has no special licensing for sole proprietor money exchanges. Pinoys are some of the most resourceful people. They understand security. Everyone I have educated about Bitcoin seems to grasp the basic concepts, even an older judge who advised caution, but saw no obstacles on small scale operations.
Selling bitcoins to investors is the only bottleneck. This will happen organically as the resourceful filipino entrepreneurs discover the virtues of international bankless finance.

Bureaucrats just naturally attack anything they don't understand. Didn't you see Ghost Busters? It's not a conspiracy.
No. The threat we are facing is one which has plagued societies for thousands of years: Schisms.
Try starting a community organization sometime. Just as soon as all the hard startup work is done, others come in and try to take over. This happens with neighborhood watch groups, churches, theater groups, and cryptocurrencies.
This is the beauty of open source. If someone wants to disrupt a happily working group, it's easy enough to just ignore them. Don't let them play marketdroid games. Don't invest in anything that advertises heavily before demonstrating worthiness. Learn to filter out the scammers.

Ethereum is too ambitious. It's a nice idea but so is world peace. I wish them luck, but I am done donating to projects that seem too good to be true.  Even Bitcoin Magazine failed to survive in the wild. I didn't get the issues I paid for and never saw it in bookstores. I'm waiting for colored coins, Trezor, and a host of other developments that will make Bitcoin better. Until there is some working proof of concept, I'll just call it a good idea but not a realistic project. I have my own project I'm working on here in the Philippines, but I will keep it to myself until I have something. I've had a lot of good ideas that failed in the marketplace, mostly because they were too ambitious or too far ahead of the market. I now have a pretty good sense now of what is realistic. I see a lot of folks stealing hard working people's thunder and I don't like it. If there is merit to Ethereum, then let's see it as an open source project. I'm still disappointed in Ripple for that point. There is too much hype out there. Bitcoin doesn't need any of it, though these projects would help. One thing is for sure, they all take years to develop. I don't expect to see anything like Ethereum for 4 - 8 years. Open Transactions will be done before then. Other technologies will create new markets as well. I doubt there will even be a need for Ethereum by then.

It is illegal for banks to use cryptocurrencies in most major nations like USA and China. With Bitcoin I can buy gold coins online I can put in my hand with no delay. With Ripple I can buy an IOU of gold that I can never put in my hand. I'll choose real gold. With a credit card I can buy gold and my purchase information will be sold to advertisers by the credit card processor. Ripple still can't be used to buy anything real like credit cards and Bitcoin can.
@_date: 2014-12-18 10:37:32
If you look at the exchange rate given by xoom, it is about 4% lower than standard rates. Add to that the $7.95 fee if you want to send the money quickly with a credit card. If you are sending under $800, you are paying about 5%. If you use Coinbase you'll pay 1% with a tight spread &lt;1% to buy bitcoins and the bitcoin exchange rates are usually pretty good. Then Rebit charges 1% and has also a tight exchange rate &lt;1%.
Now you may say that is pretty close and you would be right. But with Bitcoin you have the option of keeping a percentage without converting to fiat. Philippine ATMs are frequently offline (at least where I live) and Bitcoin is always there. What the Philippines needs is an Bitcoin ATM system that doesn't use bank networks. Then a remittance system would win just through sheer reliability.

You got it half right. But you can't make a secure PoW network instantly like you can with a PoS (at least as secure as they can be anyway).


I did not claim it gave it value. I said it backed it. Price is a much more complex function. I can tell you pretty much how much gold there is in the world, can you tell me how much it will be worth when x% additional gold supply is added in 10 years? I thought not.


Agreed. It will be for Bank of America, Citibank, and HSBC, and a thousand other financial institutions when they rollout their PoS payment networks. Your pathetic pet PoS will be long forgotten.


Meni posits an untested hypothesis. It doesn't contradict my hypothesis. Neither are exclusive. I never claimed miners "control" bitcoin, I claim they back bitcoin. I never said they were the only thing. Using my previous analogy, if a network executive creates a crappy show, then even if all of the stations carry it, it won't make people watch. They must be responsive to their customers. This is where Meni's hypothesis comes in play. They are synergistic.
If Meni were to say that a coin is exclusively controlled by the whims of the user base and subject to media influence, then I would disagree in it even being a protocol.

I think it is much worse than a mere scam. It is sanctimonious and insulting to open source projects. It claims to partner with Bitcoin, but in fact plans to have everything to replace it. Premined coins are anathema to the spirit of Bitcoin. Funding is the worse reason to issue them. It's usually best to go with your first instinct. I wish them well but I strongly warn folks that anything claimed too good to be true, probably is. I would prefer they start over as an open source project and take time to do it right.

Nobody would be foolish enough to sell bitcoins on mtgox. Anyone left with bitcoins will withdraw them. Anyone with fiat will take their chances in withdrawing it or perhaps mtgox themselves will sell bitcoins at a premium because of course they can withdraw their own personal cash without problems. I could be wrong but there's really no way to hold them accountable.

Decentralization is not just about network nodes, though the gateway model is questionable. It is also about incentives. When a single source controls your tokens, you are obliged to follow its edicts. That's why people are afraid that early bitcoin adopters will make demands and threaten the network with huge dumps. Ripple Labs holds 60% (maybe 90%) of the XRP. If I were negotiating a gateway deal and going through the regulatory process, I would be nervous about RL.

Many people don't know the difference between anonymity and privacy. Privacy is need to know. Anonymity is the perfect crime for kidnapping, assassination, extortion, and narcotics. Cash supports those crimes because it is anonymous. Bitcoin supports law enforcement by being traceable by law enforcement through subpoenas and security access. Identity theft is a lack of privacy. Bitcoin doesn't support a lack of privacy. Even if Bitcoin is traceable it doesn't mean it can be seized so you still have privacy of papers and finances no matter how traceable it is.

I've been thinking about this idea for two years. It would need to be a modular system as the protocol does not support such a large open ended system. Each module would be centralized on servers, but would be mirrored. These modules can create virtual credit unions, insurance pools, stocks, etc. 
They would be of fixed size as they would be highly complex. Really though we're talking about derivatives based on the bitcoin protocol similar to OT, colored coins, etc.

Unfairly giving yourself a permanent 51% stake through anonymous accounts allows you to have the appearance of a    but actually value fiat.


The onus of proof is the one selling the shitcoins. You claim it's a magical unicorn? Prove it. Bitcoin is designed so that even if the wealthiest people in the world buy all the coins and all the mining equipment, it can be antiquated by smarter people. PoS coins can be bought slowly and secretly through anonymous accounts until someone has permanent control. That kind of power is irresistible .
I'm not saying it's likely. It's more likely they will create and market their own and just distribute 51% to themselves through anonymous accounts. Can I prove it? Well derp.


I'm saying you can clone any of them for no cost and have equal security to the original. There's no network effect because there's no network. Marketing will make them succeed.


If I buy 51%, then attack, and then sell all my coins I'm out nothing. How tough is that? You can't do that with Bitcoin hardware because it will be depreciated.




My arguments are simple because they are obvious. I'm not saying that PoS coins aren't useful. Every Central Bank should have one.

Agreed. Bitcoin works fine as a currency, but because it can also serve as a reserve currency, institutional investors will aggregate them.

They may only be traded a few times in a lifetime if they are held for long term investments. That's what I like about Lightning. At least it uses bitcoins as the final settlement. It will be a long balancing act between bitcoins and colored coins.

Bitcoin is growing organically. Trust in the blockchain needs to be earned. The theory is solid and the devs working on it have clear vision and strategies.

Credit cards have not been around very long. They are only a few decades older than Bitcoin, which is not very long in money terms. Look how much trouble credit cards are in already. They are a failed experiment that Central Banks just keep pouring money into.
Before credit cards, people saved money. They used escrow and down-payments to secure contracts. There was a BBB. Local banks loaned money for homes and small businesses. People deposited their money in banks and were paid compound interest.
The old ways worked for hundreds of years. Credit cards broke our communities by putting the small banks out of business. They destroyed Main Street. Bitcoin will fix that. Bitcoin will give us secure internet transactions and allow us to save money for the future.

If Buterin didn't believe Bitcoin wasn't a useful currency, he wouldn't have used it for fundraising. If he thought a volatile currency wasn't useful, he wouldn't have created ether. He compares currency pairs of legacy fiat with an undeveloped derivatives market, which he claims to be building. 
He has a hard time talking without stuttering which tells me he isn't sure what he's talking about. Then he starts quoting some economists Keynesian drivel. He doesn't even mention that there is no stable market with any volume. He did mention price estimators, but has no clue how to make them so he smirked and dismissed them. Then he reinvents demurrage (called stablecoin), which which would cause even greater price instability. 
He came up with a clever version of smart contracts (which many others developed before him), but I am at a loss why it's any better than other Bitcoin 2.0 apps.
He doesn't have a developed moral compass as to how technology affects people. I presume it's simply the arrogance of youth.

No. Not useless. There was nothing in existence that could do what Bitcoin did. In fact it had exactly the same usefulness then as now, so you must think they are still useless.
Bitcoin isn't trade like baseball cards. The first transactions for pizza wan't because Mr pizza guy heard about Bitcoin and sought some, it's because someone sold him on how cool it was that it could send value like magic. 
Stores often buy container loads of stuff salesmen sell them, but because there is nothing special about them, they are ignored by consumers. This is what altcoins are.

I said "it's because someone **sold** him on how cool it was that it could send value", note I said 'send', not 'have'. Even Satoshi said "acquired any value at all for **whatever reason**" as the condition for value. Selling something is how most things go from Bob to Alice.
Words have meaning. Satoshi literally called it a Bit**coin** because coins have value. Literally all coins have value when they are first made. He was selling the idea that they have value from the time he penned the white paper. 
He could have just as easily called it Bittorrent Payment System. He could have worked out all the metadata methods for pegging value to secure tokens, but that would not incentivize miners. No, mining was all about making money by design.

Reusing addresses is a bad idea unless you are sending to a cold wallet, the hot wallet can be compromised. Also there is a technical issue in general cryptography about reusing the same codes because they can be broken if used enough over time. In Bitcoin, sending to a cold wallet ifs fine if it has never been used online. I foolishly reuse addresses, but only ones I control the keys for. With Bitstamp, they have the private keys.

You almost lost me in the first paragraph. Political debates are a nice idea, but go nowhere. Mostly you talk about technology and I would like you to stick with that theme. Fiat currency won over coin, because it was a technology. Fractional reserve banking and financialization are products of double entry accounting technology. Bitcoin will win over fiat for the same reason. Triple entry accounting, m of n, smart contracts, etc. will end financialization.

It's not a flaw, it's a powerful force for change. Like everything else it shouldn't be arbitrary. It should be asymptotic. Make the threshold low enough that obvious changes can happen fast even if there is a vocal minority. If that limit isn't met, then it automatically raises with a new time limit to allow further discussion. If say a limit of 60% is not met, then it will invoke serious discussion before a 65-70-75% limit approaches. 
I don't see the "spin-off" as being an altcoin, but another form of governance. While it intends to address distribution, Bitcoin's has already been skewered by Satoshi and the early miners themselves that failed to circulate those coins. We need to address the distribution screw up. That is the real Sword of Damocles over many investor's heads and what is holding back major investment.

It doesn't matter, if not core/Blockstream, it would be someone else. This model of governance is what Bitcoin was designed for. If you really think the idiots are running the show, then sell your coins and stop mining, and support the system you believe in. This isn't a two-party system enthralled by the military-industrial complex. Each individual has a voice and needs to follow what they feel is the best path. The devs with the pull rights need to follow their conscience and do what they feel is the best vision of an electronic cash system.
BitcoinXT was a huge success in showing the power of a few individuals unafraid of political ramifications. Mike martyred himself, but he is not gone and will probably be back.
The team members of Blockstream or anyone else for that matter, should be humble and feel privileged to be working on this project. They must also admit when they wrong or offer reasonable compromise when their vision is incompatible with an electronic cash system.
I suspect the drama will intensify in 2016 as larger interests begin to understand the value of Bitcoin.

Miners trust their pools. Pools are a social contract with the miners. Centralization is when that social construct becomes significant. The pools right now are pitifully small.

The term "on-chain" is strawman arguement. Anything else is simply not Bitcoin. The fee arguement is related to Bitcoin used as a currency, which it is not, **BUT** it should still always be very cheap to transact. The way to do that is to keep the blocksize large enough to accommodate dust transactions supporting a minimal acceptable fee. The dust transactions can be used for contracts such as colored coins, payment channels, or non-Bitcoin consideration within jurisdictional boundaries (such as local currencies).

"The Internet of Money" is technobabble. "Blockchain" will suffice. Bitcoin is about consensus. Consensus isn't about agreement, it's about adoption and competition. You can't have multiple blockchains because society needs standards. Bitcoin was designed with competition built in so you don't need to make your own blockchain to gain advantage. For instance: political disputes over territory may not have everyone in agreement, but competition in the form of conflict resolves acceptance and adoption of territorial borders. Borders are always contested and so is Bitcoin. The Bitcoin blockchain is the only useful map of money because it's competitive. That's just one analogy of a singular standard.

Now we're getting somewhere. Abstraction substitutes specifics with  generalities. This is fine when your generalities are interchangeable. The problem is that there is no accountable way to do this the deeper the abstractions go. This is where faith in invisible hands come in. Why not just stick with barter using tokens to represent specific objects? Allow the blockchain to handle these with smart contracts. Value then is discovered directly through simple supply and demand.

That was part of the noise. If you adjust for ATH spikes you see a smoother and more predictable pattern. Just as most recommend dollar cost averaging, use long term averaging. Remember when it was less than a penny? It had different orders to its pattern. Orders of magnitude have different effects on the overall pattern. It's much like fractals. You never see fractals until they are done forming. When you zoom out, you don't see the fractals themselves, but you do see a recognizable form made by them. Rivers, trees, and human nervous  systems, are all fractals. What you are witnessing with Bitcoin is a measurable social fractal form.

Decentralized markets would make "market makers" unnecessary. HFT is an artifact of poorly distributed networks. If there were thousands of markets, each would serve sellers specific needs. HFT is still possible with payment channels and they would also prevent naked trading. They would also be unable to corner a decentralized market.

Storj as a currency will have it's own problems because disk operating systems have no incentive to keep data safe. They will remove error correction and push the disks beyond safe limits. If they create the incentive, it will cost more energy than simply hashing on ASICs.

This is ideal. It shows the maturity of the Bitcoin ecosystem when it is considered to be a lucrative profession to design, build, and use your own tech.

This is the real fear and why the best and brightest will usually agree. They present their argument and call for action. Lead, follow, or get out of the way. Plenty of altcoins have failed due to ego over intellect. Litecoin should be worth the same as Bitcoin by now if there were any real devs interested in innovation rather than politics in their camp. 
The drama we're experiencing is good. It shows who is on an ego trip and who is objective. Hopefully they learn to adjust to adversarial science and become objective.

The topic is not about retail so fast confirmations don't apply. But since you asked, essentially the risk management is the seller's responsibility.

There's no guarantee that a malicious miner that spends 200 MB worth of valid transactions will find a block or even if they have already found a block it won't be orphaned.

It would be better to create a certificate as an escrow. One key is provided by you with the private key hidden, another public key is provided by the purchaser.

There are several ways to avoid this. First off, you can ask for a down-payment. This is common in service businesses. The balance can be in escrow. Another option is to set up a second counterparty escrow to punish them if they do not abide by the agreement. It requires much more up front, but avoids paying insurance fees, kinda like asking someone to pay with large bills only so you can give them change. There are other scemes, but they will require applications to be designed.

If there was a known bounty on a public official, it would be easy enough to spin it to political advantage against an enemy.

Encryption is often used to secure physical devices like computers. They may also be used to secure centralized servers, like for email. Bitcoin is neither. Sure a wallet file can be secured physically with encryption, but it can also be sucured on the decentalized Bitcoin Network with Brain Wallets. Unless you tell somebody, there is no way for anyone to even know what you have in your head. There would be no physical evidence, no file, or no ip address to trace. There would be no cause for even suspicion that you are storing a cache of Bitcoin in your head.

We are seeing hyperinflation in global markets and commodities are the worst performing compared to derivatives. Commodites are investments for poor people. Whales don't give you price discovery, they play with whatever toys they are allowed. For instance, whales never manipulated gold in the last 5000 years until they could abstract it with ETFs. 
Whales fear Bitcoin because there are no secure exchanges for fiat and it's doubtful they ever will. Secondary layers will give them secure markets to trade contracts (like prediction markets), but they will have to buy their bitcoins from cold wallets because it's just not worth the risk. Maybe we will see whales enter the Bitcoin market, but not until the Gox type markets are gone.

You say you are using Ethereum. That is a money flow of which bad actors can usurp surreptitiously. It is untested vaporware. You use the term "blockchain technology" inappropriately. Building electronic contracts without decentralized "Byzantine Generals" rails opens many security risks that even EC cryptography cannot prevent. When the money is hacked by a MITM attack or your "trusted" anonymous network actors surreptitiously attack strategically at-risk contractors, you'll understand that internet security doesn't exist. Even Bitcoin is not yet ready for smart contracts until they can be taken offline and transmitted via a decentralized platform.

How mining is done has nothing to do with blockchain decentralization. The only thing that matters is there is an open source that anyone can mine using PoW to be truly decentralized. Your security won't benefit from a BBPB because stakeholders can track the Bitcoin transactions and attack specific Ethereum ones. Mixing strong blockchains with weak stakechains makes your stakechains even weaker.
Blockchains are specifically to describe proof-of-work cryptocurrencies because they solve the Byzantine Generals problem. It is the first system that does so. If you can come up with a system that does it also, then you will also have a blockchain. Bitcoin is intended to become a tool for smart contracts. There are work-arounds to make it so already while preserving its security. But really, your product is clearly in the early design phase and is not intended to be a trustless system. It is a secure system within a limited environment where stakeholders can be accounted for. I won't get into the PoW vs. PoS debate here. Clearly you have made your choice.

This is a popular myth. Clearly you did not read the Satoshi White Paper. He predicted mining farms. AFAIK, they still use the open source that anyone can compete with. Bitcoin is still in its infancy.
You can always hash your local data and record its proof on the blockchain, but that doesn't make your record keeping any more secure without the identity of the byzantine actors that use them.

I suggest a compromise. A Seen-by First-Minimum-Fee transaction. The minimum fee would be the fees required by miners and published by mining pools. It will be included in the price indexes and averaged.

The very definition of a national currency is one issued by that nation. You could back a currency with bitcoins and other commodities.
This may seem crazy, but might work:
Announce a plan for gold repatriation. For the interim begin to swap foreign debt for bitcoins at a discount in lieu of the gold that is unaccounted for. Issue a new currency that devalues the old currency, but pegs it on a divested commodities market. Open an official bitcoin exchange that sells the new currency for bitcoins (instead of selling foreign debt).

There's a philosophical distinction between engineers solving problems and theorists trying to find magical formulas for everything. The world doesn't work with magical formulas. That's why we have science disciplines. There is great beauty and function from simplicity as can be demonstrated throughout nature.
There doesn't need to be more than one blockchain because this isn't a struggle for survival, it's a marketplace of ideas and Bitcoin can adapt to new ideas. That doesn't mean there isn't room for competition, but I'll continue to call out false prophets.
Side Chains, Ethereum, and other complex "Turing Complete" systems will fail as money because complexity yields  unintended consequences. They are still useful for financial vehicles, but not money. That's why Ethereum needs ether. It is a mistake to re-invent Bitcoin to power a protocol, which Counterparty has shown. I feel sorry for folks that try to bootstrap disingenuously, because the same will be done to them and it makes everyone look foolish.

Bitcoin's development plan is solid with or without sidechains. They are not as important as many make them out to be. This is becoming like the anonymity or 20MB block debates.

PoS won't scale without becoming centralized. Consumer internet can't handle the bandwidth. PoW has the same issue, but can handle centralization much better because mining pools are identifiable by IP. Miners can change pools if they go bad. Large centralized PoS will become like Ripple.

He uses the term "trust" like a simple variable. He doesn't qualify trust within the same constraints as as a protocol. Trust is anathema to cryptocurrency and should not be used to reverse transactions, but only as absolutely necessary to improve future security.
I know he participates in Bitcoin development, and his accomplishments are noteworthy, but he bites off more than he can chew when he creates a stack like that with only opinion as to it's efficacy. Normally I would dismiss his ideas as conjecture, but he presents it as fact and gets a lot of money for vaporware. IBM can waste their money on experiments, but independent investors and developers are not often aware of how groupthink and cult like behavior can emerge during disruptive technology development.

I never said contracts aren't useful, I'm saying that Turing Machines don't do contracts, they compute a set of data and that's all. Contracts can be simply hashed before feeding it into any Turing Machine and the data compared. It doesn't matter what language you use if you agree to the data set ,format, and how it is parsed.
Ethereum is an interpreted language that is slow and not useful for things like High Frequency Trading. You're better off using a good compiled language.
As far as gas fees go, I suggested that back in 2012 IIRC in that Bitcoin be denominated (I called it Pricecoin) by miners publishing (voting) their minimum fee for the processed block. Ethereum fleshed out that idea with different semantics, but it's completely do-able with Bitcoin. And yes, bandwidth is important. charging based on data used. That's not saying Bitcoin can't optimize the outputs to save space, but even so there are limits. Eth will also hit processing limits. 
The other functionality you mention doesn't benefit from distributed consensus such as time sensitivity and hash verification. For instance, you won't verify every packet of data sent on the blockchain. Comparing results of isolated processes can be done in one transaction and requires an independent oracle to determine accuracy. You might as well just contract by reputation. As far as the mining distribution, it's still competitive and early. Nobody has a better scheme than SHA2x hashing yet. 
On a side note, I don't discount using hashcash of some form to test distributed computing bids that can then be contracted with Bitcoin without using financial bandwidth. There are many ways to skin a cat and don't rely on one tool to solve all your problems.

Okay great, but what problem does that solve? How does this capability have any value? I understand that it is a breath holding contest, but you get nothing from it except bragging rights.

The term Turing Machine doesn't apply to contracts. In fact, it's the opposite. Turing Machines are garbage-in, garbage-out. Contracts need oracles to screen-out garbage. If you need to constantly change the terms and re-sign a decentralized contract it doesn't have any use case and can be done better with a centralised oracle service. LN can be used to pay for RSK (or clone), Ethereum (eth, etc, or clone), or Bitcoin services based on the level of security needed. For most use cases, multisig Bitcoin contracts will suffice for most smart contract needs.

They are limited in by geography and logistics. They are restricted by jurisdictions. Bitcoin stores have failed because they are mismanaged.

They don't face the liability exposure, but offer merchants to choose their Price/Quality/Service ratios. Illegal products will greatly benefit from them, but so will Mom and Pop stores that will save on listing fees.

It's not the code, it's the terms of the contract that change. By definition, the contract needs to change and requires ether or whatever.

One of Bitcoin's biggest "intrinsic values" is its disruptive power as a Black Swan. Another is its distributive and decentralized nature. Also, Bitcoin cannot die.

Bitcoin will stay in families for many generations because they are more secure than even real estate. Bitcoins cannot be abused by power hungry nations for waging war through, hence they support peace and security.

That's just a provably fair game that's been done many times with bitcoins. If a program is bug free, it has a known hash.

You can use existing code in any language modified for transmitting bitcoins.

He is absolutely right, but he is talking about Bitcoin as a protocol, not as a currency. There really isn't a good Bitcoin currency yet. Those are being developed as layers over the Bitcoin protocol. Bitcoin tokens as they are traded now are simply virtual commodities and no better as a currency than gold or silver. If gold or silver were still good currencies, then somebody somewhere would still be using them. This is not a Keynesian vs. Libertarian argument. This is not a political discussion at all. It's not about violence. It's not about good and evil. This is about an emerging technology that can be used any way we choose to develop it. I predict Krugman will shout about Colored Coins, Open Transaction tokens, and Master Coin type currencies from the top of 30 Rock when he finally gets what Bitcoin is really all about.

I see the point of the theory, I don't see the value in using no-risk. Creating value requires sacrifice. What will happen is the same as certificates of deposit, there will be diminishing returns. Especially when there are competing tokens. People will create hedge funds that game insider trading performance against  more honest funds.
I see what you want to do, but Ethereum allows cross-token or even cross-blockchain atomic swaps that can easily be abused through obfuscation and PoS schemes. This leads to quasi-nothing-at-stake attack. The tokens you are invested in can be easily devalued because they are based purely on speculation. Bitcoin mitigates this by placing these tokens on a second layer of a transparent single blockchain created and secured by a single proof of work. Such attacking schemes would have to go through Bitcoin before swapping.
Even if ETH remains as PoW, someone will start a new gas that draws the shiny. This is why I don't see Bitcoin going away and am certain that the "community" will find Nakamoto consensus while Ethereum finds itself frustrated by the conservatism that comes with the wealth of a few influential developers. Well, that and the sad history of ETH dustribution.
tl:dr Derivatives are easy to game leading to diminishing returns. Derivatives can allow nothing-at-stake attacks through obfuscation. Ethereum belongs on top of Bitcoin because ETH has bad blood and is too easily replaced.

When you order steak, do you expect a whole cow? Most people eat mystery meat anyway made from tiny bits of random cow parts.
Most whole bitcoins are usually pieced together from thousands of other bitcoins unless you mined a block. If you objection is the price listing, then look at Berkshire-Hathaway A stock listed at over150K USD per share. They also have a B stock for around 100 USD if that's what you can afford. With Bitcoin, you can buy as much or as little as you want, not just limited to two options.

A small counterparty payment can be made to ensure both sides are not arsehats. If the buyer releases the key for the primary payment, then the seller releases the key for the smaller amount. That small amount would have to be agreed upon in advance and added to the primary payment so the equation balances on both sides. It is far less likely for a seller to fail to send the smaller payment.

Mt Gox has assumed the role of a pseudo-central bank to facilitate the transition away from them. This is done to help people smoothly get into the Bitcoin system. The fact that they instead act like a stock exchange belies their lack of understanding of how corrupt the banking and stock exchanges are. Bitcoin is a stable ecosystem and requires a stable exchange system as well. Stability is achieved by decentralizing. Stock exchanges are somewhat decentralized by placing regulated brokers between them and the public. Banks also have layers of regulation to control the limits of centralized power. Decentralization and separation of powers are well understood by political scientists. Bitcoin is just a tool to make them easier to implement.

Excellent. To make it easier to understand, try to separate the buyers and sellers sections into side-by-side columns or at least by color.
Next there will need to be a small reverse payment as insurance that the buyer actually releases the key. I recommend 10-30% from the seller, and that much added to the buyer's payment.

Gold benefits from the existence of Bitcoin by giving a private and secure means of transferring value. Eventually, the goldbugs will realize that Bitcoin doesn't benefit from the existence of gold at all.

The thing about research papers is that they look at historical data. Bitcoin is pretty new, so there isn't much data yet. However, there is tremendous potential for experimentation. Business is about research through experimentation, not just history. I keep hearing about business students wanting to be a part of the Bitcoin community through research, but none of them are willing to create something new to provide data for future research.
If you are interested in gathering data, you might try collaborating with developers on some new Bitcoin products. Your research on the product success would not only offer you insight on something new, but also help the developers provide the investment community a way to predict future opportunities.

After the collapse of the central banks, there will still be a need for credit. Crony capitalists won't be able to print truckloads of cash for their bankster buddies to trickle down to the peasants. Instead, bankers will need to get to know their local businesspersons. Their decisions will determine their profitability as a bank. Banks will need a more efficient system for borrowing money to loan to their good customers when their own funds are in short supply. A decentralized credit system is useful for such professional institutions.
