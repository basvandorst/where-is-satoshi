@_date: 2016-08-25 05:19:12
good one
@_date: 2016-08-06 11:29:33
how nice of you!
@_date: 2016-08-03 02:33:48
Hey Bitfinex, please do not return after this.
@_date: 2016-08-12 04:10:48
yes, at sha 256 calculations
@_date: 2016-08-14 16:57:30
@_date: 2016-08-31 01:26:20
Yeah those idiots..
@_date: 2016-08-03 02:31:01
not even close to the scale of gox (for multiple reasons) but this stuff pisses me off. I'm more than happy if this incompetent exchange just goes away - or better yet all central exchanges go away and decentralized peer to peer method is used.
@_date: 2016-08-03 02:34:47
Bitfinex, don't ever come back after this shit you morons
@_date: 2016-08-01 20:05:27
@_date: 2016-08-08 03:51:20
I can just smell it. Soon enough they will mess up again and crash the price once more...
@_date: 2016-08-03 02:13:37
get your shit together Bitfinex (or whoever messed up)...you idiots. Can't wait for decentralized exchanges to become a thing :(
@_date: 2016-08-27 18:39:21
I need to be able to use it anywhere for everyday things and not ha e to worry about security
@_date: 2016-08-04 00:30:15
@_date: 2016-08-19 02:26:54
i think most exchanges are still run by amateurs. There may be a select few that are actually run by qualified professionals.
@_date: 2016-08-03 04:37:17
I see!
@_date: 2016-08-04 05:21:38
cheap coins!!
@_date: 2016-08-13 19:22:41
I can't use it securely and conveniently everyday to pay for everything, like I want to do.
@_date: 2016-08-06 01:50:35
@_date: 2016-08-06 06:23:12
why does this make him an enemy again?
@_date: 2016-08-27 01:40:18
Good because less bitcoin scams being advertised?
@_date: 2016-08-03 02:50:32
Not fond of that..
@_date: 2016-08-24 15:08:17
And permanently..

@_date: 2016-08-11 05:44:00
@_date: 2016-04-08 13:49:57
will probably be cheaper transactions and instant. So more attractive for the coffee type transactions

I made my comment on the thread: "Bitcoin is the future. Bitcoin = the internet (borderless, permissionless, decentralized, open-source, bottom-up innovation, immutable, public and for the people, ETC.) and private/permissioned blockchain(S) = the intranet equivalent (closed off, permissioned, centralized, corruptible, top-down innovation). Both will exist - don't get me wrong ;)"
@_date: 2016-04-20 02:47:42
@_date: 2016-04-16 04:14:19
better to buy bitcoin imo
@_date: 2016-08-03 04:13:09

@_date: 2016-04-09 12:22:17
have you looked around the world? Banks are failing to provide the needs for the average (or less) citizens. Not just now but in history - over and over again.
@_date: 2016-04-24 22:50:48
Agree with above comment

Plus much more to come!
@_date: 2016-04-10 15:21:05
support the network and add to the decentralization (by a fraction)

I dont see a bitcoin payment option. I'm from Canada
@_date: 2016-04-01 13:23:16
i just meant, i wanted to know if it used bitcoin
@_date: 2016-04-12 01:00:27
i dont see how this is a valid reason

wooo, i wanted a girl!

It may very well be true. I said I hope it's not true.
@_date: 2018-01-21 10:36:29
aww :(
@_date: 2018-01-06 14:39:02
to be honest the bitcoin qt client from 2011 looks similar to the bitcoin core one today just less modern. basic functionality is similar. send, receive, encrypt. backup, console for commands. (from what i can remember). i never used web wallets but i assume they worked similar as today's but much less secure and inexperienced. oh there was one called armory i remember now which was a bit more user friendly then qt. armory was a desktop wallet as well
@_date: 2016-04-05 05:14:19
me too
@_date: 2018-01-19 15:31:10
@_date: 2016-04-11 05:25:37
pretty stupid of them to remove the option...
@_date: 2016-04-01 02:30:27
@_date: 2016-04-23 03:04:18
perfectly stated
@_date: 2018-01-06 14:40:04
did not trust any 3rd parties to hold it. i used qt at the time
@_date: 2018-01-04 04:33:15
anything under bitcoin is just an interchangeable hot potato game

nothing in this universe is too big to fail - even though I wish this to be the case for Bitcoin. I think Bitcoin is the one, but just keeping it real

uhh no, quite the opposite feeling. This is the internet of money
@_date: 2016-04-02 07:08:15
@_date: 2018-01-13 21:20:48
Ew, I use them too. What a shame
@_date: 2018-01-10 00:05:07
@_date: 2018-01-08 07:54:30
I think it auto inputs a fee on that exchange when I withdraw. I will double check. I don't think it says the fee in the history.
@_date: 2018-01-09 02:45:07
scaling, like the internet. early days
@_date: 2018-01-09 02:45:55
Bitcoin is whatever you want it to be
@_date: 2016-04-23 13:55:46
make sure your qr code is appropriately secured (physically) and uniquely identifiable.
@_date: 2018-01-06 14:33:22
i think physical coins with private keys on them started in 2011 too. casacus coin or however you spell it was the first I believe. he was later shutdown
@_date: 2016-04-13 02:46:52
@_date: 2016-04-16 04:12:58
the most exciting part is the blockchain!
@_date: 2018-01-06 11:52:22
is it possible to sell bitcoin for fiat and deposit into bank using Bisq? I havent taken a look yet but i will in a bit
@_date: 2018-01-21 16:21:43

Definitely do not day trade or cloud mine. Don't gamble more money you can't afford to lose.
@_date: 2018-01-01 07:56:00
yes, most would tell you it is healthy and necessary to not keep going up in price non-stop.
@_date: 2018-01-01 03:01:00
@_date: 2018-01-03 18:45:07
I use Bitcoin
@_date: 2018-01-03 16:13:56
good job fellow hodler
@_date: 2018-01-08 01:11:38
Yes, I remember this happened before
@_date: 2018-01-21 16:19:45
I hope Bitcoin will be able to do this again soon as well.
@_date: 2016-04-24 23:08:37
Thanks Mike!
@_date: 2018-01-19 13:31:26
okay then...
@_date: 2018-01-06 14:28:29
definitely the bitcoin client (now known as bitcoin core, formerly know as bitcoin qt if memory serves me right), the software that IS Bitcoin. Later a lot of insecure or scam online web wallets. Unfortunately, many used gox as a wallet. I imagine a lot of the mining pool websites were inadvertently used as wallets too.
@_date: 2018-01-09 02:45:30

@_date: 2016-04-21 02:57:15
this is 1 year old i think
@_date: 2018-01-13 16:35:02

i dont think so..850 000 bitcoin........

@_date: 2018-01-09 23:13:29
title is inaccurate representation of what he said in the video
@_date: 2018-01-09 02:47:41
altcoins are just a game and not long term. Like penny stocks
@_date: 2018-01-09 02:54:07
buy some then :D
@_date: 2018-01-01 07:54:58
it's just pump and dump. Then after the dump it'll be a bit higher than before usually.
@_date: 2018-01-13 16:33:00

@_date: 2018-01-10 14:53:46
@_date: 2018-01-14 16:13:29
@_date: 2018-01-08 07:59:32
Yeah, it doesn't look like you can add a fee when you withdraw. It does it automatically. It looks like it is 0.002
@_date: 2018-01-05 06:38:16
depends how many transactions per second...billions of transactions per second, each transaction giving a small fee adds up....by that time technology will also be different, energy will surely be different (solar power is bigger?)
@_date: 2018-01-06 16:51:29
I didnt mean tin foil hat if that is what you thought. I mean't make a faraday cage to block the signal if this was a great concern of yours. You could cheaply do this with an every day product tin foil. make sure to test.
@_date: 2018-01-06 14:52:50
ill also add gox existed but to get funding onto the exchange was a nightmare in itself. got  bit better in the end days of gox
@_date: 2018-01-04 04:46:40
write it on a piece of paper
@_date: 2018-01-09 23:34:41
so we're going to the negative valuation?
@_date: 2018-01-12 11:44:09

Are there any negatives to this in terms of the Bitcoin ecosystem?
@_date: 2018-01-03 01:29:33
did you deposit or withdraw 500k?
@_date: 2018-01-06 14:00:28
gox was the main method, like 95% of the market. tradehill and bitinstant may have existed back then although i cant remember (2011 era that is). before that, you didnt really buy bitcoin
@_date: 2016-04-24 14:36:39
@_date: 2018-01-10 00:10:38
could of been a lot easier way to do this
@_date: 2016-04-16 21:25:22
me as well!
@_date: 2018-01-07 16:34:09
my brother had similar but worse experience yesterday with a bank

@_date: 2018-01-13 16:38:51
Need long term vision. The big picture. Of course there are risks though.
@_date: 2018-01-06 09:21:21
china so scared
@_date: 2018-01-21 10:41:05
I don't know anyone that makes actual purchases with any crypto yet
@_date: 2018-01-06 14:13:14
mine it, faucets, get it from someone for free, donations, peer to peer trade/transaction
@_date: 2018-01-13 12:39:33
Its back now with some temp caveats.
@_date: 2018-01-29 01:31:20

you funny!
@_date: 2018-01-06 14:40:31
how come you interested in this info?
@_date: 2018-01-06 14:47:33
i believe gox was around 2010 era
@_date: 2018-01-08 00:45:08
market cap is an extremely poor indicator of dominance
@_date: 2018-01-07 21:42:31
@_date: 2018-01-03 18:47:23
scary O.O
@_date: 2018-01-06 14:34:42
oops i misread your question
@_date: 2018-01-02 19:04:01
yes, that's why it went up..
@_date: 2018-01-05 06:44:46
the only reason i'd buy altcoins is to get more bitcoin. I think almost all of them don't have value :D
Just IMO
@_date: 2019-07-10 20:41:36
Open mind? Lol...
@_date: 2018-01-09 02:43:23
highly unlikely

most of it are the user funds. someone deposits bitcoin or fiat onto the exchange. someone sells their bitcoin to a buyer. someone buys bitcoin from a seller.

Yup, for some reason they cancelled the withdraw shortly after. Then I re-did the withdraw and it worked immediately.
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:14:36
just updated all my ads, haha
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:39:08

Rough estimate of all the bitcoin mined so far (ball park 17 million bitcoin * price of when I made the calc ~19100 usd). I'm somewhat joking but serious as you could put all the bitcoin in the world into something that weighs less than 1 pound.
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:17:23

"breaking news"
@_date: 2017-12-19 03:16:55
I e-mailed them. They did nothing.
@_date: 2017-12-01 02:29:23
he also said: bitchain, lol
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:32:08
volatility doesn't affect them. that'd probably be one of their last worries about Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-06 01:54:27
im ready
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:36:18
good job

I've noticed...

be one with the dip....
@_date: 2017-12-30 08:12:19
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:32:39
cause bitcoin is the internet of money
@_date: 2017-12-26 03:21:42
insightful :)
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:29:40
this would be amazing. although, I do fear about our "current" state of fees/ clogged mem pool
@_date: 2017-12-03 13:33:51
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:34:53
let's get to 50k and 100k first..
@_date: 2017-12-01 02:28:41
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:40:52
excellent, thank you!
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:09:21
if they're CAD friendly
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:39:08
thank you
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:30:41
pretty much
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:24:01
welcome and good job
@_date: 2015-12-26 10:22:07
Merry Bitcoin price drop!
@_date: 2017-12-26 03:04:38
I'm sorry to hear about your early loss. What happens, happens! I've also made many mistakes along the way. Merry Christmas!
@_date: 2017-12-29 15:27:31
@_date: 2015-12-11 03:07:52
i disagree with you.
@_date: 2017-12-03 13:42:45
@_date: 2017-12-28 02:57:08
really....that's what caused this dip...
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:16:25
@_date: 2015-12-25 13:54:48
Agreed, I think everyone should own at least "some" bitcoin. I honestly think that this is Bitcoin's first killer app (store of value/ speculation).
@_date: 2015-12-24 16:15:25
cant speak of coinbase or other companies that will hold the keys for you but if you use a computer or mobile wallet they should have a back-up option that you can store somewhere safe. you could also get the private keys. these would allow you to regain access to your bitcoin in the event of losing your wallet/device
@_date: 2015-12-23 08:19:54
@_date: 2017-12-23 23:56:05
@_date: 2017-12-28 04:20:31
cause it's bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:59:39
@_date: 2015-12-13 17:16:36
when vault of satoshi shutdown as well (cavirtex is back now)
@_date: 2015-12-11 02:46:47
not THE blockchain????? i dont care then...
@_date: 2015-12-24 06:14:46
BUT MOMMY, HE PAID 10 000 BITCOIN FOR A PIZZA!
@_date: 2015-12-19 13:41:00
this is old!
@_date: 2015-12-07 05:33:57
I believe he is one of the larger miners, specifically "finalhash". He was at the Scaling Bitcoin conference on Day 1: 
@_date: 2015-12-07 03:53:31
she believes in THE blockchain!
@_date: 2015-12-25 15:10:57
it's one option, yeah - as long as you do backup and appropriately secure those backup(s).
@_date: 2017-12-31 04:32:10
@_date: 2015-12-29 18:41:42
Bitcoin is just code. Kick back, observe and implement from others if needed. (Just 1 of many that makes a case for Bitcoin). This is just my opinion though and I am NOT sure it will be Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-12-23 15:08:39
if you're a long term holder it doesnt matter in the end
@_date: 2015-12-17 15:47:41
yeah, I was just questioning. Who am I to judge!
@_date: 2015-12-18 04:01:47
something amazing!
@_date: 2015-12-31 15:07:05
the ultimate bitcoin vault - so secure you'll never get them back!
@_date: 2015-12-15 06:33:58
i dont believe that
@_date: 2015-12-01 04:02:11
you might be right..
@_date: 2015-12-12 09:31:56
export the private keys?
@_date: 2017-12-05 10:15:22
the 1 and only main bitcoin exchange mt.gox declared bankruptcy due to a "supposed" hack of over 850,000 bitcoin. Then shortly after, the first China ban occurred that scared the shit out of everyone.
The run up to 1200 happened EXTREMELY fast and in a VERY short period of time. The drop occurred just as fast and a bear market of 2-3 years followed. I also went through the 2011 summer "crash". 
So three things simultaneously occurred for a triple whammy:
1) The oldest, most known and main exchange (when there were super few exchanges available) mt.gox shutdown
2) Mt.gox lost 850,000 of customer Bitcoin due to "hack" (currently worth over 9.8 billion in today's value)
3) People thought China completely banned Bitcoin
@_date: 2015-12-20 21:52:10
i thought a big part about Bitcoin was "choice". if someone wantd to create something on top of bitcoin that had some unique characteristics to Bitcoin they could do that and if some one valued those very same unique characteristics they could go ahead and use the system that the other person created on top of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-12-19 14:20:41
I see, thanks!
@_date: 2015-12-11 03:06:21
@_date: 2015-12-17 16:15:32
i dont trust cointelegraph and never will read their articles

Hi Marshall!
@_date: 2015-12-05 19:44:48
is this using bitcoin blockchain?
@_date: 2015-12-19 15:01:18
hmm okay. One can only hope!
@_date: 2015-12-19 12:58:17
this again...
@_date: 2015-12-19 03:04:39
@_date: 2015-12-25 01:22:20
you're right, life will go by just like that. Thanks for your insight :)
@_date: 2015-12-16 06:08:20
lame...is this the failed canadian mint?
@_date: 2015-12-19 08:20:27
this work in canada?
@_date: 2015-12-17 07:39:12
@_date: 2015-12-13 02:46:28
you can too! (I hope)

who's gray? this quote sounds a bit better..
@_date: 2015-12-25 17:52:55
probably best you contact their support for that answer!
@_date: 2015-12-19 18:05:08
id like to know this as well
@_date: 2015-12-30 22:52:15
he just said he is not a fan of bitcoin but he doesn't know who owns it
@_date: 2015-12-11 06:21:08
you sure its looking at THE blockchain?
@_date: 2015-12-01 14:42:38
blockchains are not like the internet in fact they can be the opposite. but THE blockchain could be like the internet
@_date: 2015-12-13 03:36:36
its growing, progressing, improving and evolving in everyway possible
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:55:30
didnt it only hit 19.5k on gdax? allnthe other exchanges lagged by large amounts
@_date: 2015-12-31 04:15:17
I always thought of that as a feature not a bug. Also, does it matter who satoshi is? The code is open source.
@_date: 2015-12-07 03:58:22
me too
@_date: 2017-12-29 16:33:44
ah I see. Not as good as I first read then.
@_date: 2015-12-17 07:25:59
@_date: 2015-12-12 18:33:43
if you're in it for the long term, i don't think it matters

may the force be with you

interesting...what an amazing global project
@_date: 2015-12-19 16:03:42
a new hope..
@_date: 2015-12-25 14:14:00
exactly, 16 mil you are set for life...just do it "so called right way"
@_date: 2015-12-06 02:26:06
you hit the nail on the head
@_date: 2015-12-07 05:36:36
Also saw him for the first time in this video from a week or two ago: 
@_date: 2015-12-19 13:35:15
right so private blockchains actually remove key innovative attributes (such as global, borderless, ownerless, immutability, openess, censorship resistance, etc - to name a few) of a protocol such as Bitcoin. On top of that they will also slow the pace of innovation due to centralization, over regulation, etc.
Makes sense!
@_date: 2015-12-21 03:06:34
@_date: 2015-12-20 17:51:25
good job bell...
@_date: 2015-12-19 13:12:55
i hope so
@_date: 2015-12-16 02:54:45
@_date: 2015-12-25 13:22:05
wow, now we're talking! Intelligent people.
@_date: 2015-12-28 16:35:06
I have to agree. If Bitcoin fails it will set back the pace of innovation in this area by a decade at least. If Bitcoin fails completely, you'd be insane to think the next day we all act like nothing happened. It will take a VERY long time to recover. Look how long it took to recover just from Mt.Gox implosion (over 2 years, and we haven't reached the peak price yet still)
@_date: 2015-12-31 22:11:21
I don't really get it..
@_date: 2015-12-28 16:28:35
SW is more of a multiplier or optimization for blocksize, isn't it? It's not the solution, but just part of the solution.
@_date: 2015-12-25 13:30:34
well if they ban crypto, they can bet their ASSES we're going to make/use something COMPLETELY anonymous. So, it will get ALOT worse for them and A LOT better for criminals and a lot worse for the innocent...On top of this, they just destroyed over half a decade of innovation and probably slowed down/delayed innovation by a significant amount.
@_date: 2015-12-12 02:48:45
i'd have to agree from my own experience
@_date: 2015-12-13 16:24:14
this is true, currently
@_date: 2015-12-13 02:54:25
exactly, even at much lower numbers
@_date: 2015-12-19 14:11:12
i am new to vpns, but i use airvpn. is this one any good?
@_date: 2015-12-19 14:08:47

Merry Christmas!
@_date: 2015-12-26 10:20:54
you just had to jinx it, didn't you?
@_date: 2015-12-12 07:47:41
Hey Clifford, whats up???
@_date: 2015-12-25 05:01:45
sorry, sure
@_date: 2015-12-19 03:08:08
@_date: 2015-12-19 14:18:33
cool, thanks for your response :) look forward to using it in Canada one day
@_date: 2015-12-28 22:54:08
No worries at all, my comment lacked context. Have a happy new year!
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:48:01
dinosaur, lol. You're funny
@_date: 2015-12-25 19:26:22
transaction fees, increased transactions and increase price will play a PART in this
@_date: 2015-12-11 03:05:15
@_date: 2015-12-16 02:20:16
Bitcoin is that it is a two edged sword right now. You can be hacked if you are careless but at the same time you can make it IMPOSSIBLE to steal your bitcoin through internet/hacks (if you know what you're doing). You dont need vpns, tor, etc. look up cold storage, you can also research multi-sig
@_date: 2015-12-16 03:31:54
yeah, probably the best idea. Collect bitcoin, then forget about them (hold long term)
@_date: 2015-12-29 15:47:50
@_date: 2015-12-13 02:53:02
confident you are
@_date: 2015-12-31 21:55:20
@_date: 2015-12-13 03:10:55
can it not be both is some way?
@_date: 2015-12-24 14:11:38
so funny, but so true..
@_date: 2015-12-15 15:56:06
i thought the exact same thing about the "we"
@_date: 2015-12-31 00:41:12
@_date: 2015-12-09 06:34:37
wow 10 police officers...
@_date: 2015-12-31 21:53:55
banks cannot create their own currency, it will get shutdown!!!!!!!!!
@_date: 2015-12-29 00:47:54
gotta start somewhere!
@_date: 2015-12-12 09:18:16
@_date: 2015-12-12 17:44:07
not bitcoin blockchain - then i dont care
@_date: 2015-12-24 04:04:42
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:05:33
how much money does this "employee" have...
@_date: 2015-12-21 03:37:03
@_date: 2015-12-09 04:46:22
@_date: 2015-12-28 02:39:11
This abuse of centralized power is ironically proving the point of decentralization and things being ownerless, etc. I love it!
@_date: 2015-12-25 04:55:42
In Canada, I believe it is 50% of 50% of the gains made - I wouldn't say that is very small. But yeah, best to just pay..
@_date: 2015-12-28 01:02:53
@_date: 2015-12-24 12:24:51
because, my thinking is: if you're in it for the long haul - bitcoin will either be worth 0 or A LOT (50,000+, it could be unimaginably higher than 50,000 too). So if you bought your bitcoin at 450, or 400, or 1000 will it really matter if you are in it for the long haul?
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:13:25
@_date: 2015-12-24 04:04:01
NO BITCOIN, NO CARE
@_date: 2015-12-30 15:00:42
Yeah, isn't that what blockstream is doing?
@_date: 2015-12-16 03:09:22
may the force be with you...and dont mine with cpus, fpgas or gpus or obsolete asics or current gen asics that have a long wait period to actually receive them. Probably best not to get into mining unless you just want to support the network or have a lot of money to spend
@_date: 2015-12-12 20:55:50
if i live until around 100, that'll be me!
@_date: 2017-12-28 04:19:34
they just want to profit off of us
@_date: 2015-12-05 08:53:49
@_date: 2015-12-21 14:50:25
agreed. this isnt soaring (although nice and welcome)
@_date: 2015-12-19 15:09:00
government please shut him down!
@_date: 2015-12-31 21:57:48
Happy new year! (still 2015 over here at Canada)
@_date: 2015-12-19 17:54:48
@_date: 2015-12-25 04:06:15
I know :( But it's just a little expensive especially because I am canadian. It's much more in CAD
@_date: 2015-12-16 06:07:50
lame...is this the failed canadian mint?
@_date: 2015-12-24 21:12:21
Yeah! By the time 2056 comes around I will be...oh shit...OH MY GOD ILL BE 67 :(
@_date: 2015-12-25 19:56:22
creating the most innovative system ever created in the financial sector while simultaneously freeing the people. Every aspect of this new system is to benefit the people!

I love Bitcoin, Bruce Fenton and Christmas! I loved the last video that I saw you in with Andreas, Gavin and them and seeing some of you get emotional at the end. Such passion in this project.

will do, thank you!
@_date: 2015-12-19 17:55:14
I WANT MY COINS BACK
@_date: 2015-12-07 14:49:25
sorry wrong link: 
@_date: 2015-12-03 04:20:01
so, what they really mean is: nothing like Bitcoin
@_date: 2015-12-19 17:02:54
@_date: 2015-12-28 16:18:14
Sorry, I didn't mean for my comment to attack you. I was just commenting on the fact they didn't adopt Bitcoin..LOL
@_date: 2015-12-19 08:03:05
not yet, that is very obvious. But hopefully soon because this has been the MAJOR topic for a while now
@_date: 2015-12-17 16:09:28
SO INNOVATIVE!
@_date: 2015-12-24 15:39:59
THE blockchain?
@_date: 2015-12-18 14:21:14
0.00000001 = smallest unit
100 million bits per bitcoin
@_date: 2015-12-13 22:13:20
@_date: 2015-12-25 13:17:01
Ah you're correct. Thank you sir!
@_date: 2015-12-17 03:48:29
agreed, it's getting annoying now. you should see coindesk - they are full of blockchain articles.
@_date: 2015-12-13 17:16:03
never heard of digatrade
@_date: 2015-12-21 14:17:30
@_date: 2015-12-01 17:31:44
there probably will be but they need to connect through a main one that holds VERY important characteristics (has value, security, not owned by anyone, censorship resistance, etc)
@_date: 2015-12-24 12:28:45
4 years is pretty good. Not sure if that is long term (call it: medium term? lol). It's certainly longer than a lot of people can bare to hold. I think 4 years is certainly long enough to either see a significant increase in your holdings or a significant decrease (Bitcoin is failing).
Remember 4 years is a LONG time in the Bitcoin world
@_date: 2015-12-20 21:57:46
could you explain?
@_date: 2015-12-20 22:08:17
oh god...
@_date: 2015-12-30 15:12:35
This is true - but in the "end" I think it will work itself out some how (through market forces or something) and if it does not, then Bitcoin simply fails (most likely)..

It's just an excuse
@_date: 2015-12-19 13:44:30
interesting, so we may be overlooking some of these privatw blockchain purposes? will these connect to bitcoin protocol eventually?
@_date: 2015-12-17 03:51:54
50 years is kind of a long time...
@_date: 2018-05-11 06:55:09

I think it was, imo. It was the first bull run that got decent attention and introduced many people to mining for the first time.
@_date: 2018-05-21 15:07:29
@_date: 2018-08-14 05:47:22
VIVA LA BITCOIN!
@_date: 2017-02-19 00:49:07
I don't think so
@_date: 2017-02-08 08:07:19
wrong way rollercoaster (at least time of writing this - lol)
@_date: 2017-02-25 14:41:28
china is bad for bitcoin, first they attempt to crash our price over and over and over again. Now they want to stop legit innovation
@_date: 2017-02-10 02:19:10
F the pboc. Can't wait for these things to have less and less impact.
@_date: 2017-02-23 16:14:35
find him?
@_date: 2017-02-26 04:13:37
Market cap can reach almost anything with current block size. All exchanges are off-chain. But if all those new people are transacting everyday with a 1mb block and there is no 2nd layer innovation - then there would be huge back-log and user experience problems among other issues. 
@_date: 2017-02-04 23:25:54
@_date: 2017-02-17 06:45:20
so you are hating on him because he got the years wrong on "future" predictions?
@_date: 2017-02-21 03:22:38
@_date: 2017-02-24 03:42:44
He has an agenda..
@_date: 2017-02-17 07:54:40
i'm an idiot!
@_date: 2017-02-09 03:07:38
In theory the "stability" should increase with larger market caps because it should be harder for someone to move the price because they need more money to move the price.
@_date: 2017-02-14 05:38:48
i hate them
@_date: 2017-02-08 15:17:11
@_date: 2017-02-22 06:32:08
Bitcoin has been in the wild and open to EVERYONE in the world since 2009. Unfortunately, your friend is uneducated or misguided..
@_date: 2017-02-25 02:21:55
@_date: 2017-02-26 04:04:04
I don't completely disagree - but the market cap is still pretty low so volatility should be expected
@_date: 2017-02-13 19:56:17
@_date: 2017-02-25 02:23:00
@_date: 2017-02-25 22:34:19
or has an agenda..
@_date: 2017-02-20 03:30:28
hmm, I somewhat agree with you. Up-vote!
@_date: 2017-02-24 14:52:52
I doubt that
@_date: 2017-02-25 18:15:43
cool, all the best!
@_date: 2017-02-12 07:51:36
well at least he can take the eth price down with him this time
@_date: 2017-02-15 15:00:19
same they lose my fees too
@_date: 2017-02-10 02:20:54
Reacting better yes but still extremly annoying
@_date: 2017-02-07 18:21:21
don't try to day trade
@_date: 2017-02-13 04:34:00
@_date: 2017-02-13 04:39:40
Bitcoin is going to do metamorphosis!
@_date: 2017-02-25 16:51:02
@_date: 2017-02-13 05:00:59
would segwit then 2-4x the on-chain 100tps?
@_date: 2017-02-21 07:02:04
possible pump and dump lol

much confusion in this person I sense

@_date: 2017-02-23 11:03:36
well, at the high probability of the etf being rejected - i'd say that time will come sometime at or before march 11th...In fact I wouldn't be surprised if it dipped below 1100 temporarily if rejected
@_date: 2017-02-09 03:00:27
nah was just bad timing. Bitcoin goes up and down and is already back to the price you posted this at.
@_date: 2017-02-06 04:03:14
Miners will depend on transaction fees, in theory there should be MANY more txns/sec therefore higher accumulated transaction fees...but who knows what the future holds. Innovation in Bitcoin will never stop coming from bright, passionate  people.
@_date: 2017-02-04 17:27:54
I agree with that - it will probably be a much bigger problem for Bitcoin. For Ethereum, I think it was a huge problem - I don't trust Ethereum and won't touch it with a 10-foot pole.
@_date: 2017-02-23 14:46:42
i agree. The ONLY reason we will see a drop is because traders pumped the price to make a profit should the etf be rejected
@_date: 2017-02-25 12:08:10
this using bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-02-25 02:22:27
china shit getting really old to me
@_date: 2017-02-26 05:49:38
leaders, developers and the community/users in general (hopefully).
@_date: 2017-02-04 00:07:26
oh my god that's amazing!!
@_date: 2017-02-02 05:24:23
ugh please dont tell me he's into that other crap now
@_date: 2017-02-13 14:33:49
i'm not sure if anything will (on-chain)..but I guess never say never
@_date: 2017-02-04 13:27:23
Everyone is entitled to their own opinion - I personally disagree with almost everything you said. But no one knows with great certainty - if they claim to - take their opinion as a grain of salt.
@_date: 2016-01-01 21:26:21
@_date: 2017-02-04 14:26:14
did you watch ethereum with etc?
@_date: 2016-01-10 17:31:22
they did temporarily but was not meant to be permanent.
@_date: 2017-02-01 14:32:57
people won't be buying whole bitcoin anymore?
@_date: 2017-02-08 06:50:20
i'd go as far to say not only do many not fully understand the power of Bitcoin but MISunderstand (sometimes completely) the power of Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-02-24 03:43:13
how come I never see any of these
@_date: 2017-02-06 04:09:07
immutability, digital scarcity, utility, censorship resistance, a public/global ledger, decentralization, network effect, math, cryptography and above all - belief (as it is with anything else in this world). Just to let you know, it's: Bitcoin :)
@_date: 2017-02-11 04:17:17
Bullshit 
@_date: 2017-02-27 14:13:45
I feel that if it succeeds as a store of value, it will then succeed as a currency because it will then be stable. Just my opinion.
@_date: 2017-02-25 16:15:43
nice, congrats
@_date: 2017-02-04 00:25:15
buy, and hold long term
@_date: 2017-02-09 14:19:52
ugh, wtf
@_date: 2017-02-22 00:35:55
china took a break. it's exchange hack time again...
@_date: 2017-02-27 00:50:52
most likely buy coins, although you haven't given too many details
@_date: 2017-02-04 17:49:16
I hope not
@_date: 2017-02-13 20:33:15
I agree
@_date: 2017-02-25 02:24:22
every year since it's inception except for 2014
@_date: 2017-02-22 14:28:28
Well, there are at least two other ETFs waiting for approval as well.
@_date: 2016-01-16 15:00:10
i sense the light in Hearn still!
@_date: 2017-02-09 14:23:03
they are obviously corrupt criminals
@_date: 2017-02-01 14:40:32
that makes it way better!
@_date: 2017-02-25 16:12:52
if you are short term just in it for the money, then yeah. It sounds like you might be in that boat, also sounds like you might be new. This occurs in bitcoin on a monthly basis..
@_date: 2017-02-07 20:57:48
Are you confusing segwit with lightning?
@_date: 2016-03-10 05:52:53
i hope not. im sick of all this blockchain talk
@_date: 2016-03-06 05:49:12
Beginning as in the start of a long journey
@_date: 2017-02-16 14:32:12
wtf lol
@_date: 2016-03-18 02:33:47
you don't have to with Bitcoin, the public blockchain. The beauty of Bitcoin is that is should be an empty canvas. You can do and built on top of it what ever you want.
@_date: 2017-02-22 03:42:19

bitcoin mad at china!
@_date: 2017-02-16 13:23:24
time for us to break up with china? I cant wait for the day they release more bad news and the price goes the opposite direction that was intended or doesn't move at all.

@_date: 2016-03-03 15:57:11
sad top comments
@_date: 2016-03-10 06:07:41
there is no debate, it is quite clear. The public blockchain = the internet equivalent and private blockchains = the intranet equivalent. There will be some use-cases for private blockchains but the real innovation is and will come from the public blockchain.
@_date: 2016-03-06 01:03:19
people are wondering if it is over when it is actually just the very beginning, lol
@_date: 2017-02-10 03:01:41
so if it gets "denied" in march what will we call it then? A "very long delayed deny"?
@_date: 2017-02-08 06:52:33
exciting...if we don't get held back...
@_date: 2017-02-12 07:24:41
just one of the many endless amazing facts about Bitcoin :)
@_date: 2016-03-01 02:22:21
i agree
@_date: 2017-02-25 14:06:55
grats, hope that wasn't all them
@_date: 2017-02-13 20:12:29
I don't think that's correct. The most is 100% (or even higher but that's highly unlikely). But also remember, these claims are dominated in JPY Yen and at the price of roughly ~450 USD at the time of mt.gox announcing bankruptcy. It is still unknown how the ~200,000 + bitcoin will be handled (will they be sold and participants receive fiat? or will the bitcoins be partially sold?). If you had 10 bitcoin in mt.gox, your claim is 10 btc x $450 usd = 4500usd = 511245 yen. If they can sell all the bitcoin on hand @ roughly $2000 USD each that would cover ~100% of the Yen amount owed to creditors AT THE PRICE OF $450 USD per bitcoin. Does that make sense?

@_date: 2016-03-20 12:19:17
@_date: 2017-02-08 08:17:57
yeah, price manipulation
@_date: 2016-03-24 02:23:06
well, the public one can't. Private ones can be tamed, restrictive and manipulated.
@_date: 2016-03-06 00:55:44
Is this different from rootstock?
@_date: 2016-03-09 05:05:08
@_date: 2016-03-22 02:12:53
is the debate about Bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-03-03 04:20:09
I agree but this should also be possible with bitcoin or through a layer built on top of it.
@_date: 2016-03-03 04:15:48
try kraken or bitstamp or an exchange located in your country.
@_date: 2017-02-26 04:09:48
Thanks for protecting us
@_date: 2016-01-23 23:53:31
Yeah and when the first tweet is created we must make a new thread in celebration too!
@_date: 2016-01-02 04:10:37
any time!
@_date: 2016-03-08 02:44:18
agreed - or delay the innovation by a VERY long time
@_date: 2016-01-03 23:46:07
^ what he/she said. don't cpu or gpu mine and arguably don't even asic mine if you are looking to profit. But if you want to help secure the market or mine for fun then go bananas!
@_date: 2016-03-14 02:02:48
They are probably not right now...but I can probably say safely they are laughing at Bitcoin
@_date: 2016-01-15 03:11:52
technically Mike left a while ago...when he went to work for the banks...I guess it was just officially and rudely announced today?
@_date: 2016-01-21 04:02:08
so confident you are
@_date: 2016-01-31 00:09:58
yes, much safer for the teenagers. Thanks for pointing that our media!

price manipulation
@_date: 2017-02-07 19:17:09
@_date: 2017-02-22 15:09:16
it's digital, the bitcoin are not physically inside that device, it is encrypted, it is backed-up (hopefully), it can be stolen and your bitcoin should be safe which should result in less paranoia about keeping your bitcoin safe. There's probably more..
@_date: 2016-01-23 17:07:30
I'm getting the error: the meeting has reached a maximum capacity of 50 users
@_date: 2016-03-02 05:32:51
no? bitcoin, yes
@_date: 2016-01-16 16:17:11
Yeah! Good riddence. Cya later Mike Hearn..oh wait, sorry this wasn't a Mike Hearn related post. lol
@_date: 2016-01-12 02:13:44
15 years before they accept bitcoin is that a joke?

Hey, what's up my favorite nephew?
@_date: 2016-01-13 03:26:05
@_date: 2016-01-16 03:14:33
I believe he fits the very definition of a "traitor"
@_date: 2016-03-02 04:29:55
One can only hope
@_date: 2016-01-27 14:50:06
you feed them by posting this..
@_date: 2016-01-21 04:32:14
that'd be terrific...Bitcoin @ $200,000 each. What are your thoughts on Bitcoin this year Jamie? Jamie Dimon: "ITS A JOKE, IM STILL BULLISH ON PRIVATE BLOCKCHAINS"
@_date: 2016-01-20 04:04:08
@_date: 2016-01-15 03:00:28
my pleasure
@_date: 2016-03-29 05:01:09
how do we fix this???
@_date: 2016-03-29 05:28:05
maybe all wallets should have this feature
@_date: 2017-02-08 08:53:03
scary that one entity can still move the price down 50 dollars in 1 minute
@_date: 2016-01-17 15:36:05
@_date: 2016-01-17 17:31:38
what demise of Bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-01-30 02:51:18
he doesn't know, just as no one else knows...i'd say he's just being conservative.
@_date: 2016-01-24 15:46:36
if they use the bitcoin blockchain, yeah
@_date: 2016-03-12 14:05:11
If you look at the bottom it says "Nederlands" for location.
I thought Microsoft only accepted Bitcoin for the US? I know they didn't accept it for Canadians. It appears to work for US still I just tried..
Edit: nevermind, this only applies to Windows 10 and Windows 10 Mobile. Microsoft still accepts bitcoin
@_date: 2016-01-20 05:16:51
what the hell? lol
@_date: 2016-01-25 14:50:25
but if they had the money to centralize one algo, what would stop them from doing the same on the other 4 algos?
@_date: 2016-01-10 18:44:34
most likely, because the longer he stayed active the higher probability he had of being caught. It would only be a matter of time before he got caught.
@_date: 2016-01-14 03:47:43
too many reasons. But you said without changing it much. So it will already fail to bootstrap because of the way mining works and how we know the blockchain operates now. We know too many flaws that are most susceptible in the early stages.
@_date: 2016-01-22 06:20:09
@_date: 2017-02-25 16:30:39
id say quadrigacx to buy or sell small to medium-small amounts. but if you want to trade, it is shit, because of its low liquidity
@_date: 2016-03-15 02:46:42
yup old news, but fantastic :)
@_date: 2016-01-24 00:11:33

Bitcoin can't be regulated but the edges can be
@_date: 2016-03-08 03:31:58
@_date: 2016-01-03 07:07:55
Educate yourself, when you buy bitcoin don't store it on central website wallet services long term (for medium and large amounts), research how to secure your bitcoin (use a wallet where you hold the private keys), don't invest more than you can afford to lose and know that Bitcoin *could* fail and go to 0. Lastly, know that Bitcoin is very volatile in its early days, so don't get emotional with the swings.
@_date: 2016-01-16 21:50:17
completely agree, i do the same thing. Deep down my feelings are a bit different
@_date: 2016-03-24 04:29:18
id like to see Brave finish their implementation of Bitcoin into their web browser
@_date: 2016-03-12 22:12:11
Microsoft still accepts Bitcoin..they don't accept it for windows 10 and Windows 10 mobile. Note in the BOLD: "Applies to Windows 10 and Windows 10 Mobile". I tried it myself under US and you can fund through bitcoin still
@_date: 2017-02-10 02:23:31
But it's been denied for years on end
@_date: 2017-03-15 10:23:35
I find that list suspect, just IMO though

@_date: 2016-01-13 16:16:26
@_date: 2017-02-13 14:59:53
demand for bitcoin increases if they ban it?
@_date: 2016-01-24 16:05:21
I agree, Bitcoin has to scale in some fashion, either with it's core code or through new protocols/applications built on top of Bitcoin

to buy bitcoin i hope
@_date: 2016-03-11 03:31:59
bitcoin blockchain?
@_date: 2016-01-16 09:32:12
(by one person in an open-source decentralized project)
@_date: 2016-03-14 01:47:40
switch location to: US
@_date: 2016-01-01 13:59:59
no thanks, I want the one that no one owns
@_date: 2017-03-31 04:27:31
@_date: 2016-01-30 23:50:31
Although I appreciate your sentiment, I don't entirely agree.Bitcoin always seems to adapt.
@_date: 2016-03-13 17:00:16
lol, umm no..
@_date: 2017-03-05 21:18:54
I gathered that but I just meant in terms of gaming the system. The pros and cons. Thanks!
@_date: 2016-03-22 07:48:35
disgusting lies...
@_date: 2017-03-06 01:26:16
agreed, his logic makes sense (coming from a non-trader perspective)
@_date: 2016-01-16 15:05:33
yes it is coming. It's an optimization
@_date: 2016-01-16 18:12:44
sums it up pretty well
@_date: 2016-03-11 03:34:41
oh god
@_date: 2016-03-29 02:16:19
on the Bitcoin blockchain
@_date: 2016-01-15 14:41:40
yet the world still spins
@_date: 2016-03-12 16:15:33
cause it is both
@_date: 2016-01-22 15:47:33
You're right. Although it was a reference to the "technology" behind bitcoin - the blockchain..hardly a bitcoin mention.
@_date: 2017-02-24 06:25:15
I thought crash and correction were two different things!
@_date: 2016-03-12 22:15:13
you guys are annoying
@_date: 2016-01-16 03:06:53
exactly, what he did is hypocritical
@_date: 2016-01-30 03:36:01
@_date: 2016-03-04 03:43:18
nice explanation

@_date: 2016-01-15 14:11:24
Thought it was a good discussion and gives some insight on what's going on. Glenn Hutchins seemed very well versed about Bitcoin: 
@_date: 2016-01-23 17:25:07
I think completely ignoring them and never mentioning it will eventually get them to stop...a troll needs fuel to feed its fire. If you don't respond/react they can only stop

@_date: 2016-01-15 03:15:54
@_date: 2016-01-22 14:54:46
Bitcoin was not mentioned verbally or in text...
@_date: 2016-01-22 04:33:54
who is this?
@_date: 2016-01-21 14:50:34
why is this caused by greed at the top?
@_date: 2016-01-18 04:24:56
agreed, but i doubt that will happen anytime "soon"
@_date: 2016-01-19 14:48:38
and not the first version of itself, or even close to the last version of itself
@_date: 2016-01-13 06:11:48
@_date: 2017-03-10 04:58:24
right before, as in before the decision is even made? (aka in 1 day or less?)

what a guy..
@_date: 2016-01-15 04:03:43
np, just my humble opinion
@_date: 2016-01-16 14:36:13
in reality, it is Hearn who has failed..ironic
@_date: 2017-03-08 08:30:59
the opposite? 
@_date: 2016-03-02 15:48:33
I agree with the others, Bitcoin is the internet equivalent.
@_date: 2017-02-21 14:59:07
bitcoin is the internet. Why wouldn't they use the internet? It's neutral and no one owns it.
@_date: 2016-03-12 16:38:18
you left Bitcoin because of a sub reddit?
@_date: 2017-02-21 23:03:09
@_date: 2016-01-16 14:58:11
rootstock coming?
@_date: 2016-01-16 09:17:40
very well, i respect your oponion as my opinion is just speculation as well :)
Im mostly basing my view off of the new beyond bitcoin video released and the comment made by the r3 guy
@_date: 2016-01-16 08:12:18
agreed but if bitcoin gets stopped expect a delay in innovation and something similar displacing it to take a decade PLUS longer or the chance of it never happening
@_date: 2016-01-10 18:34:44
I agree, they are ignoring Bitcoin (i guess you could somewhat call it early fighting stage too..), although somewhat less than before..
@_date: 2016-01-12 02:32:29
he is an expert!
@_date: 2016-01-16 03:23:59
nope im going to buy a couple thousand dollars worth :)

great job!
@_date: 2017-03-15 10:19:54
longer confirmation times and higher fees
@_date: 2017-03-05 15:37:18
@_date: 2016-01-19 02:15:48
there is very very little innovation left when you create private blockchains
@_date: 2016-03-03 01:37:24
No, I mean Bitcoin. Private blockchains are the intranet equivalent...

no, i think he should say something if this is something that is on-going
@_date: 2016-03-13 19:55:40
Awesome, more articles about something not true..
@_date: 2016-03-09 03:13:53
is bitcoin already integrated? Or is it under development still?
@_date: 2017-03-02 15:18:47
@_date: 2016-03-21 16:00:07

how do you know? where are you getting your info from
@_date: 2016-01-25 14:54:08
if algo is always changing and some have less support than others does that in any way open security attacks on the network? it would seem it would take less and less resources to attack a given algo the more we add to the equation

maybe a tiny bit, but i'm quite content with my bitcoin holding now.
@_date: 2016-01-16 15:30:14
i agree and disagree. thanks for your explanation.
@_date: 2016-01-16 03:15:09
@_date: 2016-01-17 16:00:29
"it", lol. 
I'd say gox was much more than 10x worse than 1 person's opinion and announcement that he left bitcoin. On top of the fact that he literally left Bitcoin months before this announcement and this is an OPEN project. These events shouldn't even be comparable.
@_date: 2016-01-16 03:11:11
it is a dick move yes, but probably intentional and planned by r3
@_date: 2017-03-17 03:06:21
I don't trust most advice from Vitalik

(as everyone watches their plan temporarily disrupt Bitcoin)
@_date: 2017-03-18 20:47:56
Even if he did, it would be highly suspect
@_date: 2017-02-07 20:51:20
I don't claim to know. But I think not
@_date: 2016-03-24 04:27:28
@_date: 2016-01-21 03:49:24
yes but not just as a currency
@_date: 2016-01-02 04:16:54
not many - in terms of "running smoothly". In terms of security, that's another thing.

2nd that quadrigacx is good. Im canadian too.
@_date: 2016-01-16 14:53:30
can you explain why you feel it is not decentralized? and also explain why it is so hard to do a change in Bitcoin's protocol? To my knowledge Bitcoin is still more decentralized than any financial system in the world or to go further more decentralized than any system in the world or at least one of the most.
@_date: 2017-03-18 14:56:34
no one wants unlimited, some people DO want a blocksize increase

@_date: 2016-01-15 03:47:15
I would say so. he could of said nothing or left gracefully. Instead he says its a failed experiment and that he sold all his bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-01-26 03:05:20

@_date: 2016-01-16 02:54:46
agreed, they are in for a BIG suprise
@_date: 2016-01-17 13:20:42
from my understanding you can still do it. but if it gets stuck you can pay a fee to get it unstuck (I THINK). RBF is optional. Someone correct me if i'm wrong please!

of course not lol

@_date: 2017-03-21 09:36:16
No worries - I totally understand your position and everything that is going on. I've never had a problem before and my lack of experience made me ask the wrong question and in the wrong method. Cheers and keep up the great work. We're on the same side! :)
@_date: 2017-03-11 02:48:17
good point, good point
@_date: 2016-01-16 14:14:13
thanks, i must be new here then :p
@_date: 2016-01-19 07:02:31
i agree
@_date: 2016-01-02 03:06:45
It's not impossible but creating a private blockchain removes the core principles of Bitcoin. The true innovation isn't the blockchain, IMO. What makes the blockchain innovative and disruptive is that it is owner-less, decentralized, an immutable ledger, censorship resistant, global consensus, permission-less, border-less, etc. (reminiscent of the internet)
Removing Bitcoin from blockchain compromises security, severely reduces the pace of innovation along with many other negative impacts on the system as a whole. In doing so, you end up with an inefficient databases that we've used for quite some time now (with a TINY bit of innovation mixed in)
@_date: 2016-01-17 15:50:52
lol, maybe he should quit the world
@_date: 2016-01-03 05:54:05
Happy genesis!

It's the only one I trust, esp with important data at the moment
@_date: 2016-01-16 03:19:13
But I must say, based on Bitcoin's past performance and anti-fragility, MORE good will come out of this :)
so...thanks r3! cheap bitcoin for me and Bitcoin gets much stronger. WIN WIN. You idiots dont know what you just did
@_date: 2016-01-02 03:35:40
exactly, if it's a good change than most likely consensus will form and everyone will upgrade and the change gets implemented. Just because a dev proposes a change does not mean it automatically gets magically auto implemented. 
@_date: 2017-02-19 00:55:57
I think if you followed the history of bitcoin since the beginning to now you would know
@_date: 2017-02-22 06:47:58
no idea, I hope we scale properly though.
@_date: 2017-03-15 09:55:55
thank you core
@_date: 2016-03-01 04:46:33

@_date: 2016-01-21 15:40:59
technically they would use Bitcoin if they could. They will use whatever wins
@_date: 2017-03-12 01:25:49
I disagree
@_date: 2016-01-14 04:13:36
right, thanks
@_date: 2017-03-09 05:03:35
I just don't think that an ever increasing blocksize can't scale without having huge and very few centralized data centers which compromises the decentralization of Bitcoin, thus the security and censorship resistance of Bitcoin (and thus other important features of bitcoin - it's a cascading effect). Did that answer your question?
@_date: 2016-01-12 15:04:49
In 15 years I question if they will even exist...

For gold 2.0/speculation/store of value/hedge very little. For daily transactions a lot IF there are no 2nd layer on top of bitcoin or some sort of scaling
@_date: 2017-03-18 15:40:10

@_date: 2017-03-17 00:18:05
So true
@_date: 2017-03-09 04:23:01
Exchanges do not use the bitcoin protocol. You buy and sell bitcoin on their exchange with the bitcoin already stored on their central servers. When you buy bitcoin, they simply credit your account internally. I'm talking about on-chain transactions or a 2nd layer on-top of bitcoin that actually utilizes the bitcoin tokens in some fashion. Wallets can do instant transactions but those are called 0-confirmation transactions which are insecure (especially for high-value transactions). A few days ago I sent ~$20 for donation and the fee was around 74 cents CAD.
@_date: 2017-03-18 20:33:26
@_date: 2017-03-14 14:24:21
let's hope so
@_date: 2017-03-11 02:45:55
@_date: 2017-03-08 08:40:02
that's not what I gathered from their released statements today but maybe i'm mis-interpreting
@_date: 2016-01-17 16:40:27
I was referring to the act of copying and pasting articles like you said they do. Ignorant was referring to the title of this post. So they do one or the other..which is worse?
@_date: 2016-01-10 16:42:27
@_date: 2017-03-04 13:25:53
of course
@_date: 2017-03-09 14:44:21
but the SEC has never made a no decision, ever
@_date: 2016-01-01 00:04:21
Hope this goes well!
@_date: 2017-03-09 04:34:21
Agreed it would be amazing but it probably won't happen on-chain, which to be honest, i'm fine with - dependent on the characteristics of the 2nd layer protocol

@_date: 2017-03-08 08:18:22
I find some of the statements not encouraging and instill doubt about the future..maybe i'm misinterpreting some of their statements?
@_date: 2017-03-10 03:19:23

@_date: 2017-03-11 02:02:24
this is our internet, I believe in it
@_date: 2016-03-12 23:06:40
This also occurred on smaller scales for other alts as I remember such as NXT and a few others that were said to be way better than bitcoin and will replace it.
@_date: 2016-01-24 15:40:52
Yeah, I don't think they mean the blockchain as in the Bitcoin blockchain
@_date: 2017-03-15 10:09:12
@_date: 2016-01-12 13:39:38
the question for these large merchants should no longer be "why accept bitcoin?" rather "why NOT accept bitcoin?"

You should be worried about a split as in the reputation of bitcoin if it occurs. Financially, you should have the exact same number of coins on both chains - what you do after that is up to you.
@_date: 2016-01-15 15:36:11

its already the best and is programming so if a new feature comes along that Bitcoin can use why not implement it into bitcoin instead of starting all over again just because a coin with a new feature appears?
@_date: 2017-03-11 02:51:41
god, look at that smirk
@_date: 2016-01-13 03:28:37
then i'd say no you wouldn't be stupid
@_date: 2016-01-31 18:48:04
some people do :p
@_date: 2017-03-01 03:44:24
@_date: 2016-01-17 15:11:28
i thought this would decentralize things?
@_date: 2016-01-21 03:24:26
This banker is always on the defensive when speaking of Bitcoin. I wonder why..
@_date: 2016-01-10 18:35:50
I am Canadian and paying attention for a long time now
@_date: 2017-03-04 16:31:55
how come you removed?
@_date: 2017-03-16 09:21:42
was he a BU supporter?
@_date: 2016-01-20 06:09:01
1 and it's in my name
@_date: 2016-01-21 04:15:22
yeah...i do
@_date: 2016-01-23 22:03:07
Welcome to 2016! :p
@_date: 2017-03-11 01:59:21
me too
@_date: 2016-01-16 18:24:40
So it is nothing short of a miracle that we got through 7 years from starting at nothing?
@_date: 2017-03-17 12:19:38
well put, time after time I heard: "this altcoin will replace bitcoin, this altcoin is better then bitcoin". Also the pump and dumps...
@_date: 2017-03-04 11:19:50
jebus lol, all incorrect...
@_date: 2017-03-16 01:03:36
sell 5 million in any of those alts and watch what happens
@_date: 2017-03-25 15:31:32
@_date: 2017-03-11 02:14:24
because it's our internet
@_date: 2017-03-19 05:17:31
They already have two.
@_date: 2017-03-27 05:33:06
good, good....
@_date: 2017-03-12 23:26:58
Both blockchains will have the same amount of bitcoin on them. But the value on the "alternate / secondary chain" will have significantly less value than the primary chain and the value on the primary chain will drop.
@_date: 2017-03-18 00:40:14
I got mine up 24/7 now!
@_date: 2016-01-16 16:18:25
Bitcoin hasn't failed...
@_date: 2017-02-07 18:14:57
When will bitcoin be considered as NOT an experiment? Just curious what you think.
@_date: 2016-01-15 02:41:20
so he gives up and works for the banks. bravo
@_date: 2017-02-12 13:59:07
yes, we recovered a few times already just recently..
@_date: 2017-03-08 08:12:06
@_date: 2016-01-17 04:19:19
maybe its the prank coin community
@_date: 2017-03-10 03:11:27
what's next? The three generals problem?
@_date: 2016-01-23 02:53:07
When can I use it?
@_date: 2016-01-21 16:11:10
I see, thank you
@_date: 2017-03-15 14:11:47
nah, I don't really care
@_date: 2017-03-04 16:27:32
I was wondering what was taking so long for a price post!
@_date: 2016-01-16 21:06:39
just googled Glenn: 
@_date: 2017-03-26 22:51:28
doubt it
@_date: 2017-02-19 04:23:14
no, your not missing anything. I felt the same - although it was decent and I appreciate the work and effort, no doubt.

There are many reasons why they could be blocking segwit - all of which are poor reasons, IMO
@_date: 2017-03-21 08:25:32
from what I know, no one doesn't want segwit. Also, it is also backwards compatible and you dont need to use segwit once activated if you don't want to. Roger just today in an interview said unlimited likes and wants to do segwit
@_date: 2017-03-11 02:21:44
SEC MAKE BITCOIN MAD!
@_date: 2017-03-16 09:05:05
there is an entire market predicated on making money on altcoins some by very obvious pump and dumps. Speculation and trading

hmm, in that case which of two means of media is worse? Blatantly deceiving or blatantly ignorant?
@_date: 2016-01-03 23:36:01
Yeah, i've noticed that as well. I have ALWAYS been asked how many bitcoin I own...then they ask what I am going to do with them, like sell them, etc...
@_date: 2016-01-25 03:20:20
There will never be a president of Bitcoin
@_date: 2016-01-16 18:15:47
of course you can divorce the token from the blockchain. But then what the hell do you have and what value does it bring..
@_date: 2017-03-18 06:14:56

@_date: 2016-01-01 16:50:45
I feel this is not entirely true..regarding old tech being able to run todays stuff at appropriate performance levels esp from tech of 5-10 years ago. I'm not talking general purpose stuff but the more demanding things that require more powerful hardware.
@_date: 2017-03-11 02:13:33

I already run a full node, this make me want to purchase a miner. That'll be an expensive investment though..
@_date: 2019-03-30 07:19:29
Just Bitcoin please
@_date: 2017-03-04 13:18:24
be a long term holder
@_date: 2017-03-16 09:28:10
I agree Bitcoin already has to fight against the world in an uphill battle.
@_date: 2017-03-20 03:36:42
@_date: 2017-03-16 01:11:13
@_date: 2016-03-12 22:14:38
just to clarify, an exchange should not be used as a bitcoin wallet
@_date: 2016-01-15 03:29:01
exactly, he left a while ago..and now rudely announcing it just now..
@_date: 2016-01-24 05:07:55
If true, thank you!
@_date: 2017-03-08 03:35:26
@_date: 2016-01-14 03:48:28
and if they do a private bitcoin it defeats the purpose of why Bitcoin was invented.
@_date: 2016-01-16 14:15:00
thank you sir. how come i kept reading about something making coding easier? is that true?
@_date: 2016-03-20 04:38:03
public key auto detect got removed? Although it never worked I was looking forward to that feature. Uninstalling now.
p.s eth addition was a turn off.
@_date: 2016-01-28 03:28:45
you mean last, last, last week
@_date: 2016-01-16 08:55:38
they just attacked bitcoin and you really believe that?
@_date: 2017-03-01 03:58:02
sorry i was just copying the others. I have no idea what the ETF decision will be or what increases or decreases the probability of a rejection or a pass
@_date: 2016-01-16 03:47:51
@_date: 2016-01-16 03:35:55
I have great faith in Bitcoin but I have to agree with your statement. It's quite ridiculous. But as always, it's never a problem WITH Bitcoin it is problems around Bitcoin..
@_date: 2016-03-12 23:10:25
isn't this false? If so, poor job on cointelegraph's part. Although I can't say they were great to begin with...
@_date: 2017-03-04 10:39:11
well, at least he is doing ethereum now. Am I right?!
@_date: 2017-03-04 10:47:01
interesting, is it possible that there can be different miners (like there are different bitcoin clients - i guess technically different miners = different bitcoin clients) that can co-exist on bitcoin but be utilized in that manner that you described? I think I just confused myself
@_date: 2017-02-22 04:20:46
@_date: 2016-01-17 07:02:03
some people laughing at his "bitcom" and almost everyone staring at him like he's an idiot..

@_date: 2016-03-10 03:47:13
@_date: 2017-03-14 04:53:18
segwit good, hardfork bad
@_date: 2016-01-14 04:10:57
because the protocol must be owned by no one, cannot be changed by anyone, etc. A government one will not be this and if it is not this then what is the point of creating a government bitcoin? To track everyone?
@_date: 2016-01-16 18:48:11
well he said, right now he still believes it will be the winner but long term it likely wont. I think he is just being safe. To be honest I say "almost" the same thing. (instead I just say we don't know what the future holds for Bitcoin and it is high risk still) Although deep down I want it to win and I know it has a better chance to make it then I talk about. But in the end we all still dont know. Someone can say 1%, 10%, 50% , 90% chance..someone will be right..
@_date: 2017-03-18 04:34:28
i knew that guy was scum
@_date: 2017-03-18 00:38:17
No, do you not see the price dropping a few hundred dollars already. One will regain it's price and continue upwards. The other will most likely continue to exist but stagnate in price
@_date: 2017-02-20 08:49:42
cool never seen this one before
@_date: 2017-03-11 08:56:53
@_date: 2017-03-07 06:53:06
shit i'm running 2 or 3!
@_date: 2017-03-11 03:09:53
well they certainly pissed people off
@_date: 2017-03-22 04:39:09
This is disgusting. I don't understand how anyone can logically support these people unless you have some sort of motive..
@_date: 2017-03-10 02:26:57
Waiting to see who will win a great boxing bout
@_date: 2016-01-20 05:05:34
Agreed. This private blockchains versus public blockchain (Bitcoin) is equivalent to intranets vs the internet. The true innovation comes from Bitcoin/ the internet.
@_date: 2016-01-30 23:46:22
Could make more investing in Bitcoin and holding?
@_date: 2017-03-09 04:27:51
how will secure, instant and cheap transactions work? I'm not entirely sure (hence all the debating on the scaling issue). But i'm leaning towards a 2nd layer on-top of bitcoin versus an unlimited blocksize limit to accommodate increasing demand. I think a large part of the scaling debate is over the supposed scaling demand that is needed NOW vs. the future
@_date: 2017-03-09 16:05:54
lol, wish i had tomorrow off :( . But i'm also reading people are saying the decision is on monday..
@_date: 2016-01-03 23:30:00

@_date: 2016-01-31 05:34:56
Because it is reminescient of the internet. Bitcoin is a globally decentralized protocol that is open, distributed, permissionless, borderlesss, immutable (irreversible/permanent), ownerless, censorship resistant, non-duplicable and connects the world financially (and more). In addition, it is faster, cheaper, more secure and programmable (in other words - designed for the internet). It's the needed base to support more complex applications and protocol layers. It's also digital scarcity - capped at a maximum of 21,000,000 bitcoin. There is more but i'll leave it at that.

@_date: 2017-03-11 02:06:36
I won't even be paying attention lol. Don't care anymore. Bitcoin will succeed with or without
@_date: 2017-03-07 03:03:20
it's a good idea if they can secure it properly but it's still a huge honey pot central point

Same. It's fucking annoying as hell. I emailed the.company I was paying to replace them with another processor. COUGH "namecheap"

@_date: 2016-06-16 04:12:13
not sure if you are for cloud mining or for purchasing bitcoin
@_date: 2016-01-16 09:43:11
can someone explain what classic is
@_date: 2017-03-06 01:39:23
You most likely won't make anything mining (will actually lose money, possibly). Right now most effective is to buy and hold bitcoin or earn them through providing products or services.
@_date: 2016-06-21 07:07:55
to scare people like you and take advantage
@_date: 2016-06-30 13:31:18
they can because exchanges are mostly offchain and these users wont be using bitcoin daily because well, it's not easy too yet
@_date: 2016-06-23 03:20:25
@_date: 2019-11-04 01:27:33
Bitcoin not blockchain. Get with the times. Most people don't need to know how blockchain works. Just, why Bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-06-22 14:12:32
layers on top of bitcoin, optimizations and never-ending scaling
@_date: 2016-06-24 04:32:15
you know buy those blockchain tokens and bag hold!
@_date: 2016-06-18 21:01:24

gold is currency?
@_date: 2016-06-17 01:11:50
So we hold the private keys but how does the blockcain database part work? Do they  control the power to manipulate or rewrite the history of the blockchain?

@_date: 2016-06-21 07:01:09
yay...they only dropped the price 10%
@_date: 2016-06-24 13:26:55
so 770?

Not really, i'm sure it will get fixed for you - contact their support, as you probably have already. As long as you aren't hiding any weird details. Was just giving a genuine "good luck" and to your endeavor with eth.

@_date: 2019-11-01 17:37:38
The premine? The presale? Over 70% over existing supply was premined? It's a scam money grab to feed off of suckers? It's a scam that all it did was breed many more scams on top of it? It's broken and full of half-baked ideas that will never work and they KNEW would never work? Eth 1.0 is broken and they have to build a completely new etherium now? The creators actually SAID that they KNEW it was broken? It's centralized and therefore not secure? It does what 1 person says it will do? Almost NO ONE can run a full node further pointing out the centralization? Almost NO ONE uses DAPPS? It dosen't scale? When they try to make up "innovation", it breaks instantly?

i dont know one place i can spend physical, digital gold or paper gold - nevermind the difficulties of dividing physical gold to spend. It's like a rock (i know it's a metal - but it's as useless as a rock to me) we used to trade thousands of years ago in the stone age....oh wait it was used for that!

id say bitcoin gets so popular that the whole system gets completely back-logged - said the same thing 1 year ago to my bro when the next bubble comes. not much has changed yet to persuade me otherwise.
@_date: 2017-01-08 06:52:49
interesting - thanks for your insight. So this could just keep occurring if loans just keep coming and going (i'm no expert - just trying to understand)

hmm, interesting. I am still skeptical but with open mind :)
@_date: 2017-01-23 15:02:24
i'd be wary of the "authorized" vpns and why they were labelled okay.
@_date: 2017-01-06 04:49:12
leave it to exchanges and wallet services to fuck with the prices ;)
@_date: 2017-01-13 03:21:01
I concur...
@_date: 2017-01-20 04:03:11
but, but..china ban bitcoin....
@_date: 2017-03-15 02:30:43
I have absolutely 0 confidence in Bitcoin Unlimited now.
@_date: 2016-06-23 03:05:05
in which way?
@_date: 2019-11-13 12:16:36
@_date: 2017-01-21 02:50:27
just what I always wanted!
@_date: 2017-01-06 13:52:16
so basically nothing bad happened and the price dropped
@_date: 2017-01-01 18:23:30
good luck!
@_date: 2017-01-09 04:35:57
@_date: 2017-01-06 13:40:43
this is getting tiring..if PBOC just so happen to lift a finger in the direction of bitcoin we drop $50
@_date: 2016-06-17 14:15:21
not really, gox was MUCH worse and add that the goxxing happened shortly after the supposed china ban

i likey!
@_date: 2016-06-16 03:10:31
@_date: 2017-01-01 18:03:30
impossible to say, we don't even know what the price will be in a week from now (quite honestly, even 1 hour from now is unknown)
@_date: 2017-01-08 16:20:15
interesting if this is better, is it gaining any traction?
@_date: 2017-01-22 21:46:15
well, i'm never using them again. Any one know why they stopped?
@_date: 2016-06-24 14:16:32
i dont get the video..
@_date: 2016-06-25 16:07:03
it'll get there...it will take over the internet payments at at much faster pace than physical stores. But systems will be built in the future to seemlessly pay at physical stores via bitcoin even if they don't accept bitcoin. Remember, Bitcoin is only 8 years old and for the first 4 years it was almost completely unknown and ignored. Gold is thousands of years old and the fact that it's still here is amazing but its time will come.
@_date: 2017-01-08 02:49:03

@_date: 2017-01-16 02:49:20
only one way to find out for sure!
@_date: 2017-01-18 14:32:27
so they dont want to use the internet, okay..
@_date: 2016-06-16 03:52:13
I only have a trezor and I like it. Although I really just use it to store btc and use as a watch only wallet in mycelium wallet then make back-ups. Using it to spend via your phone you'd still have to connect it to your phone via physical usb cable which I find inconvenient and awkward should I ever pay in a brick and mortar shop. Connecting it to your phone to pay for online is a little bit better than using it in a physical store.
@_date: 2016-06-19 05:39:56
haha, i get it
@_date: 2016-06-07 03:17:27
lol, what am I reading??
@_date: 2017-01-02 16:07:13
tbh, the price was generally going up throughout all of 2016 with a few glaring exceptions
@_date: 2017-01-15 15:40:14
@_date: 2016-06-23 03:04:27

@_date: 2017-01-01 18:05:58
dont forget existing technology being converted into atms as well. Example: the swiss train system machines all allow users to buy bitcoin. I forget exact location.
@_date: 2017-01-10 06:34:56
if you believe in bitcoin, will be holding long term and not trading - almost any time now is fine to buy, imo
@_date: 2019-11-13 12:19:48
Thank god.will this get rid of it completely? Or can bitpay just not upgrade?
@_date: 2017-01-10 15:33:55
@_date: 2017-01-03 05:04:26
Some say an out-right ban would increase the price. I haven't really dug into the details of that belief - just something I've heard/read.
@_date: 2017-01-18 14:28:09
i feel like the pump to 900 was purely intentional in that they knew this announcement was coming..I cant wait until that bs doesn't work anymore
@_date: 2017-08-07 14:32:38
you don't think every single other coin is volatile? it is early, the volatility will go down in the distant future and there is probably no way around that except for services that work around it like bitpay for merchants.
@_date: 2016-06-22 14:46:58
nothing is set in stone at this point - so it's impossible to say :)
@_date: 2016-06-17 05:46:05

@_date: 2017-01-04 14:38:25
Just to elaborate, private keys gives you access to your bitcoin and in  a sense 100% ownership (as long as only you have that private key). 
In an exchange and most online web wallets YOU DO NOT have private keys. The exchange has full control of your bitcoin. If it gets hacked, shutdown or has an inside job which has occurred over and over again, your bitcoin are most likely gone.
For most downloadable Bitcoin wallets and hardware wallets YOU have the private keys and no one else - meaning NO ONE can take your bitcoin if you secure them properly.
@_date: 2017-01-08 03:05:46
@_date: 2016-06-25 17:25:57
that why price is dropping?
@_date: 2016-06-29 13:34:12
hmm that actually seems convenient if optional (for shopping purposes)
@_date: 2019-11-25 07:22:41
@_date: 2017-01-15 12:58:24
I agree, lack of convenience with security to spend and lack of merchants accepting bitcoin directly prevent me from using every day -otherwise I would.
@_date: 2017-01-21 03:56:24
same here
@_date: 2017-08-05 23:55:50

large increase in number of transactions per second = higher transaction fee total. Electricity may also be much cheaper in the future due to technological advancements. Who knows maybe some genius(es) will also create some new change or improvement for mining.
@_date: 2017-01-06 06:36:49
Welcome! Good to have you on board!
@_date: 2017-01-11 15:10:55

increased number of transactions and in result increased transaction fees to miners. But who knows, this is a LONG time from now and maybe some genius(es) will invent something. Also hopefully energy is much cheaper or solar, or something...

i just like watching bitcoin videos, that's all. Some people I like watching than others. But yeah, you're probably right - their's only so much you can say without being completely submerged in the bitcoin ecosystem with some technical knowledge. Might just end up repeating the same stuff.
@_date: 2017-01-03 01:11:36
if you are long term, it is less dangerous. If you are short term, in it for just the money and inexperienced - you'll probably reduce your investment by a significant amount

I'm not saying you are a liar- but purchasing 1 BILLION usd worth of bitcoin in a short time frame would push the price of bitcoin far beyond a couple hundred dollars. Also, 1 billion usd worth of bitcoin being purchased in this short time frame doesn't equate to an exact 1 billion dollar market cap increase - in fact it if this really occurred as you say it did, the market cap would of increased much more. I believe as of recent, an increase in bitcoin price of $60 results in an increase in market cap by 1 billion usd but in no way represents $1,000,000,000 usd being invested INTO bitcoin purchases.

this global, public, open, borderless, decentralized, permissionless, censorship resistant, ownerless technology is a living project that will probably never stop innovating and pushing the boundaries of technology and innovation like the internet. The bulk of innovation sure as hell isnt coming from a private government blockchain - not global, walled garden, closed, not borderless, central, permissioned, censored and extremely regulated.

lots of things were banned previously, including gold.
@_date: 2017-01-01 17:51:12
If my memory serves me right - bitcoin has ONLY ever "crashed" in price from large (sometimes not even significant) short term "problems". Mt. Gox lagging and technical problems, mt.gox hack, china supposed "ban", hearn's announcement, bitfinex hack, etc. I don't think i've EVER seen bitcoin price naturally go down by a large amount - it was always caused by some weird phenom.

mining supports the network but you may not get back your ROI. If you start mining with 100,000 you'll have a lot more external expenses than just buying the miner. example: storage, electricity, equipment such as cooling, internet, maintenance, time, etc. A limited amount of $100,000 would be better spent on buying, imo. Remember to research how to secure your bitcoin before buying if you dont know how already.

Doesn't segwit technically resemble a blocksize increase in that it is fitting more "txns" into a block WITHOUT increasing the blocksize? I don't get why resist something that both increases the transactions per second and avoids increasing the blocksize. Is that not a "win" for BOTH sides? (as in one side gets their more transactions per second and the other side does it without a blocksize increase) And that's not even everything that segwit does.. Can we not wait and see what happens after this blocksize increase resembling code is implemented?
@_date: 2016-11-18 03:54:30

IMO: they are okay - from my recollection they've never had a hack that lost customer funds (YET), maybe because they don't hold your private keys. Blockchain.info users have apparently had their accounst hacked though. I'd still prefer my own downloaded bitcoin wallet. You can start here if you don't know where to begin looking.

get rid of the ancient gold mining then. It did and is doing far more damage. Replace it with Bitcoin, then replace a few others things with Bitcoin and ta-da! Then hopefully solar energy becomes a thing and ta-da again! Then hopefully more innovation comes and ta-da again! If anyone is near sighted, sadly it is you.

Transaction fees - When the time comes, hopefully multitudes of more people use bitcoin and the price is multitudes higher in the future. Hopefully another incentive for miners are to protect their investments and their bitcoin holdings.

If you are referring to transaction fees, they aren't based on the amount of Bitcoin being sent. The fee to send $1 and $10,000,000 should be similar. Also, as someone mentioned earlier, 1 bitcoin is divisible down to the eighth decimal - a "satoshi" being the smallest unit (0.00000001 bitcoin)

In Bitcoin, blocks get solved and added to the end of the chain of blocks every ~10 minutes. Each individual block that is solved and added to the blockchain AFTER the block containing your transaction is 1 additional confirmation. Each additional confirmation your transaction gains, considerably decreases the "tamperability" (I may have made up that word) of the transaction. A 0 confirmation transaction runs the risk of being double-spent. 4 confirmations means 4 blocks have been solved and added to the blockchain after the block containing your transaction. Requiring 4 confirmations generally means the transaction has a significant value at risk. Why does adding a block increase security? It's hard to explain shortly - but for the most part it is because of POW (proof-of-work)

Yeah, not stupid ;) As mentioned by someone else. It depends on how much bitcoin and what you want to do with it. If its a small amount that you want very fast access to and maybe to buy stuff - generally that is fine. Your bitcoin will be somewhat considered at risk because it is online (although I have done this for years with small amount with no hack - a big factor is your computer environment, who uses the computer and computers on your network and what do they do on the computers). But if you are holding long term, I would keep the bitcoin OFFLINE - either on an offline pc, a hardware wallet or paper). A hardware wallet is a medium between cold storage and decently fast access to your bitcoin securely.

Those who want an increased blocksize want all people to do all their transactions DIRECTLY on the bitcoin blockchain and do so with super cheap transaction fees. (if these transactions are to be instant, i'm not sure what the solution would be for 0-confirmation double-spends). 
Those against blocksize increases (or especially large blocksize increases) argue the centralization effects it would have on the network due to bandwidth and storage capacity limits (more the bandwidth concerns though). Thus increasing single point of failures and increased susceptibility to corruption/manipulation. These people also ask, where do the blocksize increases stop? Eventually we will be transmitting GB blocks, storing TB blockchains and beyond. In result of this, nodes and miners would be in huge centralized centers. These people also tend to believe scaling will occur both at the protocol level but also on additonal protocol layers built on-top of bitcoin that utilize Bitcoin's security.
@_date: 2016-11-19 17:10:26
not just for these two layers specifically - but they are the two biggest that come to mind immediately...

I believe this is how it works:
Miners need to signal 95% support in order for segwit to activate. Signaling support for this softfork requires a solved block to include a version bit representative of v0.13.1's segwit in the header of the block. If 95% or more of the solved blocks within a re-target period (a re-target period consists of 2016 blocks) include the version bit representative of v0.13.1 in their header - 95% miner support is signaled. Bitcoin nodes will begin tracking which blocks have the segwit v0.13.1 version bit starting on November 15th.
After the 95% signal support period, segwit goes into a "locked-in" period for the duration of the proceeding re-target period. At the start of the next re-target period after the "locked-in" re-target period finishes segwit activates enabling miners to produce blocks with segwit transactions. A re-target period is 2016 blocks long or roughly 2 weeks.
Someone please confirm/deny/add to this! (as I am just learning too)

Just a hunch / feeling. I feel that although some may be of legitimate concern - the majority of the comments are posted with the pure intent of preventing approval. In other words, these entities (which may be the same people or colluding entities) have their one and only goal of preventing approval. Their comments provide nothing valuable (no warnings, improvements, advice, no balance in their arguments, credibility, facts, etc.) - just pure negativity. These people have something to lose from Bitcoin or hate it for some unknown reason.

I'll believe it when something of value comes out of it. Prove it, don't say it.

@_date: 2016-12-31 23:09:39
people make money off of it and that is why, imo
@_date: 2019-08-10 12:21:52
I 2nd this
@_date: 2016-12-23 14:48:27
I use trezor personally. You can import "WACTH ONLY" address into your bitcoin wallet on your phone such as mycelium.

Gold is shit compared to Bitcoin?

I would say it is more in reference to their incompetence in the past to some of their back-end coding decisions. To be honest, I've forgotten already, but it was a few different things - so maybe that is a good sign. I generally stay away from online web wallets unless it's a small amount for spending. I "THINK" (don't quote me) they are the only online web wallet that doesn't hold your private keys. So if they go bankrupt or the government shuts them down you can get your bitcoin still. All others to my knowledge hold your private key (such as coinbase and circle) so you lost 100% control of your bitcoin once you send bitcoin to them, also, completely fine if it's a very small amount for spending.
@_date: 2019-10-29 19:50:51
that's the spirit!
@_date: 2016-12-10 18:20:53
Maybe a small portion just to diversify and ease of use depending where bitcoin advancement is at when the time comes

@_date: 2017-01-11 15:17:31
exactly, every time the did this they caused the exact opposite..
@_date: 2016-11-19 01:49:42
Nice! What's a blockchain bank though?
@_date: 2019-10-30 04:01:29
I don't see any innovation yet. Gold is shit.
@_date: 2019-10-14 01:47:21
what if you don't sell the fork right when it comes out, then a year later you sell it but it's down 80%?
@_date: 2019-10-25 03:54:32
Don't use bitpay... period.
@_date: 2019-10-18 04:58:26

@_date: 2016-12-23 17:34:22
was just referring to your intention as in: 1) using the bitcoin often to buy/sell stuff or to hold larger amounts long term
@_date: 2019-10-19 17:02:52
And one is very new still and at a low price. So?
@_date: 2019-10-30 03:52:49
I feel sorry for your bags :( By the way, when is the completely new eth 2.0 system being released since all the developers know that eth 1.0 is already broken? Can't want for 3.0 after that.

Because it's been BEATEN over to death by other intelligent people. Research it yourself, but you won't. You can't convince people whose financial benefit will be crushed when the truth is faced. It's a shitcoin, deal with it. I'll wait to be proven wrong and only time will prove that.

quadrigacx.com is a nice site for Canadians. But please remember a bitcoin exchange is not a wallet - and as such do not use them as a wallet.

@_date: 2016-11-13 17:19:22
It's much less then that actually, considering many people have more than 1 bitcoin, for example some have: 2, 10, 100, 2000, 6000, 100 000 bitcoin, etc. Also, many have lost their bitcoin permanently: .1, .5, 1, 20, 400, 1400, 5000, etc.

You know you showed me absolutely nothing right? History only shows broken half-baked scam promises that could never work :( :(
I'd say get your head out of your ass, but instead, get your head out of your bags. True innovation does not scam it's users.

do they already own amazonbitcoin.com? It redirects to amazon.com. Article is a pump attempt for ethereum imo
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:34:54
I guess. There will be much bigger problems if this happens. Even this wouldn't necessarily kill Bitcoin

i think he's speaking about the tether holders running to convert to bitcoin (they can't cash it for $) if it turns out tether is some big problem.

Bitcoin (before segwit) could handle theoretical 7tps (transactions per second) with its 1mb blocksize. The fork was going to increase it to 2mb blocksize (after doing some math, is that much better to you?). It's going to get resolved with scaling on layers on top of Bitcoin. There will also be some scaling on the protocol level but only proven and tested solutions with consensus adoption - not some political, power grab move with a few ceos in a room signing an agreement (like 2x was). Bitcoin exchanges are all off-chain, so investments from big money is certainly possible as is.

Bitcoin forked coins are dividends (to me). There is only 1 coin that matters right now and that is Bitcoin. Can change in the future, but no one knows the future. I don't count on it changing though.

@_date: 2017-11-24 09:14:19
I honestly don't trust anything these clowns have been promoting for a while now. How could you after all the shenanigans they've been pulling? I see them as scammers willing to do anything for money.
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:51:12
couldn't they just say the opposite of what they think/want then?

"All that sounds like a day-dream that it is extremely unlikely to come true. The technology that made Bitcoin will crush it, provided that big banks and big governments don’t crush it ahead of technology, as was previously discussed here." lol...
@_date: 2017-11-03 01:21:38
oh, when importing your private key (when it's deemed safe by the community) into a supported 2x wallet - I suggest transferring your REAL bitcoin to a new address (thus a new private key) FIRST. Then transfer your old private key into the supported 2x wallet.

but hard on the wallet!
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:51:13
implement segwit
@_date: 2017-11-08 13:01:19
what's on the 16th?
@_date: 2017-11-02 06:51:37
Hold your Bitcoin in a wallet where you control the actual private key(s). When the fork occurs, don't send them until you do your research and it is deemed safe to do so. If there is no replay protection implemented by the ONLY 1 incompetent and malicious dev that is coding segwit2x - you could send your bitcoin when sending your 2x coins, resulting in a loss of real bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-16 14:00:49

You don't need to sign up to use a wallet you downloaded to your PC or phone for example. If you do, don't use them. As for PayPal I'm not sure, but I'm sure there are ways if you look hard enough! But it's less common due to chargeback risks.
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:49:21
It's complicated on different levels that I do not fully comprehend or necessarily want to. Greed is one of many factors.
@_date: 2019-02-12 03:05:36
Also, their donation address is still a legacy bitcoin address...
@_date: 2019-12-01 22:56:30
What Bilbo said. It means many users are trusting their bitcoin to be held on central exchanges. So it's more like an IOU. Dangerous for not only the specific user that has funds on the exchange, but also to the network globally if the exchange is hacked/seized/inside job, etc. (Although the effect globally, would be short term only).
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:38:11

@_date: 2019-12-15 05:59:44
Get a job. Start making money and slowly re-accumulate. You still have time, and it's never too late. There will most likely be many ups and downs to come in the next decades.
And don't gamble anymore and don't shitcoin. Just simple buy and hold.
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:32:37
yes. Nothing is guaranteed though.

Oh and welcome!
@_date: 2019-02-11 02:06:51
i think its to buy their futures probably...and not real bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-16 14:07:59
It "increases" the blocksize without actually increasing it. BUT all the large companies and people need to start using segwit to gain the benefits. Just recently, some large companies announced plans to implement segwit. I recently saw bitfinex (next week) and blockchain dot info (2018...) announce
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:09:35

No problem. Glad to help!

cause was +90% political and -10% technical. (which is why it is failing to gain consensus of all players in the ecosystem and is ultimately failing)
@_date: 2017-11-09 06:09:33

it already hit 5100
@_date: 2017-11-03 01:19:58
that's correct. As long as you have the private keys. After the fork, you can import the private key of your REAL bitcoin into a supported segwit2x wallet to gain access to your 2x coins. How will you know what you are buying from an exchange? The exchange should clearly define if you are buying real bitcoin or b2x. If they don't stay away from them until they clarify. Many exchanges have released an imperfect guideline of how they are handling the fork.
@_date: 2019-12-15 01:04:38

yup, technically anyone can fork. But do they have consensus is what matters. (among some other things)

interesting, thanks!
@_date: 2017-04-02 20:05:21
"crush" as in price going down? I think you're missing an important piece of information as some others have stated.
@_date: 2017-04-16 16:26:50
whenever I use bitcoin i usually re-buy it right away lol
@_date: 2016-02-22 00:20:26
i want it sooner
@_date: 2016-02-28 23:00:07
Bitcoin is the internet equivalent and "cryptocash", if you're referring to private blockchains are equivalent to the intranets.
@_date: 2016-02-14 01:08:38

I believe you, you're a Bitcoin expert!
@_date: 2016-02-25 03:01:35
I think partly because cutting it down to half (5 mins) might seem like a big jump but unless it can get to seconds or ms - the benefits aren't that great...
@_date: 2017-04-02 19:53:02
I do not wish that. I just didn't find that response offensive, that's all

yes please!

It has to start somewhere. Every new thing starts with low market cap, high volatility. It has to get to higher value and stability some how - just like anything else in history.
@_date: 2016-02-25 03:27:56
I know two well known ones are coinbase and bitpay. As to the best, i'm not sure.
@_date: 2016-02-06 19:12:47
Agreed - It's like saying back in the day that the internet is not good. Do they even understand what they are saying?? (Yes, I know the answer is no)
@_date: 2016-02-27 03:12:32
is there a good live youtube stream???
@_date: 2017-04-29 14:08:30
o.o now it's 8mb?
@_date: 2016-02-17 15:11:32
@_date: 2016-02-05 04:07:14
agreed, esp since it was above that about 1-2 weeks ago..but it's a start...

exactly, when people say this, they fail to realise that EVERYTHING has to start this way..
@_date: 2017-04-04 04:48:51
The one thing that caught my eye was the large Monero drawing..
@_date: 2016-02-05 03:37:33

all wrong, sorry
@_date: 2016-02-10 00:58:17
coinbase, circle or kraken seem safe for buying
@_date: 2017-04-21 13:33:02
i also read somewhere that they (jihan) are making some sort of litecoin group
@_date: 2016-02-19 02:48:55
I must agree, Coinbase while convenient has weird limits.. what country are you at
@_date: 2016-02-25 03:03:57
I think goodbtc is posting something of something someone else posted.
@_date: 2016-02-06 04:23:01
That's probable :/

fantastic job sir
@_date: 2016-02-04 03:14:59
Yes, I tried to use it for my brother and it kept getting cancelled time after time because I needed to pay extra for shipping but shipping would be free if I bought it myself in the amazon.ca. I eventually gave up
@_date: 2016-02-18 14:29:57
fantastic job arnhem team! :)
@_date: 2017-04-18 05:56:56

@_date: 2016-02-27 18:04:16
to be honsest I didn't bother reading the article. And I don't think so, Bitcoin started this all...it is the blockchain
@_date: 2016-02-04 04:53:24
@_date: 2016-02-27 18:38:05
then shortly after something will be better then tendermint. This isn't the point and if it was it was, this is a highly ineffecient system to keep completely replacing an entire ecosystem each time something better comes. Bitcoin is programming code that can change...
@_date: 2019-12-15 05:39:59
Ummmm, no
@_date: 2016-02-19 14:22:55
article is very confusing as to if they are using the bitcoin blockchain or not
@_date: 2016-02-06 19:38:14

it should die

and we'll never own a house :(

Edit: nvm i get it
@_date: 2016-02-19 02:35:10
I carried on with life and still hope to get a decent amount back.
@_date: 2019-12-06 07:29:33
Get those rocks the FUCK out of here
@_date: 2016-02-22 02:48:43
there's no CAD!
@_date: 2016-02-20 03:08:47
I don't fully understand the question. Could you re-phrase?
@_date: 2016-02-18 03:59:34
usually it's the opposite!
@_date: 2016-02-27 01:44:18
I would have said you're 7 years too late in discovering this and THE blockchain will cause 85% or more of the disruption
@_date: 2016-02-05 03:07:36
it just saves them money...
@_date: 2017-04-13 14:05:10
i'm pretty sure i saw him tweet yesterday about celebrating of litecoins recent progress on segwit activation...

Good job. Can't wait to retire as well
@_date: 2016-02-20 02:46:56
can't tell if they are trying to help bitcoin - I get the sense they could care less of bitcoin
@_date: 2016-02-21 01:17:57
@_date: 2017-04-08 01:03:59
same thing can be said of anything
@_date: 2016-02-17 05:09:02
wow - so not amazing!
@_date: 2016-02-14 18:13:14
I would say so, including my own transaction history..
@_date: 2017-04-25 00:39:08
Please do, asap
@_date: 2017-04-04 04:50:38
@_date: 2016-02-21 03:23:40
Also Note:
1) I reckon that there is a significant percentage of Bitcoin permenantly lost already and that percentage will increase with time.
2) Many people own more than once bitcoin (and some own A LOT of bitcoin)
So you are higher than "1 in 21 million"!

@_date: 2017-04-11 19:27:21
I consider any exchange insecure for medium to long term storage
@_date: 2016-09-04 14:21:38
not stupid because it's just another test net for the Bitcoin world to watch and learn from.
@_date: 2018-11-29 09:07:52
Yes, I will NEVER recommend this wallet ever, even if they do add SegWit. In fact, I will tell people to avoid the wallet. They have lost my trust.

so no sellers
@_date: 2017-09-04 23:39:56
if Bitcoin fell to 1250 (a value from 2013), I would say that isn't healthy. Generally agree with you though!
@_date: 2016-09-20 17:30:08
so innovative!
@_date: 2018-02-09 03:01:21

no one predicts bitcoin
@_date: 2017-09-02 07:23:24
it's math, actually
@_date: 2017-09-02 06:57:42
most likely some large miner in cahoots with some "other" people...
@_date: 2017-09-09 14:04:20
1 ban not good enough, must do 2 in a row!
@_date: 2018-03-08 14:20:28
They caused 2011 crash too

@_date: 2017-09-14 13:50:59
@_date: 2017-09-25 23:03:19
a blockchain or thousands of different ones?
@_date: 2017-09-01 12:04:06
nah. 1 will
@_date: 2018-02-11 20:46:45
I tried educating some family. One hates it (he hates most things though) and the other ones are buying alts cause they feel they missed the boat with Bitcoin. It's sad.
@_date: 2017-09-02 16:35:20

@_date: 2017-10-14 13:00:21
waiting for its over 9000
@_date: 2017-10-05 18:51:03
means get as many bitcoin as you can to get more future dividends?
@_date: 2017-10-08 15:25:49
not a very comprehensive list
@_date: 2017-09-14 14:04:39
so in other words they want to try to influence the market in the future still...more bans later left over until they exhaust EVERY ban that they can...

let's not even give it that much success
@_date: 2017-09-21 14:10:43
didnt the ban already happen?
@_date: 2017-09-24 15:29:57
it is still "there" and will forever exist. Just no one will have access to it and thus not in circulation.
@_date: 2018-02-08 04:08:40
@_date: 2017-09-16 01:25:38

I like that price (and both Richard &amp; Trace), but I doubt we get there that fast. I'm open to being proven wrong though :p
@_date: 2017-09-20 08:55:33
i'm selling for 1 000 000 bcash
@_date: 2017-09-23 20:00:43
@_date: 2017-09-01 13:56:49
I also, respectfully disagree
@_date: 2018-02-11 20:40:43
Spread the word and educate others now!

@_date: 2017-09-26 14:14:59

@_date: 2017-09-20 09:04:24
can I call a rock a laptop?
@_date: 2017-09-23 01:07:00

@_date: 2017-09-20 08:56:18

What about the exchanges such as coinbase that were not doing batching and had not implemented segwit yet?
@_date: 2017-09-03 14:52:43
hold and buy
@_date: 2017-10-13 01:33:14
@_date: 2017-10-09 13:19:49
yes,you'll want as many bitcoin as you can get for the upcoming dividends
@_date: 2017-09-29 08:42:05
you are doomed

If they want to become the next gox maybe. I'm not saying it isn't possible but that would be quite risky, IMO.
@_date: 2017-10-19 06:30:45
anyone got a link to the clip?
@_date: 2017-10-15 13:26:45
No problem. It depends on the time frame and the value you are purchasing each time. If you're buying like $30 dollars every week or something like that, you can probably wait to transfer off end of each month. Although even if you transferred off the exchange 4 times per month I don't think it will add to that much? Less than $4 total should be?
@_date: 2017-10-12 06:37:55
@_date: 2017-10-24 00:39:12

you don't, ever...
@_date: 2017-10-15 03:29:24
I suggest not keep any amount to store on an exchange. They are not wallets. Use a wallet where you and you only control the private keys.

@_date: 2018-02-12 04:28:49
setup a dummy wallet and just give them that.

Hi Greg, yup! But I ended up just going into the peer tab and just manually blocking all the "52.xxx.xxx...." IPs. Thank you!

Conclusion of the fiat money experiment: it has failed us many times over and as a whole is a failure. But all is not lost, we learned many important lessons and will carry those lessons with us when building the new system.
@_date: 2015-11-29 23:34:06

Aw man I'm sorry :(
@_date: 2017-05-01 03:56:12
Unfortunately, just months ago my IT department spoke about Bitcoin and they were extremely uneducated and misinformed about it. It saddened me that these technical people don't even understand the importance of Bitcoin to the slightest degree. Lots of tech people are still highly uneducated of Bitcoin and therefore cynical about it (in my experience with average people). There are a number of them that do have a higher understanding and openness to Bitcoin though. It will be interesting what their perspective of it is when/if Bitcoin is at 5-10k each.
@_date: 2017-05-31 01:34:10

That was obvious..(to me at least)
@_date: 2017-05-30 01:56:40
yes (imo) - only invest what you can afford to lose please and hold long term! and secure your stuff properly!
@_date: 2017-05-13 21:55:31

@_date: 2016-05-11 04:48:57
those who THINK private blockchains are worth - are the ones with endless money supply...so what's your point
@_date: 2016-05-07 14:05:24
yes, I agree and who are those people? And is there a way around this on the Bitcoin blockchain..?
@_date: 2016-05-07 18:57:29
Bitcoin is the future. Deal with it
@_date: 2016-05-31 07:33:03

i'm just "meh"

I like it!
@_date: 2016-05-11 05:41:23
no, im saying they have lots of money...
@_date: 2017-05-22 14:14:18
no, but the coin doing $10 to 175 is and the other ones with similar or even higher % increases in very short period

And it was true at that time..and you don't need to worry about me ;)
@_date: 2016-05-21 12:57:07
Let me guess, eth
@_date: 2016-10-22 23:12:00
i doubt it
@_date: 2016-05-28 20:22:52
so, what is this? death  or something?
@_date: 2017-05-27 13:00:55
now that's something to see!
@_date: 2016-05-28 22:25:03
Ironically, this video played right after...hope it's not a sign
@_date: 2016-05-31 06:25:33
is all this data being put to good use by the appropriate people?
@_date: 2016-05-31 01:20:02
@_date: 2016-05-29 21:01:51
I wonder why they felt the need to remove Bitcoin in their twitter
@_date: 2016-05-11 02:52:57
these private blockchains are SOOOOOOO innovative. They excite me a lot! They're going to make my life SO much better, safer and easier. RIGHT?!?!?!

Uh huh
@_date: 2016-05-01 13:11:38
just don't do another gox...
@_date: 2016-05-29 21:08:27
i want to...ban them.....
@_date: 2017-05-19 05:00:56
I wasn't disagreeing with a price rise...I was mocking the $40 000 USD per bitcoin "SOON"
@_date: 2017-05-11 06:05:50
these old white men remind me of something...something about history..
@_date: 2016-05-14 14:15:30
NEVER say NEVER
@_date: 2016-05-02 06:25:28
~6 years
@_date: 2016-05-29 21:04:18
they're too busy focusing on eth
@_date: 2016-05-28 13:44:25
@_date: 2016-05-15 20:41:29
do i sense sarcasm?
@_date: 2017-05-10 15:12:42
I haven't been excited either
@_date: 2016-05-29 21:02:27
this is nothing
@_date: 2017-05-22 05:17:27
that's not usually how it works..but I wish it was!
@_date: 2017-05-21 14:22:32
nope, technically it hasn't even doubled from the previous highest price back in dec 2013 - so it took 4 years to almost double.
But if you don't want to go that route, it reached just over 1000 at the end of dec 2016 / jan 1st 2017 for the 2nd time in bitcoin history.
@_date: 2016-05-15 18:40:47
@_date: 2016-05-18 04:38:00
how can it be factored in advance when the supply hasn't been cut in half yet....less supply is offered AFTER the halving. BEFORE the halving the supply is the same as it was the last 3.X years. How can a halving of the supply be factored in before it has even begun.....
@_date: 2017-05-17 03:53:06
i think they do
@_date: 2016-05-22 14:53:10
I must say this is revolutionary and will help billions in around the world.
@_date: 2017-05-05 07:42:30
I agree :/ ....everywhere I go those annoying shits are there..
@_date: 2016-05-05 03:11:15
I will be skeptical even with proof
@_date: 2016-05-01 13:10:24
Yeah, the Bitcoin one can
@_date: 2016-05-18 14:34:31
after the halving, every 10 minutes the amount of new bitcoin mined/created is cut in half. Doesn't that mean the supply every 10 minutes is cut in half?
@_date: 2017-05-13 06:47:09
I found the video inaccurate
@_date: 2017-05-25 13:58:27
enormous progress...in what exactly...? Exponential price increase in a very short period of time?
@_date: 2016-05-07 13:52:10
and Bitcoin brings blockchain to the people
@_date: 2017-05-27 23:55:33
@_date: 2017-07-25 00:51:01
@_date: 2016-05-07 13:36:53
that's a good question, haha...who wouldn't want to use this system...hmmm...

what's to stop another one replacing that one in 5 years? then what is stopping another one from taking over in another 8 years? then what is stopping another taking over in another 10 years? See where i'm going with this? It would be an endless zero sum game - and might I add, pointless...

What's stopping an alt coin from taking over? Network effect. I'm not starting over again and again. Probably 99% of alt coins out there scale no better than bitcoin or much worse and are not tested. On top of that they aren't going to get far since adoption will bring the same politics. There are many more reasons as well. There's always going to be a new coin that claims to be better, are we going to change coins every time? Also, taking alot of effort and time to make changes at the protocol level is a feature. Too easy to sway a global system is bad. I do however think we should implement segwit sooner than later..just my humble opinion.

ironically, i just spent the whole day trying to buy a small amount of bitcoin (but large enough to set alarms off in their banking system). Account got blocked 3 times plus reached my low limit max. Did the transfer 7am, finally got to finish buying at 3pm. Yay for our super banking system!

didn't a lot of them sell their bitcoin for fiat hence why they had a large price difference from the global btc price. (it was much less). Also, why would allowing bitcoin withdrawls (the ability to get your bitcoins out) make them suddenly sell their bitcoin?

Do you think it was coinbase that caused the problem? It must be - because the transactions were pending on coinbase's side and he didn't recive anything at that time.

likey not to happen because of miners? if this happened it would probably be much later in the future and would be direly required for the survival of bitcoin so they may not have a choice. these miners also probably made a ton of money and would recoup

in my humble opinion - I disagree. I don't think the bitfinex few hour maintenance and something unrelated to Bitcoin was reasonable for a price drop. It reaveals how hyper-sensitive this market is (or how big fish easily game)

something to do with hard fork
@_date: 2016-07-07 04:31:03
to be honest it's done this 3-5 times already. Each time being an instant $50 dollar drop then back up to normal - maybe this time is different? Then there was the larger drop during the DAO fiascal. How soon we forget..that or you don't pay attention.
@_date: 2016-07-23 13:33:10

Also, I forgot to add: 1mb cap was meant to protect against "spam" transactions - the definition of "spam" varies. For example: are tons of small transactions that pay a txn fee spam? Is using the Bitcoin blockchain for database purposes spam?
@_date: 2016-07-23 13:00:49
Thanks everyone!, yeah i can't f igure out if it was coinbase or his wallet that caused the problem (or maybe both?). I never had problem with coinbase hot wallet for spending online before. I'll try my mycelium wallet next time. I guess we can say my first experiment went  bad ;) But hoping the next one will be better after learning some things myself from this experience (like NEVER scan a QR code more than once even if you dont think it worked and ill try myecelium next time)
@_date: 2016-07-02 19:08:06
@_date: 2016-07-23 13:18:59
Yeah his wallet definetely did not show any of the three unconfirmed txns at that time (must of waited 10 mins in total).
Didn't recognize the wallet symbol he was using - but i know for sure it def was not breadwallet.
@_date: 2018-12-11 14:47:07
ToSHIBA also solo created dogecoin
@_date: 2016-07-23 13:29:33
yeah or use some more professional method. I'm still not sure which side caused the problem (maybe both?). Ill use myecelium next time.
@_date: 2016-07-23 13:15:37
thanks for the tips! I'll try my myecelium next time.
I only had 32 dollars in the hot wallet thankfully

you can assume some dips tomorrow, lol..
@_date: 2016-07-23 13:58:08
agreed, maybe you dont even need to open your wallet. Bump my phone and the default wallet automatically pays and asks to confirm payment once. That'd be nice!

@_date: 2017-06-05 01:58:15
you didn't leave us a story, lol
@_date: 2016-07-09 05:39:12
i think part of the worry was part bandwidth and part blockchain size. With increased blocksize comes a larger blockchain, which means the blockchain could get so big in size that not everyone can run a full bitcoin core node. This means large scale servers, for example, will only be able to run bitcoin core full nodes  leaving average joe behind - thus resulting in less decentralization.
Also, I forgot to add: 1mb cap was meant to protect against "spam" transactions - people have varying definitions of what "spam" is. For example: are tons of small transactions that pay a txn fee spam? Is using the Bitcoin blockchain for database purposes spam?

just pumpers who bought. if i bought eth id pump it too lol
@_date: 2016-07-09 13:03:24
Certainly not yet - I hope. Blockchain is 50-65 GB in total size as far as I know. We're talking about full bitcoin core nodes not miners, btw
@_date: 2016-05-24 02:16:59
@_date: 2016-07-02 14:05:26
I'm under the impression average joe won't use Bitcoin every day until the price is much higher.
@_date: 2017-06-11 01:10:59
this is a weird bubble then...

@_date: 2016-07-23 13:09:24
yeah I know. I'll use myecelium next time. I should never have scanned the qr code again after. Just didn't get what was going on (and I would consider myself tech savvy). About the price, yeah i was kind of annoyed he said that - I wanted to say well it's back to 850-900 CAD again. (I live in canada) He must not have checked price in months.

lol, this train ain't stopping for over a decade
@_date: 2017-06-09 02:46:23
can this price rise be considered "exponential" ? It was ~$1250, in 2013 for a day or two...so it took that many years for this increase
@_date: 2017-06-02 03:16:57
you deposited 23000 cad to buy bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-07-24 02:41:03
Ah that makes sense
@_date: 2017-06-11 16:40:21
@_date: 2017-06-10 18:07:03
ethereum has to scale too..
@_date: 2017-06-02 06:36:03
then name one person that used that "competitor" coin to buy the merchandise (but I do agree we need segwit asap)

they're not giving it back for free and if you do bitcoin right you can never lose your bitcoin from hack or losing your device, etc.
@_date: 2016-07-07 02:19:15
sorry for your loss
@_date: 2017-06-18 14:56:33
Yeah, but don't people use those for general purpose desktop computers and gaming computers as well? ASICs only have one very specific purpose. Everyday people / companies aren't buying ASICs for their normal computers and gaming machines.

Nope, you are correct. These are just concerns that people had (not really my concerns). For example, miners in China are behind the great firewall and have limitations. But you are right, storage is getting cheaper and larger (and even faster). Also, optimisations WILL be made both at protocol level and with new layers on top of the protocol. Some that come to mind are weak/thin blocks, compact blocks, extreme thin blocks, FIBRE relay network and Falcon relay network, segregated witness, pruning etc.

that's right!
@_date: 2016-07-23 21:06:04
Saw that today too..
@_date: 2016-07-30 02:27:55
me too - if there is a convenient way to do this I will do it.
@_date: 2017-06-13 01:55:33
that perfectly explains ethereum...
@_date: 2017-06-26 00:06:34
don't worry - you're not the only one. Some even had thousands maybe even 10,000 bitcoins and lost them.
@_date: 2016-07-23 13:20:34
I kind of agree - if you are accepting bitcoin it should be a bit more proper/professional. not sure how we get there though.
@_date: 2017-06-19 04:10:10
@_date: 2017-06-26 01:06:33
for what?
@_date: 2017-06-20 00:31:25
@_date: 2017-06-12 02:19:06
well put
@_date: 2017-06-02 06:37:53
@_date: 2016-07-09 23:04:20
see you again in 2020!
@_date: 2017-06-15 15:08:41
nah, not just you
@_date: 2017-06-18 02:28:34
nvidia and amd getting in - would that be a solution? competitive prices and availability of stock to general public
@_date: 2016-05-13 14:30:31
If this private blockchain requires $200 million plus (and that is just NOW) then this is just another tick for why the public blockchain is far superior
@_date: 2017-06-17 16:12:22
@_date: 2017-06-17 16:28:01
this is a weird bubble...
@_date: 2017-06-19 01:25:14
@_date: 2017-06-07 06:32:03
@_date: 2016-07-08 02:20:11
don't forget cavirtex!
@_date: 2017-06-20 00:50:22
you mean like it just recently did??
@_date: 2017-06-17 03:41:45
oh my...
@_date: 2017-06-14 15:04:20
hell no
@_date: 2017-06-23 07:04:09
@_date: 2017-06-04 20:26:22
@_date: 2017-06-02 15:08:31
Can whine all we want. We need to work towards the future
@_date: 2017-06-18 17:16:56
getting sick of china all together..
@_date: 2016-07-07 02:22:01
it'll go up soon enough..
@_date: 2017-06-06 07:07:02
AMD, make bitcoin asics...ill buy probably
@_date: 2019-05-26 03:12:45
Hodl and accumulate
@_date: 2016-07-28 15:06:53
how smokecoin works?
@_date: 2017-06-30 13:29:55
@_date: 2016-07-09 05:40:11
other way around ;) but honestly goes both ways
@_date: 2017-06-08 02:21:58
yup, Bitcoin is shit that is in a bubble. Ethereum, dash and all other alts that are up 100s / 1000s of % in two months or so are not! Please believe me!
@_date: 2017-06-10 01:40:39
oh well..some lose, some win
@_date: 2016-07-28 15:08:35
if this is not done on the bitcoin blockchain can this "database" not be manipulated and corrupted if needed?
@_date: 2017-06-21 01:30:03
@_date: 2017-06-25 00:28:44
most are test beds for Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-06-20 00:33:22
@_date: 2017-06-04 22:05:17
No one knows. If it does, it "should" recover eventually. If you are going to hold long term, it probably doesn't matter when you buy. Every situation you make will have a risk. Don't day trade!
@_date: 2017-06-04 20:27:17
no, bitcoin is not a company. No one controls or owns Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-11 02:10:24
What about 20% in one day? Like one coin did today.
@_date: 2018-12-26 16:23:42
Ew, eth....
@_date: 2017-06-09 02:04:44
yes, he caused the price to go down...
@_date: 2017-09-02 07:03:04
they are miners, miners get transactions fees as part of the block reward. Just a theory..
