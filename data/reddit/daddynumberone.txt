I would tend to think that bitcoin would be looked at as more of a safe haven.  The various financial asset classes - stocks, bonds, REITs, etc. are considered to be only mildly correlated and so people spread their money between them for diversification.  The problem is that in a panic correlation goes to 1.  But I do not think that will apply to btc.  My hunch is that people will sell, putting money in cash, and then immediately look for a way to earn something somewhere.  Gold and btc will benefit.
That is my guess, anyway.  Since it has never happened in reality, it is a little hard to say.
@_date: 2014-01-07 21:33:01
In economic terms, there is a difference between "demand" and "quantity demanded" and likewise for supply.  "Demand" (I will stop using quotes now that you unterstand I am referring to the more rigorous definitions used by economist) is a line that reflects the tradeoff between price and quantity demanded.  That line is fixed in place as long as the factors that make up demand do not change.
When you say that the market runs out of new buyers, that is a vague thing to say.  If in fact nobody wants to buy btc anymore, then the value will immediately go to zero.  But to say that you can sum up the amount of money the market is willing to spend on btc and that when the money is spent there is no more money to be spent is not accurate.  Becuase if people want to spend money on btc, then demand has not gone to zero, so price will not go to zero.  Price may fall, but as price falls people who did not want btc at a higher price may want btc at a lower price.
In a nut shell, your economics doesn't work.  Barring a disaster which in fact results in nobody wanting bitcoins at all, then the price may fall, but it will not hit a wall of zero demand like you describe above.

I like the straw man assumption that a guy sitting on millions of dollars worth of bitcoins is so fucking stupid that he is going to choose market sale for the whole pile at once, and hit enter regardless of the effect.  
Try to pay attention: if all of the owners of homes in your town put them all on the market at the same time, the price would fall by 80%. If all of the car owners in your town put them up for sale at the same time, they would have a sales value of $200 each.  If the Louvre threw open its doors and sold all of the art on the walls and in the vaults at the same time, the price of Picassos etc. would tank.
Do you see a pattern here?  And are you aware that this doesn't actually happen in the real world?

It is also bad for the entire portion of the economy that feeds off of the fear of inflation, i.e. the "finance" industry.  The threat that inflation will reduce the value of the money under their pillow to nothing forces people into "investing" where they can be systematically raped.

What risks?  People conflate price movement with risk. That is not risk in my opinion.
What the teeth gnashers consider risks I do not.  I see almost no risk at this price. If someone is trading in and out, they are foolish and will likely lose money. That is not a risk of bitcoins. That is doing something counterproductive.
People say "don't invest more..blah blah". Their assumption is that because they say it can go to zero, it can go to zero.  That is false.

There are many industries that will be reborn because of the cost savings of bitcoin transactions.  Many businesses operate on a couple percent profit margin.  Cutting credit card transaction costs by 50% to 99% could double profits, thereby doubling the value of the business/stock.

What you want is an authoritarian body to confiscate people's money as a punishment for not donating fees to the finance industry.  You support fascism.
Inflation is theft.  Inflation is a tax on money.  Every year, your government really really wants to steal 3% of all of your money.  It does this by causing inflation. And it has convinced people like you that this is GOOD. That it is necessary.

So your argument is that people should only ever invest in any asset an amount that is so trivial that if it were to vanish instantly they would not bat an eye?  That is stupid advise.  It means the average person will never invest more than maybe $200 in anything.
Do you honestly think there is a single successful person out there who never risked something big?  Something they couldn't "afford" to lose?  But they thought they were right, and then they were right.

It is not the job of some bureaucrat to invest confiscated bitcoins, so the Fed thing makes no sense.
The top hackers have been looking for years, and found nothing.  Which gives me great confidence that if there is a problem it will be minor and fixable.
The electricity use of bitcoins will never be more than a tiny fraction of the Trillions of dollars the US has pissed to keep criminal banks running for no reason at all.  Furthermore, fracking is starting to destroy the groundwater throughout the US, and nobody gives a damn, so this won't matter either.

Don't bother. You can waste your life trying to convince people of things.  I have learned that people hate to learn.

This is a guess, but I would guess that the % of people who use bitcoins to evade taxes will be about the same as the % of people who use cash to evade taxes.  Same for the more elaborate methods you outlined above.
For years people would spend money on credit cards issued on foreign banks.  Money would never show up in a US account, yet these people could live large w/o carrying a wad of cash like a drug dealer.  I think that has been stopped to some extent.

Why, I have an actual degree in economics.  MA from a University of California school.  It's not a PhD, but it's good enough to give me a little insight.
I have noticed that most posters here know nothing about economics, nor do they want to know anything about economics.
Economics is a soft science, and Macroeconomics is barely a science at all.  When top practicioners cannot even agree on the sign of the output ( + or - ) for a given input, that is not a science that is worth discussing.
So, given that I consider Macro to be below voodoo and phrenology wrt its ability to predict the future, what info are you looking for?

I don't think they will charge "extra" for credit cards.  They will leave that fee built into the price as it is now.  But they might give a discount for cash / bitcoins.  I've seen numerous gas stations that charge extra for credit now.
Wait a minute...which gas station chain is it that quotes the debit card price, and then adds a shitload of money on for credit cards?  They need bitcoins.

You know why?  In addition to the fact that they need to learn all this shit from scratch?  The reason is that as soon as you open this can of worms, as soon as you want to be secure, you realize that it is never totally attainable.
I used to use Windows and now i use Linux.  Here is what it looks like to switch:
- OK, windows sucks, I'm switching to Linux;
- Which distro should I use? (first, what is a distro?) Ubuntu? Mint? Debian? Wait is Mint the same as Ubuntu? Wait, there is a specific pared down version of Linux especially for security?  Will any of my peripherals, which I don't want to spend $1000 replacing, work on that? How would I even figure that out?  Hmm, my printer has built in wireless - is that secure?
- (dozens of hours of research later)OK, I am going to install xyzLinux.  Where do I buy that software? Oh, I need to make a Live Disk. But I don't want to run it live, I want to install it....
- OK, Linux is up and running.  It is fast and cool.  Let's get all the bitcoin shit installed. Hmmm, apparently it is possible for there to be fake spyware versions of bitcoin programs?  Shit, so much for getting this done before lunch.
-OK, I need to check the PGP signature.  How the fuck do I do that?  Install abc.  Go the Terminal and enter... Great now I need to learn that Windows looking command line shit just to see if I have downloaded a fake copy.
- Days of spare time later - I have downloaded the real file (something that used to take me one minute).  But wait, did it download properly?  If not, my billion Satoshis may vanish.  OH, I only need to check the SHA256. 
What the fuck is that?  Check it against what?  How?  How do I know that hash is the right hash and hasn't been hacked by miscreants?
I REALLY don't think you computer professionals understand how much effort it takes a non-computer professional to become conversant in all this shit.

except that people have to buy bitcoins to spend bitcoins.  And there is a certain amount of bitcoins / unit of time required in the system to facilitate a transaction.

You outlined the problem and the opportunity.  Figure out how to get bitcoins into the hands of your peers.  Figure out how to buy bitcoins yourself, and then sell them to your friends, with maybe a little profit built in for your trouble.

Excellent point.  The people who cry the loudest about not paying taxes in the US (already the lowest taxed civilized country on earth) have rarely gone to any country that already has their utopian tax schemes in place.  That is because their utopian tax schemes destroy countries.

No, it's not complicated. Deflation is not bad for "the economy". Deflation is bad for politicians who can no longer use inflation (an invisible tax on money) to decrease government debts, and so must actually pay their bills.  Deflation is bad for all of the scammy parts of the financial industry, because without inflation, people can just put money under their pillows rather than being forced to hand it over to the finance industry where it gets taxed and fee-ed away.

Do you think BTC are real and valid and long term? If so, why are you asking this question? You think you are going to time little jumps and dips? Why? If it is really going to work, the price in 10 years will be between $1000 and $10,000 per btc. 
If you don't think it will work, then sell.
@_date: 2012-08-16 17:58:53
I find it shocking that people buy btc without any concept of why they are doing it. What is btc worth? Answer that and you will answer your bubble question.
No flaws have been found in the underlying code yet, which means it is pretty damn sound considering the number of hackers who must be trying. Given that, what is btc worth?
The maximum number of btc ever will be 21 million. How much money will the people of the world want to invest in btc over and above that which is required for transactions?
If the answer is $2 billion dollars, then btc will be worth at least $100 each.  For perspective, Americans spend $6 billion per year on toilet paper. The online porn business is worth something like $5 billion per year.  If people want to hold $21 billion worth of btc investments, which is nothing for the entire world, then btc will be worth $1000 each.
Is this a bubble?  Who cares?

Agree, except I would point out that short term price fluctuations do not symbolize a rise or a fall of btc, but only the price of btc.  BTC has gone in one direction, and that is UP. It is used by more people and businesses in more transactions, and that is how its success will be measured. And as it gets more successful as measured this way, its price will follow.

First, BTC is not kind of like stocks. Stocks are highly regulated financial securities.  BTC are not financial securities in any way.  They are digital commodities, like a digital version of gold.
On what grounds would BTC be declared illegal outside of crackpot shitholes like North Korea? Buying and selling with BTC is really a barter transaction. BTC is not considered to be money or a financial instrument by any government.  So "buying" something with BTC is really trading BTC for another item.
Barter transactions are not illegal. They may be taxable, but they are not illegal.

Three possibilities:

2. Haters are genuine but wrong.
3. Haters think it might be big, but don't have the guts to put their money where their mouths are, and they hate the idea of other people making money while they sit on the sidelines. i.e. they are not btc haters, but player haters.
In my opinion, the arguments against btc make no sense, and seem to come from ignorance.

The government is not innovative, and will not create a digital currency as mentioned below.  It took the US decades to add color to the currency to help defeat counterfeiters.  Not innovative.
Bitcoins are relatively anonymous.  Much more so than any other payment method besides cash, which requires you to meet the person you are paying.  Cash is useless on the internet.
Cash is also useless if your national currency sucks and your government sucks.  The Argentine currency blows up on a regular basis because it is run by criminals.  The last time inflation went nuts people bought USD.  The govt. banned USD bank accounts and tried to control exchanges into USD.  So people who had USD or Euros put them into safe deposit boxes.  The government broke into the safe deposit boxes.  So people kept foreign currency under their mattress.
People in countries like Argentina will flock to btc when it hits the radar and becomes usable by normal people.
The doom and gloom in the article above is not useful because it is too vague.  I understand the attitude, but it is not useful.
@_date: 2012-11-27 15:29:35
You are opposed to btc being traded on the open market?  Should someone set the price?  How can you be opposed to price changes in the open market?
I think bubbles are good.  The only people who got burned are the ones who bought high and sold low.  If you bought high and still hold them, you haven't been burned.
I would guess that a lot of the money for btc startups has come from people who made millions when the price went from 1 cent to 3000 cents.  Without that bubble, many of the people here would never have heard of Bitcoins.  If it pops to $80 now, interest by investors will spike, and therefore interest by businesses will spike.  And that will make btc more widely accepted.
@_date: 2012-08-27 13:47:03
1 - btc is a digital commodity, not a currency, and not a security. People don't get this.
2 - no holes in the system so far, which means the number of btc cannot be manipulated by governments or companies
3 - need for improvements in ease of use and security, i.e. theft protection and privacy

Furthermore, if the govt. wanted to call it a currency so it could regulate it, BTC would instantly get so much attention and credibility that it would likely go to $10,000 per btc.

Sure - I wired some money from a US Bank account which belongs to an LLC.  I did this because I remembered how long the Dwolla process took before.  I thought the wire would be faster, and the amount was well below the amounts that Mt.Gox said would trigger the money laundering BS.  They lied.  After the money was wired, they asked for verification.
The question is simple: this is not a "corporate" account, it is for an LLC.  What do they need?  Corporate account is the only option they give other than individual.
The whole thing seems ridiculous considering that I had to prove who I was to the bank to open the account in the United States, which Mt.Gox should realize.

Critical mass. Do an article search.  A year ago there were almost zero per month. Now there are new articles each day.  That introduces new people, and keeps the initiated involved.
Also, new services. People have put real money and real effort into btc in the last 1+ years. More businesses accept them.  They are easier to use, etc.
Coming inflection points will be when a really simple wallet is created, and when a major retailer starts accepting them. These will happen. When Amazon or Zappos or whoever starts including "We accept Bitcoins" in their ads, it will go nuts.

If you are mining you need to drop the money for the equipment, and you need to pay for electricity.  I have not done that math, but lots of other people have.  If you look at the way markets work, my guess is that you will barely make more than your electric cost, plus a tiny rate of return on your investment. If returns were big, the people who are already doing it would use their returns to buy more equipment. That would push returns down until no new people entered the market.
And in fact, because a lot of people don't do the math, my guess would be that people keep entering the mining business long after profits are gone.

In well over a decade of digesting as much info as possible about bubbles and markets, that was one of the most concise and accurate depictions of reality I have seen. I could go on for hours on this subject (BS Finance, MA Economics), but this is the root of it, and most people have no idea that this is how the big markets like real estate work.
I started preaching the R/E bubble to anyone who would listen in Feb 2004. I saved myself and a couple friends many hundreds of thousands, but most people never understood what was going on. And not a journalist on earth "got it" until well after the bubble burst, with the exception of The Economist, which started talking r/e bubbles in roughly 2001 or 2002.
When you see "journalists" or "writers" or "experts" criticize BTC, remember that these are the people who did not see the housing bubble until after it popped, and it was arguably the largest real estate bubble in the history of the world.

BTC are not strictly a currency.  They are more of a very cheap and easy to trade commodity.  And as a commodity, think digital gold, it will be invested in.  "Hoarding" is the negative term used for investing.  
If BTC continue to be used, and increase in popularity as a currency, the value will go up.  Given that the value will go up (again, if they continue to be used) then people will invest in them.  And every single commodity investment ever has had bubbles.  Tulips, gold, silver, wheat, real estate, oil, bitcoins.  From 1864 to 1874 (yes 1800s) oil fell 80% in value.  Was oil dead?  From 1980 to 1985 oil fell 70%.  Was it dead then?
If BTC continue to grow in popularity, the price will soar, and there will be many more bubbles.

Hedge funds will jump in with 100% certainty.  Why?  Because their fee structure dictates that the more risk a manager assumes, the more money that manager will earn.
Hedge fund managers get paid a % of the annual gains.  If they lose money, they just shut the doors and start a new fund.  If they make money, the managers get rich.  Managers like to get rich - it is why hedge funds exist.

Excellent post.  Given these analyses, my guesstimate is 500,000.  I go lighter than the potential max because with something like this, many people who download never use.
This is great news.  It means a 100 fold increase in users worldwide is not only attainable, but likely given no technical or regulatory bombs.  That would be 50M users worldwide, well adopted but far from saturated.  That would probably be 10 fold higher.
My guess is that a 100 fold increase in users would result in a more than 100 fold increase in price, just because the move to that size user base would indicate safety.  And the perceived decrease in risk would cause people to leave more in btc.

this has been happening once or twice per week, but it only goes back in value by a couple days.  If you wait for the next fall, it might only fall back to a price that is much higher than the current price.
There are lots of posts on here by people who were pissed that the price rose to $15, and they were hoping it would fall back to $10 so they could buy.  They probably missed the last $120 rise.

Totally agree.  2 years ago, I first decided that bitcoins were not a scam or a ponzi scheme.  After that I came up with 2 things that could derail bicoins.  They were 1) a fundamental unfixable glitch, and 2) government interference.  To my mind, the threat of a glitch has just become more remote, and that is good.
Every month some big website, whether it be a national bank, a giant online retailer, or a government website gets hacked or crashes.  Nobody abandons online banking or online shopping because of this.  Bitcoins have just hit their biggest problem in a couple years and shrugged it off not in days, but in hours.  Good Job!

He rolled that into a couple small strip malls and ended up making over $800k all tolled.  I expect all of these people to be shaking their heads and saying that there is no way you should have made so much money.  The bottom line is that if you are sure about something, then commit.

People are theives or not.  This guy was a theif.  He has done it before and will do it again.  I would recommend meeting people in the parking lot and snapping a pic of his licence plate before the transaction.  Or tell him you want a pic of his face before transferring the btc.  Since he is a theif, he sure as hell doesn't want anyone to have a pic of his face or plates.  So he will either back out (good riddance - the headphones were stolen anyway), or he will not cause trouble.
The guy will use the same language in future ads.  Search for the exact text he used in the bitcoin part.  Next time you see him selling stolen stuff on Craigslist, fuck with him.  Tell the cops he is selling stolen stuff.  That might get their attention to do a sting.

Also, the headlines might lead one to believe that RSA encryption is a fraud, and that will surely be brought up by haters. So it is good to have read this article, because it is not RSA encryption but a company called RSA that is a fraud.
So it is related to Bitcoin.

A long time ago people picked up chunks of gold off of the ground. Then it became harder to find, so the price went up.  And here we are 10,000 years later, and gold is still available.  The amount mined is much less than the amount traded, which means there are always people buying, and correspondingly people selling.  As it has been with gold, so it shall be with bitcoins.  When your grandchildren want to buy some bitcoins, my grandchildren may want to sell some bitcoins, because across millions of people, there are many different needs.

There is a difference between scepticism (good) and closed minded ignorance (bad).  The price will fall.  And then it will go back up.  Learn some math.  BTC adoption can still go up by something like 1000 fold.  But you don't think that will drive the price up, because when the price was $10 you were pissed that you missed $5, so now you're a troll.

"I should be able...blah blah blah".  Yes, bitcoins are still a pain in the ass.  They always have been, but they are becoming less so.  That is why the price is going up.

A timer is someone who thinks they know when the market is going to go up and when it is going to go down.  Because they think they know that "this is a bubble", or "we just broke through a resistance point", or other timer nonsense, they are always waiting for that dip in price so they can buy more than they would be able to now.  But in fact timers know nothing.  It is pure BS.  Astrology.  Reading tea leaves.  Old wives tales.
Invest because you think something is going up, or pass because you think it is not.  Don't sit around waiting for corrections, and then selling because it went up $2 and is now going to hit resistance.
Just watch the number of people who are tearing their hair out and saying they should have bought more.  They didn't, because they were trying to nickle and dime a better buy.  Go back in Reddit and look at all the people who were calling a bubble at $12, and $14, and at every price.  They are not totally losing.  That's what timers do.

When you say "cash" you mean US dollars.  Now let's consider that bitcoins can be used anywhere on earth to buy anything, in person or over the internet.  If you buy bitcoins in the US, they double in price, you travel to Cyprus, sell the bitcoins for Cyprus dollars (or whatever), and use those to stay in a hotel there and buy food and drink.  Now, I guess that at some point you are supposed to come up with a US dollar equivalent price for the Cyprus dollars, if that is considered the sale, and pay tax on that.  Is that going to happen?
I guess this is the point I am trying to deal with: most "investments" including gold, can't be spent directly in their investment form.  They must be bought in US dollars, held, then sold for US Dollars.  Then your US Dollar gain is taxed.  But bitcoins can be spent directly.  So every person, forever, is going to have to keep track of their cost basis in US Dollars for every bitcoin they mine, every bitcoin they earn at work, every bitcoin they get for sales on ebay or Craigslist.  Then, whether those bitcoins were converted to dollars or not, they are supposed to come up with a dollar equivalent for every bitcoin purchase or payment at the moment the transaction took place, and consider the gain or loss for tax purposes?
I cannot even imagine that.

Apple almost vanished forever in the 90s because of their facsist need to control everything.  Microsoft allowed other software makers to create windows programs, and Microsoft allowed its operating system to be used on computers created by anyone.  Apple did not.
And here we are again.  Apple is once again risking its own extinction by needing to squeeze every cent out of every aspect of what it does.  I am sure that this is being noticed by Microsoft.
note: I like the iPhone.  I am not a Microsoft fan boy. I have recently switched to Linux. But these are the facts as I understand them.

I would love to spend Ringos!
But let's not reinvent the wheel.  To summarize the many good comments here:
*- having lots of zeros after a decimal sucks- too hard to get it right at a glance - too easy to accidentally send $1000 rather than $100.
*- buying a tiny fraction of a btc sucks - people feel like they missed the boat or are getting ripped off - I got 1/2 bitcoin for $100 =&gt; I am a pathetic pauper. Nobody brags about buying 1/2 of something. And this will get worse fast.
*- denominations that are too small suck. Too much like a banana republic currency.  $13 million satoshis for a beer?  I can get a cold one for $11million next door!
I would like to add that I think it is a bad idea to come up with totally different names like Ringos (sorry Ringo, I love you man!).  As soon as early adopters who live on forums start talking about Ringos, half of the people who were about to buy bitcoins are going to freeze in their tracks.  They will assume that yet another new currency has come out. Is it a better currency? Is it a scam? Fuck Ringos, I'm sticking with Greenbacks, Martha!  Satoshis? If you want average Americans to adopt something, you don't go with foreign sounding names.
The stock markets have been doing this for 100 years at least. In most cases, stock prices are kept within a window of between $20 and $100. Yes, exceptions exist, but not many. Remember that the value of one share is dependent on the number of shares, and the number of shares is totally arbitrary.  And yet it is VERY common amongst the ignorant to believe that stock A at $60 is better than stock B at $30. Or that stock C, at $.13 must be about to go out of business. But Google could do a 10,000:1 stock split tomorrow and reduce its price to $0.10 per share. Same company, but people would freak.
So keep bitcoin in the name.
Change the decimal point as needed, not by a factor of 100,000 over night.
mBTC = mills can be handled by everyone. And when that doesn't work then go to mics.
Don't use term bits, becuase that is already used in terms of computers.

Is it possible for us to distinguish between a DDOS and slow service as it is happening?  If there is a predictable big fall in price during a DDOS, then having some money in a secondary exchange might be a great way to make 25% in a day.  Also, as people start doing that, the price falls by manipulation will decrease, stabilising the currency.

You're wasting your time with all that stuff.  If you have an internship, you don't remember the dot com bubble.  At that time, something like 80% of all mutual funds held Microsoft stock.  Why?  Because none of the managers wanted to miss the boat. It was considered a sure thing, and regardless of what kind of investing the funds claimed to do, they owned Microsoft.
If you want to convince your boss, first tell him this: “The best performing fund in history” Malta-based brokerage Exante touts one of its funds as as “the best performing hedge fund year to date (2013) with a return of 4847%.”   They invested only in Bitcoins. Look it up.
Now your boss is drooling, and possibly getting an erection.

I disagree with the idea that gold is a better medium of exchange.  Given counterfeiting, why would anyone accept physical gold as payment? There have been recent stories about experts being duped by counterfeit gold bars. If experts are fooled, anyone can be fooled.
I know that a bitcoin is not counterfeit, because a bitcoin cannot be counterfeit.  I cannot know, without drilling and testing, that a gold coin, gold bar, etc. is pure gold.
Furthermore, this article ignores the fact that a huge fraction of all transactions are now done on the internet.  Gold is useless on the internet.  Bitcoins can be used face to face, and on the internet.  Again, bitcoins are better than gold.
I am not arguing that there is a competition between gold and bitcoins.  I am disagreeing with the author's statement that gold is better than bitcoins.  Gold is not better than bitcoins.

In the beginning, Satoshi created The Protocol.  Now the earth was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and Satoshi was hovering over the waters.
And Satoshi said, “Let there be Bitcoins,” and there were Bitcoins.  Satoshi saw that Bitcoins were good, and he separated the Bitcoins from the darkness.

Awareness of bitcoins has gone up 100 fold in the last 6 months.  Is that bad?
People here, who have followed nothing in their lives with any scrutiny, think bitcoins are permanently stained now.  Bullshit.  The real estate bubble crashed, and idiots are flooding into another real estate bubble right now.

Dear economics deniers.  There is supply and there is demand, and where those two lines cross is the price.  There does not need to be a bubble or evil plans for the price to go up.  The number of press articles about bitcoins has gone from a couple per month a year ago to several per day now.  That is maybe 30 to 50 times more press in a year or so.  But that doesn't mean anything to you.  Because evil plans make more sense.

because the 2 orders for $500k filled, one at $200, and one at $150.  Then the price danced around $150 a bit because the disoriented were still throwing themselves into the icy water.  And now we are in the "make it all back in 12 hours" phase.

The US Mint was founded in 1792. The first dollar coins were worth their silver value.  In other words, the dollar had no value, silver had a value.  For something like 180 years after that, the value of the dollar was tied to an underlying metal.  So it took 180 years for the underlying value of the dollar to stabilize enough to disconnect it from an underlying metal (I do not want to discuss the merits of that decision here now).
Bitcoins are 4 years old.  Until they reach some kind of equilibrium wrt their use as a store of value and as a medium of exchange, the price will be volatile.  And afterwards it will stabilize.
The expectations of part time outside observers are ridiculous and irrelevant.

No identifiable hits due to organic searches involving "bitcoin" or "bitcoins".  However, due to changes that google made in the last 12 months or so, the majority of hits from organic google searches now return "not provided".  This is because google users who opt for privacy don't show up in the free data in any detail except that they originated in google. It's not that google cares about your privacy, because they do sell that data to big users who can afford it.  It is just not available to small users like me.
Furthermore, it is the more technically coherent users who are going to opt for those privacy settings, and they are the same people who are likely to know about bitcoins, at least prior to 2 months ago.
So in a nut shell, I can't tell if the bitcoins are getting me traffic, but I cannot identify any.

To short anything, you need to borrow it from someone who owns it, and then sell what you borrowed.  Then to pay back the debt, you re-buy it on the open market, and return it to the lender.
This can be done between any two willing parties.  But who would short anything that might triple in price in one month?  There is no limit on the amount you can lose on a short.  You know that, right?  If it rockets from $100 to $1000, then you have $100 to use to pay back $1000 worth of debt.  Good luck with that.

One observation:
Reasonable people have been preaching this risks, and warning everyone in hundreds of PSAs to only invest money they can afford to lose as long as I have been here, at around btc=$5 .  And I can tell you that at $5, not a single mainstream publication thought btc was anything but a joke, no Chinese people had ever heard of btc, whole exchanges were vanishing with all the btc on a regular basis, and Wall Street was busy stealing money elsewhere.
So is it more risky at $1000 than at $5.  Not a chance in hell.  At $5 it was wildcatting.  At $1000 it is buying a mutual fund.

The resilient resists shocks and stays the same; the antifragile gets better.**"

No.  Look at the actual trades.  Somebody was flooding the exchange with 0.02 bitcoin trades in order to slow trading, and every time that happens the price falls because people panic.  As the price fell the 0.02 bitcoin trades were used to set the price.
There was one buy order for about $500k at a price of $200, and another one for about $500k at $150.  And shockingly the price fell to $150, oscillated there a bit, and shot back up.
So somebody just saved / stole $750k by manipulating Mt.Gox prices.

I actually can call bullshit.  And I do.

When people tell me that a consumer electronic phone microphone can pick up secret codes on a computer, I think they are full of shit.  Why would they lie?  I don't know.  They work for the Isreali Military.  Maybe they want to make their enemies paranoid.  They call it disinformation, because lying seems dirty and pedestrian.  But regardless of what they call it, it happens all the time.
Like when Amazon says they are going to deliver with drones, and every slack jawed moron in the country says "Really?"  No, not really.  It will never happen, with the possible exception of military and emergency situations.

stop looking for someone to tell you that you did the right thing.  You invested based on none of the promise of btc.  And you sold for no reason.
"I doubled my money" has cost many people many billions of dollars.  Every great stock success doubled before it went up 100 or 1000 fold.  And every person who sold at the arbitrary double did so becuase they had no idea why they were there in the first place.

How to value it?  It's easy.  It is binary.  It is an option.  It goes to zero or super high.  It cannot rest at $1000 or $2000.
You cannot value it using phony present value of cash flow valuations taught in finance class.  Of course you cannot accurately value anything with those calculations because you cannot see the future. If you could actually come up with accurate inputs for those formulae, then you could just make straight bets on the inputs using derivatives.  But somehow that conclusion escapes the finance professor.

Here is why gold bugs hate btc: because they love gold and only gold.  
They have creepy unhealthy obsessions with gold.  They don't like the idea of an inflation-proof store of value.  They like gold.  No matter what happens in the world, they see it as proof that gold is the greatest thing ever.  If the price of gold goes up, Gold is Great! If the price of gold falls, that is proof that The Man is supressing gold.  And The Man is supressing gold because gold is the greatest thing ever.

The closest you can do to timing is concluding for yourself that btc is a scam, or btc is the best thing ever, and investing or not.
I think it is going up because it is a good idea, and nobody has found why it can't work.  I have no interest in why the price did a little jig.  It is irrelevant.
