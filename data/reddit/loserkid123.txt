Still, what kind of disruptive company ignores Bitcoin?

I think you made a mistake. Go be an uber driver for a few months and you'll see leaks to their system that need improvement. There are serious huge challenges they are facing. As a driver you would be on the front lines so you would know that challenges and believe me, you'd be working VERY hard.

Great but I won't be impressed until drivers can be paid with Bitcoin

seems like the CEO calls all the shots anyway. I would have left too. I take it back, it wasn't a mistake. Uber will go down like AOL in my opinion. CEO seems himself as david vs. goliath and can't get himself out of his deluded reality and face the real reality before him. It's called mental illness, unfortunately a lot of successes are lead by mentally ill people.

well sir that is very fascinating. I think what happens when you get into positions of power is you become content with the mere fact that you have a position of power. then you become useless to anyone but your ego. and then if you act ego-less, you get murdered. what a world we live in? but anyway, as someone who makes 100% of his income from Uber, I really hope they speed up the process of fixing all the leaks and get over themselves. they need to be drivers, losers like me. understand the psychology of the people who are on the front line, because that will ultimately affect their entire business!
