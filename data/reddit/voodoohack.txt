I knew that would come, they actually created the other "smaller"coins to use them as a backup for BTC I think the government doesn't want to stop the cryptocoin it wants to promote it :) think about it! we hate the government, if government hates something we must love it? but they actually want exactly this! BTC is becoming a world currency that will be traded only for gold and material stuff!!!

maybe I'll be late with 2-3 more days for paybacks because market was too stable for that week, now I'm waiting for a big trade on 94-5$ per btc :) await it, also as I know btc jam requests from me to pay you more (4% per week) I mean if two weeks I'll need to pay you 8% :) so don't be mad about the delay

I am 24% funded by now from total loan 0.5BTC, they'll activate my project at 75% total funding. If we don't succeed to accumulate the coins that week I'll put another business project with less BTC needed to accomplishment so the people with less coins could participate with comfort :) the price of BTC/USD will be going over 100 that week so we need to double hurry so there might be a bonus ;)
