I don't think it's fair to defend something by comparing it to an extreme opposite (full censorship). You could really do that with anything. Yes, it's creepy that he put cameras in a womens' locker room, but it's better than the opposite: living in a totalitarian state.
You also seem to be arguing that "it will happen anyway even if they don't do it." If that's true, then why do we need to be donating for someone to speed up the process?

No, the "it" was everything being public, not censorship. Sorry if I wasn't clear.


If complete loss of privacy is inevitable then what makes Web Archive special and why should I be donating to them?

It actually is federally run for the most part (it's a complex mix of public and private, but the feds primarily control it). It's a common myth that it's a "private bank", kind of like the myth that every developed country in the world besides the US has single payer healthcare.

Am I the only one who sees the idea of Web Archive as being somewhat threatening? Even if I get something personal or embarrassing taken down, it remains easily findable until the end of time. It kind of turns the entire internet into Facebook.
