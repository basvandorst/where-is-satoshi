Gold and taco sauce packets...  currencies for the future.
Imagine we are all sitting around the postapocalyptic campfire roasting some vermin...
Billy has his firearms and ammo stash, we can hunt and protect ourselves, Billy did it right.
Johnny has the taco sauce packets he hoarded for 20 years... about 2 years after d-day all the towns and supermarkets were cleaned out; There is no global trade, no spices or seasonings left, and ‘fire roasted rat’ tastes mighty bland, we break out a packet on special occasions where we want to remember what seasoned food tasted like.  Johnny did it right.
Mikey collected electronics, mostly a lot of ham radio and citizens band stuff, some of which was still functional after the EMP, we can communicate with each other at range. Mikey did it right.
Donny collected gold and silver, For years he put 10% of his pay away into precious metals hoarded in his basement, we melt these down, cut into pieces, or shave them off and use them as a known value method of exchange / currency.  None of the paper or coin money has any value now.  Donny did it right.
Joey...  well Joey spends his days attempting to cobble together enough computer equipment to achieve a workable LAN, to which he is trying to attach a full BTC node, in hope to someday be able to extract the Bitcoin he had sitting in the lightning network...  He says that once he gets the BTC out of the lightning network that we can now send these virtual coins back-and-forth to each other across this LAN.  Numbers on a computer screen!  He tries every wireless router he can locate in hopes of being able to send these numbers ‘wirelessly’ someday.  He often goes off about how some of his coins were on the ‘verge’ of ‘taking off’ when the bomb dropped...  did Joey do it right?
I suppose the takeaway is that various scenarios paint different pictures as to what might be important in the future. ;)
