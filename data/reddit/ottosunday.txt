How has your initial investment compared to the weekly dividend done?
I feel like combining an investment in shares with a pre-order for the 5 GH/s asic miner and using my spare desktop parts lying around to build a miner could be the best way to dip my finger into all the pies flavors and get a taste without shelling out the money for an entire pie

Help/mentoring would be nice but I'm not asking someone to tell me what to do.
I'm curious as to what others are doing and what their reasoning is so I can figure things out for myself. Comparing different tactics/builds/strategies for the present and future is   **clearly discussion**.
Unfortunately there is no *Bitcoin Mining book*, so I can't really do that. I could scroll through endless pages of useless information on threads and forums but in terms of efficiency to actually talking to people, it's pretty clear which one of those two options is better. Although that's not to say I'm refusing to look things up and research on my own, which I am doing, but only doing that would be stupid. Supplementing information from people currently actively participating is going to be much more applicable than information written or discussed weeks or months ago.
And no, that's actually probably pretty terrible advice. Throwing together a rig and just doing it could be a complete bust and it's much better to consider a long term plan of action and have some ideas for variables as they appear. If you know so much, I have no idea why you'd recommend doing that when the goal isn't "yay I'm mining let me tell my friends and try and look cool", unless there's some secret in your infinite wisdom in doing that, that you are not telling me about.

Time major difference is in LTC's mining algorithm and in the block size which is smaller and has a higher return rate.
The algorithm difference is why ASIC miners designed for BTC wouldn't work with them. Aside from that it also can't be merge mined how a lot of the BTC piggybacks can.
But clearly I know nothing, and shouldn't try and learn more and should just wallow in a lack of knowledge or try and gain it by lurking since actively seeking it through discussion makes one

Haha you think he's bad?
Look at comments

Good to see you passed 8th grade U.S. history and know you have the freedom of speech.
You really are, really, really smart you know.
Now that that has been established and you've heard what you wanted to hear, lets take advantage of our rights to not engage in speech and stop continuing a pointless conversation.

What's your plan for BTC and mining?
@_date: 2013-05-09 04:39:30
Can I use my regular BTC wallet for this type of transaction or does it require an account with them?
@_date: 2013-05-06 16:14:24
Yeah didn't know if this was quite the right sub-reddit but considering it was still bitcoin related I figured it was fair game and more likely to get better responses since there's a MUCH larger user base of @_date: 2013-05-07 00:11:01
I don't think you're in any position to say that or have any solid reasoning behind that.
Good thing everyone is entitled to their own opinions.
@_date: 2013-05-09 04:22:04
So cryptostocks are miners running off of the pre-asic mining hardware?
Are you sure it would be wise to invest in them since ASICS are supposed to come out in mass this summer?
@_date: 2013-05-07 01:25:53
Do you plan on doing that as more powerful ASIC miners come out or with multiple 50's or 25's?
What makes you think the 25's will ship before the minis?
@_date: 2013-05-06 16:24:57
I'd probably want to cash out when things escalated to the higher arms race levels. I'm still in college and although I feel I've got the capacity to allocate enough time to this to take it seriously I'm still in college and things are prioritized haha.
Maybe invest in the 25GH/s, mine and enjoy the run and learning experience and cash out at (*hopefully*) the right time, sell the hardware to possibly break even on the investment, and (*hopefully*) have a small profit from the BTC gained
@_date: 2013-05-07 00:56:40
Haha that sounds incredibly sketchy, how is it profitable to host an ASICMINER if you dish out it's earning in exchange for investments?
Someone has to be losing in this situation, and I feel like eventually individuals will lose for sure since I can't figure out a way for both sides to be profiting from this.
@_date: 2013-05-09 04:45:03
Is it [Bitfunder]( that I need to open an account with?
@_date: 2013-05-06 17:31:16
Which BFL machine did you order?
Any idea when you'll get it? My recent research revealed a ton of rumors and what looks like bad news as to the delivery date of BFL miners
@_date: 2013-05-06 16:22:09
Ah, I apologize for the confusion.
If you've got information to share on possibly investing instead of mining (which I've read a little bit about, and it apparently being more successful than just in mining) I'd love to hear about that and was my next step in the research process, I just happened to look into mining first since it's been such a popular topic and I figured individuals would have more information on this at the moment.
@_date: 2013-05-06 15:01:09
Experimentation and the possibility of turning a profit without major losses. The goal is to learn and at least break even.
@_date: 2013-05-09 04:22:45
These both look really promising but I don't understand the way to go about investing in either of these.
What exactly do I need to do?
@_date: 2013-05-09 04:26:52
What is the difference between PT and non-PT shares?
And since their shares are going up it'd be better to wait until they dip to try and invest then is what I'm guessing you're recommending? 
@_date: 2013-05-06 15:39:52
I've tried to research delivery dates  but there are so many conflicting opinions and information on BFL's.
If I ordered today for example, do you have any idea when I'd get the product by or where I could find information to determine and get some sort of guesstimation on that?
It seems like if I can get it and mining before the total hash rate reaches 1000 TH/s  and around or before the 500 TH/s it would be a worthwhile investment.
This is the kind of information I was looking for and having trouble figuring out/calculating for myself.
Thank you.
@_date: 2013-05-09 04:40:49
Normal exchange shares come from bitfunder, and auctioned shares come from owners of a bitfunder share correct?
How does possession of the shares work? Is this integrated into the bitfunder account with BTC as well?
Also what is the difference between PT and non-PT shares?
@_date: 2013-05-06 15:26:53
The ability to actually discuss things with individuals vs. reading other conversations I can't participate in or directly garner more information from?
If that's not to unreasonable
@_date: 2013-05-06 16:29:14
Forum trawling.... *shivers*
**SO** time consuming with the probability of learning nothing
...Might have to do it though
@_date: 2013-05-06 19:07:53
Just leave then.
If you clearly don't want to help and point out any errors or contradictions I'm making then stop wasting both our time.
If you want to gloat or try and make yourself seem better because you know more, go do it somewhere else. 
I'm quite aware I don't have everything grasped down to the dot in completeness, which was the point of this post.
@_date: 2013-05-07 00:10:23
How long ago did you place your order?
My concern is that going for something about the 5 GH/s has higher potential to be a complete dud investment if I get it after the difficulty is raised tremendously over this summer.
I feel like I'd want at least the 25 GH/s model but it's price tag with unknown shipping date make it a little too risky.
@_date: 2013-05-07 14:32:59
Hopefully you'll learn a little bit of respect and courtesy in general with your interactions with people.
Whether through self realization or getting your ass beat speaking to people like this, hopefully you'll get the message eventually.
This will be the last comment and your account is set to be ignored from now on so need to reply.
Have a nice life.
@_date: 2013-05-07 01:26:41
Ah I see, I thought they were using BFL's ASIC miners or something of the sort. This makes more sense.
Thank you again for the information, would you mind giving me a couple links to point me in the right direction where I can research this further?
@_date: 2013-05-07 00:08:54
Hm sounds like it wasn't too bad of an experiment, have you thought about LTC mining at all or tried that yet?
@_date: 2013-05-07 04:49:51
Of course I am, fortunately that's not a legal right I'm taking advantage of, although you seem to be fully embracing and taking full advantage of your right to be a cunt.
I wonder if you've got the balls to do it in person or if it's just an internet thing to make you feel better about yourself by trying to put people down who know less than you?
@_date: 2013-05-06 15:59:58
I have a gut feeling BTC will remain stable as a currency, but with the idea of turning a profit off in the future what do you think the best investment for the present would be,
Should I build a rig so it's mining now, or invest in one or two BFL 5GH/s knowing I'll have the hardware in the future?
@_date: 2013-05-06 16:15:53
So what do you think of 2-3x 5GH/s or 1x 25GH/s miner?
As long as I can about break even and learn something in the process I'm happy, but if possible and feasible turning a profit is clearly ideal.
@_date: 2013-05-06 15:25:45
Well thanks for the correction, I thought a newbie post constituted more of "what is bitcoin", "how do I get bitcoins" and how to set things up compared to asking what other people have done rig/setup wise and what would be the best route to go about mining would be as far as hardware.
Okay so what I've determined from Googling all those things is that an ASIC miner wouldn't be a good investment because of the time it'll take to actually receive the product from ordering now will make it almost insignificant because of the increase in difficulty from other people who will get their ASIC's earlier.
So with that nixed out of the equation, what do you think about putting together a mining rig?
If I'm correct it seems like the # of LTC miners is increasing because of ASICS (possibly) being on the horizon for release and it'll swarm with people once they're released for sure which will up the difficulty and decrease profitability as well.
@_date: 2013-05-06 17:41:59
A) You're making a lot of assumptions.
B) You're being an asshole for no reason.
I know I won't be able to put together a mining rig near an ASIC and its hashrate which was the point of asking about how effective building a rig to mine BTC until ASICS are released in mass would be, and then transitioning the rig over to mining LTC.
The reason ASIC and LTC are in same sentence is because of what's above^ with the idea of mining BTC with a custom rig and investing in an ASIC, and then transitioning the custom rig over to LTC. I'm aware of the differences between LTC and BTC.
I know I'm late to potentially actively participating in "the game" but I'm not trying to "get rich" with LTC, BTC or cryptocurrency. Since it's something that's made so much headway it's something I'd like to participate in as a learning experience with the obvious goal of trying to make some sort of profit with hopefully breaking even.
If you don't want to contribute in any positive way no one is making you read this, comment or participate in the thread.
@_date: 2013-05-09 04:19:23
So cognitive is a miner counting on getting BFL machines?
Are they currently up and running already or selling out shares in anticipation of their hardware arriving soon?
@_date: 2013-05-06 15:57:56
Although I could throw a huge investment into mining since I'm a college student with some stable income and friends with the same, I don't think a ridiculous high price point for an early ship is something we'd be wanting to gamble on.
I was looking at building a single rig in the sub $1500 range and I've already got some hardware on hand, or getting 2-3 5GH/s miners, or a single 25 GH/s miner from BFL.
I know ultimately it's a gamble either way but I'm wondering what "gambles" if any others are taking to help me make my own decision.
Any other opinions or advice to share?
@_date: 2013-05-06 16:47:22
Is this something you've done yourself??
Any information to the reputability of btc.tc. ?

@_date: 2013-05-09 04:18:37
The weekly dividends is something that I was primarily interested in.
To purchase stock don't they only accept bitcoins though?
Meaning I'd need to buy Bitcoins, and then buy the stocks with BTC?
@_date: 2013-05-06 18:42:23
Haha I appreciate the encouragement, glad there's a couple friendly faces with Bitcoin at least within the Reddit community.
I dabbled a little bit in mining back in 2010 with a single 6950 and after a while I think I had about 7 or 8 BTC... really wished I'd just stuck with it. Would've payed off immensely, I don't even remember my wallet info to recover those BTC :(
But anyways on to the present, I think I'm going to stay away from ASIC companies since the release and shipping dates are so finicky and there are already SO many pre-orders I feel like it'll be a while till they get products out to recent buyers. 
I'm an avid PC builder and gamer, so investing in hardware for a custom miner wouldn't be a complete dud if mining LTC got to difficult or if I tried to get what BTC I could before ASICS release in mass.
My situation is that I'm curious about making an investment and learning more about digital currency, and my friends and I are all on full scholarship + monthly allowance so we have some extra money that *could* be put to use, but it's not on a massive scale, more like an extra grand per person at the moment. So I'm sort of doing the research myself to consider doing things just myself or working with a couple friends to build and operate a couple rigs or something of the sort. Thankfully because of our free housing, and internet running the equipment doesn't cost more than the initial start up costs.
