Listened to probably 20 different sets of floorstanding speakers. This for the price sounded the best. Crisp highs and the low end was insane. Yes, it was out of my budget too. but fuck it right?

Just log out of your account, have a few alt email accounts, re-register under that new email. Presto, you can reuse the bitcoin code. Auto complete on was helpful in getting it done so fast.

I will be replacing the bitcoin I spent this payday. =) Was nice saving 525$ on all the stuff I'd been window shopping for.

Sounds like a scam to me. Just buy the coin outright and save to a cold wallet. In 3 years its gonna be 500k, or some dude eats his dick.
