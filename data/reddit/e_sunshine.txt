I thought Binance support did not do skype/video calls and that if you do one with someone claiming to be from Binance that it was a scam?

I'm ready for them to start competing against each other to see who has lower spreads.   
I hate having to purchase $25,$50 even $100 above ask on coinbase. 
It sure is convenient though.

I still dont get what the significance of 6.15btc is
@_date: 2019-10-25 20:56:49
Impressive yes, but not prophetic.

I wonder why they shred it.

Wasnt dude allegedly a time traveler?
@_date: 2019-10-09 16:04:29
I never said time travel was real, but the prophecy from the screenshot was made by someone who claimed to be a time traveler.  
Geez bro, communicate nicely with other people much?

Wait. I though negative interest rates is where the bank pays you to take a loan or to have an account there. Not the other way around.

One of them is obviously lying about being a time traveler...

It doesn't make sense to spend bitcoin more when it's down vs it being up? Does it?
When the sat value is up, wouldnt you have to spend less btc to make your purchases and more btc when value is down?

Only if you sale before it goes back up will you have lost.
