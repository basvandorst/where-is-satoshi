Yes. Physical Bitcoin is worth 7 digital bitcoin

Not even close yet. $19.5K was a test run

That’s what I was thinking also. I haven’t seen except maybe 1 or 2 all year. I want the spam and scam ICOs to leave the market because that  will actually strengthen the market.  The media keeps so many people, atleast here in America, ignorant to all the good and help worldwide crypto and the Blockchain will do. It’s really just suppressing it temporarily though, the break out and main stream adoption is going to happen. Just a matter of when now

It’s a beautiful thing 
@_date: 2018-03-12 17:18:11
That’s awesome ��

No point in using an exchange if you’re just going to get your money stolen because they’re so unsecure that they don’t even care to verify ID.

BTC dropping to $7,500 today and then bouncing back to $8,250. Then BTC is mooning tomorrow (3/19/2018) morning at 7:43 am Eastern Time ������

100% agree
@_date: 2018-03-06 13:18:42
You’re right. Didn’t even see that. Definitely not Blockchain if you’re looking for hardware lol
@_date: 2018-03-11 04:20:00
I’m with you man. Thinking end of March, beginning of April time we’ll see some things start to take off. 
@_date: 2018-03-11 04:21:31
Bruh, bad advice. Sell now and lose? Or HODL, buy if possible, and win big?
I’ll take the later. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 22:58:19
Yeah just like the market can co exist with Wall Street and banks. People just like to get so one sided with it. May drop the value of the USD but there is room for both 
@_date: 2018-03-02 13:42:55
True, but point being is that any exchange that doesn’t even care to verify could easily take your USD, never send you your crypto, and shut down because they’re so illegitimate that they don’t even verify their users. As soon as you buy and send your money you’ll be praying and hoping until you receive your crypto. 
Or another scenario... You want someone stealing your info, going to a low end exchange that doesn’t even verify its you, and then they buy crypto with your money? 
Risk management man. To each their own, it just doesn’t seem worth it to me. 
There are plenty of other exchanges you could register on that verify within a day or two and then you’re on your way with less risk.

Thank you for this. 
@_date: 2018-03-06 17:36:26
Time to make some profit man. 
@_date: 2018-03-06 10:57:02
Blockchain. For BTC and ETH
@_date: 2018-03-06 11:30:08
Not spiking at all right now lol
@_date: 2018-03-14 11:43:13
Lol I know, it’s ridiculous. Why would google ads destroy Bitcoin ��
@_date: 2018-03-02 13:45:40
Not sure what would be taking so long man. Have you tried reaching out to their support team? I think it took 2 days for me to be verified. 
@_date: 2018-03-13 19:44:06
That’s cool, glad to see you spending and being active with it. That’s what we need for more adoption
@_date: 2018-03-13 00:29:16
If you have a website or social media presence on any platforms then you could advertise there that you accept whatever currency it is you want to accept. It’s a start at least 
@_date: 2018-02-27 23:47:09
Why you got a pic of Warren Buffet then
@_date: 2018-03-08 23:45:59
Spot on with this statement. 
@_date: 2018-03-04 12:53:12
@_date: 2018-03-02 10:28:55
Why would you want to buy on an exchange that doesn’t make someone get verified?
