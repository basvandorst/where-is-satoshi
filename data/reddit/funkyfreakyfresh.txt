Just one time for each account, and you can do that one on-chain transaction slow and at a time when it's not expensive
@_date: 2018-01-11 05:19:37
You rock!! 
@_date: 2018-01-15 19:29:52
wow if the dip goes all the way to 10k before running past 20-30k (which is what that pattern suggests) big balls for not panicking and/or doubling down at 10k
@_date: 2018-01-16 09:46:20
Oh  I know was sarcastic,  one month of ups gone isn't bad 
@_date: 2018-01-17 03:13:08
It's too late to sell, time to hold.  I think bottom was around 10k, half the all time high,  which is par for the year. 
@_date: 2018-01-15 19:22:13
eh, without lightnig and segwit quickly, it could still be replaced by a more steady one, or fade and not be replaced by a "top dog" because ethereum and other network coins will be huge, and probably monero, dash, ltc, and other payment ones will fill the gap, until one of those is the biggest I guess.
@_date: 2018-01-17 03:11:59
Yeah I was looking at that for a while, glad I didn't bite 
@_date: 2018-01-16 08:42:10
Almost down to the all time high from November 2017, I don't know what to do 
@_date: 2018-01-16 13:30:32
Not you 
@_date: 2018-01-11 05:20:32
Happy cake day and thanks for your work 
@_date: 2018-01-15 19:25:49
Wow how the fuck do you make it this far into a comment section without even reading the fucking headline.  wtf goes through your mind?
@_date: 2018-01-15 07:39:18
Dude you are way UNDER estimating what you can use a safe, decentralized , public ledger for 
@_date: 2018-01-16 08:42:50
Alright folks you heard it,  wait for this guy to finally panic sell, and BULL 
@_date: 2018-01-15 18:52:34
No but you can just escrow it using a third party service on the lightning network (I'm guessing pretty soon) for anything serious.
@_date: 2018-01-12 12:26:15
Yes please let's get this info up 
You can get it posted on the mem pool in just a few seconds.  Even with a low fee.
And for a small order, a shop won't mind it not fully showing up until the evening. 
Edit but also,  btc needs lightning, segwit, and even still people are still going to move to other crypto that's faster and cheaper and more efficient
Btc may or may not stay the gold standard for value,  but lightning and segwit are the only way is possible 
@_date: 2018-01-16 13:33:46
Chinese new year!?  Those bastards!! 
@_date: 2018-01-15 17:21:50
Woah just because it's on blockchain doesn't mean it's visible for everyone .... 
Edit in fact medical records is the perfect example
You have a single data record that can be encrypted so only emergency workers, or who you authorize, can see it, and it's a single record that can be added to but not edited, you could have levels of authorization to see it, smart contracts for sharing the info, decentralized so if a hospitals system goes down its ok, able to be accessed instantly anywhere with 100% certainty everyone involved is looking at the same data, seems a perfect case use! 
@_date: 2018-01-23 15:57:01
No way man, lots of those are not "alts" they are technical blockchain projects 
The ones that are just a coin to spend, they'll likely crash with lightning. Unless they can still be better (rai blocks claims)  or anonymous (monero claims)  or are already a second layer solution for btc (I think that's what tenx and Monaco will do? Something like lightning?)  then the other money ones are useless 
But the ones for real purposes, absolutely some will stay.  
@_date: 2017-12-15 13:54:55
...what? 
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:40:04
Walls usually fall once people really start buying them. 
It's rare to see one anymore that actually stays until it's sold. 
I think taking any serious nibbles will move the high and low these days,  especially with so many exchanges to influence now.  Nobody wants to leave their whole whale stash up when the price will move again right after.  
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:39:13
Can someone explain lightning and if this includes any level of centralization? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:20:28
It's also good advice if you look at all the other dips
Edit lol down voted, the price is already stabilizing and a solid 30% above the lowest dip. Buying the dip seems fine advice 
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:57:26
Yes yes I know the analogy 
They're also traded like stocks 
They're also traded like something completely new, because at least with many crypto, owning the coin is owning the network, helping run the network, or can be staked for rewards,  or carries an actual intrinsic value,  beyond just transferring money 
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:17:05
You got the wrong alts my friend. Mine are way up
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:33:26
Just ask @_date: 2017-12-22 07:18:43
Nonsense,  remember the year started at under 1000, and other dips went more than 75 percent loss 
@_date: 2017-12-30 11:33:40
Yeah I need you get my stuff off exchanges for this reason,  going in slow chunks 
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:29:53
It's up, it'll be down Sunday and Monday as futures start,  maybe a bit more 
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:03:27
No,  then I'm just not making as big a gain.
I didn't sell everything but I also have fiat money. I also have money in exchanges.
 ALL YOUR FIAT MONEY IS MONEY THAT YOUR NOT MAKING ON BTC DID YOU REALIZE??? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:10:10
Yeah lol, lots of people saw this boom last week and sold, myself included. 
I'm watching to buy back of course.  
But never sell is only safe if the only money you have in it can be lost. 
If you need the money, need the gains, definitely sell your gains. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 10:48:54
And maybe that's why they locked it for no reason.. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:55:30
Ok interesting 
Any idea when it'll be live? 
And how does this relate to atomic swaps? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:39:00
Bills are bills 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:41:23
Ahhh 
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:50:44
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:22:36
Exactly I did the same And bought more higher 
It's easier to hold and go all out, but it's riskier if you have real bills to pay 
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:10:20
Except you may have accidentally bought it not knowing the difference 
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:36:47
Exactly nobody knows,  but I'm protecting from Loss,   it rises I'll buy more and watch 
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:00:39
Some of us have to take our profits and protect against big dips 
Means we miss some of the increases, but protect against big dips in times like this. 
Hard to say of its done correcting, or if futures will short it big 
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:04:22
If you don't get the implications of the tech why are you here? Btc might not be king it could be other crypto 
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:44:26
They thought it was gonna dip,  but if it keeps going up,  buy back in because it'll keep going more... 
I sold around 12,150, but put an emergency buy back higher.  I think it'll dip, but if it doesn't,  cut loss and ride up again 
That's how it makes it just a little more after struggling,  then suddenly a big rise.  Lots of people doing the same 
Also the other way. Holds at 12,200, but as soon as it goes 12,000 and South,  it'll probably lower all the way to 11,000 because people are cutting their gains from the last few days,  a trickle becomes a snowball 
Until everyone goes,  hmm that's low enough I guess,  
Cycle repeats.  Until it doesn't.  Lol
@_date: 2017-12-30 11:33:25
Yeah I need you get my stuff off exchanges for this reason,  going in slow chunks 
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:49:31
But does that make it valuable? Because btc and crypto are valuable in themselves, hence they're traded like money 
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:32:31
Actually firms are setting up for loans, financing and such on blockchain. 
Not sure what they'll use to decide rates and how to collect. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:51:46
Eh is not dumb,  btc rose too fast and has futures coming, people likely to want to inflate and short. 
I sold my profits to guarantee them.  Not everything, not all alts, but I think it's a moment to take profits and buy more later 
@_date: 2017-12-12 06:26:11
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:26:09
Insider trading is still a thing... 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:38:22
This is related to btc cash...?  I think it's core btc trying to implementing lightning? 
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:12:30
Because maybe they're not Petty? 
Can you tell me any advantage cash has over most alt coins like lite or Ether or vert or any? 
That's what I don't get from cash. Will it scale better than existing coins? 
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:23:04
No that's what I'm saying...  Some coins actually do things, therefore have value
The ones that do nothing, however, that's more true 
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:27:01

These people are out for themselves only. Hope you can piggy back on them sure, but don't start thinking they're on anyone's side but their own.
They'll crash it on purpose if it benefits them.
@_date: 2017-03-23 07:59:54
Are they just ballsier then the alt coin scammers? Well funded to pay off high profile people?
@_date: 2017-03-02 01:24:01
Is it actually good for Brits though? I see a lot of congrats, but I think it's a sign of their feeling pound in addition to good for Bitcoin.
So especially Brits that early invested I guess it's good, stronger against other currencies than the pound.

@_date: 2017-08-13 07:34:52
Yrah... But a year ago if you said settle at 2.5 you would be the crazy one.  You're right it'll EVENTUALLY correct and them when it dips EVERYONE will buy back in and it'll raise again. 
I know I'm waiting for a dip to invest more...
@_date: 2017-08-09 13:36:27
Can anyone help me understand if this BitBet.us bet is completely validated?
I'm confused by the language of it.
@_date: 2017-08-15 08:13:17
Yeah I'm waiting to sell when it corrects,  but...  Not correcting yet lol
@_date: 2017-08-09 17:09:18
Care to explain? 
@_date: 2017-08-05 17:27:28
Should have sold to rebuy
@_date: 2017-08-15 07:35:59
Well it's all the percentage really 
@_date: 2017-08-23 06:24:24
What di you say to arguments that lightning is centralizing it 
@_date: 2017-08-04 05:28:00
It's etc being developed and useful?  Or just another alt to trade? 
@_date: 2017-08-09 17:51:47
Thanks I'll steer clear 
@_date: 2017-08-09 13:26:42

@_date: 2016-12-28 18:09:01
Wow even this sub isn't safe..
@_date: 2017-08-15 21:21:24
Yeah you could have put 4000 on it at 400 and ridden it to 500 for a much bigger reward.  Not as many folks had the balls for many thousands down at the time
Now everyone is 
@_date: 2017-08-05 06:42:35
Just buy more next dip!! 
However dip may not be below 3000.....
@_date: 2017-08-10 08:43:21

@_date: 2017-11-04 14:37:07
Because she'd ask....?  She could have taken the linden and cashed if out for usd too, silly not to do the gig.
@_date: 2017-11-04 14:55:10
Silly not to do a 200 thousand dollars gig in a VIRTUAL GAME, she could set up at home and do it.
@_date: 2017-11-26 13:56:19
Don't be silly,  it'll dip,  and this is half what it will be in a year 
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:30:46
I figure most hope for a dip to buy in more 
@_date: 2017-11-04 14:28:45
How is that irrelevant.....? 
They offered linden because that's the second life currency.  Some peeps use usd to get it,  others btc. You buy it on an exchange website,  it actually predates btc I believe.  But at the time,  they were going to pay her in linden because that's what the people playing second life use and raised.  It can be instantly exchanged in virwox 
Or you just wanna throw shade? 
@_date: 2017-11-04 18:29:47
They offered 200,000 usd converted to linken I'm pretty sure.... 
@_date: 2017-11-10 03:27:12
It's cobin going yet? 
@_date: 2017-11-23 12:17:11

That's actually the lyrics huh 
@_date: 2017-11-09 03:55:37
Can evening be solved with atomic swaps? 
You store bitcoin,  instant swap to another coin to exchange it,  merchant instant swaps it back ti btc 
Isn't this what "hybrid Internet of coins"  and other groups are working on? 
@_date: 2017-11-15 19:03:24
Right lol, 400 to 2000 or so is still awesome 
@_date: 2017-11-27 12:26:05
Dude in a year this meme will be filled with "omg I WISH I got in under 10k!!!!! 
Still in the 4 digits!!!! 
@_date: 2017-11-04 14:19:22
Right,  but you can use an exchange to change from linden to btc
Edit guys,  when you buy and sell second life money it mostly goes through one site,  virwox,  which is where she would have been paid,  and she could've taken usd or btc or linden from the payment 
@_date: 2017-11-26 08:19:10
It's GONNA dip. It'll increase too much for current demand,  dip,  and come back. 
It has and will again. 
Sad I didn't double down in the last dip.
I was waiting for a little more,  went to sleep,  woke up and dip was over. 
Shorting at just the right time is key,  but buying back in is more key.
Now just question if the dip is now,  because 9000 is crazy,  people spook and sell some for the profit,  dip to 7000, lower? 
Or is this going to push the market,  but 12k and dip to 9k, and buying now is fine? 
Pay attention to the memes, just memes and bbands and you're good, you'll see the market movements. 
Because in btc, even the Whales and movers can't manipulate it as much as the random feels of speculation. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:33:33
I mean...  You're talking like one week 
Because it's up from a week or two.  
@_date: 2017-11-26 08:21:30
Exactly,  that person took a loss for a while,  then made huge 
You open a short position,  then you don't panic and close it if it goes up.  You wait patiently  
Of course,  only if you think it's a true bubble 
I think it's going to dip and bump,  but the bubble won't be full for a long while,  or until there's a mass exodus to another coin
@_date: 2017-11-04 17:53:17
Yeah my first btc was bought through second life,  wish I never sold it 
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:48:40
Lol butt coin is still going?
Oh the irony of them telling everyone they missed the boat 3 years ago 
@_date: 2017-11-09 03:52:23
Yeah I wanted the dip to buy more 
But now I'll just make my own fork,  bitcoin United (thanks for the name idea)  
@_date: 2017-11-09 03:57:29
Yeah I was watching the news for the fork to buy back to eth and others...  Then was asleep when this happens. 
I think this is the beginning of alts coming back 
@_date: 2017-04-12 06:47:53
Explain like I'm 5 anyone?
@_date: 2018-03-14 12:04:10

Pretty sure they accepted bitcoin for years, and now bitcoin cash...  So?

Look at previous years.  Always dipped on Chinese new year hard.  I only found that out at 10k, kinda thought it was too late then to react :-/
I find the naysayers interesting though considering btc had worse crashes and recovered.  Recovered big.  As in people thought it was NUTS when it but 5k, bubble talk yada yada 
Maybe it's not btc but crypto will be huge 
@_date: 2018-03-05 01:16:04
Yeah why else would fees be high lol
@_date: 2018-02-07 11:00:58
Kind of, I mean if someone made "America on line plus"  during the dot com bubble,  and people bought it thinking it's real AOL or a new better one,  and then it all came crashing down,  AOL plus would fail but maybe AOL wouldn't 
@_date: 2018-03-09 09:19:00
Yeah but some regulated exchanges are fine.  People can still choose to use unregulated (as long as they don't try to go China route and block IPs from exchanges)  but if they do that,  I think it'll help push decentralized exchanges through proxies, which is safer anyway 
@_date: 2018-02-14 11:51:01
What is your answer to bitcoin cash argument that lightning is not "on chain"  and therefore reliant on a second layer, and trust in a system that's no longer decentralized? 
How can we verify that lightning is safe?  I mean I get that you should use regular segwit for a big transaction,  but I guess the main concern is that lightning is moving too much away from the decentralized ledger, from btc as a payment 
What elements of the transaction are still encoded in the blockchain? 
@_date: 2018-03-14 10:39:14
Yes but if you have a new protocol you need companies to use it 
Some have partners and some are independent but have companies making agreements to use their service. Big difference 
@_date: 2018-02-14 12:03:00
Ok so how do we know a wallet tied to lightning is safe? 
What if lightning network locks it all up? 
Or withdraws double?  Etc? 
What is ON the chain, just enter and exit lightning, that's it? 
@_date: 2018-02-03 02:34:13
Actually, Chinese new year, it really does. 
Check back after  new year 
@_date: 2018-02-06 04:38:10
It's a facade as we all wonder if we made the ultimate mistake, that this amazing new tech that could decentralize every aspect of our digital lives and release mankind from the shackles of corporate banking, just maybe the world isn't ready, it'll die, we were wrong, it's all a joke 
But you remind yourself that it's up from a year ago,  alts are solving real world problems and going real live soon. Major corporations are investing in crypto projects.  The tech. And it's implementation, threatens many sectors of the economy with a major disruption. It's already used daily in many countries.  Everyone can start using segwit today, and there are other crypto to spend 
@_date: 2018-02-06 04:40:05
Doesn't he have a while?  Or do you literally think this is the end of btc?  It's going to break the all time high again sometime 
And if for whatever reason btc never recovers, another crypto will. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 08:40:15
Huh? 
@_date: 2017-09-02 09:44:10
Honestly might be...  Crazy 
@_date: 2017-09-10 05:34:24
Hmm could you explain this more? Will there be another hard fork? And the purpose is centralization? 
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:22:22
Lol one month in and it's over... 
Guys seriously, weak hands.  It's ok for the rest of us riding though, hop off if you really want, but crypto ain't going anywhere.  
The dot com bubble burst too. And the Internet after became bigger than ever. More powerful and important than ever.

Do you plan tu buy back in your home area, or look for overseas homes even cheaper?

@_date: 2018-02-06 04:31:07
Maybe just btc 
@_date: 2018-02-06 13:13:25
Ok,  but that won't stop adoption because good crypto will have purposes, real apps that people use, etc. You're focusing on one aspect, the price.  there is also what it offers in decentralization,  and that will bring the prices up again

Has NOTHING to do with crypto, smart contacts,  decentralization,  open source money, secure banking, etc etc 
@_date: 2017-09-12 21:49:10
Blockchain technology is the way of the future,  coins are a big part
@_date: 2017-09-12 21:46:01
They never mention year growth,  just the short dip
Then onto OMG THE STOCK MARKET IS UP 5% IN JUST ONE YEAR 
@_date: 2018-02-03 09:28:23
Uh, it actually happened every year to btc,  and it's not quite like that 
Chinese new year everyone settles their debts,  cashes out investments,  pay lucky money downward and receive lucky money maybe too. 
It's big enough to make the trend 
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:40:46
Ok go look up those two projects, or there are a few more, that are building a method of second layer solutions through communication between blockchains.  I think counter party already does this to some capacity 
But I do love crazy pills!  Next time just do more research before your petty insults 
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:20:19
Uh, wow you have NO IDEA what crypto has to offer, or you're trolling 
It may not be btc, but crypto has a huge future 
@_date: 2018-02-03 02:33:07
...why?  By that logic, everyone should have bought at 5k, or you would have already 
Then they bought at 18k. And people are still buying obviously 
@_date: 2018-02-18 06:15:54
Psyche 
@_date: 2018-02-11 20:19:11
Is EOS anything yet...? 
@_date: 2017-09-12 21:41:19
Decentralized exchanges need to happen 
@_date: 2017-09-01 17:04:40
Seriously I keep telling my friends to buy next dip.. 
.  But the next dip will be above the current price maybe 
@_date: 2018-02-05 05:26:17
Yeah Yeah it died before many times,  oh woe is me, it'll never come back up to the 3 months ago.... 
Except futures can trade up or down, so if you're that confident,  go place a down trade 
@_date: 2018-02-12 06:48:23
Why an illegal security?  Because when they change to their new chain it's something new? 
@_date: 2018-02-05 04:58:33
Lol how many people said this in 2014, 2015, 2016..  
@_date: 2018-02-03 10:12:03
I believe dip is the word you want, and yes now they gave you a much better buy in point 
@_date: 2018-02-06 12:29:29
No, but that's why people will make stable pegged crypto too, and it's likely to stabilize eventually.  
@_date: 2018-02-18 06:16:56
It would need to be adopted by a big enough group of people 
@_date: 2017-10-06 13:28:08
Somehow bcash is still Above zero... Purely speculative?  No business accepts it? By losing the name,  they lost the battle in a way. 
@_date: 2017-10-06 08:07:04
Meaning I'll likely get a new coin on the exchange,  can trade it for btc in the initial spike,  and get a little boost?
Any likelihood that the split will overtake btc?  Any reason it really should?
@_date: 2018-02-02 07:55:47
Well, at this point it would be silly to have none too. It may stabilize but become the measure other coins still use for value.  Or lightning will save the day.  Or more likely second layer solutions that go between blockchains, like hybrid or icon,  will allow atomic swaps so people can hold btc but use better networks for transaction, using the general liquidity pool instead of their own. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:44:21
Thanks for your input, government overlord 
@_date: 2017-09-04 08:11:02
So is this sub just satire now? 
@_date: 2017-10-06 13:26:38
Interesting.  Has bitfinex said they'll split our coins and open the market? 
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:43:46
Lol how long is a down trend?  
1 day? Week? Month? We're barely into one or two bad months, still up from 3 months, that's hardly a terrifying down trend 
@_date: 2017-09-01 20:22:33
And everyone does and is back up 
@_date: 2017-10-26 18:19:57
Still less than international bank transfer and faster 
@_date: 2017-10-30 13:25:00
Unless the encryption is cracked (which means that ALL BITCOIN IS VULNERABLE)  then nobody is getting it 
Estimated up to 10 percent of all bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-10-26 11:44:44
Estimated 10 percent of existing coins 
@_date: 2018-02-26 12:48:29
@_date: 2018-02-26 08:14:46
Spent or moved? 
@_date: 2017-10-06 09:41:46
I don't get it.  You repeated the same thing for both possibilities? 
@_date: 2017-10-18 11:02:21
CNN in two days.  BITCOIN LOSES BILLIONS OF MARKET VALUE IN ONE WEEK,  IS IT DEAD? 
IGNORING the month before is still over lol
@_date: 2018-02-06 04:53:57
Lol who knows, but Chinese new year is coming up, and it always dipped big before 
 
Wish I knew that a month ago though 
@_date: 2018-03-14 12:47:41
K your analysis is noted lol
@_date: 2018-02-18 06:18:03
There are decentralized exchanges getting started now, the key is to keep your private keys! 
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:05:48
Lol using another form of money is overthrowing the Gouverneur?
@_date: 2017-10-18 11:00:41
I doubled my credit card debt for crypto. 
So far is working... But today is a sell day! 
@_date: 2018-02-07 05:36:18
Literally all those things are changing 
@_date: 2018-02-12 12:10:32
Ok I guess I don't see how that's "illegal" ?  Don't lots Premine?  Not that it's good, but didn't even ethereum Premine? 
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:42:49
Yeah gods forbid regular people get involved...?  And say cringe worthy things like always....? 
Yeah might as well pack up the new shift in tech, it's gone mainstream (which was the whole point) 
@_date: 2017-10-30 13:23:57
Better late than never. If you believe it's the future,  6k maybe it's nothing. 
I look at 3k and go WHY DID I BUY ONLY ONE 
BUT in one or two years...Maybe you'll say that about 6k
Shoot I had 5 at 300 and sold at 600, lots of those stories 
@_date: 2018-02-03 04:11:43
Lol that's the point people miss.
@_date: 2018-02-26 07:36:41
Smart fucker 
@_date: 2018-02-14 12:22:47
And what happens then if LN stops signing?  What's the time lock?  Is there anyway ever that LN can do anything without your signature?
I guess also you said before, you're continuously updating an actual bitcoin transaction,  meaning the original LN deposit?  Then your deposit is updated?  
How much is off chain, everything but in and out at the end?  
@_date: 2017-10-06 07:27:20
Wait in futures or what? Split is In6 weeks? 
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:46:18
Yeah kinda my point.  People made bad investments.  Some people made GREAT investments in the future, though. And in the end, the good investments were worth more than all the bad investments lost. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 12:50:52
Hmm ok and could anyone run an attack on the LN? 
@_date: 2017-10-26 18:21:20
Internet replaced a LOT what are your talking about 
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:18:18
Until after Chinese new year when it's gonna rally 
@_date: 2017-05-14 16:59:40
Not in Spanish!
@_date: 2017-07-05 14:23:47
Some need a reminder. Others are new.
He should be publicly shamed
@_date: 2017-06-25 20:12:04
Isn't that the status ico?
@_date: 2017-07-01 06:55:23
I guess the question is, are you breaking even fast enough, when you could just find another income stream and put tall you money from it into bit coins and watch the price increase?
You said new rig is 1200? Resell in 3 months for 300? Does each make more than 900 dollars on current prices in 3 months? 
@_date: 2017-06-24 16:09:30
I think I'm following, but what are the ramifications? A literal split like ether and classic?
Or a consensus on which direction to go?
Will the fork be decided by the miners?
Does the core Dev team make a decision?
@_date: 2017-06-15 06:03:32
Unless you just exchange btc for goods and services. Then the bank is out of the picture
@_date: 2017-06-15 06:02:40
Rothschild are still real. Not sure the other two do anything still. But Rothschild are very active in international finance still. Rich beyond belief
@_date: 2017-06-27 05:37:41
(just don't be a dick, we get enough of that elsewhere on Reddit)
