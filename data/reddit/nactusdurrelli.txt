The article is so factually incorrect I don't know where to begin...
*"A reward of $100,000 has been offered by one former QuadrigaCX customer for information about where the exchange's cash has gone."*
How can they confuse Kraken (exchange) with a customer??
Supposedly, Cotten may have moved funds to other exchanges to be safu...see link below.

Thanks, it's good to debate these things and play scenarios out. You're making valid points, however I do believe that some miners would altruisticly work if it meant protecting the network - many have ridden successive waves and few thousand to them isn't such a big deal. 
Again, theoretically a government could re-org and 51% every coin at once but in reality, ASICs aside, you still have GPU/ASIC resistant coins....and quite a few of them. The idea that they could 51% all at once is challenging to say the least.
The mood from the IMF seems positive. Like you, I think a fed coin will probably be a reality but I doubt if they will seek to destroy the competition. Some countries already refer to cryptocurrencies as crypto assets in an attempt to disassociate and regulate like any other asset.
If bitcoin truly is a digital store of wealth then it's a relatively new commodity that's safe from economic downturns and another place to funnel public and private money 'off-shore' just as much as it's economic freedom for a worker in a village in a developing nation...
I've linked Christine Lagarde's speech, I don't think it was particularly big news at the time but it demonstrates that the organisation has a reasonable idea of where we're headed.

I understand your argument - banning exchanges isn't the same as attacking the nature of the consensus but banning citizens and smearing the blockchain with porn or terrorism is a way of attacking the user consensus. I agree that the nature of the consensus is classically seen as the weak point. I've been debating 51% attacks for a few years now as I find them equally as intriguing...
Something to consider though is how many miners are sat there now, switched-off but ready in the event of an attack...strength in numbers...and if btc was taken down, you're telling me that eth or ltc won't take it's place?! It's too late, as I said, the knowledge is out there now...
We've also seen what I believe was a smear campaign that claimed Bitcoin is destroying the planet (which was a clever idea considering how socially conscious the community is). Of course, it was all nonsense. Maybe they think a few media campaigns will be enough, remember a small percentage of people understand cryptocurrencies currently.
As stated, I don't think a government-backed 51% will ever happen - currencies will realise when it's too late, complacency is our friend.
The IMF are already discussing government-backed digital currencies, I suspect Samsung is a major piece of the currently unknown hashing power and financial heavyweights are stepping into the arena during the quietest period of the cycle...
The government *will* always win but that doesn't mean they'll destroy every cryptocurrency in sight....history says that they'll just tax them....

There have been numerous attempts to kill bitcoin, shutting down exchanges and banning citizens from purchases, not to mention the media claiming it's death.
How do you envisage that a 51% would kill bitcoin?
There's already numerous algos including keccak and systems that alternate between multiple algos.
BitTorrents strength is in it's number of users. The biggest threat to bitcoin in my opinion is bcash and the like which attempt to divide and fragment the userbase. BitTorrent is also p2p and has taken a massive chunk out of the TV, film and music sectors. Back in the day they used to say piracy funded terrorism in an effort to stop people using it.
If a government wanted to do a massive re-org it's theoretically possible but highly improbable. I guess you've already come to the same conclusion.
@_date: 2019-03-05 15:03:05
Many have tried to 'kill it' and failed, as others have stated a re-org could be forked - let me phrase it this way, despite BitTorrent being around since 2001, why has no-one shut it down?

I was thinking about LN today and wondered if time-locked channels would be a good idea?
Say every week, the channel closes and reopens again, sending the week's transactions on-chain.
An algorithm could be written which sets the fee to something relatively low. If the mempool is high for whatever reason, the on-chain transaction wouldn't happen. It could also find specific times of day to transfer on-chain (we all know there's times when you can set a fee of 1sat/kb).
This would be advantageous to miners and potentially add an extra layer of security to the LN?

I'm no wise guy...just happy to clarify - I wouldn't be too worried about privacy if I'm buying a coffee with bitcoin.
Think of it like having a savings account and spending account. 
If I wanted to buy small items with bitcoin/lightning network I'd buy $100 worth and carry it around on my phone.
If I wanted to store bitcoin long-term, I'd open a Core or hardware wallet and create a new address. Any future purchases in said wallet aren't linked to the previous address on the blockchain if another new address is created. This was my issue with your coffee-bank account concern. It's different horses for different courses...in theory you could store all of your bitcoin in one address but this is highly unadvisable - hardware wallets like Ledger create a new address for every send and receive for this reason. 
Bitcoin burns bills of all denominations, it doesn't discriminate. Chinese shitcoins are a different matter...
Monero, Grin and Beam (to name a few) all have confidential transactions so privacy is there if it's of utmost concern. You can simply convert to bitcoin again in a brand new address.

It's pretty crazy when you think about it.
No-one can say exactly when p2p music or torrents became mainstream. The beauty of peer to peer is that the adoption rate grows exponentially with zero advertising - people suddenly realise there's a better way to do things.

I get where you're coming from - of course there's been scientific and medical advancements. I didn't mean to detract from advancements in other fields - I'm actually pretty young so I'm sure I could have a differing opinion when I'm old and grey ��
The Internet was a precursor to Bitcoin, I guess I was including all these things in when I said 'it's done more for society than anyone else in my lifetime'. It has the same disruptive properties to the Bitcoin protocol and has united the world in ways that generations before couldn't fathom. 
There's certain things in this world that divide us and others that unite us. 
Some of our governments are friendly to one another, others less so...the maddening part is that all want the same from life...we're all one people, no matter what a government says or tries to do to divide us.
TCP/IP and the Bitcoin protocol have transcended humanity's way to interact, socialise, educate, create industry and commerce...the list goes on. Disruptive technology seems to be the next major revolution which people will look back on in the same way that we do with the industrial revolution. 
First the Internet, then p2p, torrents...(I'm sure I'm missing many other things out)...
Amazon, eBay, uber, airbnb and Bitcoin...these are all disruptive technologies that have changed our understanding of how we interact.
Jimmy Iovine (head of Interscope Records) saw what was happening with Napster...he saw the train wreck coming a long way off (falling CD sales etc) and no-one else in the business believed him. He went to see Leslie Vadász (founding member at Intel), to see what could be done. 
Leslie basically told him that not every business is meant to last forever...
(check out The Defiant Ones s01e04).
p2p money is a natural evolution, we've been heading this way since the birth of the Internet.
The monetary value of Bitcoin is genuinely irrelevant to me - if I want to send someone $100 in any country in the world, I can. It doesn't matter how much bitcoin that is...the sale is conducted and converted to fiat at the other end. Speculation on price appreciation is only a small proportion of what Bitcoin is about.
I know that FOMO is a strong tool to increase subs and price, we're only human after all, but eventually I foresee people using bitcoin without even realising it. The current financial system doesn't work for the modern epoch.

With Samsung releasing the S10 tomorrow, are we looking at a major shift by the company into crypto? Rumours have been swirling for months about Samsung but they appear to be gaining traction with a story in The Independent (UK newspaper) today.
Samsung SDS have been working away for a number of years, recently releasing details of a blockchain accelerator for payments. They are also working with IBMs Hyperledger and have developed the Nexledger blockchain.
The company are also working on ASICs and plan to move into bitcoin mining.
Cosmoschain have announced that they're the first supported dApp on the S10 - a cosmetics app where users can rate make-up and receive rewards but this could be restricted to Korea.
If Samsung Pay is integrated with the Keystore wallet we could see contactless bitcoin payments (up to $40) within a month when the phone launches...is it time to have both checking and savings accounts with bitcoin?
The Samsung conference is live from San Francisco 2/20/19, 7pm GMT. 
I agree that it'll increase stress to the network but I think segwit will negate some of the previous bottlenecks.
It's also unclear how Samsung would deal with payments (potentially keeping btc and paying fiat to the shop directly?). 
I can imagine having $100 on my phone for small purchases and replacing as I spend it. I think store of value is slowly becoming inevitable, ten years was a big psychological barrier.

The battle to build crypto’s browser wallet
It’s browser wars all over again with the battle to own the gateway to the Web 3.0 space. The secret weapon that gives you access to dapps and manages your money and identity? Call it the “browlett.”
By Adriana Hamacher
News•7 min read•Feb 6, 2019
It’s Browser World War II! A half dozen crypto companies, ranging from giants such as Coinbase and Binance, to smaller startups such as AlphaWallet, are competing for market share in the growing cryptoverse. The battleground? An application—call it a “browlett”—that integrates a wallet, to safely store crypto, with a browser that connects to dapp marketplaces, services, exchanges and much more.
Just as Netscape and Internet Explorer—during the so-called Browser Wars—made Web 1.0 accessible for the first time to millions of people 25 years ago, the browlett is both the on ramp to Web 3.0, and its defining application. It adds the money layer to the social layer (Web 2.0.) to the Web 1.0 browser itself. And it’s set to be huge.
Coinbase, Binance, MetaMask, Brave are working on, or have released, new and improved mobile wallets that integrate dapp browsers. (See our round-up, here.) With the ability to surf a catalog of dapps, buy and sell tokens, manage collectibles, pay for services and tickets and access social media, the browlett could end up being at least as important as the browser was to  Web 2.0: The wallet-browsers will also control your identity, too.
“Wallets integrating with browsers (or vice versa) could do the same thing for crypto as Netscape did for the early web,” says Evgeny Ponomarev, co-founder &amp; CEO at Fluence Labs, which is working on the infrastructure for Web 3.0. “However, the devil is in details and the delivery matters.”
Just yesterday, Coinbase announced that Coinbase Wallet users can now begin to store bitcoin directly in their wallet apps—a huge steps towards creating “the world’s leading user-custodied crypto wallet,” the company said in a statement. Previously, the app only supported Ethereum, Ethereum Classic, and Ethereum-based tokens, and Coinbase says it plans to add support for Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin in the near future as well.
And early today, the OG browser company, Opera, released a beta version of its popular Android browser-wallet, which will allow users in Norway, Denmark and Sweden to buy Ether. Its older wallet has already been downloaded over 100 million times around the world.
For Ponomarev, whose firm analyzed the performance of 100’s of dapps, “the obstacle for the wallets which integrate dapp browsers is that they are limited by the current crypto user base.” He believes that Web 3.0. browsers, such as Opera, will provide new users with more freedom to explore dapps, without forcing them to jump in headfirst. “It looks for me like a smoother transition to dapp usage,” he says.
Opera project lead Charles Hamel believes every web browser will “eventually integrate some kind of [crypto] wallet,” allowing for a new infrastructure for the web and new business models to emerge.
The biggest browser wallets
Software firm and incubator Consensys [which funds Decrypt] has been banking on MetaMask, the primary route to accessing Ethereum-based dapps, since 2016. A mobile version is anticipated soon.
Metamask serves as a wallet for Ethereum-based tokens and also a bridge from today’s internet to the decentralized one of tomorrow. “The team is focusing on ‘not being ‘just a wallet,’ but a portal to the world of all things blockchain,” said Ethereum co-founder and Consensys CEO, Joseph Lubin, announcing the mobile release.   
Dan Finlay, Metamask’s lead developer, cavilled a bit with the “browser-wars” metaphor, saying that Web3 is more of an open community than the old, Silicon Valley-startup-competitive days of Web1. But he agreed that a lot of the action in the coming months would center on the browser: “In the near term, the browser has proven to be one of the most secure environments on a user’s computer, and so being a browser extension has allowed our users to browse a somewhat sanitized selection of interfaces.  But eventually, it will be clear that even the browser is betraying user trust, and we will need to provide something better.”
Finlay said his team has “some increasingly specific ideas about what this means, and we’re planning to share them in the next few months, and added: “I used to think that eventually the account manager would need to be built into the operating system, but I increasingly think the account manager may actually replace the operating system as we know it today.”
For his part, Lubin told Decrypt he believes it “might end up being a competitive space. [But] it might be the case that some group builds an open source version that ends up being a standard. It is very early days, so there will be lots of opportunities for differentiation.”
Browletts also promise to simplify the convoluted onboarding process that’s been thwarting so many potential Web 3.0. users.
Crypto’s wallet makers are in position to shape the design of the gateway to the decentralized web because they are the ones with most opportunity to study all the usability challenges and security issues that arise when a browser is paired with a wallet and permanently online. Users may get hacked or have their wallets stolen.
“For security, assurance that one is connecting with the blockchain is valuable, [but] having to download a plugin for that is not optimal,” says Lubin.
The next stage of development is wallets that provide a suite of features and dapps; a wallet that will be able to perform crucial functions: proving identity, interacting with dapps, trading tokens, buying tickets, unlocking your car and logging into Facebook—all without ever leaving the app.
For these reasons, everyone is racing to build bigger, better, more versatile browletts. Coinbase, the first to develop a one, is busy finessing its product.
“One of Web3’s defining characteristics is that it builds upon today’s internet of information with a new internet of value. Just like the internet made it easy to transfer data around the world, crypto makes it easy to transfer value around the world,” says Sid Coelho-Prabhu, product lead for the Coinbase Wallet.  “That’s why we believe that the browsers of the future will make accessing your funds and using applications powered by crypto a seamless, integrated experience.”
Most of the big cryptocurrencies have their own browser wallets in production or under development. NEO, for instance, is working on the Teemo;Tron’s browser wallet, TronLink, is currently in beta and so on.
Browlett battles
The nascent wallet makers are currently ascendant, having amassed insights and experience aplenty. But don’t expect it to stay that way.
Already, huge multinationals are moving into position. Leaked photos of Samsung’s latest smartphone, the Galaxy S10 suggest it will feature a built-in cryptocurrency wallet. Samsung joins HTC and several other startups in introducing smartphones with wallets. (Browser-linked wallets are less an issue with hardware manufacturers since phone operating systems are like browsers on steroids. Manufacturers have complete control over what apps to put in their apps stores. Thus they have “ownership” of the user via what the default apps are.)
Regardless of who gets there first, the possibilities for the future are intriguing. ”Eventually, I think we will see less interactive user pull as intelligent agents do our bidding, acquiring info and items for us that they know we will be interested in,” says Lubin. “Conversational interfaces with dapps and user agents will likely be a major next interface.”
But for now, the shift to a more decentralized world, complete with autonomous intelligent agents and other mind-boggling innovations, will see browletts become critical in the scheme of things—the next stage in the battle for technical dominance.
Lubin hopes that “empowering the user and enabling fluid choice rather than [a] lock-in” will win out in the era of the decentralized web.
But if past experience is a clue, the battle will be fierce, and the prize will be a multitude of spoils.

I think you're both right...
Yes, people need to spend bitcoin for the price to appreciate as this will increase adoption, however if I want to send $100 to someone in the world I can buy $100 worth of bitcoin and the recipient can exchange it to fiat at the other end. People have been doing this with bitcoin since it's inception and you can argue that most of the initial adoption formed this way.
On the other hand, reduced liquidity will also have an effect on price, similarly to what happens after each halving. As Bitcoin development moves forward, much of the circulating supply will become 'locked-up' in side-chains and loan services. This will undoubtedly increase demand over supply.
Both of your points are valid - the choice is there for people to either hold as a store of value or spend as a currency.

u/whalecheetah is right, I mean, if the FBI didn't intend to put him to trial for this, then why set him up??
The judicial system is redundant - both sides try to paint a differing picture of the accused and try to convince total strangers of the person's innocence or guilt....if the FBI didn't think they would be able to prosecute him for this, they possibly did it to give the impression that he was a dangerous person who had to be in prison for a lengthy period.

It's estimated that 80% of bitcoin mining is conducted with renewable energy. 
Large amounts of renewable energy has to be 'earthed' because there's no available use for it.
Also look into wind and solar farms adding ASICs to existing technology to capitalise on peak energy production times and flows.

I agree that it won't be one single event and it won't happen overnight but I do think we'll see progressive shifts towards mainstream adoption. Samsung have a lot of clout in the smartphone space and a native wallet would be one of those positive steps.
*no head beating necessary I hope* - p2p music and torrents made sense because they were cheaper, faster and more decentralised - I think we're well on our way to a similar adoption rate.

Check out whattomine, see what coins are profitable for your setup (calculate your energy price and put it in the calculator), mine and convert to BTC ��
@_date: 2019-02-08 15:20:24
Maybe I'm not explaining correctly. 
Yes, in your scenario, those coins wouldn't be private. They would be obscured but as you say, this isn't security.
However, if you used a decentralised exchange with a VPN, deposited your bitcoin and converted it to a coin with confidential transactions, you could move this anywhere with obscurity and privacy. You could convert back to bitcoin at any time and split the value  into 100 separate addresses if you wanted to - none of these addresses would be connected to each other on the blockchain.
I don't know how far you think AI is coming along but I doubt if you need to worry about this for at least twenty years. Machine learning and neural networks are making good progress in comparison.
It's not about being wilfully ignorant, it's about choosing what level of privacy you desire. Jumping through a couple of hoops seems like a relatively small price to pay to obscure your transaction history if you so desired.
Personally, I believe that Bitcoin doesn't need to be private - the public blockchain is an asset not a hindrance.

Yes, I know moving coins off exchanges is annoying and yes, I know that you'll lose a little coin each time you do so, but it's a matter of good housekeeping.
Exchanges will fall, usually when you least expect it, so the only actionable question is if your coins will be involved...

I agree but all of this legitimises what we already know about bitcoin....it might be their bargaining move but it will push adoption through the roof.
Christine Lagarde writes,
*Central banks might design digital currency so that users’ identities would be authenticated through customer due diligence procedures and transactions recorded. But identities would not be disclosed to third parties or governments unless required by law. So when I purchase my pizza and beer, the supermarket, its bank, and marketers would not know who I am. The state might not either, at least by default.*
Now I know she's not referring to bitcoin here but it does sound awfully familiar. 
I assume that the IMF are accumulating bitcoin - as a global monetary fund they've seen the rise in value over the past decade and witnessed mass-adoption during hyperinflation episodes (eg. Zimbabwe, Venezuela). To them, it's a hedge against the fiat system if nothing else.
