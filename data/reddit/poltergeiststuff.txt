I think [Forbes]( covered this well last month.  It is one of the reasons I refused to invest in Bitcoin; beyond my risk tolerance.  
And it is one of the reasons I choose to trade Forex, because it's dam hard to do this via currency exchanges because of its liquidity.

I'm sorry this happened to you.  If you want, you can contact the SEC and let them know what happened and who with.  Cryptocurrencies are not regulation, but the SEC does have the right to go after individuals committing fraud and other financial crimes.  They just cannot screen these guys before something happens, that's the basis of them wanting to regulation.
I'm not condoning regulations, just making a point.

This entire area is unknown territory without well-defined or known regulations.  They could pull *anything*.  
Don't want to retain a lawyer? That's your beef, but it's a horrendous risk-management strategy even without the court-ordered inquiry.  
I've nothing to hide and only trade forex volatility which is not new territory.  I'm not naive.  I retained a tax attorney, a lawyer and a CPA as part of the business strategy's risk management. 
Why the hell would one venture into unregulated territory known for money-laundering in an industry saddled with corruption among even regulated tradable and not have good risk management in place?
Now, the IRS has court-ordered release of documents because they're looking for stuff within this very market.  Brilliant.

Was this post needed? No. Market doesn't discriminate, but these god damned posts beneath it only prove the point.  
Go to bed and fap yourself to sleep, gentlemen.  You need your rest, because the one taking your money when you lose is probably a female.  But, hey, if you want to delude yourself into thinking you're  better trader than tits and a twat, help yourself. 
Your f'n delusions of grandeur and that ego bigger than Dallas is why women will kick your ass on the market.  
Oh, and if your women are stupid?  It's because you're stupid. Smart women don't bother with stupid men.

The inquisition applies to accounts whose transactions = or &gt;$20,000.  Anybody in that range should dam well have an attorney.  
To steal from another comment on this thread:  If they get in there and find nefarious tax evasion, that is sufficient to force Coinbase to open it up wide.

Thanks man, I'll remember this.  I'd like for it to take off my burden, but like you say it may not happen quickly. Algos move, they can't actually trade like I can.

I'm picky, but I'm also cheap.  Call around casually and ask that the tax attorney call you back.  Give a brief description and see what they say.  Call several.  Compare notes.  Some won't know jack about it.  Others will ask you the right questions.  
The tax attorney I chose came with a 2k retainer and works at $250/hour with much experience in trader's taxes and accompanying businesses.  I don't plan on needing him, but if I do - it's handled.

Develop a trade plan that works.  
Trade your plan and only the plan.  
Stick to the plan.
Trade what you see, not what you think.
Cut your losses. You can always get back in.
Trade less, make more. 
Cut your losses.  You can always get back in.

Trading's not for everyone, tho. That's fortunate for us.  hehe  I'll be using an algorithm by this time next year.

I agree with you on buying sustainable assets. However, the reality is that the debt doesn't matter. They'll QE to the moon or continue to manipulate with fictitious numbers to stabilize the stock market and whatever else they're doing to abate any global financial crisis, but the US debt has nothing to do with it. 
If the US fails, the entire world fails (for now!).  That means we can borrow until we chap the Chinese asses.  This is just a reality that our politicians on the federal level have always abused and will continue to abuse.  
The debt is only a talking point with all kinds of rhetoric around it.

My post is about *risk management*.  At present, I would not be able to afford an attorney, either.  Luckily, I set that up already.  I still do not invest/trade in Bitcoin and so  do not trade Bitcoin or invest into Bitcoin because the undefined regulations and trading parameters present too much risk for me.  
I fully understand the cost prohibitive nature of such assets and liabilities.  There is good risk management and there is bad risk management.  
Some would argue that I missed out on a lot of money last month with the rise of Bitcoin.  I could have traded it, but I did not because it is not within the rules of my proper risk management. 
It's about survival, not affordability.  Everyone's tolerance for risk is different.

I'm sure the IRS will take the time to determine the profits within an account and freeze that amount within the account, because they're a bunch of fair dudes.

Therein lies the problem.  Most of these are average ordinary Joes who bought into some BTC and are holding.  There's nothing wrong with it, but they don't understand trading.

cuz filing fraud is actionable upon the behavior of the perp, not the actual crypto. 
Regulations on the crypto is about having the exchange or brokers or whatever sign up in order to sell crypto.  They'd be required to show proof of financial viability, etc. 
Cracking down on perps who are committing fraud or scams is the same as cracking down on people taking advantage of old people by saying they'll repair a roof but never show up.  THey're not regulating the roofing industry, just slamming perps abusing people

 this company seems to be interested in cornering data privacy and encryption markets.  Their method of security via blockchain is likely what they are attempting to patent.  
It's very easy to make a minor change on an existing patent and call it a new patent or outside the parameters of the original patent.  
blockchain has many uses and comes in different varieties.

This is how I trade forex volatility, actually. I agree with the price action meaning potential sustainability.  
However, the buildings in wall street shit money.  Whatever someone does to bend over and pick up some of that money is no better than any other.
Don't trash the fundamental holders, because you bend over differently.

Child support enforcement being black vampires has nothing to do with trading and nor does it have anything to do with a person's character.  To jump subjects and relate any of these in this fashion is to denote a personal issue for which you bring to the forefront.
I suppose you think that men are the only payers of child support?
Your lack of intelligence and understanding isn't my problem, nor is it worthy of an argument - if you can call it an argument.  It's a lame attempt at seemingly winning an argument that you've already lost, kiddo.
Should have thought about child support and the consequences before you shot your wad off.  Here again, you're not very good at risk management, are ya?
