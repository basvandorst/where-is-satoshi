As i said, you are wrong. I believe you are just shills of someone with a great desire to hurt bitcoin/bitdaytrade or whatever, you are just in need of attention. I have got the site checked by security professionals worth 90 bucks/hour
@_date: 2012-08-16 09:35:08
We use a totally different source code, developed on another platform and language. We absolutely don't share a line of code with Bitcoinica.
I won't comment additionally. Until you can prove what you claim, this stands just as an attempt at damaging my brand, bitdaytrade.

MarshallBanana, you must be missing something. Show me how you can steal  my funds, i have an account with email alberto.armandi

I think this was a problem on your side, you gotta have a balance of at least the amount of bitcoin the coins are offered for, plus your bids!
@_date: 2012-08-15 14:33:08
I am sorry to sound rude, but i still do not see the point of that criticism. I am already aware of those issues and there are more important things to focus on, rather than how the homepage or signup page works with NOSCRIPT.
@_date: 2012-08-16 01:45:08
Retract your presumptuous non-sense. I didn't touch a line of the code. Go save yourself. Get a life
@_date: 2012-08-15 13:23:50
Bitday trade has passed an extensive testing phase during which a lot of hacks were attempted. We have setup our security measures accordingly. 
@_date: 2012-08-16 08:39:20
As i already said, you are the one who is lying. Sorry for disappointing you, but you didn't find any vulnerability. 
@_date: 2012-06-29 23:43:28
Looks like a scam. Totally
@_date: 2012-08-16 00:37:56
I only see one account with that email address. Plus, there's no way you can add HTML content on our site, rendering attack of this kind useless, moreover we use double-submitted cookie as a prevention measure.
@_date: 2012-08-16 00:23:03
Yes, that's our verification email. You can create a thousand of accounts, but if you are just going to withdraw the 0.1 bonus bitcoin, then forget it will work like this. The bitcoin bonus is for you to trade on our site.  
**No you can't create two accounts with the same address** and the site is XSRF safe . All the fud you spread is non-sense, please elaborate your thoughts in a more coherent way, so that i can better grasp what you have to say. Thanks for your feeback nevertheless.
@_date: 2012-06-30 21:20:31
We do not employ bots or automated bids against our users.

1) Are you talking about an insurance plan?
2) You are arguing about a proven business model that's being used for years. Sure, it's a form of gambling, since no one knows the future. But so it is the stock market, right ?

@_date: 2012-08-16 00:01:20
As said, i'm a public figure and real, so you can go to your local police station and say/file anything you want against me. Laws shall prosecute me in case of wrongdoing. I don't see how i'm acting behind a shield or similar. Additionally, we are working on insurances for customer funds. Updates will be out soon. 
@_date: 2012-07-01 13:09:46
We are sorry to hear you have this kind of bad feelings about this venture. It's a form of gambling, like many other sites. Why so much hate ?
@_date: 2012-06-29 23:33:57
and many are coming...
@_date: 2012-07-12 13:08:50

@_date: 2012-08-15 12:35:11
Exactely. since this is a real business and not a bucket shop we have to charge interest for allowing people to trade on margin. This is the norm.

Main dev here. The project is being developed. I can't give an ETA yet, but it's on its way to completion.
@_date: 2012-07-02 14:07:16
Cool, a category browser would be most helpful. are you planning to add one ? you could use a tag cloud, like this  
I see it nicely integrating with your current design. keep up the good work
@_date: 2012-08-16 01:00:18
what? first if i direct my LOGGED IN browser and change the address to one already in the database, it will not work. Second, then your attack would only work if you can convince users to click your link. You are writing BOLD statements, i understand your excitation but go check your facts first, before ruining someone else serious efforts. Come on man, be serious.
@_date: 2012-08-16 00:14:42
How is it meaningless ? I said that we passed months of testing without an hack. Does this carry any meaning to you ?
@_date: 2012-06-16 15:49:05
Right, sorry for that. It's being fixed while i write this.
@_date: 2012-08-16 01:39:40
I think you must have missed something in first place mate, or misunderstood it for something else. Either way, **YOU CAN'T** withdraw other customers funds. Cheers &amp; Keep up the good work
@_date: 2012-06-20 22:51:44
It will be considered eventually in the future. Thanks for your feedback!
@_date: 2012-08-16 16:24:05
All of this is FUD, funds invested in BDT on GLBSE are safe and the bulk of them kept offline. Site deposits are safe too.  Do not buy this bullshit.
@_date: 2012-08-15 13:19:58
The site works with JavaScript.it is essential for it to work. Your criticism is utterly pointless.

Not only Mtgox, it's a weighted average price from multiple exchange feeds.
@_date: 2012-06-16 15:40:09
You considerations are correct. Most of bitcoin projects originate from sketchy code and are not up to the standard needed and deserved. We will differentiate from the mass and will demonstrate it by running the platform itself. Security audits are being conducted every day by our team, yet no third parties have been involved.
@_date: 2012-08-16 00:26:05
What are you talking about ? withdraw someone else money ? this is utterly non-sense. The site is up since months ,and we never lost a bitcoin. Please go check your facts before releasing bold statements. Or are you a shill of the wanna-be competitors ? 
@_date: 2012-07-01 13:12:44
it was probably a temporary issue, maybe some player who didn't understand the site dynamic ? FYI there are players with more than what they deposited. In order to win, you have to be the highest bidder when an auction terminates.

I don't need you, or others, to believe anything. We are not a religion, we are a business, nonetheless I will agree with you that Trust is built with time. Feel free to join in now, tomorrow, in 6 months, or in a year. We are here to stay
@_date: 2012-08-16 01:18:01
I just did try and it didn't work, i don't know what you are doing.  This is bogus and you must have misunderstood something. Sorry, thanks for your important feedback and keep on trying. 
@_date: 2012-08-15 23:56:51
Thank you very much for your feedback, it is highly valuable to us. Point taken circa informations posted on our site about the internal management structure. Although i have posted extensively about my identity and background on the bitcoin forum, again, i agree that it is clearly not enough. We will work that out. As per our financial figures, i do not think it's even an option to publish this kind of informations. We have  to guarantee liquidity, such that transactions will be correctly executed on Mtgox and other venues, payout withdrawals and other obligations.  
@_date: 2012-06-30 15:41:00
Main developer here. Correct, the bids are not refundable.
@_date: 2012-08-16 00:16:33
You are welcome to just walk away. We also select our customers. Do you ever heard of this practice ?
@_date: 2012-06-16 11:33:15
We actually use the spot price from the worldwide markets.
@_date: 2012-07-17 01:04:39
In the next few days we will be rolling out full bitcoin margin trading on 
@_date: 2012-08-16 17:11:48
This is a beta site and the platform is still under testing. There are still things to iron out but we did not lose any fund. Can you prove otherwise ?
@_date: 2012-08-16 09:39:29
Thanks for your feedback, this actually reveals a bug that was not previously spotted. Unfortunately, you can't cash out your huge profits :D
@_date: 2012-06-29 21:40:22
Why? i think it's good
@_date: 2011-09-17 00:10:02
Why a whole lot of hype ? Am i stealing precious space to other "more important news" in your opinion? lately this thread has been filled with scams revelations and stuffs like that, not exactely fun. I thought i would not offend anyone with this. I am thinking hard about ways to solve the problems and I am also looking indeed for help and people to contribute. Hopefully at a later stage i will setup a github repository.
@_date: 2011-10-19 06:38:24
it will, only if a given number of adopters join the system.
@_date: 2011-09-16 03:39:40
The implementation i will propose will fix :
* The 'instant-transaction' problem
* No blockchain at all, coins will be minted solving integer factorization calculations on random input data with integers of different length, and different reward in terms of coins.
* No double spend of coins because of different inner working. This will be addressed in the near future.
I will publish updates on this subreddit and in the Alternate Currencies section of bitcointalk.org
@_date: 2011-09-17 03:38:30
I understand, i will publish a paper devising the concept probably on next week, as already said on this thread. 
@_date: 2011-09-16 03:13:51
I suspect Bitcoin will face serious scalability issues in the future if it gains mass adoption. I may be proved wrong anyway. I never said that i want to fix any Bitcoin problem. I just want to provide an alternative to it. Which are the worst  bitcoin problems, as it stands now, in your point of view ?
* EDIT : of course i will try to reduce the complexity behind bitcoin. I do not believe it is necessary for security reasons, security can be acccomplished without introducing complexity.
@_date: 2011-09-16 23:20:22
Alright, that's a point. This is being taken in account too.
@_date: 2011-09-17 00:13:33
Read below, anyway very roughly here it is :
* Reduce bitcoin complexity to the end user
* The 'instant-transaction' problem
* No blockchain at all, coins will be minted solving integer factorization calculations on random input data with integers of different length, and different reward in terms of coins. ([read this]( it's somehow related to this point and interesting)
* No double spend of coins because of different inner working. This will be addressed in the near future.
@_date: 2011-09-16 23:50:30
You might have misunderstood. Integer factorization will be related to minting new coins. Double spending prevention will be addressed in other ways that i will throughly explain when i will complete my research and study.
@_date: 2011-09-16 23:18:54
Ok i see, while i'm not sure he meant this since the start. Anyway the point is solid. Will take this into account.
@_date: 2011-10-11 15:47:21
News are coming soon...
@_date: 2011-09-16 04:02:59
Fair enough. I will update you guys.
@_date: 2011-09-16 23:17:14
I just wanted to have a community response, and i got one. Thanks guys.
@_date: 2011-10-18 17:20:49
This is just a first draft. All the features proposed will be implemented and a complete paper will follow soon. Some parts of the system already exist. Also if you read more about distributed hash tables and the likes, you might get a clearer idea of how data can be stored in a peer to peer network.
@_date: 2011-09-16 04:09:33
Do you mean do you suspect this is a scam or whatever? try* being less cryptic please. This is a public discussion. Don't take my words as an offense.
@_date: 2011-10-17 18:21:42
like for example porn accessories,or related items.but still the existent online sellers,which use credit card as payment method,usually take effort in hiding the "sexy" or "porn" part of the purchase,and just anonymize the transaction simply by showing only a company name.but bitcoin has the potential to cut out "the credit card statement risk",with risk meaning "purchase not allowed items" for all the reasons in the world,in regard to the items i proposed here.
@_date: 2011-10-18 17:10:15
No, when the miners eventually succeed in performing such a breakthru` that 2048 bits prime numbers are factorized then the whole world security would be shaken, also the value of RSA-Coin would get the same treatment, but i don't know which direction the spike would take eventually, if RSA-Coin becomes a reality and we will exchange it electronically in some way. 
@_date: 2011-10-18 17:44:26
RSA-Coin in fact is not a "fantasy" and is not intended to "beat" anybody or any organization, rather i hope it would push the world for better security. Regarding the 10 minutes issue you mentioned, of course it's a valid point, but it can be fixed keeping the difficulty low, as said in the draft, if people joins the network, difficulty will increase and the 10 minutes will adjust accordingly.
@_date: 2011-09-16 23:11:16
I do envision a scenario where more than one, given there are substantial difference between'em, cryptocurrencies exist. I do see those bitcoin forks like solidcoin or whatever like a 'competitor'. I see the system i have in mind like an alternative.
@_date: 2011-09-16 23:22:20
We could make it so that you could choose between using the currency anonymously or not. What do you think concerning this ? Would it render the currency itself lame ?
@_date: 2011-09-16 04:06:28
What do you mean ? care to articulate ?
@_date: 2011-09-17 01:21:01
Thought i have to clarify this. If you read at my [AMA]( you might think that i'm in here just for some quick bucks, well, that's not correct.
While i am interested in the business opportunities of cryptocurrencies and the new frontiers they open to making money, i'm in more for the Anarchic and libertarian twist i tend to *suffer* from. I hate government controls, am for, ahem, legalizing weed and so on. If this idea will become something real, i will be interested in building one or possibly more businesses around it of course, and my advantage will be that i will know the technology very well indeed.
@_date: 2011-09-17 01:53:58
Do you really understand well what the blockchain is ? the blockchain is a concept related to bitcoin and the implementation Mr. Satoshi Nakamoto chosen. I don't understand why this obsession with the blockchain.
@_date: 2011-09-16 23:45:41
These points will be better explained in the paper i will release, probably in the next week. Then we will be able to properly discuss everything, and eventually make changes. Integer factorization is a very interesting problem. Have you checked out the  [Wikipedia article]( about it yet ?it mentions intersections with cryptography, and if you follow links it's explained even better.
@_date: 2011-09-16 03:47:39
I have a feeling that Bitcoin is here to stay, but not alone. This would start as a pet project, i don't mean to take-over bitcoin anytime soon. Why reinvent the wheel ? i said i proposed a new system. I will release a paper very soon detailing all the system inner workings, including the scalability approaches.
@_date: 2011-09-16 23:13:26
I am also thinking along the lines of linear growth and unlimited volume. 
@_date: 2011-09-16 23:17:54
Hey, thanks a ton for the link. 
@_date: 2011-09-16 23:15:17
Yes, different inner working means shifting to another system, not simply a  variation or a "fork" of bitcoin. I think that in the future we will see consolidate a couple of stable cryptocurrencies.
@_date: 2011-09-16 17:13:07
It will not require it the way bitcoin does now. Minting is a more appropriate term to describe the process i have in mind. 
@_date: 2011-10-19 06:22:50
i never said to be a bruce schneider like guru of cryptography,this is just a draft, not a paper. I'm learning more and more from comments on this post. But surely your one does not bring much to the table.
