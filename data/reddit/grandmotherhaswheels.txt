I am 60 and my benefit will be very close to yours when I turn 66 and 10 months.  About $3000 a month as I have come very close to to the maximum SS pays out.  The total amount paid in by me and my employer over my life time is $201,000. Which is clearly stated on the SS website for my account.  I would really love to know how you paid in $600,000.

I wouldn’t take this billionaires advice if I were you. Nope. He’s just trying to sucker you. Just look what’s going on and it’s plain to see its all a ruse. Nothing happening here. Nothing at all.
@_date: 2019-08-07 13:07:16
So it’s all about the cycles. I see.
@_date: 2019-08-31 01:01:03
But he won’t take it because he can’t make change. How the Fuck is that relevant

Bitcoin in down to $11k from its all time high of $19k. Waaaaay more than the rest of the markets shown

You mean a grain of salt. A truckload would mean you put  a lot of credence in what he says
@_date: 2019-10-11 01:08:47
What he said
@_date: 2019-10-03 23:45:03
You’re missing the context of what he was asking

If you invested in bitcoin two years ago didn’t you lose half your money?

It’s a chart that shows how crypto keeps on  sliding down despite all these wonderful new “things”  happening

Never a guarantee the price will be higher. NEVER.

But that’s how ATH ‘s work. Take Amazon for example at one time it traded for a dollar, then 10,then 100 then 1,000. But it never dropped by 50%. Which is not a moderate loss, it’s ginormous
