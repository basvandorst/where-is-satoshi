No. Not identify. Just be able to if needed.
A cash business can see the person handing them money. And should eventually remember them to notice suddenly they are buying thousands daily.
I believe this option is just to give a proof of work basicly. Saying they are doing something to curb laundering. Which is better than nothing.

Gox has a friggin Twitter account.
If they took 120 seconds a day to post update's. Their price would be double and people would be much more butt hurt.

I'd love to see you carry a card stock. Or nice pre printed paper we can use to print these one.
As well a n of m ability to generate and print three wallets into a single sheet. Where two of the three are needed would be awesome for backing up.
Again a pre purchased ore colored sheet for this that my printer simply adds the black to would be amazing.
Keep up the good work!

As a money acceptor you need to know who is transmitting.
Details are held secure offsite, and would require a warrant to access.
But any ATM need's to track this info, if they don't they are simply asking to do jail time :)

Unless a country goes to Shit and your cash is worthless.
The thing with bitcoin is that it's globally controlled. All your other arguments are useless.

This ^^
we don't need a central PR, We need the like's of Coindesk to get their shit together before posting crap.
And we need to hang companies like Gox who instead of admitting the security of their website sucked, they say the whole internet has a major fault. (for comparison) just to save or try to save face.
Make an example and stop using these guy's, not because they suck, but purely because of the negative PR spin the just slammed on bitcoin to try and put blame elsewhere
@_date: 2014-02-28 13:39:19
The issue with Gox was all the moron's who used them as a bank.
Stop using exchanges as banks and we likely wouldn't have lost 850,000 Coins!

So you can not give these CBC retards any hit's
**It's an online, digital currency, but Bitcoin, accepted by a just handful of businesses in Winnipeg, launched its physical presence in the city Saturday.**
**It opened its first ATM at Santa Lucia Pizza on St. Mary's Road, one of the businesses that recognize it as currency.**
**Nick Burley, co-owner of Bitteller, the ATM company behind Bitcoin, said even though one Bitcoin costs about $815 Canadian, you don't have to buy a whole Bitcoin**
**You can buy, perhaps not surprisingly, just a bit of it.**
**"You can put your cash in and you can buy $200 worth of bit coin and use that as a medium to transfer," he said.**
**It's the company's fourth ATM in Canada.**
Bitcoin is a company, it placed the ATM, the ATM owner's are the one's behind the Bitcoin...
Just to clarify, the ATM installer's were not behind this, the other reporter's did really good stories.
@_date: 2014-02-21 21:26:35

@_date: 2014-02-16 16:35:31
Sort of, The machine will ask if you have a wallet or not, and if not it will print a new wallet/private key, you still need to scan the wallet.
This is so the system doesnt keep any track of the wallet it generates.
(it is still suggested to sweep the paper wallet asap)
This machine has a hot wallet, and therefor does not send to you from the exchange, making your transaction, normally instant.
The QR code scanner was giving issue's with scanning phone QR code's so a webcam is now being used.
Much smoother
@_date: 2014-04-10 14:08:53

@_date: 2013-12-28 16:17:19
I beleieve you got a response from one of the owners that they would fix it. But you were also given a reasonable answer.
They should send you the funds again? And than your original funds arrive and you double your btc?
How about you stop notching like a little girl. If my bank screws up. It's usually days to fix. Not 16 hours.
Stop ruining a companies rep because you don't understand the tech.
@_date: 2013-12-28 16:10:03

@_date: 2013-12-28 16:13:38

@_date: 2013-12-26 00:30:10
Not really. The only way to get ahead with btc is to preorder and hope to hell they ship on time. Anything in stock is way to over priced. Right now just buy as much coin as you can.
Mine source is an American reseller for black arrow. Likely your best bet to preorder. 
Realize the x3 is likely to generate 12-15 coins... And costs 6 grand... Safer to buy btc. Or casascius coins.
@_date: 2013-12-29 14:08:56
Again. Attacking spelling. See now after 24 hours I'd be on your side. As would others. But because you started this botch post after six. Many read it and wrote you off. Time to email or call the owners.

Now your arguing semantics.
The US gov. Owns a deal tonne of gold as a fall back.
Up until the early thirties gold was what backed the American dollar. Until the fed produced more money than they had gold. At which point it was federally backed. 
The USD is now backed by nothing. But a hope and a dream. It was at one point backed by gold.
Btc is backed by the users and businesses. I'd pit my money on USD flopping before btc

And attacking Canada's education system. Lol.
Your a joke lady. Treat everyone like this and see how far you get.
@_date: 2013-12-26 09:10:32
Sorry. That's where it originally came from. they've far exceeded that. But at one point the USD was a currency backed by gold. Which is why the federal reserve is full of it.
But seeing as how you have to fall back to insulting others.. It would seem you lack much knowledge to defend your own statement.
