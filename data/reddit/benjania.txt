I hope (and think) for you that will the case indeed, however these would really be considered a collectors item with very minimal liquidity and also you cannot break it up into smaller pieces. With bitcoin there is multiple billions of value being traded on exchanges worldwide

Exactly the point with the fed printing money non stop, in some way that is similar to the non stop flow of additional money through drops within Runescape.
You are right when speaking about gold, thats why the stock to flow model works for these kind of rare assets. Bitcoin however will way and way earlier reach its limit versus gold. but indeed, once all gold has been mined, similar price movements could be expected.

Well, then you should read my simple explanation and find out. This is a perfect example of what scarcity can do to values within an economic system:
 
**Partyhats** are obtained by opening [Christmas crackers]( dropped during the [2001 Christmas event]( There are six different coloured partyhats, all with the same shape and size (red, yellow, green, blue, purple, and white). When worn by a [player]( they resemble a crown. Because they are [discontinued]( they are very rare, much sought after and worth billions of [coins]( although they don't offer any stat bonuses. **These are currently the most valuable objects in** [***RuneScape***]( **Partyhats are used to hold large sums of cash, because the gold coin limit is 2.147B and these hats are gaining wealth over time.** Due to their rarity, these items hold a much higher [Street value]( than their value on the [Grand Exchange]( In [*Runescape Classic*]( the price of partyhats was drastically changed after players abused a glitch by creating many partyhats (see [Partyhat duplication glitch]( for more info.) Due to their high price, they have become recognised as a symbol of wealth in the game by players and non-player characters alike.
Over time, the volume of partyhats has been **diminishing.** The much smaller number of players when partyhats were released meant that not as many were acquired when available. Also, at the time of the release, partyhats were **virtually worthless**, meaning many players discarded them immediately. The majority of the few players who held onto them eventually quit *RuneScape* or were banned, **leaving the number of active players with partyhats at a very, very low number**.
**Surprisingly, partyhats do play a pivotal role in the** ***RuneScape*** **economy**. **Players will use these items as investments, cash placements, staked items, and collectables. They are used as cash holders for players because of the stability of the item**. Majority of partyhats are traded in world 2 around the grand exchange, but collectibles players wishing to buy or sell a partyhat may either have to advertise on the *RuneScape* forums, leave it in the Grand Exchange, or trade at much lower/higher prices to accommodate the few players that are willing to trade partyhats.

Our job to tell them that’s not how it works!

I have no doubt about that at all but possibly any of our friends who are not on this sub (yet) won't. For anyone that played this game (millions of peple) this could be a very easy bridge for them to "see the light".
