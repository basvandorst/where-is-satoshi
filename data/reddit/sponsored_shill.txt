So... you want to bring the gold standard back, But With Bitcoins?

Well, you pretty well capture the Bitcoin spirit with mines: only fun when you're on top.  We have the pre-mining phase where certain people get a little extra before launching to the masses:


Early adopters win out and have a serious interest in pumping as hard as they can.  Late arrivals can maybe score mines if a mineholder decides to sell them, but mainly serve to prop up the mineholders.  And, of course, mines could be lost forever by someone either quitting without caring, login disaster, or whatever.

It somewhat depends on what you mean by "adopting" a cryptocurrency.  Actually using bitcoin for 100% of the nation's money would be next to impossible to implement and would lead to either an ineffectual, broke government or just a complete collapse into AnCapistan (at which point you become easy pickings for any particularly ambitious neighbor).
For 100% adoption, first the nation needs to get its bitcoins in the first place.  They'd either have to buy them (your nation's buying its money off other nations), or join the competitive world of bitcoin mining, with all the budget of _________ for their mining rig to do so.  You'd also need coins for people to do their day to day life activities, so add that to the demand.
If the government deals in bitcoins, people probably want bitcoins.  That means they probably want their job giving them bitcoins.  Why would any corporation want to go through the particular hoop of paying employees in only one place bitcoins?  You're now asking every business that wants to do business with you to go through the above problem (at least they, unlike your fledgling nation, have money to buy coins with).
At the most generous estimate of 7 transactions a second, you now have several million people all trying to do day-to-day affairs.  How will important government-related transactions be guaranteed to through?  Exorbitant fees?  An economic attack of just clogging up the network is pretty expensive for individuals, but wouldn't be too out of reach for any developed nation, hell, just take a chunk of the defense budget to shit up the chain with junk transactions and suddenly Bitcoinitopia isn't able to spend anything.  Shit, if you have any double-digit amount of fast food drive-thrus across your lands you'll probably get some clogging up around lunchtime.

It's pretty simple.  If somebody uses bitcoins but doesn't need a locksmith, they aren't going to be giving you bitcoins for locksmithing services.  Likewise, if they're more interested in the value of their coins going up than spending them, they won't be giving anyone bitcoins period.

I rate that title Clickbait/10
"It'll make bitcoin more secure by having an honest connection be close to impossible to physically tamper with."
Note that no bitcoins are actually being launched into space yet, we have until 2016 for that.  Just some guy is starting up the idea of making Bit Satellites.

You're wanting them to do something for you, but are indignant when they have their own conditions as part of the deal.


It may not be your payment processor, but Coinbase is still an exchange and has to act like one.  What they actually are (and thus what rules they have to play by) is more important than what you want them to be for you.

No, assuming the guy had a hat or something else for the purpose of receiving spare change already, that's already an expected interaction.  If it was a guy playing guitar for the sake of playing guitar and somebody walked up and said "Hey, great music, I love it, have three cents", yes, that person is an asshole now because they changed the nature of the interaction and gave it a condescending, offensive value.


Yes, I actually would say don't tip at all.  Keep the nature of the interaction strictly social with no monetary exchange.  I'm not sure how it's difficult to grasp that giving people next to nothing as a "tiny token of appreciation" can be offensive and make the tipper look like a jackass.  It's something people in media do to be quickly written as unsympathetic: throw pennies at people while walking away with a laugh.

What's dramatic about this?  We were having a convo.  I made my opening snarky remark.  When you responded to it, I explained my position and why micro-tips could/would be seen as an insult (by the way, thanks for the satoshi.  Passive-aggressive, or was my remark worth 1 satoshi of appreciation to you?).  I don't understand why you're now going "fuck you" to me.

You decided the AMA of somebody who's been at the trial of the Silk Road case every day had value that could be translated into money, and the appropriate amount to give them for it was ten cents.  The message I read from that: This AMA is worth absolute jack shit, people throw dimes in the trash without worrying too hard about them.
Having one hundred people tell me "I'm going to put a price tag on your comment/content and the price I think it's worth is a nickel" doesn't make me feel any better now that I have $5.  It makes me pissed off at the "tippers" because I'm being told one hundred times my content, that was very likely a non-market-exchange social affair I wasn't expect anything for but is now Suddenly Priced, was worth basically nothing.  This is different than a downvote or a reply of "this content sucks", this is now a transaction where I'm given a condescending pittance.  What a bunch of assholes.  I'd have rather not been given anything at all.

We can hem and haw over percent differences and the mathematically rational logical correct thing to do, but at the end of the day a merchant who gets one or two BTC sales every so often and gives no fucks about decentralization or toppling the world governments or whatever likely just doesn't give enough of a shit.  They get a few extra sales they may or may not have gotten anyway, horray.
