It’s a protocol yes, in this case 1st layer.

There are worse consequences than those for bitcoin.

They haven’t. March/April shipping should start. They claim they will be the first ones to go live

You can use TenX as well, live product :) bitcoin, eth, dash, etc :)

Since they got a long waitlist it doesn’t even matter actually but you are right

It’s doesn’t really matter whether it’s meant to be a currency or an asset since they will work more or less like an decentralise exchange (COMIT).

Now everyone says it’s obvious the price surges that much.. look back some weeks people were devastated. Always apply some realism: it wasn’t that bad back then and it’s not that good right now. Take one day at a time and don’t overreact now by being extremely bullish and saying „I told you so“.

He made this prediction back in dec when btc was at 15-20k. He „predicted“ btc was going down to 5k and going up to 60k

Where did you try to signup, what makes you think it isn’t live? Live 100% sure for bitcoin. Eth and dash in Beta as far as I know
@_date: 2018-07-11 20:11:44
He said all of that back in December. When bitcoin was at 15-20k. He said it’s gonna bottom at 5k and gonna hit 60k. Both bold prediction with btc at 20k.

Everything is traded against bitcoin not vice versa.
