yes, but it is typical satellite internet, so slowish to kinda fast, depending on the weather and phase of the moon and sacrifices made.  Then the cap that knocks you down to dialup speed once you pass it by watching half a season of a show on hulu.
Not quite that bad, but you get the idea.

What a bunch of non-alcoholics here.  I love this dark spiced rum.  One of my favorites.

I really dislike how my trade fees doubled in the last few days since the unlimited plan went into effect.  For us small time traders, I can't even do anything now without losing money because of the fees.  Last week I could still trade in small amounts. No longer.  Kinda sucks.

[YOU NEVER GO FULL BITCOIN!](   
Toss in some litecoin and dogecoin while you are at it. :)

I'll just have to hold for now and wait it out I suppose.  Thanks for the news on that :)

I only buy in mBTC, as that's all I can afford :(
@_date: 2013-11-10 06:04:13
Currently, the best way to get BTC is to buy it.  Unless you want to lose money by mining.  You cannot make any profit by mining right now unless you have some *serious* money put into some serious ASIC chips.  CPU mining started costing money long ago, GPU mining is dead also.  I just got into btc last month, thought I had to mine but I was wrong.  The best thing to do is read threads on all the different subreddits.  As cool as it sounds to mine, it will only cost you money with zero returns.  Good luck.

Just thought I would tell you that I have you tagged as   
 "To the moon!!! ┗(°0°)┛" in the color maroon, because it kinda sounds like moon.  So when you comment,"To the moon!!! ┗(°0°)┛"   
I see:

A lot of us over here in the U.S. actually drink from 2L bottles.  I rarely do anymore since trying to get healthier, but it is not uncommon at all.  1L bottles are very common for personal consumption.  Increasingly common are the .5L bottles now that people are finally trying to get a bit healthier.
Edit: Forgot to mention that some brands even sell 3L bottles, and yes, I have seen many use them as personal sizes.

Thanks. I appreciate the information.

I missed the golden shower.
@_date: 2013-11-14 09:52:48
I ordered on Sat the 9th.  Funny thing, it said 4 days, then it changed to the 18th... *and* it took almost 6 business days to get my bank account verified. :(  It is nice they are doing the instant buy for new customers now.  If I were a normal average Joe, I would have been done with btc for good if I had to wait 2 weeks just to get .10
@_date: 2013-11-18 08:02:10
I am always so confused by change.

mine came in within the hour they said it would.  Waited ten days and this morning at 3:40 or so pst I got it
@_date: 2013-11-18 19:26:36
I also will buy one with btc if and when my .11 will be worth way more than the cost.  I wouldn't want a new car and not be able to pay insurance and registration etc on it.
@_date: 2013-11-07 10:29:39


Exactly this.
@_date: 2013-11-18 11:54:00
but you just gave a thousand dollars future money.  Nice tip right there.
@_date: 2013-10-22 07:39:27
Thanks for the reply.  I have looked into all of that.  I am looking for personal opinions from you guys.  Places you feel are good etc.  Some things you just cannot get from generic guides.  It's like going to buildapc instead of reading guides.  The people there can actually tell you what works irl instead of what works on paper.
EDIT: I of course am still looking through stuff, just trying to get more info :)
@_date: 2013-11-18 12:39:54
if you bought on coinbase, they will change that to 10 days.  at least that is what they keep doing to me since I dont have a visa to get level 2 verified.

Assuming this is a Large? I'd kinda like one to wear, but I am more of a 3x tall :)  
@_date: 2013-11-06 06:47:41
Don't know if it is related, but it took 5 days for their deposit just so i could get verified.  Maybe they are having some issues with slow banking system right now?
@_date: 2013-11-16 02:52:15
Been waiting since the 9th for mine.  Which I guess is normal?  I don't think an average Joe would care to wait that long to get into bitcoin though.

Glad you got a bunch of good information! I needed a lot of this myself.  I asked the questions along the same line a couple weeks ago, but no one really wanted to help.   It always helps me to learn when different people give their understanding of things.  Thanks for asking the question. :)

Very.  Just nervously talking about a bunch of drug dealers, child pornographers, and hackers who use virtual currency.  Why is she so nervous?

I have lived all over Michigan and pretty much everyone I know does it or used to.  Only takes one hand if you do it right, then you get a nice callous between your base index finger joint and the middle joint. :) It has been such a common occurrence in my 31 years I never had any idea people had never seen it before. TIL.

I really love how she has all these words but isn't really saying anything other than criminals and normal people both use blah blah blah
