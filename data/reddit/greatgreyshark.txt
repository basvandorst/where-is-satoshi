Worthless? it´s worth something, and it can be used
Bitcoin: It´s worth something, and it CANT be used.

I don´t know what you on about, carry on Hodling your 0.08 Bitcoin.
So please tell me how the world will make a fair wealth distribution across countries with a limited amount of Bitcoin?
We´re rich people/miners have total monopoly on the currency

Oh ffs.. Bitcoin has a finite number of coins.. but inflation &gt; devaluation is the same thing.
Deflationary Bitcoin does not not make it immune to PRICE DROPS, and sure as hell does not guarantee price increase for eternity.
If you have 10k USD Fiat, and inflation bla bla = its now 9,800 USD
If you have 1 BTC which you bought at 10k, and is 1 year later worth 5k.. well there you go 50% less value vs 2% less value.
Fiat, printing money, inflation .. stimulates economies, loans and investments.. makes the money go around.

Winklevoss Twins or Warren Buffett and the other army of hedge fund managers.. yes the kind of people that are actually making a fortune from chart/price.. on stocks commodities currencies are all more or less BUBBLE SIDED on bitcoin.
Winklevoss who? marketeers

Because i worry about the poor, because i worry what would happen if a 100% annon. currency would rule the world?
With a few 0.1% of the population owning almost all of it? 
Because i really want to know, you seem like an offended teenage daughter.
@_date: 2017-12-31 02:04:34
So what? If 10 individuals sit on 10% of all BCoin
And 1,000 Individuals sit on 51% of all BCoin.. 
"Well Africa we are sorry you could not afford those GPU´s to mine, nor the capital to buy bitcoin when they where cheap... yea yea i get it you where to busy paying back debt to our 1st world countries and providing necessary food for the starving people"

Do you know mr "i dont even own bitcoin" 
That the fall from 19k to 11k is equal to about 15-20 years of inflation in 2 days? 
Devaluation and inflation, lets sing a song... you know why? because new cryptos keep fighting for that dumb money market cap thats pouring in, from 92% in 2013 to under 39% today.. 
USD dont compete with new "word currencies" 
It´s just a game of greed under the disguise of "Good Guy Currency, free of Illuminati banks"
@_date: 2017-12-31 03:12:29
Must suck owning 0.03 bitcoins and realizing that the ever falling market cap 39%&lt;, and the ever rising fee´s are crushing your dreams of 1,000,000USD/1BTC.. so you can finally move out from that basement you live in ;)
I have no time from pretentious people without any arguments or facts to provide on the topic.
"ou're letting a emotion-driven narrative about an imaginary future with immense bitcoin wealth inequality prevent you from having an actual discussion or, God forbid, learning anything."
Just this BS right there, made me cringe real hard.
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:56:17
LOOOOOOOL, go light a joint kid..you´ll never be rich anyways.
Btw your thread stinks, i just owned you with more wealthier people against BTC
@_date: 2017-12-31 02:19:08
Sheez... im just giving an argument that "market cap" means nothing.
Google did not need a 100bil market cap before it was deemed a success..
@_date: 2017-12-31 03:21:22
"you are wrong in this and that, because i say so"
Get lost please ;)
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:57:42
Actually its 600bil peak, not trillion.
And 80% of that is new money, from this year alone.
Crypto´s been around for 9 years, people pumping up the price this year is pure speculators for the quick buck.
So telling me something is "working right" "is amazing"
By using "new money" - market cap as some kind of proof, go watch Enron documentary.
There you´ll see how 100+ bil market caps can vanish in 2 days.
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:59:54
Right, so what does these Satoshi help?
If 0.1% of the population sit on 80% of the worlds money..
Isn´t the point with currencies to make it fair, and balanced.

ok princess, i´ll come back when my research indicates
"Bitcoin will take over the world"
