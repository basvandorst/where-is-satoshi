I still do see it as standing still, compared to recent months we've been flat-line for some time now :S
@_date: 2014-01-07 16:45:56
Not completely:
Why am I downvoted for pointing out that it's not down?
@_date: 2014-01-14 12:16:43
It's not that hard to mine on p2pool without setting up your own node, cause there's plenty of nodes already ( People can even mine on my node if they use a bitcoin address as the username:
bfgminer -o p2pool.allyourbasearebelongto.me.uk:9332/ -u somebitcoinaddress -p whatever
Although I have the fee set to 2% which is probably pretty high :D

He can't be *that* Satoshi because **I** am *that* Satoshi.

If my understanding is right, you only get paid when a block is found within around 24 hours of your last share (it's actually a number of p2pool shares but it's about 24 hours).
The share difficulty is very high and my 30GH only generates about 1 share a day, the pool finds on average around 2 blocks a day (although it's been nearly 2 days since the last block now), so I *should* generally get paid twice a day on average.
If you're a low hash rate miner it may take months for you to get one single share, but then you'll probably get two reasonably high payouts when blocks are found afterwards.
With normal pool mining you get many more regular smaller payouts instead of very sporadic larger payouts.
Variance I think is the generally accepted term.
Otherwise, yeah, it's just a different pool address on the command line. Apparently a lot of FGPA hardware doesn't work well, my BFL ASIC seems to work fine though.

Yes, completely.
Custom 404 message.
@_date: 2014-01-03 21:47:16
Yes. It's ace.

I don't know about banking where you are but where I am banks are offering interest rates WAY below inflation unless you invest in fixed term bonds.
@_date: 2014-06-17 15:25:58
I've pointed my miner at it. My own P2Pool node is a little skittish.
@_date: 2014-06-17 16:05:45
:) Fingers crossed for some good luck!
My last share is getting preeetty old...
@_date: 2014-07-01 14:43:08
I just happened to be listening to Pets by deadmau5 when I clicked the image, made me smile.
@_date: 2014-01-07 16:45:24
This works though, just the index page missing
@_date: 2014-09-25 13:55:58
Sure, but a flexible investment that beats inflation is better than an inflexible one, that way you can reassess you're investments more regularly for the best return. It's all relative, factors such as risk and flexibility need to be taken into account.
For clarity, all I'm saying is its not as simple as to say "just put it in a bank", these things take a lot of consideration.
@_date: 2014-10-02 18:46:38
It might not have worked by the way, it doesn't for me. Open bug already logged.
@_date: 2014-11-27 14:54:50
Not being legally a currency does not make Bitcoin illegal, it just makes it not a currency.
@_date: 2014-03-03 16:53:27
Nice to see an official word on this :)
@_date: 2014-01-09 19:44:46
Epic news :D Can't wait for international rollout!
@_date: 2014-10-12 15:20:05
But just how many internets are there?
@_date: 2014-03-25 15:07:38
I use it.
@_date: 2014-03-07 20:13:06
Agreed, I've made my small contribution (and feel happy that it will always be recorded in the blockchain).
@_date: 2014-06-13 15:19:56
I'm back on p2pool again. I didn't mine on Gigahash anyway but hey, p2pool is how the cool kids mine... The cooler kids solo mine but I'm just not *that* cool.
@_date: 2014-03-24 20:46:46
I do this but with AirVPN
@_date: 2015-04-29 11:31:19
I don't even think it's true for deposits to an exchange, last time I tried to send EUR via SEPA Barclays wanted to charge me £15 I think.
Just use circle with a visa debit card.
@_date: 2015-04-29 13:32:25
Weird, mine always works. 
@_date: 2015-03-25 14:22:08
I use their prepaid cards to buy stuff in the UK. This makes me happy indeed!
@_date: 2015-03-20 22:51:31
The packaging of mine (sent to UK) was totally trashed and one sticker was off. Surprised the thing managed to stay in the package!
@_date: 2015-02-13 21:20:30
Love this wallet, so I've sent you a donation with the old version before it gets updated :) Thanks for all the hard work!
@_date: 2013-12-16 21:27:05
So I sell a few because of this. Immediately it goes back up. I give up... Again...
@_date: 2013-09-23 21:53:54
Hmm, that sucks. I'll send a complaint to bitpay. Not holding my breath!
@_date: 2013-12-06 17:03:45
Hopefully they just class it as any other investment where capital gains is due once you're over your capital gains allowance.
@_date: 2013-12-16 22:10:54
This is just ridiculous. I know what will happen if I buy them back.
@_date: 2013-04-22 21:44:08
I was gonna say millibit too. Sounds good to me :)
@_date: 2013-12-30 22:46:47
Yep. My little single works just fine thanks :)
@_date: 2013-04-04 06:59:48
I had the same problem last night, between my own stupidity and the blockchain android client strangeness I managed to send to another address of mine all but 0.0005 of my balance without a TX fee, meaning it might never confirm due to the miniscule output. I downloaded my block chain wallet, loaded it into multibit and sent the transaction again properly with the fee and all the output to my other address as originally intended and the new TX went through almost straight away. I don't know what happens to the old transaction but blockchain knows it was a double spend. It'll probably just die. It's all fine right now though!
@_date: 2013-12-16 22:56:21
Well I was planning to buy back for less. Which looks like I'll be able to do, but not for as much profit as I had hoped!
@_date: 2013-12-16 21:54:17
Sold some more. You know. Just to keep it going up :)
@_date: 2013-12-19 20:58:03
This isn't even funny. They can just block things they don't like! Arseholes!
@_date: 2013-03-09 23:03:26
Agreed. I was trading at this time and it was seriously lagging and confusing, but not frozen. My transactions were lagging by 15 minutes or around there. The lagging and confusion was what caused a drop.
@_date: 2013-10-18 15:49:37
Didn't know this lot existed, thanks :)
@_date: 2013-12-23 17:00:12
Agreed, I was about to post the same.
@_date: 2013-12-19 23:53:16
Thankfully I have the power to get my internet elsewhere.
@_date: 2013-04-22 13:24:59
Done this :D
Fantastic news!
@_date: 2013-12-22 14:16:11
I'm going to use this :)
@_date: 2013-12-20 11:14:40
Sent you a gift via reddit mail :)
@_date: 2013-04-16 07:07:24
On a positive note... Gox isn't lagging under all this trade volume!
@_date: 2013-09-18 16:07:53
Dang, I just ordered a card, hope this is still alive! Did you get yours?
@_date: 2013-03-22 21:41:59
I thought it 'popped' last week... Wait a sec...
@_date: 2013-05-03 21:11:43
How does this jump vast un-populated spaces (oceans…)?
NVM, got it :) How do I get one :D
@_date: 2013-12-21 09:35:00
And to you :D
@_date: 2013-04-01 18:41:33
I don't see it either. Not in Finch, Twitter, or Reddit Is Fun.
@_date: 2013-10-25 08:44:35
I use armory. Trying out Hive, anyone know how you backup a hive wallet?
@_date: 2013-03-22 21:59:15
Plenty of opportunities to buy slightly lower from those with no balls :)
@_date: 2013-12-06 17:01:38
It makes it hard to run a UK based exchange if they have to charge 20% VAT. That's my take on why it's good news...
@_date: 2013-12-16 23:23:30
Why is it always "desperate" with you people? It's not life or death!
@_date: 2013-12-23 17:21:03
I'm working on it. I can tell you that you're looking at the back of it :)
@_date: 2013-03-25 15:07:26
Yep :)
@_date: 2013-03-07 16:32:44
I sold some near the top and bought them back plus a little more at the bottom :) Only pocket change though, bit of an experiment. It's basically impossible to react when MtGox is lagging so much.
@_date: 2013-12-20 09:30:11
I'll try and get back to you :D
Worked for me.
I love paying with BTC :D
@_date: 2013-03-09 23:07:14
For example I ended up putting up a market rate sell eventually because every time I set a price by the time my ask was actually live it was well above the market rate. I managed to buy back lower though so was OK but I could have made a bunch more out of it.
