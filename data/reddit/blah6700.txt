No, you will need to report to them who the owner of the wallet is, i.e. yourself.

Perhaps.  Just because it ridiculous, burdensome and approaching impossible does not mean it can't become the law.
@_date: 2018-05-09 13:43:33
What storm?
@_date: 2018-05-21 21:20:46
Actually, it is not.  It is not a US Government agency as you erroneously claimed in your title.  Here's hoping that you are not from the US.

Standard economics.  Putting almost 1 million BTC into play would have instant and extreme consequences.
@_date: 2018-05-23 17:05:09
That's the slowest method and most dangerous method.   Trading between BTC and alts is far more safe and rapid.   I've accumulated 15 times more BTC than I bought with fiat and hold an equal amount in alts.  Far more predictable and safe and you'll never get caught with your pants down, holding fiat while BTC skyrockets.

Are you new to Bitcoin or something?
@_date: 2018-05-21 21:18:13
I remember, before /bitcoin sucked, when the price of bitcoin was far from the most popular topic.
@_date: 2018-05-23 16:50:12
What does that have to do with whether you sell or not?
@_date: 2018-05-09 00:05:32
Yeah, so you're new.  You've only witnessed two of these cycles now.
@_date: 2018-05-23 16:47:07
Moving a bitcoin would crash the market.
@_date: 2018-05-21 21:22:38
It has nothing to do with the US Government, or any US government agency.
@_date: 2018-05-21 21:19:58
Too bad it is not a US government agency.  OP fail.
@_date: 2018-05-02 16:13:47


Incorrect.  It's fundamental value is derived by the need to pay taxes in a nation's fiat currency.  That value (demand) is backed by force, not belief.

Do it carefully, but you can follow these instructions from Electrum.  First step is to import your keys to an Electrum *Bitcoin* wallet.  However, read and understand everything before you proceed.  Note: Is is very important that you spend/send your Bitcoins from your wallet/keys *before* importing to Electron Cash, or any other Bitcoin Cash wallet.
Recommendation on how to redeem Bitcoin Cash
July 31st, 2017.
Electrum is a Bitcoin wallet created by Thomas Voegtlin in 2011.
Electrum is distributed by Electrum Technologies GmbH, a company
registered in Germany, using the website 
Electrum users who are not interested in Bitcoin Cash do not need to
worry nor to take any particular action. The following note is only
for users who want to access their Bitcoin Cash (BCC).
"Electron Cash" is a fork of Electrum for Bitcoin Cash. Electron Cash
is not endorsed by Electrum. It is open source, and binaries
(executables files) are available for Windows, OSX and
Android. However, when you run binaries instead of source code, you
have no guarantee that they match the source code. This is why wallet
binaries are usually signed by developers. A digital signature engages
the responsability of the person who signs.
The person who distributes the Electron Cash binaries has decided to
remain anonymous, and uses the fake name "Jonald Fyookball" in order
to sign Electron Cash binaries. Thus, if these binaries contain code
that is designed to steal your bitcoins, the author of the theft will
be anonymous and walk away safely with your funds.
This danger is exacerbated by the fact that the default behaviour of
Electron Cash is to silently copy all your Electrum wallets into its
own directory. Thus, if you run Electron Cash on a machine where you
previously used Electrum, all your pre-existing wallets will be
available in Electron Cash, and you will only need to enter your
password in order to expose your bitcoins to potential theft.
Therefore, users who want to run the Electron Cash binaries should do
it on a separate same machine, that does not have their Bitcoin
wallet. We recommend to proceed as follows:
 1. Install Electron Cash on a machine that does not have your
 Electrum wallets.
 2. Wait until the BCC hard fork has taken place, and a few BCC blocks
 have been mined.
 3. Move all your Electrum funds to a new Electrum wallet. This will
 move only your BTC, and not your BCC, because the BCC blockchain has
 replay protection. Wait until the transaction is confirmed.
 4. Enter the seed of your (now empty) old wallet or private keys in
 Electron Cash. Since the BTC have been moved to a new wallet,
 entering your old seed in Electron Cash will not put your BTC funds
 at risk.
Following these 4 easy steps you will be able to access your BCC
without compromising your BTC.

An exchange hack is nothing.   It is only because it's moving down that it served as a rational for a small panic.  When it's on it's way up, an exchange hack is generally inconsequential.
@_date: 2018-06-13 13:28:13
How would they even accomplish that?

If the pattern holds, it should slowly descend to around $4000.

Seriously.  What reality are these people living in?   Bitcoin is up over 260% from last year and people feel as though the price is down.  And, historically, Bitcoin makes drastic upward movements by increasing by 1200% to 2000% and then pulling back 40% to 60% before finding a new stable price stable.  Very predictable (so far).  Not sure why there is surprise and angst each time.
@_date: 2018-06-06 16:38:01
Can you bring me up to speed?  I'm not sure what you're referring to.
@_date: 2018-06-06 16:34:55
Don't forget that many also have buy limit orders at $5,000.
@_date: 2018-06-12 13:46:35
I'm basing it off nothing but the similarity I felt between the run-up to $20,000 and the run-up, in 2013, to $1160'ish.  After the 2013 run-up, the price slowly descended by 80%, to ~$215,  over a period of a year.  At that point it plateaued for another year, and slowly rose, finally reaching a new high *3 years* after reaching the previous high.   The equivalent for the $20,000 run-up would be a slow decline to $4000, plateauing for an equal amount of time and then rising and surpassing $20,000 after an equal period of time.
@_date: 2018-06-07 23:37:13
That's not a lack of volatility at all.   You are deluding yourself, unless you are also arguing that Bitcoin was more mature, from late 2013 to early 2017, than it is now.   That was over 3 years without breaking a new high.
@_date: 2018-06-06 14:07:09
It really doesn't depend on entry price.  Anybody buying above the current price and surprised by the predictable pullback either is obliviously new to Bitcoin or simply hasn't been paying attention to its price behavior.
@_date: 2018-06-07 23:32:29
Why would it *all* go into Bitcoin?

It's already been done and only confused and made it more difficult to get new people to buy in.

It's already been done.  It made it harder.

You're treating Bitcoin, whatever what form it takes, like some deity that should receive blind devotion and gratitude.

Bitcoin became more and more decentralized in its youth.  I'm not sure what your argument is predicated on.  Are you maintaining that the current tendency toward decentralization is proof that it will always tend towards decentralization?

Mainly, it is because Blockchain.info's fee algorithm is way off base by a factor of 15.  A fee of 0.00081 BTC would have gotten the transaction confirmed in the next block.
@_date: 2018-04-16 18:37:44
No.  You charging the equivalent of $8000/hr is the delusion.
@_date: 2017-05-31 15:45:02
While the fees are high, Blockchain.info's algorithm is way off.  Currently, as well as when this was submitted, a fee of 0.00081 BTC will get it confirmed in the first block, with no delays.  The "small" fee that you had chosen, more than 2x the necessary fee, would have effectively put you at the top of the heap.
