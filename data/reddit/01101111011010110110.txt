I agree with larger blocks, but xt is too extreme.
@_date: 2015-12-02 11:53:35
I'm afraid of one coin only.
@_date: 2015-12-26 22:55:53
every altcoin can just turn bitcoin as a sidechain.
@_date: 2015-12-31 04:12:52
I don't think we will see a solution which scales more than the next 5-10 years. (but that's ok for me)
@_date: 2015-12-22 13:19:25
it's not hard to grow more in % compared to btc.
@_date: 2015-12-22 13:05:01
i hope we will see the clean version
@_date: 2016-01-09 14:39:17
you can send transactions through the tor network or any public wireless lan. I think mining centralization is a much bigger issue.
@_date: 2016-01-04 18:01:00
is there no library?
@_date: 2016-01-29 14:57:51
war on cash will next for sure, then qe-infinite. i have the feeling that this crap system could life longer than we like.
@_date: 2016-01-29 05:05:11


  
it is the most secure sha256-blockchain (i do not know how to really compare it to other hashing methods, can anybody help me with this?) at the moment, but only as long as the chinese government doesn't feel treated from bitcoin. so i wouldn't bet about the future outcome.
@_date: 2016-01-22 19:19:53
tor traffic increased every year. many people I know use it to surf the web for legal things.
@_date: 2016-01-06 04:41:00
- tx malle is easy to prevent (it's better to have this fixed, but I wouldn't call it an issue).  
- ln and sidechains will not get as big as some people think.

a good attorney will burn all the remaining money, they also have to pay their bills.
@_date: 2016-01-15 18:49:30
what should they do? quit business?
@_date: 2016-01-19 17:28:53
or thanks to all this mess we will never (or for a long time not) see a new ath.
@_date: 2016-01-09 14:36:48
china government has to seize mining operations of 10 people and the price of btc will be zero again. btc cannot grow that big, it's more likely that we have many altcoins with small market cap and thousands of gpu miners until we found a fix to the crazy mining centralization.
@_date: 2016-01-11 06:35:18
it's more like you show the vendor 10 bucks (but not saying to give him these) and he gives you the product (without saying it costs 10 bucks). so you go home and one day later he screams fraud.
@_date: 2015-09-22 08:21:52
next generation could argue like you: "50% of all bitcoins mined in only 4 years? that's not fair, we never had this opportunity." I hope they will not
@_date: 2015-11-15 23:00:45
most mixing services cost ~2%. it's cheaper, faster and more secure to go through CN coins like xmr.
@_date: 2015-11-15 11:37:39
government agencies already partnered with blockchain research. have a look at 
@_date: 2015-11-08 01:36:38
I have not read any issue about them, yet. In comparison: cryptsy had issues since 2 years, from negative balances to withdrawl issues to closed accounts after 6 month inactivity. So bitfinex is maybe safe.
@_date: 2015-11-15 23:04:48
there is the same issue I see with sidechains: if I have to use another chain, why do I ever have to go back to btc? it's not user friendly.
@_date: 2015-11-15 22:56:59
great idea but I assume we would need hundeds or maybe thousands of transactions to mix all these btc good enough. and the software has to work flawless. I think build in privacy is the way to go, not solving this issue on top of the protocol.
@_date: 2015-11-14 21:08:37
do you really think that we will see things like privacy in bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-11-03 01:07:19
Yes, I am. I think most blocks are full in the next 2-6 month. If we see a bubble then before that. Shorters will probably fuck up the price again.
@_date: 2015-10-10 08:22:32
cryptonote. first coin which used the protocol was bytecoin but it was premined. most used is monero. (afaik)
@_date: 2015-11-12 16:23:25
privacy is the main issue of bitcoin. I think the blocksize limit will get solved but I'm sure we will never see good privacy.
@_date: 2015-11-15 15:11:23
You have to trust the mixing service, that's the main issue.  
I think many use btc-e and other free/cheap deposit/withdrawl services which don't need to know their customer.  
If you are paranoid, I would recommend you:  
btc (e.g. shapeshift.io) -&gt; xmr -(send them with high mixin count to you again)-&gt; xmr -&gt; btc (e.g. xmr.to)
@_date: 2015-10-23 15:10:37
that's right. I didn't mean the address, more the input. so if you send me tainted/'bad' coins and I use them in another transaction, then the whole transaction is tainted because I'm using money from a criminal source. If they bust a drug dealer they seize all his money not only the fraction of his drug business.
@_date: 2015-10-25 21:30:17
I'm missing decentralized exchanges.
@_date: 2015-10-10 18:05:26
"...resulting in you getting back coins possibly related to drugs, stolen money or other practices you might not want to be involved in."
@_date: 2015-10-23 15:32:44
they will not go to zero. they will get seized as soon as you send them to an exchange and they will sell them again.
@_date: 2015-10-13 17:22:52
I haven't read BIP62 and I do not know if it's completely designed yet. I only said that the simplest solution would need a hard-fork (afaik). Correct me if I'm wrong. I only hope that BIP62 is not a crazy workaround. The protocol has to be simple imo.
@_date: 2015-10-13 17:18:32
Huh? I'm not a mod.
@_date: 2015-10-13 09:33:34
it would be ok for me.
we do not need all this kyc bullshit. mycelium has a build in local-trader, face2face works fine. and localbitcoins also.
@_date: 2015-11-15 11:58:29
shhh... let them believe
@_date: 2015-10-17 02:03:37
a little bit harder? I tried it to install to be a liquidy provider but I had to give up.
@_date: 2015-10-13 09:29:03
but it's easy to roll out a hardfork every 2 years if it's reasonable. we cannot look 20 years into the future
@_date: 2015-10-29 12:38:05
mycelium local trader
@_date: 2015-10-23 08:02:32
ofc the whole address will be tainted, because the owner is a criminal.
@_date: 2015-10-23 07:33:22
this. someone has to leak them first. money is already gone at this time.
@_date: 2015-11-15 22:48:42
but government make no difference between clean and drug money if they catch a drug dealer. I don't know how they will handle a transaction like this but I assume they have the right to seize the btc.
@_date: 2015-11-25 09:12:57
you can create the raw tx and broadcast it via blockchain.info's onion page.
