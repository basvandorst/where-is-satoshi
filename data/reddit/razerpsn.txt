And what happened? did you sell them for usd?
@_date: 2017-12-29 01:02:12
Can't withdraw since a week! Get your stuff together! Ticket 
@_date: 2018-09-10 18:13:08
Sorry if it's a stupid question. But I'm willing to work on improving the crypto UX as a way to increase mass adoption
Do you guys have any idea whom should I contact?
@_date: 2018-09-14 10:28:15
Incredibile how fast you can move from "Bitcoin Jesus" to "Bitcoin Devil"
@_date: 2019-03-19 13:01:44
Why? considering the current base fee is 1 satoshi per byte
@_date: 2019-03-21 13:54:52
Thanks! do you have a lightning wallet?
@_date: 2019-03-21 10:57:58
I've downloaded it from the official website using this command
git clone -b v0.17.1  
@_date: 2019-03-05 12:46:06
Guys which transaction fees should one use when paying with BTC in stores?
Aren't low fees supposed to be a risk because the payer could resend the same coins to a different address with a higher fee?
@_date: 2019-03-05 13:50:49
What if I plan to sell jewelry for example? what would be the best thing to do  in that scenario?
@_date: 2018-10-08 18:13:10
Can you explain how to do it? is it easy?
@_date: 2018-10-08 11:38:00
Yes, that's what I stated, if you're not actually a receiver or a payer, I'm not sure setting up a lightning node is useful
@_date: 2018-10-04 12:54:25
Why don't you just connect one of the existing nodes on the main net?
@_date: 2018-10-01 12:35:19
Guys any recommended wallet for iOS with Segwit support?
@_date: 2018-10-08 14:51:48
According to this site the port is open
Config file:
@_date: 2018-10-14 17:07:28
Anyone using Bitcoin in ubuntu? I've got it installed via PPA, but I'm not sure how to upgrade to latest version downloaded from the [bitcoin.org]( website
@_date: 2018-10-08 13:48:13
Yes 8333 is open, but my bitcoin.conf is empty
May that be the issue?
@_date: 2018-10-08 15:28:23
Weird, but glad it got it fixed for me, thanks for helping
The only issue it's I can't reach it via this website, but still I'm happy AF :)
@_date: 2018-10-08 15:05:38
It's already synced to latest block unfortunately
@_date: 2018-10-08 15:05:13
The port is open, websites confirmed It, but still 
@_date: 2018-10-03 19:49:10
I would like to test Lightning, any good main net app for iOS?
@_date: 2018-10-08 13:54:42
Guys I want to contribute to the newton but I'm having issues with a bitcoin node, port 8333 is open, but I can't get any more than 8 connections
@_date: 2018-10-08 15:08:24
Hey seems like I did it, setting -port=8333 did the trick, wasn't that the default one?
@_date: 2018-10-06 13:27:40
Guys how to use a dynamic DNS for a bitcoin/lightning node?
@_date: 2018-10-08 13:59:53
I've set them up now but it's the same, still 8 connections
Can they be normal logins? like "asd" user and "asd120" password?
@_date: 2018-10-03 20:17:09
Here is another one, more updated
@_date: 2018-10-04 23:04:20
Guys which one would you recommend between GDAX/Coinbase and Bitstamp?
Trying to move on from Kraken since it uses Tether
@_date: 2018-10-08 14:10:14
I think it's a port issue, I've tested with a website, and it stated it's open one time, now it says it's closed, I don't understand why
@_date: 2018-10-08 15:38:59
Hey would you help me with the node? I already have lightningd set up, how can I lower fees? should I just connect to a few channels and let it run?
@_date: 2018-10-02 01:58:26
@_date: 2018-10-08 21:02:42
Thanks guys, I've fixed setting -port=8333, not sure why, but still
I'm part of the contributing community now
Let's make this happen :)
@_date: 2017-08-25 10:24:30
So still no dump uh? i've been waiting for ages
@_date: 2018-10-05 00:25:25

Hey I just finished installing the bitcoin core node, after it syncs I'll install the LND node too, if you wish to connect to my node just shoot me a PM
@_date: 2018-10-03 20:06:42
Hello fellow bitcoiner! Have you checked out this list? it seems there's a few not requiring your own node
@_date: 2018-10-04 15:47:55
Any good tutorial to update on Ubuntu? I’ve installed core via ppa previously 
@_date: 2018-10-07 20:42:48
Is it useful even if you don't pay? I mean, will others connect to your node automatically?
@_date: 2018-10-08 13:25:03
I'm still having problems with the btc node, can't get more than 8 connection, once done I'll try again with lightning
@_date: 2018-10-08 14:22:22
Ah ok, the port is open now
Still 8 connections
Do i have to set this in the conf?
@_date: 2019-10-09 13:52:40
Then what could have caused this sudden decrease in bandwidth?
@_date: 2019-10-09 15:55:08
is there any documentation about this?
My VPN won't open port 8333, would port forwarding another port to 8333 be helpful?
@_date: 2019-10-09 17:09:11
I've set up tor hidden service. Now? Do i need to use 8333 as default port on Bitcoin core?
Which port do i have to forward on the VPN service?
@_date: 2019-10-15 09:47:45
I have a spare account i don't use anymore, i would like to give it t someone helping the network
@_date: 2019-10-15 08:31:52
That's the problem
@_date: 2019-10-15 10:42:09
So what would you suggest? give it to a developer or something?
@_date: 2019-10-09 20:55:28
Thanks mate! do you have a lightning wallet?
@_date: 2019-10-09 18:35:35
It seems to be working when the VPN is down, when it is up i cannot get more than 8 connections
@_date: 2019-10-09 20:56:18
Do you have a lightning wallet? if yes i'll tip you :)
@_date: 2019-10-05 11:29:20
I was considering Bisq,  but BTC prices are slightly higher
@_date: 2019-02-14 14:34:52
How can they afford the 5% discount?
@_date: 2019-10-09 19:31:03
Still can't get proper connection, but i'll give it some time
Last question for today, should i set the proxy in Bitcoin QT settings? (i see there's two proxy settings) or should i expect Bitcoin core software to pick Tor automatically?
@_date: 2019-06-11 11:37:20
Anyone using futures? should I use them? is there any advantage over normal trading?
@_date: 2019-06-14 11:15:51
Yeah I've tried to re-broadcast it already via accelerators but it didn't work, so I guess I'll wait now. Thanks
@_date: 2019-10-10 11:14:02
You're the man! do you have a lightning wallet? i'll tip you
@_date: 2019-10-09 18:27:51
I have done that but it won't accept incoming connection
Which port should i forward on my VPN provider?
@_date: 2019-06-14 13:09:22
It’s not currently visible on explorers, it says transaction not found
@_date: 2019-10-09 19:15:03
From what i can see from this tutorial 
I have to enable the proxy on Bitcoin QT, i can choose the port "9050", i would guess changing that and enabling port forwarding via VPN provider would fix the issue, am i wrong?
@_date: 2019-06-14 13:08:36
Imported the wallet in Electrum but I don’t see a replace by fee option
@_date: 2019-02-11 20:27:37
!lntip 20
@_date: 2019-06-14 10:50:15
I have a stuck transaction that's been like this for 3 days. How long until the payment goes back to the original wallet if not confirmed?
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:57:02
Be afraid, i used that option and it's been 24 hours without confirmations
@_date: 2019-02-02 02:09:27
!lntip 30
@_date: 2019-04-06 12:18:41
Mine reached 60 today for the first time, moved it to 100 but I'm afraid it will impact network performance
@_date: 2019-04-30 11:51:28
Too bad no iOS client
@_date: 2019-04-21 18:36:47
When can i import seeds from other wallets?
@_date: 2019-04-06 11:25:19
Any suggested number for max connections of my Bitcoin node?
@_date: 2018-11-18 12:28:31
Any good tutorial to set up a lightning node on Ubuntu? I want to help
@_date: 2018-11-26 02:17:43
Done the same, but haven't found a really good tutorial for LN on Ubuntu
@_date: 2019-01-01 01:25:41
Not sure I deserve that kind fella! But thanks :)
BTW tried running lightningd with a pruned node and it crashed after a while 
@_date: 2019-01-26 10:23:19
Thanks man! :D
@_date: 2019-01-13 14:29:46
There is this app that does all the work, only for Windows and Mac though [
On Linux it is a little bit more complicated
@_date: 2019-01-04 14:18:15
Are you stalking me around? :)
@_date: 2019-01-26 15:56:11
Thanks! :D
@_date: 2019-01-26 08:12:16
Anyone familiar with lightning?
I keep getting "No channels have sufficient incoming capacity" error when trying to create an invoice
@_date: 2019-01-03 09:22:30
Anyone having issue with Bitcoin nodes? Since two days I can't get more than 9 connections (was fine before)
@_date: 2019-01-04 14:04:02
Regarding lightning fees, any suggestion as:
fee-base=100  
@_date: 2019-01-13 14:16:55
What's recommended for a lightning node, c-lightning or lightningd?
@_date: 2019-01-08 20:47:04
On iOS there is no good alternative for Lightning 
@_date: 2019-01-04 14:54:17
Nah i was just kidding because because he already tipped me a few days ago :)
@_date: 2019-01-05 00:59:24
Thanks! very helpful
@_date: 2019-01-26 10:07:02
Thanks this is a really great reply!
@_date: 2019-01-03 18:39:40
How did you get the pruning to work? I thought LND din't support it
@_date: 2018-02-12 13:45:23
Send them back to me, I'm willing to give you one whole bitcoin. That's a real deal :)
@_date: 2018-02-15 19:31:17
What would you recommend?
@_date: 2017-10-10 12:55:25
I've lost over 200 ETH to a scam, and having harsh comments on Reddit was probably even worse than losing the money itself
So what i've got to tell you is just this, life goes on, try to recover and move on, even if it's not easy
Love from Italy
@_date: 2018-07-08 20:31:13
Thanks sir!
@_date: 2019-09-26 15:45:50
Thinking about getting another VPN service with port forwarding
What's the point of running a node without incoming connections?
@_date: 2019-09-26 15:56:21
Would you recommend any VPN provider that allows port forwarding?
@_date: 2019-09-26 15:46:17
Will this work even if my VPN provider does not support port forwarding?
@_date: 2019-09-26 16:48:40
I don't use it as a wallet, i just want to help the network
@_date: 2018-07-08 19:20:17
Guys a security question. Do you store your coins in just one wallet, or do you have a few just in case something happens to one of those?
@_date: 2018-07-08 20:09:13
Yes but as you know exchanges save your withdrawal address for you to re-use.
Usually you have to change it manually before the withdrawal if you want to
@_date: 2017-05-14 21:53:46
You're a dope dad, congrats
@_date: 2018-12-23 22:53:26
Hello my friend, did you disable upnp on the bitcoin software?
@_date: 2018-12-31 23:08:09
Does lightningd work with pruned nodes?
@_date: 2018-12-23 22:53:55
What's the easiest tutorial to run a Lightning node on Ubuntu?
@_date: 2018-12-24 13:03:55
Try to set the port in the settings file
@_date: 2018-12-02 13:54:10
Which software supports pruning on Lightning network?
@_date: 2019-05-11 19:35:31
How can you lose everything? shouldn't it liquidate your assets before you go to 0?
@_date: 2018-12-24 12:49:22
Did you restarting the app after that? Did you check if the port is actually open via a website? How many connections do you have active?
