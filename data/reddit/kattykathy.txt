“Net Neutrality issues can be solved through the community and private industry by self-regulation. It does not need the government to make this happen (i.e. “co-regulation”).
I completely agree. Keep the government out of the internet.

Good to see Bitcoing gaining in popularity.

About time this happens. The banks need to get on the ball with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-11-15 23:37:17
It would seem the banks see Bitcoin as a threat. If they are so powerful then Bitcoin shouldn't be in their sphere. Makes you think how powerful the cryptocurrency may really be.

Good question...

I'm sure this will cause an uproar with governments all over the world. We all know how they like to stay in control and Blockchain takes the control out of their hands and into the people's.

Hmm not sure about this idea. How does he download information and then retrieve it? It's not like he can stick his hand in a USB drive.

Promising article, but disappointing comments on here. I guess it will take a few years to iron out all the kinks and getting it running smoothly. Like any new idea you have to have a bit of a rocky start before it really takes off.

I think if any city has a chance Amsterdam has the best one.

I guess that's a new way of making it rain money!

It's good to see more places accepting Bitcoin.

Seems to me Bitcoin is making someone nervous. They need to follow their own rules and be fair in their dealings with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-11-06 18:02:42
Should be interesting to see how this plays out. 
@_date: 2014-10-09 22:12:56
More places are accepting Bitcoin. The cryptocurrency is gaining more acceptance.

Actually sounds pretty cool if you're into that sort of thing. And no strippers aren't scum of the earth. You'd be surprised at the type of women that strip.

Interesting, so will you be able to use Coin Cola like Paypal?

Sadly this story is no big surprise. Businesses do this all of the time, they just got caught.

A Texas Republican wanting to protect our freedoms and actually pass a bill that will benefit the US? Wow....about time!
@_date: 2014-11-08 16:43:04
Wow that's a big step for Bitcoin!
@_date: 2014-10-15 00:34:29
Good to see more places getting on board.

Yellow journalism at its best.

I think this is a great idea and I hope it comes to North America soon. I will admit I have a bit of a 20th century mindset about physical currency, but it would seem digital currency and cryptocurrencies are the way of the future.
