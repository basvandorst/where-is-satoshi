Bitcoin ATM if there is one available in your area. I have had great luck with them and they have been my safest and most convenient option for purchasing large amounts without waiting weeks for online verification.

My verification took almost a full month despite their assurances that it would take no more than 96 hours.

I think it's equally dangerous to highlight anecdotes of misinformed or under informed people and point to some impending be disaster. Increased adoption is why we are sitting at 1400 and so many people have made generational wealth in months and years. All the hypocrites who get pissed when someone else gets curious or interested in crypto clearly never believed in it in the first place. You care more about monopolizing knowledge and feeling special than you do about making crypto work for everyone. Yes there will be bubbles and peaks and valleys but seriously get the fuck over yourself. Remember that curiosity and fascination and passion you felt when you stumbled through this door? More people are feeling those same things everyday. Help them. Guide them. Inform them. Don't shit on them because you feel superior for adopting slightly before them. It likely had more to do with random chance and personal circumstances than foresight and intelligence. In fact, someone probably helped steer you towards it and helped you learn so you weren't clueless. Crypto is about opening doors and holding them open for the next person. If you shut the door behind you, YOU are part of the problem.
