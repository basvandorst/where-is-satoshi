Maybe because whales dumped the shit out of their wallets?

1) actually most of the wallet are deterministic wallet with a seed, so they generate a new address for everything, so it's not so easy to track someone down, but still possible
All the other points follow this one

I'm assuming for the """superaverage"""" person it's better having a miner in their browser instead of annoying ads.
Since you are not one of those you should not concerned by browser miners either. Period.

Your BTCs do not fit in a single ledger? Lmao

Bitcoin is nowhere near to be popular at the moment

Do you really prefer intrusive ads over a miner that as soon as you close the page kills itself?
Edit: i'm obviously talking for the average internet user which doesnt know anything about ad blockers et cetera. More experienced users are not affected by ads and browser miners

What are actually active users? Who is in bitcoin in general or who simply bought some?
Assuming the word bitcoin in this spreadsheet refers to every cryptocurrency:
Given current total market cap of around €320 billions, having 2.9mln crypto users means that each of those invested in average more than €100k
Is this even close to reality?
