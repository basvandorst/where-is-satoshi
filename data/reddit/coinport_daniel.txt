We don't yet have good support for mobile. We just started to design our APPs.

We haven't started to use nicknames yet (we planned to make the site more social but didn't really take that direction). Therefore please refer to your account using your account number to claim credit.

If we enable fiat, we'll surely need proof of ID and addresses. This is required by HK and US gov. We have received mail notification regarding this from HK.

hi all, this is Daniel Wang, co-founder and CEO of Coinport Exchange. This reddit user 'Coinport' is actually not one of us, but he is very kind and was trying to help us out. He not only said something nice about our platform, but also gave us a lot of suggestions, I see him as a friend of mine (although we have not met yet) and I'm personally very grateful.
Many users care about security (and all of us should). As an exchange we care both transparency and security. While we keep our source code open, our data open, all cold/hot address open, and keep all cryptocurrency reserve 100%, we have also started a security bug bounty program on crowdcurity.com (the program is not open for everyone but for selected security experts). I will post all their findings once they are all fixed.
It is almost impossible to make an exchange bug free or absolutely secure, and I'll never claim our exchange is, but we'll try out very best to secure user assets. That said, I agree to a friend of mine who is also in this industry: never leave a big chunk of 'money' in an exchange except when you are about to sell them asap. (We even considered to send all coins earned from a trade back to user's pre-setup address so we never keep user's assets except those in pending orders, what do you think of that BTW?)
User 'Coinport' promised for you to give you 1mbtc for signing up on coinport exchange. I think this is affordable for us so I'll keep his promise - we set up a 500 1mbtc rewards, for people who signed up on coinport exchange and posted their ids here in this thread. The following IDs should have been paid, for those who have not, and all users who want to claim their 1mbtc award, please make sure to send an email to me: d (with your numeric id please).
Users who has been credited:
1000001020 1000001029 1000001030 1000001039 1000001042 1000001043 1000001048 1000001061 1000001076 1000001077 1000001085 1000001107 1000001156
'Coinport' the reddit user, thank you a lot for doing this :)
