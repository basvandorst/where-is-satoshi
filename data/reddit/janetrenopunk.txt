Running a full node is great if you are up for it. If I were to sell BTC I’d do so on Kraken.

If he just stayed in his lane on the issue of bitcoin I think I'd trust him **less**.  When folks curate an audience built around telling them the things they want to hear they're typically selling something.

What's the best current node setup?  I like the idea of having coin mixing options built in, but am not totally tied to it.  Would definitely love to run lightning, but want to interface with that through my phone so don't know if anything can do that.

I love BTC ,but man...why do we have to bash anything?  I'd love to have more stocks too.

holy cow! reddit tips are legit
@_date: 2019-12-26 00:06:43
That's terrible

I can send you 1 satoshi right now.  You will receive 1 satoshi and I will give up 1 satoshi.  The fee's on the lightning network are negligible. 
(real offer btw, go ahead and invoice me)

Alright now in 2020 try to ween yourself off Conbase :)

You should definitely store it on your personal hardware wallet, and I'd recommend Cold Card (but Trezor or Ledger are good too).  I don't do much trading and like purchasing on Cash App bc the fee's aren't too bad and you can transfer your bitcoin to your own device instantly

Agree to disagree, but if you like it and want to stick with it more power to you :)

Invoice expired, hit me with another :)

Hypothetically you are 90% invested in bitcoin relative to stocks.  Keep buying bitcoin or acquire some more stock? What do (hypothetically)? :)

You got time :)

Someone recommended I set up a MyNodeBTC, so I've done that and almost have everything paired on a dedicated hardware device. I've got BTC stored on separate hardware wallets (Trezor, Ledger, ColdCard). What would be the best recommended light wallet to connect to the node for PC, and which one for an iPhone?
@_date: 2019-12-25 19:55:43
Which light wallet can I connect to MyNodeBTC and still be able to do coinjoin?
@_date: 2019-12-28 17:48:58
My man!
Get your full node up and running yet?  Or just going with a standard hardware wallet?  [either is great]
@_date: 2019-12-24 05:25:06
What light wallets do you recommend to connect to the node from a desktop PC (and which one from iPhone)?
@_date: 2019-12-31 21:58:59
Cold card

I’d say play it safe and do a 90/10 split. Having 10% in stocks is a balanced approach. :)
