When I read the book, I found it hilarious Lewis portrayed these men as heroes
Yes, They were right about the coming  crisis, but their purchase of CDS on mortgage backed securities made the crisis worse. In essence, they bought insurance on securities they did not own 50 times over.  When those mortgage backed securities failed , these men profited tremendously at the expense of the banks they were trading with. 
One can argue they, and others who took similar positions,  had a large hand in the failure Lehman and the subsequent bailouts of banks
I personally think of them as sharp men who saw a storm coming, and profited from the crash. That is all, though. These men were self interested , and have become much richer from their investments.

The taxpayers had to bail out the banks
The deceased lending from the banks led to decreased economic output,  and step decline in home values 
The banks got fucked. But so did everyone else

It's up to their auditors (E&amp;Y), but I'm guessing they would take some kind of average price from several BTC exchanges

The regulators can't make the users whole again. 
A lot of the money is stolen. IF they distributed whatever Mt Gox had left, people would be refunded pennies on the dollar.
I don't see what else is possible. Maybe people could go after the personal accounts of the founders (pierce the corporate veil) but again, the money recovered from such action would be nowhere near enough to refund all users.
tl;dr. The money is gone, Mt Gox users are fucked
@_date: 2014-02-10 16:26:22
Man, this shit is CRAZY . Bitcoin has gone through so much in the past yr. 
I agree, gox is probably insolvent. BTC is stronger than gox,though. I just hope this incident doesn't spark the government into regulating BTC

What you are referring to happened at the mortgage originator level. These are your local mortgage reps,who couldn’t be farther from the banks . When people think of wall st, think of the mortgage originators as operating in siberia

They (JPMorganChase) just got assraped to the tune of $13B in fines from the US government last month and another $2B this month. They probably want nothing to do with anything remotely controversial, like you said
IMO you can't really blame them in their position
