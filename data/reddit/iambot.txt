Thanks, much appreciated

Looks great I use bitWallet for iOS, and the cold storage decrypt and sweep sounded great! I tried it though with my BIP38 encrypted cold storage card encrypted/created using bitAddress.org offline... It didn't work, said the word from a nonexistent mnemonic was not recognised. :( a shame really

I've had the app installed before and didn't find it useful until now that they claim to allow sending btc via safari using blockchain.infos pushtx api.
BUT: I DON'T SEE THIS FEATURE in the app... is this a con to get people to download the app?

Surely they should only take ones BIP38 private key, to not do so seems idiotic and bad business practice re bitcoin ecosystem.

Presumably as we transition into a type II civilisation we will increasingly not need to minimise unemployment.
Just a thought, half formed, most likely

I apologise, for my hasty comment.
Seems the update hadnt appiled (human error?) and after actually getting the newset update it IS there. thank you.
I do wish it would accept bip38 private key QR codes though.
@_date: 2014-06-23 16:50:21
Yeah I do understand on some level, but I reckon it should just a warning  / info message letting you knwo it cant do conversion. oh well.
@_date: 2014-03-08 09:41:58
That is good advice (and i know its true), but as the person that made  it, its sad/unfortunate... :(
@_date: 2014-07-06 13:42:18
Ah that most certainly was the problem then. Thanks!
@_date: 2014-07-06 13:29:09
Haha it would probably be quite interesting to act as a DAO/C but in reality be an elaborate blockchain competent mechanical turk ;p 
Coincidentally working on turkd.net   (Pre alpha) but no unfortunately I am not a real bot.

1000 bits for your efforts so far @_date: 2014-07-06 13:32:31
It may very well just be a circumstantial bug (I do hope I haven't lost my funds) created the card months ago, forever in btc terms. 
But I really like the feature and as soon as I've sorted out my circumstance I'll definitely be using your app for cold storage sweeping. Good work!

I made this for someone who requested it, and figure more people might find it useful.
Here is a direct link 
@_date: 2014-03-16 02:18:32
Would like please :)

XPOST from the live demo sub:
It should show a qr code, as fugly as they are. Makes achieving this with CSS alone a little more tricky.
A potential solution is to provide a converter from address/hash to qr code image data uri, which could be used in the CSS. Good work though.

I currently host the UK Community site  [bitcoinalliance.co.uk]( and a few other smaller bitcoin projects, better/subsidised hosting would be much appreciated.

Thank you

Apparently the above sensibilities are very British. I had assumed it to be universal (at least in part)
@_date: 2014-06-23 16:42:36
Noticed this when my wallet (bitWallet for iOS) no longer let me make payments because it was unable to get the current price from (Im assumed bitcoinaverage, so I checked) seems like a stupid reason to not allow payments.

+1 also you could also donate via your membership fee, thereby at least getting a vote as to its future
@_date: 2014-06-23 16:52:31
+1 for a tipping DAC here's 300 bits  pm on its way ;)
@_date: 2014-06-23 19:49:33
Ah fair enough. As far as I'm aware they don't take a cut from paying forward and no withdrawal fees till September. But I'm pretty sure I can't untip it to you, so if you don't claim it then I guess they get it all. Either way it was the thought that counted anyway
