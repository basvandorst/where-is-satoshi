You can always just use a remote filesystem... Same great service with a lower price. Of course if you can set up remote filesystems you wouldn't be paying DO to set up bitcoind for you... There are lots of options, quit trolling this one, it's just as good as any.

You can't just make a statement like that without some kind of evidence. It's annoying...

This is slander. A flaw in the bitcoin protocol did not allow any "automated withdrawals" since anything that does so is obviously not part of the core protocol. bitcoins can not send themselves to other addresses, a program built on top of the protocol made those decisions and it based those decisions on bad information. The bad information was the Malleable hashes that exchanges used to look up transactions within the block chain. In no way is the protocol itself vulnerable, the hashes were known to be malleable in 2011 giving ANY developer time to address the issue by using better data to confirm transactions. CNN is a horrible news outlet that completely misses the honor and integrity of reporting true objective news. I am sad for the industry as a whole.

No worse than any other piercing I've gotten. The recovery is easier in fact. There are some risks, like it moving around, but they're rare.
