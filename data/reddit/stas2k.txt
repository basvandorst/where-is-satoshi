np, by the way, stop by at r/NodeMCU and for other cool stuff you can do with these boards ;)

Got myself a similar thing [running]( on a Chinese ESP8266 board.
For $6 it runs Lua with an attached OLED display.

I bought [this board]( off AliExpress. Then I uploaded nodemcu off their [firmware builder]( and loaded [this sketch]( into it.
Seems they have a better version now. Do reply to this thread if you need more help

Cool! [Crypto tracker page]( on hackaday already has a precompiled image for you to use.

You don't need a micro-usb to serial adapter, it is already on the board. Just connect it to your PC and it will show up as a serial device.

Yes, it is attached to a USB-serial chip

Sold my pre-fork BCH yesterday as soon as the news hit. There is no way this this currency can be trusted.

Nope, I just randomly saw a post about BCH and remembered I had those because of the fork. :) Dumped them on Coinbase, now got some cash to spend

My Jalapeno was delivered with the fan disconnected inside. I was just able to physically open it up an connect the damn thing. It ran 90 degrees celsius for about two months! :D
