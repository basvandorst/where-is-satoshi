I'm sure that happens everyday, right? Oh wise one. Please tell us more about the Bitcoin...
@_date: 2019-03-17 14:32:39
Agreed with other redditors who are about to pile in and kick your head off. The average subscriber in is a fucking retard, but this is by far the most retarded shit i've seen in a long long long time.
Now go slap yourself, and switch to something productive. This is fucking stupid.
@_date: 2019-03-22 16:32:13
this sub is absolutely full to the brim of the biggest idiots on reddit.
@_date: 2019-03-29 12:05:53
No no.... don't burst their bubble. It means Bitcoin is spreading fast and we're all going to be rriiiich real soon and have big mansions and girls with really big knockers.
@_date: 2019-04-23 16:33:09
dude sorry i've got a rule not to argue with idiots
@_date: 2019-04-24 09:26:34
Look the majority of gold mining and the majority of all types of rare metal &amp; rare elements mining go towards the manufacture of computer hardware chips, boards etc.
What you're witnessing here is people who are willing to put all the facts to one side, to feed into their confirmation bias.
Are you grounded in reality? Or are you willing to put facts &amp; reality aside to confirm your bias?
@_date: 2019-04-23 06:53:51
Oh look, someone on r/bitcoin who can write.

Beautiful, but still risky. The hill billy could have pulled out a gun. Also they could have easily kicked the bike over before leaving, while he was checking the plate.
Funny as fuck though, and that hilly's look after getting headbutted. He knew there was no chance in hell he was going to win, so didn't even attempt to retaliate. Priceless.

Noo, it would never fuck with us senseless for another 6 months at the very least.

Idea: Promote bitcoin by giving people handjobs while never breaking eye contact. Have a tear roll out of one eye, and say "please buy bitcoin. please buy bitcoin. I'll suck your dick if you do sir. please buy bitcoin."
Am i sounding desperate enough?
@_date: 2019-04-11 17:07:20
Yeah you must admit the links that people make to bitcoin on this sub are pretty fantastic though.
\- today i banged my foot on the corner of my bed
\- oh wow, that's bullish for bitcoin!
\- uuuhhhh what?
\- the pain you felt in your toe raises your pain threshold, and since we're all interconnected in a really weird way, you've increased the pain threshold of every human being, meaning humanity will be better able to HODL through those painful bitcoin downturns. Also you'll need to buy some paracetamol for pain relief and some weird-ass paracetamol manufacturer company in the middle of fuck-knows where just started accepting bitcoin. That's bullish. You feel me fam!
\- uhhh ok i'll go stand over there. bye.

You do know gold is used in the manufacture of computer hardware.. right? On what fucking planet do people on this sub live on.
@_date: 2019-04-22 22:39:26
Yeap, and some of it goes straight into the computer hardware used to mine Bitcoin. \*sigh\*.

I want to say something but i don't want to jinx it.
@_date: 2019-04-23 06:27:42
No i don't, but here it says 34% for the US: 
The broader point is that this idiot sub is trying to make it sound like Bitcoin is somehow less taxing on natural resources than gold. Same old hopium and confirmation bias. It's getting boring.
Now why don't you go and play in traffic, child.

The man wants to sell "buy bitcoin" stamps. Let him be.. 
@_date: 2019-04-07 07:18:40
u/timetravelinteleport agreed 100%, but it doesn't help calling him a "fool". It's important to stay on topic when criticising someone, else your criticism is too easily negated: there are many examples of Tom Lee not being a fool, which will end up sullying your point.
Tom Lee's price predictions were flat out \*\*wrong\*\*, he is misleading investors, and for this reason he should be ignored and shunned. I mean how often can a man be so wrong before people stop listening to him. Crazy.

Yes it is still mined with CPUs. I do some CPU mining for giggles, and i run a full node, too. You still think you're smarter than everyone?
Also, i'm no expert but essentially GPUs are a specialised kind of CPU. It has a lot more cores, to enable a greater degree of parallelism. But they're essentially the same.
@_date: 2019-05-01 13:37:20
Now title of this post is misleading. It's 7 degrees to Bitcoin. Everything links to bitcoin. The fact the company processing refunds can do so in bitcoin doesn't warrant such a strong correlation in the title.
@_date: 2019-05-01 23:53:54
How much of an idiot are you?
@_date: 2019-05-02 00:51:48


An ad that's airing in the states at the moment.


Yes that's a great point. And the Bitcoin community should understand what it means when the price of an asset is inflated by speculation rather than fundamental value. ;)
But you're right, and let's hope that if gold gets used less as a speculation vehicle (it won't) then its price might drop (it won't) and gold can start getting used more in other use cases than pure speculation (it won't).
Would be cool though.
@_date: 2019-05-02 01:19:00
Misleading title! Revenue is totally irrelevant here considering their costs were $64.7 million. Their profit was under a million.
Jesus H Chris policing the stupidity in this sub is a full time job.
@_date: 2019-05-01 15:30:15
Uh.. gold has no utility?
@_date: 2019-05-02 00:40:03
Yeah as i said: semantics. You're that guy.
Oh yeah antminers are exempt from the rule. Chips have always had, and still have their connectors made out of gold, and 34% of gold is still used in the manufacture or electronics.. but antminers are the exception.. sure you fucking genius.
And yes some people still mine with no specialised hardware, and run full nodes that are powered by absolutely no specialised hardware.
@_date: 2019-05-02 00:59:13


Gold absolutely has intrinsic value: it is the most non-reactive metal on earth. That means it's incredibly stable in manufacturing processes, electronics, medicine (implants of all types that enter the human body) etc. etc.
And it seems incredibly hypocritical for a community that is interested in 0s and 1s, which have literally no intrinsic value, to say Gold has on intrinsic value. Oh sweet irony.
@_date: 2019-05-02 00:45:09
Yes, but you know what attracts people? Intelligence, and saying things that are, you know, true.
How can bitcoin marketing end up putting such a huge shoe in mouth, when it could be just as effective without saying something so incredibly wrong. It's a shame. The marketing's aim is to get people with money to put their money into the system because they believe in it, and trust it.
How can that trust be made by saying falsehoods such as gold having no utility?
@_date: 2019-05-02 00:09:58
Yeah and on a lighter note you can now get taxed on your tax refund money.
@_date: 2019-05-02 00:21:18
Wow you're missing the point aren't you? The point is that gold is used in the manufacture of electronics you fucktard. And yes i meant because it's fucktards like you that give the community a bad name. The loud mouth idiotic types like you.

If i came home and said "honey i made £26,000 today" my wife would get pretty excited. Then i'd tell her that after my costs i made, well you know, what i normally make in a day, she'd have good reasons to be worried about me being a jerk trying to get her excited for no god damn reason.
No different.
@_date: 2019-05-02 00:52:26
Shut the fuck up.
@_date: 2019-05-02 00:29:03
Nope you are using semantics to try and disprove my point. You are strawmanning me.
CPU can be used to just mean processor, or microchip, or whatever you want to call a unit that processes, which is exactly what a GPU is, or what an FPGA, or whatever specialised kind of hardware that processes is.
Now a bitmain aintminer or whatever you want to call them, well that's really specialised boards, with specialised chips with high hash rates, and lower power consumption, but guess what they still have? Chips! And boards, and all types of wiring, that still have some parts made out of gold.
Now stop it with the semantics, you're coming off like the arrogant pedant twat you deeply and truly are.

Bitfinex prices are at a Premium.. of course you'd pick Bitfinex.
@_date: 2019-05-02 01:57:24
The costs ARE the bitcoin they sold. It's exactly the figure you're after. Not their revenue. Their revenue means diddly squat to you.
@_date: 2019-05-02 02:26:17
Well yeah people bought $64 million worth of bitcoin from them. That's the value you're after, not the $65 million. That could include fairies, and pixy dust and unicorns for all you know. They could have a revenue of $65 and sold 0 bitcoin. A business can have a revenue of 65 million and go bankrupt. Revenue is meaningless. You have to break up the value into production / acquisition costs, look at the profit, their operating margins etc. to actually glean information.
Revenue is meaningless.
@_date: 2019-05-02 01:44:51
Seen from that angle, you're absolutely correct. Maybe the title should be re-worded to focus on the sold amount.
I just find that when such a huge proportion of your revenue is absorbed by your production / acquisition cost, you may as well focus on the latter since it represents the bulk of what is being spoken about.
@_date: 2019-05-02 00:15:31
Oh when r/bitcoin doesn't know what to say, it goes lol. you got nothing.
