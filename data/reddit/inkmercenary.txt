I dream of shipping where the costs of shipping can be drastically lowered because of this. I almost want to start a delivery service where I charge less than traditional shipping prices without having government artificially raising the cost.

I'm happy for decentralized markets such as openbazaar that are accepting bitcoin.

Cool! Where are some sites that I can point to to get wallets? 
@_date: 2014-11-20 21:23:58
I purchase small amounts (. 25 btc) every 2 weeks. Point is that I can afford to lose said amount every time. Then again I am purchasing for the long haul.

It costs money to hold money. A sustainable mobile atm requires resources. I would love to see which pricing models would best serve the needs of the customer and provider.

I think he means whether that neighborhood is safe and if it has Internet service. Last thing anyone wants is to have thieves hunting down these vehicles.

I want to make a confession, I'm kinda happy the price for bitcoin has been gong down. I still think that as it goes cheaper, more people would buy it. Bitcoin had a great year Microsoft, Newegg, and overstock accepted bitcoin.

Is it domino's?

I simply can't wait! I want to add a list of trusted currency exchangers on my store if some could only paypal, bitcoin, or other currencies to make shopping more accessible on my store! Keep up the great work guys! 
@_date: 2015-05-18 14:18:27
Or maybe take an uber approach and have the customers handle the cost? 
@_date: 2016-01-04 14:25:55
How good is bitify? 
@_date: 2015-08-12 20:04:37
Openbazaar is my next hope. 
@_date: 2015-08-07 20:25:09
Would I get s better deal from them or gyft? 
@_date: 2018-02-09 05:30:57
Can you imagine one day someone will say "I wish I could own 0.1 Bitcoin"? You'd be an inspiration to many and a source of envy to some! I wish you well in your crypto travels!

I'm not upvoting this for attention, I'm doing it for my financial safety. 
@_date: 2015-10-09 17:38:00
Out of curiosity are you running Bitcoin core off your new hard drive?
