You cannot get "your investment" out and "leave only the capital gains" until they become taxable at the long-term rate. When you sell some coins after holding them for less than a year, you have capital gains on which you will have to pay taxes at the short-term capital gains rate (that is, at the same rate as ordinary income).
As an example, if you bought 100 coins at $70 for a net investment of $7000, and sell 70 of them at $100 after five months to get your "initial investment back", you will have short-term capital gains of $30 per coin on the 70 coins that you sold and so you have to pay tax on that $30x70=$2100. The other $4900 = $7000-$2100 is "tax-free" since it is just your purchase price of the 70 coins being returned to you. So after paying the tax on your short-term capital gains, you really don't have your "initial investment back"; you have something less. The capital gains on the 30 coins that you continue to hold will become (long-term capital gains) income to you only when you sell the coins after having held them for a full year or more: the gains on the coins sold after five months are taxable income in the year of sale.
Just to note I'm a CPA.

You would pay capital gains based on the amount of bitcoin you pull out. Divide your total BTC amount by the total amount you paid for it. Thats your cost basis. So if you bought 5 BTC for 10k total, your cost basis is 2k per bitcoin. So if you sold one bitcoin right now for 17k, you would pay capital gains on (17k - 2k) = 15k.

Literally down the same amount this year. Bought in around Sep 2017, officially in the red as of today.
