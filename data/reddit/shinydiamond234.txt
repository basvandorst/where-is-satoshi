I already did that before posting this. He's going to look at the regulations and tell me what it says about this. In all honesty, I'm not too worried and I won't care if it says I can't do this. Let's be real, this is Cryptocurrencies we're talking about here. You're all right, we have no rules or rulers here, and we like it that way.
He's a big procrastinator though, so I have to keep pestering him. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

In the early 2000s, my dad worked at a place that taught people how to use computers, as a counselor who tried to keep all the workers there employed there. He absolutely ***hated*** it there, so he quit his job after a few years of doing it. When he was there, he had to learn everything about computers, even coding and stuff (we still have all his "Visual Basic 6 For Dummies" and "JavaScript For Dummies" books laying around) and ever since I was 3, I've been extremely into tech. I guess I got his genes.
When I'm older, I'm planning on going to college to be a software engineer, hardware engineer, UX designer, or something else so that I can get a high paying job doing something I love.
And hopefully Apple doesn't make you their slave when you sign their contracts.

You're right.

I agree.
Try to name 5 kids you know that want to trade stocks. I'm 80% sure you can't.
