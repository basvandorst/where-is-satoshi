Unless one doesn't collect movies/series to never watch more than once or so, then offsite @ $5/500GB per mo ain't nothin too have a completely custom curated streaming service on-hand. Different strokes for those more efficient citizens. ��

There's a slew more where that came from, and the more you learn and faster, the less risk you can achieve, neighbor. :)

Wait. The Notebook is based on a superhero comic?

You're well within your rights to ignore any smartass retorts by those of "redditor for 1 week" status, citizen. Carry on.

You don't actually understand the topic, do you. ��

Holdup. Could someone please explain the form v. function on this? I mean, it looks pretty, sure, but why is pretty important for something that only you (if you're not an idiot) will see AND it's only barely liminal in its actionable relevance (ie. means squat without the holograms, and those aren't even demo'ed here). Seriously, wtf?

Not cool, bub. Simple search, and you could've done the artist a solid. ��

Sent one to the wife, my mom, and my youngest brother (middle brother already knows what's up). Keep up the great work, citizens!

I'm curious about your thinking behind the decision to cue the vid &gt;2mins before he begins his segment... Immersion? :p

It's a good thing you had a keyboard to type that edifying reply. No way couple you've dictated that vocally with Ver so far down your throat.

Not only that, but as a p/t Roulette dealer, the odds are considerably better with crypto for the player.

Nice use of "grok". Have an upvote, citizen.

"...and you will be fined."
Yup. Pretty much.

Apologies. You can imagine the number of scammers/bots one has to deal with in this sub, etc. I appreciate your human attempt at levity. :) Cheer up, space monkey.

The apostrophe is not used to pluralize, citizen.

You had me almost nodding along, until you used "long term". :/

Don't purchase on Coinbase. Deposit TO Coinbase, then transfer to GDAX (free, instant) and purchase via Limit buy to avoid fees altogether. ��

I'm not sure which cancer charity would accept a testicle that qualified for the term "appendage", frankly.

Never fear, that ol' tale of the BTC pizza is a myth, I'm sure. No way that purchase'll keep you up at night wondering wtf you were thinking when its then worth a stupid amount of USD. Never gonna happen, nope. /s

Oh, I don't disagree a single Satoshi.
@_date: 2017-10-20 04:33:26
Exactly what I'd presumed, and still feel is correct, IMO. I mean, if the transposition is simple mistyping, then why reassign the phonic of the O in addition to switching the L &amp; D? Makes no sense. Just lazy.

Not exactly a citation, citizen.

FTR: the whole "Keep Portland Weird" originally was a statement by small business and local neighborhoods in protest of big box stores like Home Depot, Best Buy, etc. moving into the city limits and squeezing out the mom &amp; pop stores... Thanks to Portlandia, and their tap-on-the-glass tourism, that moment in cultural history has become trivia. 
Now, I presume you didn't intentionally mean to imply that BTC was supposed to be for the little guy and should eschew big business, but I appreciate the accidental sentiment all the same. ��

Also, completely a surprise for the cast except Wilder, so the looks of repressed terror are genuine as they all were wondering if he'd actually lost his damn mind... ��

As a matter of fact, you can make more gold, and from other metals, too. Go ahead and search that knowledge. What a great Saturday afternoon project! ��

Sweet summer child. :eyeroll: [It is possible]( just entirely /stupid/ expensive to do so.
