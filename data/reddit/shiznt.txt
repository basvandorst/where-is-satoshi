Well thanks for that clever and concise statement, but if you take a moment to reread my comment, you'll see I'm questioning/wondering how many ASIC units collectively exist at this moment in time (operating).

This really depends on whether or not you want to speculate long term, or potentially (!!) make some short term gains.  It's been a funny week for trading, and while my gut tells me we're headed down again shortly, I have to say I just don't know, and so will sit things out for a little while.  You could always do the same, and keep a close eye on all things bitcoin for a while.  Interesting how in the last few days alone there's been a huge spike in bitcoin related news.
Good 'Luck'!

I know this is generally how mainstream media works, casually throwing around loose (mis)information as fact, but since subscribing to this subreddit I've lost track of how much total garbage 'news' I've read.  This article is a joke to anyone with a single functioning brain cell, but I'm starting to wonder who these stories are really playing to.  Even if you're a complete dummy awaking from a 5 year coma and missed everything post '08, the level of 'traditional banking' (good) vs bitcoin (evil) slanted articles is in the stratosphere.  It really does feel lately that the 'wait and see where it goes' approach is shifting toward taking bitcoin (or at least the idea of what it represents) much more seriously.
And pleeeease, enough with the spam already!!  I'd love to be able to buy a bazillion bitcoins for 1/3 of the price, but it's old already.

I think maybe people haven't picked up on your idea as clearly as you're seeing it yourself, but I do get what you're aiming at and think it's potentially a great idea.  Taking it step further the way to go would be to operate an exchange that not only functions as a legitimate currency exchange, but perhaps also includes a merchant facility.  The only setback with this is that unless you have created this unique facility yourself (never mind that this is what bitcoin is doing already), you would be faced with any and all additional transactional fees making the path between user and merchant (if you went through PayPal for example).  This is an interesting point though, because wishful thinking from bitcoin enthusiasts aside, bitcoin does have the potential to render many existing payment facilities obsolete, as long as we keep moving toward mainstream adoption and shortening the path/time frames between bitcoin purchase and spend.

I do see that happening as the middle classes expand, but for now proliferation is a bitch.  Education on what choices are really available is another thing, hence the belief that shelf brands like illy and Lavazza are premium.  What I do tend to see here is alternative cafes charging huge mark-up for 'Blue Mountain' beans and such like, running oftentimes $10+ a cup.  Again it would be great to find a way to provide a real alternative to the current fare, and at the same time know that the grower is receiving a fair shake for his/her product.

Detractions aside, it's a pretty looking unit.  I'm keen to know how long this thing was switched on and running to earn it's first $1.50 though.  It would be nice to see some hard data on just how profitable ASIC mining is set to be, or better yet see some staged calculations as and when ASIC units are shipped.  It can't be too difficult to confirm how many units are out there right now, and convert that into real world math.  I think most of us are pretty tired of all the guesswork attached to anything ASIC/mining related.

Volume still favours Gox, it's the market driver by a wide margin, hence the price difference.  Every now and then you'll see Bitstamp hit par (or above) when overall trading volumes are higher, but Gox will always move ahead based on an overall higher volume.

Seriously, who is running MtGox? I'm looking at their website for info and there's absolutely nothing there.

@_date: 2013-05-09 03:25:35
There's definitely stabilisation happening, but bitcoin is a low volume trade that remains vulnerable to the emotional investors it has, and their perpetual reaction to the slightest of news.  Until the commerce side of things firms up, and the process of buying is simplified, we're in very real danger of seeing a heavy drop in value.  That said, there are enough high volume investors who are looking to the future of bitcoin/crypto, and are less concerned with valuation per BTC today.  I can't think of a more interesting/exciting trade right now than BTC.

Lots of people here ready to stomp all over Greenspan, but if you take a look at much of what he has written about previously, it would be fair to assume he has good intentions.  And if those intentions benefit him personally at the same time, I don't see that there's anything wrong in that.  I suspect that he's looking to highlight the arbitrary laws surrounding money 'transfer', and that in turn has the potential to open up the possibilities for all future crypto currencies.  This is exactly the kind of attention bitcoin needs if it is to succeed.

For comedy I'm going with 'V'.


Agreed, and for the record I'm being tongue in cheek.  Aspirations and/or motivations of the Winkletwins aside (plenty of other threads discussing this), what else is happening for bitcoin outside of yet more speculative interest.  I can appreciate initiative any day of the week, but let's be honest this story doesn't add anything solid to bitcoin.  It wouldn't be too hard to argue that it does the opposite, so again what else is on the horizon that has legs?

Plain old common sense.  What do we have from the meet in Washington so far?  And even if regulation allows bitcoin to operate, what stops the banks and other established entities from interfering with, or vetoing related transactions?  How many incidents of this nature have already occurred?  How does bitcoin operate unabated in pure form without some manner of manipulation from outside interests?  All these questions and so many more are paramountly obvious, and yet are both constantly and conveniently ignored.  I definitely don't intend to come off as an antagonist for the sake of it, and I'm very definitely pro-bitcoin, but as an investor I have some serious questions about the expected longevity and validity of BTC as both currency and method of exchange.
@_date: 2013-04-28 01:28:14
I think it's only logical to assume that if any interested arm of government decides they want to cripple bitcoin, they could set about doing so in a snap.  In fact we may as well assume that it's already being hypothesised, with all manner of scenarios being considered.  As for ASIC's, if 'they' don't have them already they could have them set up within a week.  I think it's also logical they wouldn't be going to Butterfly Labs...  Or would they...?

It's great that this has worked out for you, and I do agree there's a huge element of the unknown with Bitcoin **in it's current state**, but that doesn't negate the fact that all things are possible, at least theoretically.  I would have been very tempted to cash out now if I was holding $150k in BTC, and even then at the very least would probably have looked to return at least 1/3 of that back into BTC as an investment.  All personal preference of course, we've all been making our own judgements, and NONE of us can honestly say we know where this is all going.
I'll ask this without bias, but given that you made out so well personally, did you not consider anything entrepreneurial related to Bitcoin?  And if not, will you remain 'out' financially from here on?

My first BTC tip!!  Thank you!  The article was actually a good read, though maybe it should be in another subreddit.  Not to be a preacher in any way, shape, or form, but there are certain individuals/authorities who love attaching negative media to BTC, and this is the kind of story that fits right into that purpose.  Never mind of course that illicit trades like this are weighted 99.999% of the time in anything you care to mention other than crypto, and that's still likely an understatement.
Again, thanks for the tip.  Awesome.

You're missing the point (utterly and fantastically).  'Analysis' has been pouring out of the woodwork over the last week, and this being the internet that 'analysis' has been all over the place, as has the price.  The price I might add of a commodity so volatile and so manipulated we could be here forever and a day trying to theorise and summarise where this thing is headed, but the truth is neither you nor I know, and that was my point.  Legitimate market analysis doesn't apply here.  I can imagine guys at 'big bank' looking at all the diatribe connected to bitcoin and rolling around laughing, and I say that even though I genuinely love the 'idea' of what bitcoin proposes.  This is another conversation though, main point here is that you're 'that guy' in this instance thought he'd hand me a slice of (mild) condescension, thus again throwing in with the notion that the wisdom of linear analysis applies.

Certainly starting to look that way.  Price has held close to $112 for a while, supported no doubt by the stream of positive news stories that have been appearing daily.  It's still vulnerable, and I'm not going to be surprised if there's another dip, though everything does suggest a normalisation.  Even the exchanges are starting to show consistent parity with one another.  Longer term however is anyone's guess.  The volatility and spike is what attracted much of the current attention, helping pump up the volume on trades, but as that too settles we are left with whether or not bitcoin as a currency (and all associated tech.) is going to work in the real world alongside flat.  This is still very much an experiment without guarantee.

I'm no technician, but there appears to have been very steady pressure to keep the price below $90.00 this week.  This has me believing we can expect to see a heavy rebuy coming from those who already dumped from $97.00 +/- coming out of the weekend.  Sure there is some price normalisation happening, but I don't believe speculation has gone away.  Plenty of people out there want to see the price come back up into the high 90's, and with enough momentum break North of $100.
Definitely hanging around the 90 mark right now though!

BFL are (as of today) advising 3-4 months 'likely' waiting time for delivery on new orders.  Mining might seem like a good idea on paper, but if you're not up and running now, you'll be lucky to break even anytime soon (once you finally have your rig), let alone make a profit on your outlay.

Anyone with a brain cell watching this weeks trades would have seen that the price has very actively been pushed downward.  The gamble was (for most of us) not knowing when MtGox would be back 'online'.  I'm sure some people have been wondering up until now whether or not they would be able to resume fully, and those are the same people who've likely sold on the way down.
Please dazzle me with your theory on why the price has come down in such a linear manner.

I'd have to go with **A-**, not enough circle jerk in that analysis.
