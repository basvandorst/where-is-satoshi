I think Roger has influence in the btc/bch realm, and that's enough for me to responsible to investigate him. I don't want to support someone I can trust. Similarly, I don't want to succumb to his influence if he is a bad actor. I'm just trying to figure out if I should be wary of Roger and his products. I want to know if I even need to avoid his website. It doesn't seem like I should be skeptical if Roger isn't who he is made out to be. On the other hand, if he is a villain, then I will be switching wallets!
Thanks for the response!

In 2002 he was sentenced to 10 months jail time. After the 9/11 attacks, I'm pretty sure his sentencing would have been much worse if it was as bad as you're making it sound. People get sentenced to far more time for possessing marijuana.

I think most people who invest in bitcoin don't understand it. I also think most people who use have never contributed to code, BIPs, etc. Does that also make those people shady?
I'm trying really hard to substantiate the claims against Roger, and it seems like you know a lot about what he has and hasn't contributed to bitcoin. Can you point me to anything that confirms the things he is doing are malicious or dangerous? Even anything on his character?

I did check it out. They were firecrackers, not bombs

the wikipedia page hasn't yielded anything useful, but I'll give it another look. 
I might be missing something... I don't necessarily agree with those tweets, but they deal with bitcoin ontology. Can you help me understand why those undermine Roger's integrity?

I really need something more than unjustified claims. Got any good articles on the subject?

Awesome! I'm getting to work on this now!
