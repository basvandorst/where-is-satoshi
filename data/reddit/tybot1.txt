I would check out [this guys channel]( His videos are kinda long but give all the info you need. I wouldn’t do a paper wallet if you want to check the balance and move the money around all the time though, like you are asking.

By hefty fee do you mean the $3ish transaction fee?

From exchange to wallet: 
Download a wallet (bread wallet, jaxx, etc), set up your account, secure your account with a PIN number and write down your private key that is generated to you (twelve words that only you know). Then you can copy YOUR bitcoin address from your wallet. Go to your exchange, and go to your accounts (where you can see how much you have bought). In the top corner (at least for coinbase) you should see a little send icon. It’ll ask you how much to send and to which address (you would paste your address there and put the amount in. Be careful cause transfer fees are kind of high right now).
Sending from wallet to exchange is the same but backwards. You’ll get the hang of it after your first transfer

Oh shit I didn’t know that, and I just bought $100 worth from there. Ah well. So from here, theoretically I could just sell at any time? What do people mean when they’re talking about keys, wallets, and chains?

Thanks for answering all of our noob questions. If I decide to transfer my funds from coinbase to Bread Wallet, is there a fee? And if I decide to buy a hard wallet (say, Ledger Nano), is there a fee transferring from Bread Wallet to my hard wallet?
Thanks for helping!

You probably did it just fine. Transferring takes a while at the moment
