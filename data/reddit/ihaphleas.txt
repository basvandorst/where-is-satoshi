He totally misses the point that Bitcoin, or most other cryptos, completely does away with the Fed. Even those that have tail emissions --- even if they had a percentage increase in supply every year --- still would have **known** emission/inflation schedules ... and, for most coins, no "central" bank.
Also, he doesn't seem to understand just how anonymous some of the other coins are --- namely Monero.

Because people didn't burn everything they could for fuel then.
Yes, Bitcoin uses electricity to secure the blockchain --- but the blockchain has to be secured by **something** that costs "money" -- whether that is by proof of "stake," which is just early adopters parking their capital rather than making investments, or by military/police force as by the state, or by mining/proof of work via bitcoin doesn't really matter --- they all represent "wasted" energy/power/money/time gone into securing the trust of the asset.

Yes, saving is good. See my reply above about Freicoin. For now bitcoin is working, and I think it always will. But I suspect it's use may change a bit when it's fully mined ... not that I'll be here then.

That's a valid point. My point is that there may be a place for other "abstract assets." In particular one that doesn't have "excessive" (whatever that is) deflation ... meaning essentially there is less need to lower wages every year. I'm away that rationally it makes little difference (in some ways anyway) whether wages are lowered or paid in a currency that depreciates -- but many wage earners will not see that. I think bitcoin is going to be great as a store of value and a method to make relatively large transfers -- but with regard to trade it may "suffer" from the idea that best investment of it is simply holding it. A good which slowly and linearly (or market driven somehow) increases in supply may be more "tradeable" -- and won't completely wipe out savings in it. Everyone would in some sense like to give a depreciating good for an appreciating one -- a good which grows linearly in supply may be more acceptable to both parties of a trade. Also note, prices falling for bitcoin assumes economic growth, when the economy grows it is often super-linearly, therefore this "currency" would have a mild deflation during times of economic growth. ... I'm not saying the idea is entirely perfect -- but neither can we pretend that bitcoin is perfect without more data.

Freicoin is built with a demurrage fee -- which in theory should have the same effect, but would probably be quite different in practice. I haven't read in detail, but the fee must be either a percentage -- which wouldn't be the same model, or a fixed amount -- which means small accounts are obliterated. No, what a man owns he should own ... but he can't stop the sun from shining on others, metaphorically speaking.

Welcome to the three handed economist. As the intrinsic value of bitcoin is zero -- the value will eventually fall to zero. Whether this happens in the next few years, decades, centuries, ... depends mostly on how widely adopted it becomes. As bitcoin is the first cryptocurrency it has the first mover advantage over others. Innovators, new businesses and emerging markets will (have been) the first to adopt -- but as adoption becomes easier (and it will) -- more and more people will. Bitcoin has many of the advantages of credit cards, online banking and Paypal -- with few of the drawbacks. As it becomes more widely adopted, more people will see it both as a store of value and a medium of exchange -- prompting wider adoption. There is really only one thing that I think could halt adoption -- making bitcoin illegal. (Nobody goes around saying we shouldn't use cash because drug dealers do.) I think the likelyhood of bitcoin becoming (remaining) niche is small -- either it will be outlawed or it will outlast fiat.
Assuming it is widely adopted, since bitcoin is a finite resource then it's value should essentially follow the economy -- while the economy is growing, the value of bitcoin is growing.
So, if we assume bitcoin will be widely adopted (likely), that the economy will remain the same or keep growing over several years (likely), and compare bitcoin to other essentially finite goods (especially their lows) -- then bitcoin is still grossly undervalued at the moment. ... However, too many long term investors and not enough users could stunt adoption.

Dogecoin is considered a joke, but it is scheduled to have a linear increase in supply -- I think this at least is a good idea. Many people here don't seem to realize that while prices will go down with deflation, wages will too -- I don't want to be the boss that gives year pay cuts. Assuming super-linear economic growth, a linear increase in money supply would still lead to mild deflation -- but perhaps allow wages to remain stable. I think bitcoin and/or litecoin will survive as savings/investments/stores of value -- but people will be less and less willing to trade it as the buying power, i.e. the economy, goes up -- thereby reducing trade and investment in business. So many people here are against the Federal Reserve controlling the printing of money that they don't even realize that mild inflation/deflation is not a problem -- the _control_ of it is. And right now it is in the control of a cartel.

Thanks. I'm well aware of the problems that can arise from badly designed generators -- and have some idea of how these things are done -- I'm a mathematician, though clearly not an expert on chaotic systems, information theory or cryptography. Trust me, I have no intention of designing such systems myself. My point is that  uses the mouse to generate some entropy and that this could be done on a phone by shaking. Also, I can't recall at the moment whether rand or urand is the more secure source of entropy on Linux, but frequently it needs the user to generate some more for the pool -- but perhaps that's just for large secure deletes.

Think of it this way, many people, if paid in bitcoin, are going to be taking pay _cuts_ every year ... as the price of goods, services and labor goes down. If I were a business owner I'd much rather pay in doge and keep wages the same. Notice that the supply of doge increases linearly while we hope the economy increases superlinearly, so we still have mild deflation.

Diverse portfolio ... say the mantra. A diverse portfolio is not efficient, it probably won't make a lot of money, but it's robust, which is what you're wanting.

It's quite true. Minarchism is not particularly consistent with democracy -- it should be consistent with a constitutional republic or even monarchy though.

Thank you for the answers. I suppose I need to read more about what a bitcoin actually _is_.

Abstract. We correct the double spend race analysis given in Nakamoto’s foundational
Bitcoin article and give a closed-form formula for the probability of success
of a double spend attack using the Regularized Incomplete Beta Function. We give
the first proof of the exponential decay on the number of confirmations and find
an asymptotic formula. Larger number of confirmations are necessary compared to those given by Nakamoto.
My notes: However, this only becomes significant when blocks take much longer to confirm than they should.

Really, when people invest in a company they are investing in society, in people. That company can hire more people or create more or better goods and services at a lower price. This kind of investment benefits the investor on all fronts -- he gets a financial return, new goods and services are created or old ones made cheaper and other people are gainfully employed (indirectly benefining the investor. Much the same case can be given for investment in a charity -- tax write off, employment, health (for example) of the community -- but all of these are essentially indirect benefits.

When you read the paper, what is the definition of what a "bitcoin" *is*? The only "thing" being transferred on the bitcoin network is a history of past transactions --- the history/record of addresses is what is being traded. For this reason, bitcoin must have an immutable and publically readable ledger. The blocks are the record of transactions, they must be in order both because one can't spend bitcoins which don't exist and because (again) that record is the only thing which has "value." Obviously, to remain both (essentially) immutable and publically readable, one must use a structure similar to the Merkle chain of the blockchain.

Generally I don't have to be robbed to pay for things I actually want.
Generally I am not born into a contract.
I would gladly renounce my citizenship, assuming there was the option of keeping the property that I supposedly own. There is, of course, the problem of the monopoly of various services that the government has taken control of. You may note that where it actually allows competition in the areas it controls (defense, court, transport, various utilities, the post), those competitors are often well used (private security, arbitrators, transport of different types, utilities not so much \[but people do buy water\], parcel services). Further, utilities are often "sold" on a cost basis (and some are even private or coops). That really only leaves transportation (roads), which, in the US (though I don't currently live there) are supported (mostly?) by fuel taxes --- which are much less egregious than taxes on income and property to pay for things I might not even use ... fuel use is, at least, correlated with road use.

No, all services are compatible with a profit motive --- or give an example. Further, those monopolies which *do* exist exist *because* of government intervention, not in spite of it. In fact, monopolies originally *were* "grants of monopoly" by the government to loyal subjects.

Healthcare, non-emergency healthcare anyway, is definitely not a counterexample. Even emergency healthcare isn't --- you seem to missing the fact that we live in an *iterated* prisoner's dilemma, with the ability to share information.
I may receive bad or expensive service at a hospital because I didn't have time to choose a good one. But you can be damn sure that I'll never go back (if I have any choice), and I'll sure as hell complain to friends and family. The hospital will lose business (especially for non-emergency care) thereby --- not in the first iteration, but in later ones.
The oil "barons" (or "robber barons" in general) were not monopolists ... many of them were simply ahead of their time in mechanization and therefore much more efficient than competitors. And so what if they drove competitors out with low prices (they didn't do so with force) --- did the consumers not benefit from said low prices? Do you think they could then just raise prices at will afterward? They could raise them a bit, but never past the point that someone else could make a profit by opening a business and selling at the same price. That is, they were selling at a price *below* the previous market price ... even if they sold at an even lower price for a while to drive other businesses out.
What if they bought up the start-up competitor? They sometimes did. And then when prices rose again, another competitor (or the same one) popped up again ... a constant (and expensive) game of whack a mole. So, they were forced to keep prices below the point that a start-up (using the older technology) might be profitable. And so, the consumers benefited from somewhat lower prices.
Should the prices have been even lower? Do the consumers have some sort of "right" to the lowest possible price? Why? These men invented new forms of production, why should they not reap the reward? The consumers were previously paying *more* ... if these men also made more, who lost? Clearly the consumers thought it was a good deal.
Note: some "robber barons" probably did benefit from government subsidy. Particularly in the train business, where the government used eminent domain to force the sale of land at "market" prices for the use of these private companies ... much as happens now with "shopping centers."
How is a monopoly of a local resource not the same as monopoly on "the market" ... that's laughable. Where is the difference? "The market" certainly wasn't entirely global in the 1800s. Suppose someone had a complete monopoly on helium, let's say, for the whole world, what then?

You'll see references to the benefits of gold as money, libertarianism and the role of the central banks in creating inflation and credit bubbles with fractional reserve banking --- these are all quite core the Austrian economics. Have fun...

Imagine a parking lot. It has limited space. One could charge a single price all the time for parking, or one could charge a bit more as the space fills up --- or various other schemes to maximize income. One's goal, clearly, is to maximize the income --- and this implies trying to fill the lot. However, it does not imply not charging at all --- not charging at all would simply be a waste of time and money ... hence they would better invest elsewhere (or find another use for the land).
Fees, for the moment *can* go to zero, since the miners have a reward for mining besides the fees. You may think that this reward is not currently sufficient --- but that would be a consequence of the particular facts of the situation (and the current value of Bitcoin), not a logical consequence.
Miners *could* make non-full blocks. But, yes, they'd be stupid to ... as long as there is some fee (which is enough to compensate their work). It doesn't follow that they would necessarily go out of business --- yes, it would be a competitive disadvantage, but they might have other advantages which allow them to remain competitive.
Some other cryptocurrencies are worth looking at ... yes, often to see what *not* to do due to the inherent centralization of some of them (PoS, for example). Others have *better* tech in some areas (Monero's better privacy, for example). Others have interesting ideas for scaling that aren't yet proven (DAG structures for example ... Bitcoin's second-layer scaling certainly isn't proven yet either). I'm of the opinion that Bitcoin will have difficulty scaling --- big blocks clearly increase centralization to some degree, small blocks directly prevent scaling. Further the block time of 10 mins is not usable for small transactions.
There *will* either be other coins and/or there *will* be a second layer on Bitcoin to scale in both volume and transaction speed --- but that second layer hasn't been proven yet.
Further, whatever "second layer" this is, it either must be centralized/trusted ... or it might work quite similarly to a stand-alone cryptocurrency (as we stated, some of which *are* centralized). However, what it *cannot* have is "small/full blocks" ... if it is to work at scale. So take your pick --- either you're okay with a centralized/trust model, or there is a way for big/non-full blocks to work if properly incentivized.
@_date: 2019-10-01 08:22:28
No, not all fees go to zero. Miners can simply not include transactions without fees.
There is the possibility of the unconfirmed transaction pool filling up if there are a lot of attempted transactions without a fee. But those without a fee can simply be purged after a day or so. No fee to miners, no reason to keep you in the pool.
Miners already decide the block size. Miners maximize their profit on investment by Bitcoin actually working --- you seem to think that they are incredibly short-sighted.
@_date: 2019-10-01 12:22:57
No, they won't go out of business ... see your second point.
Good, problem solved then.
Yes, they do. They can choose whether to mine BTC or BCH, for example --- they will choose whichever gives the best ROI. If the majority of miners decide to accept bigger blocks ... they're the ones who decide.
Yes, it does support the case.
...so you don't support hard-coded minimum fees or maximum blocksize?
@_date: 2019-10-01 08:17:07
Sorry, I've been away from the internet for a while.
I haven't read the entire paper, but the abstract suggests that it considers only the equivalence between fixed fees and fixed block size --- what if neither is fixed?
Sure, there are Prisoner's dilemma problems, but the market, and bitcoin mining, is an iterated Prisoner's dilemma. Miners maximize their profits by Bitcoin actually working --- and Bitcoin actually works when they all agree to do more or less the same thing. The iteration essentially forces them into the "non-stable" equilibrium of "super-rationality" (where one supposes first that other players will reach similar conclusions and then maximizes under that assumption).

I don't really care. The point of bitcoin was that it was built on lack of trust. Miners and users will go where they think they can get the best value. If bitcoin forks, so what? Miners and users will use the one they think gives the best value. If they don't transact a lot for a little while to figure out the market, so what? There are other coins too.

But it is possible to have a "tree" rather than a full tangle. Think of having a blockchain for fully confirmed transactions and only a tangle for the tip/top of the tree.

Was he controlling Mt. Gox? Classic seems to have had essentially the same stated goals as BCH, so all I see is someone who wants more transaction capability --- then again, I don't know the guy personally.
@_date: 2017-11-23 16:53:53
I'm not saying people shouldn't have an opinion, I want Bitcoin to be as usable and decentralized as possible too. The problem is that usable and decentralized are in conflict at the moment --- and that problem is engrained in the protocol. Bitcoin has to either change or have another layer built on top of it. Whichever way, Bitcoin, or the layer, will end up looking more like IOTA (I mean the "tangle," the pre-mined aspect of IOTA is shit). One way or the other, Bitcoin will get through this, or if it doesn't, some other crypto will --- and it won't really hurt mainstream adoption ... because cryptos aren't mainstream yet.

It won't scale in the current form, therefore it's not perfect.
I didn't say the fork was better, I don't know enough to have an opinion either way. One camp wants to scale off-chain, the other on-chain. There are pluses (and money to be made) on both sides --- there are big minuses too.
So you're complaining about them upping the blocksize and lowering the average block time --- about the only things one could easily do to increase throughput ... and then you're complaining that they have small blocks because so few people are using their chain. That just means "your" chain is winning.
People are allowed to have opinions, even strong ones, and claim that they are right --- let the market decide, we'll see.
Fine, exit bitcoin, it was just the first cryptocurrency, not the perfect one --- probably none of them are perfect. Until someone has a proof of a solution for the scaling issue, at least.

No, I just converted $1mil to gold using the current price of gold. Given current amounts of gold mined and the number of total bitcoins --- ~8 kgs of gold per bitcoin, gets you about $333,000 per bitcoin if they traded at the same value. Buy 6 bitcoins if you can.
@_date: 2017-11-23 15:54:37
As far as I can tell, BCH is not a scam, but a disagreement on how to scale. (Though both sides are slinging a lot of mud.) In my opinion, the bitcoin protocol wasn't written correctly in the beginning --- or we wouldn't be having this scaling issue. But that's okay, bitcoin will always be useful, and there are, and will be, other coins.
@_date: 2017-11-23 19:20:38
Ah, then yes, hashgraphs, by which I assume you mean directed acyclic graphs, (unless someone is using this term for a specific technology) are perfectly compatible with what you would consider a "light" wallet.
Or do you think that the entire record of bitcoin transactions is something other than a "hashgraph" --- made to fit into "hashchain" by virtue of the temporal nature of one of the dimensions of the "hashgraph?"
@_date: 2017-11-23 19:41:12
How is it not? Gold takes up more space? More people know that gold has value? To be fair, there are cryptographic ways to secure the key for bitcoin, but a simple paper wallet would have to be guarded in much the same way.
And my point was that having 25 kgs of gold is pretty useless ... which you've also demonstrated.

I'm not the author. I'm inclined to agree with you. Looking at the figures, the exponential decay distribution of wait-time for transaction verification looks good to me. Figure 7 says spam/very low value transactions have a hard time getting through. Figure 8 is strange to me though --- why aren't miners taking those 0.2BTC fees? I'm guessing those are low value/spam.

I'm not the same guy, but I don't see any reason that blocks need to be full for Bitcoin to work.
Certainly, there is an economic incentive by miners to maximize their rewards. This being the case, one expects supply and demand to balance. That is, if miners think they will profit more with bigger blocks (which will likely still fill up) they will support it, if they think the current blocksize maximizes their profits, they will stick with that.
So, it depends on what you mean by "work."

Interesting. I guess the totals are recalculated when bitcoin moves. It's not a bad system, but it's not how bitcoin was meant to be run. What this would give is simply control to those who can buy a lot of bitcoin --- a centralized system of banks. Granted, the current proof of work system gives power to those who can mine --- and one's ability to mine is closely related to one's wealth. But full nodes can also have some say in what they think is the "correct" form of bitcoin ... of course, more wealth means the ability to purchase more full nodes to influence that count.
Finally, the privacy of bitcoin is just not high enough for me to consider participating in that kind of voting.
@_date: 2016-07-27 16:12:45
There was a vote? If so, I'm in favor of blocks not being full. That said, fuck voting, the miners and full nodes are the only "votes" that really count.
