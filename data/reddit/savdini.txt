I survived the 08 financial crisis, this is nothing. Stay strong and pay attention

No.. Bitcoin fees are ridiculous. That's all it is, plus the network is overwhelmed. It functions best as a trade pair currently.

We're approaching the end of the slaughter, it's still on a monthly uptrend believe it or not.. 8500-9 range and should begin to reverse. This drop was good, it was necessary and healthy for BTC. I can't speak on the alts, many of them are being exposed for what they are, bullshit coins. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:25:43
BTC and ETH are the only ones that that matter. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 21:20:56
Lmao! 
@_date: 2019-07-22 20:20:09
I don't see a difference between cash app and coinbase. You can use either. Store long term on Ledger Nano S/X or a Trezor. 
Or use local bitcoins to buy.
@_date: 2018-08-13 00:06:53
There's a very real chance and others share this concern. You should start moving what you have off the exchanges and on to a hardware wallet.. 
Nobody knows when it will happen, but when it does it will be swift and devastating. They'll likely go after retirement accounts first, then savings, gold, property, etc. Crypto probably wouldn't be high on the list, but they might just bundle it all together in a swift asset seizure. It will be under the guise of national security, and they're not lying technically.

If you need inspiration for $7000 btc, you are viewing this all wrong. 
@_date: 2018-05-12 20:35:53
Nothing new.. 
@_date: 2018-08-05 00:58:54
You actually paid in btc? How did you handle the title transfer? 
@_date: 2018-08-13 00:23:20
I appreciate your optimism :) 
@_date: 2018-08-28 20:34:08
I completely agree with you. My own projections put the correction at about 5000±250. But I can see a dip lower if selling pressure increases due to panic. You can clearly see the down trend if you simply zoom out.
So many people live in the daily or hourly charts, they never get a full sense of what's to come. 
@_date: 2019-03-28 20:27:01
You are 100% incorrect on ALL of your comments, yet you try to put others down as if you actually know what you're talking about... Wow. You're just prick, plain and simple. Keep believing what you think, we're not here to educate you. What are you, about 12? You have a long way to go buddy.

That's it..? That's your response? Lol.. 
@_date: 2019-03-28 21:01:02
Thanks for proving my point.. A 12 year old on his iPhone that his mom bought for him is talking shit on the internet about subjects he knows nothing about. But by all means, continue. It's actually quite entertaining seeing you attempt to explain complex subjects incorrectly. 
@_date: 2018-10-15 02:09:30
There is no single reason. I would not expect any significant movement until 2020±1 yr. Just be happy it's stable and you can accumulate it.

That's what they were when I had my website, that was visa &amp; mastercards. Discover was slightly higher and Amex required a separate form to sign off on because theirs was like 3%+ something like that. That's why many will take cc but not Amex, theirs are high. Used PayPal as the payment gateway..
It's only restaurants that try to pull this crap. You can buy a pack of gum at convenience stores with your cc and they're fine. Restaurants can hide cash much better.
@_date: 2019-10-06 20:23:03
Damn. Wasn't aware. That's crazy
@_date: 2019-10-20 15:45:24
This is a true statement
@_date: 2019-10-06 20:15:32
Not that I'm aware of, but just wait. Every exchange will be seized once the shit hits the fan. Worldwide
@_date: 2019-10-03 21:00:07
You can transfer out after doing kyc now.

In the simplest of terms.. Banks make money by lending your deposits. In the case of an economic downturn, the loans can go bad and the bank no longer has your money. Which could cause a bank run, then the entire bank could collapse. That's when the fdic will find a stronger bank to buy that bank and ensure deposits are available. In the event of chain reaction of multiple banks collapsing, (like in 2008) the government will have to prop up these banks to ensure they avoid a total collapse costing many trillions of dollars eroding our currency value. Bitcoin eliminates this risk. Miners charge for their work to pay for electricity. It's that simple.
@_date: 2019-02-04 01:44:28
You think it's about the tech when it comes to bitcoin, that's why you believe it's speculative. Nearly every alt is better tech, yet here we are. You have a lot to learn. 
@_date: 2019-10-11 15:09:46
Bullshit. They're trying to avoid paying tax. The cc fees are like .20-.35% or 10¢.
@_date: 2019-10-11 20:09:19
Square must be adding to that.. PayPal wasn't that high. It was dirt cheap.
@_date: 2019-02-02 22:55:25
Well, that depends on your perspective. I don't view it as speculation. I view it as enviable. I don't have any intention on ever selling it. I'm waiting for the value to increase to levels where I can actually use it as intended. 
@_date: 2019-02-19 20:48:32
But not on Android.... Way to go Google

Idk, probably because people ask him and he needs to have an opinion.

Buffet isn't a good technology investor, he admits that. 
@_date: 2019-02-03 21:10:46
Again. Everyone is entitled to their opinion 
@_date: 2019-02-03 12:01:36
Speculation there's a degree of doubt. Like a gamble. I have zero doubt. Again, I think it's inevitable it's going to be used as intended or at least as a base to something else.

He received 500k from Koch Brothers after passing the tax bill. He's good now. He did his masters bidding.

We're all entitled to our opinions. Good luck 
@_date: 2019-02-03 20:25:45
I totally get it. I resisted for years. I first read about btc in 2010, it was 8 cents. I didn't understand it, I doubted it, I rejected it. I thought it was a scam.. I now regret it. I get it now. If you want to view it as speculation, or not investing or whatever, that's totally your call. I don't blame you. But once it "clicks", you'll get it. Or it may never click. That's fine too. Best of luck

I speculate buying Groupon stock hoping for a turnaround or buy out. I'd buy bitcoin knowing nothing will stop it. Big difference, no? 
@_date: 2018-11-25 21:09:58
I personally am waiting for six figure+ valuations, not to cash into dollars, but to use it as it's intended purpose. It will take its value in the high 6 or even 7 figures to be a viable means of exchange. We need the Satoshi to have relevant value. The whales need to start spending more as well, not just trading it. 
I will just accumulate regardless of price longterm. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 21:29:19
I wouldn't be winning anything, I would be buying it a little at a time over a long period of time. It's deflationary, it has to increase in value over time.
I could trade it and exploit others irrational moves, but I don't have the time to watch charts all day. I could swing trade I suppose too. Meh

Survived the financial crisis in 2008 and crypto crisis of 2018. Nothing can shake me. I'm always braced

You can't buy stocks with a credit card.. Why would you be able to buy crypto? Plus, I don't want credit fueling any crypto growth. I'm happy they banned credit cards. 
@_date: 2018-02-21 15:10:47
Yeah, but they're fun to talk about. I'm pretty sure most go with Satoshi as the creator. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 21:04:09

I'm not betting the farm.. I still put money in the market and savings.

We are a long way from the general public understanding nearly anything. Maybe we should start with understanding simple economics, then introduce the implications of bitcoin at a much later date. 
@_date: 2018-03-26 20:24:31
Yes, for a while now. Overstock too

Definitely the best one 
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:34:08
Exactly, use debit cards if you want speed. I see the argument of the responsible credit card user, but that's not the case most often. It's speculation by younger investors who run up their cc, lose value, and say fuck it and not pay it. Their max limit might only be a couple thousand, but multiple that time thousands of people. It's dangerous for us, dangerous for the cc issuers, and dangerous for themselves. 
@_date: 2018-02-17 16:24:55
