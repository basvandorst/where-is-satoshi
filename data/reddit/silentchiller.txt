20-30, last most of them on Mt Gox and sold the rest for cheap in 2014. I just started buying again early last year so I did pretty well overall although my Ethereum has really blown up my portfolio obviously I wish I’d held but we can only move forward in life!!

Congrats, I wish I’d had more balls in 2013-14
I had a decent stack back then and I lost some of it on Mt Gox, said fuck it and sold the rest cheap. I then stepped away from crypto until late 2016 and focused on stocks, property and 401K investments.
I got in on BTC and Ethereum at pretty good price points in 2016-17 and made amazing gains but I always wonder what if I’d kept accumulating BTC.

Sorry, I took your original comment in the wrong way and thought it was a sarcastic jab.
Running a Bitcoin Node increases the resiliency and decentralized nature of Bitcoin. Bitcoin stores all of its transactions on the Blockchain and this Blockchain is replicated among nodes. This is important because if a single party controlled all nodes it would be possible for them to alter the Blockchain or if they went out of business the Blockchain would go down with them. 
Miners have another function entirely however mining Bitcoin profitably without at least a $5K investment isn’t possible anymore. There are still lots of altcoins that can be mined, I don’t do a lot of mining but I have friends with 30 GPU’s that make about $2-3K a month from it.

@_date: 2017-12-27 04:06:29
Running a node hasn’t made me money.
I run a full node because I believe in the decentralized nature of Bitcoin and because I can.

@_date: 2017-12-28 13:29:19
I bought in early enough that these 40% corrections don’t phase me but I bought in late enough that I haven’t yet reached my moon. 
2018 will be a make or break year for BTC, BTC is still about 50% of my portfolio but I’m hodling several other coins as well, I may exit entirely from BTC in Q2 2018, I’m not sure how much longer these gains will continue.

It does, but hindsight is 20/20, probably smart to not drop $5K on every altcoin that comes out since 99% of them are shitcoins. 
I’m happy with the gains I did get though.

This is what I do, plus I have a few decoy wallets that have about $1000 each on my Trezors, therefore if I’m being held at gunpoint I can make them think it’s my main wallet and shoot them in the face when they get distracted.

Most of the people that I evangelize to don't realize that you can buy BTC in very small increments. I think a lot of newcomers believe that you have to buy whole coins which scares them away.

Compared to BTC it's laughable but my retirement funds have performed well this year. I'm still maxing them but I've been putting roughly the same amount into Bitcoin over the last 2 years as well.
It's definitely important to stay diverse, if Bitcoin dies the worst thing that'll happen to me is that I'll have to delay my retirement by a few years and I might have to get a used moon Lambo but I love my job so it doesn't really matter.

I might have to pick one up for my home lab, I do network admin/software development for a living so I have a fairly extensive home lab with a lot of Cisco devices.
My USG handles my 1Gbps connection pretty well, I get about 900/900 throughput.

I've just told everyone that I have evangelized to recently that Bitcoin Cash is a scam.

Also, setup a passphrase on your Trezor and memorize it, that way even if your seed words and PIN are compromised attackers still need to figure out your passphrase.

It could also be worth 10 times less, it's all speculative.
However using an investment to pay for an expense like this wasn't a good decision, please build an emergency fund for this stuff. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 15:17:30
That was me, I decided to buy more because I thought we were at the floor.
Every time I buy into something it crashes, still hodling though.

Still tons of gains to be had elsewhere, I made 200% on some penny stocks yesterday turning $1K into $3K in about 4 hours. 
I'm just hodling my BTC and XRP though.

True, I jumped to conclusions but I just hate it when people say that crypto is sexist.

Strong emphasis on **might**.
DCA (this method) is probably the safest way to buy in though.

In my experience, the magic of bitcoin has been its ability to produce a lot of "real" money for me!

AZFL and FUTL
AZFL is stumbling but FUTL is still running strong today. In still hodling all of my positions in both.
is actually a good place if you ignore the shitposting, as well! 
@_date: 2017-09-03 04:16:44
If BTC crashed that low I would buy a shit ton of them just to have them.

@_date: 2017-09-03 14:29:48
I don't think Bank crypto will fly though, it has no value as it wouldn't be openly traded and its not decentralized.
At this point I'm not really counting on XRP to blow up, but I've got enough skin in the game that if it does I'll be happy.

@_date: 2017-09-10 21:22:56
Before BTC, I did a lot of investing in penny stocks where 500% gains followed by a dive back to the original price were normal. Those experiences taught me to HODL and I made money on every penny stock I've sold. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 23:32:24
I'd be perfectly fine with a nice 5 to low 6 figure payout. I didn't act when I should've in 2011 but it would be nice to at least get something!

If a street thug knew they could get a lot of money by following you home, tying you up and ripping off your fingernails/teeth until you sent them your BTC, they probably would do it.

Get the game on, go trade
@_date: 2017-10-20 02:07:24
The price should drop to $13.37 just for me and then go up to $50K /s
@_date: 2017-09-10 20:37:53
In the future, I'd move smaller amounts of BTC in seperate transactions just to be safe in case your fat finger an address

Just buy more!

My "rich" (inheritance) friend told me I was wasting my money on BTC and some other investments a few years back. Now I have more money than him because he blew all of his on cars and girls although most of it is from non-BTC investments (property, stocks). If I could go back I would go all in on BTC. 
@_date: 2017-07-20 00:55:09
Looks like a bunch of gold diggers who want to get some of your BTC. 
Be careful. (srs)
