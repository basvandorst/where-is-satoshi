Have you read the whitepaper good sir? The real bitcoin is the one that stays closest to Satoshi's vision.

"We define an electronic coin as a chain of digital signatures" Page 2 of the whitepaper. Segwitcoin already botches that. And believe it or not, the whole point of Bitcoin is that it is TRUSTLESS. The more "layers" you add (I believe the plans are on layer number 3 already) the larger the surface area of attack and the more trust you have to put in to believe that every "layer" will function as intended. Not to mention the fact that the lightning network and its absurd concept of payment channels forces users to lock their funds away in limbo for extended periods of time, which contradicts the concept of peer to peer and borders on financial intermediation.
Why did you guys have to hijack the original vision of bitcoin?? If you don't like the whitepaper, if you don't like Satoshi's vision then MAKE YOUR OWN ALTCOIN. Don't distort something beautiful into into a profit driven monstrosity.

This sums up peoples paranoia well. Can't tell you how many fuckin retarded paper wallet tutorials I've seen. Trezor's and Ledger Nano's are the result of this, $200 drives designed to do what, super duper secure a list of 12 numbers?

My post has equal relevance to both BTC and BCH, so I don't see what the problem is.

What about the 1gb testnet blocks?? They were successfully propagated if I remember correctly.
FYI 1gb blocks are capable of handling 300% of the current global transaction rate.

Wrong, completely wrong.
Bitcoin is not a "useful asset" like real estate or gold because those assets have a fundamental value. You can live in a house. Gold looks shiny and can be used to make nice jewelry. Bitcoin is nothing. The only way bitcoin can get true value is through mass acceptance as a medium of exchange, and that isn't going to happen at this rate, with speculative Hodlers and outrageous fees.

What about the 1GB blocks they tested successfully???

This clarifies a lot of things for me, thank you so much! It's unbelievable that Satoshi designed and implemented features like this.

I don't understand, why isn't Satoshi's wallet shown here? Doesn't it alone have a million BTC in it?

Bitcoin cash?

JP Morgan was a BROKER, not a buyer. Big difference.

Transaction volume isn't growing though?
