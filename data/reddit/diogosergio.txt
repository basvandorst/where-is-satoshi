Yeah I wont be dealing with them anymore. I mean if they are really having troubles with changing to a new bank at least the minimum they should do is inform the user upfront about the processing time.

The thing is customer support sent me an email yesterday confirming they have received my money.. and now because their service is slow I'm the one penalised. They should've locked the rate once the money was in their account. 
So Basically they got the money and I had to wait for them to sort their issues.

The whole point in this article is for them to mention B1X instead of BTC and start creating the misconception of what is BTC and who will keep the name after the hardfork.
