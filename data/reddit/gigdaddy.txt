The fuck did you just say to me? ಠ_ಠ

Should probably keep that stuff in a bottle, given the volatility...

Seriously, though -- You know this guy (if it is *one* person) has to be absolutely terrified of being identified.  People would kill for a lot less cash.

I know a certain frog that is about to grace the cover of my Trezor...

Right, but suppose you never actually "cash out"?

What's the benefit to holding Bitcoin in an IRA as opposed to just buying Bitcoin outright?

That was fun -- Had some really interesting questions that made me have to stop and think.   Well done.

Would have really liked to have been a fly on the wall during those. Also a missed opportunity to upload some YouTube gold.

I think this sub earned the right to be a little excited about this.  Personally, I thought the whole thing was kind of fun :)

Not trying to troll or anything, but is there any legitimacy to this?  Seems a little like reading tea leaves or something...

What is this drivel? A well reasoned response to the current bitcoin volatility?!  P'shaw... /s
@_date: 2017-01-17 17:49:06
You know another way??
@_date: 2017-01-05 19:35:54
I think I may have pooped a little...

I don't think any world government is going to willingly hand over control of the money-market.  I honestly view Krugman's public statement as an attempt by the powers-that-be to discredit cryptocurrencies, in what minor way they can. 
This shit is the future, and I really don't see how there is anything they can do to stop it.
