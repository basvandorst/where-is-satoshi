I've been waiting for some decent coverage here. I haven't heard of anywhere except that restaurant in Roppongi that you can use Bitcoin at. Hopefully this will spread adoption. I'm going to have to grab myself a copy of this. Now back to sleep.

Honestly, I wouldn't expect one any time soon... They've not even released an update to support the iPhone 5's screen, and the simplicity of the app means it would(should) take them a matter of minutes to do so. I hope you figure it out!

Just confirming that the app is working correctly for me on 7.0.2 and I DO have 2FA enabled. Also, I installed the app fresh when I was still using 7.0.1, so just running an update on the OS didn't kill it in my case. For what it's worth, I did it OTA. I won't be updating to 7.0.3 now just in case, but would be happy to hear whether you get it working again on the new OS!
If you have a dev account you should still be able to downgrade to 7.0.2 using--assuming you own a mac--Xcode but your window to do this is slim; 7.0.3 is already out and it doesn't take them long to stop signing. If you don't you could ask someone to add your UDID to their devices list and then use their credentials to run the downgrade. It is against the EULA, though. I would do it for you if I still had an account... Sorry I can't be of any more use :(
On second thought, though, they *may* still be signing 7.0.2 through iTunes. If you grab the correct IPSW for your device and then hold alt when telling iTunes to recover you can choose which IPSW to use. Irecommend Googling "7.0.2 IPSW RedmondPie" to find the IPSW; the site contains instructions, too. This is all assuming they are still signing for 7.0.2, however. On top of that, unfortunately, it will also be a recover, so you'll need to reinstall your apps if you do this.
Please let me know if you get this working or not, though! It's possible they introduced/fixed a bug in 7.0.3 that's not playing happy with the app; when you submit an app you have to state whether or not it's using some kind of cryptography, so the blockchain app does lie in a special-case region.

As you've seen from the other comments it doesn't apply here, but you sound like a person who would like the Zeitgeist films.
