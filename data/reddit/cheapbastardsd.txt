Interesting, thanks!
Can anyone describe the process if redeeming/cashing out the debt tokens? I haven't heard of that before. What happens in the best case if I held 1 btc at btc-e under the debt token scenario?

Not yet, just tried.

Try using a VPN - I am in the US and could not connect until I set up a foreign VPN and then it worked fine. No trades allowed yet though.

FYI, for those in the US, you may need to use a foreign VPN to access the site.  I tried and got the 520 error that others are reporting. I set up a free VPN from asia and was able to log in to the site.  No trades are possible yet though.  I remain hopeful!

Yes, I should have said many good vpn providers offer a free trial, which will last long enough to connect and login to btce and move coins once they enable trades. As always, you get what you pay for.

Exactly, why would they - unless the remaining members are just hoping it will come back. No mention of any asset seizure related to the arrest, so who knows?

Newbie question: how do I calculate how many bytes any given transaction will be? Can't this ratio be expressed as N satoshi/btc transferred?

Got it, thanks!
