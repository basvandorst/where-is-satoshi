Thank you for your advice!

Alright, alright. You are all telling me to lawyer up. I'm (reluctantly) going to a lawyer this week, and not giving any more info to the police.
Edit: lawyered up. In hindsight, I was very stupid not to do it in the first place. Thank you so much, zoiks1, xrandr, and others for convincing me!

That was in September-October, so more like 20k, not 140k. But yeah, I guess it's really worth getting a lawyer. The thing is, I have no idea of the cost of a lawyer. I was going to wait and see if the police became really insistent, but there are so many comments in this thread telling me to lawyer up right now that I decided to do it this week.
@_date: 2013-12-25 11:49:25
Well actually I don't even know if I was "arrested" or "brought in for questioning", since I didn't resist.
I know I have rights to a lawyer, but I thought "I did nothing wrong, why would I waste money on a lawyer?"
Edit: lawyered up and that may have been the second best decision in my life. (Best one was to invest in bitcoin)

I just talked to a lawyer. I won't be in any kind of trouble. I will pay in lawyer fees more than my cumulated profits though. I take that as the cost of a great life lesson and a wake-up call.

I recovered my password, so thank you again. Those are my first doges.
@_date: 2013-12-25 10:24:10
Thanks for the info. I did 8k one day so... shit.
Edit: I'm in Australia but there may be a similar law.
@_date: 2013-12-25 10:10:51
Yes, I didn't want to be arrested by force. I don't have a lawyer, but if the police insists on me giving back the money, I'm getting one.
Edit: got one.

His username is hindicus, but it seems that he deleted his account.

I'm honored to have you in my thread.
@_date: 2013-12-25 12:08:06
Yes, now I see it. I'm always so trusting and naive. This is really a life-changing lesson for me. I even started locking my doors, which I never did before.
Of course the bad guy in this case is the bad guy, not the bank or the police or the bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-12-25 10:08:49
Well that's what I'm thinking. But I don't think that the good faith argument is legally receivable in general. Is it?
@_date: 2013-12-27 02:04:09
I just saw a lawyer. He told me I can disclose the info that the police already knows. So here we go. I'm in Brisbane, Australia. The criminal deposited stolen cash which was part of a bigger robbery into his account. The reason the police froze my account and not the criminal's account is that they wanted to know where the money was going.
@_date: 2013-12-25 11:20:37
That was my first thought. But should we let crooks access their stolen money?
Anyway, I invested a few percents of my assets in bitcoin and I'm staying for the long run.
@_date: 2013-12-25 12:10:42
Very sound advice. I will man up and lawyer up.
@_date: 2013-12-25 12:28:34
That would be the best! But unfortunately I live in a country where bitcoin is so unknown that even the members of the cyber-crime department didn't know a thing about bitcoin.
On the plus side, I think I convinced a few police officers to buy some bitcoins!
@_date: 2013-12-25 11:50:01
I'm giving up peer-to-peer trade altogether.
@_date: 2013-12-28 13:56:49
Yes sir. Sorry sir.
@_date: 2013-12-25 10:33:15
I don't know how they traced the money. I asked the same question than you to the police. If the money was dirty, why didn't they stop the senders account before he sent me the money? They told me they lost track of the money until it went back in large sum to my account (the last transaction was AUD 9k)
@_date: 2013-12-27 02:30:21
Thank you for your input. I'm in Australia.
I think the money has already been linked to the fruits of the crime. In fact, the money was already on the radar before I got it.
@_date: 2013-12-27 01:31:39
Thank you so much! I'm in Australia though. I just saw a lawyer and that was far from free...

@_date: 2013-12-27 01:33:55
OK, I was brought in for questioning, but not charged with anything then.
@_date: 2013-12-25 11:03:05
I think so too. I get the feeling that they don't really have a case against me, and that anyway they are putting all their effort into getting the guy who stole the money in the first place.
@_date: 2013-12-27 01:40:18
Well this is not a proof, but here is the last transaction I did:
@_date: 2013-12-25 10:05:24
Don't you think localbitcoins is the perfect place for money laundering? In hindsight, it was bound to happen to a heavy buyer/seller like me.
I had to use a throwaway account because the police forbid me to disclose my situation except to my family and my boss.
@_date: 2013-12-25 10:35:15
I think in the end I will have to lawyer up. I don't even know if I did wrong or not.
Edit: lawyered up
