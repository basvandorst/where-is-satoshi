Legitimate question. But  downvoted because "How the fuck can you be so fucking insensitive, you are supposed to just intuit that he has tourettes."
Hila is definitely stoned all day every day.

Well, i guess the reason jack couldn't get on the piece of wood was to preserve his perfect image. If he dies at the point where he has provided a great "service" to the young lady, and then promptly sacrifices his life for her, then his perfection is immortalised forever, never to be tarnished by the simple drudgery of life that was sure to follow jack and winslet in to the new world. Immigration, squalor (unless she phoned her rich family, which she ofcourse wouldnt because of other archetypal values which are present in  stories of this type).
Poor Jack, i hope the fuck was worth it.

Im pretty sure bank runs are a regular thing. Every 10 to 15 years.

If you can put it under your pillow, in your dream, whilst your sleeping, then surely when you awake it will be there. Works for me everytim.

If they didn't already know of "hodl" they would have been introduced to it at that point. There's a first time for everybody.

Thanks. I forgot about that.

Thanx for putting me right on that

Yeah. It sorta blind sides you when you least expect. I wake up in the morning thinking about crypto but i have planned my life around other mentally time consuming things. I jave time for it but not to dig around doing a search when i know people will sometimes help when asked and save time.

It's a secure building with a safe inside, but that's not important right now.

Apply a filter. Just type in:
If (meme) == retarded
        then eject (meme)
If you type that into the chrome browser...

Is it a bubble though? Whats the money being used for? Are people actually trading right now? Buying stuff? At some point its gonna have to be used for something. Right now it seems to me that everyone whos already invested is pushing the price up. We need a big drop stabalise the price so people will start spending. I wonder when that will happen. Tick. tick. tick.
