Here's some advice for you son.
Buy "BA".

This was written by a Ron Paul fanboy. That's one of their favorite words.

Well, yes. The article is dated yesterday!
@_date: 2013-03-07 13:24:52
Next thing I'll post will be the Bitcoin crash
@_date: 2013-03-24 22:34:25
Targeting bitcoins? Get a grip!
BTW, the Paul campaign was never headed in the right direction. He never had any intention of being President!
@_date: 2013-03-14 22:05:43
Bitcoins? LOL. I like this one son!

Wake up sheeple!
@_date: 2013-03-19 11:27:25
I guess bad news does get old.
@_date: 2013-03-24 22:35:14
The New World Order!
@_date: 2013-03-07 11:49:19
Sell what?
@_date: 2013-03-14 17:32:19
Better advice would be don't buy them in the first p[lace.
@_date: 2013-03-25 00:14:38
We really are a fun group. We're not into all this doom and gloom stuff. Life is too short for that crap. :)
@_date: 2013-03-07 13:22:56
It was not my opinion son, I didn't write the link I posted. Some Ron Paul supporter did!
@_date: 2013-03-07 17:45:13
Spiritofgreen-light is a stalker. He wasn't part of this conversation! He's been banned twice recently for giving people's personal information..

Why? Is this sub a Police State?
@_date: 2013-03-07 13:04:17
Sorry brah, I was never insane enough to buy bitcoins.
