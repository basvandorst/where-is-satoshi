You speak from your ass with such confidence. With such a boisterous ass, who needs facts?

It would hardly be Bitcoin related if it didn't have delays. Classic. ha
@_date: 2013-10-09 07:39:54
If you sent these marked satoshis to a wallet that already has BTC in it how would you tell the difference between the one's that were already there when you tried spending some?
@_date: 2013-10-09 09:10:33
Ok, so one more question.
Lets say me as an issuer of some kind of asset has so many colored coins that represent a stake in my asset, and someone then decides to unmark their coins as colored. Now i have less units than i originally intended, right?
If i issued 100 shares, and someone de-colored a coin, do i now only have 99 shares?

How does this have downvotes?

Bro, do you even mine?
@_date: 2013-10-31 08:28:34
Oh, i thought a direct link in a more visible area (like  would be more helpful. I guess if any new person wanted get the torrent they could just search the forum for that one thread. Makes sense seeing how everyone knows about "jgarzik".
@_date: 2013-07-26 18:16:04
Can you explain the difference between the encryption they have and end-to-end encryption? Thanks.
@_date: 2013-11-05 12:47:54
You actually don't need TOR to view the link - "onion.to" can be viewed through any web browser. The particular post it links to is just the first post of a *stickied* count down thread, it's just an official count down clock. 
@_date: 2013-08-12 10:11:25
Yeah, I love it as well, but that blue just seems flat. I'd love to see it in white, and maybe just slightly less opaque then the colors below. Maybe it would blend In smoothly while still popping out from the other visuals. 
Ps. Also not a designer. Just a Bitcoin enthusiest looking at some great visual work that I could really see going viral.

Here's an idea: how about a Bitcoin related project without the words "Bit" or "Coin" in the actual name.
@_date: 2013-10-21 14:15:29
The quick jump up doesn't feel "natural".
@_date: 2013-10-04 20:28:43
Do you see how much support Bitcoin has, how people lash back when they feel something they believe in is not being reflected in an accurate light?
That's where Bitcoin gets it's strength, and that's where it gets it's value - from the community.
@_date: 2013-10-09 08:30:03
Thank you.
So, there will in fact be less "normal" bitcoins on the bitcoin network

Does it? I was under the impression that Ripple was not decentralized. 
@_date: 2013-08-12 10:27:10
I feel the white lines where a great way to highlight/ bring attention to the peer to peer network - one of the foundations of bitcoin. I'd love to  see them more premeditated, for a lack of a better word. For example: you could have photos of people In the street going about their daily lives, but with invisible tethers (portrayed by the visual white line) conecting all of them. Just to continue that peer to peer decentralized message. 
@_date: 2013-10-28 20:43:35
Oh yes, yes. What he's saying is the people in the network ultimately decide what features in the protocol they accept, and will follow. If ~~Gaven~~ the Bitcoin Dev team ever makes such a radical change to the Bitcoin protocal that the people in the network feel it will be ultimately un-beneficial, they can choose to opt out of the update to their wallets - there by rejecting the new features, and forking the blockchain to favor the wishes of the network.
@_date: 2013-09-28 05:39:53
I've heard the name. Ant features you like that it has and others don't?
@_date: 2013-08-12 11:30:24
YOU are the bank now. I feel like this may take awhile to sink in for some people - I my self have had some close calls. The thing is when you give your self the power to be your bank like what bitcoin offerers, you also take the extra responsibility. Most of the time with mistakes like these (particularly with private key lose) there isn't some tech support that will come save the day. It's everyone's responsibility to take necessary precautions, and even some extra ones just to be safe. Once they're gone...they're gone. The very encryption that makes it such a powerful tool will stop you from performing any brute force attack.
@_date: 2013-09-27 13:17:52
No mining at all. They just started with ALL the xrp.
@_date: 2013-10-12 23:34:59
So, just like every other sport?
@_date: 2013-11-13 06:19:29
The problem is to get large amounts of Bitcoin you must identify yourself, and if the exchange is in compliance then it's taxable.
@_date: 2013-06-08 19:36:54
I’ve heard that such changes in the code are possible, but I guess I don’t understand where the line is drawn – how far the development team is allowed to tweak the fundamentals of the coin.

Yeah, i literally had to sit down and explain the whole ROI thing. I don't blame them though - people hear about it and get so excited to jump in an be a part of the action.

But if they are colored and the company goes belly up how can you make them regular bitcoins again?

If Picostocks let them list knowing it was a scam, and kept the BTC that would be hilarious. Can't say i'd feel bad about a scammer getting scammed.

It is true that whether Litecoin is or isn’t an actual improvement is highly debatable; I was simply using it to highlight the changes people have been making to attempt an improvement. I believe the ideal block speed has yet to be determined, but would be a characteristic of the ideal coin.
