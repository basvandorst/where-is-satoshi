Wish I could find my wallet.... hard drives long since smashed up and tipped, paper wallets shredded by the wife when we moved as she didn’t know what they were and I have absolutely no clue how it’s even possible to track any of it down now.

I was an early adopter. Signed up to 500 bucks worth when it first was floated and since then completely forgot about it, at the time I was looking to take a punt on something anyway since then I have lost any and all ways to access to what was there.
It wasn’t until all of the furore surrounding it that someone asked me if I had any and at the time I said no I don’t think so.. not really knowing what it was... then I looked into it and realised I actually had bought it.
Of course by then the hard drives and any paper wallets pertaining to it would have been long since shredded.
�� I guess I just have to put that down to experience.

Isn’t it obvious who Satoshi really is?

You might think that a reduced supply makes your coins more valuable however.....
The reduced numbers of coins available and the ease with which many early adopters lost access to their coins mean that bitcoin probably was little more than an experiment to test if a theory worked.
As such and since many issues have become apparent with the system it will likely be another form of crypto currency which gets adopted for world wide use In a decentralised system and becomes the go to.
Bitcoin is only valuable whilst there is a demand for it, at the moment it is pretty much just the hype that’s surrounded it which is supporting its values and sooner or later the bottom of that market could well drop and these coins will become worthless.
Something is only worth what someone is willing to pay. Bitcoin itself is not a product.
The experiment was never about bitcoin but blockchain, blockchain is the product and as such the valuable aspect of this.
Blockchain can survive and thrive without bitcoin, however bitcoin would be nothing without blockchain.
So whilst your laughing that this guy has lost his and made your holding potentially more valuable remember this.... if enough coins are lost people will just lose interest, the bottom will fall out the market and everyone will walk leaving bitcoin to die.
So enjoy ��

Mt gox was bad, but worse still I always suspected it was perpetrated by those on the inside of things.

Sorry, I don’t bother with trolls that accuse people they don’t know of ��

Ok so buy new and directly from the source. Would you guys pick Nano S over Trezor or pick up both or something else?
