Use gemini then. I'm not saying they are great, but their number 1 priority is security, which I think is the correct way to run a fiat exchange. 
I am not arguing coinbase is incompetent atm, because they are clearly way behind on everything. But I was here to argue that I truly don't believe they are committing theft.
@_date: 2018-01-06 04:09:45
How is not having the enough bitcoin in their hotwallets theft? If they don't have enough bitcoin to provide sellers, that is just a lack of liquidity.
@_date: 2018-01-06 05:07:53
No I honestly think they just have that much demand. It's very possible their cold storage is getting depleted with this massive influx of buyers. If people are sick of waiting for coinbase to restock on bitcoin then they should use GDAX to buy from other people. That's the proper way to buy anyways.
Coinbase is making a damn killing off transaction and most significantly the withdrawal fees that I would be shocked that they need to steal bitcoin to turn a profit.

So I did some digging and I found a transaction that gave block rewards to a miner. If anybody is curious, this is what the transaction would look like.
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:15:29
Dude, every exchange keeps your transaction history. Upload it to bitcoin.tax and there's your tax form. Go to H&amp;R block with that. Otherwise you are most likely going to get a "IDK how to do crypto" from them.
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:00:44
Thank you for that technical explanation, that is more of what I was looking for. So basically the block is allowed (doesn't necessarily have) to include a transaction that has no inputs, and one or more outputs. This is referred to as the block reward. Does the miner set the value of this transaction to be the current agreed-upon value (currently 12.5)?
So if a miner were to check their wallet in the block explorer, would it just show +12.5 btc to their address? (Assuming they mined the block by theirselves)?
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:08:45
So could a miner "forget" to award themselves with a block reward?
Obviously this isn't likely to happen nowadays, but maybe back in the early days of bitcoin where the reward wasn't as valuable. I'm just wondering if a miner could choose not to award themselves the full amount, and if so could that block reward be claimed on the next block or are those coins just never going to be part of the circulating supply?
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:52:39
Thanks for the reply. So that leads me to believe that the miners could potentially award themselves more bitcoins than the current agreed-upon amount (currently ~~25~~12.5). If I were to look at the block explorer of a miner's wallet, where would these 25 bitcoins be sent from?
Could a miner award themselves 26 bitcoins (or 0, or some other number)?
I guess as an average bitcoin user, there isn't much explanation on how bitcoins are generated into the supply and the whitepaper doesn't seem to actually discuss this process (unless I'm missing it). I apologize if this seems like something I should know, but i'm genuinely curious.
*edit (block rewards are currently 12.5 bitcoin not 25)
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:49:59
Thanks for highlighting where it is mentioned in the whitepaper. I did read that but I guess I didn't fully understand the technical details behind it. I guess I was just looking for a more detailed explanation of how the software works than the high-level concepts explained in the whitepaper.
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:03:47
That's interesting. So do you think that the entire block reward would be rejected in the case that they rewarded themselves above the current 12.5 limit?
I'm assuming that it would just be the additional amount above 12.5 because the next verification would recognize this transaction as a block reward. What are your thoughts?

Without ever seeing the process of mining a block, it isn't a detailed enough explanation (for me at least) to comprehend where these coins are coming from. Simply stating that it is a reward, doesn't explain how it ends up in the miners wallet, just the reason that it's there.
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:21:16
Yes, but it takes an enormous amount of electricity and computing power at the moment to mine a block. Typically a pool of miners will mine a block and split the reward.

Their basic app allows them to. Their "vault" and paper wallet services say they don't allow it.
@_date: 2018-08-30 18:12:03
They have a basic wallet (custodial wallet that they also control keys to) and an advanced multisig wallet which the user controls their keys. The multisig wallet can't be frozen according to them. 
@_date: 2018-08-30 17:07:55
They offer a wallet app too... so I was just answering your proclamation.

Your not getting it... the people need to choose bitcoin. A corrupt government isn't going to willingly hand over their money printer. Bitcoin offers the freedom from this.

6% is a high rate for inflation (typically 2-3% on average), however you are correct that it would need to appreciate an equal amount to be a true "store of value". 
When people refer to gold and precious metals as a store of value, I think it has less to do with the appreciation in price and more of the idea that people agree that it has value and is a flight to safety if fiat currency were ever in a crisis.
If you look at traditional investments (gold, stocks, bonds) it is difficult to beat inflation passively without exposing yourself to risk. If bitcoin were to be the standard world currency however, inflation would not exist, therefore holding bitcoin would provide a store of value.

 He has publicly stated that he believes bitcoin should be the native currency of the internet. He also owns Square, which owns Cash App and has integrated buying/selling of BTC there. I think bitcoin means more to him than a small diversification to his portfolio.

I think your taking this to literally... he was making two points. 
1. It used to be easier to buy coffee with bitcoin. Last year, more merchants accepted bitcoin and in december/January stopped because of extreme volatility and transaction fees were high.  
2. You typically lose money when you spend bitcoin because it keeps going up long term. Unless you spend and replace.

1. It's the most secure chain by far.
2. If bitcoin becomes adopted as a world reserve currency, it will be important to build on top of the bitcoin protocol rather than a competing one.
3. They want an easy money grab.

Hey, thanks! My first lightning tip!!
@_date: 2019-02-14 15:16:28
Wow... these comments 
@_date: 2019-02-14 19:00:56
I'm not debating anything about JP Morgan as a company, but it's good for the crypto space that they see enough value in the tech to implement it. I'm more just shaking my head at how extreme these comments are and how uninformed the people commenting are.
If they did any research they would see this JPM coin is run on their platform called "quorum". This is a permissioned blockchain that was forked from ethereum and is still just a prototype. The tech is very close to ethereum because they plan to implement most of the upgrades to ethereum in the future. It is probably more secure than 90% of the projects out there, although there is no denying it is centralized.
However, being that it's a fork of ethereum rather than a database built from scratch leaves open the possibility that this could be a private blockchain that can sync with ethereum in the future. It's actually very bullish for the space and very bearish for XRP as it basically replaces their entire system with a more "reputable" and proven company.
Now I want to see these systems become fully decentralized, but this is how industries are built. No company of real value is going to utilize blockchain unless they can get onboarded through a trusted party first... this provides accountability if something goes wrong. If lightning is successful, this same type of business structure would work too so bitcoiners shouldn't be too upset the largest bank in the world is using the technology.
