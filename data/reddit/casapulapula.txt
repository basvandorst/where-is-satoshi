Tell this to anyone who bought in at $19,000 during the pump-and-dump scam. Their lives were overthrown, and it´s a pretty good bet they don´t even watch this subreddit anymore.

I remember throwing money away in Brazil during the dictatorship, with inflation of 90% per month.

Did you pay for that with Bitcoins, or did you sell your Bitcoins to buy that?
@_date: 2019-02-10 09:04:54
Yes, I always take investment advice from Internet memes.
@_date: 2019-02-22 22:56:20
To the homeless shelter!

Selling before the price goes down is rational. Buying before the price goes up is rational. Rain is wet. Grass is green.

This meme should bring welcome relief to everyone who lost their ass in Bitcoin last year. /s

Before you HODL yourself into destitution, make sure you put aside enough for bus fare to the homeless shelter.

Bitcoin high, Bitcoin low, Bitcoin rising, Bitcoin falling, the message is always the same. 
@_date: 2019-02-22 21:06:50
Everyone with Bitcoins to sell will tell you the price is going up as they quietly unload their stash. It's called pump and dump.
@_date: 2019-02-12 19:00:47
In Bitcoin we trust? Ask anyone who lost their fortune in Bitcoin last year. lmao.
@_date: 2019-02-28 16:24:45
Another fancy car bought by HODLers. That is, the HODLers who bought your Bitcoins when you were dumping them. 
@_date: 2019-01-12 09:38:59
This is the exact same message this reddit always offers no matter what the Bitcoin price is and no matter in what way the price is headed. 
@_date: 2018-02-22 22:10:50
Comic probably NOT drawn by someone suckered into buying bitcoin at $19,000.
@_date: 2018-11-30 12:19:40
Pumpers gonna pump, whether they are selling their Bitcoins at $20K or at $4K. Why do you think they do that?
@_date: 2018-11-23 22:06:04
I think in terms of decades, too. Which is why I am glad I passed on all the pump-and-dump hype on this reddit that encouraged so many people to dump their life savings into BitCoin when it was at $20K. My savings are intact for decades to come.

Value is in the eye of the beholder, indeed. Try to buy US$19,000 worth of goods and services with the bitcoins you bought at that price during the pump-and-dump scam of a few months ago. 
@_date: 2018-12-12 22:50:54
Why on earth would anyone who is considering buyng something, anything, get on the Internet and try to convince others to buy the same thing, driving up the price they will pay for that thing? Unless they are not actually buying, but selling.
@_date: 2018-12-08 01:36:35
Pumpers gonna pump, while they dump their bitcoins.
@_date: 2018-12-14 21:58:21
Wait another day, it will be much lower.
@_date: 2018-12-14 22:00:32
Maybe you can sell it and make your rent this month.
@_date: 2018-12-16 12:43:19
So ... losing your life savings is the best way to to "stick it to the Fed?"
@_date: 2018-12-13 05:29:35
You'll need to buy a lot of those beers to help forget how much money you lost by investing in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-12-02 10:34:59
If that was your position in January, you lost a whole lot of money.
@_date: 2018-12-06 06:50:59
Yep, great advice for people who hate money and enjoy poverty.

"A clever way for institutional investors to fleece gullible individual investors through a social media campaign to pump up the price of the item while simultaneously dumping the item"

Imagine buying an ice cube for $19,000 and watching it melt day by day and week by week into nothing.
@_date: 2018-12-26 08:53:04
No Christmas for those who lost their life savings in Bitcoin this year.
@_date: 2018-12-07 05:43:33
If you follow advice like this, and have followed it for the past twelve months, you lost a lot of money.
@_date: 2018-12-02 10:17:22
Only people who have bitcoins to sell are interested in pumping up the price. People who are looking to buy bitcoins will do the opposite, they will attempt to drive the price down so they can buy bitcoint at a better price. Any investor should do the opposite of what is recommended by this post and others like it. The OP has been a redditor for 4 weeks, btw.
@_date: 2018-12-15 17:10:28
Will you LOL when it falls to $800 and you can't make rent? Nice two-week old account you have there.
@_date: 2018-12-15 17:11:10
Anybody still believing this?
@_date: 2018-12-14 22:03:11
If you like poverty and hate money, follow the advice of gurus like this.
