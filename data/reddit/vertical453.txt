As a journalist, you can be guaran-fucking-tee'd it was. However, you'll never-ever-ever-ever hear it.

Now let me give you a sentence. The feds don't do shit like this unless they know they'll win - and they're almost always right.

lol I fucking love Reddit. I know your post was sarcasm but look at all the people either redirecting (HSBC) or just plain saying Shrem did nothing wrong.
It's like me going to Coinbase, saying I'm about to make high volume purchases for drugs and other drug purchasers and I want a hook up and not expecting Coinbase to be arrested if they agree to it. lel
Shrem done fucked up, it's NOT good news because yet another influential Bitcoin businessperson has made himself look like an idiot and I'm starting to realize Bitcoin is going to implode on itself thanks to herp derps like him.

Half of the people on Reddit are illiterate. Reading comprehension isn't that hard...it must be the blinding light from Bitcoin's moon aspirations. 
Grow the hell up, people and read the fucking article until you understand what they're saying.

You....you're not well versed in business, are you?

What planet do you live on? Take a look at at the government's prosecution success rate and realize if charges are filed against you, you've got a slim chance of not being convicted.

Within reasonable boundaries. He's certainly not required to go all Sherlock Holmes...but when you have people flat out telling you it's for drugs and you keep selling...yeah GG no-re have fun in prison.

Are you trying to seriously say it's not illegal what he did? Try walking into a bank and saying, "I need a $50,000 loan to hire a hitman to kill my wife, please," and let me know their reaction.

Any slander suit would be done for free by any lawyer if the case was strong enough because you could get millions from a publication like Newsweek. 
Unfortunately, I don't think he was slandered. He said it was a misunderstanding, not a made-up quote.
@_date: 2014-01-27 17:21:57
If he goes directly to Silk Road to solicite customers and has specific customers TELLING him "Hey I'mma use your shit to buy drugs so I'mma buy a shit ton of bitcoin off you" and he DOES IT? Then yes...it's illegal. That's the point of the story - he did fucking know.
@_date: 2014-01-27 18:30:59
I agree with you. The war on drugs is stupid. But when you're on the bitcoin foundation board and a big player In a well known business, it's pretty elementary to understand you have to play by the rules. That's life in business. 
@_date: 2014-01-27 17:33:26
Losing battle and a waste of money. He fucked over the Bitcoin community, why would you want to donate to  that?

I don't know why you're getting down voted but you're exactly right. To put any specific expected value on bitcoin's success is nothing short of claiming to be psychic.
@_date: 2013-12-17 16:55:15
For credibility. To prevent exact situations like this.
If you let someone talk off the record they can say whatever the hell they want with no repercussions. It's bad journalism.
@_date: 2013-11-10 17:16:34
Volatility certainly is one of the biggest hindrances for bitcoin becoming a mainstream currency. The markets are young though, and the popularity boom bitcoin is experiencing is sure to cause the markets to react like this. Down the line, in years to come, things will begin to settle down as people start to understand exactly where BTC sits in the world.

Signs of a bubble  Idiots begin to ignore every logical investment strategy.

Don't listen to people who are going to come and tell you what to do with your bitcoin investments.
Also, listen to me because I have a bunch of bitcoin and don't want to see the upcoming panic sell-off happen.
@_date: 2013-11-09 22:45:17
Disclosure: I strongly believe the fundamentals of BTC are strong and am therefore bullish and long on bitcoin.
With that said, anyone ridiculing this guy for making the decision he made is not only blinded by this upswing, but an amateur to economics and likely an investment virgin.
According to his information, he made 13x gains. How many of you are close to this right now? Be honest. I'm sure there are some people on this reddit who got in early and are seeing crazy profits, but the vast majority of bitcoin investors may currently be seeing 3 to 4 times gains. This guy did way better than most of us, and that is a fact. 
Hindsight is 20/20, and all you people jumping on the ridicule bandwagon acknowledge that, except with a "but" following it. There is no but. This guy made great gains.
It's a whole separate discussion that back in 2012 BTC acceptance was no where near what it is now, but I don't think that point has to be made to show how asinine the people in that thread, and some of you here, are being. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 03:47:19
Nope. Filter to show more than .008 bets. He was betting .01 and constantly won.
@_date: 2013-11-09 23:51:51
You definitely have a point and I think we are explaining things just from different view points. 
No matter what move you make, the future could make you look like a fool, whether it's holding on to half, holding on to all or selling all.
That's all I was trying to say. Clearly up until this point "never go full fiat" has held true...but to think that will always be the case is naive. So using the word "never" is a bit strong.
@_date: 2013-11-09 23:33:18
Disagreed. You can support and believe in bitcoin but at the same time recognize that it is grossly overpriced. If bitcoin went to $1,000 tomorrow I would sell every single one I owned. That is my own subjective decision and I would see nothing wrong with liquidating it all.
It's basic economic principal...it doesn't matter how amazing you think an idea or company is, if it's overpriced, don't buy it and if you own it, sell it...yes, all of it.

I'm a journalist...I think I know the rules.
@_date: 2013-11-10 00:25:27
I believe in bitcoin but I'm not going to piss away my hard earned money to shape the future. We have totally different mindsets. I am more of a capitalist pig and you seem to be the morality police. I was once told by an investment banker, "If you invest with your heart, you're only setting up to fail."
This is a thinking man's game.
@_date: 2013-12-10 22:57:18
I highly recommend going to a local newspaper about this. It is such a perfect story in terms of being relevant to today's technology (bitcoin) and raises questions of how teachers are teaching our children.
If a reporter calls the district's superintendent wondering why a student failed a paper for being ahead of his age group, this will probably be the last time it happens.
Also, being a juvenile, I'm willing to bet the paper would be willing to offer you anonymity if all the facts check out.
@_date: 2013-11-24 14:49:07
I call BS. I had filter to show .008 bets or higher. I know all bets don't show in all bets, but what in the hell is the chance of ONLY his winning bets showing when he is, in dooglus' theory, making a TON of bets per second?
It's BS. You can tell my filter settings because his .01 bet -.01 profit bet SHOWED.
@_date: 2013-11-10 00:10:39
I personally disagree with much of Warren's investing techniques. They are flawed in many ways and try to oversimplify investing. Buying and holding forever makes no sense, for obvious reasons. We're out to make money, right?
You can invest all you want in things you believe in, but if it's at a point where the asset is overpriced you're going to take a beating that could possibly take decades to recuperate from. Price needs to be taken into account along with the underlying idea.

Is the company the same investment at $5 per share than it is at $100 per share?
No.
