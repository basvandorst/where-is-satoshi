Yes, its not a commercial thing. I wish to know if difficulty can be changed? Do I have to mine the initial coins myself or some can be premined.

I understand that. But what happens when guys with several billions worth of BTC decide to crash and burn the market at every opportunity? They just keep rising the stack for more manipulation! Do you see mass adoption as a way to cushion this effect?

Man that gives me goosebumps. What is the reason for the massive correction happening right now?
@_date: 2018-09-09 21:27:37
How to stop/lessen manipulation is my question if that can be done at all or is it not desirable?

I am aware of that. Its not necessarily commercial. Thank you for the answer. What about difficulty and preminability?

Great thing about crypto is that it is never too big to fail and it fails all the time over and over. When u leave something to the whims of open market, things correct themselves. When govt get involved, everyone gets fucked.

I hope these bitcoins are dumped fast and let the market dive violently. Let's get this Mt gox thing out of the way once and for all. One superwhale holding market to his whims is annoying.

Hope it's not a bullcrawl.

I feel with passing time, more and more stores will start to accept btc specially if it is seen as a valuable asset worth a lot of money. Of course the transaction time needs to be substantially brought down.

Let's get to 10k this week and ath eoy. All these figures are bullcrawl. If btc goes to 20k this year we can all breathe a sigh of relief and it will be a sign of trust in the market.

I think its a statement to please your wish fulfillment inner self that regulates happiness and tracks your status in the economic hierarchy of your sorroundings.
