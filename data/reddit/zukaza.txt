Shameless plug here but relevant,  is my way of letting off steam and incorporating Bitcoin, crypto, and everything in between into barely humorous tweets.

Thanks for the update! I should've changed my response once I saw Mrglaze's response yesterday. Though it could be been the initial volume of transactions they received which revealed the bug ;).

You're welcome to cover your eyes and ears but the fact remains, bitcoin does not exist in a vacuum. An uncountable amount of variables are always in play that either clash with or compliment bitcoin. I don't understand this strict "bitcoin" needs to be in the article clause. 
Common sense should kick in when an article is relevant by association. Bitcoin is a financial instrument (and much more), so why is it surprising when people post articles on failing financial regulation, gross inflation, etc., all issues Bitcoin and it's underlying philosophy are trying to combat?
Logic aside, if the upvotes outweigh the downvotes, then clearly these type of posts are welcome on the sub.

Sorry but your premise is flawed and thus so is the entire tirade you went on. Those that care about what Bitcoin stands for aren't selling it to others, they are educating them. Awareness is very important if the masses are to learn about anything. Are you selling sex to a teenager when you're educating him about it and the safe practices that go with it, are you evangelizing it? No... You're doing the kid a favor he'll likely thank you for. Education about an idea and the immaterial token that represents it is not goofy, its not uncouth, it's taking initiative where others will not. 
@_date: 2014-12-14 22:23:42

Crazy pushing... That's an arbitrary standard if I ever saw one.  I push bitcoin where it's relevant, and since money is half of every transaction, I do it often. So far no one has shunned me, in fact, most now own bitcoin and are glad I brought it to their attention. Negative posts like yours are only self fulfilling prophecies.

I agree that one of the best ways to promote bitcoin is to personally explain and expose it to others. I'd go as far to say that if every person on this subreddit exposes 5 new people a week to bitcoin it would do more than sponsoring a sport/athlete. I'm currently using bitcoin bigfoot's brochures to help me introduce strangers to bitcoin, it's quite exhilarating :).
@_date: 2014-05-24 22:22:22
No idea why you are getting downvotes. You're right in saying that objectively dogecoin has value (the fact that it has a price is proof enough). Ideally we want competing currencies anyway, why people get their Jimmies rustled over another currency speaks to some strange insecurities.

I agree with most of your statements. Im currently on my phone so I don't want to address the one contention through here. On the bright side, and in the long run. This would serve to show valve the efficiency and simplicity of transacting using bitcoin. A few will be burned as they always are for venturing into legally grey area, but if not for those, we wouldn't get to where we are as a civilization. A little broad in my conclusion but I stand by it. Keep on keeping on grey market, don't ever stop pushing the envelope as its how shit gets done around here.

The thing is the two are on different sides of the spectrum. I invest in both because I'd like to hedge against inflation in both the digital and 3d realm.

While the cynic in me agrees with you, promoting crypto currencies as a whole should be bitcoins goal. I don't think it matters where any crypto is tipped, it's either accepted by the individual, or it's not. Others shouldn't judge, but then again they are free to I suppose.
@_date: 2014-09-10 18:21:00
That's an interesting perspective. For better or worse, I'm emotionally invested in the success of bitcoin. I try and take both realistic and optimistic expectations to determine my outlook.
From the comments you've made that I can remember, I did notice your tone was apathetic towards Bitcoin, so I'm sure you understand why those with positive feelings towards Bitcoin have associated you as a negative person. 
In the end, I see no malice in your position thanks to your open and honest response. Thanks for letting me step into your shoes and seeing (somewhat) how your mind works. Cheers.

Regarding your comment about pseudonymous nature, I don't  think you're  implying the average bitcoiner does anything wrong with their bitcoins, but it should be noted that the average person thinks privacy isn't important as long as "safety" is provided. Bitcoin would be more popular if the layman understood personal responsibility is a more conducive to a better society than delegating as much as possible to an authoritative figure.

Please don't be discouraged by the downvotes,  I agree with your points. Quite frankly, the status quo will always be the common enemy to positive (and negative) change.

If you're ceding that more people would find bitcoin useful than not, then we're looking at an "objectively" useful technology. That immediately makes your statement about "subjectivity" false. Also, it's about context, you used evangelist in a negative sense as to align bitcoin proponents as more fanatical than reasonable.
@_date: 2014-12-02 02:06:08
That's the point the picture is making... Being your own leader. The kind of statements you're making are indicative of a sentiment brazenly saying "I don't want to work with anyone else to make a better tomorrow". Please wake up, you're not the only one breathing air on this planet.

You're a coward. I don't fling this word around lightly, but you're  clearly missing the point of this exercise of freedom. When Apple decided to show its true colors, iPhones became shadows of their former selves, and only exist to serve a profit margin and nothing more. Perhaps it is wasteful to destroy a phone, but I believe one should always put money where his mouth is, and this is no exception. Thousands are reading this, and those thousands will tell their friends about this. No one is alone here, but something tells me you feel otherwise. Cast away your doubt, it's a new day.

Not sure what you stand for by your statements, but I'm pretty sure changing the world for the better by changing the money paradigm isn't an unrealistic goal. 
As for price swings in either direction, as long as bitcoin is useful it will demand a price. Real life circumstances will pressure individuals to sell their bitcoins even when they don't want to. Only when the majority of markets accept bitcoin as a form of payment will we see more pressure to buy rather than sell.

It's a catch 22 scenario. Newcomers to Bitcoin will need to be supervised before swimming alone in the deep water.

No, because whether you think it's the case or not, most people who know and understand bitcoin will know what paycoin is. In my case, I know people who are into paycoin, and because I'm in the loop as to what's happening in GAWgate, I can make informed suggestions as to why they should divest from it. Since bitcoin is a currency (among other things), there is indirect relevance to other currencies.

It is decentralized enough for the purpose of unconditionally processing transactions of value. Nothing else in the market can do this as securely as bitcoin can. Should the capability mentioned above be compromised due to a scenario of not enough decentralization, the market will create another way to implement what is currently available in Bitcoin's protocol. What matters is that Bitcoin introduced the idea and realistic implementation of a decentralized clearing house and money creation protocol.

I'm not worried. The vicious circle you speak of only affects the uninformed and uneducated user. If you understand the fundamentals of economics and bitcoin you'd see contentious forks as a good thing that markets will quickly and efficiently sort out. Bitcoin or the better crypto will push forward and we'll all benefit from it.
@_date: 2017-08-22 15:03:39
A fork is not the same thing as inflation. The better analogy is how the U.S. went from gold (bitcoin) to different forms of money until it arrived at the dollar we use today. Gold is still in existence and it is not considered anywhere in the same realm as the dollar in terms of its properties and value. The dollar on the other hand...
@_date: 2017-08-19 13:24:08
It's actually not a vulnerability but a welcomed feature. More forks will inevitably come in the future, but not every fork that comes along will have close to the same following as Bcash. Thus, some future forks will be worth slivers of what Bitcoin is worth. And since Bitcoin doesn't exist in a vacuum, the market will decide where the small amount of value created by failed forks go. Either back into the crypto economy or something else. 
On the off chance a fork comes around that does everything better than Bitcoin, the community is better off for it and we'd all move on to the next generation of crypto. Forks aren't a threat, spread the word.
@_date: 2017-08-14 04:41:28
I agree with your statements. What makes me optimistic is the fact we get to watch in real time as markets voluntarily ditch "depreciating junk" for more valuable currencies in crypto as opposed to adopting currencies by mandate. Exciting times.

Don't forget to mention why people are willing to use it in trade, which is in part due to the decentralized ledgers ability to safely and reliably record transactions between parties indiscriminately. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 14:37:23
Markets are learning from what happened with Bcash. I don't think future forks will give the tokens anywhere near the price Bcash has right now unless the fork truly does something revolutionary.

This actually follows well with the monetary principle of Gresham's Law.
@_date: 2017-08-13 19:50:25
Bitcoin has proven itself to be many things besides an asset of sustainable growth and it is this culmination of positive facets that are going to continue driving adoption and innovation. I'm struggling to see how the current paradigm of exponential debt/fiat printing can even pretend to bring the same value as a mathematically provable inflation model/currency transfer system. If Bitcoin fails to further flatten the world as has the internet with its free flow of information I would be utterly dumbstruck and in search of a deep and thorough reality check.  
Full disclosure, I've believed this way before Bitcoin was worth around 4k.

I really want to start storing my bitcoins in an offline pc, but as I see more and more of these posts, I still haven't seen anyone recommend a cheap and small pc that would work well as an offline storage device. Does anyone have any suggestions?
@_date: 2013-11-17 22:15:44
Honestly this comment needs to be stickied. So many people are asking why I'd buy something with bitcoin when I could save it. Clearly the person asking the question understands bitcoin is stronger than the dollar and should be held. Although this seems to be the case, the answer to this conundrum is very easily solved. Whatever amount you spend in bitcoin, you recoup by instantly turning around and exchanging the dollars you would've spent anyway into bitcoin. Inevitably, the stronger currency, money, or commodity will be held onto over the weaker one. 
EDIT: Apparently Gresham's law describes this phenomenon spot on.
@_date: 2013-12-27 20:04:10
I would like to read those comments to better understand the context. From a "financial terrorist", as max likes to call them, perspective, there were some offices in that trade center with some of the darkest hearted people the world would ever know. Perhaps they don't deserve death, but I will say it's a tragedy that so many innocent were buried alive with those financial crooks and monsters.

This a great observation, thank you for summing these up. As for those looking to get coins during this hectic movement, might I suggest localbitcoins. I can see some of you thinking it would be too unreliable since prices keep going bonkers. But it's important to remember that no matter what the price, a bitcoin IS a bitcoin. It's the mind set you need to apply when using localbitcoins. When you find someone to buy from. Tell him/her to agree on the price with you no matter what happens within the 20 min or so drive you make to Starbucks. Reasonable people would understand that trying to get dollars for bitcoins anywhere online would take days and even more so due to the volatile times recently. This being said, level headed people do exist. Agree on a price, rendezvous, and exchange. Good luck out there friends.

There is some hard hitting evidence pertaining to why a certain part of the towers were hit. This being said, I wish 9/11 would never have happened, period. For all I know, max could completely have fallen off his rocker and is pissing on graves of the innocent. I hope that's not the case. I took sarcasm from the statement given the facts we have before us. Nobody wants another 9/11, that doesn't mean it's not likely to happen again.

Every time I see your posts they are down voted to hell.

The bank approval is in place due to compliance with federal laws. The more anonymous an exchange makes it for people to buy bitcoins, the more likely it is to have it shut down by the government.

First you have to understand what a bubble means. Bubbles can only be called such in hind sight. When the price of a stock/commodity rises, it's labeled as price discovery. Honestly there are way too many variables to pinpoint the rise in bitcoin price at the moment, but to name a few: The east's interest in bitcoins is a huge plus, as are the ATMs that are soon to be popping up around the world. You look for the bitcoin proponents behind the curtains and you'll find the reason bitcoin is steadily rising in price (in other words price discovery for now).

Fractional reserve banking is impossible with bitcoins. You can't print more of them.
@_date: 2013-12-01 15:23:22
I think most people are putting money into bitcoin because if there really isn't a major flaw in its protocol, then they've managed to find somewhere their value won't actually wither away due to inflation. With this is mind, I have even began considering gold, except with gold I couldn't have bought things online during Black Friday.

In a fiat based economy, growth is purely debt based. A by product of this system leads to needless waste of precious resources all in the name of "profit". I'd rather adhere to an economic system where society is governed under a need before greed paradigm.

Within the context of his statement, he's completely subscribing to sarcasm. As in: the next false flag will be coming soon and we should all expect it. He could be legitimately angry about the travesty that is 9/11. When dealing with truths, sarcasm is always appropriate.

Both of you are right. Sadly, unless you are well off, the option to invoke this "freedom" is little more than a dream. Anyone would love to have the option of just leaving and finding employment elsewhere in order to stay true to their convictions, but this isn't the reality.

It appears to me that we may be seeing an entirely new mindset come with the worlds embrace of bitcoin. Perhaps the idea of need vs. want is what will begin making itself more and more valuable. We will still spend our bitcoins, but I believe our worlds resources will be better allocated when the end game becomes less about profits and more about efficiency.

This is why I brought up the point of intrinsic value.

Ok I'm going to have to stop you right there. You seem to think there's a lack of capital and infrastructure in bitcoin. You couldn't be any more wrong. Think about how much processing power has gone into mining bitcoins and strengthening the protocol as a whole.
