All governments are trolls. The more powerful the country is it has the worse trolls.
@_date: 2019-03-17 21:05:22
Good luck with that
@_date: 2019-03-16 09:44:08
Yeah, that's what Bitcoin provides, relief from government trolls.
@_date: 2019-03-16 10:03:40
Well, I must say that Billy gots some potential
@_date: 2019-03-16 10:01:44
It's like selling a great idea which almost nobody heard for.
@_date: 2019-03-16 09:48:19
Well, you must be a really wise man :D
@_date: 2019-08-21 10:25:03
So, let's say I buy a hardware wallet, Ledger, or Trezor, or some other one. I write down the seed on a paper and immediately after that I destroy the wallet in a crematorium :)
Is this the safest way to HODL?:D
@_date: 2019-08-21 10:50:52
Okay let's say it's just one transaction. I write down the seed phrase from the hardware wallet, copy the public address and destroy it. After that I send just once some bitcoin amount to this public address. When I want to spend them I just use the seed phrase.
@_date: 2019-08-21 10:39:31
You said in some part:
(but keep in mind you still need to import it into some wallet, when you want to receive new bitcoin or send from your existing stash).
Now I agree with the sending part, but I think that I still can receive bitcoins without imorting my seed into some wallet, if I know at least one public address.
@_date: 2019-08-21 10:32:48
Of course I copy somewhere the address so I can send bitcoins to it whenever I want. When I want to spend them I just use my seed in some new wallet.
@_date: 2019-08-21 11:19:13
Man, I am just so sceptic xD I even sometimes think someone put cameras and microphones on insects to spy us.
This idea to create private keys by other means sounds nice. I could hire a math genius to do it on a paper and then kill him xD
@_date: 2019-08-21 10:47:06
I meant that new wallet would also be a hardware wallet :) The trick is to keep the private key not online or offline, but to keep it nowhere., to delete it and keep just the seed phrase. I was just thinking about the most safe way to keep bitcoins you know :D

I don't like the second icon, it reminds me on fiat money xD
@_date: 2019-04-10 09:03:37
Anyway, that still doesn't mean that there are 1.8 million or more people who have $1000+ of Bitcoin. You can have a bunch of addresses if you want, I for example have about 10 addresses.
@_date: 2019-09-08 18:50:59
I am serious. Are there some limits if I use just one public key?
@_date: 2019-09-08 22:50:48
Thanks, that's what I was lookin for.
@_date: 2019-09-08 19:25:55
There can be created inf. bitcoin addresses generally, I know that. But I thought is there a limit if I use one public key for creating more bitcoin addresses.
@_date: 2019-09-08 19:20:59
I know that, I am not an idiot. That's why I said I am serious.
@_date: 2019-05-12 22:30:51
I will say just one word.
@_date: 2019-05-12 22:31:20
Of my withdrawal, when I send BTC to another wallet
@_date: 2019-05-26 08:57:21
So let's say I am using Mycelium or Coinomi and that happened to me, how exactly shoud I include one of the utxos? Tell me which steps should I follow.
@_date: 2019-05-25 17:54:50
Thanks man for helping me!
It's not much money, I am just Iooking for nice desktop wallets, experimenting... I imported it to Electrum, it's good but I still think there are better desktop wallets. The lowest Bitcoin miner fee to choose on Electrum is 38sat/byte (fee about 0.7USD). I know it sounds now scrimpy:D, but I just like to have more options. You recommend any other desktop wallet?
For now Mycelium is the best mobile/desktop wallet I have used. Btw the have 3 sat/byte fees (0.05USD) :)
@_date: 2019-05-26 08:24:22
And what's usually the deadline for that. How many days or hours? I sent few satoshis few minutes ago to see what will happen. I am just curious :D
@_date: 2019-05-26 09:03:48
Okay let's say I can sweep my keys to any other wallet. Give me just the steps if you know for any wallet.
@_date: 2019-05-12 21:56:03
You don't need to "put so much hope" for prosperity in Bitcoin. We don't need hope when we are talking about technology, it will find it's way to the moon. Read about Bitcoin, figure out how it works, educate yourself and you will be 100% sure that Bitcoin will make it.
@_date: 2019-05-26 09:56:15
The 0 sat/byte miner fee transaction is confirmed. Now I saw it's confirmed. I sent it one and a half hour ago. Didn't expect it so quickly.
@_date: 2019-05-26 09:48:19
No, you are wrong I have send one hour or two ago :)
@_date: 2019-05-12 21:57:54
I know that, I have 3 options there, but I am looking for the fee percentage and IDGAF for anything else.
@_date: 2019-05-26 09:01:00
Yeah I know that, but most people don't know, they think bitcoin transactions must be expensive. That's because the trolls, you know
@_date: 2019-05-25 19:46:59
I use 3 sat/byte because that's the lowest fee on Mycelium which I use now.
@_date: 2019-05-12 22:33:52
Let's say if I want to send someone 0.1 BTC. How much percent would be the lowest fee?
@_date: 2019-05-26 08:45:08
And what should I do exactly to double spend it? I guess I should send just the same amount to the same address again, but what about the fee, should I choose again the same or a higher one?
@_date: 2019-05-25 16:47:57
I think it's not the case with Exodus. I am using Mycelium and I have there custom fees, but here I can't adjust it.
@_date: 2019-05-25 17:18:03
Just a question. Can I import it to other wallets just with the recovery phrase (12 words)?
@_date: 2019-05-15 15:51:03
@_date: 2019-05-15 15:51:12
@_date: 2019-05-26 09:50:46
You can check it here:  [ 
I commented when I done the transaction.
@_date: 2019-05-13 15:43:30
So if I understood it doesn't matter what is the amount of bitcoin which I send. It's only important which miner fee I choose. If I choose the $0.05 miner fee I will pay that fee for 0.1BTC, for 0.01BTC and 1BTC. Am I right?
@_date: 2019-05-25 17:09:51
Yep I will do that.
@_date: 2019-05-25 19:59:47
There are 3 guys with 0 sat/byte fees. I didn't know that's possible, to send bitcoin without miner fee.
