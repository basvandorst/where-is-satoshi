Honesly, Bitcoin is here used as sort of Internet gibberish/slang.
It's commercial for mobile Internet and point is that old woman in village has better "Internet knowledge" than the girl from capital who just wants honey. "Cash" is for example also not used in Czech for "cash", I'm more like slang.

Ok, I'll translate. Give me a sec.
A: Hello. 
B: Hello, hello.
A: Is that real honey?
B: Of course.
A: Nice. We'll take two.
B: Ok. 180 (czech crowns). Bitcoin, cash, paypal...
A: Honey? Two?
Narrator: You can start you enterprise anywhere now. Even in Ramtmerice (like small village noone knows).
B: And next time via eshop, "people from prague".

What about it? It's quite straight forward.

Yea, czechs are less common in czech then czechs. But you could czech with her.

Yea. And what he claims is wrong anyway.

I can't believe you are crying about single exceptional day of 15% volatility (and few seconds of more).
Do you listen to yourselves people? Have you seen Bitcoin stable chart?
@_date: 2015-01-15 13:07:05
What? Currency gained value and you're talking about loss? Heh.
@_date: 2015-01-15 15:31:40
I'm in Bitcoin. But I just can't stand this kind of criticism. Why do we criticize volatility when we have much worse one?
@_date: 2015-01-15 13:28:55
Bought with printed money. Which is free for them.
@_date: 2015-01-15 13:56:51
Why? That is how you do it. If you need to keep your currency higher (such as Russia now), it's extremely expensive as you have to use your reserves to buy your currency and remove it from circulation.
But if you want to keep it lower, you just "print" money and sell as much of your currency as necessary to get it down. By doing this you actually acquire great deal of reserves.
What is being claimed here is, that those new reserves has now lower value (in Franks) as value of Frank increased. I just fail to understand why is that important at all, let alone disaster.
I'm not going to source you why it's free of charge to print money for central bank. No.

They were stabilizing it most of all.
Switzerland is small country and frank crazy back then because of speculation.
Volatility is fun and all in Bitcoin, but disaster in national currency.

If they have keys to BCC wallet, they have keys to BTC wallet with same address. It should not be lost unless they fuck you over.

You now own both BTC and BCH. If you don't care about BCH, you can just ignore it. Alternatively you can sell it now, or just wait. If you do nothing, nothing happens to you. It would be shit system if you would have to care for your coins not to loose them.
@_date: 2017-08-03 14:45:25
Yes. They are now two separate blockchains that do not influence each other. There are some fears that your signature in BCH can be reused to send BTC as well, so first move BTC just to be sure (I'm not sure how serious this is and all they could do is send BTC to same people as BCH).

The person, my bad.
@_date: 2015-04-16 08:24:43
Listen people. This is action made by well known Czech conspiracy theorist Vit Jedlicka.
If you have to jump into each "let's propagate bitcoin everywhere", you'll just end up being associated with weird people like this.
This is why I'm holding few coins, but I'm generally bearish on the whole think. For stuff like this.

Also, President is not Libertarian. He is straight out conspiracy blog author.

When you have hammer, everything looks like a nail.
VR and Bitcoin has nothing together.
@_date: 2013-12-03 12:59:05
Exactly. I can't make OTR, therefore I don't. I'm not going to create insecure product and market it as secure.

I don't think that model failed. It's more like Dread Pirate Roberts failed.
