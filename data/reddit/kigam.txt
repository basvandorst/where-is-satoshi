And if you run 100 VMs they will all be using storage and bandwidth for this.  And each VM is compensated for its storage and bandwidth. But with the same storage and bandwidth and no VMs you would get compensated the same. So there is no financial incentive for this. Sure you could trick the system into thinking it was 100 computers. But who cares the system gets exactly the same resources from the 1 computer or the 100 so it does not matter.  The system is paying for storage and bandwidth not for # of computers. 
@_date: 2014-04-11 05:43:03
Not if each 100 computers were supposed to hold different sets of information. Then you cant produce the valid hashes.

And the other thing I'd like to add is that bitcoins ARE worth something - they are worth whatever someone is willing to pay you for them.

stupid post taking the comment out of context.  When he says "offline" here, he means not on a pull request thread - he even mentions taking it "offline" to irc - which could presumably mean a open public logged channel

website down?
@_date: 2011-07-06 18:21:12
you would have to make the total hash rate of the network trend down for the entire duration of the previous difficultly to make it go down.  Basically difficulty is linearly related to network hash rate.  So if the average over the previous difficulty period is above the current difficulty, then it goes up, if it's below, it goes down.  It's a shit load of a DDOS, and that's assuming that the miners don't go mine elsewhere, pool or no pool
@_date: 2011-07-07 21:05:09
the miner computing his block hash chooses which transactions to include in his block - typically I would assume the algorithms will take a transaction with a fee over one that has none

not sure if bitcoincharts is getting a mini-ddos with all the people trying to grab data, but I was seeing a lot of 502 Bad Gateways on their site, and my sierra chart feeds were also seeing 502's - but bitcoinity seemed to update at least once a minute or so with new data....
what I can't explain is I've seen it happen at least twice now, but the depth chart on bitcoinity specifically the bids around $10-$10.25 - i've seen jumping by huge numbers, it **looks** as if someone is pulling their bids around $10 ( about 10-14k BTC worth of bids ) and then pushing them back on later.... it's just odd, dunno if it's a network issue or data reporting issue, or if it's real

I thought the newest version of guiminer has fallback pools?  Don't quote me on that though, I don't use guiminer
@_date: 2011-07-05 19:00:44
almost a 10k BTC high wall at $10, I wonder if this trend will break that wall.... once it passes that, who knows how low it can go....
on the flipside, anyone who buys a lot right now could easily push the price back to $13's - only 2-3k BTC needed to get back there, and only 5k back to $16...
of course this is all ignoring any darkpool volumes
@_date: 2011-07-05 19:10:46
I think a bit of that, mixed with a bit of people cashing out large  of coins
all it takes is one big transaction and a big price change, and people react emotionally to the swing and make drastic decisions, further fueling the swing and more reactions
@_date: 2011-07-05 19:34:28
and now some huge buys bring it back to 12.5.... interesting..... this market is so volatile
@_date: 2011-07-05 22:40:31
so what you are saying is the mining pool operators are the ones raking in the BTC?
@_date: 2011-07-07 21:30:54
but what benefit is spending $100 to prevent someone else from producing $1000 ? I guess you can temporarily bring down the miner BTC income, but are you saying that that may affect the market prices?  I'm not quite sure how paying $100 to prevent someone else from getting $1000 would help here in the grander scheme of things.
I think the only other explanation I can think of other than spite, is exploration/experimentation.  Nobody knows how people are going to react to a shit-load of pools being down, maybe it's market manipulation through experimentation.  See what happens, see how people react, and then once you clearly understand how the market will react, capitalize on that knowledge added with the power to start the DDOS when you want to.
@_date: 2011-07-05 22:41:55
yeah I'm not sure who in their right mind would sell a BTC for $0.00.  I mean I know how many BTC I'd buy @ $0.00 - infinity of them ( or rather the 21 mil cap, or realistically any single one I could get my hands on )
@_date: 2011-07-05 19:23:35
23k BTC in standing orders to break $10 - that'd be a huge selloff if it got there
but we may see it get tested... only 2k BTC to break $11, and then another 2k to get to $10.25 - then there's a huge ~20k wall to break $10
@_date: 2011-07-05 19:22:02
oh I didn't know or hear about that, interesting
@_date: 2011-07-06 01:56:05
I could possibly see some short term gain by reducing network hash rate to retarget difficultly lower, or even just not increase difficultly by that much.  But I imagine that's damn near impossible to do by DDOSing a pool - all the pool miners will just jump to other pools.  I guess if you could DDOS all the pools you might have a chance?  But again, the miners would react, and if all the pools were down, then they would start solo mining.
But still, it'd have to be quite an attack - they would need to be DDOSing major hashrate sources for the majority of the difficulty period....
I'm almost thinking the only reason it's been happening is spite/revenge/trolling, as I can't imagine what kind of monetary gain you could actually get out of this.

VPSes for bitcoins IMO - we really need services for people to spend bitcoins on, and the techy nature of most bitcoin enthusiasts would fit well with this type of service

the bubble has burst, and this is it's death march out
@_date: 2011-07-06 18:23:28
yeah exactly what he said.  Another way to think of it, every "miner" is essentially flipping a coin ( the coin's chances of a favorable outcome are really really really fucking low tho - but that's besides the point ) - just for argument's sake, lets say it's a regular 2-sided coin, you have 50% chance to flip a heads.  What's the chance of your next flip being heads?  What's the chance of your next flip being heads if 1000 people are also flipping coins?  What's the chance of your next flip being heads if 1000000 people are also flipping coins? Your chances are exactly the same
@_date: 2011-07-06 18:25:28
estimated difficulty is still an increase over this round's - currently estimated 1566052 in 14 blks
@_date: 2011-06-30 22:21:56
without incentives to mine, less people will mine, which leads to a situation where it's much easier to obtain more than 50% of the hashing power.  With more than 50% of the hashing power you can do some weird things with the transactions you include.  I don't know the specific finer points of it, but I imagine you'd be able to double spend coins at the worst, and re-order transactional history at the least.
Miners need an incentive otherwise the above situation occurs
@_date: 2011-07-06 01:52:36
DDOSing a pool has absolutely 0 effect on your own mining rig's generation rates, so I find it a hard sell that this would be the case, or there are some stupid criminal type hackers out there who don't understand bitcoins mechanics
@_date: 2011-07-06 18:23:41
yeah, or mine solo

Why would a loan require a positive interest rate?  In my mind you would have sub-zero interest that was still above the expected deflation
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:38:14
would it be more like a supply/demand situation then? Where you want/need the exchange to occur now, whereas the HFT can decide whenever it wants to trade especially with it's assumed capital/assets?  You are completely capable of waiting out for the "best" moment just as the HFT is, the HFT just has more resources/time/reaction time/calculations/info to do it with.
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:34:19
and when HFT's will install brand new fiber lines across the ocean to shave off milliseconds of communications lag, you could see why building custom silicon to implement trading algorithms might start making sense

problematic if you use those existing coins in transactions because you may eventually generate new keys for change that are not contained in those backups....

not entirely true... a two week burn in does seem a bit excessive, but it's very common to at least burn in for say 1-3 days.  And burn-in is even more important because these things aren't really mass produced.

I agree, but everyone seems focused on delivery confirmation as a means of never getting a transaction reversed....
@_date: 2013-04-13 21:08:30
I guess since deflation may not always be guaranteed it still might make sense if the uncertaintity of deflation is in the range of that 0% it might make sense as a hedge?
@_date: 2013-10-04 20:18:53
@_date: 2013-04-13 18:12:24
As I posted in the other thread, why can't a loan have a negative interest rate?  10% deflation with a -5% interest rate would be like a 5% interest rate with 0% deflation. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 01:05:52
only problem I see with this is you need highly skilled developers with a keen eye for security.  Actually more problems than that.  To handle that amount of money I'm sure you would need to register a company as some sort of money broker.  Probably would need deposit insurance, etc....
these are some pretty big hurdles to overcome, that I don't think a "hobby" or project like this could overcome, and we definitely don't need any more security vulnerable places where BTC are stored to get hacked....
@_date: 2013-04-13 20:29:26
Why?  After a year btc has deflated by 10% meaning that 10 btc is now worth 9 btc before time. So they would be repaid 9.5 btc which is worth more than 10 btc a year ago

@_date: 2013-06-17 23:25:39
Not true. And definitely not true of my companies non massed produced $40k systems we sell. So its really not a hard sell for me to imagine burning in a $6k system.  And even more so if you are using any custom built or proprietary hardware, or anything not tried and true "off-the-shelf" h/w.  And even more so when you consider the thermal cycles that these chips will undergo.

the order book is the list of open orders on the books at that moment.  If someone places a limit order to sell 3.78 BTC at $135, then it would show up on the orderbook as an ask at $135 showing a volume of 3.78 BTC.  Same goes for buy/bid orders.
bitcoin.clarkmoody.com shows the order book under the price graph.  At any moment in time you can see the open orders on the books.
What might have happened was there was a large bid order at $138.5 of more than 1258 BTC.  Then when someone puts in a sell order at $138.5 for 1258 BTC the market does not move at all - all that happens is that the open bid gets taken out.
Alternatively on bitcoinity, you should be able to see the effect of this open order on the bottom graph of bitcoinity.  It would show up as a short vertical line on the green line.  Any quick vertical jumps would look similar to the one I'm guessing got eaten by that sell order.  Some people call these "walls"
