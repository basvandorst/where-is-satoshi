Yeah don't use bitfinex. Better off using an exchange with a USD pair because then you can actually sell when it all goes to shit. The thing about that is that Bitfinex has so much money that this could take a really long time. I've also started studying the arbitrage in the cryto environment and it's possible that despite all this the market might not actually care enough about this that the market collapses at all. It's really hard to guess. What I've done is reduced my holdings to a percentage of my net worth I'm comfortable losing but if it skyrockets first I'll still be making nice gains.        
USDT doesn't really impact withdrawal times. Exchanges will say whether the trading pair is USD or USDT so you know what you're holding. The price of USDT will drop, if 1USDT is worth 0.10USD then it will cost 10x more USDT to buy bitcoin and it'll appear that the price is high when it's not. But it's probably going to take some time for the market to realise USDT is losing value so the USD bitcoin price will likely go up with it for at least some time.

If you hold Tether on any exchange you've agree to Tether's TOS.
The value of tether would go close to 0 because some people will speculate/gamble that they can get the money. That's why the price of bitcoin will appear to skyrocket with any USDT pair when in actual fact it's USDT's value declining. Doesn't matter what exchange you're on.

Mining difficulty follows the price of bitcoin and reward for mining a block. Revenue probably won't be that different compared to what is it now, relative to how much you invest in ASIC hardware available at the time.

I remember there being significant hype in the Wall Street investor community about Bitcoin from around $30 to when it hit $260 during the start of last year. So they were definitely around and aware of bitcoin at that time.

On just one trading platform, not very much. We saw a $100 flash crash on Coinbase yesterday which was from only 265 bitcoins (~$140,000). Causing a flash crash in a market with small liquidity isn't hard.       
If you want it to be a long lasting effect then my guess would be that it'd take many millions of dollars, if not hundreds, spread over a long period of time.

Realistically, majority of companies would be decades away from offering the option of paying employees in bitcoin, not to mention the massive leaps bitcoin needs in adoption. Amazon is much closer to adding bitcoin payment, possibly a few months, given the right pressure. This is a good short goal which would contribute to adoption.
@_date: 2013-05-22 04:48:54
Facebook hit 1 million users in 10 months, although bitcoin is growing at an increasing rate, at the moment there's only about 150k-200k active users (an estimation I came up with taking into consideration the bitcoin wallets containing 1btc or over and bitcointalk accounts, could be off). It might be possible for bitcoin to reach 1 million users by the end of this year and grow a lot faster from then on it will be a massive stretch to match that of facebook. It will probably follow a comparable adption path (an S-Curve) in the longer term though.

It's near impossible to keep everyone happy but aren't there things that your government contributes to society that you find beneficial? My government does a pretty good job with the education system and crime fighting for example and I don't think would be possible if people got the option to not pay tax (or just decided not to). I'm not sure what the situation is with your government but in my case I definitely feel the pros outweigh the cons of the government having tax money to spend.
@_date: 2013-05-15 04:42:34
Doesn't mean they can't ruin bitcoin just by pumping money into it or restricting it's use. I'm not saying it's going to happen, just that it's a possibility and this restriction of dwolla transactions with mt. gox could just be one of many stepping stones. It's just something people investing in bitcoins should take into account. Doesn't mean you shouldn't buy more bitcoins. I probably will.
@_date: 2013-05-15 15:44:07
The government being or not being confident in bitcoin seems irrelevant. I'm not really sure what you mean by that? I doubt they'd make Bitcoins illegal, I never said anything about illegal. I was only saying the government destroying bitcoin confidence could be a possibility and which was why I was wondering why you took this dwolla news as the biggest news that bitcoin will succeed? Also it's not necessary to ridicule me. I'm just trying to have a constructive agruement.
@_date: 2013-05-20 04:37:05
I've got to point out, this is the noobiest question I've seen. That being said I'm not going to lie, I've thought it to myself a few times too. I'll just going to shed how I've thought about it; if you want to be a millionaire you have to risk quite a lot. The early adopters, which may already be millionaires, took on a lot more risk with to make a larger profit percentage but since bitcoin has become more mainstream it will be difficult to make millions from just a few bitcoins. Although it's still quite new, and in my opinion looks quite promising, you won't get rich from buying 10 bitcoins (but you may make some nice profit). If you do want to contribute to the bitcoins increasing price though you should not only invest in some but also have some for spending. That will probably be the main contributing factor to bitcoin succeeding in the long term, and you can be a part of it! If everyone is buy and holding bitcoin will struggle in the long term.

Good short term, very bad long term. They will give better returns than ASICMiner shares for at least a couple of years I'd say. After that, they will be worth next to nothing. So you'll have to try time selling them at not too much of a loss, which might only be a year from now. Could be more/less though.

Doesn't Friedcat have 210k of the 400k shares? If so and that's the number going to the remainder 190k shares then it's 0.02759/shares. Seems a bit high but still possible.

I invested in some Asicminer shares the other day an have done a little research on it. Their dividends fluctualate a bit seem to average around 0.01BTC per share every week (around 34% return per year at price of 1.5btc) at currenct prices. Which is huge investment-wise! I was concidering investing more money today but after some thought decided it was very high risk and I wasn't prepared to lose much more than I already had in there.

I've been thinking a lot about you're points and just came back to reply. I even watched a relevant movie to the topic called Animal Farm (from George Orwell's book) which I would definitely recommend you watching. Not to use the movie to dissuade you from your belief, I just think the ideas that George Orwell brings up are important to take into consideration if you're picking a stance on this topic at all. Also if you do watch it, take it with a grain of salt. I'd love for you to get back to me on your opinion on it as well!  
Getting back to it, I definitely see where you are coming from on this topic but after thinking a lot about it don't share the same belief that a straight up anarchy would be successful, long term. In reply to your edit, I'm not one to judge you for having that belief, quite the opposite. I promise I'm not "using this "debate" as a smokescreen for what [I] really want". I have no ulterior motives. I found this debate really enlightning and I apprcieate the time you put into replying rather than just downvoting me or telling me I'm an idiot.   
All that being said I do believe there has to be a better system then we have now though, which may not change in our lifetime by it will change in the future, for sure, and we need conflicting opinion to facilitate that change.

For the price to start jumping back up a lot more fiat money would have to be traded for bitcoin. At the moment it's mostly day traders trading with each other (figured this from bitcoin days destroyed not increasing much over the last couple of months). There's not enough interest at the moment to sustain $100+ coins so the price is dropping. If you think interest is going to increase a lot very soon, buy. If you think interest will not increase very much in the months to come wait to buy.    
I'm hoping it goes down to $30 (a purely speculative number) before interest catches up with the price. I will buy more then. If not then I'll just have the coins I already have, which are invested in stocks.
@_date: 2013-05-22 14:55:47
You would say that! Exactly when you're hoping to pick up some cheap ones a wild bubble appears... :/
@_date: 2013-05-22 07:23:16
Bitcoin's aren't meant as a tool to tax evade. People have always been able to tax evade. Using bitcoins to accomplish it might be easier but it's not necessary and is likely to do more damage, to the future of bitcoin and crypocurrencies, than it's actually worth.
@_date: 2013-05-25 05:20:19
I'm not sure if that was the actual reason for the transactions confirming. Transactions are confirmed by the network and doesn't depend on the client after you've send the coins. It will be up to miners to confirm the transaction, it's even possible it could never be confirmed in which case it will be 'sent back' to the sender, although technically the sender hasn't sent it until it's been confirmed. At least that's my understanding of how it works.    
So poisonmike87 will just have to be patient. There's nothing he can do while waiting for it to confirm.

Also from what I've read about him he doesn't seem like he was very concerned about profitting from Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-06-03 18:09:28
You're almost definitely better off using money to invest in bitcoins and buy miner shares on exchanges like btct.co.  
ASICMiner is currently giving the best returns. If you want to look for upcoming comanys which might offer more profit (but higher risk) bitfunder.com has more variety.
@_date: 2013-06-27 15:19:51
That's good to hear. I guess I'm just a bit skeptical with the recent MiningUnited and Pirate40.
@_date: 2013-05-16 04:10:44
Well what I had thought would be the Government could use large amounts of money and do a pump and dump kind of thing, buying up and then cause panic sells on a regular basis which would make it extremely volatile and scare people away from bitcoin as a currency. I'm not saying that I've done research on this, I just thought it was a possibility. I'm open to be proven wrong, I'm still pretty new to bitcoin. But wouldn't banning/cencoring also be a strong weapon against bitcoin? As I see it it's already quite difficult to get into using bitcoins, restricting that further would lower demand in the long term. I don't see how the action to harm bitcoin (restricting it) would make it more valueable like what you're saying.

@_date: 2013-06-27 15:36:58
Pirate40 was the first major scam artist in bitcoin when it was still relatively new. His influence actually caused the market to crash over the period of a week, it's quite interesting how he did it actually. If I've read correctly he returned every single bitcoin but his influence crashing the bitcoin market earn him lots of USD. Basically he borrowed everyone's bitcoins promising a high return (straight up ponzi) but the thing he did differently was that he sold everyone's coins slowly. Then said something along the lines that the fund wouldn't work out and returned everyone's coins across a week. This caused everyone to cash out as soon as they got their coins. So he could buy back the next days return at a much cheaper price than he sold them for. Basically the people who got their coins back at the end of the week and sold then got screwed.  
Mining United was a more recent one around May this year. I was skeptical but also intrigued by it and lost 0.05 bitcoins in the end.
EDIT: added the pirate story.
@_date: 2013-05-21 02:33:03
Stocks are traded on exchange, unlike ponzi schemes like the most recent MiningUnited and pirate40 for example. They make no promises for the dividends rather than distributing a percentage of their profits for that week.  
I'm not sure where it sounds like a Ponzi scheme but good on you for being cautious.

I have no idea if she cared or not, that's why I'm asking how do I make someone I don't know interested... She probably didn't care after what I said though. It'd be nice to have an explaination that's more likely to spark an interest.  
Edit: Also I work in a job with a similar amount of contact with customers. I wouldn't be likely to ask the something unrelated like she did without being genuinely curious so I think it's pretty safe for me to assume she was at least that.
@_date: 2013-05-23 02:21:49
Ok I feel like I should take back "bitcoin is not meant to be used for tax evasion" and instead say that bitcoin is more likely to grow faster if it is not being used to tax evade.   
This is kind of starting to look like a bible reading in the way that we reading a quote from someone who may or may not know what they're talking about and we could both be misinterpreting it, but it doesn't really matter. Sometimes you just need to step back and try to think about it logically. Even if Satoshi himself said use bitcoin to tax evade, doesn't necessarily mean you should or it will be the best thing for it.   
I'm going to use something I heard about a quote in the bible the other as an example. There's a part that clearly says that if a woman breaks up a fist fight between two men by grabbing one of the males testicles, you should punish her by cutting one of her arms off... Anyone can realise that this isn't the right thing to do. Maybe there's some similarities between that and bitcoin/cryptocurrency tax evasion.  
Edit: fixed bible quote
@_date: 2013-05-14 10:13:32

@_date: 2013-05-25 11:54:42


FTFY.  
Edit: Probably not. You'd be better off investing bitcoins in share PT's that pay weekly dividends (some pay monthly) at sites like btct.co or bitfunder.com. AsicMiner pass-through shares are currently paying out the best dividends. Btct.co is the quickest to set up if you already have the bitcoins. Bitfunder is generally a little cheaper though. Or if you don't want to invest buy and hold might even be a better investment than risking waitingg a very long time for butterfly labs.   
Another alternative could be trying go in on a group buy for some of Friedcat's ASIC's but I don't have much information about them.

You may be good with your money but majority of people would probably just waste the cash they'd normally pay taxes with and then they'd be less happy because they would have the same amount of money but with none of the benefits of the government supplies.

I was serious about losing coins too though it wasn't to a Nigerian prince. I don't have any smart ideas on how to get bitcoins in America, I live in Australia and I use spendbitcoins.com to buy mine which is super easy. Also be careful with bitcoins on ebay. It's usually a bad combination.
@_date: 2013-05-14 14:25:02
Both bitcoins and asicminer are very new and aren't sure to survive in the long term (though it's possible they will and you may become rich if you invest everything you have now). It's also possible the website you bought the shares on could fail...
Because of that you should only invest what you can look back on and accept that you made the right choice investing that amount even if you happen to lose it all.
I'm not saying they're not a good investment. I'm saying they are a high risk investment and if you're going in for the long term no one can know what will be of bitcoins and asic miner in 10 years. Basically it's a good idea to invest, it's a bad idea to gamble money you can't afford to lose.

I'm surprised at how defensive you've gotten over such a small issue. Thanks for the informative parts, I appreciated that, but the other parts were just a waste of time. I'm just going to assume I'm not the real problem here and you have something else frustrating you in your life right now. Otherwise you're a dick. I am young and don't deny that you know more than me but you handled this discussion like a baby. Pointing out that I'm young and telling me I'm stupid contributes nothing to the arguement and is irrelevant. Do the bitcoin community a favour and try to take things a bit less personally next time.

I realise we have quite different views on this and I'm not going to persuade you but I'm not sure the US (assuming that's where you live? Could be wrong) will be ready to be function without the state for quite a while. Until then I also don't think the state is permitting us to use bitcoin so much as not using restrictions to slow it's increasing growth. And I can see no reason why the first thing the would try to attack bitcoin when they realise people are using it to tax evade, rather than realising and make progress with the real issues, like you said they may be collapsing and becoming unnecessary.

I'm pretty sure all they they would be able do is increase volatility by a [pump and dump]( sort of thing. Maybe over a long time this could have some effect by decreasing confidence at the current market cap, but the bitcoin market is growing and by the time the government might even consider doing such a thing it will probably be too big for them to have any negative effect on the bitcoin market at all, it may even be beneficial by increase liquidity. It will probably not be worth it and they won't bother.   
The government's likely just to accept bitcoin is here and move on. Might try to regulate it but it won't be effective due to bitcoin's nature.

That is what I meant, obviously you can't shut it down like a computer. I'm just saying that Bitcoin isn't invulnerable.

I've been doing some research on this the last couple of months and surprisingly the answer is yes. It's quite a simple process actually. First you take the total number of bitcoins days destroyed (filtered by minimum age of 1 year) and divide it by the total transactions done in the last quarter. Multiply it by potato and subtract the onion. Don't forget to carry the one! And there you have it. Oh wait...   
TL;DR Nope.

Bitcoins aren't like drugs, they depend a lot on their usability. If you restrict how useful they are for spending then their price will drop, they will not become more scarce and go up in price (like drugs) if you restrict them. People have to be confident in bitcoins for it to be worth anything, the government could use their money to destabilise the market and destroy confidence in the currency. If an increase amount of people use it for criminal activity (tax evasion or buying drugs) it may become in their interest to do so. Although it's unlikely at this point it'd be naive to not take that into account when buying bitcoins. That's pretty much my point... I was just telling people to be aware that bitcoins aren't risk free, that's all.

You don't mean market share as in the amount of people that use bitcoin, do you? It's very unlikely Bitcoin's user growth can come close to matching Facebook's.
@_date: 2013-05-23 01:58:02
It's more common sense, how could passive aggressively evade tax solve anything?   
Edit: I just realise I'm making a huge and likely false assuming your using bitcoin as an investment and evading tax on capital gains rather than an attempt at a crypto anarchy... Sorry :(

No tax means no government, do you believe our can function without government?   
How would we still have a defensive force, jails and public schools just for starters? I can't see the 'paying for the services if you need them' approach being effective. All I can see is that a lot of things the government give us which we benefit from would be gone. The negative things would be gone too but isn't there a better way of getting rid of that rather than just removing tax and all the benefits of governement altogether?    
I've had this discussion with a couple of people on reddit already but they've just ended up getting annoyed at me and telling me I'm an idiot rather than explaining where they're coming from. It's like telling someone who's never heard of bitcoin they're an idiot for leaving all their money in a high interest account instead of investing in bitcoin...

Interpreting that as forbidden government from collecting tax from you is a stretch, I feel. It's definitely debatable whether government could ever become unecessary in the future (I'm not really commenting here to discuss politics though, not that I know that much about it) but as it stands now the only likely thing to happen if too many people decide that they now have bitcoins and "it's their right to tax evade using it" is conflict causing damage to the bitcoin growth, which is in no way worth the exta bucks you could get out of it but also risk getting fined from regulations.    
If you don't like your government then using bitcoin for ILLEGAL activity to go against the government is not productive and is kind of passive agressive. Bitcoin doesn't need tax evasion to help go against governments. It will most likely do that in a more productive way over time if it grows by showing the government that a lot of people as seeking refuge from them in crypto-currency and they will be more likely to come up with reasonable non-agressive solutions to this if it doesn't have the negativity from illegal active like drugs, money laundering and tax evasion. More effectively so without being used for illegal activity.   
The way it looks to me, using bitcoin to tax evade is selfish. If you want to tax evade it's your choice but there's no need to potentially damage bitcoin by using it as a tool.

Yes, this. Bitcoin will not solve any problem you have with the government if you try to use it against them.

I remember reading there will be further profit from sales included in this dividend so I'm going to take a guess at 0.018/share.

I think it was 20,000BTC. And if I'd done that I wouldn't regret it at all, it was a big step for bitcoin and was definitely worth it at the time.
@_date: 2013-05-30 04:50:25
Nope. It's gone, sorry bro.   
And when I say gone I just mean it's not uncommon for a transaction with no tx fees to take over 24 hours. Just be patient. :P   
If it takes longer than that then there's a possibility it won't enter the blockchain and will just stay in the original wallet. Not sure how long it takes to get to that point though? I think I remember reading ~3 days but I wouldn't quote me on that.

Yeah, I've never used electrum before (I've heard it's good though) but it should definitely have a box to check for including tx fee in a transaction. That'd make situations like this easily avoidable. Having coins in unconfirmed limbo is never fun.

It's not a bad idea to buy asic miners, but it's most likely a bad idea to PRE-order an asic miner off of butterfly labs (their orders a backed up like you wouldn't believe).
The company AsicMiners are the most reliable source of decent quality ASIC hardware at the moment. They auction off most of their hardware at bitcointalk.com which they've already tested and is basically ready to ship. It would not be idiotic to buy hardware from them in the same way it would not be idiotic to buy their shares.   
Also their sales aren't the only contributing factor to their share price, share prices rise and fall from supply and demand. But there sales will increase dividend which would in turn increase demand. So following the changes in the dividend payouts would make more sense on determining how much profit they are making from sales (which aren't necessarily to idiots, or they can't be classified as an idiot for purchasing ASIC hardware off of AsicMiner).   
Edit: better wording
@_date: 2013-05-29 15:04:39
Oh, yeah you must be right. That's got to be just be the mining portion of the dividend.
