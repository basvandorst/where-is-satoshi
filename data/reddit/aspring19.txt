Sorry for late response, I haven't been on reddit for a few days.


"For the bitcoin user, ... have Netflix send me an invoice / statement and if it is for the agreed upon amount, I'll pay the bill (push)",
yes, there's a more convenient way to do that as well...

So, customers/bitcoin users would do bitcoin stuff via such custodial service?
If such service is cheap, safe and easy to use an average person may want to use it.

Can you explain technically how it can be accomplished?  I'm just curious.
Regarding use case, the * when you shop at a grocery, and say, they scan your bitcoin address on a card. * is one.  
If this is doable, it would encourage merchants to adopt Bitcoin ( add Bitcoin as another form of payment ) but of course currently the low transaction volume of Bitcoin ( 7 transactions per second ) is not practical for many businesses.

Sorry for late response.
Yes, for multiple cases,
* when you shop at a grocery, and say, they scan your bitcoin address on a card.
* for the merchant to periodically pull the agreed upon amount from the customer's bank / debtor card for things like such as subscription or auto installment payments etc.
