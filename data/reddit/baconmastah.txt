You can thank Jihan and Roger Ver for that. It was supposed to come in 2017, but Segwig 2x attacks delayed it by a year. Congratulations, you lot burned a significant amount of Bitcoin development resources just to support a hard fork that was later discovered to be doomed to fail.    
As for Lightning Network? It's coming. Notice how suddenly progress resumed after S2x failed. We are seeing actual transactions taking place. This is the real deal.   


Not at all. BCH's trading volume's a fraction of BTC's and it uses 8mb blocks and yet--*it's already running into challenges.* That's a huge, huge red flag.
Again, don't place your faith in snake oil salesmen. Your boss probably doesn't hire former convicts. Mine doesn't either. And I would never hire someone or invest in someone who got deported for engaging in mountains of ponzis.

The minute they do that, Jihan and his mining cabal lose control of Bitcoin Cash. BCH just becomes a less shitty Bitcoin clone. It's still lipstick on a fucking swine.

@_date: 2018-01-20 02:19:00


That's cute. I remember when my state spent a fortune adding extra lanes to the 405 freeway in response to complaints about traffic. All traffic did was increase.  
And that's the problem I see with ginormous blocks. Even at 8mb blocks and a fraction of Bitcoin's traffic, your mempool gets easily clogged. WTF? That's a huge inefficiency. You don't need seasoned developer to tell you that's the worst possible way to resolve scaling issues.  
Bitcoin Cash has done absolutely nothing to impress me. If increasing the block size **yet again** (no...it's not a rumor) is Jihan's only solution, boy oh boy I sure hope you don't have plans to hold your bags for more than a couple more months.
@_date: 2018-01-30 21:51:55
Those are 3 of my personal favorites. None of those 3 need any further introduction as all 3 have been around a while and have solid developer teams. Ethereum in particular is by many accounts probably going to have a fantastic year. [This guy]( just did a video on why (not a half bad channel, started following him recently). A lot of ICOs launching on ETH's platform and those same ICOs require payment in ETH, so expect Ethereum to hit that $1,500 price point soon. And yes, I include Bitcoin in the mix since I truly feel it can only go up from here, Bitcoin hate and FUD be damned.  
Aside from those 3, it's really on you to find coins that you truly believe have promise. Read their whitepapers. If you have the time and money to burn, try visiting a few events where the developers of the coins are going to be present. Or go to networking events (I have a few in my area I plan to visit). Carter Thomas from [Coin Mastery]( (another great channel, recommend him) has been recommending looking at coins in the top 30 on coinmarketcap.com since those by now are going to include ones with promising futures. I'm not saying other coins outside the to 30 won't do well, but if you're like me and you don't have time to read 1,500 whitepapers, that's the first place to start.  
I'm no Bitcoin hater. At the same time, I'm not in the camp that believes Bitcoin will hit $100,000 this year. I guess I'm somewhat of an in-betweener? Even if you find a lot of alts that you've fallen in love with, I'd still recommend keeping at least 20% of your portfolio in Bitcoin. You can use the Bitcoin to buy up alts when some FUDy event tanks them temporarily. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 20:38:28

I've always been keeping BTC at roughly a % of my portfolio. I'm still confident it'll reach 20,000, possibly even way north of that later going into this year. It's not a bad price at this point, but some people are anticipating it bouncing off the $9k zone a couple more times. So buy now?

China's not the only reason Bitcoin and alts in general shat the bed. It contributed a bit and I'd argue it's why Neo slowed down. But it's a combination of a lot of factors. In general, this is a long term bear market. It may take a while to recover. My post history shows I was optimistic about BTC finding support at $12k, but I was wrong. But the one thing I DO still believe even now is we're going to have to wait possibly until Feb, maybe even until end of March before things improve. If we go off last year, we should be seeing some better days roughly around April/May.

I actually use your approach. It's kind of like DCA, but not quite I guess? I refuse to buy with the percentage of my portfolio that's in fiat when Bitcoin is bullish.

Look man, you've gotta disconnect yourself emotionally from your coins. The market owes you nothing. People who can buy at $8k or less aren't less deserving. There were youtubers warning that the super fast rally couldn't go on forever. One of my favorite youtubers caught a lot of shit for saying things could crash. I thought it might go on longer too, but I took the advice of people around me and phased out between 17k an 19k before it crashed. End of the day--you've gotta just learn from this and use this experience to mitigate risk in the future. When you see r/bitcoin spamming memes about lambos and how Bitcoin could easily reach $1,000,000 next week, *that's when you know it's time to sell.*  
Remember all those posts back in Nov/Dec where you had people stating they felt we were at the top? Those posts where people starting at about 15k and through the 20k price point said they were cashing out? People in this sub shat on them. But guess what? *They were right all along.*  
End of the day, we can all learn from the market's moons and crashes.

Patience. Bitcoin is rising over the past 3 days faster than many of your typical S&amp;P stocks moves in 3 months. It's not going to moon to 20k for a while. We need time to let both new and old investors gain more confidence in cryptos. If it gets there too fast, you should be worried about the weak, excited hands that jump on the fomowagon dumping it at the tiniest sign of uncertainty. We got excited when it hit 12k last night. It's just shy of 13k now. Let Papa BTC get past his hangover first.

For those on the fence--that's the power of a competent developer team. That's the difference between a coin with a long-term future and one that's just a pump and dump.

I'm not sure that I understand your question. Perhaps you assume that I'm arguing that Bitcoin needs to have a million+ features to keep up with the competition. Or that you think I'm arguing that Core devs just need to scrap the project entirely. Neither argument is contained in my prior posts.  
Core devs' inability to keep up with current challenges as many have outlined is the problem of the moment. As we see more and more companies refusing to adopt Bitcoin for payments, it's going to be contribute to BTC's dominance dropping to below 30% within the next couple of months. It won't kill BTC right away, but it will only further serve to sow doubts within the community. We're already seeing Bcash-me-out shills discovering that their beloved shitcoin got outpaced by a so-called similarly centralized "banker's coin." I doubt XRP will ever replace BTC as it's an apples to oranges comparison, but all it's going to take is just one alternative out of the hundreds out there to do at least 90% of what Bitcoin does better and the cards will fall.


I'd agree with this rather *broad* analogy if Bitcoin's blockchain network was the one that everything was being transacted upon. But that analogy if anything weakens your argument and actually creates an argument for Ethereum eventually flipping the tables and stealing the crown since any many other coins in the top 100 are ERC20 tokens. In fact, thanks for validating my large position in Ethereum!   
Sadly, Bitcoin has no such appeal at the moment except its early adopter and brand name status. Even Britney Spears peaked early and had to eventually call it quits

@_date: 2018-01-01 21:38:25


Do you really think updates are *that* quick to roll out in the world of software? The point I am trying to here is that it really isn't. Never mind Segwit requiring little more than a handful of developers to incorporate, its adoption rate is snail slow right now. If something so simple is already problematic, don't you think that fundamental  changes which take years of development and testing will have even more problems ramping up? Lightning Network has been years in the making and will will take many more years to fully ramp up if it even does at all. If some other coin offers a better way of handling transactions cheaply and quickly, it will overtake Bitcoin without any issues.  
Early mover advantage? Maybe if people actually were using Bitcoin. Most aren't. Most are just HODL'ing on the hopes of getting a new lambo or on the prayer that the loan they took out to buy it doesn't go upside down due to BTC not mooning fast enough. People in such positions don't need much convincing to get them to migrate over to other coins as they are now. Look at the declining % figure on coinmarketcap.  
I applaud Core devs for bringing Bitcoin this far, but I would worry about Bitcoin quickly becoming the IBM of the 80s. Slow to adapt to changing times and overtaken by its rivals.
@_date: 2018-01-30 20:35:02

I hang around with programmers all the time, so I am still willing to give some credence to those arguing that Bitcoin just needs more time to ramp up and address scaling. But how much longer? When we alpha/beta test videogames and operating systems, we do so understanding the product in question has to release sometime in the foreseeable near future or risk having its funding pulled by the studio's owners. That's the risk I see with Bitcoin. Its proverbial "owners," its HODL'ers, are going to panic once they see that it's not the future means of transacting via cryptocurrency outside of fiat.  
This is why many of us at r/cryptocurrency (great sub btw, recommend it) and elsewhere are hedging our bets. I would argue most of us see altcoins taking off in their own niches and are staking our bets on them. But the biggest pessimists declare that they see the writing on the wall and have significantly reduced their positions in Bitcoin.  
I still have a sizeable position in Bitcoin. But it's nowhere close to where it was when I started months ago. I hope that I am wrong in my assessments and I'll be joyful if I am as I still believe that we all need Bitcoin to succeed in the short to medium term in order for cryptos as a whole to gain mass adoption quicker.

Yep. If this were Kanye West, I'd agree. But the likes of Kanye are more often shilling low market cap shitcoins that could see their value lifted by public endorsements. But this is Bitcoin. *Bitcoin doesn't need shilling.* Everyone and their mom and dog knows what it is.

I use Bittrex and Binance for my alts. Do keep in mind neither allow fiat (USD, EUR, etc) to altcoin purchases, so you'll need to transfer Bitcoin, Ethereum, or some other coin over to buy Monero.  
I'm told Bitcoin transfer fees are down, but I'd still compare the fees before deciding whether to transfer Bitcoin or Ethereum to an altcoin exchange.  
I have all my XMR at Bittrex, but I'm strongly considering transferring it all to a desktop wallet. r/Monero has some good resources at the right on wallets. I'd personally avoid using the newly listed iOS one until it's been open sourced and audited thoroughly.

And those same cryptos don't have even 1/10th of Bitcoin's traffic at such low fees. Once LN comes fully online, those shitcoins will be competing not only against on-chain transactions supported by large networks of miners worldwide, but Lightning Network channels.  
Come to think of it...I'm only 20% in Bitcoin and 80% in alts. But once this comes fully online, I may have come back home. Papa BTC ain't gonna be nice to shitcoin hodl'ers.

They only said we'd be able to withdraw. But more details months before emerged showing changes to the API along with their mention that they'd be adding other coins next year that fueled speculation that BCH would be added. *Next year.* Not 2017. So for BCH to pump *precisely on the same day as and hours before BCH's release on Coinbase* makes this far too convenient of a coincidence.

All that's needed is for Bcash to adopt LN. But to do that, they'd have to adopt Segwit. Hoo boy.
@_date: 2017-12-29 16:50:58


Completely missing the underlying arguments that were against Segwit2x.  


Why would I be angry? I earned quite a bit off dumping BCH a while back and have been making it rain with the new kid on the block who's stolen BCH's bronze ranking.   
Honestly? I'm actually quite amused and unsurprised. BCH never had a future. People wayyyyy back were predicting BCH without proper developer support (no, no, copy/pasting code doesn't make one a good developer) would meet its demise. And with the new kid on the block gaining widespread adoption and filling in BCH's spot, that ain't changing!   


I don't think you understand the problem, just like you didn't understand the issues with Segwit2x.  
I'll give you 15 minutes to research Jihan's issue with LN. It's not LN itself *per se* that's the problem to him and his flunkie miner cabal. I'd understand why you're hilariously uninformed, but I've noticed that's *very* typical of the BCH cult.

Did you even take the time to watch the video? It doesn't address the issue with blocksizes at all. It more so addresses fabrication scaling vis-a-vis Moore's law and energy costs. Not so much block sizes. That's an issue we see becoming a huge problem later down the road as others above have illustrated.  
And most of all, Andreas wasn't talking about Bitcoin Cash.  
Nice try, but the information deficit between what I see as a polarized debate largely favors the Core crowd.

...then you're missing out on some easy scalp profits. This happens on a nearly weekly basis. I buy up BCH each time it hits rock bottom and dump it moons. Even bought more as it was mooning at .2 BTC and sold for .3 BTC before it peaked at 0.35 BTC. Rinse and repeat.  
You really shouldn't be concerned about BTC dying. It won't. Many others by now will have outlined why it'll do just fine. What all of us *should* be concerned with is the allegations of insider trading. Coinbase really didn't do itself favors here and their Twitter damage control won't do squat.

It may be a long wait, but the temptation of easy money will be too much for the new people. Even now, people all around me are asking about Bitcoin. Christmas just ended and many people went home after hours of discussing how to buy Bitcoin and now even Ripple over dinner. Friend of mine who's living abroad in a low energy cost area who was skeptical about Bitcoin for the longest time is now thinking about dropping cash on a mining operation. When monthly utility bills are pennies on the dollar compared to what we pay in the states, why not!

The central banks in other countries more or less operate in similar ways. Appointed--i.e. unelected--officials sit on their boards and make decisions on interest rates. This is what bothers many of us. There's just too much secrecy surrounding the Federal Reserve in America. That itself raises further questions. Whose interests does the Fed serve? The banks who seem to have way too much goddamn influence over them? Or the people? Who do the members of the board answer to? We know who appoints the head, but how do we hold the members accountable for their decisions?  
Efforts to audit it get [shot down]( because, well, I'm sure you can guess why. Now I'm no libertarian. I just think that any organization acting under the color of authority of the federal government should be subject to the same system of checks and balances as any other.

No one's turning this into an all or nothing proposition. But let's be real. If BCash's developers are too incompetent to come up with new features and fix their own problems without cribbing off Core AND accusing Core devs of being lackeys for space lizards, then that's **hypocrisy**. And this isn't the first time this has happened.   
And you wanna know the best thing? There's a nice little rumor floating around that Jihan wants to incorporate Lightning Network. Now *that* would be the ultimate hypocrisy.

A one world government with a single cryptocurrency that's accepted worldwide is *probably* how the fundies are spinning things. From a political science perspective, they're probably not wrong that that's where we're headed.

Now whether that's actually what we in the bitcoin community actually want is a completely different question. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:29:41
That's the interesting part. *Most* people weren't opposed to the block size that came with Segwit2X. It was the slew of other issues such as no replay protection that repelled most of the community. I'm not sure that doubling the block size would hasten whatever centralization issues anti-big blockers fear as long as we keep it at 2mb and use LN to really move a good chunk of transactions off the chain.  
At any rate, I sure hope LN is ready sooner than later!

Our memories are short. 'member the so-called "flippening?" People were panicking left and right. Quite a few Youtubers had to step in and reassure everyone that things were going to be alright. This is nothing. Coinbase pulled a few dirty moves and we saw MSNBC shilling BCH. BFD. The effect on BTC has been minimal compared to the joke we call the November flippening. It's another day.  
Not to say we should do nothing. If anything, we all have work to do in educating the masses getting into cryptos. I am personally working on getting a few friends in on this. The very first thing I will do is explain to them both sides of the story and let them choose. But I won't be too shy to disclose the histories of the kind of people behind BCH. My bud who works in engineering and has done some programming in the past is fully aware of the distinctions between BTC and BCH and already has a pretty good idea of which one he will be making bigger bets on.

Thankfully, 90% of those are the products of ICO scams. But unfortunately, many of them are still very much alive even in this bear market. That tells me Bitcoin may have to drop to as low as $3,000 before things normalize and we see actual adoption.   
But all is not doom and gloom. I think Brian Armstrong may be right if it's the case we're soon going to see 1 billion people in the Bitcoin space by 2020. Between now and then, Bitcoin may at worst retain its usual value of $5-7k and grow from there as people slowly dump all other coins for it and newcomers join the space.

I mean seriously, technology and religion don't mix. So anytime you hear someone bleating that one coin is in line with some mortal human being's vision, you should start asking more questions and do some more research.

More or less. With how much trouble it's having consistently staying above $14k, I'm actually ready to sell some Bitcoin off in the event we get the temporary spike at about $17k.  
And This market is full of people who just have no confidence in Bitcoin. I don't expect everyone to be able to read Satoshi's whitepaper and summarize it down to the tiny details. But you know we have "normies" panic selling and refusing to re-enter the market, all because they refuse to shut out the FUD. Meanwhile, the rest of us who got in well below $10k aren't worried. Just a bit annoyed.  
TA isn't magic. It's not 100% accurate. It's all about probabilities. Those call groups that charge money use TA to more or less guarantee they'll turn a profit at least over 50% of the time. It's like mastering the probabilities inherent within poker to win at Vegas. You learn the rules and manipulate them so the house *doesn't* always win.

Just because something hasn't happened before doesn't mean it'll *never* happen. When people anticipate shorting Bitcoin, they're working off economic theory and centuries of history. I'm going to guess you're either (1) too insulated from other bubbles we had in the past 30 years or (2) too young to have been around to experience them. Either way, I think many young Bitcoin holders are going get their first brush with just how harsh bubbles can be.   
I'd like it if Bitcoin's price were to behave like gold's, not crash at all but plateau over time. But here's the thing. Bitcoin doesn't have the universal acceptance worldwide among both regular joes and national governments like gold does. That's what would concern me.

Let's be honest. 98%+ of Bitcoin HODLers are in it to make some extra money. We're years away from mass adoption. YES, transfer times are high and YES fees are atrocious. But that's not going to be a problem until I start being able to buy my sandwiches and coffees at local coffeeshops.  
Once Segwit gets wider adoption and LN comes online, I'm confident this will be resolved.

That's what has been worrying me. Friends and I had plans to liquidate our principal and leave our profits' worth of bitcoin and alts in our wallets and exchanges in anticipation of them trying cute tricks. Looks like they decided to start today!!
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:47:27


I am all too aware of that. That's why I cashed out the value of my principal right around the time it hit ATH of $20k. In the absolute worst case scenario, I lose nothing. In a less pessimistic scenario, I still have quite a bit in profits I can choose to cash out or sit on in coins.   
The one major risk I can see bringing down the entire crypto ecosystem a-la Mt. Gox are Bitfinex in tandem with Tether collapsing after what some say will be an exit scam. But I don't see that happening for a *bit* longer. It's true more Tethers are bring printed on a nearly daily basis, hence why I'm considering cashing out some of my profits very soon and weathering whatever storm arrives.

Let's just say both are showing signs of being on paths to becoming maladjusted members of society. When the trading bots start making life harder for amateur day traders, I truly do wonder where they'll be. No higher education degree, no trades/crafts experience, no soft skills. What then? Where do you go when you have 5 figures of bitcoin profits and no other direct path to a consistent income source that doesn't involve years of hard work and education?

@_date: 2017-12-31 10:18:09
Yep. Decentralized exchanges are probably going to need a ton of trial and error before we get them down pat. But once they're ready for primetime, they're going to be more or less a refinement of smart contracts. No need for centralized middlemen when we use tech and concepts already in place to get the job done far cheaper and more efficiently.  
All you BCH trolls--get your head out of your asses and start researching. Your coin doesn't have a future. Bitcoin Gold already got kicked out of the top 5 in less than a month. Bitcoin Cash is next. You already have a coin in XRP that can do everything BCH can do and better. Yes, banks will inevitably adopt different tokens while utilizing the same protocol. But they're not adopting Cash. The anarcho types weren't completely wrong when they said centralized tokens will be worthless. There's a grain of truth in that.

I seem to recall that it *did* fall to 10.5k at some point. I even picked up some at 12.5k. Those TA people have been wrong in many cases, but in this case, I had a hunch they were onto something once it fell below $14k. Seems like it's found support at roughly somewhere around $14k.

You're hardly alone. I stopped dollar cost averaging once my last limit order was filled this morning. I'm happy with the BTC I acquired at about $13 (wouldn't be surprised if some of it was from the idiots here who panic sold), but let's be cautious and real. The rise from $10k to $20k was a bit too damn fast. Many of us were skeptical that it was truly over when it looked like it was already recovering yesterday. A bear that lasts several more days isn't out of question at this point.  
The best course of action? Be ready to celebrate if $14k truly is support. But if it starts creeping below $10k, expect mass panic and prep a few buy orders.

BTC's value dropped by quite a bit before before recovering to where it is now as of this writing.  
So an economic recession would create millions of panicky people looking to liquidate their investments just so they can pay rent and not have to live at a shelter. There were already a lot of people during the last recession who liquidated their 401k's. Imagine how negatively the herd mentality will impact BTC's value as many sell off.

That's the problem with living in the glorified larger collective that is countries such as America. Taxation's a must for ensuring larger pooled projects like highways and high-speed internet (and I'm referring to internet access to much more than e-mails to your neighbor) actually get funded on a larger scale. During the recession, you had anarchist types and libertarians talking about how we can just rely on businesses to build those roads and highways for us. Yeah...just [one problem.]( We just barely manage to rack up enough in taxes to pay for such things. How can we expect businesses to pay even a few pennies if we abolish government completely?  
Don't get me wrong. I have my objections to many aspects of how the feds run things. Anyone can point to problems with government corruption and inefficiencies. But I'm a realist as well. If anything, I would hope Bitcoin forces central governments do clean up their act and offer something better than they offer now.

The simile may be more relevant than you think. Bitcoin is the starting coin for those of us getting into crypto coins for the first time. As we learn about the mechanics of blockchain networks and the possibilities other coins offer, we mature in our understanding that we as users benefit from the growth of altcoins.

Tote it as superior to BTC and use your clout with a Chinese mining cartel to pump and dump it.

Nah, I just see it as a wakeup call. I've made similar comments in this sub in the past. People need to calm down and keep their eyes on the bigger picture. Volatility is how people make money in Bitcoin. The sooner people accept this is how things are going to be, the easier it'll be to ride things through the wild times.

I'm sure it'll come back down. If you still doubt that, do a bit of dollar cost averaging and start buying in increments along the way down.  
I'm personally going to try to avoid checking prices more than once every couple hours instead of every other minute. I should be able to catch at least one more dip that way.
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:10:44
Considering it just barely touched $500 not too long ago? I'd say sure. Keep in mind it's a bear market, so it **could** drop even lower than that. I hear the last bear market HODLers were in lasted 3 weeks, so we might be waiting a while. I locked in some ETH at $440 and decided against buying anymore. Might wait until I get home from work later before pulling the trigger.

I like Coinbase/Gdax. I made my first profits through them. But let's be honest. They're not prepared to handle the influx of new customers. My advice is to diversify where you hold your coins. Doesn't hurt to leave small amounts for day trading on other exchanges. I sometimes buy from Gemini since the $500 you deposit is instantly accessible for buying BTC. I'd also consider transferring any long-term HODL BTC/ETH/LTC/etc to a wallet. That's what I'm doing tonight.

True. I think what's also implicit in this message is that further forks of bitcoin just aren't going to be taken very seriously until it actually happens *and* happens to garner widespread support adoption. The cherry on top in my mind is that some people at Binance are all too aware of the nonzero possibility that 2x was just a ploy to pump n' dump bxcash before it dies into irrelevance.

Let's see if it holds that way for long. The inverse relationship between BTC and Cash show us that people are jumping between the two. Plus we didn't walk into Segwit2x expecting a walk in the park. Cash simply replaced 2x in the fight for supremacy. Roger Ver and co to exploit the swings for their own gain for just a bit longer. Maybe 3-4 days minimum? At any rate--we all know the drill by now. HODL and buy low and jump into any undervalued alts.

Seriously. I don't think there are too many in this thread alone who're old enough to *really* appreciate the rise and relative decline of prior era giants like IBM to have enough perspective. BTC will most likely in the future be remembered as a great precursor currency that fueled the boom of the Googles, Apples, Microsofts, and Amazons of the future. Sure, features such as Lightning Network will kick off widespread adoption of high speed, low fee transactions. But that's the just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to what other ICOs are exploring.  
I'm still going to keep my share of Bitcoin in the double digit % figures. But as it slows down, I'm probably going to keep it as a hedge and a means of acquiring other alt coins and really explore other coins with greater growth potential. Bitcoin was the star of the show. But as with pop culture, you're going to inevitably have other bands that set new trends and grab the crown.

What do you think payroll does? Give banks only partial control of your cash? It was inevitable banks were going to begin offering wallet services. If the banks insure it, it'll be safer than leaving your money at exchanges. And if any of it gets stolen, that's grounds for an easy lawsuit thanks to the ledger alone making the coins traceable.

That's pretty typical. Think of your typical banking/finance guy as that senior federal government official who's staunchly anti-1st and 4th Amendment rights, really pro-establishment. A lot of federal government dudes you run into will often have this view that you can *always* trust the government. Accountability? Audits? *We don't need none o' that!* We're the government!
The banker spends years of his life in college and later in the industry believing that the lens through which he reads the economy is the only correct one. Anything that contradicts the narrative he's internalized is wrong. And Bitcoin challenges many of his basic assumptions, often times even *undermines* them. So of course your coworker is going to shit on Bitcoin.

Another dip below the $6k price point or even lower is an opportunity for both regular joes like us and then big money institutions looking to jump in on the action. It's holding pretty stubbornly at $6k atm, but this PND might still have some legs on it. A drop in price for HODLers would just mean they'd have to be patient or even better, consider buying more.

I don't expect it to be an all-or-nothing proposition. Bitcoin is the most well known one that people learn about first before migrating to alts. But a good chunk still buy and hodl Bitcoin in the process. Really, this isn't a sports team.

With all the developments and other good news I'm seeing in the crypto space these past 2 years and now this recent price action, I'm definitely looking into buying more Bitcoin if it gets rejected at the $6k resistance levels. I figured the bear market would last longer, but now that I think about it, us hodlers who've been around years weren't going to be shaken out that easily. All the talk of Bitcoin going to $1k or below was a bit exaggerated. To all my fellow hodlers who held the line and kept the price up all this time, kudos.
@_date: 2019-04-11 21:10:39
Can't let yourself get too upset over this. Price swings are how many make money. If anything, I think it'd be better if there were a bigger pullback attracting us crypto veterans into buying up more. Way better if the veterans buy and hold rather than if nubs with 1 week old accounts jump on and get scared into dumping due to double digit price swings.

Here's to hoping this is the double bottom some people were calling. Sold a long position at $8.2k last night and came back this evening seeing things dipping into the mid $7k to no surprise.

Carter Thomas was spot on today. The people who moved the price from $6k to $11k were likely those who've been in the crypto space a while and not newbs. There just isn't a lot of excitement materializing into new sign-ups on Coinbase that we saw back in December. Even Youtube activity is slowing down among the crypto Youtubers.  
The solution? We've gotta get right back to talking about cryptos with our family, friends. I personally have no more holidays where I'll be meeting with family and relatives for at least 2 months, so I can see this being tricky to pull off for many in America alone.

Not saying I know for sure this is the turnaround, but if it is, let's remember the lessons we all took from this bear. Think about how you felt when the price rose in December and when it tanked after and let's take that as a reminder not to allow our emotions to drive bad decisions.

Some people just want to acquire more Bitcoin at a discount. The whales most likely do if we're to believe there's been manipulation going on. I personally have a low target price at which I'm willing to pick up more as well. Others feel that bottoming out at $5k now instead of later would position us for the next bull run sooner.  
I'm not a fan of bear markets, but it is what it is. The market doesn't care for whatever emotional attachments we have to our coins. It just does what it does and transfers wealth from one set of hands to another and rewards those who understand fundamentals and TA better. If you believe in the tech and believe we will go parabolic this year, Bitcoin crashing back to $5k shouldn't stress you out. This is truly one of those cases were hodl'ing tests your patience.

I guess this kind of straddles the border and all, but a more ideal way to go about it would've been linking to one of several discussions taking place on Twitter regarding this issue. Nonetheless, this thread does entertain discussion of this issue, particularly for newbies who use the wallet.
But I think it's important we move on from the old spat with the rbtc community. I'm *not* saying everyone has to bury the hatchet so to speak. But as this subreddit continues to grow due to new people entering the space, we'd be best served being welcoming and placing ourselves above the fray, myself included. The war with rbtc is so 2017. Let's just put that behind us, learn from the lessons, and focus on Bitcoin's growth and adoption. We can from time to time combat whatever misinformation campaign comes our way should the need arise. But we've got to look to the future.

You sure? People are saying there's a strong chance of a turnaround in the coming days. I'll happily buy 2 Bitcoin for the price of 1, but goddamn I'm worried it won't hit $5k. $5k was what I decided to stash aside when I saw how things were going.

A few comments on a subreddit? Really? Let's not go full r/conspiracy now. Tis a silly place already. And fwiw, people on r/bitcoin are just a drop in the barrel. Whales don't need to spread FUD to tank Bitcoin. If it's not Spoofy, it's some institutional whale pumping Bitcoin up and tempting people into FOMO'ing before it dumps again.  
As for those forecasting another dump--some people have just been forecasting a possible double bottom. For all we know, it could indeed crash back down. We've had *several* pumps across the board that preceded massive dumps. That's just the way the cookie crumbles.    
I don't think it's wise to get too emotional about the price. This is a bear market pure and simple. As much as we'd all hope for Bitcoin's rise, it's still very much possible it could fall. It's that simple. Don't call them assholes, just be mindful that shit happens in cryptos. Enjoy the volatility during the good times and accept the bears as well.

Song doesn't argue that Bitcoin dominance is "useless" in that article (very easy read btw, I encourage others to check it out!). Most of his sub-points seem to be arguing that we can't use it to bolster this misguided notion that Bitcoin is "useless" and that it's "dying" due to people migrating to other coins. At worst, I do agree with him that it can be crude to the point of misleading if we read into it too much. But it has its use.
Like it or not, people still pay attention to it. It's prominently visible on coinmarketcap.com. YES, it's true that it's natural that Bitcoin couldn't hold its 50%+ dominance forever due to soooo many other coins entering the market. YES, it's true that market cap itself tends to be misleading (see Song's XRP example). But at the end of the day, for technical analysis purposes, many including yours truly *still pay attention to it.* It's not the end-all, be-all factor. But just like the current temperature and humidity, I pay attention to it when I want to get an idea of how the weather's going to be today.  
P.S. The dominance % is on the rise. I'd pay attention to other figures such as overall increases in volume both for Bitcoin and the crypto market as a whole of course. But if that dominance % hits 40% and starts creeping up to 50%, expect altcoins to get absolutely smashed.

When I say "use cases," I'm referring to a situation where more than 1% of total transactions are for anything other than day trading and speculating because that's where we are right now. The use cases are too limited. When we start using cryptos regularly to buy coffee and conduct business via smart contracts, then the risk of things going down the shitter will vanish.

For veteran crypto owners, it's good news that generates hype. This update alone serves as a reminder that contrary to what many would have you believe, Bitcoin isn't dead. And with all these developments we keep seeing, it's far from being Myspace.  
For new users, you're partially right. They won't know what to make of it. But major updates like Segwit lower transaction fees and transfer times.

Same value of transactions based on...right. Speculation and day trading! Bruh, that ain't adoption!  
Any asset whose transaction volume is based mainly in glorified gambling is going to fluctuate up and down and one day burst when enough people have decided they've earned enough in profits and see no reason to continue holding onto Bitcoin due to fiat being seen as more practical. The only thing to stop that from happening is for more and more people and entities to actually use Bitcoin and not convert it into fiat as often as they do today. Hodl'ing only temporarily stabilizes things as the goal for many of us is to eventually take out profits in fiat.   
But I'm still a bit cautiously optimistic. If the UX side of things leads to desktop and mobile apps allowing us to send Bitcoin cheaply via LN and as more businesses quickly come to regard Bitcoin as a true store of value that should only occasionally be converted into fiat instead of all the time, Bitcoin might just go the way of gold. It's a bubble that won't pop. It may tank a bit from new ATHs, but it'll stabilize and be regarded worldwide as a universally accepted currency. That's my hope.

I could see new regs slowing down ICOs. Typically with such regulations, you have similar filing requirements to what businesses have to put up with.  The developers and the managers administrating the entire operation have to be named. Have to list the headquarters of the operation. Have to describe with some level of particularity WHAT it is your coin is purporting to do so the coin buyers know what they're buying into.  
Only in this case, because most individual cryptos aren't functioning as corporations that have to deal with sales and shareholders, it won't be a 1:1 copy/paste of rules and regs.

I'm keeping an open mind for now. I don't think Robinhood's opened up crypto trades just yet. I'm not going to put too much of a premium in who supported S2x as I'm a practical guy end of the day. But as BTC adoption picks up, we really need exchanges to pick up Segwit pronto.

Of course no one can say, but the general sentiment seems to be that $6k is the bottom. I was actually hoping it'd hit $5k, but my limit order never triggered. Settled for $6k before going to bed and woke up to Bitcoin being just shy of $7k.

Have to remember the cryptosphere is full of many young people who're impatient and haven't been alive enough to have witnessed the growth of many technologies they take for granted today. We were dealing with higher than normal fees and long transaction times for a few months and yet, you still had a lot of young whippersnappers acting like it would remain this way forever. "I want my low fees now, I want a coin that's fully working and polished with no issues whatsoever yesterday!" seems to be the typical mindset.  
Folks, that's not how this works. An undertaking as large as Bitcoin takes time to develop. Let it grow. A little patience goes a long way in other areas than just hodl'ing.

That being said, I'm not pouring anymore new fiat into Bitcoin until we get the next rejection. I'm not sure whether we'll pass prior ATHs. We have many who bought at the top and didn't sell, so we may see a dump-off before the next run-up.

It'd be a bad deal for a buyer to try to throw $ at Gdax only to discover that even a $10,000 purchase is causing the price to skyrocket. Ever try buying up a lot of a low cap coin on Binance and gotten really mad at how people started freaking out and raising the price? That's not a situation buyers wants.  
OTC purchases mean the price is way more predictable. And the rumors I'm hearing is that anyone who isn't like JP Morgan or Morgan Stanley in having bought back in 2017 when Bitcoin was where it is now is buying it up via OTC sales.

Feeling more optimistic than I was a week ago for sure. Still feeling slightly cautious as I feel we need Bitcoin to pump into the 5 digits and find support there for the general public to be brought back in. Still have some skeptic friends who believe this is a dead cat bounce and that the general public is going to have been too traumatized by the post-$20k crash to be lured back in, but I think many of them are still ripe for some good old-fashioned Satoshi Christ evangelism.

One of them in particular who said this to me the other day has been in the finance industry for years and has made a killing off stocks. Guy's probably retiring at 50-55 latest at the rate things are going. He's also the same one who advised me to sell off my Bitcoin right as it was at $17.5k. Saved me a major heartbreak there for sure. Really intelligent guy. And I do agree there is *some* merit to his thought process.  
Back in Oct/Nov and after, we were coming off the China FUD and noticing many among the general public setting up new Coinbase accounts at record setting rates and buying up cryptos. Right now, it's more or less clear that many of those FOMO kiddies who pumped it to $20k aren't coming back. At least not for a while. For cryptos to go parabolic again, we need more new money and not just the institutional investor money pumps we're witnessing.  
So I'm a cautious optimist myself for now. Enjoying the pumps, but hopeful we can get the general public excited for cryptos again.
@_date: 2018-04-12 16:51:12

I don't see all price pumps and dumps as products of manipulation. If that's what you think I'm arguing, I'm not. But for a $1,000 pump in under an hour as shorts are at their peak? There's a juicy opportunity for a whale to go long on Bitfinex through wash trading. 
@_date: 2018-04-12 19:04:56
I can understand wanting it to succeed, but most successful investors are going to be those who accept the bulls *and* the bears for what they are and not view any bets on Bitcoin bearish as rooting for the bad guys. There's no team. The real enemy of Bitcoin really is the threat of irrelevance. If Bitcoin can gain mass adoption, we'll certainly all be riding the gravey train.   
That being said, things are looking better for Bitcoin and the crypto markets as a whole. I'm just not ready to make any trades based on any assumption that this is the turnaround. I may buy back on the next pullback, but we'll see.
@_date: 2018-04-09 15:03:38

Think of it like horse race betting. If you want to win anything by betting on one horse, someone has to bet against you or in this analogy, another horse. Your win is someone else's loss and vice versa. Just as it's illegal to rig and throw games, it's illegal to wash trade (albeit tough to detect and catch) which is what some of us believe is happening. My friend's gears get grinded when I compare margin trading to gambling, but it's as close as you'll get in the crypto world!  
There's suspicion that one or more whales saw short positions at recent highs and saw the opportunity to go long instead on Bitfinex and essentially wipe out the shorters, i.e. take their money.

It's not a mere conspiracy theory if the opportunity and motive are there for wash trades to fuel longs.  
Look. I'm hopeful for Bitcoin's success as much as anyone. But the timing of the sudden spike to coincide with shorts at recent highs was just way too coincidental. If you think this is part of a trend toward sustained growth we'll see all of this week and next, feel free to buy in.

$7k seems to be many people's re-entry point. My fiat deposit just came through, so I'm waiting to add to my position at that level. Worst comes to worst, if Bitcoin takes off yet again and dominance rises to the point of shredding alts for the 2nd time, I'll scoop those alts up instead.

Yeah. Even better, the avenues for buying Bitcoin have only increased. Back then, we didn't have instant purchases on Coinbase or apps like Cash app.  
One thing's for sure. If buying BTC in 2017 was like driving through a busy freeway during rush hour, 1.5 years later, we now have bullet trains and underground munis making it even quicker and easier. All these extra avenues are paving the way for the next bull run.

I'm inclined to say up is the direction it's leaning toward. Another person far smarter than I put it aptly: the dump to $7k allowed those who had been unwilling to buy at $8k after seeing it stay around $3k for so long to buy up. It brought more hodlers in.  
Me personally, I'd been hoping to pick some BTC and XRP at discounted levels and I came away satisfied. Now that I'm nearly out of excess DCA fiat, it's time for me to HODL and resist the temptation to day trade.

Nice on the heads-up. History truly does repeat itself. Mt Gox provided us with a valuable lesson on why it's important to keep as much of your coins in cold storage wallets.
@_date: 2019-05-17 03:10:58
This is the dip I was waiting for. Fiat's ready to go soon as we confirm support at $7k levels. Get ready, boys and girls. This is the stuff of legends.
@_date: 2019-05-22 22:58:50


Tis a simple question. Why are you hoping the guy you're replying to misses out?
@_date: 2019-05-22 22:22:37
I'm waiting for it to drop a bit lower. $7.7k isn't a discount in my mind.
@_date: 2019-05-20 14:22:04
If randomass people are finding out about Bitcoin, that's usually a good sign. It's getting people talking about it, making new account on Coinbase, and pumping the markets.
@_date: 2019-05-22 23:38:15
I'm somewhat of a hodler myself, got 75% of my portfolio in cold storage for the long term. But c'mon, dips and rises are the stuff of cryptos. Gotta take the good with the bad and not give a shit if someone sells. That's their business.
@_date: 2019-05-22 22:22:21


Why's that? Is he a bad person for selling before it dropped to $7.7k just now? What kind of cult is this sub turning into?
@_date: 2019-05-17 17:46:21
Did you read the 2nd half?  
It's not so much a "conspiracy" that the guy you're replying to is concerned with for conversation purposes. The fact that it still happens on an individual basis which undermines gold's ability to be a trustless standard.
@_date: 2019-05-03 19:08:13
I'm sure a block size increase will come some day. But only after we've exhausted all other avenues for improvement.
@_date: 2019-05-12 06:43:46
I bought some on the way up. But I'm pretty confident there's going to be a small dump down to the $6-7k levels before the next run-up to 10k. Have some fiat ready for the retracement price.
@_date: 2019-05-12 06:36:01
I'm sure there's some manipulation going on. No one likes it. But it is what it is. Just like last time, we just have to make sure we don't get *too* greedy and be ready to take profits along the way up.
@_date: 2019-05-08 17:37:36
Absolute power tends to corrupt absolutely, so it may be getting to his head. Not a huge fan of IEOs either.  
I've used Binance extensively for alts, but I think this may be a sign it's time to more closely consider the alternatives and keep all our coins off exchanges as much as possible. The hacking and now the god complex quote does have me eyeing picking up a Ledger X more than ever.
@_date: 2019-05-12 05:22:59
One hell of a runup going on.
@_date: 2019-05-12 23:05:05
You weren't completely wrong. Topped out at about $7.4k before pulling down to $6.9k levels. Debating adding to my stacks or waiting for another pullback.
@_date: 2019-05-14 03:50:55
Hard to say. Lot of seasoned TA guys have been surprised.
@_date: 2019-05-17 17:17:54


He may be referring to [this.]( Hard to detect.
@_date: 2019-05-22 23:37:27
I do think so too, but not this soon imo. Multiple TA peeps are anticipating a run-up into the 10-12k zone before a massive dip a-la 40%.
@_date: 2019-05-17 18:36:39
No one really knows. There's some concern that the bounceback from $6,400 wasn't as strong as hoped. Nick from Datadash thinks it could go as low as $5k. And if further legal action against Bitfinex/Tether causes Tether to be frozen, say good-bye to a major source of liquidity in the crypto markets.  
I wouldn't blame anyone for exiting the market at this point and waiting for support at lower levels.  
EDIT: Imma stick around a bit longer. Learned the hard way last bull run that it's best to park bits of your fiat at a time and DCA in at a regular pace during dips and rises.
@_date: 2019-05-22 23:43:04


That's just childish on your part. 


What that kind of attitude, I'd say I think you still do believe in the fat gift giver.
@_date: 2019-05-03 14:20:35
This recent price action sounds nice until you realize a chunk of it is Bitfinex customers paying a premium to GTFO.  
I sure hope Bitfinex doesn't become the bane of our portfolios. Please don't crash, Bitfinex.
@_date: 2019-05-17 18:01:25






The very comparison you're making between the difficulty in verifying the authenticity of gold bars and crypto scams themselves is shaky. It's *because* cryptos have value scams involving them happen. To suggest that scams provide merit to any claims cryptos are worthless is a bit circular.
@_date: 2019-05-17 23:21:50
DCA'ing my way in slowly. Not buying at this price level as I do feel we're 50/50 on a dump to $6k before the next climb. Still have a large position in BTC.
@_date: 2019-05-26 19:52:01
If this is really the end of the consolidation period, then upwards we go. See if we can break $8.4k this time around.
@_date: 2019-05-24 15:12:13
Pump it, boys and girls.
@_date: 2019-05-08 16:01:18
Curious about buying BTC via the Cash app. Any chance someone might be able to tell me how the fees compare to buying on say Coinbase or Gemini? I understand that the fees are priced into the buy price?
@_date: 2019-05-23 16:10:35
Any other time than during a consolidation which is what we're in right now. Lot of seasoned TA day traders are advising that the best thing to do unless you're absolutely confident you know what you're doing is nothing during this phase.
@_date: 2019-05-13 15:44:25
I could never really get day trading down pat. Gave it a shot, made a few here and there, but also made a few pricey mistakes. Wound up getting the bulk of my gains from just hodl'ing about 10 different coins in the top 20 by market cap.  
After I add to my BTC stack with one last large buy for this month, the plan for 2019-2020 is probably going to be to just DCA my way into BTC and maintain a certain % of each coin.
@_date: 2019-05-04 23:56:34
This submission like many others in this sub is a joke. Yes, we get it. Bitcoin is kickstarting a tech and financial revolution. But it's not causing a megabillionaire such as Warren to go apeshit.
@_date: 2019-05-08 16:53:28
Curious, what problems do you think they'll pose?  
Binance is one of the bigger exchanges around, so I could see an implosion causing panic. But same time, I don't see CZ pulling an exit scam. It seems way too profitable to maintain the status quo.
@_date: 2019-05-30 04:24:47
Heavily manipulated. Definitely a DYOR coin.
@_date: 2019-05-24 18:46:57
Same reason any company might finance operations through equity. One guy replied to you with acquisitions being one. It could also just be that this is the cheapest and easiest way at the moment for them to pick up cash for expanding capacity and operations ahead of a bull run.  
Most of us are probably sticking with our stocks in our IRAs and accumulating more crypto.
@_date: 2019-05-13 14:38:45
Safe to say that TA won't really be all that helpful at this stage. All that consolidation at $4-5k means a sharp pullback never was in the cards. Caught me by surprise for sure.
@_date: 2019-05-10 17:00:48
That's a pretty steep climb. Waiting on the sidelines with some fiat to buy more at the next pullback and support.  
If this trend keeps up, fall 2019 truly might be a redux of the last bull run, but even more explosive.
@_date: 2019-05-05 02:53:08


The other person aptly spelled one flaw (among many) in your assumption.  
But there's more. All these blockchain advances companies such as Walmart are adopting are only going to improve productivity. Blockchain is simply being coopted. It's not displacing the current system in place to the degree the more impassioned people in this sub are preaching. And furthermore, Bitcoin won't replace the US dollar for everyday transactions. Look at the way fees are already climbing. There's no way billions of people will be able to transact via Bitcoin without incurring fees that dwarf traditional wire transfer fees.  
This sub sometimes makes me wonder if its average member is 17.
@_date: 2019-05-03 23:44:22


Some people are reportedly getting banned by them for transferring BTC out. I'm not sure how much weight to attach to these stories though.
@_date: 2019-05-07 04:37:24
Definitely seeing a lot more volume throughout April. Moving averages are also looking great. Already bought some a few days ago, waiting to buy more once we can confirm support at $6k levels. Hope we can make it.
@_date: 2019-05-13 21:31:38
Give it more time. Google search analytics aren't showing a spike in searches for Bitcoin. Once the public catches on and starts buying up Bitcoin on exchanges, then it's party time.
@_date: 2019-05-04 00:04:15
The hell. I've only transferred 4 figures worth *max* at a time and I still got the increased limit.
@_date: 2019-05-13 16:33:58
C'mon, Bitcoin. Break that $8,000 resistance!
@_date: 2019-05-23 16:29:51
To be honest, I'm still quite new to TA. But these past couple of days, this kind of [choppy action]( really hasn't been the kind of environment I'd want to be scalping in.
@_date: 2019-05-23 00:12:02
No sense panicking. Unlike back in 2017, there's actual adoption taking place. We have entire countries full of people who're trying to escape inflation by moving into cryptos and blowing off their own currencies. Fidelity hasn't even opened up shop yet for Bitcoin. Long as you haven't invested more than you can afford to lose, the best we can do is crack jokes and memes and ride this one out, just like every other dip that comes. This is nothing compared to the 30-40% dips we saw on and off in 2017. Get used to it and just view the dips as buying opportunities.
@_date: 2019-05-13 23:14:52
Definitely will be doing.  
We can sit and chat about TA all the day, but when the public starts pumping FOMO volume, all that goes out the window
@_date: 2019-05-18 01:23:17
Hard to say if we're out of the woods, but it's certainly looking better. way better than seeing a lot of downward sell pressure in the order books that we saw last night. For those of you who held, kudos.
@_date: 2019-05-03 20:37:52


Where is this proof Bitfinex is completely solvent? Where is the audit by an accounting firm showing the Tethers are backed? Why are people pulling out of Bitfinex in droves? If anything, doesn't the "FUD" prove the exact opposite of what you're saying?   
You do realize checking account balances are FDIC-insured, yes?  
I sometimes wonder whether intro to accounting courses should be required in high school.
