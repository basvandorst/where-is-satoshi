Still, you only invested €250.

Thanks, but I'll take my chances.

When I was a teenager, just a few years ago, I was buying Bitcoin through a local ATM. The fee was about 10%, but the process was extremely simple and only required me to have a phone. If you don't have anyone that can buy Bitcoin for you with a credit card/bank account, my suggestion is that you find the nearest Bitcoin ATM.

If it's their money, I would listen to them. Because if God forbid there is a big crash, they'll make sure you never forget about how you lost their money "investing in fake money". On the other hand, worst case scenario you lose $2,000, but by cashing out you could miss out on a very serious sum. Tough call, but like I said I'd sell. Perhaps just sell $2,000 worth, return it to them, and hodl (or not) the profit.

I shall consider his hodlings gone just like he is. Stealing from the deceased is still immoral.

I unfortunately sold my IOTA a while ago, so I don't need a place to hold it, but nonetheless I recommend the Exodus wallet. They don't support IOTA just yet, but I have a feeling they will soon.

If you buy $100 worth of BTC at $10,000 and its value declines to $9,000 you're left with $90. Your investment will always be relative to the value.

Buying under $100 worth of Bitcoin.

I don't use Coinbase since they closed my account for no reason over a year ago, so I'm not familiar with their website any more, but there has to be some way to contact them.

Your entire BTC portfolio doesn't have to (nor should it) sit on an exchange as you're liquidating it. You can just transfer a certain amount from your wallet to the exchange, sell it, transfer the FIAT to your bank account, and repeat.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:32:03
Always happy to help.

Find a reputable seller on local bitcoins that accepts your preferred form of payment (bank transfer for example).

I don't recommend holding your coins on any exchange. However I invested in IOTA a couple of months ago and I used Bitfinex as the exchange. I held it on there for a while because I didn't feel like getting a designated wallet and it wasn't a significant amount. After a 100% profit I turned it back into BTC and sent it back to my main wallet. Didn't have any problems, but please don't use exchanges as wallets.

I remember someone had a similar issue recently. Reach out to their support team - that's what solved their problem.
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:34:21
But how would you go about recovering them? I had a friend that died early this year when Bitcoin was at about $1,200 a coin. Him and I were really into it and I know he had a nice chunk of it sitting on his computer. I wouldn't be surprised if it was $50k by now. RIP him and RIP his coins.

Of course. Your addresses are always valid and you'll receive the funds regardless of whether the app is opened or not.

Bitcoin is great for buying drugs online, so more than you think.

When I didn't have a bank account yet I found the nearest Bitcoin ATM and paid cash. The fees can be pretty high though.
