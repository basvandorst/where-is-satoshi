I agree but wouldn’t federal crypto currency make more sense from the government’s perspective?

Yes retail investors can vote on certain issues, like board seats. And listen to earnings calls. And stocks can be traded commission free via Robinhood and similar apps.
Also let’s assume that the share price is determined by the present value of expected dividend payments. I can wait and collect as many dividend payments as I’d like and the price of the stock won’t change...... so that’s basically free money (and hopefully enough to keep you ahead of inflation)

Dividends for one. Easier for the average joe for another. Voting on corporate leadership etc.

Robinhood is for long term investing, just an example... 
For your last point, yea the price graph saw tooths by the dividend amount. But if the dividends remains a constant value payed out however often a year the stock price will remain the same on any ex dividend date into the future. 
Buying stock, options, or futures all have benefits and weaknesses and it’s up to the individual investor to determine what’s right for them... Comparing stock and bitcoin is what I disagree with, as the comparison doesn’t make too much sense. It’s most comparable to digital gold in its current form, but clearly is it’s own beast. It will be interesting to see how its derivative market plays out and how the price of bitcoin is affected by it

^ this.  
As an aside the daily volatility of bitcoin is going to make pricing options very though and likely expensive. Id imagine the first futures contracts will take a team of lawyers. But then again that’s what we pay them for
