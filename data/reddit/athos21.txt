Can you elaborate on what needs to be addressed before UASF activation?
@_date: 2017-03-24 13:58:31
I don't have to. The miners are creating an alt already. It's called BU.

It's not about who comprmises. This is not politics. It's about what's best for bitcoin. What's best for bitcoin the option that does not risk a network split, meaning SegWit or Status quo.
@_date: 2017-03-13 19:52:07
BU is bluffing with a hard fork. Not only would it be suicide for the miners supporting it, according to Eric they can only activate soft forks.
No fear. Let's call the bluff.
@_date: 2017-03-07 19:06:52
NO HARD FORKS.

No. They're Bitcoin Unlimited supporters. 
@_date: 2017-03-23 21:12:27
Is this what Desantis is working on?
BTW, I don't think BU can or will fork any time soon. BUGCoin would be hacked to pieces in a matter of hours. But I still think a PoW change must be at least in the cards as a "nuclear deterrent" kind of option.
Miners have gone berserk, and they need to know we can wipe their business away if they don't work for the network.

In Bitcoin, we don't negotiate with terrorists. We nuke 'em.
@_date: 2017-03-24 06:26:24
You're not using adversarial thinking. If we UASF, that means we don't need them anyway. After we UASF, we'd still end up changing PoW, specially knowing that they would try to take back the power they lost because of the UASF.
That's what BU is all about. Miners take control of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-24 14:08:48
Who cares. Non of them have the qualities of bitcoin, or the developers or the infrastructure.

you need to speak to Stephan Tual.. He's got some experience on this. Might Help you :P
@_date: 2017-01-29 23:49:24
So, what does this mean for the rest of miners who are running BU? Is the potential of losing mined blocks prevalent?

Isn't it funny how the same people that were screaming "The sky is falling!" are now calling for a solution that's going to take way longer to come to reality?
It's obvious this isn't about solutions. The whole thing is a big fillibuster against SegWit. Nothing more.
@_date: 2017-04-06 04:51:01

God damn it.
Just HODL. We'll be trough this soon enough.
No need to be nice to anyone. Big money coming in is irrelevant other than price. What makes bitcoin special is Immutability. Nothing more. Which means bitcoin, just as it is, minus ASICBOOST is already capable of turning the whole thing around. 
HODL through the bitmain nonsense, and you will be dearly rewarded.

When you say, Patch your miner, do you mean antbleed.com's or Bitmain's patch?
I can't trust Bitmain with firmware that I can't compile myself from open source code.
@_date: 2017-05-17 15:40:46
I agree. But also SW gives a small blocksize increase. We already know LN works. We can buy the time for it with the small blocksize increase.
@_date: 2017-05-16 22:51:23
Agreed. But the questions remain, and I beleive them to be quite important if we want SW in two months.
Getting home miners into the game would be a huge boost for BIP148 and a great opportunity for small miners to make a potential profit.

ETH just tanked big time. But that's not to say this block size thing is really getting on everyone's nerves. SegWit ,Thunder/Lightning and 2MB need to get here fast! 
@_date: 2016-05-26 17:20:05
I did sent a request form from their site. I've found that I get an answer faster if I post here than on their subreddit. That's why.
In fact, they did a great job answering here last time I did ;)
@_date: 2017-05-16 23:29:20
I believe this can happen once everyone realises BIP148 will be Lightning ready.
Once Lightning goes live on BIP148 chain, we are off to the races!

I wouldn't count on them going through with an actual node. Too much at stake for them, IMO.
Slush is known for letting users vote on proposals with hashing power. So the first pool to come to my mind that could allow for BIP148 would be him.
Have you tried approaching him for the same reason regarding BIP148?
Sorry to put so much on your plate, but I see you have a passion for this. Can we help you in any other way?

@_date: 2016-05-16 18:04:04
Yeah you're probably right.
Truth is, I've been using their service like crazy for a month now and this is the first time this happens. I guess someone messed up their fee algorithm today or something. They need to fix this.
@_date: 2016-05-16 20:46:14

I guess you're right regarding the minimum fee thing. Still, pretty much every wallet/node starts with at least a 0.0001 btc fee.
Now, regarding the bad luck thing, I don't think that's accurate. Since the transactions were relayed to the network 3 1/4 hours ago, 19 blocks have been mined. Which is exactly what should be expected in that time. 10 minutes per block, 6 blocks per hour, 18 blocks in 3 hours.
RBF needed indeed.

@_date: 2017-05-16 22:24:56
Do we know if they're running an actual BIP148 node or just a uacomment, if even that?
This still leaves the questions regarding home miners open. It would be great if people could contribute with hashing power.
AFAIK Bitfury has no mining pools to which people can direct miners to.
@_date: 2017-06-02 16:01:14
Hopefully, intent is all we need. The debate has already shifted from IF SegWit, to HOW TO SegWit.
