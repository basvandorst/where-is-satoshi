As long as you care that much about bitcoin's value in fiat money, bitcoin will never become a viable currency.

People building the infrastructure (ie. investing in it) want their fiat money investment back though. They either want bitcoins to trade for fiat money, or they want to keep the bitcoins to trade them for goods and services in a market where bitcoin has advantages over fiat money (such as illegal markets, or unregulated/untaxed transactions of legal goods and services).
Bitcoin is heavily exposed to fiat money and can easily be manipulated by entities that control that fiat money.
Giving bitcoin a permanent value in fiat money is the only solution to this problem. Then we'll see how many people are buying and mining bitcoin for anything other than gambling their fiat money.

The first criptocurrency to be designed with a fixed price will be the first criptocurrency to become immune to fiat money. 
Then we'll see how may people buy cripto for anything but to gamble their fiat money.

That's still USD because you're basing that purchasing power on how much bitcoin will attract fiat money gamblers and make its value rise in USD.
