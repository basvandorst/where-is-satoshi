The highly educated can still be idiots about thing they are ideologically blind or opposed to. Idiocy can be compartmentalised.
@_date: 2016-08-14 03:24:57
I think the fact that he felt he could lay down "knowledge" in the way he did, when he clearly had no clue what he was talking about, is somewhat idiotic. 
If he'd said, "I'm not sure about that, because iirc, it might be somewhat centralised behind one private company" then fine.

It's not about it being something he said I don't like. I couldn't care less. It's someone pontificating about something with certainty whilst displaying clear ignorance that is funny, and let's face it, pretty idiotic. 
It doesn't mean he *is* an idiot.

I've had a good overall experience with Wirex (formally e-coin). Virtual and physical, you can transfer onto it via fiat or bitcoin, you can buy bitcoin through the wallet, and the wallet also does real-time notifications of when transactions go through. Pretty good service too. Only down side is it doesn't work every time; I think it might be because it's mastercard rather than visa? Dunno. But used it for a variety of things so far.

I don't have the money lol. I'm just trying to trade my way up before the storm. Bought around half a btc, went down to 0.3, but in the last 6 months I've got it up to 3.75btc trading altcoins (mainly riding $arch from 4k to between 45k and 70k, and flipping $hyper several times the last couple of months). That's even with a fairly conservative risk management system of spreading between 8-10 coins..

I came to similar conclusions a year ago. Another indicator is that biological information is cumulative, not transformative, aka a blockchain of sorts.

@_date: 2017-12-30 13:30:19
Agree to an extent..
It's like the difference between weather and climate. I don't play with coins at the top of their long-term price cycle because they are so unpredictable. 
But to make a killer portfolio, I barely need to look at the tech beyond making sure its a legit project. The chart is all I need: just pick a bunch at the low point of their long-term price cycle. 
Much more predictable over a longer time period.

atm trade vrc, blk, hyper, sys, via, cann, dash, sdc, doge, arch, dgb and a few others.
Basically I stay the hell away from new coins to avoid scams. I only spend 10-15 minutes a day checking my balances. It's a very low time/low risk strategy but the diversification keeps it interesting.
tbh, at least half that growth was from buying arch at around 4k and buying/selling a few times, but on the whole grabbing most of the growth and selling some at 68k and the rest at 45k.

I am self-employed and trying to create a successfull consultancy business. Unfortunately it feels like I'm ahead of my time since I am a complexity theory expert, and the lessons from complexity theory go against most traditional strains of thought. People don't tend to like what it has to teach, particularly regarding power, authority, and control. 
Perhaps in ten years time it will be different, but this economy sucks balls.

He doesn't really like to do labels, but if pressed IIRC he would call himself socially libertarian, fiscally conservative.
He is still very much anti-establishment though. Also, a lot of his thought regarding history is very much in tune with complexity theory, which as with me is reflected in his politics too. In that sense, he understands emergence as a concept, which for me makes him not incompatible with anarchism. 
As for recognising the evil.. I don't think you get to immerse yourself in ancient history like he does without recognising it. It's quite a common theme in his work to really highlight, not gloss over or glorify, the human suffering involved. Same goes for his politics I find.

Why do I seem to be a bad trader lol? I've gone +1000% in 6 months!
I maintain very strong risk management (diversify over 10 or so coins - very rarely more than 30% in one coin unless very confident), I only trade a small selection of established coins, and I have patience in spades so rarely sell lower than I buy.

As a complexity theorist, I concur.
It may be irreducible and unpredictable, but at large scales that limitation recedes (e.g. don't try and call tops and bottoms, do focus on long-term price cycle and recognising parabolia).
In the same way, I don't try to time the collapse of the US, but I recognise it's going parabolic.
@_date: 2018-02-03 03:16:25
This is genuinely uncharted territory. Not so much in fiat; that's standard, just even grander scale now. 
But we've never seen a fiat collapse in a world with cryptocurrencies. I'm sure I'm not the only one who has spent the last several years wondering what would happen.
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:08:10
It would hit six-figures next cycle.
In fact, unless some Black Swan event existential to bitcoin happens in the next two years, I'd say it's a certainty.
Basically, if there's another cycle, it'll go decent six-figures.
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:38:07
Not really ironic. It's actually a tautology.
If it doesn't reach that level, it will be because of a Black Swan event.
Black Swan events are common af. All it means is something unpredicted.
Bitcoin has been in price discovery mode this entire time; it's a new technology, and the ecosystem as a whole holds genuinely revolutionary potential imo. 
Bitcoins hash rate dominance (security) and standing means it's going to be around for some time yet, even if its primary role became simply being a base trading pair for the rest of the market.
At this point, I think the onus is on people claiming that the succession of price cycles is at an end to explain why they think that, more than on people saying that price cycles will continue baring an existential black swan event. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 17:54:16
That "only thing going for it" is still significant. It brings security.
The way the entire sector is growing, I need a reason why bitcoin wont pump again. Just the fact that there is so much money in it means there needs to be an actual existential problem for it to not do so imo, not just the subjective opinion of individuals.
@_date: 2018-02-02 17:58:20
As a complexity theorist, when I see growth like this over the last nine years, I feel confident assuming that the pattern will continue until an existential Black Swan event happens, or the market as a whole has matured.
Since neither of those things appear close, I'm comfortable predicting six-figure Bitcoin in two years.
@_date: 2018-02-03 18:28:48
Sorry, you are saying crypto is "the" bubble, as though the entire stock market hasn't been inflated in a bubble by unsustainable monetary policy and corporate buybacks?
Jesus, crypto pales to the bubbles inflating in the global economy. You seen the state of housing in London and Vancouver? Crypto is nothing in comparison.
You are defending a system that has created a Gilded Age based on speculative bubbles by criticising a nascent market that's a fraction of the size.. for being a bubble.
Bubbles are how shit grows. It doesn't mean we have to tie everything about our lives to the health of markets that repeatedly bubble and collapse.
We could create a system that mitigates those risks. Instead, the rich just take everything and the little guy gets fucked.
Nice system.
@_date: 2018-02-21 02:26:39
Social Democracy.
It's pretty hard to escape the meta narrative going on here: Liberalism, Inequality, Gilded Age, Great Depression, War, Social Democracy, Redistribution, Equality, Growth of Middle-Classes, Neoliberalism, Inequality, Gilded Age..
Just cycles of capitalists corrupting shit so they get filthy rich, then shit has to get super bad before anyone in power accepts that 0.1% of the population owning half of all wealth is about to end with pitchforks up the arse.
Can we not just try and avoid the war part at least this time?
@_date: 2018-02-03 17:00:54
Crypto is different.
Dynamics don't change.. yes, you are right about that. 
But as systems get more complex, its organisation and outcomes can change.
We've already seen such a change in living memory, with the removal of the Gold standard. 
Incidentally why do you arbitrarily blame "speculative markets" for causing great harm to some separate "economy", as though the economy itself is not a speculative market that is to blame for its own collapses?
Crypto didn't inflate this bubble. Nor, I doubt, will it even trigger this coming collapse. 
Fiat didn't "win". Global debt is going parabolic, society is collapsing under existential levels of inequality, we are sleepwalking into debt-serfdom, and it's all inherently unsustainable.

At the moment, the state has explicit sovereignty. It could, if it chose, take corporations money. 
As part of corporate sovereignty, a cryptocurrency would take that power away. I've written a small chapter on corporations moving toward soveriegnty using cryptos. Pm me your email address and ill send it if you like.

Not sure how that works. Wouldnt digitisation make theft less expensive?

This isn't gerrymandering though, since he didn't leave any timeframes out. It was the same on all of them, and all the choices were pre-determined by the software.
It's still only a quirk, something of mild interest. But I don't think it's fair to say it's gerrymandering.

In the UK, the cuts were back-loaded to this parliament, so the squeeze is only ramping up here.

Thanks for asking this, cant believe I didnt think to myself! Had trouble finding one.

Doesn't austerity against the poor count as a phase of the crisis?

I have had a good experience with e-coin. I think they are now called Wirex. they do physical cards, but I just use the virtual card. It's mastercard I think, so doesn't work everywhere, but it's quick (When I paid my wife's phonebill, I saw in real time that it has gone through before the lady at customer services I was on the phone to).
They do dollar, sterling, or euro cards. You can top up the card with bitcoin, with other cards, and you can buy bitcoin too. Also, the service I have got through email and twitter has been pretty good to.

That's what I initially thought. That's why I thought it was mildly interesting with no actual insight. 
But then someone pointed out there was no 1yr option showing, so he probably did pick the timeframes as well.

So you think it likely that a Bank, or other International Financial Institute, has looked into such a plan? What's the smallest estimate for the number of mining factories/organisations one would need to buy to get 51%, anyone?

ah, good spot :)

Firstly, I think your title could be accurate without any conscious intent. 
Secondly, even if it were, its important to remember no one controls shit. People might think they do, but no one could open this pandoras box and expect to know what will happen ten years hence.
@_date: 2015-03-14 15:49:53
Corporate sovereignty.
Control over money is one of the central planks of sovereignty along with monopoly of legitimate force. With seasteading etc, and many in silicon valley openly talking about exiting the nation state, a corporation owned crypto currency takes that a step further.

Because there are now how many trillions in the Seychelles and other tax haven out of circulation? Ironic thing is, doesn't this paradox kinda prove rather conclusively that trickle down economics doesn't work? If it didn't, wouldn't we have far greater inflation?
@_date: 2015-03-10 13:12:15
I would be very surprised if they didn't. I see the charge levied at OKCoin quite a bit on Twitter, and now I see a bunch of people have resigned from there today? 
I'd also be very surprised if coin devs, exchanges, and pumpers hadn't teamed up to coordinate at some point or several.
I'm just wondering if the unregulated money involved means something along the lines of 'if you think it would be an easy scam, it's already being done'?
@_date: 2015-02-26 20:49:16
Scam. Everyone knows Finland doesn't exist.

I see no reason why it couldn't be to the euro what local currencies are here in the UK. Just a token of value limited to use in Greece. 
If the euro can't compete with something like that thrown in the mix, then maybe they should have thought about that earlier? 
Economics is what we make of it. Far from being the religious camps it's made out to be by ideologues, it's a blank canvas waiting to be experimented on imo.

Nope. Definitely Finland. I read it on Reddit once.

I don't do religions, I was just floating an idea with historical precedent. I think you're projecting.

Meh, if they are making it from scratch, I'm sure someone cleverer than me could systematise Gessell's ideas into a crypto-currency to either make it impossible or costly.

For those that are lazy, here it is: 
10.c By 2030, reduce to less than 3 per cent the transaction costs of migrant remittances and eliminate
remittance corridors with costs higher than 5 per cent.
By 2030! It hasn't even been agreed and it's already been annihilated! Maybe someone should get a hold of them before they make themselves look silly.

So, you saying that you can select the time-frames that appear top-left of each shot on the software he's using? I hadn't seen that anywhere before myself.

Im sorry, but regulars on r/bitcoin casually dismissing Vinay as a nobody is just too funny.
@_date: 2015-02-26 22:44:11
Is it not? Genuinely surprised by that. I mean, of course it isnt, it doesnt exist! 
@_date: 2016-07-29 15:59:27
Oh come on! Theymos censoring debate did not determine the outcome. The *whole point* of Bitcoin is that one person doesn't have the power, whether directly or indirectly. What hyperbole.

Just in case people think i'm being serious:

Surely if they wanted to stimulate growth, you could simply code in a system whereby stationary coins lose value? Wasnt it Gessell idea, enacted in a german region, that worked so well the place actually grew amidst hyperinflation, and was subsequently quashed by the state? I think they worked out that during the 18 months it was in effect, each unit of currency passed hands over 400 times.
