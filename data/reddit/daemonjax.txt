The fees aren't a percentage, it's a flat amount of bitcoin.  The price in fiat is increasing because the price of bitcoin is increasing.
You can still transfer for a very low fee.  You just have to wait a while for it to be confirmed.  Last time I checked, it takes 3 days for my bank to do a bank to bank transfer.
People want bitcoin to replace credit cards.  That's not going to happen, just like credit cards didn't replace banks.  Something else will need to be built ontop of the bitcoin blockchain -- another layer -- that works more like a credit card if that's going to happen.

Because the IRS has stated crypto is not a currency -- it's property. Other property, such as gold bullion, can be traded with like-kind and have the capital gains deferred under 1031.
The IRS was silent on the subject whether crypto can be traded as like-kind.  Conservatives said no (I was in that group), but with the NEW tax law that's in effect Jan 1st 2018, they say no.  Since it's NEW and not in effect until starting Jan 1st 2018, that implies in 2017 it IS like-kind.  Likewise, under the NEW tax law, gold bullion for gold bullion is also NOT like-kind, since it's not real estate.  Can't do car for car anymore, either.  That's a big change.

If bitcoin loses 50-75% of its value, that's not a correction, it's a crash. 
A correction is if, say, bitcoin gains 50% of its value, and then loses 50% of those gains (so it's up overall 25%).  
Corrections can happen the other way, too.  Like after a crash.
Anyways, no one knows if/when the next crash or correction is.  People might sound like they're certain one or the other, but it's just a guess.  Sometime it's an educated guess, but no one is 100% certain of anything.

Bots that are manipulating the book to make it looks like there is pressure in one direction.

It dips because people are cashing out -- they do the math on what they hold and what they bought it at, and the regret that they'd have if they didn't cash out outweighs the possibility of it going higher in the short term.  These aren't small numbers.
Then it goes back up because a LOT of people are waiting in the sidelines to buy at dips because it's "too expensive now". For example, I know people at work who would buy a ton of bitcoin if it dropped to the 6k range, but won't pull the trigger at all when it's above 8k.  They're interested and watching it, but they see the price and it's too much for them to handle.

I think that pretty much what a short is going to look like on these futures is someone betting 20k by end of 2018, and someone going long is going to say 50k by end of 2018.  I don't think anyone is really going to short as in the price is going to go down -- so in that sense it should reduce volatility.
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:54:30
True.  The danger is in overtrading -- the feeling that you have to do SOMETHING.  But we don't.  Sometimes we should just hold when opportunities don't present themselves to us.  We can't all see every opportunity.
When in doubt (doesn't always pan out), I'll trade back to btc and take a very minor loss... but overall, I've been able to increase my btc position way more than I could just by buying more with my paychecks.  At this point, my paycheck contributions would be a drop in the bucket. :(

I think bitcoin will likely be around 50k by the end of 2018.  
But I know maybe it won't.  And for some reason I NEED to sell X amount of bitcoin at a higher price than it is today at a future date in order to keep on living (say I have no other source of income).
If I sell a futures contract for 40k, 30k, or 20k, that's still a "short" on my position even though it's around 15k today.  
And that's why they say it will help curb volatility -- we'll have less dips.
I don't think we're going to see 6k future contracts, otherwise they'd just sell now at 15k.

Someone has to go long for someone else to go short -- it's how it works.  The wealth is transferred, not minted.
But no one knows the future, but I do know this:  We're going to hear more about bitcoin in the news as time goes on, which increases adoption, which increases demand.  Right now, when we do hear about bitcoin in the news, the message is fear with a token disclaimer to cover their own ass because they know they don't know what they're talking about.

I'll definitely look into it more when it goes live, but I've been doing well hedging bitcoin with alts (against satoshis, not USD).  
But I'm long on bitcoin in general.  I trade to acquire more bitcoin, regardless of its USD price.  Maybe others feel differently -- I'm sure large scale miners do.

It does work, but what works best is trading in a way between bitcoin and altcoins to aquire more bitcoin instead of trading to acquire more usd.  Otherwise, you'd be stuck trading between usd and usdt pairs, which would kinda suck.

1) Capital gains tax applies when you sell your coins for fiat or exchange them for another coins after you've held those coins for more than one year -- otherwise the gains or handled just like regular income.
2) You're supposed to pay taxes whenever you sell or trade the coin for another coin -- it's not just when you cash out and it hits your bank account.  Yeah, it's a lot of book keeping.
You can choose to play by your own rules, and maybe you'll get away with it for a while... but the IRS does expect you to play by their rules.

I'd create a linux vm using virtualbox with an encrypted home folder and run electrum on it as a wallet.  Send a very small amount of bitcoin to it (to be tested later). Then, I'd use 7-zip to store and encrypt the vdi file (which is the virtual disk for the vm).  Burn the 7zipped encrypted file to a dvd, and also store a copy in trusted cloud storage.  
Finally, test that you can access the wallet from the encyrpted copies and that the bitcoin you originally sent is in there.  Ensure you securely delete any unencrypted copies, and that you store all required password info somewhere safe.  If you're paranoid about having password/login info written down anywhere (you should be), then you need to come up with your own handwritten cypher using a one time pad.

In the end did well -- the constant dread of knowing it was going to shoot back up made me wary enough that I saw it when it came, and I think I bought back in just a couple percentage higher than my last sell.
Pretty stressful, though.  The bitcoin market never closes.  Had to monitor it on my day job.  Meh.  If I had to do it over, I'd have just held and kept buying more.  Made less, but 0 stress.

It's first in first out.  You'd still be buying the product with your oldest coins, likely realizing gains, causing it to be a taxable event.  Well, it's taxable event even if it's at a loss, but you get what I'm saying.

I moved everything to a bitcoin core wallet to have the most options for splitting.
What if people sell their bitcoin gold and just buy more bitcoin with it?  That's what I plan to do, anyways.
Price doesn't drop, then.
And if it does drop for a bit, great -- I'll just buy more.
Of course the most optimal thing would be to know the future.

SSDs use trim which APFS supports.
Some operating systems / file systems don't support trim... or, at least they didn't when SSDs were new.  Motherboard chipset has to support it too.
Basically he's screwed.  I'd still try to recover it, though.  But... it's probably not going to work.  If I wasn't me, I'd contact a professional data recovery company instead of dicking around.  Paying 2k to recover 40k sounds like a good deal.

There's nothing stopping people from using crypto on craig's list right now.
Ebay can/will work just as well with crypto as it does with fiat since a lot of their success comes from Ebay being a trusted 3rd party the exchange of goods between people who don't trust each other -- they'd just have to get the goods first, instead of the seller shipping directly to the buyer... then they'd ship it to the buyer and transfer the btc to the seller.
Another way ebay could work is if it simply also becomes a crypto exchange.  That's probably easier, now that I think about it.

1) bitcoin core
2) bitcoin core, but any wallet that lets you control your private keys is good enough because you can always put that private key into bitcoin core if you want to -- the two reasons not to run a full node is disk space and bandwidth.
3) Hold and buy more whenever you feel like it.  Buy even more when it's looks like it's down.

Good idea, but way too late.
Almost all the hashpower for bitcoin (and any other coin using the SHA-256 algorithm) is concentrated in ASICs.  
If bitcoin forked to equihash or lyra2REv2 the problem isn't that ASICs would be developed for those algorithms (they wouldn't) -- it's that the ASICs would _continue_ to mine the old chain.
Maybe if they also included a per block difficulty adjustment and publicized the shit out of the Anti-ASIC fork for months for people to get their GPUs ready.  I dunno.  The thing is, we already have equihash and lyra2rev2 coins to mine.  If we think ASICs are really that much of a problem that they'll kill bitcoin (they haven't yet), we could dump our bitcoins and buy those.
One of the main reasons that bitcoin is worth so much is precisely because it's completely unprofitable to mine on CPU or GPU -- if you want some, you must buy some outright (or buy an ASIC).

Spending bitcoin follows first in first out rules for tax purposes.  So, no, spend and replace does not make it a non-taxable event.
Remember, it's not a currency -- it's property.
You can pretend it's currency all you want.  The IRS will disagree with you, though.  Go ahead and take that chance if you want, but you can't ask everyone to take that chance with you.
That's what the $600 limit bill is about: The CryptoCurrency Tax Fairness Act

The gains are realized upon conversion to another crypto currency, just as if you sold them for fiat first and then bought the alt coin with those dollars.
Just like the gains from selling gold coins are realized when trading them for silver coins.
The IRS will get their money.  Just accept it.
If you want to avoid paying taxes, then:
1) hold your bitcoin; or
2) offset your gains with losses by:
a) selling other investments at a loss
b) contribute more to your IRA this year

Yups.  Good advice.
And this is why you should keep multiple _encrypted_ backups of important data, one of those being in a trust cloud server like amazon glacier -- it's dirt cheap.  I'd trust Google Drive, too, if doing it on the cheap... just make sure you're not using 2fa via sms because your cell phone company has shit security.

It's a taxable event even if you don't sell after a fork.  You still receive the coin (even if only in theory), and they have value at that moment.

1) Create your own one time use cypher: 
2) Apply that cypher to your 12 word seed and write down the encrypted text with the spaces removed (you won't need them).
3) Store copies of the cypher key _seperately_ from your encrypted text.

You're likely to get scalped while working on a block by the larger mining groups, wasting your work.
Just mine in a pool or use nicehash.

You cash out at retirement.  
Retirement is when you stop making money by means other than your investments -- Money made primarily in order to invest more towards your retirement.
When you do retire, you still don't cash out everything at once -- you take out a percentage yearly based on:
1) How long you expect to live;
2) How much you saved;
3) What the average expected yearly returns of your investments are;
Bitcoins should probably be the last thing in your portfolio to be liquidated.
Don't forget to pay your taxes.
@_date: 2017-10-22 18:32:37
You wouldn't cash it out all at once... not unless an even better investment opportunity came along.

You'd have to research asic resistant crypto currencies if you still want to gpu or cpu mine.
Generally, you're better off just buying the coins directly with the money you would have spent on mining hardware.
Unless you don't pay for electricity for some reason.  Like, if you're stealing it from your workplace or parents.

That's not really accurate.
On coinbase/gdax, if you want to deposit USD funds for a later purchase on the market, then yeah you gotta wait for the bank transfer to clear.
But if you just want to buy btc at whatever the price is right NOW, then you can instant buy with a cerdit card or bank transfer.  With the credit card you get the bitcoin NOW as well, but with the bank transfer you have to wait for it to clear to get your coins -- but you are locked in at that price the moment you agreed to buy them.

The price of BTC would have to remain stable and predictable before it becomes used to buy stuff you don't need.  
Otherwise, it'll remain an investment -- something you sell only when you have to.
EDIT: Well, unless you were paid in bitcoin directly.  Then I guess you'd spend some of it on bullshit stuff.
