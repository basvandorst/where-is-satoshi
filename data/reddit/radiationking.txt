To be honest, it's far more common for people to set up auto payment using direct withdrawal from their bank account.

For Chrome also make sure you change the content settings to Click-to-play, that way no plugin will auto-launch content (flash etc).

Electrum stores all wallet related information on the PC, it's only checking the server to confirm transactions.  It also has support for offline wallets and deterministic wallets (you backup the seed value and can regenerate all future addresses from that value, allowing for a single backup that never needs to be updated).

Yup, entirely and both on the fiat side as well as the bitcoin side.  It's not actually a wallet you own/control it's an exchange service with a wallet style interface.

Ah okay, that makes sense, I didn't spend that much time watching.  Nice and clean though, good job on it.

There is a big issue of trust with services such as Crypho, it is not a local application that can be audited.  It's javascript served by their web server, this means that a rogue employee, hacker or through coercion by the government could serve you slightly modified js that leaks your keys/data.

That or its just reporting failed password attempts and they were trying to brute force the password.

I completely agree with you.  I just had to comment after looking at their site and seeing:
"End-to-end encrypted
256bit AES encryption, with the encryption keys only held by the members. No-one can read your data, not even us."
But you're absolutely right, using PGP is not a walk in the park for most users.  S/MIME in some ways can be easier being that it's implemented in more email clients across platforms.  Even then that only covers email and then you have to deal with IM or other communication channels with a different technology such as OTR and it becomes a serious hassle.

Not officially, but someone already covered that service.

Hopefully more competition to provide better services and lower fees.  cavirtex.com charges excessively high fees compared to other non-canadian exchanges (3% unless you do more than 120BTC worth of transactions in 3 months).

Nope, ASICMiner USB Erupter, ~330 MH/s.  Used to cost 2BTC per device and are now selling at 1BTC.  So slightly better costs than the K1 and not to mention available today with no pre-ordering.
EDIT: The photo in the product description on asicgigahash.com is actually the ASICMiner devices (bit of false representation there).  The Klondike design is purely an open-source board designed by BKKCoins that uses the Avalon chips.

I can't disagree there was a high level of mania towards the final big climb, but believe it or not Reddit is not the center of the universe, especially in regards to bitcoin.

No, they are only ~330MH/s a far cry from 2GH and AM is selling them for 2BTC with a minimum order of 50.

Completely agree on this, either Armory or Electrum will allow for the generation of deterministic wallets allowing for a single backup of the seed.  You can then restore the wallet at any time in the future and have a record of all previous transactions.
Print the seed and store in a safety deposit box.
On a side note, both clients also support offline wallets as well which provide the security of paper wallets, but are imo simpler to use over the long term.  Especially in regards to change addresses and backups.

Even easier is small claims court with no lawyer required.  It would cost PayPal more to deal with than the reversed charge.  Though he'd likely be banned from using PayPal in the future the outcome is going to be in his favor with full documentation including delivery confirmation.

That just gave me an idea; personally I don't want to run a web wallet service, but would be interesting if blockchain.info or someone could implemented it or a variation.
Basically allow the creation of a throwaway login for exactly this purpose.  Essentially a sub-account login that has limitations defined when it's created as well as hides all parent account information when logged in.
Some limitations could be:   
* Expiration, by time or number of logins (one-time use for example)
* Max amount of BTC allow to transfer
* GEO IP limitations
This way if you do use an insecure device you don't have to worry about the security of your primary.
Of course you could always have two wallets and transfer between them treating one as insecure, but if you're using a web wallet it would be nice to leverage some of the control it can provide.

It depends on how it's implemented, if the site supports Yubikey's OTP then yes, but if it's in static mode Yubikey acts as a USB keyword and simply enters the password for you.  In this case malware/key loggers are able to capture the password, but you are pretty much protected against a brute force attack.

If this is meant just as a dual boot and not a completely offline wallet then I would say Electrum.  The reason being is Armory needs a fully sync'ed Bitcoin-QT client with full blockchain.  This means if you rarely boot into the bitcoin side that you'll have to wait for it to resync depending on your purposes.
Electrum however will always be up to date and can get to your business right away.

Some suggestions:
I noticed you have debug alert boxes popping up when you select a product from the dropdown list, ex, pick an iPad Mini, then select the 32GB model.  Bam, alert box.
Put the price on the front page with the product. For products with multiple models put either the lowest price or display both the lowest and the highest as a range.  I don't want to have to click through multiple stages just to see the prices.
Your order button does not have enough contrast.  White letters on a gray gradient.. no embossing isn't really that cool, readable is better!
Just a nitpick, but when you are on a product page and there's multiple drop lists align the lists, it will look much better.  Add some spacing between them and the order button as well.
On the front page clean up your padding as well as shrink *all* the images (bit&amp;buy, 10% discount, free shipping/delivered images).  They are way too big and there's too much whitespace padding everywhere.
TL;DR work on the polish
EDIT: 5 minutes with Paint and could still be much better; [

Is the Android client; I don't have an iPhone so I haven't looked into clients for that, but I do know that the blockchain.info web wallet has an iOS client.  Maybe one of the Apple users on the sub can respond on that one. I'm not a fan of web wallets, but its an option.
Bitcoin Wallet generates/stores the wallet on the phone itself (your private keys are never on a server), but does allow for encrypted import/export options to back it up.
It also keeps a local copy of the trimmed blockchain headers (similar to the Electrum client -- ~18MB) used to validate transactions.  No reliance on a 3rd party web services for that either. It's basically a lightweight bitcoin-qt.
Personally for security reasons I would only keep as much BTC on the smartphone wallet as I would physical cash on my person, but its great for quick purchases.  With QR codes you point the camera and confirm, BTC sent (you can do phone-to-phone transfers this way or by using NFC as well).

It looks like you aren't taking into account the varying difficulty levels.
This is what causes the ratios to bounce around on dustcoin.com.  When a bunch of hashing power jumps to Terracoin for example the difficulty spikes and the profitability plummets even if the value of TRC went up since difficulty controls the rate coins can be acquired.
EDIT: To be more helpful take a look at --    
This provides the calculations needed to estimate block time given a set difficulty and hash rate (hash rate is arbitrary if you are only looking to calculate ratios).  Since you know the number of reward coins per block you can figure out the coin ratio over a set period and use that to adjust the profitability percentages.  The formula linked of course only related to SHA256 based coins. You'll need to find a similar formula for the scrypt types.

No, ~~zero contact information~~, nothing to suggest a proper business. No real shipping information (carrier etc), return/exchange policies.  Order form is not validated in any way.
I would recommend they look at existing e-commerce sites and see what makes it look/feel professional.  Then from there it's a bit of chicken and egg problem of gaining trust/reputation.
EDIT: my bad, there is a contact address on the FAQ, but no phone.

Absolutely agreed.  I liked the shopping cart integration, nice and simple.
Every time I see a QR-code though it makes me want to generate a cash on hand wallet for my phone!

Its the same as keeping cash in an exchange account and only buying enough BTC for a particular transaction.
Your holdings are in fiat instead of BTC.
This is a middleman service to simplify that process and streamline it.
