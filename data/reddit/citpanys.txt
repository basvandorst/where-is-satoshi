Money isn´t lost. It´s just someone elses. :)
Bitcoin can be lost though, which only decreases supply and raises the price.

It's called arbitrage trading and the same question is asked several times every day. ;)

I`m afraid no one really knows how to anwer your question. 
Market cap is the worth of all circulating btc. This has only a marginal correlation to the actually mined btc. 
According to coinmarketcap the btc market cap is currently 199.143.558.290 USD, because there are 16.721.825 BTC circulating at a current price of 11.909,20 USD each.
At the current circulating supply: if btc dropped to 50 USD the market cap would drop to 836.091.250 USD.

Wow, seems like i totally brainfarted there and completely misread. Sorry about that.

Of course it does. I just found the sharp contrast between supply and demand fascinating and funny. And exciting.

I know it isn´t. I just make it complicated. That´s my point. :/

First: I think it´s awesome what you plan for your son and i am doing something similar, but might i make a suggestion?  
When he turns 18, don´t just give him the lump sum. Instead encourage him to get a socially meaningful, but typically low paying occupation - like working in an old folks home or even voluntary work - by giving him a comfortable additional salary out of the savings.
I am not a native english speaker so i am not finding the right words right now, but we all know if we´d receive 150k on our 18th birthday we would have burnt through that in no time. ;)
