Cryptos don't facilitate money laundering, they just, with current regulations in place, make it much easier than going through your bank route. And inflation has nothing to do with money laundering. What I'm saying is, we need more rules in our respective countries to make Bitcoin and other cryptos work. Because currently, we're not even close.

Every transaction is transparent, but identities are anonymous. Thus, when people send or receive money, their real identities are not linked to their bitcoin usernames. Thus, even if you were to tell your government about your bitcoin username, your government will have no idea who I am. Thus, it is really difficult for the receiver of bitcoins to explain the source of the funds without implicating the identity of the sender, and explaining the whole transaction. Without this, then money laundering is extremely easy. If exchanges pay out any sum of money no questions asked, and the sender explains his/her transactions as "virtual currency trades", then that's the easiest way to launder money, ever.
And because they 'catch' these banks laundering money, that means that anti-money laundering regulations actually work. Even HSBC was caught facilitating money laundering a few years ago, and it was Fined heavily. I am with you. I want virtual currencies to work. Legally and effortlessly though.
Yes, inflation has to do with managing wealth. But every citizen wants that, because they vote for it. If you do do not like your government, vote for a different one. One that likes deflation.
Bitcoin needs rules/regulations a.k.a. laws, that Parliaments enact, to work. The whole identity/money laundering issue mentioned above. I'm not talking about the design of virtual currencies. They work perfectly. They are software programs designed to do something, and I also believe they do it well.
