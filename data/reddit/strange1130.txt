If you are in the US then it is a legal requirement that the exchanges take that data.  So unless you want to scout around for shady sites, then no.
Are you by any chance under 18?
@_date: 2017-08-18 18:48:11
Nope -- see my other post, if your US it's a legal requirement.
Your best bet would be getting an 18+ friend to buy and send to you.

Right now I'm using Coinbase, and Coinbase -&gt; Bittrex for Altcoins (in a very light way, probably 80/20) but I believe there are cheaper tx fees to be had on sites like Kraken and Gemini etc.  (US here)

Well this dude said the blockchain could be hacked and linked to an article about exchanges being hacked -- isn't that both incorrect and misleading?

Some of this material is covered here in Chapter 4 which I have not fully digested (and will probably need to read this book twice to understand the concepts!)
Don’t worry too much about the complicated charts and calculations, the general concepts are all you need to understand.
Specifically, [this image]( describes the relationship between a private key, a public key, and a bitcoin address:








So basically what that means is that the  Bitcoin Address is calculated from the Private Key, but the private key cannot be “reverse engineered” from the address.  That’s one of the key fundamentals of bitcoin.
As you can see, the Private Key is the most important part – if you lose that (aka your computer crashes, etc) you are out of luck, and if someone else has it they can use it to take your coin.
As far as my understanding goes the “12 word phrase” is basically just an easier to keep track of Private Key – since the twelve words can be run through an algorithm to calculate your private key (and remembering 12 words is much easier than a long hexadecimal chain of letters and numbers).  But again, I am not quite there yet!
On all exchanges you should have the option to send funds to a bitcoin address – just like we saw above, these will attribute those to your private key, so they are then “yours.”  On coinbase it’s super easy, you just go to the send tab, input the amount and address, pay the fee and off you go.  I don’t know anything about apps because I keep my actual transactions solely to my home computer, I don’t log onto any of those sites from work or my phone etc.  
(If anyone more knowledgeable than myself is reading this and I said anything wrong please correct me!  I like typing about it because it helps me reinforce my knowledge but I am still a total beginner)

Uhhh you should definitely not be investing money you aren't okay with losing, that's rule

All signs point to yes.

That's not how wallets work.  You're looking for an exchange.

TL;DR HODL
@_date: 2017-08-18 15:35:50


if it were that easy, everyone would be doing it.
(if you want to mine you can look into Ethereum, but while I don't know your specs I'm 99% sure you won't be able to do it on a MBP -- need at least 3GB GPU)
@_date: 2017-08-18 16:24:41
makes sense
@_date: 2017-08-18 18:15:30
A little too early to make any judgments -- its down what ~$300 from the ATH?
Don't forget: HODL
@_date: 2017-08-17 21:06:01
you would need to have btc sent to you before you can send it.  You can't buy btc within bitcoin core.  if you want to buy btc with fiat currency aka USD you'll probably need to use an exchange like Coinbase, Kraken, Gemini etc (there are other options too like a btc atm, or finding someone local to sell to you etc, but that's probably the easiest bet for you)
Don't get hung up on having "1" coin -- like, you said you bought 1 litecoin since it's cheap, but if you see btc growing faster than litecoin (as I think most of us do) it would be smarter to put that same amount of USD into BTC - don't forget you can buy fractions of coins.
my personal plan is to put about 80% of my "crypto investment" if you will into BTC and spread the other 20% around several other coins but I know that a lot of people here are all-in on BTC.

Does Forbes often release articles that contradict each other?  Just the other day we all saw the article dumping on BTC, saying nobody should own them.

Yes you can mine Ethereum and turn a profit.  You'll still need a specialized rig

I am still learning myself!  So I don't know enough to say in terms of short term valuation.  
My strategy (a common one) is to practice what's called "DCA investing" -- it's a pretty simple concept that basically just means making the same investment each week (a value that you are comfortable with potentially losing!) regardless of the current value.  So this morning I put in my $100, and next week I'll put in my $100 even if the BTC has dropped, or even if it has increased -- we are in it to hodl and wait for the long run!  (Though to be honest with you if it takes a big hit I will probably move some funds around and invest more than I normally would as I don't see it going anywhere but up long term)
In terms of your second question -- if you buy BTC on an exchange then yes you don't technically "own" that BTC yet since they control your private key -- they could technically abscond with your coins and you would be powerless to stop it.  That's why teh recommendation is not to leave big amounts on the exchanges -- you just need to balance it with absorbing the transaction fees of course.  If the computer dies and your wallet is not backed up yes you are out of luck, but you can certainly back up the wallet -- this is where my knowledge gets a little bit fuzzy, I haven't quite got there yet.  You can set up a "seed" or 12 word phrase which is your proof in order to back up.  I need to get that sorted out myself, right now I still only own a small enough value that I'm not too worried, but as I continue to invest it will become necessary.

Sounds like that guy has no idea / doesn't care at all about the actual technology behind bitcoin.

From the side
Download Bitcoin Core
Bitcoin Core is the backbone of the Bitcoin network. Almost all Bitcoin wallets rely on Bitcoin Core in one way or another. If you have a fairly powerful computer that is almost always online, you can help the network by running Bitcoin Core. You can also use Bitcoin Core as a very secure Bitcoin wallet.
    Latest stable version: 0.14.2 (June 2017) [BitTorrent]
    You MUST verify the integrity of this software before running it.
@_date: 2017-08-17 19:59:29
sounds like you need to do some learning about the blockchain
@_date: 2017-08-15 17:55:14
Yeah I posted a similar question on the noobies thread but is there any good equilibrium for average transaction size to be able to balance security (ie buy and move to wallet) but offset fees eating a large percentage of the value?  If I'm putting in $25 bucks a week but only receiving $20 worth of BTC or whatever it will end up, that seems like a big loss.

Why does he like Gold but not Bitcoin?  
He goes on to say:


Sure, that makes sense.  But it's not like I can ship the IRS an ounce of gold to pay off my taxes this year.  I'd have to sell it for fiat.  Guess what else I can sell for fiat to pay my taxes?

Also a beginner but I'd like to take a stab at these since I am trying to increase my knowledge (someone more experienced please correct anything if I made any mistakes!):


Not exactly sure what you mean by "in the market."  You can't do anything with BTC that you don't have yet.  The price you purchased the BTC at is locked in.  You can see how much BTC you will be receiving in the app.


Correct, you will get the amount of BTC you bought at the purchase price, so if it increases or decreases in that week, the value of your BTC will change accordingly.


Yes, you should move it to another wallet.  "Cold Storage" (offline storage) is the best bet.
As for what you should do?  Well that's obvious right?  HODL.

I don't know if I see it going back below 3K because I think there are a whole lot of people, myself included, willing to make even bigger investments if it does start to drop that low.
