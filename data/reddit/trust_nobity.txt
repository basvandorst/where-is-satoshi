I don't know the HOW exactly; but I assume he either hacked me over the network, or compromised my computer when I left the room.

I appreciate this, but I didn't post this for charity. All of the advice I received was worth more than money could buy. I love this sub.

Not that it would have been very hard for him. He could have accessed my netbook while I walked away for a moment, to talk on the phone or to take a shower. I know so very little about hacking somebody's computer; and now I've learned an important life lesson. If you have something valuable on your HD, then make sure to lock it down whenever you are not immediately in front of the screen. My roommate took advantage of the fact that he lived with me and had many opportunities to steal from me. He failed because he didn't keep his transactions anonymous (enough) on the blockchain, so I was able to track my coins back to him. But it took hours and hours and hours, and many sleepless nights to do so. Not that it matters much. The coins are gone, and he denies it anyway. The fuckface.

Assholes don't fall far from the tree.

I'll let you know if it happens. 
@_date: 2013-06-06 17:23:10
This is exactly what I did.
@_date: 2013-06-06 02:23:44
He emptied his room and his stuff while I was at work. Left me with an empty room and his portion of the bills.

Downloaded Keepass.

Didn't know what Evilmaid was, Googled it, now I'm sure I NEVER want to live with roommates again. Fuck that.

I guess without having had a camera on him, I couldn't prove it 100% anyway. But let's say I'm 99.99999% sure. And I'm 100% sure he still owes me rent and utilities!

Truth is, I'm not even sure I'll have the money to pay the lawyer. So if he was willing to return the BTC, I would probably drop it. Doubt he'll return them though. Last I heard from him he denied everything, and moved out of the apartment while I was at work, leaving me with an empty room and his portion of the bills.

My password to get into my encrypted HD was the same password I used to get into my software wallet and several other websites and programs. My theory is that he somehow got this password by monitoring my keystrokes via Backtrack or by installing a keylogger on my computer via a link or an email he sent to me. Then he waited till I wasn't home, logged into my computer, and sent the coins to himself. It's only a theory though. Regardless of HOW he did it, **I have definitive proof via the blockchain that he, in fact, was the one who stole my coins.** Just hope that it's enough proof to hold up in court. I doubt it though. Just glad he's out of my life.

I have created a log of all the transactions that link his wallet to the stolen BTC. 
Also, I have a friend who says he will testify that the one of the payments came from his wallet; however, I'm not sure if this will help. I have never done anything like this before.
@_date: 2013-06-06 17:21:37
Unfortunately, he moved out and is not replying to my calls.
@_date: 2013-06-06 17:24:05
I might have done that except I was not skilled enough to access him computer. And it's too late now. He's gone.
@_date: 2013-06-06 02:33:14
I can't even get in touch with him anymore. Neither he nor his parents are answering my phone calls nor returning my messages.
@_date: 2013-06-06 17:22:27
Wow, that's nice of you. The beginning of a fresh start.
@_date: 2013-06-06 02:26:06
Thanks for this. Didn't want charity though, just advice. All the replies are so helpful. Especially the legal advice (because as much as I'd like to beat the shit out of him, I don't believe in resorting to violence). 
@_date: 2013-06-06 02:54:38
That's a little more than I lost. Ugh.
@_date: 2013-06-05 20:34:28
Sadly, I am the only one on the rental agreement; I signed the lease months before he moved in, and he was doing me a favor by moving in since I was screwed by another roommate. The lease is almost up, and I plan to live alone from now on. I can't deal with other people's problems anymore.
@_date: 2013-06-06 17:26:36
This is all fine in theory, but I do not feel comfortable asking others for money to handle my own problems. I didn't post this to get money -- who would do such a thing? -- I posted it as a warning. Thanks for the advice, though.
@_date: 2013-06-06 02:51:12
Because I can only remember so much. I feel like an idiot though.
