If the site disappears, you can always initialize the android wallet32 app with the keywords, which create your master private key, and access your coins.

With hierarchical deterministic wallets and the public key, you can create as many public keys as you want, but not the secret private key, which you need to spent the coins.

Implement BIP 32 and BIP 44. Best you can do for your users. Don't allow any other private keys. Instead add a feature to sweep a private key.

Well, then one BTC will become more valuable and people only trade with fractions of one BTC. The smallest fraction of a BTC is one Satoshi and 1 BTC = 100000000 Satoshi. So, there are a lot of minimum units to be traded and the fractions will get new names and be the standard trading units, like mBTC (1/1000 BTC) at the moment.

If you spend from an address, you reveal the full public key and a signature with your secret key. If you do this multiple times, you  weaken the secret key. It's like having equations with n unknown variables and revealing more and more equations with the same variables.

You can use either device. One should see what the other was doing after catching up with the blockchain.

If you (the manufacturer) store the second auth factor, and get a loaded paper, you now have both auth factors.
So, you can pay with this note and later on remove all bitcoins from that address.
@_date: 2016-10-14 14:06:22
The only way this would work, if the first auth factor would be  to covered/protected with the same mechanisms as the second.

Oh, has somebody else found the source of the sha256sum?
@_date: 2016-05-02 17:08:36
Ok, but nobody posted the source data, which gives exactly the hash he claims the sartre text is outputting.
