Yeah because fiat currency is backed by a whole lot of stuff �� 10 years in any market is still very very young... This isn’t a get rich quick scheme where you chuck a few thousand in and boom, insta millions��

Well its not a 'scam' its a open investment where you can freely remove yourself when you feel like. Everyone knows that all cryptocurrency is more unstable than nans on cocaine and its not safe to invest in as mad volatility and manipulation.

Contact support. I'm not giving you financial advice but you shouldn't depend financially on bitcoin so much. Thats like playing with fire.
