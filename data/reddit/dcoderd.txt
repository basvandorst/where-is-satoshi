My experience confirms this.

...you're weird! 
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:31:52
Good luck!

Then jump in right now.  The market is relatively low, and its open for interpretation on whether it will go up or down. (And it will probably go up at least on a yearly basis.)
@_date: 2013-05-03 14:05:10
Never heard of it.  Shrugs.

Nah, they banned kiddie porn.
@_date: 2013-06-09 18:32:39


I do, and hopefully so do you..

40+ subscribers?! That's almost 50!
(Yes, I'm just messing with you.)

We might as well go further with how do you know the compiler used doesn't install an invisible backdoor into the software?  
That type of attack would not be visible in the source of compiler either.

-1500 here. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:50:21
Yeah.  Only a hundred, which is good! I first got in with  a hundred.  Its worth 10 times that now.
He also understands that its a risk, and you have to consider that money gone until/unless you cash out.

I'll care about the price when it drops below 5, since that's when I bought in.  
But I'm not going to care until then.

Your use of "an hard" gave you a really funny accent in my head...
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:44:18
That's what I just did.  Took out around half, (completely incidental to the market) cemented my gains, and I'll probably buy while its lower than I sold at.
And I did.  I sold out at the high and bought 2/3 of the coins I cashed out with 1/3 of the money while the market is low.
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:33:30
Are you calling me weird?

Rebuilding it from the ground up would take at least a week.
Its only twelve hours, so serious maintenance probably.  They might be trying to scale their infrastructure better.  
@_date: 2013-05-14 01:36:24
What about this guy who bought at 5? =P
@_date: 2013-05-03 13:56:24
If it hits 30 I'm buying 300.
@_date: 2013-05-03 13:57:24
What holiday?
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:47:02
Same here. We win either way.
