Socialism didn't work out for Venezuela at all. 
Aaaaaaand they're adopting Bitcoin as their currency. So of course, Bitcoin is as anti-socialist as it goes.

If you challenge a group of people based on their skin color, that's racism. Also, why do you have to solve "white guys with successful careers?" Hitler tried that whole "solution" to a race thing a few years ago. Didn't work out well for him.
Or you could be sane, recognize that 63% of the US population is white, and make the determination that they'll represent a majority of the workforce. 
Its weird how majorities have the greatest influence on their land's culture, isn't it? It's also weird how folks are will fully ignorant of companies and positions ran by and held by folks of other skin colors and genders, but hey anything to push your narrative right? 
If you left Reddit occasionally to go out and socialize you'd realize that most folks are excellent to each other.

I wish more people understood this. Crypto is rocketing right now. There's a very limited amount of Bitcoin to go around and it's the one folks are talking about.

Also the Bitcoin that's lost is quite literally gone. You can't crack a wallet that doesn't exist. It's not like they're hanging out for people to break into. They're lost on old PCs that people threw out and old phones that caught fire. Like it's gone gone.

Buddy, as I told you before if you sell your Bitcoin for United States Money®, you then have to pay taxes or go to prison for unpaid taxes.

Well you should factor in the Euro, Pound, Yuan, Yen, Australian Dollarydoos,and any other first world country you can think of that are taking to BTC. 
While you're at it, factor in Venezuela and Zimbabwe who are quickly adopting crypto. Their people represent money also.

If you invested $100 when BTC was $0.33 and it gained 1%, you'd have $101. 
If you invested $100 right now when BTC is at $12,000 and it gained 1% you'd still have $101. 
You don't have to invest any more to make 1% off of Bitcoin growing 1%. 1% is always 1%.

He was on national news pimping crypto. 
National news also loves running stories exactly like this. Last year's news cycle was horrendous and had so much influence on folks. This could hurt all crypto as a whole. 
Like this needs to be an "all subs united" type thing. We don't need to archive this thread either. Like why would anyone in the crypto community want this crap getting out? It hurts our integrity as a whole.

I like games. I'll watch videos on the meta and intricacies but I won't sit down and watch videos on how to code. 
Apply that thinking to Bitcoin. OP was just asking for "bigger picture" videos that make sense to watch if you're invested. Not the technical intricacies. He's not asking to code for core, he's asking for how this works on a surface level. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:15:28
Bro he's just asking for information versus you just saying, "go do research".
Cause it sounds like to him that you haven't done it yourself. Don't just wave your hand and dismiss him, talk to him if you wanna reach him. 
Either you've done your own research and can regurgitate some talking points for him or you just set yourself up in a lie and are boasting over nothing.

@_date: 2017-12-19 01:07:50
Right, you try explaining to them that you didn't pay your taxes with your Bitcoin investments and see if they think you're "evading" or "unable to pay". (Hint, they'll pick evasion). 
Unless you've received your Bitcoin from trading goods or services then they know where your USD has gone. 
Tax evasion is a very serious (and jailable) offense. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:32:26
I told her the same thing
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:47:59
Bitcoin goes up. Bitcoin goes down. You can't explain that 
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:32:50
Except Lightning Network is a thing.

You can't eat gold and silver either, yet my country's whole economy is based on it. That's what a dollar is. "Ooh, shiny." And once you trade the shinies you receive goods. 
Same thing at play with Bitcoin only it's blinged out, ultra secure gold that can be transferred across the world quickly, safely, and easily. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:32:02

If TX fees are expensive, more folks will hop in to make money off of them. Then prices will go down. Self regulated. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:37:19
I think so, yeah.
I'm also a noob. I wonder where lightning would get it's conversion rates from?
Also won't this drive the price of LTC up?
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:51:29
But in the end, nobody including yourself truly knows wtf is going on.
Iddn't it great?
@_date: 2017-11-22 17:52:33
I'm betting that BTC is undervalued. 
21 million max, and the whole world is just beginning to wake up to it.
@_date: 2017-11-02 13:33:38
Well I'd reckon 60% of the guys in my union own an oxyacetylene rig for doing side work. They're hand portable. I'd also reckon 60% of the guys in my union have criminal backgrounds, too, lol. Tradesman are a huge part of the workforce dude. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:31:12
Welcome to buying the ATH. It's what I do because timing the market is impossible and it's worked out pretty well
@_date: 2017-11-17 11:38:31
Nah dude I want a big, loud, grunty supercharged V8. Like one in a CTS-V or a ZR-1.

Nah my dad is a pretty badass guy. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:33:59
It's odd that even though the Euro is stronger, folks really only care about the price of USD in relation. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:58:36
It's good to spend some. It's proof that the system works and it helps ground it in real value versus just being a store of wealth. 
The dollar and euro both fluctuate.

There's a lot of felons in my union, so sure why not. 
Why are you trying to change the point? All I'm getting at is cutting rigs are hand portable and plentiful. Not hard to come by. "Hey cousin lemme borrow your rig I need to attach my exhaust."

Shoo, go away. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 01:17:11
This guy lol
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:05:38
I see you have enough in BTC to afford a time machine. 
What's the ATH in the year 3000?
@_date: 2017-11-22 18:09:45
Lambos dude. It's what I'm on /s

People'd call em micros or something like that. I'm sure lingo would work 
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:32:41
It's a system that the majority of the world uses and understands, how come million and micro isn't ideal in your eyes?
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:49:51
Bro just buy. I've bought at every ATH in the last few months and I'm way over my initial investments. If you time the market you'll miss the market. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 15:40:35

To be real aren't we all kinda betting on speculation? ��
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:27:15
The name Bitcoin Cash is gonna hurt it more than anything else. Regular folk will remember hearing Bitcoin and not cash.
 If they remember hearing "cash" they'll  think Bitcoin can be pulled out in a dollar bill form. 
Then they'll be very confused and might see how BTC has exploded in the last year and might buy some. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:50:29
I'm not rich and I'm certainly not mindless, don't be a cunt.

A few hundred bucks a day you say? Look guy just because I hodl doesn't me I have that kind of money to blow
@_date: 2017-11-24 14:57:06
OP said he's got a high COL. He didn't come here for fiat advice. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:40:25
Oh hey that makes perfect sense. Perhaps I should look into the specifics.
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:53:24
Well you're still fucking early, most people in the world don't own any bitcoin.

Or buy the ATH like I tend to always do. Wahoo
@_date: 2017-11-25 19:54:46
That's not how that works dude. Different opinions doesn't automatically mark someone as a shill. Chill out and listen to what the other side has to say versus just shutting them down and putting your hands over your ears like a twelve year old.

Electric motors don't like added resistance. They'll overamp and their lifetime will be significantly reduced. It's the same effect as if the bearings began to seize up. Eventually the overcurrent roasts the dielectric on the windings and you'll get a turn to turn short. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 20:12:12
Folks are working on implementing RFID tags into goods like clothing and such that tie into the blockchain and are immutable records of authenticity. I'm not gonna shill any alts, but there are alts out there with patents on the tech and they're rolling out production currently. It's worth looking into.
I believe in a future where everything can exist in some form on the BC.
@_date: 2018-02-12 19:59:07
-Can't use it for goods that the bank deems you unable to buy, not just illegal stuff. 
-Bank lets you overdraft and charges outrageous fees
-CC transactions are expensive, crypto will be cheaper.
-You gain almost zero interest with FIAT in a checking account.

Or did we read different things?

Sure. Want my pubkey? ��

That's the confusing part for me. 
"Don't trust exchanges with your funds"
"Make sure you can trust your wallet" 
I mean as far as I go, I didn't code it so it's always gonna be a "trust a stranger" type deal either way I slice it. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 12:20:12
So you're saying we should be paying taxes when buying BTC? I thought it was just when selling for fiat or converting to alts (in the USA)?
