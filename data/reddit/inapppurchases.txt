Your fee, 5000 satoshis for 372 bytes = 13.44 sat/byte, is a bit low according to 
The site recommends 60 sat/byte for no block delay, but I've seen people posting transaction here with 40 sat/byte that got confirmed without delay.
Also, Electrum wallet's default fee is 50 sat/byte.

Hmmm. The author (whose nick is 超级君) admitted in [the comments on bikeji]( that the article is his personal view and that it is not HaoBTC's official statement. He also admitted that he didn't attend the event himself yesterday.
Apologies in advance for the low-quality translation below.
















*That said*, Aaron van Wirdum [tweeted that he got his information via an email from a major Chinese mining pool]( So maybe the Chinese mining pools did reject Bitcoin Classic??

Actually the post announcing the DDoS got orphaned from the main F2Pool thread, i.e. the link in Peter Todd's tweet is no longer the right one. 
The DDoS announcement and subsequent discussion about the DDoS can now be found under the [bitcointalk thread titled "f2pool not supporting roundtable was Re: 「魚池」..."](

What do you mean? There are already many very successful OSS, e.g. Firefox, Apache, Linux.
I don't see bitcoin's scaling issues as something that would make or break OSS.

People should really stop touting the $4 smartphone until it gets delivered. There are [media reports]( saying that the company (Ringing Bells) sent out another company's (Adcom) phone as their own prototype, and covered up the original logo with white-out. [The telecom minister has also asked for a probe into this $4 smartphone deal](

Genuine question: Bitcoin Classic has a 75% threshold on last 1000 mined blocks right? So if a fork does occur, that means majority of the hash power (&gt;=75%) is behind it. How do you get from there to an abandoned fork? As in, will you get an abandoned fork if hashing power falls below 75% during the 28-day grace period? 
If what Samson Mow means by "abandoned fork" is that Bitcoin Classic never gets 75% support to begin with, that doesn't quite make sense to me. Because if there is less than 75% support, it seems like there won't even be a fork and that a Classic node would be no different from a Core node in that case.
Please correct me if I'm wrong.

Some OSS deal with database scaling, some does not. I was not comparing the difficulty of the different problems.
I still don't see how bitcoin scaling is something that'd make or break OSS ecosystem.
To elaborate, I read "Scaling Bitcoin will be the ultimate test of OSS" to mean "if we can't figure out how to scale bitcoin, then OSS will have failed". Perhaps I'm misunderstanding what you're trying to say?

To be pedantic, the quote is from a December 2013 Chicago Fed Letter titled "Bitcoin: A primer" written by François R. Velde, senior economist (not chairman) of Federal Reserve in Chicago ([PDF link](


some of the enthusiasm for bitcoin is
driven by a distrust of state-issued currency,
it is hard to imagine a world where
the main currency is based on an extremely
complex code understood by
only a few and controlled by even fewer,
without accountability, arbitration,
or recourse

What would happen if a new block does include transactions already confirmed in the previous block? Would the new block be invalid?
Also, I read somewhere that the main reason for mining zero-transaction block is that zero-transaction blocks has lower propagation delay than blocks filled with transactions thus reducing the risk of orphaning. What do you think about that theory?
Looking at the blocks, it seems like miners get at most 2% of current block reward in transaction fees (most are less than that) so miners who do zero-transaction blocks don't seem to miss out much.
