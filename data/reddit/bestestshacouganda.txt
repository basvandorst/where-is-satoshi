This author is already in Bitcoin Orbituaries don't worry.
Cya at zero buddy, don't whine that you got scamed then.
@_date: 2018-04-10 10:11:41
Exactly. 2011. When less than 1% of the public knew about it.

Log chart is 50 times worse actually.

And they fell for the bull trap... Every time it's the same.
Soon I won't even be able to post here, my karma dropping as fast as my account grows XD
Guess I'll have to make an offical reddit account linked to my trading view acc anyway.
Spreading the truth for those that want to hear it here:

And this is why all the "HODLers" from the top will lose their money. Cringe.
People are so dumb.
When NO ONE knows about BTC call it a scam don't buy say it will fail fall to 0. Every idiot says it won't go anywhere even thought it has a use.
Waves 1 2 3. At the end of the last wave the public hears about it and jumps in. Everyone on the planet heard about BTC.
Every idiot says "Bitcoin will go to 1 million".
And they HODL.
Except after the 3rd big wave up and when the public joined, that's when you get the huge correction and 90% of a market dies and never recovers.
Was like this with internet. Top stocks never recovered.
Was like this before with all kinds of stocks, has always worked this way, and it's not about to change.
Just so cringy how people manage to fail to buy when something will go up and start holding when it won't go up anymore.

If I'm so dumb how come I've been right in every single of my last predictions on Bitcoin? Luck? XD
I heard all these companies were doing great:
AOL, Cisco (Giants at the very top, just like BTC), Startup.com, Friendsters, gov.works, Napster, Pets.com, 
kozmo.com, geocities, boo.com, webvan, Silicon Access, eToys.com, Fast-Chip, theglobe.com, Lexra, 
IP Semiconductors, Dr.Koop, Entridia, lastminute.com, Stargate Solutions, Netargy, Hywire, Teradiant, FastChip, Excite,
jewishnet.co.uk, Acorn Networks, freeinternet.com.
If you joined at the top once the public heard about BTC and all rushed in to buy great job! We won't crash don't worry! Another public from another planet will join 100% You're an early adopter!

Funny you'd say that... Published this months ago...
But Bitcoin fits the bubble description, it doesn't matter if it's pokemon cards being traded for a few grans or a multi trillion market, the definition talks about price action.
I only care about the facts, not the "emotion" that comes with the word bubble.
@_date: 2018-04-14 21:29:39
Semantics... The definition of a bubble I read is "go up too fast in price when the public gets excited, in an unsustainable manner, and then goes down alot, 90% or more."
@_date: 2018-04-10 09:35:32
The herd was pessimistic 6 years ago.
And today, the herd that waited for the top to buy is over-optimistic.
Crypto crashing better believe me. It's going to end very badly for alot of people.
Call me an idiot please, so I can screenshot this in a year :D
@_date: 2018-04-10 11:06:25
Lol just did. Did Microsoft actually underperform inflation? XD
60$ ath in 2000 and today at 90.
Imagine a crap bank that give 1% a year. 60 * 1.01^18 = 71.76.
Well at least you'd get more money compared to a 1% bank.
Breaks even with 2% a year.
Imaging having your capital locked up 20 years to basically break even :D
I don't get why people will never learn. They're hoping they get lucky? Sure there's a tiny chance, but why not just play lottery then? Better odds better reward.
People persuaded BTC can't go up when no one even knows about it, and then people persuaded it will go up after it gets global mainstream media coverage and the whole planet knows about it because "last time they said it wouldn't go up". Logic...

Reality going to hit you hard :)
@_date: 2018-04-14 23:10:54
I'm not your average moron.
People were blindly buying in November-December, the FOMO was unreal. Still many people are convinced they'll get rich no matter what.

How is your crypto portfolio from 8 months ago?
Your comments did not age very well I must say :D
@_date: 2018-12-15 11:42:32
I got banned and insulted 1 year ago when I said the price would go down...
