They can’t ALL be useless garbage, surely?

Beat it again!

The people that bought in at 10k would be my guess
@_date: 2018-02-21 00:43:17
How could you possibly say that with such certainty? Sounds a bit naive to me

Don’t FOMO in, wait til everyone is panicking. Then buy.

I guess, depending on the time scales you’re looking at, in crypto terms it could be considered sideways

I bought at 10.2k and 9k. I don’t want to put any more in, but if I did I would wait for sub 8k (even though this might take weeks/months and there’s a chance it may never happen although personally I think that’s unlikely)

What’s a DMA?
@_date: 2018-02-21 00:32:02
Depends if you’re short or long

Sounds like you’ve got your tactics down! To the... moon? What’s the opposite of moon?
@_date: 2018-02-21 00:39:21
Ok cool. Got that. So the 50 day average is crossing the 100 day average?
@_date: 2018-02-21 00:49:58
Is this something people often look at when trading? Not really seen people talking about averages over these kind of time periods before for crypto

What is ‘big’? I’m fairly confident if you wait a while you’ll be able to sell at a profit. Don’t panic sell, that would be the worst
Edit: ‘a while’ could be several months to a year

In terms of their BTC value or their USD value?

To the core!
