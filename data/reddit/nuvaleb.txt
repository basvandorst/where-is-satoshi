There are so many things I'd get before a sports car. I'd probably just stick with my VW Jetta even if I had &gt;10M in my bank account.

My 8000CAD (6400USD) buy order just went through. Wow.

Why do you need two exchanges, 2 buy orders, and 2 sell orders?

Quadriga, it's the only place to trade with canadian dollar. I'm now strongly considering doing the bulk of my trading on bitstamp (for crytpo to fiat) or binance for alts. 
When you say "trade alts", do you mean alt-alt or alt-BTC?

The fees for crypto/crypto are 0.25%, the fees for crytpo/fiat are 0.5%. I've been aiming for 1.5%, so that should still leave me with 0.5%. 
The math all makes sense when I look at the transactions. It should work in theory, but it always seem that my profit gets eaten away by having some amount on the wrong side of a longer term bull/bear.

I predict it's going to go back up to about 7400 USD this morning as America wakes up, then back down to 5500 by later tonight as China wakes up. 
If I was hodling at the moment, I'd put sell orders at 7100, 7150, 7200, 7250, 7300, and 7350.

You're absolutely right, and that's why I called it a prediction.

The MACD and RSI are indicators that show you momentum. 
The MACD takes two moving averages (for example, one with 12 periods, one with 26 periods) and checks the difference. The difference is called the MACD line. In a sense, this is like a taking the first derivative. Then, another moving average of the MACD line is taken, this one is called the signal line. 
A moving average of the MACD line is taken (i.e. 9 periods) and we call this the signal line. 
Usually, we plot the difference between the MACD line and the signal line as a histogram. This is sort of like taking the derivative of the MACD. 
So if we were to think of the market price as the position of an object, the MACD line would be related to the object's velocity, the histogram would be related to the object's acceleration. 
When you want to swing trade, you want to buy when the price is at a low point. The low point happens when the "velocity" (MACD) is going from negative to positive. However, because the moving averages are taken only with past data (don't know the future data), the "velocity" and "acceleration" are delayed. So by the time you know your velocity is changing, you've already missed the low point (usually by quite a bit). 
So lets say we look at the "acceleration" plot (histogram) instead. When it crosses from negative to positive, that means that the velocity is increasing (that doesn't mean the velocity is positive, it just means it's getting less negative). So the histogram lets us know a bit sooner when the low point is happening. Even then though, you usually still miss the lowest point. However, although you missed the lowest point, you have pretty high confidence that you'll be buying at a pretty good point (but it's the price you pay for the added confidence in your trade). 
As for divergence... the MACD and RSI are measures of momentum, but they tend to follow the same shapes as the price. If you look at two separate recent dips and you see the most recent dip is lower than the one before, but you see something different in the MACD line and RSI (i.e. the most recent dip is higher then the one before), it can be a sign that the price has dipped more than it really should have, so it might be a good time to buy, it has a pretty decent chance of going up. This scenario is called a bullish divergence.

Looking at my S&amp;P500 ETF (XUS.TO), there is a significant bullish divergence in the MACD and RSI (I used a 1 hour chart), volume is pretty decent, so it's looking like it might hit a low point soon and turn around (at the very least, day traders can get in early enough on a bulltrap to make a bit of profit).

Yep, I'm on QuadrigaCX.

In canada you can only exchange crypto to crypto I think.

My 7680 USD buy order hit early this morning, but it was a small order, 0.01 BTC or so. I've got 0.01BTC buy orders set up for the next several 500 USD price decrements.

I'm just hoping for a small bounce back to 7500 or so before a good drop, I'm hoping to 5500 or so in the next couple of days.

What's your technique?
