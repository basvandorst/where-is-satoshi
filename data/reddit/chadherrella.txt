with any investment that involves trading...you just definitely familiarize yourself with the charts and indicators like RSI.  use these tools to buy and sell.  With bitcoin, DCA and long term investing is a good plan.  Then set your stop limit to sell all at the blow off top.  then wait a year when btc drops 83% and start buying again.

Keep this in mind.  You are  no longer a customer of a bank.  You are now a bank owner.  You should google internet security policies and responsibilities of employees and staff of a bank
Like if you were actually working at a bank, no personal devices can be used to make bank transactions or used for any other bank purposes --&gt; have a dedicated device for your BTC transactions.  Device should only be connected to internet for transaction purposes only.  You can use inexpensive android phones.  I use mycelium on an android phone which allows me to connect my keepkey or nano wallet.  I don't use the phone for any other purpose but bitcoin transactions.
This will keep your BTC safe

follow the RSI on the weekly, daily, 4h, and hourly...BUY BTC when RSI on any chart drops below 30.
when all charts have RSI above 70 and the monthly RSI touches 100, sell all.  wait for the 83% drop.

what are you talking about a different story? the summary of the article is similar to my analysis....albeit with all the calculations done in the article you posted, there is no target for the next peak.

after every halving the btc price would peak, after 11/28/2012, btc price peaked 10k% then dropped 83%, after the 2nd halving on 7/9/2016, btc price peaked 2.9k% to $20k and dropped 83% to $3k.  If the BTC follows these moves for the next halving on 5/20/2020....it could peak at around 840% to $97k and drop 83% to $16k.
