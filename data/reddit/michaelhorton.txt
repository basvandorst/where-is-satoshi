Btc is kind of terrible to make a quick value transfer. I prefer ether or ltc for that purpose. 
@_date: 2016-08-11 17:37:45
I think we just need to start admitting that using bitcoin as a payment rail is just not dependable enough.  Lightening network can't get here fast enough.
@_date: 2016-08-09 22:01:14
Funny, you didn't quote that in your OP.

So sick of the FUD on this subreddit.  I've never had an issue with coinbase with buying/selling/moving btc.  
@_date: 2016-08-03 16:35:42
Not really comparable.  BTC value from the Mt Gox era was massively inflated from the willybot.

Lol, yeah that's why I'm so interested in a decentralized currency, so I can depend on centralized powers to help people out.
@_date: 2016-08-01 23:56:01
1/ You're safe leaving your btc on coinbase
2/ If you don't want to leave it there, then you should create a wallet where you have the keys using anyone of a number of options.
@_date: 2016-08-10 05:06:28

Misread your comment, thought you were saying that from the perspective of a viewer, not a video creator.  Sorry.
@_date: 2016-04-28 14:45:40
That is false.  I just used a wallet that was not coinbase and it worked fine.

CHAPTER 4: CONCLUSION 
In the Committee’s view, it is the case that legislators, governments, central banks, private-sector entities in a range of sectors, customers, merchants, investors and others are considering the opportunities and challenges that digital currencies present. 
After hearing from a broad range of witnesses in Ottawa, and traveling to New York City for a factfinding trip, the Committee has concluded that digital currencies and their technologies present a variety of opportunities. In the Committee’s view, it is likely that the innovation underlying these currencies and technologies has applications that have not yet been imagined. There is evidence that they reduce transaction costs, increase the choices available to customers and merchants, protect users’ identities and record all transactions. A key focus, then, is the actions that the federal government and other entities could take to maximize those opportunities. 
Equally, the Committee acknowledges that digital currencies and their technologies present a range of challenges. Money laundering, terrorist financing, losses due to cyber-theft, bankruptcy of digital currency exchanges, price volatility, and a range of taxation issues are serious obstacles for a government whose primary duty is to protect its citizens. 
Therefore, the Committee strongly believes that a balanced regulatory approach is needed in the digital currency sector. On one hand, the Committee is mindful that the government has the responsibility to protect consumers and root out illegal activity. On the other hand, it is critical that government action does not stifle innovation in digital currencies and its associated technologies that are in an early and delicate stage of development. 
Having completed the study, the Committee is of the opinion that the opportunities presented by digital currencies, technologies and businesses outweigh the challenges. The Committee is confident that the implementation of our recommendations will have positive outcomes for consumers, merchants, digital currency-related businesses, Canada’s financial services sector and others. The Committee looks forward to timely government action designed to maximize the opportunities and manage the challenges facing the digital currency sector

With just the password, i could change the bitcoin address on your profile to a wallet I controlled.  2fa would be nice to prevent this.
@_date: 2014-07-22 14:58:47
I'm not sure I agree we need to be in a rush to get bitcoin to mass adoption quite yet.  There aren't the exchanges to handle the volume the author is looking for, and the protocol still needs refinement with the on-chain transaction limit.
I really wish I could use bitcoin(where I live) for my standard expenses:
-groceries (I don't shop at wholefoods)
-restaurants (I don't live in SF or NYC)
-sporting events
-bills(don't have dish)

At this time, that doesn't seem like much incentive.

@_date: 2014-08-12 23:40:00
A lot of the information is true.  As I was reading it I was thinking to myself it's not the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's job to sell consumers on why bitcoin is a good idea.  I'm just hopeful they have the same kind of material for ETFs, Gold, REITs, and other investment vehicles.  
@_date: 2014-10-21 14:26:47
The comments here kind of suck.  OP makes a good point about the need for a better way for making physical bitcoin payments as they related to apple pay.  You don't have to be an apple fanboy to see that their implementation is pretty solid.  User adoption of bitcoin might be higher if we had something as easy at apple pay.
@_date: 2014-04-17 14:22:30
Of course haters of alt coins are gong to hate cryptsy.  I've never had a problem with their exchange btw.

I'm tired of seeing this headline.  The answer is simple.  The question you should be asking:
Why is there so little consumer demand for bitcoin?

I wish Erik(and others who are being interviewed by the MSM) would call out these journalists for there stupid questions.  
"Why blame regulators who could of saved you?"
"How could they(tech entrepreneurs) be trusted to regulate something like bitcoin, or prop of the currency?"

@_date: 2014-09-18 21:28:13
Exactly this.  I see no way that mass adoption is anywhere near.  Bitcoin being used for "tipping" or micropayments would help get us there but I don't see that coming anytime soon either.
@_date: 2014-02-20 18:29:15

I have to say, it's pretty damn incredible that a government official is reaching out to the reddit community for feedback on this.  As much as some seem to hate all things government, I think what Mr. Lawsky is doing should be a model for other government officials.

Is that you "audiophiliacwoodworker"?
"Oh I don’t know.. Maybe it has something to do with it being started online by some anonymous online personality and it’s value is based on some anonymous online marketplace, and has already shown that the value can be easily swayed by some anonymous economic forces. It’s apparently easily hacked. 
I would think anyone with any common sense would be a little wary of it. Especially someone who’s been around and seen a few con games played out. Mind you, it appears custom made to appeal to those people anxious to try out the latest fad, to jump on the newest thing.. Good luck with that."
"There is no comparison between Bitcoin and the internet. I've seen some try to relate Bitcoin to PayPal. PayPal is based on the transfer of actual currency. Not some Monopoly money whose fluctuating value is out of your control and determined by some mysterious force..
You're free to do as you wish, but no one with any sense would have anything to do with it. "
@_date: 2014-09-17 20:52:24
WTF?  I own bitcoin and am a supporter.  I'm just saying that your average person who lives in the first world isn't going to see the value of it right now.  If they could buy gas and groceries, if they've been a ID theft victim, or if they hate the FED then I could see them going for it.  So when you don't have any sort of demand for a product, or course the price is going to fall. 
@_date: 2014-08-29 16:35:37

I'm an idiot.  I read the headline as "Why is the price continuing to drop?" not "Why the price will continue to drop".

@_date: 2014-10-09 14:26:03
I've had only one issue with coinbase(after heardbleed by 2fa stopped working) and I was able to get it resolved via chat in less than 2 minutes. I have had zero issue using newegg, circle, overstock, dell, gyft, or any other bitcoin relating/accepting company.
My point was if you have an issue with a company, take it to the company.  It seems like every other post on this forum is a complaint about a bitcoin company.  I have a feeling some of these are fud, and some of these are folks who aren't going starting off their complaint with the company in question.  It's like twitter has conditioned some that it's easier to broadcast your concerns publicly rather than start off doing them privately.

@_date: 2014-10-13 14:32:43
I'm using this now, and it works greats.  Using it with my coinbase account and I've only had one vendor have a problem with it.  I'm surprised coinbase/circle don't issue debit cards like this.
@_date: 2015-05-21 19:40:30
Well, he actually hasn't done anything yet but talk.  No regulations have gone into in relation to virtual currencies.  
@_date: 2014-07-18 20:13:34
I don't think retailer adoption should be a priority, I think new user adoption should be.  We need more people getting into and staying in the ecosystem.  Most of the retailers(except overstock) that accept btc are jumping back into fiat which I don't think helps btc long term.  Don't get me wrong, we have to start somewhere.

I think Judie Rinearson and Fred Wilson have emerged as the stars from the NYDFS hearing.
@_date: 2014-07-31 15:27:05
I've been following bitcoin fairly closely for 9 months and I had never heard if this bug. 
@_date: 2016-01-12 21:11:40
No, it's up and running fine.
@_date: 2016-03-22 23:40:19


Lol, yeah it's the bitlicense hurting btc and not the uncertainty of the blocksize.
@_date: 2016-01-12 21:11:56
No, it's up and running fine.

This video is from 2014....
@_date: 2016-03-23 03:21:55
You're right, I'm certain it will never get figured out.  1mb for life! 
@_date: 2014-12-03 19:19:41
I've never received bitcoin via changetip.  Would love to see how it works.
@_date: 2016-03-01 03:52:31
It won't. Competition will develop and eat it's lunch. 
@_date: 2016-06-15 16:09:37
No problem on my end.  Just made a purchase this morning.
@_date: 2016-06-30 14:44:00
I would think in the future, merchants would change the pricing for those paying in BTC since settlement takes place so fast and there's no chance of chargebacks.  
@_date: 2016-06-16 15:39:54
The guy thought we'd be in a 300-500 channel for a couple of years back in 2014.  He also stated that we were ready for a big breakout earlier this year.  I value his opinion more than some random on the webernets.
@_date: 2016-06-29 23:30:51
I've had two transactions take over 6 hours using the default fee.  
@_date: 2016-06-15 19:04:09
I'd say a vefified coinbase account.
@_date: 2016-06-17 22:59:47
Kind of like a court forcing apple to create code to decrypt an iPhone. 
@_date: 2016-06-14 21:34:33
It's expected to take place in the next 26 days.
Check this out if you want to read up on the upcoming halvening and potential price impact:
@_date: 2016-06-15 19:28:50
I agree, although many were told that bitcoin was great because it allowed for super cheap transactions.  So cheap it would allow for microtransactions.  
@_date: 2016-06-15 19:02:12
I think it's a great thought and coinbase is a great site to purchase bitcoins.  You may want to get a wallet where you control the keys to transfer the coins you get from coinbase.
@_date: 2016-06-15 15:05:59
It sure is a flaw if mass adoption is a goal.  That's what I'd like to see, many here dgaf.
@_date: 2016-06-03 17:23:21
Been using coinbase for years, still have no complaints.  
@_date: 2016-06-14 23:51:37
Don't worry, the lightening network will be here someday to help you out.
@_date: 2016-06-17 22:58:26
If I can be done at all, why trust it?  Kind of like why trust that btc network if a 51% attack can take place. 
@_date: 2016-06-03 17:25:53
Yep, just some BS FUD
@_date: 2016-06-06 22:37:29
Yes, it should go up quite a bit in the next 12 months.  Or maybe it won't.
@_date: 2016-06-14 19:35:01
Coinbase.  Many project we will be choppy around the 600-700 price point for the next few weeks(maybe months), although a rise is expected after the halvening.
@_date: 2016-06-23 23:36:02
Are blocks being increased to 2MB this year?
@_date: 2016-06-14 23:47:57
Lol, coinbase it just fine.  People on this sub seem to hate them because they have embraced ethereum on their exchange and they're the biggest player in town in the USA.
@_date: 2016-06-06 16:17:29
I think this is the wrong place to expect a objective review of anything coinbase related.
@_date: 2016-06-30 17:14:54
Ok, well people should stop making it then.  That and cheap remittence.  There's not thing cheap about it when you have to convert back to fiat since barely any merchants accept btc.  
BTC = Digital Gold and it's censorship resistant are it's only selling points.  Everything else is just bullshit to try to create demand for adoption.
@_date: 2016-06-14 05:58:24
Yep, and he also predicted a price of 300-500 as a medium term price back in 2014. 
@_date: 2016-06-21 19:06:01
The obsession with the dao in this sub is hilarious.

Been using coinbase for years, still works fine for me.  
@_date: 2016-06-30 14:40:36


In the past, there were many people making this argument.  Many of us knew that miners would need to get paid by the fees in the future, but while the block reward were so high many thought the very low fees would continue into the near future.
@_date: 2016-06-03 20:18:41
This whole thread is loltastic.  If you don't like coinbase, then don't use them.  If they're the next MTGOX, then they'll go bankrupt and be left in the dust.  The free market will help determine winners and losers, not propaganda.
@_date: 2016-06-15 19:03:12
Hopefully a solution to this comes about soon.  Any solution.
@_date: 2016-06-29 05:19:08
Lol, the future of money my ass.
@_date: 2015-08-03 18:40:23
Since tx fees will pay for the security of the network in the future, fees will need to go up or the buying power of bitcoin will need to rise
@_date: 2015-08-19 21:02:22
still dropping.
@_date: 2015-08-04 20:58:55
This seems kind of dumb and pointless.  It takes away from the value of this subreddit.

Wow, good stuff.  Very brave of him to talk about this.
@_date: 2015-08-19 00:36:36
lol, this had nothing to do with xt.
@_date: 2015-08-20 01:00:57
Lol, xt was developed by non phds so it must be bad.
@_date: 2015-08-14 15:23:39
Just went through the process of buying the MP3 and it was super easy.  Who needs a distributor at this point?
@_date: 2015-08-05 20:47:57
So is a bitlicense.  That doesn't mean we should support it.
@_date: 2015-08-17 18:21:48
It's perfect if you're lazy and don't want to deal with exchanges to move from one crypto to another.
@_date: 2015-08-20 23:27:57
I've gone through this process and it was painless, although a bit complicated for the normal end user.  
@_date: 2015-08-27 20:18:55
I'm sick of seeing an actual coin representing a digital currency.

Damn, guess I won't get back my two minutes after reading that garbage.

17 days is a terribly small sample size.
@_date: 2015-08-14 20:57:49
Bitlicense = perceived legitimacy
I'm guess that will somehow help with more investment in both the token as well as related businesses.  We'll see who wins, Texas vs NY

The site is up for me.
@_date: 2015-07-31 21:25:28
I'm not if I'm reading right, but is FNY making 3% on 5 million with 0 risk?  Where can I sign up for a deal like that?
@_date: 2015-07-27 16:26:43
From early in the article...
"Peter Schiff, Robert Kiyosaki, Bill O’Reilly, and other noted experts"
I stopped reading after that line.

Not really, they can move to onboarding people from fiat to another cryto-currency. 
@_date: 2016-02-11 15:44:10
Lol at calling an FU tweet criticism.  
@_date: 2016-02-16 18:43:22
To stay in the news.
@_date: 2015-07-30 17:39:19
If everything is true on his wiki page, he really doesn't have much credibility imo.
Religion is primary. Unless a culture is aspiring toward the good, the true, and the beautiful, and wants the good and the true, really worships God, it readily worships Satan. If we turn away from God, our culture becomes dominated by "Real Crime Stories" and rap music and other spew
@_date: 2015-07-27 19:45:01
yep, that's me!
@_date: 2016-02-08 17:38:51
I know links have been posted in the past for Louis CK accepting BTC, but it still blows my mind that arguably the current best stand up comedian is selling his content directly to consumers for btc.  How aren't all artists doing this right now???
@_date: 2016-02-22 18:46:58
My thinking is they'll move on from BTC if classic(or something like it) doesn't take hold.  They are in the onboarding and transaction game.
@_date: 2015-07-13 21:47:10
Vinny really gets it.
@_date: 2016-02-08 19:14:59


I disagree.  I like being able to make a push payment on the internet and bitpay allows for that.
I agree things need to get better, but you seem very down on this.   
@_date: 2016-02-12 06:58:31
More content?  Is he going to string together a sentence?
@_date: 2016-02-08 18:33:08
Fair point.  I do think it's a no brainer though for artists to setup a mechanism(bitpay) that allows fans to purchase direct via btc.
@_date: 2016-09-07 20:04:09
WTF, when is this shit going to be announced.  Bored now listening to story about banks.
@_date: 2016-09-23 17:14:52
Golly, coinbase is the worst.  I must be super lucky to never have had an issue with them for over 3 years.
@_date: 2016-09-02 02:39:12
Gotta love throwing money away on a system that is completely broken.
@_date: 2016-02-09 15:57:19
Literally no confirmation.  Lol.
@_date: 2016-09-26 19:22:37
That stinks.  I've yet to have an issue with coinbase, hope you get yours resolved.  
@_date: 2016-09-22 21:19:37
Lolwat?  California sucks I guess.  I opened my business bank account in 20 minutes.

Way to cut the quote off short....
@_date: 2015-09-25 20:35:19
1) Double wrong, it competes with other payment platforms for investment
2) Double wrong, resiliency == a minority of stubborn individuals impending progress.  
@_date: 2015-09-02 21:47:53
I know some are going to hate this, but I see this as good news.  Those that repped the status quo continue to peel off and join BTC startups.
@_date: 2015-09-15 22:50:45
over 90%
@_date: 2015-09-25 19:56:55
1) The fact that the blockchain can't support transactions on par with other payment platforms is going to stop major investment and adoption.
2) The inefficiency in the process to get anything changed in protocal will also stop major investment and adoption.
@_date: 2015-09-01 17:49:11
Newflash:  Government agents are people and some people steal.  Greed motivates.  I don't give a shit about these stories.  This is why we need to move to trustless(less human involved) systems.
@_date: 2015-09-02 21:41:48
I tried to go through the process and it wasn't really that easy to purchase btc credits via backpage/paxful.  I'm fairly good with computer(blah blah blah, I'm a sysadmin, blah) but I could see a few pain points in the process.  BTC is pretty far from ready for primetime, but I'm very hopeful it's just a matter of time.  
It would be pretty sweet if you could just buy btc via circle(coinbase) and a credit card but do the whole transaction in the backpage website.
@_date: 2015-11-06 21:05:07
Coinbase and circle allow for instant purchase with a confirmed account.  If you don't have one of those, you could try and find a btc ATM or use localbitcoins.
@_date: 2015-03-27 18:21:08

85btc!  Lol.  I'm hoping things pick up soon.
@_date: 2016-05-25 15:17:24
Figure out if btc will be digital gold or a visa/mastercard replacement.
@_date: 2016-05-30 06:22:40
Exactly, people seem to miss this point. They are trying to make me money off all cyrtpo transactions. 
@_date: 2016-05-25 15:18:24
This article is hot garbage.
@_date: 2016-05-11 18:43:00

Good questions that will probably never be answered.  Oh well.
@_date: 2015-10-06 23:40:07
This sub has really gone downhill.  Didn't know this was a personal blog platform now.
@_date: 2016-05-25 17:11:17
I assume op is trying to make the point that most thought btc would never be as low as $450 again.

@_date: 2016-05-03 19:38:21

@_date: 2016-05-17 18:45:06
It's really quite incredible how easy it is to buy digital goods with btc.  It should be the standard.
@_date: 2016-07-26 20:47:50
Why the fuck is a trolling comment on twitter about some alt shit coin exchange relevant on this sub?  I feel all of this has become a great distraction for the stagnate price of btc, and stagnate nature of BTC development.  
@_date: 2016-07-27 14:33:26
Pretty standard for their operation.  Not sure why people use their services anymore.
@_date: 2016-07-19 15:03:22
