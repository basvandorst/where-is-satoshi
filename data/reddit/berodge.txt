cool. I had read that that was in the making and hoped it would be the case.  I guess I could have just checked the updates myself but I it's good to be social sometimes...

nice!  it really is well designed and simple. soooo much better looking than green address... I can't stand how GA splits addresses into multiple lines to fit them on the screen

I've talked with the admins at [nitrogensports.eu]( about a line on the elections.  No definitive answer yet but for folks looking for a bitcoin casino (mainly sports betting and poker) nitrogen is awesome. instant withdrawals, no fees, nice lines.

it actually is fairly common.  [nitrogensports.eu]( has a fairly large community that is active in their chat 24/7.  it's really fun over there!

definitely [nitrogensports.eu]( I've used all of the Bitcoin casinos and a few different fiat options and my experience with nitro has been flawless.  like other have mentioned, instant withdrawal with no fees is quite possibly the greatest thing in the world.  awesome community of entertaining personalities in there chat too...

[nitrogensports.eu]( for all your sports betting needs.

yes I am.
edit: didnt mean to sound that smug... that is what I'm saying rhough. I know you can get your credit/debit card limit increased. you may be able to do the same with bank xfer but I'm unsure

just to be clear, you aren't looking at the $2500 weekly limit for bank transfer on coinbase right? that will apply to any bank.

i stopped using cloudbet for this reason and a few other tech issues.  Always emailed support right away.  Would receive automated response within minutes and an actual human response within 1-2 days.  FWIW i never had a problem go unresolved but some took upwards of 2-3 days.  I switched to [nitrogensports.eu]( just under a year ago and have had ZERO issues.  I do occasionally log onto cloudbet to make a livebet to cover a loss but as nitrogen ads more and more livebetting options this has become a non issue.  Be patient with cloudbet and i'd expect the issue will be resolved.  After that, come check out nitrogen, great community over there too!
