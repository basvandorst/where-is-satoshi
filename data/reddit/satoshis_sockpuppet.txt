One of these claims is true and at the same time completely unnecessary and was never a problem to solve until some people discovered it as an attack vector.
Find out which one.
Read The Fucking Whitepaper.

So if I beat on a lump of earth the whole day, the lump of earth is worth the energy I put into the beating? 
The comparison with the dollar gives people a quick impressions how much they can buy with a Bitcoin (Value), your metric says nothing.

It's nice to have but not necessary and definitely not as a soft fork hack.

If we get a rally, not when ;)
And I see a rally somewhat problematic at the current situation.

BitFury is the perfect example for "Pride comes before the fall".

They don't say it's necessary. And Gavin and Jeff definitely don't agree with deploying it as a hack / soft fork.

"Can't be evil" wasn't enough to show how good all you people are?
Come up with some concrete statements and stop giving generic statements.
@_date: 2016-03-26 19:29:35
Which is exactly the point. If many new people were interested in Bitcoin we certainly would not see declining traffic for bitcoin.org. It doesn't matter if it is a bad website or non informative. Some of the people coming in would end up there regardless. 
@_date: 2016-03-26 19:33:08
So you didn't understand the chart. The chart exactly expresses, that bitcoins value is probably dependent on it's use.
As soon as we got into "full blocks" water the price stopped rising. 
It doesn't say: Bitcoin *is* more valuable.
It says Bitcoin *could* be more valuable.

Did you forget the /s ?

And they will probably come to the conclusion that it isn't allowed to grow and thus will use other options available.

Funny. I did five wire transfers yesterday and I didn't have a problem. Logged into my online banking account, filled out the forms (Iban, recipient, amount, subject), got my mobile tan and tada - finished. Zero fee, no problems at all. Took me about 10 minutes for 5 transfers.
I don't see any ass kicking coming. Except the other way around maybe.

Thanks for the warm welcome!

So I'm not going to say that bitcoin is doomed or whatever but imho you have a way to positive, reality denying view. And a disclaimer: I don't think any of the altcoins, especially Et****** are better.


Examples for improving the protocol?
Segwit isn't ready and when it is ready it is in question if it will activitate. Furthermore, it takes a lot of change in wallets etc. to have any impact.
2 MB blocks are coming at the earliest next year and even this isn't sure anymore. Another year of stagnation..


Why does that make bitcoin stronger? In the worst case it could make bitcoin weaker as the hashrate abruptly declines.


Let's hope so.


They are "instantly boosting bitcoins capabilities" for years now without existing...
I don't see lightning in work anywhere.


And none of them is using Bitcoin.
P.S.: The traffic for bitcoin.com and bitcoin.org as well as the bitcoin related posting frequency on reddit is declining.
And the number of bitcoin transactions isn't growing anymore.
@_date: 2016-03-26 16:52:05
I'll have to dig a little but there was some data from reddit, that posting frequency on and is declining the last weeks as well as posts containing "bitcoin".
The sites might not be very popular but it is an indicator for declining interest if their views are going down. bitcoin.org is still one of the first pages if you search for bitcoin so if we had growing interest we would definitely see more views.

You know as well as any bitcoiner that there are kids in their early twenties who got too rich to quick with bitcoin. Ahem.
@_date: 2016-02-26 09:38:22
Have you ever heard of something called "Bitcoin"? You can use it to pay for goods and services.
@_date: 2016-02-24 15:32:48
Oh yeah you have to remember that everyday. They can't be evil!
Just like Google! Because THEY SAID THEY WON'T!!!
@_date: 2016-02-27 14:20:34
So the transactions are done on- or offchain?
@_date: 2016-02-24 17:16:12
So, if Adam asked "officially" to change that title to "individual", why didn't they leave it that way and Adam gave F2Pool the explanation you are giving here?
Protip: Next time put a hash of the "official document" into the blockchain. We've seen the title go from president of bs to individual back to president of bs. This isn't inspiring confidence.
@_date: 2016-02-26 09:00:51
I can't see any side profiting from that.
Seems like wasted money, whatever side you are supporting. If it's misguided core supporters or a false flag operation to gain some kind of "pity support", it's just wasted money.
