Yes, they panic sold hard, but now they are slowing down (just around $10 USD below as selling pressure, from $30 plus below yesterday).
So either they don't have many coins left to sell or they are hodling. Weak hands were shaken, then shorts were squeezed, and that's good.

That depends on your needs, you can start to cash out a little bit now if you need the money and buy back later, or wait until it hits $2,000 (maybe by this year's end) or $5000 and sell more IF you need the money, and then keep buying all the way up (cost-averaging) when you spend it... and so on. All the way to the moon (maybe a million dollars per bitcoin?) then you would spend only satoshis.

Why better internet protocols didn't replace the current internet protocol? Because its network effect, it was so hard to change even since early on. That's why the main bitcoin attribute is immutability.

No, most trade is done in USD. The 90% China myth was busted when PoBC prohibited them from doing margin trading and zero fees, since then the fake volumes collapsed 90% to the now real volume.

Gemini.com or Coinbase.com are fully licensed and regulated by the US Government and Agencies, they comply with all KYC/AML laws and regulations.
Coinbase Vault is very safe for storage, they store &gt;99% of bitcoins offline on cold storage, so they can't be hacked/stolen. If you are not tech savvy (like &gt;99% of world population) it's much more probable that you end up losing them (for many reasons) if you store them yourself.

@_date: 2017-01-12 13:28:23
Correct, Chinese panic is dissolving little by little, there was no crack down on bitcoin exchanges and nothing bad happened in reality. The Chinese government inspections will result in a perception of bitcoin legitimization/approval at the end. Chinese are still panic-selling due to those government inspections (that's why for the first time in years you see $30 cheaper price in China), but there is a hard bottom at $750, where the rest of the world (USA, Europe, India, etc) are scooping up those cheap coins. This is good for long-term sustainability, decreased volatility and coins more equitable worldwide distribution. This is a great point in time to get one bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-01-07 00:43:32
Real estate prices will probably plummet when the housing bubble pops this or the next year. So not a good trade for your bitcoins right now.

You would miss your sold coins never to see them again for under $1000. Since the upside potential is much higher than the downside risk, it makes much more sense to hold.

@_date: 2017-01-06 15:00:06
??? You mean bitcoin *related* drama?
@_date: 2017-01-06 18:17:05
Because bitcoin is valuable, the value derives from its current real uses (mainly store of value and remittances) and its many potential uses. Also, behind the curtains there is a huge growth in the bitcoin ecosystem development that a regular folk can't see because it's ignored by the media.
If you buy for day trading you may lose money, but if you hold long term, it has been proven you get nice ROI. And bitcoin has barely started, think of the Internet/email in the 90's. A decentralized technology that has a valuable use it's not going to disappear, even if a few tyrannical governments try to "ban" it.

The only way is to contact Authy to have them 'reset' your account. They have great customer service, they did mine in less than 2 days total (obviously you have to wait a little for security reasons). Coinbase has instructions about how to do this contact Authy) on the sign in page on the bottom, I think it is after entering your ID and password and prompting you for the Authy code, then you click on: "I don't have the code" or something like that.

That's why trusted, fully licensed and regulated US exchanges are useful as on-ramp, despite all the hate they get here.  It is much more probable to lose your bitcoins if you store them by yourself, unless you are tech savvy. How many people in the world out of every 100 are tech savvy? Less than 1.
Coinbase stores &gt;99% of the coins offline, they can't be stolen/hacked like the shady and unlicensed/unregulated companies in the past and its Vault is a great place to keep your bitcoins safe.

It is always a good time to buy bitcoin if you are holding long term and not just for day trading.

Yes, but all that it's doing and it will continue to do: To ever increase the value/scarcity of the viable coins left, so keep hodling. It does not matter if just fewer are left, since each bitcoin is divisible in many decimal points, so it will be always enough sub-units to trade.

Not much, I think they just check that you are the legitimate user of your email, that's the way they really know you were not hacked.

Chinese are panic-selling due to the government inspections (that's why for the first time in years you see $30 cheaper price in China), but there is a hard bottom at $750, where the rest of the world (USA, Europe, India, etc) are scooping up those cheap coins.

Regarding buying, that is a small amount, I would buy it all now, not worth in this case the 'dollar cost averaging' if you plan to hold long term, you could miss the next bull run and be buying at much higher prices (ending up with fewer coins than buying now).

You are right, but this is about the perception for the masses (most of them feel the need to have "permission" by the Government for everything, since they leave in fear of it).

@_date: 2016-12-22 03:01:15
MANY reasons. It was overdue. The price is ridiculously low right now if you do the math. Bitcoin is extremely scarce and will be much more unavailable as time goes on.
Imagine that somebody told you in the 90's that there would be 21 million shares of the Internet, ever. If you had one of those hypothetical shares, you would be a millionaire now. Whoever owns one bitcoin now and holds it for a few decades, will be set for a wealthy retirement.
You will not hear so much about bitcoins then, since everything will be priced in 'millibits', 'satoshis', etc.

This "bubble" (more like 'cycle') is just starting, my guess is this time we go to around $5,000 and then "crash" and stabilize for a little bit around $2000. This cycle is backed by more solid fundamentals, developments and investments than the previous ones. If you are hodling long term and not just day trading: always is a good time to buy bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-12-11 20:46:00
Just a symbolic one of another 0.25% (25 basis points), like last December when they were forced to do the first hike in many years after a lot of hype talk to save face, and that provoked the worst US stocks open in January and gold went up. They are backed into a corner.
@_date: 2016-12-29 18:24:56
If bitcoin becomes the world currency the upper bound would be on the tens or hundreds of millions per bitcoin, you are leaving so much out of the picture. A big picture should include all current and future uses and applications of bitcoin (really limitless in potential), and other assets and debt (gold, global derivatives over a quadrillion dollars, etc). So the "Big Picture" is really much bigger than we could imagine today.

Maybe, but I think those sold coins would be scooped up pretty quick by long term hodlers, as it has been the case for all the last dumps. I feel hodlers are squeezing out day traders/pure speculators out of many coins systematically, since the supply is getting shorter and shorter as time passes, at the same time that the demand will be ever increasing. So I don't see any long-lasting drop in price.
@_date: 2016-12-20 15:40:12

No, they keep 99.9% of the bitcoins offline in cold storage, and they have many strong layers of security. They are no MtGox or Bitfinex. Even the massive loss at the Bitfinex hack just caused a small hiccup, Bitcoin becomes more resilient, anti-fragile and stable every year.

Gemini.com or Coinbase.com are fully licensed and regulated by the US Government and Agencies, they comply with all KYC/AML laws and regulations.
Coinbase Vault is very safe for storage, they store &gt;99% of bitcoins offline on cold storage, so they can't be hacked/stolen. If you are not tech savvy (like &gt;99% of world population) it's much more probable that you end up losing them (for many reasons) if you store them yourself.
