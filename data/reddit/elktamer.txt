Looks like silver and bitcoin are fairly similar after all.
@_date: 2013-04-08 03:06:43
BTC can be the opposite. If someone crosses a border with too little cash, they can be denied entry also. I think the GLBSE guy, "Nefario", got blocked from entering the US a couple of years ago for that reason.

Right, but it's the searches just before the crash that are the indicator.
If you look at the price of silver in 2011. 
Google trends predicted the drop perfectly.

That would be even more interesting if the amount was in btc. People would be able to speculate on the conversion rate.

Using the same pressure tactics as Trump doesn't make him look good.

How is 98% not bad? Sports books are paying "90%"( that's a terrible payout) on published odds. The actual odds are unknowable. With SatoshiDice, you are guaranteed to lose over the long run.

He says the exact opposite in the article I'm reading:

I've never played it, but the odds looks worse than craps or blackjack.

100% bullshit.  Charts predicting events that have already happened are worthless.  
The best to guarantee losing money on investments is to start believing in the tea leaves of technical analysis.

It's possible to find patterns, but they only apply to past events. The value in bitcoins is in using them as currency. People who think they're going to get wealthy by buying them as an investment are idiots. If we're strongly recommending remedial material, I'd suggest this:

That reads like an encounter someone wished had happened, but did not.

So the $64,000 question is, how was the pizza?

So brilliant but simple. 1% is insanely high though, and it shouldn't be tweeting every transaction.

The economist has said deposits are insured up 100k euros.

Isn't velocity one of the downsides to bitcoin? Velocity is increased by credit and transaction speed. The anonymity provided by bitcoin reduces the use of credit, and the time needed for transactions pushes people towards normal currency.

Things that "ring false" in the story are: lack of detail, reported poor grammar and profanity by someone representing ING in a public forum, the supposed affirmation of a conspiracy to stop bitcoin by an financial  insider, and most of all, the word "biodiversity".

That was the only problem I had with his "anti-social network" article, and it was more of an omission than an error. What other points would Charlie be schooling Krugman on?

No it doesn't. Blackjack has a 99.4% return for a six deck shoe. Craps has a 98.58 expected return.

Worse than greedy, it's suboptimal. The twitter version is so simple that if it's first it will become the standard, but to do that they need volume. The transaction fee is going to kill it.

Investment bubbles don't pop when the investment is something that the buyer has a purpose for other than just selling for a profit. As soon as everyone is buying just to sell to someone else, the ride is over.
@_date: 2013-04-16 00:11:34
Yes, that's what worked for me.
@_date: 2013-04-16 00:06:36
Did you log out and log back in?

I was thinking about this the other day. A short is when you borrow something, sell it, and eventually buy it back to replace the loan. A non finance example would be borrowing your neighbor's new lawn mower at the start of the summer, selling it at a garage sale, and then buying one back for cheap at the end of the end of the summer to replace it.
The best way to short bitcoins is to create a online wallet service where you track someone's balance for them, but have the ability to sell the bitcoins you manage on other people's behalf. So you can then "short" BTC by selling what you don't actually own, and then buying them back when they need to be replaced. (Not that MtGox is doing this, it would be too easy to track by checking the transaction history)

YW. It makes me wonder what other issues their site has when something so basic is broken.
