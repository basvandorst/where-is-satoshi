I am here for the memes. The better the memes the more Bitcoin goes up in value.
The worse the memes the drop in value.

Hahahaha probably sounds more interesting than it is.
I bought solar panels which cost about $80 a month and it pays for all my electricity. Last month I had to pay $25 on top of the bill. But it was a hot month.
I have my miners in my garage and only run them at night. So it doesn't heat up my house too much.
@_date: 2019-07-07 20:48:24
If no one sold then it wouldn't have any value.
Imagine you were starving with 100k in the bank. You died but still have the money in the bank.
The money is useless if you don't spend it.
Hodling is useless if no one spends it.

I'm sorry, your analogies don't make sense to me.  Why would you want to pull out of the exchanges?
@_date: 2019-07-07 21:05:02
So fellow genius, if no one ever sells and the price reaches infinity and no one sells, what good is it for anything?
@_date: 2019-07-11 06:24:23
What do you use to buy and sell?
I hate coinbase. There is like a $50 window for buying and selling. So if I buy at 10,000, then I have to wait until $10,050 to break even. If I sell at $10,100 then coinbase sells it for $10050. So even though there was a $100 increase in Bitcoin I wouldn't see any of that.
Say I wait for a $500 increase then sell. My luck is that would be the last time it is at that low.

Also, should have seen her face when she got it. Like wow! A framed piece of paper that says Bitcoin! Thanks!

This current price... Or this one?
@_date: 2019-07-14 21:11:23
You can almost assume some miners will pull the plug because they are no longer making profit off of mining.
I will continue to mine with my $4 a day setup powered by solar panels.
With the halvening it will probably drop to 2$ a day, but that is okay.

I gladly "throw away my vote" every 2 years.
@_date: 2019-07-16 06:54:11
No, she will get it again when I die, or her kids will when she dies.
She essentially threw my gift away. She only saw it as a worthless piece of paper. If her reaction was different like she was interested or anything other than realizing it had value a few years later.
Not your keys not your coin? She had both. And Bitcoin is anti-bank. If I didn't take the steps to backup then it would be money down the drain, at least I saved it for her family's future.
Also, if there ever come a time where she is really needing money, I will cash it for her in a second..
@_date: 2019-07-16 16:44:09
Yeah, I explained as best I could how much potential and value it could have in the future.
Keep it safe so when it has value you can sell it.
I put it in a picture frame with a picture of her family, so it was kind of hidden.
@_date: 2019-07-14 21:33:20
Very good point.
@_date: 2019-07-07 20:49:10

@_date: 2019-07-14 21:02:29
That's what they tell us and you bought into it.
Half of America didn't want Hillary or Trump. The powers, both foreign domestic have everyone, including you, convinced that a vote for something not blue or red is a vote for foreign power. Basically society is convinced that it's better to not vote at all over voting for a third party, when it couldn't be further from the truth.
@_date: 2019-07-08 15:21:56
If no one sold gold and the demand was there the price would reach infinity. If no one continued to sell it would be worthless because you can't eat gold.
Without the fundamental value of being able to sell gold it is worthless.

This is the quality posts I subbed for

I gave my sisters a Bitcoin each years ago. They lost em.
My oldest sister asked for it again last year or so. I was like I gave it to you on a piece of paper I said to keep safe.
Yeah it's my fault she lost it.
I saw this coming so I made two copies of that piece of paper. She isn't getting the copy.

No shit, I'm saying the same thing. Idiots on here saying everyone needs to hodl, I'm saying that can't/won't happen.
@_date: 2017-08-03 20:20:10
Yes, there is a big difference from my understanding that I won't be able to withdraw on a date from they are taking something I will never be able to have, which I was entitled.
The first one is a mild inconvenience, the latter is essentially stealing.

Who is getting the BCH from the bitcoins that Coinbase maintains? If not the users?
@_date: 2017-08-03 21:09:11
I'll probably just put it on my taxes as a loss if it isn't cleared up
@_date: 2019-08-13 19:57:22
I have properties as well. One of the houses I bought lost three factories in that town a few years later so now the house is worth about 3/4 what I paid for it. A property has no value unless people want it.
And Bitcoin does have intrinsic value. The same value as standard fiat. The only reason fiat works is because people respect the buying power, just like Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-08-13 20:53:06
Gold is a solid investment. It's tangible. Bitcoin isn't tangible in the physical sense, but it makes up for it in the fact that everyone has access to it.
Bitcoin did experience a recession for like 4 months at the beginning of the year it was worth less that 5k.
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:42:34
Instead of shitposting and trying to talk people down, better your irrelevant self.
@_date: 2019-08-13 19:44:40
You take $1000 and I'll put $1000 into Bitcoin.
Let's see the value after a year. Most likely you would lose $35 in value. Doesn't sound like cash is very good for futures.
@_date: 2017-08-03 20:00:18
I was unaware of it until now. I read a little bit about the split, I trusted coinbase to give me my dues. I saw something saying they won't let users withdraw on August 1st, that didn't bother me.
I didn't get an email, a phone call or a letter in the mail.
@_date: 2019-08-13 20:34:30
What I am trying to say is just because you invest in something secure doesn't necessarily guarantee that security.
@_date: 2019-08-13 20:47:04
Yeah, no one should sit on money. But every year, electricity and water bills increase, yet pay like the minimum wage do not. Until these are also addressed then an inflation system fails the average worker.

High is on a peak, low is before the peak.
@_date: 2019-06-01 18:49:38
Yeah it's possible, but with every Satoshi owned by a different person it gets more and more difficult.
If someone put in 45 billion they could really control the market. But 90% of people would probably cash out at the million dollar mark.
Just hodl and buy low and it really doesn't matter what the whales do unless you sell.
If a whale raises the price $200 then you buy then the whale sells and the price lowers $150 so you get scared and sell. Then it raises $300 so you buy again. Then it lowers $200 so you sell.
You lost hundreds of dollars in that situation. If you just bought and held then you wouldn't have lost anything and the only thing the whales did was prevent you from buying more.
@_date: 2019-06-09 20:24:54
Yeah, why wouldn't we convince them to mine with us to have 1 decentralized universal currency.

I have 5% of assets always ready to panic sell
@_date: 2019-06-17 17:37:34
No way man. If it wasn't traded then it wouldn't have any real value.
I could have paid my tattoo artist in cash. I helped spread Bitcoin and replaced what I bought.
Hodlers need traders to grow. I also bought coffee in Bitcoin. Now that coffee shop is more inclined to keep the service and other companies will recognize, which will also help grow.
I needed coffee, rather than go to the store, I supported a Bitcoin business which will help spread Bitcoin and encourage more people to hodl. 
Rather than just me hodling .005 bitcoin I spread it then purchase .0055 bitcoins. So I have created a demand of .0105  instead of just hodling .005 bitcoins
@_date: 2019-06-17 05:53:44

Agreed, all it seems to do is send coins.
Even if facebook did allow you to keep the coins. I would assume that they are able to be create coins out of thin air. Even if it has to be mined, then what is it doing that bitcoin doesn't do? Other than a larger forced mass adoption.
The biggest thing is people need to value the currency. It took bitcoin years to be trusted. The people who do trust it likely wont be purchasing facebooks version. The people who don't trust bitcoin would they be more likely to trust facebooks?
The one thing facebook does have is mass adoption potential. Give everyone 10 coins on launch day and tell everyone it can buy anything that can be paid for by paypal, at $10 a coin, people would probably like that. But would that increase the value of the coin? Bitcoins biggest value is users who HODL, will facebook coin users want to hold?
*Edit this will also be pegged to Gov't issued currencies.
To me this means say it is really popular and is selling for 10$ a coin then people really like it so they like it so the demand is driving the price to $20 a coin. Facebook just has to double the amount of coins made. They get to keep the coins, and the coins are still worth $10. The average user is still paying $10 a coin but now the amount doubled and they won't ever see that benefit.

Just buy $1. If a haircut is $13 cut your own hair, buy $12. If a Starbucks coffee is $4 make your own coffee buy $3 in Bitcoin.
After a few months you'll have a couple hundred in Bitcoin and at the same time developing good saving habits being frugal.
If I want to invest $12, I'll save $4, put $4 into stocks and $4 into Bitcoin. Diversify.

This was 15% a pretty huge drop. Is my understanding correct that 15% of the bitcoins we're sold?
@_date: 2018-11-15 05:34:46
Thanks for the run down. I saw the crash earlier and I bought $30 worth. 
Even if it pans out to nothing I'll give my grandkids Satoshis every year for Christmas, and they will be like what the fuck is this made up shit grandpa keeps giving us.
I'm investing in my future.

That would be too honest.
@_date: 2018-02-02 20:41:21
Now is the time to buy if you think it's a dip.
If you think this is the peak then count your losses and sell.
Sell and regret when it bounces. Or buy and regret when it dips further.
Don't get out because it didn't do what you expected, the market never does what anyone expects. Play the market.

Well if it's in a bunch of television, that more than likely means the producers have money in it and want the shills to buy it raise the value so they could sell.
This is like propaganda 101.
Just saying, if they do sell then buy the dip.
@_date: 2019-05-14 16:20:40
What blows my mind is if the government bailed out the layman then the layman would have been able to pay the banks, so the banks wouldn't have gone bankrupt. The layman would have kept their homes and it would have helped more people.
Printing money and not putting it in the right places doesn't help anyone.
Giving money to the people at the top doesn't trickle down. They probably think it does because if you give them 100k they will spend 10k. If you give 100k people in need 1k they will all spend the 1k and be slightly better off.
@_date: 2019-05-12 11:08:15
I'm ignorant, but if the government were to implement negative interest.
Without taking money from bank accounts wouldn't it be not printing more money and removing dollars as they are paid debts/taxes.
