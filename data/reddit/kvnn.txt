It's good to have this context about your posts. While I am opposed to your preferred outcome, I'm now less opposed to you personally. 


Very interesting - I'd like to hear more if you're compelled.

Has Mike or Gavin responded to Luke Jr's analysis [1]?

And what value do you wish to transfer that you currently cannot, because of the block size?
@_date: 2015-06-18 05:16:17
THANK YOU for reposting, I hadn't read this yet.
@_date: 2015-06-16 04:57:31
Also, regarding forks: 
@_date: 2015-06-08 22:58:14


What do you mean that his analysis does not accept that?
@_date: 2015-06-16 03:14:39


Do you mind sharing what you've contributed to core? With such a stance, I'm certain you have had many years of vested effort and care deeply about these issues. 
@_date: 2015-06-08 23:04:20
Is he really advocating 20MB blocks in the episode (as the notes suggest)? Hasn't Gavin retracted the 20MB suggestion as untenable and begun to advocate 8MB?
@_date: 2015-06-16 03:05:19
Honest question: why are you here?
@_date: 2015-06-03 06:35:45
You forgot the "and so we shouldn't listen to him when it comes to block size". I don't understand why someone would be so aggressively adamant about increasing the block size - to the point of harassing one of the most prolific core devs out there - unless they are trolling or fanatic. Either way - I'm surprised u/nullc is continuing to show up around here. What a waste.

Credit is one of the issues I *feel* that Bitcoin could solve rather elegantly, but I'm not sure how. Any thoughts?
@_date: 2015-06-16 04:39:34
You don't know what you're talking about. 
@_date: 2015-06-16 03:07:19
It's already forked, and no one tried to stop it. They are trying to stop people from lobbying miners, node operators and exchanges to switch to a different Bitcoin entirely (BitcoinXT, in this case). Having some of these operators in the network switch would start to make the network lose consensus. 
@_date: 2015-06-09 05:36:45


How so?
@_date: 2015-06-08 23:12:45
You are paying attention to the wrong things. Look at the [release log]( This "debate" is certainly distracting, but its not halting development by any means.
@_date: 2015-06-08 23:14:29
What does that have to do with his analysis?
@_date: 2015-06-09 14:23:30


And this is the "breaking point" that Mike Hearn is referring to? Or does he believe something else entirely? [Feel free to ignore if you haven't listened to the episode and / or prefer me to just listen to it.]
@_date: 2015-06-16 05:07:08
Yeah. Also: I wish I were more skilled :P
@_date: 2015-05-21 17:02:30
Awesome idea. On the TODO.
@_date: 2015-05-21 18:52:09


Everything that you listed. I suppose it may not be a fundamental difference. I think that my feelings are a bit hurt, tbh. 
 is the type of thing that I was trying to accomplish with my skill set and without a team. :-/
EDIT: Oh, I'd still really appreciate a link to the protocol you mentioned. Cheers.
@_date: 2015-05-19 20:40:13
Awesome, I'm glad to learn about it.
@_date: 2015-05-31 02:38:30
Curious, what formula are you using to value bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-05-21 17:02:15
Can you elaborate on what you mean by "site operator"? I get the feeling that you have a perspective on this that I'm daft to, and could learn something from.
@_date: 2015-05-31 02:59:32
Did you read the very first sentence in my post?
@_date: 2015-05-21 17:20:31
Thanks for the candor. I appreciate your points, but believe that you may be misunderstanding the point of the project, and how mature it currently is.


Is there a much better way, without much more expense?


Good point.


EDIT: I just realized that you co-wrote the Sidechains paper. Its incredible, thank you.
@_date: 2015-05-21 18:01:38
Ah - thats trivial for anyone forking this.
@_date: 2015-05-19 17:18:48


Really?! Any idea who/what?


Certainly not, but thats not what I'm offering. I'm offering a way for images to be collectively paid for before becoming public.


Thanks! I hadn't seen Patreon before.
@_date: 2015-05-19 17:03:52
EDIT: Sorry, I'll be more sincere. 0.4337999999999999634070491084 BTC have already been sent to that img's address. I, personally, don't think that its helpful to use Satoshis as a denomination in this case.
@_date: 2015-05-21 16:44:00
The more I think about this the more I think its a good idea. Especially for allowing people to play with the site without having to transfer an entire Bitcoin. And I'm thinking of implementing it so that there are suggested values, so that people don't have to think. 
@_date: 2015-05-21 16:32:56
Not at the moment. Its a trivial change (literally just adding a form input, the backend already supports it), but I wanted to keep it as simple as possible before get feedback like this. Thanks.
@_date: 2015-05-21 19:16:14
Awesome, thank you!
@_date: 2015-05-21 17:27:21


This is bothering me quite a bit. It could not be built just as well using Paypal. Integrating Paypal into this process changes the thing completely. I do understand that your ideals are quite a bit higher, and I'm sure that will be even more poignant once I can read the protocol you've mentioned, but I disagree strongly with this statement.
@_date: 2015-05-05 15:35:54
How many incoming connections are you receiving? It seems like you know this - but incoming connections are typically router-blocked by default.

God, what stupid commentary we have here. The relevant section is actually pretty good.
TLDR: **"we conclude that the developers will have [the most governing] influence in the long run"**. 
Literally nothing was said about *government*.
@_date: 2015-05-21 16:36:31
I think it'd be tough to make the money that those guys made on the darknets (presumably, before the fappening) with something like BtcImg unless they developed a reputation for consistently delivering. Otherwise, why would anyone believe that the image was actually what the author said that it was?
@_date: 2015-05-21 15:39:29
Hey all, I've built [btcimg.com]( as an example of something that could not be done without Bitcoin. I'd be happy if anyone found it useful. Please let me know of any questions or ideas.

I can think of at least one problem with any sort of mining centralization: The higher likelihood of a successful double spend by the miner. Are you unconcerned with this?

Hi Paul, we've spoken briefly about Truthcoin and I'm a huge proponent of a Bitcoin-sidechain Truthcoin.
Are you advocating that people use a Truthcoin sidechain to place blocksize-related bets that hedge their Bitcoins against a change in value caused by blocksize?
@_date: 2015-07-14 20:24:49
Wow. Thanks. Is there discussion taking place about this on any other public forums?

Hey! I've open sourced &amp;&amp; made it so that you can easily use any other Linux Foundation list / subreddit. You can do a bit of work in spiders.py to include another mailing-list host (I can help with SourceForge if you'd like). See 
@_date: 2015-08-04 20:08:54
I can't even wrap my head around your argument here. I've read a lot of what Mike has been saying and I think I'd boil it down to: "Yes, increasing the block size **might** cause problems, but we can fix them if it does and its worth it to increase adoption". I'm not assuming anything really, just deducing everything he has said into a summation.
If you disagree, please elaborate.

@_date: 2015-07-02 16:57:27
I disagree. One of the reasons I built this was so that people (mostly myself) can consume the mailing list without interacting with it directly. Its a **development** list, which, by the nature of bitcoin and development means that the barrier of entry to being able to productively participate is super high.

Hello and thanks. 
Do you have a mechanism for the blocking of some sidechains? I wasn't able to watch the entirety of videos  and  - did I miss this? Or is it just incredibly obvious: "don't support them in Bitcoin Core?" Or, "be okay with miners refusing to mine some smart contracts"?
And the reason that we need some smart-contracts to be blocked is that, among other scenarios, a "Reputation Free-Rider Problem" (one oracle simply copying a high-reputation oracle's output) is inevitable. How would the free-rider problem actually be solved?
And - a little off topic - it seems like a large portion of your goal is re-educate some people on what concepts like "permissionless" and "censoring" and "freedom" mean (mostly in terms of positives and negatives) when it comes to Bitcoin. How is that going? How important is it, in your opinion?
Also, I think that your concluding statement is most concise: **"Treat sidechains with the care/respect of a soft fork"**
Edit: sorry for misspelling your name! I do know how to pronounce it, for what it's worth :p
@_date: 2016-05-16 20:05:32
