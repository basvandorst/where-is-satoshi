I think that there are large segments of the geek/gamer community who are still yet to be reached. Since they're more likely than the general population to be interested in bitcoin, I think they're a kind of low hanging fruit and should be grasped after before expanding outreach.

That's not necessarily true. Assuming his friend is good for the 0.2BTC there's not much difference between having it sit in a wallet and lending it out.
That's different from a short, which is what his friend may be doing. If his friend sells the 0.2BTC for cash immediately on borrowing it with the understanding he'll have to buy 0.2BTC later in order to repay the OP, that would be a genuine bet against bitcoin's value.

You don't make more money by joining a bigger pool, you just get smaller payouts more often. It evens out exactly.
It is precisely this misconception that leads to people joining the largest pools despite the fact that it helps them none and weakens the network.

Right but bitcoin doesn't address the regulatory issues discussed in this article. All funding campaigns are subject to these regulations regardless of what methods of payment they accept.
@_date: 2014-01-13 20:27:03
So let me explain. I mine with about 30GH/s. At the current difficulty, that works out to 0.25BTC/month.
If I join a pool with a 50% share in the network, I will on average get a payout every twenty minutes. If I join a pool with a 1% share in the network, I will on average get a payout every 17 hours, or 1/500th as often. However, the payouts at the smaller pool will exactly 500 times larger (because the 25BTC block reward for the rare block we *do* find is being divided up fewer ways, get it?). At the end of the month, I still have my 0.25BTC.
The only difference is the variance and frequency of confirmed payments, my profit is unaffected. A basic fact about how pools work is that it doesn't matter what size pool you mine on, in the end it'll work out.

Volatility isn't evidence of inefficiency--the swings could well represent the market reacting to news and quickly changing conditions, which is the definition of efficient behavior.
To prove that the Gox market is inefficient you would have to have evidence that the swings are being driven by people with inside information or that the market is reacting irrationally to the news (e.g. overbuying or overselling). Those are plausible hypotheses but your conclusion is by no means obvious.

I've made arguments like this before but they never seem to go over as well as I'd like.
I think the problem is that if bitcoin fails (either because of a competing cryptocurrency or because we're all wrong about its utility), it kind of does look like a ponzi scheme. Early adopters make money because they got in so cheap and sold while it was high, late adopters lose everything.
Unlike a ponzi scheme though, if bitcoin succeeds everyone wins, there's no eventual, inevitable implosion. This is what really makes bitcoin different from a ponzi scheme in my opinion.

Yeah, though this is really a thing about public key cryptography rather than a thing about the blockchain or bitcoin.
If you're interested in this, look into PGP. The most direct way of doing this would be to include a PGP signature at the end of your book. Free hundred characters! The idea is the same--PGP includes both a way to encrypt messages so that only a certain other person can read them, and a way to sign messages with your private key so that other people can verify only you (or someone with your private key) could have written it.

I can see that I've offended you. I am honestly sorry.
In marketing land, as I'm sure you know, products are marketed with demographics in mind. Bitcoin users aren't a large market, but relative to say Coca-cola drinkers they're a demographically narrow market---the majority of bitcoin users are young men. 
So what I'm trying to communicate to Riot here is that since the majority of League of Legends players are young men (not all, of course) adopting bitcoin will give them more business than they might otherwise think---that's because the demographics line up so well *in aggregate terms.*
Bitcoin could never meet our high expectations if it were somehow only interesting to young males. Bitcoin is a revolutionary and disruptive technology. Bitcoin is for everyone. That doesn't mean that I'm going to try to convince AARP magazine or Pinterest or Bratz doll company to adopt bitcoin by telling them it will make them money. It won't make them money yet. The demographics just don't match up.
I hope that clarifies my thinking, and if my thinking still offends you (or as usual made things worse), all I can say is that it was not my intention to cause offense and I am certainly glad to listen with open ears to whatever you have to say on the issue.

I think his point is that for example if I'm a wealthy citizen in a country with strict capital controls, and I want to leverage the pseudo-anonymity and easy transfer properties of bitcoin to move a large sum of fiat currency out of the country, the price of bitcoin doesn't really matter.
It's true that with wider adoption it would be easier to convert back to fiat on the other side, but that's secondary to the basic point that if you treat bitcoin like a payment service layered on top of fiat rather than like a currency, the technical advantages are more important than the market price.
@_date: 2013-12-28 03:37:20
When your asset allocation (i.e. percentages in different investments) changes due to one investment doing well it's called "organic growth". A lot of people would periodically sell off the excess bitcoin as it goes up in order to keep their asset allocation the same. You'd do the opposite if bitcoin went down, unless you decided to change your strategy.

The OP's advice would have been right if posted at any time before the December crash, just as it is right now.
Here's an anecdote---in the rumblings leading up to the 2008 crash, an investment consultant friend of mine had a client tell her to sell everything and put the lot of it in gold. My friend protested but the client said if she wouldn't do it he'd find someone who would.
That guy made a lot of money (though I'm not sure how he did in the recovery), but *his decision was still wrong*. He doesn't have secret knowledge about the future behavior of markets. He just got lucky. Being lucky once doesn't mean your reckless decision was smart at the time you made it.

I think this is a great idea! Bitcoins are a good fit for microtransaction based business models because they're so easy to send and can't be reversed. 
I know I'll be sending them a note, and I'd suggest that anyone who has the time write them a personal email explaining why this would make you happy and why it might be big for them. League gamers are a tech savy bunch, and the target market is a good match.
@_date: 2013-04-08 23:01:57
Brutal, I imagine that would have to come down to reflect the increase in bitcoin's price. Since the miner's costs are likely to continue to be denominated in fiat, if bitcoin prices are at $50k I imagine a substantially smaller fee in BTC terms would cover those costs and compensate them fairly for their contributions to the network.

You also have to remember, as the price gets higher the routine fluctuations will get larger in dollar terms. If BTC is worth $10,000 a coin, a hundred-dollar swing is a blip, noise. Now that we're getting towards the big leagues, keep in mind that 5% is nearly $15.
Not ever $20 swing is a huge correction anymore.
@_date: 2013-04-08 22:59:32
Well right, but the price would be moving to reflect the (apparently newfound in this scenario) demand for bitcoin as a tool to move money across borders. Maybe a couple large transfers like this as a proof of concept would be all that it would take to jumpstart an industry of bitcoin based international money transfers. Then it wouldn't be slippage per se because the price wouldn't immediately revert---you would get the same amount of money back when you liquidated into fiat as you did when you bought the coins, or maybe even more.

It's because the difficulty is what actually affects how easy it is to mine a block. The hashrate is just a leading indicator for the difficulty. If what you care about is where the network is going, than the hashrate is probably the more interesting number. 
If you're trying to calculate how much money your mining equipment is going to make today, then the hashrate is a less important number to know than the difficulty.

One of two things is true about this post---either it is not relevant to bitcoin and it shouldn't be here, or it is relevant to bitcoin because it's negative news about a competitor, news we're spreading because we want to protect bitcoin from crypto-currency competitors.
If it's the latter, and I suspect it is, I say take it somewhere else. I think the community has something to gain from avoiding the appearance of internal bickering about which cryptocurrency is the way forward. The biggest task is to convince outsiders of the *idea* of cryptocurrency, not to squabble about which ones are best.
I think articles and links that aren't about bitcoin shouldn't be here. This is just another "bitcoin users unaffected" post in disguise.

Hm I get what you're saying, let me try another tack.
Suppose that you have never bet on a horse race before and you know nothing about horse races. You pick a random horse because you like the name and it wins. You win $100.
The guy next to you is a made man in the mafia. He has fixed this race and bets on the horse that is fixed to win. 90% of the time, his horse wins and he wins $100. 10% of the time his horse breaks his legs and another horse wins. This time, his horse breaks his leg and loses. He loses $100.
All I'm saying is that if the mafia guy had leaned over and whispered, "Hey v1-, bet on Pink Pony to win", he would have been giving you *good advice* since that horse was more likely to win than a random horse. Whether that horse broke his leg this particular time is beside the point.
EDIT: Put another way, the mafia guy shouldn't feel like he made the wrong choice. He made the right choice because his decision making process gave him the best chance of winning.

Good point! Here's mine---
Subject: Bitcoin payments
Dear good support folks at Riot,
I love League of Legends, and my friends and I have been playing since the old days. I've spent more than I care to admit on skins and champions, and I have no regrets. These days, along with League, one of my hobbies is accumulating and mining bitcoins, the virtual currency that has been getting so much press attention lately.
Bitcoin payments are easy to send, non-reversable, easy to track, and can be instantly converted into dollars or a currency of your choice through a growing selection of services such as Coinbase. These services have been proven to work for large scale distributed web businesses such as Reddit and Wordpress. I know that the smart folks at those two companies probably didn't add bitcoin support (just) because they think it's a cool idea, but because they know that bitcoin adoption is a smart way to get good press and attract additional business from young, male, and tech-savvy customers.
Since it so happens that those same demographics are exactly your target market, I strongly suggest that you seriously consider accepting bitcoin as a payment method for your own virutal currency, Riot Points.
I know that I would be excited to purchase your products with my beloved coins, and I'm sure others like me would as well. I wish you all the best, and thank you for developing and maintaining such an amazing product as League of Legends.
Your name here
