You do not btw have to send the words exactly as given.
You can for example add 3 words that don't belong that perhaps have personal meaning to you. In this way the potential thief doesn't know even how many words you sent. Same thing with the book -- add some words that only you know to subtract out.
Obviously: Physical security of book and perhaps more than one page with random words on it.

I think Bitcoin will be used for other things that eventually put Bitcoin into many more hands before merchants accept it generally. How do most people who have BTC now get it? Probably they buy it and such people probably aren't buying it just to spend it. But if there are more businesses that are fundamentally Bitcoin-based, they will have a lot of Bitcoin to shed probably as salaries/bonuses and those employees will have Bitcoin they will be happy to spend.

i know of more than one company that only became really successful when they changed direction and ironically not because they wanted to. etrade once only provided services (a menu-based, pre-internet order system that let people use their pc to enter orders rather than calling a broker) to another brokerage or brokerages (maybe it was just schwab) but when that broker decided to develop their own online order software etrade had to become a brokerage themselves and the rest is history.

I don't know if this is related but I sure would like to be able to use my Bitcoin as collateral for a loan: I want to get cash, maybe from a debit card and be able to repay it without actually liquidating my BTC holdings. I believe such businesses exist.

My OP was: Take your BTC out of exchanges. 
If they never sell coins to their customers who are buying from any source other than other customers who are selling or of course by buying these coins from say another exchange, you are correct.
But if a bunch of coins that have not moved for a long time do not appear irresistible, I would be surprised. They would argue that they have enough fiat to buy BTC in the case that the idle coins are suddenly wanted by their owners.

Miners want money but they are also interested in what is best for Bitcoin in the long run. The big ones have spent millions on hardware and want to collect money year in, year out for as long as possible and as much as possible.

News is far less important than actual activity: When the things mentioned in the news items actually get going and demand for Bitcoin rises, then the price should move.
In this respect, a currency is much different than a stock. Stock prices are driven by news and earnings but "usage" of stock is quite different (except maybe at things like IPOs) than usage of a currency.

Of course 30k (about today's volume) is the upper limit. But there are many exchanges and I am guessing that the world volume across all exchanges was more like 100k BTC. I don't know where you get 1% -- I don't think it's 100% but it also isn't 1%. 
My point is that a *modest* percentage, leads at current volumes to the supply drying up in a fairly short time.
We'll see. I hope your money is where you fucking mouth is, zeroday neg karma dumbass.

I think that for people who aren't comfortable with managing their own keys and i certainly agree it is complex and there is deliberate misinformation circulated about these subjects to scare people; anyway, for such people maybe just an investment vehicle that does not pretend to treat Bitcoin as a currency is best and there are such things already.

Greeks are probably getting savings in cash (Euros); some have so much that they will want to convert to Bitcoin to move them out of the country without danger of confiscation or theft. 
But without an exchange I assume this will be a slow process of finding Bitcoin sellers who probably have to operate secretly. Both sides will be suspicious of each other and both sides run the risk of arrest.
So even if the demand is present (which I think it probably is if Greeks are in danger of having savings confiscated or at least frozen by their government) the process of moving a lot of Greeks' savings into Bitcoin will be a slow one.
@_date: 2015-06-04 05:17:21
Well, to me the issue is one of incredible inefficiency. Because in theory at least if not in practice, most of what is doen in a bank branch could totally be rendered unnecessary if all of its customers used Bitcoins. Loans still will require bankers who look at credit history, obtain collateral, etc. But most of what happens in a bank -- what the people waiting in line in an airconditioned building with multiple employees that must have a monthly lease of tens of thousands of dollars is just depositing and withdrawing money.

When people started to realize that comic books could become valuable, they started to make comic books that were intended from the outset to be valuable but as far as I know this never really happened. Same with coins that were deliberately minted in very small quantities. 
I think the above is relevant to the Bitcoin vs Altcoin value question. You can't decree value -- it sort of has to be earned in various ways.
In the case of Action Comics  for example, two big things happened: most of the comics were probably destroyed (I think this in part had to do with the war effort where paper got recycled -- if not maybe the comics just got thrown out because no one could see a good reason to keep them.) The other of course was that the character of Superman caught on in a big way and grew steadily over the decades with big-budget films and countless comic books all based on the the character from 1939.
Maybe because Bitcoin was created to serve a purpose rather than to created wealth and now there is the network effect or whatever that makes a newcomer likely not to be received with much enthusiasm.

One of the most concrete things that come with lack of swings, irrespective of the source of these swings, is that merchants and other business users probably feel more secure in holding BTC. And concretely, those businesses that hedge to protect themselves have recently found that hedging costs have gone down.
Many have mentioned that pot sellers should be natural adopters of BTC to avoid armored cars that come with cash transactions. One seller at least said he did not use BTC because of volatility -- the current stability may be changing some minds.

Some of that might be between addresses held by the same individual. In fact, probably a lot of it is.
I would be very interested in knowing if there is way of determining from blockchain.info how many BTC end up going to addresses and remaining there. I assume there is.

You certainly raise a good point: An exchange could functionally entirely in that way.
But traditional stock brokerages do, for example, loan shares to customers to facilitate shorting and I see no reason why the loaning (not necessarily to short BTC) could not happen at an exchange.
So my original point, if an exchange **does use** coins owned by other customers to allow a customer to withdraw BTC to their own external address then withdrawing your coins rather than leaving them at an exchange would create demand for BTC that did not previously exist.
I think my implication that off-chain transactions always means that  customer coins are used in this fashion should have been clarified.
I have no issue with exchanges doing whatever they want (as long as it is consistent with their published terms) and never said that I did although my original point may well be buried at this point.
But let me ask you this: Can you say for sure that in the case of every exchange off-chain transactions are not done using coins in the accounts of customers who, for example, have left them idle for a long time and therefore are likely "not to miss them" if they are temporarily used to put in an external address?
@_date: 2015-06-27 22:26:03
Why does it have to be Greeks adopting BTC? Maybe it's Greeks who have access to their savings simply don't want it in physical form?
@_date: 2015-06-07 21:46:30
I did not say fractional reserve -- but if they don't it means they only sell BTC of customers who have sell orders outstanding or have sold to the exchange itself.
@_date: 2015-06-20 07:53:18
We will see. Not up to me how it will be used but I think I have made clear what I think will happen with Bitcoin is.
@_date: 2015-06-07 17:30:23
With regard to Wikileaks, etc.: Sure, but this entity, overwhelmingly concerned that Bitcoin remains viable would also be concerned with not acting in an imperious manner that alienates users and potential users of Bitcoin.
Could Bitcoin remain Bitcoin in this hypothetical scenario (one single computer handling processing)? I have read that no, then Bitcoin would just be a bank (or something -- people are not clear about what this would mean).
But it seems to me that even in this completely centralized case, Bitcoin offers things that were not available prior to Bitcoin. Would it still not offering services to the unbanked? Faster and cheaper funds transfer for remittances? All this blockchain stuff that somehow revolutionizes title registration?
If it does not, would having instead of one such computer, what about 10 of them? Or 100?

@_date: 2015-06-01 21:09:47
Given that really low prices allow any number of entities to purchase all available Bitcoin, prices below say, 100/BTC seem pretty unlikely to me -- I would bet every penny I have that 1 dollar short of government intervention is not happening.
A floor would be the cost that miners incur per coin.

Henny was an interesting comic, a vestige of vaudeville who lasted into the TV age. I recommend watching him in the roasts of the 1960s or 1970s or even 1980s he was in; he did not pretend to be fast on his feet -- he just steered everything to his old material, no actual roasting of the guest of honor and this cracked up the other comics to no end.
@_date: 2015-06-20 03:44:26
I would rather have risky currency than one that I can't touch at all.
Empirically, it looks like the downside is about 20% and given that BTC could also go up tremendously, I could see some Greeks deciding they would like their savings in a mobile form that is untouchable by anyone but themselves.
And they don't have to put it *all* in BTC -- just some.
@_date: 2015-06-07 22:21:21
Wow, my argument is stupid? I read that an exchange may do off-chain transactions between customers -- assuming that this is true, it is 100% true that if there were no coins from customers left on the exchange, the exchange would be forced to obtain the coins externally, assuming that indeed they obtain the coins when an order is executed.
What's "stupid" here, smart guy?
@_date: 2015-06-04 13:52:22
how does that defeat the purpose of the loan? if you pay off the loan on time, you will not lose the coins; if not, you will lose them just like any other collateral.

You mean, if I think I just bought a BTC and it turns out I did not, it is fraud? Maybe it depends what the terms and conditions of the exchange are. Maybe they explicitly say, "You are guaranteed of the order executing at the price at the time of the order." But maybe it does not say when the order is actually settled or when the BTC are available to withdraw or if it does say, maybe there is a very liberal time period for the exchange to do the above.

I think Blockbuster had its arguments why people wanted to visit a physical location. Some sounded reasonable but in the end they apparently were not.
@_date: 2015-06-07 22:08:39
It depends upon the policies of the exchange. I don't know what an exchange does when you execute a buy. Does it immediately either buy or allocate already-bought coins to that customer? Or does it merely record the buy and only execute the buy after the customer actually wants to move the BTC to an outside address.
All I can say for sure is that some exchanges admit to off-chain transactions. The implications are clear but proving what exactly happens I can't do -- but if the situation exists wherein an exchange would not be able to immediately provide BTC to every customer who wanted to move the coins to an outside address I would not be surprised.
@_date: 2015-06-29 12:15:11
Anyone who is receiving money, paid directly to a bank account should consider getting BTC instead. Anyone who withdrew money and is sitting on a bunch of physical (stealable) cash should consider buying BTC. You don't buy BTC just to spend it; you use it to avoid banks as middlemen.
@_date: 2015-06-27 08:33:49
Well, if this entire amount were used to buy the 21 million BTC then each BTC would be worth 1 million dollars. That would be nice. And that's just China. 
You know, I doubt that this will happen but  it can't be ruled out. I think it can be ruled out with some other investments, however.
@_date: 2015-06-17 06:33:59
I am thinking that in principle there is nothing limiting the rate of appreciation. In the stock market while there have been fast run ups, the speed of change in the stock market is limited by a variety of factors: the market closes and does not run on weekends. (At least Nasdaq and NYSE.) Companies release news according to rules. I am sure there are other things that make stock market change slower than Bitcoin change.
Bottom line: Maybe Bitcoin can move much faster than we imagine. I sure don't know where 4-6 months comes from. You might be right but there is no evidence; in fact, we have seen extremely fast change on many occasions.
@_date: 2015-06-11 09:03:44

@_date: 2015-06-28 23:23:05
Well, if even one person doesn't use it it won't be universal. But it could certainly work as a non-universal currency.
I am puzzled by people questioning how Bitcoin "could" work as if it isn't already working. It already is working, more people are adopting it all the time and even if it dropped significantly in price that doesn't mean it isn't working.
Having said that, in order for it to "work" in the sense that a large number of people are able to use it instead of fiat, the price will have to go up a lot. A whole lot. (Many would say that is a very good thing.)

Obviously the fact that it goes up and down makes it feel doubtful. But here is a question: The truly amazing returns: MSFT, AAPL, AMAT (I owned this and remember how it went): did they always go straight up? I know AMAT scared me and I got out of it at .1% or so of its eventual price. 
I sold casino stocks that drifted at small profit when by waiting a year or so, I could have seen 10:1.
Point: patterns can't be reliable predictors for reasons that have been stated a million times.
EDIT: Listening to others: I lost big from this and remember: no one wants you to succeed. Maybe your parents and grandparents and kids -- those dependent upon you. Groucho said, no man is completely unhappy at the failure of his best friend. I have not forgotten that line but wish I had paid attention to it or encountered it earlier.
But as I said, there are for sure examples of stocks that moved "deceptively" and thus I sold too soon, which I will regret maybe for the rest of my life. Really.

I wish I had read your post -- I posted the same thing. I am not a lawyer either but I suggested that such "evidence" might be like evidence uncovered during an illegal search. But it just occurs to me: the evidence uncovered during an illegal search is not inadmissible because it is not believed but rather because it was obtained illegally. In the case of the evidence against Ross, not only should it be called into question because of how it was obtained but also because it may be false anyhow -- the source is extremely untrustworthy.

Yes: Isn't like rules of evidence where if for example you do an illegal search an uncover evidence in so doing it is not admissible. So if evidence is presented by an investigator who himself participated in the crime, doesn't that call into question the admissibility of that evidence also?

I am convinced that Bitcoin is not to pay for coffee. It is for if you will, loftier things. It may not even be a currency which does not mean that it can't in some cases be used simply to buy things.
Maybe it is only to pay for usage of the Blockchain for non-trivial uses like deed recording, etc. 
But I don't even think framing it as a currency is desirable. Making it a currency makes it a target of government and banks. Gold is mainly for jewelry and as a side effect of this it can be used to buy things -- usually not cups of coffee, however.
@_date: 2015-06-20 06:52:25
But irrespective of this party's motivations, someday someone will short BTC and then attempt to lower the price  in this sort of way or another way. So BTC has to be able to weather this sort of attack because there is absolutely no reason to believe it won't happen and soon.
What would be great is to seem vulnerable and yet be able to punish such attackers so badly they don't try it again (because they have been ruined).
Bitcoin is being used by legit businesses, not just speculators and destroying these businesses to make fast profits I don't think any "nice" person is in favor of.

@_date: 2015-06-19 05:28:18
I totally agree. A practical reason for accepting BTC (to avoid handling cash and the security costs) that as far as I know awaited BTC becoming more stable since one pot seller said that it was indeed volatility that made him unwilling to accept BTC. And to an extent, merchants accepting BTC contributes to further stability.
This also makes many pot buyers interested in acquiring BTC. This may be a pretty big deal with ripples into things like businesses that sell to pot dealers like greenhouse suppliers, etc.

what a stupid question. but to address it anyway: you could drive to the location unburdened by physical fiat and meet with an individual in the city where the exchange is to take place who *is* willing to exchange BTC for fiat -- there are many such people and that is why the price of BTC is what it is. You have thereby avoided all of the risk of carrying large amounts of cash while traveling which sadly seems to place you at risk from the very cops who are supposed to protect us.

What portion of all BTC traded is Localbitcoins? It seems like Bitstamp does about a third of this dollar volume, for example. 21000 BTC is .1% of all possible BTC. Maybe the world-wide volume is .5% so within 200 days *every* BTC is traded -- if of course there were no trading of the same BTC which there must be.
I am saying repeatedly: The volume is high enough to allow a significant portion of BTC to disappear into the hands of long-term holders and at that point the price will rise very fast.

It won't affect demand I guess if they only trade coins between customers who already want to buy/sell -- just being the middleman. But if they ever sell "idle" coins, indeed it would affect demand if everyone pulled out their BTC -- they would have to buy from external sources.

As trivial as this sounds I think it all indicates how the mindshare of Bitcoin has grown. He did not feel the need to explain it -- and frankly I am not sure I completely understand why grabbing a nip is related to Bitcoin -- but just very casually delivered the line as what amounted to punchline of the entire joke that started with swiping.
Summary: Bitcoin is getting more and more known and that can't be bad for it as either an indication of adoption or the potential for adoption because so many people out there are at least familiar now with the term and, in order to get the joke enough to laugh, must have some idea of what Bitcoin is.

This seemingly wildly optimistic argument sounds pretty reasonable to me: There are so many potential users and I think we are seeing growth in that number. I am not sure for the price to rise it takes anything other than an increase in users.
@_date: 2015-06-04 15:28:49
trying to think why not -- would avoid a lot of liability. i suspect originally exchanges did not think users were sophisticated enough to understand addresses or their generation. moreover, having a bunch of other people's BTC might have its advantages.
but right now, i think many would see the advantages of getting BTC deposited directly to their own address.
@_date: 2015-06-14 10:38:10
Nobody can meaure these quantities but what I am saying is that a steady rise in price is consistent with the price being a function of usage rather than speculation; moving up and the down feels a lot more like speculation to both me and everybody else, I would guess.
But even a 1 % move in a day is not strictly from a usage increase -- I would guess that there have not been days with the overall number of users or some other metric has increased that much so probably we are still seeing speculative gains but if so, at least they are smaller.
On the other hand, if the gains are speculative but based on more informed speculation (speculation is not always wrong but wild swings from speculation I would assert are indicative of that speculation being off).

As you imply, miners would be very concerned about the perception of Bitcoin.

Most tangible benefit from stability is cheaper for merchants to hedge and/or makes them more willing to accept. For example, a legal pot seller in Colorado, still unable to deposit cash in banks because the refuse to accept their money are forced to use armored cars and other security necessary for physical cash. This seller said that the volatility of the Bitcoin price made them unwilling to accept BTC which would solve their security problems.
Maybe some pot sellers are now starting to accept BTC.

@_date: 2018-08-08 06:10:32
What I wonder in countries where this is happening is why money works at all since someone taking it in payment at the accepted value already knows it will be worth less literally in the next minute -- I guess people still have cases where even if money is going to be worth less, they need to pay for something remotely or the thing they are selling is too value to trade directly for something. Like if you have a house, you have to sell it for money so you can buy food; I guess also if you sell a house you as rapidly as possible purchase perhaps a large quantity of non-perishable food and/or buy gold or foreign exchange if indeed the VZ government allows this.

there are people who use it for remittances who are affected primarily by volatility not by price.

but as far as facts: in the past 3 months, the price has been pretty stable.
@_date: 2015-06-04 22:54:55
Although many disagree, there is some reason to see that stability is better for merchants than even a fast rise because the cost of hedging is a function of volatility. So indeed, the hovering that you mention may result in more adopters than  the swift rise many want.
I want a swift rise also, but the point is, stability has its long-term benefits.

I am so amused by that episode. SPOILER ALERT:
Guys steal a bunch of gold and then go into suspended animation for 100 years -- see, past the statute of limitations! -- in a cave.
Twilight zone spends almost no time on this scientific wonder, nobody involved is concerned about getting into glass chambers as I recall. 
Anyhow, essentially they awaken, one is a skeleton due to the oversight of using glass in a rocky cave, and after killing each other first over the gold and then over water, the sole survivor dies without finding out that gold is no longer valuable.

In a discussion that decided the future of Bitcoin the idea that someone with .01 BTC has the same vote as someone with 1 or 1000 BTC is crazy.

if the Bolivar halves every 18 days, most crypto historically would in fact be better --it doesn't solve their problems but it is probably better to park it in some *relatively* stable asset that can't be confiscated and is tradeable without a bank -- buying dollars is probably not allowed but buying crypto can't be prevented. anyone who bought most major crypto at any point prior to now is better off than someone who held Bolivars.

The problem when writing about very exceptional people, especially physicists (or great engineers which is more what NT was) is, I suggest, that pretty big demands are placed on the biographer: the writer probably should be a physicist. I guess they could have access to physicists but they would have to know the right questions to ask and be able to understand the answers.
I am not sure if any bio about him has been written by someone qualified. Stuff I have read about his science has been tinged with mysticism -- this might be the result of a non-scientist tackling the life of NT.
I know some pretty qualified people have written about Einstein -- can anyone suggest a bio of NT written by, say, a phd physicist? If not, sounds like a real opportunity for someone.

Well, the risk besides confiscation of wallets which you seem to be implying is not much a of risk, is of course decline in the value of BTC.

Huh? I think that was the part that indicated he was not very sophisticated.
It was suggested that his world view was in part formed by his McGuffey reader which, though standard issue in the USA in the 19th century, had anti-semitic overtones. (Specific example of which I would be interested in seeing.)
In the 19th century, it was very common to be openly anti-semitic. Ironically, William Lloyd Garrison the abolitionist, was one of those who expressed anti-Jewish sentiments.
Edison was another antisemite as was Tesla I think. Ford not being one would have been surprising but he was just very loud about it.

There have been attempts to create competing currencies that the government stopped -- not BTC obviously (yet).
I agree, just cause one branch of the gov stands to benefit from the sale doesn't mean that another will not undermine them -- happens all the time. Nonetheless, I find it hard to believe a large, official sale of BTC by a government agency will not be accompanied by some sort of assurances that the BTC are completely legal to own. They will have obtained official backing for making such a statement.
Any other scenario (lacking such assurances) seems unlikely to me. We'll have to see.

What I really object to about inflation is the helplessness of older folks who thought that saving money would give them a chance to retire. They deprived themselves when they were young only to discover that the cash they had put aside had been devalued so that it did not have the buying power to support them in their old age.
An old age in which working would be impossible -- society was structured for old people to be retired. Now that is far from a given.
Is it right or wrong or just the way things are? I don't know. If you prevent inflation, if you create a system where money can't be created by fiat, would it work? I don't know. But I do know many people are finding out they are in big trouble with no way out.

A professor at Cornell pointed out something I thought was very important:
If the bug in BTC that hackers exploited was the malleability thing, this could in no way account for the number of BTC that Gox says they lost.
If you can say you didn't receive coins when in fact you did, that still would require you to contact Gox and interact via email or phone with a human -- this would be noticed by customer service at Gox, no?
So: 
1. Is this the bug that Gox is saying caused the huge loss?
2. If so, do you agree with what the  Cornell prof. said, assuming I am paraphrasing accurately?
If "yes" to both, Gox is lying. or very confused and lost the money without even now understanding how.

As people are saying, paradoxically, stability leads to increases.
But the way that could really work is long periods of stability maybe make people confident enough to buy or hold if a retailer and that should make the price move up, maybe to another plateau.

The sort of transactions I am thinking of would not show up in the R-BTC figures -- they would buy in cash from individuals who maybe already had BTC and then sell for dollars which in fact would cause exactly what we are seeing.

No, the voting clearly would not be done by the parties directly involved. I could not have meant that richer holders would always win in legal disputes and that is an absurd inference.

How does anyone having a bunch of money negatively affect others? 
One way is, say, they buy the entire supply of a rare and life-saving drug and destroy it.

I think that the easiest way for an employer to utilize Bitcoin is to pay optional bonuses, not wages, in Bitcoin.
There are indeed an incredible amount of regulation around wages that it is probably not worth it to try to pay wages/salary in BTC. One obvious problem comes to mind: You've paid wages in BTC and a drop (not necessarily a big one) in BTC exchange rate makes what you paid in the preceding year not constitute minimum wage for the employee. A company would almost certainly have to come up with the difference. This is both expensive if that happens and expensive to keep track of.
However, I don't think bonuses would have this problem at all since things like stock options of course fluctuate often and by large amounts.

It would be better if a different mechanism than law enforcement could have been used to protect BTC.
A technical solution rather getting mixed up the Feds?
Why the Feds?? Why a USA law enforcement agency?
I hope they do not end up regretting this.
Think about policing ourselves (BTC holders being "ourselves" ).

I after getting a gig that I really needed started having trouble with vision.

I also worry about dementia or even carpal tunnel. All these kind of things make having years of experience more or less meaningless.

It seems to me that it has already succeeded: transactions continue to be made and I would guess there are companies that are beginning to not only accept BTC but have suppliers who accept it.
It feels like enough transactions have occurred to prove that it works and it has certainly weathered some PR disasters.
The threat of countries making it illegal exists but like the Internet, it does not exist in any one place.
Your definition of failure is its price going to zero which seems virtually impossible. It could go way lower but why would it as long as the number of transactions continues to grow?
Summary: Bitcoin has already proven itself.

You are saying simply that they got paid in BTC but owe fiat and have therefore liquidated.

As I understand it, the current way of creating money solved a problem that could not be solved with the antique system (essentially gold-backed money) in place prior to it.
But that does not mean that a newer system based upon computing+internet+other stuff might not solve the same problems in a better way.
It seems wrong to me to penalize people for saving money (penalize via inflation) -- if there is a way to allow people to retain much of the value of their savings while at the same time allowing complex international activity, that would be great.
I am not sure if Bitcoin is it (I am no economist) but isn't it barely possible that our current system is not the last word on money?

So how much is saved on no need for security to protect cash?
There is of course still a need for security but without cash boxes on every table, there is probably a need for less.
You would get the same effect with credit cards only, too but then you would have credit card fees.
In general, can one compare costs of such a fair compared to one that accepts cash and/or credit cards?

The fact that the thief could spend the coins at an innocent third party is the same sort of problem that happens with any sort of currency. The legitimate owner must still be vigilant.
It would be sufficient if *most* of the time a thief could be prevented from spending stolen coins. If there was also a chance that they could be identified and prosecuted (if it is all handled in BTC-land, the penalty could be a fine) then thefts would drop dramatically.

If someone offered you a house for sub-market value, would you not buy? Market manipulation may be attempted but it can only do so much.

It's only a fortune if they choose to do it in such a way; but they could empirically determine how many times percentage-wise people ask for refunds and try to keep a sufficient number of BTC on hand (i.e., not convert to bucks) to cover it.
What I would bet is that if they have an automatic conversion policy now they will end up revising it to a policy that is different.

Nonetheless, until about a year ago, there had been no attempt to regulate Bitcoin by the Feds -- they were scarcely aware of it.
Maybe a Bitcoin that quietly did what it used to do was the way to go. Or maybe mainstreaming it is the way for it to become really valuable. 
I sure don't know.
@_date: 2014-03-09 20:51:05
You are saying the form of the regulation might be government-imposed insurance.
Three things:
1. If so, better that BTC itself handles this
2. Not sure how this insurance will work: FDIC insurance was for bank failures, not theft as I understand it although maybe for that. If it is theft insurance there obviously will be a lot of associated bureaucracy for claims, etc.
3. I suspect Congress will impose other things besides an insurance requirement; maybe terrible, Bitcoin-destroying things...
So I don't know what can or should be done to avoid the terrible things I am certain will happen if Congress (or whoever) gets involved.

You say "Then.." What are you referring to by that?
Let me restate:
In order to avoid money laundering (which very few of us are involved in) we have to use banks who presumably would detect this. Therefore we pay a fee for every transaction even though virtually fee-free alternatives exist. (e.g. Bitcoin)
Point out the nonsense, smart guy.

It may be that there are things not anticipated -- almost certainly.
When automobiles were first introduced the changes to society eventually were huge and various but not immediately obvious.
Just making transactions less expensive makes businesses that would have been impossible (but imaginable if you thought hard enough in that direction, I guess) possible.
But there are more things than cheaper cash transfer.

"In reality, it's not..." is an opinion as you well know.
My opinion, shared by many others I think, is that BTC are pretty much worth either essentially nothing or quite a lot. I would guess that a professional theoretical economist (this is probably a rare individual) would have some way of determining within a very broad range a price.
Probably the number if transactions per day and number of different holders would be important parts of any formula for determining value. (As many others have stated.)

I think you bring up a good point: in the long run, the more vendors who accept BTC, the better.
But in the short run, especially when they tend to convert to fiat as most are, it will tend to depress prices. But eventually, and I think soon, the concerns about BTC that make big companies liquidate will go away or diminish.
Every vendor increases the likelihood of other vendors hanging onto BTC -- as mentioned before, maybe Overstock employees ask for bonuses in BTC and use them to pay their Dish bills.
And there is that Malaysian company that says they intend to hold on to their coins.

If you are saying, we don't get the number of BTC we paid initially unless the price remains the same, I agree with you.

Even if he doesn't donate anything to helping Bitcoin spread, it sure seems to me that he has already done a lot.

@_date: 2014-07-08 09:54:12
But BTC is being criticized for being a way to fund illegal activities.
The dollar's main failing: the requirement for banks to handle transactions, is its greatest strength from a LE standpoint. (Tell me if the foregoing is wrong.)
**This is terrible: We have banks imposed upon us, costing us for every effing transaction just to prevent the miniscule portion of illegal transactions from happening?**
If that ends up being the remaining reason for most people to use banks, that just sucks. It is not fair to charge law-abiding people fees to interfere with a very few criminals, without much success anyhow.
Can we simply argue that we do not need regulation to prevent illegal transaction since such transactions A. Are very small portion of all transactions and B. Illegal activity existed before BTC and will exist after BTC if you fucks manage to outlaw it or constrain it so badly no one wants to use it?

As in conventional banking, they loan BTC to someone with collateral.
That person pays them back plus interest, a portion of which you the depositor receive -- why is this necessarily a scam?

Here's what I really wanted to ask: My understanding about lending is one in which this fractional reserve banking is not central or even necessarily involved: It is I have a not-very-liquid asset like a house or a car and you have cash. I want to buy something from someone who want cash, so you lend it to me collateralized by the house.
I pay it back eventually from money from my salary or worst case by selling my collateral.
How come BTC doesn't work for this?
@_date: 2014-06-23 11:46:08
I think that it is simplistic to try to find uses for Bitcoin in areas "other than money" -- instead one should realize how fundamental to existence is the idea of doing something and being remunerated for it.
Animals like monkeys and some birds get this idea in experiments. It happens in some respect (and this is maybe a stretch) even between humans and micro-organisms in symbiotic relationships.
Therefore, something that simplifies, expedites, makes more efficient the exchange of value is likely to have far-reaching, fundamental (and positive) effects on the world.

BTC: fiat is the same roughly as fiat : gold. That's right, gold, as much as I love its look and feel, is not suitable for an international hi-tech economy; fiat more suitable but why shouldn't fiat have a successor?

It seems almost impossible that a better coin is not possible. But history is important. 
For example, in chess people have come up with "better" versions. For example, a world class player with White I think can make it very hard for the number one player with Black to win if White plays from the outset for a draw. They wanted to deal with the "draw death " of chess and developed variants.
But none of these caught on. Maybe a strained analogy.
Also, of course, BTC keeps improving and I would guess has more resources to do so than some upstart.

That point about the premium being "really small" is false; it is a significant percentage of the interest rate you receive. Frankly, you sound like someone who sells insurance.
I am for protection of consumers but making them pay for insurance is inferior to things like making sure that bad actors in the industry have their behavior publicized, etc.
An interesting scenario to me about insurance was probably one of the first insurers: The companies that insured ships. I think in those cases, the owner of the ship likely had a single ship and if he lost that (which probably happened a lot) he was screwed.
I think he had the alternative of selling shares in the ship (or the proceeds of the voyage) so that he made less but also was not screwed. Alternatively, maybe if no one wanted to buy shares, he could pay for insurance so that he wouldn't be screwed if he lost the ship AND the insurer paid off (which doesn't always happen).
The salient point is, the all-or-nothing nature of a ship in the cases of ship owners with all their wealth tied up in a single ship.
But with almost anything else, you can achieve the same "protection" simply by not putting more money than you can afford to lose into, for example, BTC.
Please honestly tell me if you are an insurance salesman or the seller of equivalent instruments.

On a basic principle, that money has not fundamentally changed in a long time and the advent of internet places so many new requirements on money that developed long ago it would be absolutely amazing if somehow it still worked, I have to agree with you without even thinking too hard about it.

You've a point there indeed.
Money really is magic by the Arthur Clarke definition of magic -- at least to me.

If they have to pay capital gains on BTC this would be if the BTC had indeed appreciated since the coins were received. This is a good problem for a business to have.
They can also convert BTC into cash immediately which avoids this problem.
Bitcoin miners are the ones who have a taxable event when the coins are mined but even they can offset this with cost of mining rigs and power.
But anyhow, I don't see BTC for merchants being that big of a deal compared to maintaining the huge numbers of security staff that I saw on Vice.

Banks have limited insurance and of course you pay for it. And money-printing is a kind of theft, isn't it?
Disregarding the insurance issue and even the comparison between dollars and BTC, the important thing that should be included in articles about Mt. Gox is that the reason the theft could occur is,
**People left all their coins there rather than putting them in their own wallets!**
And a BTC wallet is not like a physical wallet that can be stolen.
I would like to see that mentioned in articles about the Mt. Gox theft. Definitely I would.

Maybe key is to not be concerned about *all* of your suppliers accepting *all* payments in BTC; wouldn't a gradual approach work?
I know that in Overstock's case, there are so many tax and accounting concerns that they are strongly motivated to remove the risk of holding BTC as soon as possible. But if your employees are willing to accept Bitcoins as bonuses -- agreeing to do so irrespective of movement of the exchange rate -- than some portion of the BTC O receives may be set aside.
This bonus idea is nothing I have read about regarding Overstock but just a guess. Is your company trying anything like that internally?

Giving the BTC to employees as bonuses means less coins that have to be converted to fiat. Of course the employees can convert but they, choosing to receive bonuses in BTC, may not want to and even if they do, it may take longer. (Like, the coins stay unconverted in O's coffers until xmas rather than immediate conversion.)
Surely it would be better of O were very successful but their lack of success as a company does not have direct bearing on BTC and it is a pioneering effort that may persuade other firms to try it.
If you use the word "nutter" rather than crazy, I bet you are not an American -- if you are, that is a similar courageous pioneering effort.

I simply bought my first BTC through Coinbase. So far I have
1. Bought using my linked bank account
2. Sold with the proceeds going back into that account
In both cases, I lost on fees and bid/ask spread.
My next transaction will most likely be, after deciding upon what kind of wallet to create, moving some of those BTC into that wallet. If that is without any fee, that is great.
I may also try to pay for something using BTC at Coinbase and I assume that is, as far as Coinbase is concerned, the same as moving BTC into my own (non-Coinbase) wallet. So paying for stuff using BTC held at Coinbase might also be fee-less.
@_date: 2014-07-02 05:46:35
I think things like:

2. Number of transactions
3. How many companies accept it and how many of them might be paying their employees and suppliers in it so that conversion to fiat instantly doesn't happen -- companies that do this make me sad for of course this makes Bitcoin only a gimmick but I think more and more companies are retaining some percentage of their BTC

By "not working" do you mean that there is a problem with accepting BTC? If so, you have a point.
But if by "not working" you mean it is not adding directly to the sales of Dish, that doesn't mean much.
If not "not working" means that a company can successfully accept payment from a customer, this is a very good thing for BTC. It means that it can be done from both a regulatory and technical standpoint and eventually *if* more people decide they want to pay for things with BTC, then it will be useful to accept BTC, something which Dish and O and Tiger and that Malaysian company are demonstrating.
That's it from me on this topic.

I assume you are being ironic, but frankly my opinion in general is sort of that.
At one time the vote in England was only for property owners; why is it obvious that everyone should have an equal vote in for example, presidential elections?
In my condo complex, if you owned more than one unit you got more than one vote. (You had a bigger stake not necessarily better judgement.
Anyway, it is extremely unlikely that one person/one vote law will ever change in the USA or elsewhere but as far as a self-regulating BTC voting system, I can think of no better suggestion. 
In US presidential elections, you can argue that rich people don't actually have a bigger stake in the outcome. But in the BTC case, your stake in the outcome of votes is in fact proportional to the number of BTC you hold and big holders would want cases adjudicated fairly since bad decisions would tend to lower the value of their holdings.

I have always found the discussion of the value of the dollar over time fascinating in various ways:
1. It is quaint to read about railway workers in the 19th century striking for an extra buck a month or something and other examples of prices being crazily low
2. The dollar has sometimes remained stable for long periods of time and even gone up
3. Comparisons are complex since when you say you could buy a car for 800 bucks in 1920 obviously the car by almost any measure was inferior. Same with virtually anything you could mention. Interesting exception: cost of telephone calls wildly cheaper today for much better service than 90 years ago.
4. I am not sure that inflation is not somewhat necessary and I wonder how this might play out with Bitcoin which I have about two months takehome pay invested in. Can a currency that rewards holders work to power an economy that requires investment capital? A profound question.
I feel intuitively that keeping money under a mattress vs investing it should have some penalty. Investors get more dollars of lesser value but the diminution in value is made up for by getting a lot more of them. Why should a holder, doing nothing with their dollars get appreciation? On the other hand, why should they in fact lose buying power? Anyway, too much for me but another year should tell us an awful lot about the long-term direction of BTC -- it is almost inconceivable to me that a year from now the situation: price, regulation, number of users won't be radically different.

I think you are wrong. I will give you one phrase generating approach that I may even use after I tell you.
I used to live in Wyoming. In first grade (I have an amazing memory) there were 6 boys and 4 girls in my class. I remember all of their names and that of my teacher.
Two years later my family moved to Idaho. I can do the same thing with  my third grade. 
I can choose some subset of these names, maybe alphabetically. I can shift the letters of some of the names, maybe the girls by N letters. 
Without saying what N is or how big the subset is, I would be willing to store 3 BTC at an addess generated in this way.

That government guarantee is simply insurance -- it is not free.
A similar guarantee could be created but it is not magic -- it comes at a cost and it is limited to a certain amount (last time I checked, 100k).
So I am looking for an interest rate with a reasonable expectation of being able to get my money out. Not guaranteed but not an outright scam.
I see the problems such "banks" would currently have is being able to do all the things associated with lending; in particular, obtain legal title to collateral in case of foreclosure. Maybe literally zero such institutions currently exist.
But I don't see why they couldn't. The collateral might have to be physical, like gold. Maybe pinkslips on cars.

Given that *some* people are there (at the coffee shop or pot dispensary, the latter being the biggie) because of BTC, an expert hanging out there to answer questions will probably have some business.
His potential customers are maybe somewhat technical; but BTC is a sea in which an elephant may swim or a gnat drink. (This I think was a description of chess -- beginners can enjoy it but it can take a lifetime or more to master.) 
So it is not hard for me to imagine an extremely sharp BTC person being able to rustle up some business near a pot dispensary in many different ways; an obvious thing is simply helping buyers and sellers change money for BTC or being a buyer or a seller. (Some of this may be quasi illegal but if done discreetly and no one gets cheated, it should be fine.)

It seems like people are saying that a technology/app that uses *a* blockchain can exist without Bitcoin but a technology/app that uses *the* Blockchain is indeed dependent upon Bitcoin to remunerate the miners.
Even in the former case, some sort of incentive must exist. It may not be Bitcoin. Could the current Blockchain ever stop using Bitcoin as the incentive? No physical reason why not but is it at all likely given that miners are probably all supporters of Bitcoin.

I think that rewarding Blockchain maintainers with Bitcoin specifically is intrinsic to the Bitcoin system. An alternative to this could be devised, including fiat or another crypto or a physical pat on the back from, say, The President of the United States.

So those who want the Blockchain are probably stuck with Bitcoin.

I am very happy to now have the BTC in a place where I can always get to them.
My lingering fear (which people I think are deliberately trying to foster) is that they are not completely safe although I was careful and am a computer programmer for a living.
The reason for people fostering fear is (I speculate) because of either being completely anti-Bitcoin (and making people afraid that for some mysterious reason one's coins are always at risk is certainly a good way to make non-technical people especially to just throw up their hands and keep their money elsewhere) or because they want people to keep their coins in an online wallet or use some other technology.

I have to check out the site but without doing so, I visualize the amazing effectiveness psychologically of prices quoted in BTC with reference to dollars (or other fiat).
As long as people keep thinking in terms of exchange rate, fiat remains primary in people's minds and BTC sort of a curiosity; Overstock could experiment at very little risk since they can simply stop doing this if problems arise.
I wonder if Byrne underestimates the significance of such a move. (Or maybe I am overestimating...)

They could also do not of this in secret.

It also means that fewer BTC are sold for fiat and each sale pushes the price down a little.

Since there is no real equivalence between an ounce of gold a Bitcoin, this would be purely psychological. But I'll take it.

I wondered how close to reality that movie was. I will post again my NYC story: My landlord was giving me a very hard time when I broke my lease, making me find another renter and having me be responsible if the new renter did not stay for the final 5 months of my 2 year lease.
A doorman said, in paraphrase, "You are being really nice about this -- another tenant did not pay for a full year at 2500/month (this was 1994 or so) and finally said he would move out for 4k -- they settled on 2k so the guy stole 32k from the landlord."
@_date: 2014-01-06 12:23:31
I am just saying that if you take the total volume in BTC of transactions, taking into account the total number of distinct users, does this in some way contribute to the value of BTC?
So far, since both these numbers are increasing, and the value of BTC has been going up, what I am suggesting seems to be true.
But the main thing I am saying is, now that I think more about it, a newly introduced competing crypto-currency has the credibility/good will established by these numbers to overcome.

Yes, that is huge: merchants being able to pay other merchants with BTC. This is becoming more possible.
Overstock mentioned paying **bonuses** (not salaries) in BTC. This is huge. I knew that bonuses would be the only possibility due to regulations associated with pay.
Note that a merchant can avoid converting BTC to fiat if only one of its suppliers accepts BTC as long as that supplier is a big enough part of the company's expenses.  Like in the case of Overstock and Dish -- I could see people happily paying their Dish bill in BTC and Dish employees happily buying stuff from O. 
This could in fact be automated: **A business opportunity** for entrepreneurs -- set a up a general system for BtoB recurrent payments.

I think there is an attempt to affect price. I see (on Blockchain.info) bigger trades at relatively higher prices than subsequent trades of very small amounts (.01 BTC). This has the effect indeed of making the more recent quote lower than it might otherwise be but I can't see how it can really affect price in any significant way: if .01 BTC is sold at 469 but the last time someone bought 4 BTC it was as 472 than any short covering will tend to occur at the higher price.
Summary: If what I have just described is manipulation, it is not very sophisticated.
I think the price will be driven by demand for things that can only be bought using BTC (or that it is advantageous to use BTC): Online poker, BTC ATMs, remittances. One thing for sure, volume is growing pretty strongly.

Good point -- I don't think that Chinese are selling at all but people are worried that they will slow significantly their future purchases.
So I would guess that Chinese are buying all they can and trying to figure out how to keep doing so -- if you want to move money out of a country, even paying a premium is worth it. So I think speculators have driver price down, not liquidations.
Tangentially related: I have many times mused about the awkwardness of money:
Bear in mind that a 100 weighs exactly 1 gram. So 10 thousand of them weigh 22 pounds or so, even a little old lady can probably manage a million bucks worth. But around 2 mill, she can't.
Some movies and real-life things about moving money:
1. I read that drug dealers bury money and find often that it has rotted. Total loss since you can't try to get the bills replaced by the treasury. (Sir, we're just having trouble understanding why you have 10,000 rotting hundreds. Unless, &lt;chuckling&gt; you happen to be a drug dealer...)
2. Stupid movie where scientists are given a billion dollars in cash. That weighs 10 tons, I think.
3. Diamonds: You will lose maybe 50% or more when you sell
4. Casino chips -- probably for large denomination (25k chips) the casino can just selectively make chips worthless so even an intermediary will not be able to sell them back.
5. Bank transfers: oh, no problem there.
It seems clear to me that Chinese really, really need BTC. But dig this: I am betting corruption is so widespread that China really doesn't want to do anything really that will make BTC worthless -- what we are seeing is smoke and mirrors.

I don't think anyone objecting to BTC on the basis that it is used for crime are sincere -- this is basically the Shelly Adelson reasoning for online poker being illegal too.
BTC is infringing on Western Union and bank territory and they don't like and they will say anything. WU was left without its traditional product (telegrams altho of course they saw that coming). Remittance is huge for WU and they are in a fight for their lives or will be if BTC begins to make inroads there which I think is happening.

Another central idea, to me, is that if it is worth anything it ought to be worth a lot. I am impressed that the exchange rate has been at a "fairly high" number for a very long period of time despite scandals and threats.

Well, without resorting  to analogy, I know there are rules that attempt to prevent market manipulation but I contend that in the long run, such rules can't really influence the price of a company although in the short run, of course they can.
Milton Friedman felt that many rules that currently are in place should be thrown out and investors, knowing that they are not "protected" anymore by such rules should act accordingly.
I agree strongly because the rules do not seem particularly effective but are expensive to enforce. Friedman thought that trading on inside information should be allowed and I think the rationale behind this, which I find compelling, is that insider trading goes on all the time despite such rules.
Anyway, if people attempt to make the price of BTC go down by selling at bargain rates, I say, buy the coins. Would you make illegal people buying BTC at higher than market rate? (I don't think the conventional exchanges have rules against bidding UP the price of shares; only shorting is regulated in this respect.)

However, making money because of a good idea seems okay to me; defrauding people is not. I don't think Allaire is trying however to defraud people -- I think he really believes in it.

No, the volume has not dwindled to nothing. What do you mean?
Number of transactions is a simplistic measure if you look at it alone. I think a point is: if companies that accept BTC convert immediately to fiat, this generates additional transactions; if the transactions diminish, it may to a certain extent reflect less to fiat conversion -- a good thing.
@_date: 2014-12-11 17:43:59
When they buy from MSFT, it is MSFT who probably often converts to fiat (that is, sells).  So the price reflects both the very good news of credibility along with the realistic aspect that more BTC might be sold than were previously.
But as I indicated, plenty of people will have more confidence in BTC because of MSFT and choose to hold or even buy more. MSFT may also hold on to BTC they receive -- the details can't be known but in a while we might see a major rise if various good things happen.

Without me making any specific recommendation, it has to be someone with a reputation that they will not sacrifice or compromise just to defraud you of a relatively small number of Bitcoins. This is for online.
As far as in-person transactions:
I needed to raise money while out of town and met fellow BTCers. Before I met them in person, I guessed we could do the transactions incrementally so the most I could lose was, say, .5 BTC. As it happened, I could tell upon meeting them in person that there would be no problem so I just sent the two BTC and they paid when they received the coins. I did 2 BTC transactions twice with two different people this way.
Had it been for more coin, like 10, I would have relied upon the incremental approach. So why can't you meet a person in public and try this?

I think the primary source of dirty money is drugs being illegal -- but most of us do not deal in drugs. So should the rest of us law-abiders be penalized because some would try to launder money?

The thing is to develop applications where BTC is advantageous or necessary to use. Frankly, I am not going to just buy BTC just to spend them when I could just buy the good directly.
On the other hand, employees of Overstock and MSFT may be getting bonuses in BTC and they *are* probably spending them or maybe simply fiating them in. (I just coined term "fiating" maybe.) It would I think be better for the price of BTC if they did keep them as an investment, no?

2. I am not unconcerned about the key logger and all sorts of cleverness such as retaining keys even offline and sending them later.

I don't see how his being a "nutter" (Explanation: sanswork is from UK and this is their word for crazy.) has much bearing: O is a publicly-traded company accepting Bitcoin.
If they start retaining more than 10%, then conversion to fiat (which is bad both for the price of BTC and more generally for it credibility) should diminish.
I like the employee bonus idea since it will probably be copied by other BTC-accepting companies -- Overstock and others would prefer to not have to convert at all.
**A really big step would be to price some of its inventory in BTC, keeping prices steady even if the exchange rate changes. This will show a real commitment to Bitcoin and of course can always be discontinued.**

If you exclude all external government law enforcement, then such companies will show they are trustworthy in other ways: track record of owners, putting funds in escrow, etc.
I have no confidence in government regulation because it is both expensive and ineffective. A company legally declare bankruptcy and you can whistle all you want for your money.

Thinking more about bank loans:
Just how much of the current process: meeting with a loan officer, proving collateral, etc. can either be dispensed with or automated?
Is this something that will really always require direct human interaction or can obtaining loans actually be automated?
Imagine the threat to traditional banks if it could be: I would guess the lion's share of the reason for expensive branches is in fact infrastructure for their loan departments.
But maybe collateral is not that important; maybe only a credit rating might work. On the other hand, why couldn't you prove ownership online of things like a car or house?
There might be a need for an actual third party but there may be ways for this "bank" to have much less overhead than traditional banks.
To what extent would Bitcoin itself be able to facilitate this? Does it make sense to have a BTC-specific credit score?

The Bitcoin relationship is the idea that Bitcoin lacks conventional regulation and therefore it is not safe (as was asserted in the article not about BTC but about Kickstarter).
My point is, not only does conventional regulation not do much in some (all/many) cases, but we can regulate ourselves and by "we" I mean users of BTC, Kickstarter, Aibbnd, and so forth.

If the price had gone up a lot making it "the best investment of 2014" then we would see the price as being too high. These sort of assessments based purely on price are simplistic.

The big question I really have is whether the apparent attempts to influence price by making very small trades really works or is based on a misconception.
It sure looks like margin calls are influenced not by average price but last price -- that would explain the patterns I see but of course, these guys either are wrong or are trying to not  cause/avoid margin calls but rather to influence the behavior of other traders.

It is not a gamble in the sense that its value is moved by chance like dice or a roulette wheel. 
There are risks, like another Gox or government intervention (although it would have to be all governments and that won't happen.)
But one thing for sure: BTC offers functionality. It will really help people someday. The banking for people with only a cell phone is an advantage hard to grasp if you banks for granted.
But if you have ever for say credit reasons been cut off from the services of a bank, you are screwed. You won't be able to rent or do nothing. Without a credit card even with cash, I think some hotels will just pretend they are sold out.
I assume that Africa and other places where people don't have bank access in many cases it is not as critical; but if some of these countries want to move forward financially, banking services *without a bank* may be just the thing they need.

Sounds like with BTC being the funding method, the teeth has been taken out of their ability to enforce their law against sites. Again SWC is able to proceed.
The only *good* reason I read here is voluntary compliance with asinine law in exchange for US players being legally allowed to play in the future.
Although you argue that playing is not illegal only funding is, so I am basically confused by your post.

I think the rally starts happening as O and Dish start paying their employee bonuses in BTC (as Byrne suggested they might). In this way, fewer BTC get converted to fiat which is absolutely essential for a real run up in usage.
Elsewhere I saw the idea that O employees start paying their Dish bills in BTC -- that could happen, right? O avoids the overhead of the fiat conversion, Disk maybe gets some new customers who pay in an efficient way. Win/Win/Win. (The third "Win" is for BTC itself.)

Well, one thing for sure is that all this supposed protection that conventional banks offer comes at a significant price.
The monthly fees for some people would be a big percentage of their balance. This is a form of theft.
As is the printing by the government of new bills. 
So basically, *your fiat is not safe at all* you in fact are being stolen from regularly.
You failed to address this.
With a properly-secured BTC wallet, you will *never* be stolen from. Never vs monthly; I'll take the former.
This is the sort of thing that it would be fair to mention in Mt. Gox fiasco-covering articles.

I wouldn't have the government make any rules.
But I don't see why the possibility of dealing with theft can't be part of the system. I think an objection is, who gets to decide whether theft has occurred or not, but perhaps this could be done by the alleged victim presenting their case and opening up to a vote of all BTC holders, with votes allocated in proportion to BTC holdings.
I am sure the last part of votes proportional to holdings of BTC will bother some people but I can see no other way.

One of the biggest problems was I lost perspective: I now only had my salary and it didn't seem like much (it wasn't much) compared to the amount I had had so I did some stupid things, playing catch up.
Eventually I became unemployed and essentially homeless, living on handouts and I was no longer a young person. You can't imagine how scared I was.
But I am now to my own surprise doing okay again and I take pleasure and satisfaction in having bounced back somewhat.
So maybe you have to accept your current situation as a challenge. You won't be the first person to have had a disaster and come back to great success -- you will really appreciate it more, I promise. Use the disaster as a motivator. I know I waste a lot less time than I used to.
And I bet you are a lot younger than I am. I sure hope so, because the statistics at my age are not the best. If you are still employed, you are ahead of where I was.

I may be wrong, but even a single company doing this begins to create an  ecosystem where BTC can be used instead of fiat.
As I mentioned before, it could Dish and Overstock giving bonuses to employees in BTC and those employees start paying their Dish bills using BTC and Dish employees buy from O using these bonuses.
I think this is a big deal, especially if this Malaysian company actually sees profit from this activity. I wish them well.

Wealth gap is not a problem in today's world -- poverty is a problem but it is not caused by the wealth gap. Probably poverty is caused in part by simplistic attempts to close the wealth gap.
But already off-topic, I'm afraid. One final OT thought: a person just over the poverty level in the USA (or maybe slightly below it) lives better than Napoleon in almost every important respect.

If by "nutter" you mean to imply unintelligent or incompetent, I don't know where you get this from.
Also, when someone has a strong opinion about BTC, I think a fair question is, "What are your qualifications?" I have expressed no strong opinions; I have I think positions based on fact. But even though you did not ask, I am a developer for a very large investment firm with many years experience in retail brokerage.
But I never know here whether I am speaking to an economist or a sixteen year old hired to post nonsense. (I am not saying that I think this in your case, BTW.)

There is something very compelling about predicting price from past performance. I don't believe it and think it is an idea foisted upon the public by retail brokerages who want to encourage people to day trade.
If the price is based on the number of people using it or the value of the amount of goods bought with it, what do you think the effect of new ATMs opening in many locations is?
Of what they are doing in Cyprus?
Of Ukrainians worried about the value of their currency?
I would never buy gold, way too heavy, if I were trying to move money out of my country's currency. I might buy dollars; I might buy BTC; for sure I would be buying something.

Why does this make BTC centralized? It is one crime victim putting a crime to vote by every holder, not a central committee.
It occurs to me that the value of the crime might determine where in the queue the crime is places except this has the obvious problem of someone misrepresenting the value.
Also, who is the victim? I mean, how is the victim identified?
Anyway, technical problems far above my ability to solve but I still feel if the choice is BTC holders vs the governments of multiple nations (which btw seems to present a huge regulatory problem -- which nations get to decide for an international currency?) I sure would want it to be BTC holders.
And this is not purely a theoretical problem, obviously. It seems like BTC community should get on this in order to preempt such governmental regulation.
Imagination if somehow this Gox fiasco could have been quietly handled, or handled in such a way that it demonstrated the fairness of BTC! That would show how BTC could kick the ass of fiat in this respect where people permanently lose money every day.

@_date: 2014-03-04 08:29:31
I won't; there is no free lunch. Unless I believe the price of the insurance is lower than my expected losses from theft or whatever, I won't pay it.
In other words, if the insurer is offering a good bet (which they can't and make money) I will take the risk. 
I will use good practice, not insurance to mitigate the risk. That is, I will, for example, not keep all my BTC in one place, etc.  A lot cheaper than insurance.

And then, as in Pacific Heights, they can sue you.
The law is so screwed up.
In California, you can be fired from a job with no notice, I think (usually you get notice, however). If that is true, why is getting rid of a renter, for any reason whatsoever, let alone non-payment of rent, such a big deal? 
The renter's protection laws don't help renters -- they only help renters who already have a rental. But again, this screwed up situation is due to regulations -- **isn't it better to have no regulations and just pass information about bad potential users of services? These guys will never screw over anyone else who bothers looking them up.**

Moreover, do banks deserve to become rich from remittances? Does Western Union?

Well, if all you say is true, is of extreme importance. If they can proceed profitably even when it is known what they are doing, there is a big problem.
Of course, a strict requirement for them is that BTC trades above zero; even a very precipitous drop in price (more than 50%) would affect them adversely if they were not able to also short?
Anyhow, I expect others to agree or disagree strongly since you seem to be describing something seriously bad.

What do you mean? I too think the rules are exact but possibly hard to explain or deliberately not specified.
For equities, margin took into account volatility of the stock, market price (cheap stocks required more margin) and maybe volume. 
Similar things might enter into their calculations for Bitcoin. But what I find hard to believe is that if BTC traded at 400 all day and then some low volume trading occurs at 390 at the end of the day, these prices mean as much as the earlier high volume trades with regard to a margin call. (Say the guy had shorted at 395 and so he wants the price to stay below this to avoid a margin call -- does he think that Bitfinex won't ask for more cash just because of .05 BTC being sold at 390?)

I think that you would have to liquidate in order to be liable for taxes on profits or able to claim a loss against, say, stock market profits.
It is profoundly unfair to tax upon unrealized gains since there is no evidence that you can actually sell at market price and the Feds do not do this in any situation I can think of.

@_date: 2014-02-25 10:22:43

@_date: 2014-03-29 04:41:44
Wait, you are saying, "That is the policy." I think the policy means that the miner having received a coin for "free" (minus mining costs) owes taxes for that amount at mining time.
If he subsequently sells or uses the BTC to make a purchase, he may owe further taxes if the price goes up.
But if the price goes down, since his cost basis is still zero, there is no loss that can be deducted. 
Is the above your understanding also?

Yes, it is sort of a weird argument, I know.
There is at least one scenario I can think of that would make me buy now rather than waiting because I wanted the security of having this kind of asset. Even if I knew 100% it would drop significantly soon.
If there was any reason whatsoever that I would not be able to buy in a year (and who knows the future), even if it was cheaper, I would still rather take the hit just to be able to have such a flexible asset. In another thread I mention Havana with Robert Redford -- I always thought I would want a diamond like that altho even finding a doctor to do it would be hard.

It is significant whether vendors convert or do not convert to fiat. In the idealized scenario of no conversion to (only from) fiat, BTC would account for an ever-increasing slice of the economic pie. But if every BTC received is converted to fiat, there is no such increase in pie size.
Of course that a vendor accept BTC means more people will tend to accept BTC themselves, so, yes, that is good.
**If you have an agreement with a supplier and/or employee to accept BTC irrespective of exchange rate then you have removed the risk of volatility for that amount of BTC.**

I am not following you. You are saying take a little bit of profit by holding on in order to sell after it has gone up?
I would think the motivation for any business accepting BTC to not convert to fiat is to avoid the cost of that conversion.

How big of a difference?
The price you may be seeing on google is last trade but on coinbase you will pay "ask" plus a small (.5% I think) commission.
Also, I would guess that a bunch of very small BTC trades don't affect the price that coinbase offers as much a large trades.
**Summary: Yes, Coinbase has its own way of calculating the price it charges you and the price it buys from you at.**

My understanding of merchants causing downward pressure is that they tended to as fast as they could sell for cash as part of their business model for using BTC. And they who bought that BTC (Coinbase, for example) would also try to sell that BTC.
If you sold your coin to an investor, that BTC might remain "dormant" for a very long time.
When merchants start also to hang onto BTC or at least pay for things with BTC rather than fiat, then we will get the effect of both larger adoption AND more coins remaining dormant. Without merchants, the utility value of BTC would go to zero -- with them you had more trades for fiat but as mentioned, this may diminish.
The ultimate would be ALL merchants accepting BTC (to the exclusion of fiat) and none trading for fiat since they don't have to and other merchants won't accept fiat. Then the crazy predictions for valuation **would** occur but not accepting fiat is probably never going to happen.
But if merchants preferentially accepted BTC or some merchants (like online poker) accepted BTC only, you would still see a huge rise in the BTC vs fiat price.

I believe a huge factor is Russians trying to move assets out of the country (which is being restricted, I think) and BTC is a great way to do so. Unfortunately, many of them immediately sell their just-acquired BTC for fiat.
This is my guess and why I have been buying BTC. Because if any sales not necessarily all of BTC are due to this phenomenon, the current price feels like a bargain.

1. Telephone: Watson told Bell to forget about the phone until he finished the "Harmonic Telegraph"
2. Airplane: Kelvin said in like 1900 that it would never happen

Why would a manipulator want to keep the price in a narrow range? Also, manipulation is not risk-free.
To me the idea that multiple parties agree on some exchange rate which makes the retailers comfortable about accepting the coins and the buyers are guaranteed a profit as long as the price remains within a range seems plausible. I guess that might be manipulation of a sort.
But the kind of manipulation that traders engage in seems like trying to trigger margin calls and then they are trying, if there are a lot of short BTC, to make the price rise; I think we may have seen this sort of thing.

I am thinking a lot of individuals trading BTC for bucks.
Years ago, a guy says to me that he deliberately brought only his Amex card with him so he couldn't get a cash advance once his money was gone.
Then he asked me for a ride and we went to a pawn shop on the Strip -- he had called them to arrange buying a watch for 3k and selling it back for 2.7k -- he spent 300 bucks to get 2.7k plus sales tax. He really outsmarted himself.
So expect those sort of transactions. Lots of poker players seem to know about or are actual owners of BTC.

There is a system used amongst groups of people based upon trust that allows money to be virtually transferred across the globe -- an unofficial banking system called Hawala that maybe is being used for funding terrorism.
In any event, is there evidence that international terrorism is suffering due to lack of funds? That the addition of Bitcoin to it would facilitate something that is not already happening?

The big thing will be their *expanding* their use of BTC as BTC rather than converting to fiat. They said they might pay employee bonuses in BTC which is good.
The weed sellers in Colorado being forced to either keep bunches of cash and all the attendant problems (security, even mold if you hang onto it long enough) vs accepting BTC and **not** accepting cash is huge for Bitcoin. This comes from banks not wanting to handle legalized drug money because of lack of clarity from Feds.
Anyway, I could see a situation where, like when I first heard of BTC, you could not transact without BTC that people need to have it for practical, not speculative reasons.
Digressing: That oil is denominated in dollars is not a coincidence but something the USA negotiated and very much wanted and if OPEC decided to use BTC, I can't even imagine how valuable BTC would become. And it doesn't even have to be all of OPEC.

That fiat allows you to lend more than you have does not prevent lending completely of items like cars or BTC as you say.
So I forget what the issue was. I want to deposit BTC and get interest on in BTC. Someone borrows the BTC using probably USD as collateral. If BTC goes up, they have to deposit more USD or their dollars are used to buy BTC and I guess the balance of their collateral is returned to them (if any balance remains).

Also, Napoleon was the most extreme example.
Say we chose a random wealthy person who did not lead an exciting life (such as that of The Emperor):
I would say if you were put into a time machine to 1840 and maybe even very significantly later than that, within the first, say midsummer in Manhattan, day of your life as a 19th century millionaire (for there were no billionaires, another terrible problem of that time) you would be noticing the following, all of which no random person with a minimum wage job has to worry about now:
1. If you could get ice in the summer, it would have sawdust
2. No air conditioning
3. Decent air quality but streets were strewn with horseshit 
4. Plumbing?
5. Hot water from a tap?
6. Food quality and variety? Meat animals have been bred to produce quality unimaginable then. And variety? No fresh fruit out of season, and even essential nutrients, probably even for a rich guy, might be hard to obtain
7. Transportation: pretty obvious
8. Entertainment
9. Lighting: still whale oil which was very expensive (lucky thing you're rich)
10. Crime: I understand violence was much more common
11. Racism and sex-discrimination: good thing you are white and male (otherwise you wouldn't be a millionaire)
12. Headache: not even aspirin
13. Drugs and medical care in general were just terrible as was sanitation
Only good things were servants and land were probably cheaper. But servants were the only way to achieve a basic level of comfort and this was of course at the expense of said servants.
Summary: Poor people let alone middle class USA citizens have it incredibly good and focusing on ratio of CEO salaries vs average worker salaries is not a reasonable measure.
Once we get robots which will free society from the need to have people so down-trodden that they are willing to do the dirty jobs, things will be almost perfect if we don't screw it up.

It doesn't seem like the day-to-day movements offset commission and bid ask spread enough to justfiy day trading. Anyhow, we can't rule out that some coins are disappearing into the hands of long-term holders. I think there might be a way to analyze the Blockchain which could show this.

@_date: 2015-05-17 07:22:34
That is 100% right. If anyone can show me a scam that has lasted as long as Bitcoin has, I'm all ears.
And bear in mind, the spread of information was so much slower in the past that if say the Tulip Mania managed to last as long (it didn't) you have to take into account this slowness -- six years is a much longer time today for a "mania" to persist than it was in the 1600s.
That Bitcoin continues to trade for a significant amount per coin suggests to me that it is "real" -- it is useful for some people for some things. The way it will increase in price is more people using it for more things. Sounds sort of inevitable to me.

Again, wouldn't Bitcoin itself adapt to protect itself? The miners would not want a scenario in which Bitcoin is valueless.
This is the fundamental theorem: Even bad actors much less miners want to protect the value of BTC. So I rule the scenario implausible.
The scenarios have to take into account this self-protective aspect of BTC.
@_date: 2014-08-31 05:29:28
There is some speculative component in the current price as well as price that comes from its utility. Every transaction and user contributes to this utility. As companies start holding rather than converting to fiat, I think the utility component will grow also. I think the utility is a floor for the price and someday this floor will be 600. My complete guess is that the floor is not far from where we are now.

I was in your position years ago -- interested but no way to buy BTC (in 2011 -- oh my gosh, I wish I had known more then).
So if you could just find someone in your area who has Bitcoin and give her money face-to-face, a small enough amount initially so that getting burnt would not be too devastating, that would be the way I would go.
I have had nothing but positive experiences with meeting Bitcoiners in person.
The procedure would simple be to give the person a physical address your wallet provides and then she would transmit the Bitcoin. You would probably give her money first.
There are more sophisticated ways of doing it involving escrow for protection but I think you can dispense with those: Honestly, what if you lost even 250 bucks, would not kill you and I bet you can tell with most people that would not happen.
But it doesn't have to be a full BTC or at least not all at once. Give her half, wait for the BTC to show up in your wallet and then give her the other half or break it into 2 completely separate transactions, etc.

I strongly disagree about Amazon or any private company being able to do this.
This doesn't mean that Amazon can't do a swell job technically; but I don't believe a for-profit company will be able to get the support from people that is clearly needed for such a thing as an alternate currency to thrive.
There are other pros and cons but the above is the main con and it is sufficient all by itself.

Let us compare the number of extortionary crimes committed for Bitcoin vs dollars or fiat.
If BTC makes such crimes somewhat easier, I don't see the reason the rest of us non-extortionists/non-money launderers should be forced to keep our money in banks -- that is a high price to pay to reduce world-wide crime by maybe 1 percent of 1 percent of 1 percent.

You talking about the number of trades on BTC-E for .01 BTC (not one cent but about 2 bucks)?
If so, I believe (but do not know) these are attempts manipulate price. If for example margin calls are triggered by the last trade price or something, maybe someone is attempting to cause those.
Having said that, I can't believe that margin calculations do not take into account the size of trades so that a 100 BTC trade at 235 is given proportionally more weight than a .01 BTC trade at 233. 
Others have suggested that this is just attempting to affect the market through psychology which seems silly to me but maybe people do it anyway.
Finally, someone said it was the trades of bots but I don't find that a very satisfying explanation.

I really have no idea what your point is. You also frequently repeat that 3600 coins are mined each day as if that is incredibly consequential whereas it is a small percentage of the total coins traded each day.
I believe the price is driven by some function of utility which in turn is based on how many users there are; that number is likely to increase.

I think as things are now, absolutely. Without retailers, the decision is simply to hold or sell; with them, there are many more choices that ultimately result in converting BTC into cash. As I understand it, Overstock is converting to dollars as fast as they can.
But I think that as they start seeing people asking for refunds and being willing accept them in BTC they will perhaps change this policy.
The biggest thing will be when even a few of their suppliers begin to accept BTC. Then suddenly BTC they had a really good chance of being sold for dollars just continue to circulate -- then the acceptance of BTC by retailers will have the exact opposite effect of what you are concerned about happening.

Well look, "Bitcoin instead of banks" was the basic premise of the original post, so I am not going to argue.
But taxation being necessary I think you are not disputing; the need for standardized currency (rather than private) is part of the need to pay taxes.

Okay: What problem does it solve? Is it just a substitute for a key, has nothing to do with payments?
Because it sounded at first like you have a vending machine that you don't want to open until a certain amount of Bitcoin is deposited which is of course absurd since there is no physical Bitcoin accumulating.
EDIT: And BTW, if it serves as a key, anyone with the address could open it. On the other hand, I guess if the device worked only if the BTC *came* from a particular address, then it would be a secure key.

I don't understand why individuals in effect selling BTC (indirectly by buying on O who then sells them to Coinbase) would not lower tend to lower the price: an additional source of BTC. Please explain.
I think I understand why you say it is the "only responsible" way for O to hanlde BTC -- obviously if in the future a (publicly-traded) company can be said to be responsible by retaining BTC, it is a huge win for BTC. My point is, this day may be coming sooner than people think.

I mention stability of price. If the price were moving, I could see the same players buying &amp; selling but this would not be profitable or even interesting in a stable market. From this I infer that the coins are not being recycled but rather come from perhaps holders who bought at way lower prices or maybe businesses that use a lot of BTC, like remittance handlers.
Sure, it's a guess.

What I am asking is, a wallet that hold real dollar bills is not completely analogous to a brain wallet as far as I can tell. all a brain wallet is using you brain to remember a private key or keys or phrases to generate keys. The BTC you own must always be someplace in the blockchain, right?
@_date: 2014-02-28 07:37:53
I don't understand how the theft of something decreases its value, which seems to be the underlying assumption of the article. 
Except this: If BTC could be stolen by anyone at anytime, they would be worth nothing -- paradoxically, they would not be worth stealing. 
But that is not the case. BTC can be made almost theft-proof.
In fact, if  "stealability" of an asset is a partial determiner of the value, then suitably protected BTC (which means not put on an exchange, importantly) would have extremely high value.
Gold, dollars, bank balances got nothing on an asset that can be made completely secure with proper handling.

What choice did people have, practically speaking, to central banks.
I meant, and I think you knew this, Ponzi, South Sea, Tulip -- stuff like that. In those cases, once the jig is up, there are occasional slight bounces but then it goes down and it stays down. Bitcoin had plenty of opportunity to drop like a rock after for example Gox, but it did not.
Seriously, other than "central banking" (which I don't really agree with you on) tell me a scam that lasted a long time? Actually, I think the Madoff scam lasted pretty long but note how fast it collapsed once exposed.

The demand would arise from a site which did not want to fuck with credit cards and even customer accounts for that matter: you pays yer BTC and you watches yer flick without even a need for them knowing your name.
Guys (video producers) post a video, post a BTC address and start collecting money. The site is about as simple as one can imagine. For emphasis: The producer posts his own address so there is no need for address management or touching BTC of the producers.
You just create a video posting site which allows the posting also of BTC addresses. One technical obstacle that occurs to me:
If we want to avoid accounts then the wait period for the BTC payment might be an issue. But maybe the producer relies on trust or we do have accounts.
But it sure seems like BTC is not gratuitious here; I wouldn't know how to do this with credit cards but with BTC it should be pretty easy.
Right now on Youtube, if you post a flick and also post a BTC address do they take your movie down? Or are people already doing this sort of informal trust-based payments on Youtube?
@_date: 2015-05-27 05:49:30
Interesting, thanks.
Global volume figure is so large that if any significant percentage of the coins end up with someone who intends to hold, it would not take very long at this rate for the supply of coins to "dry up" which I think will cause a very pronounced rise in price the magnitude of which will be very hard to predict.
The figure I mean is currently 56k Bitcoin which is about .5% of all minted BTC. If all of these coins ended up in pockets of holders, then in less than one year, no BTC would be available. Wow.

The policy of taxing miners when the coins are mined seems like a bad policy (the miners should be taxed when coins are sold or used in a purchase). I can see many countries adopting a different policy for this.

I think it is extremely unpredictable. Even established things like gold are not only unpredictable but the things we know about it that should be significant determiners of price (like scarcity) are actually not that significant: platinum is much more rare but at one time was worth less and now I think is only slightly more valuable.
I sure like the idea that the value of the BTC is what percentage of the economy is transacted in BTC; if you find this compelling, then you should expect even higher value then 10k.
You can easily see scenarios where it drops like a rock; any sort of Goxing again will kill it, I think, whether it is due to BTC itself or another thief, I don't believe it will weather another one.

The price dropping may be a consequence of it having been too high. The price being non-zero for a very long time implies value and I think the price will increase with usage as mentioned before.

Right to all you said. But you have to admit this is not optimal.
Some users may elect to receive BTC as refunds or O may make that a condition (maybe giving incentives).
Some suppliers of O may take BTC, now or in the future.
For BTC to become really robust and not just a novelty, it should not require conversion to dollars.

People overstate the power of so-called whales: Yes, if willing to risk 10k coins to drop the price in hopes of... ? Driving the price down? Why? To cover another short position? Maybe, but maybe someone with more resources doesn't let the price drop. I think people have been indeed trying to move the price -- but if so recently they have had little apparent effect.

But you seem to be arguing against making money within ZA. The OP seemed to want to do this.
@_date: 2014-06-01 23:07:00
That is a reasonable point.
However, it seems like such a natural move that it is more likely that it is happening and has not been yet publicized than it not happening.
I would suggest that bonus rather than salary is the way to do it since salary is very regulated whereas a bonus can be almost anything.
So if an employee asked right now, "Hey, can I get that bonus in BTC?" you think Byrne would say no? If so, it must be due to current legal uncertainty.
I can't figure out from the O site what the refund policy for BTC purchases is so they seem to be playing the BTC card close to their vest. I don't think they mention BTC in their tv ads, for example.
EDIT: There is some fairly recent discussion about O and employee compensation. Byrne says he could pay in BTC but doesn't due to tax issues as far as I can tell. Bonuses are not mentioned in piece but I am guessing it may not have occurred to them to do it yet, because, as you say, Byrne would indeed tell us.
So why don't we start a thread: "Does your company pay bonuses in Bitcoin?" and see if anyone answers from *any* company?
@_date: 2015-05-17 08:47:25
Yes and I think that happens in the USA. But it could be argued that the banks are concerned, rightly or wrongly, with the fraud aspect; that would be what they say rather than, We are trying to hinder Bitcoin.
I am trying to only state non-speculative things but I certainly would not be surprised to discover that in fact banks are trying to hinder Bitcoin.
Because there is absolutely no way that adoption of Bitcoin has no bearing on their profits if not potentially putting them out of business completely.
So those who state that Bitcoin is inconsequential really should address just why banks seem worried.

You are absolutely right. However, given the stability in price, it feels to me like we are watching coins held for a long time being gradually liquidated. If so, this can't last forever or even for much longer.

I want to see this result in more virtual companies operating away from the prying eyes and sticky fingers of governments.
No way a company that develops software and pays its employees in Bitcoin can be effectively touched by a government.
If it can happen it will happen and Bitcoin will be the reason why small companies can succeed. Cost of regulation is too much for small startups and despite what they will tell you, such regulation doesn't help the consumers or investors either.
I lost a small fortune on publicly traded companies (that is, regulated) that went bankrupt anyway. You have to believe that the CEO knew this was going to happen long before it was announced but they continued to draw salaries and the shares continued to trade.

I really feel that only since I started moving coins around between addresses, after initially moving them from the online wallet that I gained an appreciation for Bitcoin:
Previously I never had a way to keep a relatively large amount of money in a secure way completely under my control. This is a huge thing that not only had I never experienced before but I assert that *no one* before the advent of Bitcoin experienced.
Every single person who has experienced this I think will upon the slightest reflection like what they see. Since the recent volume spikes, there are many more such people with this experience.

I think once they see coins on the blockchain and realize anyone else in the world can see them but only they, the holder of the private key, can touch those coins, all explanation will become unnecessary.
I once won over 10k in a live poker tournament. It was late at night but they wanted to give me the prize, in fact they did, in poker chips. I was supposed at that point walk across the street to my hotel? Of course not so I left the coins at the cage and got a check the next day. Bitcoin could have avoided that hassle.

I think businesses tend not be speculate in area in which they are not expert; so making money off of BTC appreciation is probably not considered a valid business practice.
But avoiding the costs associated with conversion while at the same time keeping Bitcoin for refunds sounds reasonable.
The key to all of our success (those who own it) is merchants having suppliers who take accept it -- this will cause the snowballing that will cause some of the optimistic predictions to come to pass or at least without it they can't happen.
I am keeping my eye on Cyprus where I believe that is a likely place for that to happen.

That is interesting (no word play intended) -- is it specifically *compound* interest to which you object?
Because interest itself makes perfect sense to me and so does compounding it since a person in theory could lend the interest out and so forth.
Are you suggesting that people lend money for no interest and if so, why would they be *interested* in doing so? (which I think in fact is why the same word is used in both ways)
As for money lenders being benevolent: no, they are business people.
Are there alternatives? I don't see any and it is interesting to note that major bankers of the 20/21st centuries had very humble beginnings loaning farmers cash against future sales of crops.
But you may be objecting to *central* bankers specifically and here you might well have a point indeed. The power these guys have and I don't know what category the guys who brought on the financial crisis of 2008 and yet just recently got huge bonuses belong, but they are bad people. I know that they design financial products just to confuse -- they have said that to people I know who went to grad school with them.
Much here is over my head so let me summarize:
1. Can you tell me whether you are against all forms of lending for interest?
2. If so, given that lending must happen because of illiquidity of future production, why should people lend? What do they receive in return for the risk of lending?

but you need a recurrent reason for them to use bitcoin.
you should encourage locals to build businesses. maybe literally people who will take bitcoin for a staple like rice for families who get remittances.
Here's details:
A local handles getting remittances, dealing with the person overseas. He shows the parents how much rice is in their account and gives it to them whenever they ask. (rice, cell phones payments, etc.)
You buy the bitcoin from the local entrepeneur, paying him rupee and make money eventually on the exchange rate.
EDIT: You find local rice wholesalers who will take Bitcoin, even better.
Be ready to lose money at first but even this mailing list I suggest will be worth something. In fact, maybe I will do something like that. 100k people interested in Bitcoin got be be worth a decent amount of money. Since you giving them Bitcoin, the amount you have to give each user might be small but it will look better than saying, one penny if you express it in Satoshi.
automate this and you can be successful, i bet.
happy to offer ideas on this if needed.

I understand how inflation is in some sense "theft" but how is deflation also a method of stealing?
I am very interested in the idea that an economy might be viable without a central bank and in particular viable using solely or largely Bitcoin. My very limited understanding of, for example, the limitations inherent in the gold standard is that it is too slow to respond to technological innovations that create value. Could Microsoft's market value have grown in a gold-standard economy? I think you would say, yes and if so, can you please explain?
I think what would have happened is the ability to get loans from the value of those shares would have been severely impaired and thus the company itself could not have grown as it did. If that makes any sense which it may well not.
@_date: 2015-01-18 10:05:35
I think key to applications is to not worry about the funding so much.
Let me explain: Say you had a Bitcoin stock exchange. Each buy and sell would not result at all in Bitcoin transactions being sent to the Blockchain -- instead, balances would be kept track of internally and only for deposit and withdrawing would Bitcoin transactions occur. (This might be obvious or not even seem related to what you just said.)
So all of my ideas, while they take advantage of Bitcoin and indeed would not work nearly as well with fiat, don't really require much Bitcoin expertise to implement. Putting money in and taking it out would be a separate area of functionality that would be implemented by developers versed in all the security aspects of Bitcoin, but for other functionality, the developers would not need to know even that Bitcoin is even be used.

Buying can be done in person or at a site. I have sold in person, just transferred coins using online wallet and then the guy paid me -- many bictcoin people are sort of enthusiastic about bitcoin so won't cheat you but you could transfer small amounts at a time.

I agree, especially because the bid/ask and commission is fairly high relative to say retail stock brokerage -- I think it is over 1 percent of the amount and so you have to get a 2 percent move before you break even.
My plan, so far violated many times, is to close my eyes and look at the price in another month. That is the only a person like me can make a big return because it is very hard for me to hang on to an investment that has gone up ten to one. I want 1000 to one on this one, maybe five years from now.

One thing I did learn: I will never discuss investments ever again with someone I know. Here I can just quit talking to them but when the huge profits were made (almost like winning a small lottery) on one stock, suddenly not just the people I had told (which u tend to do, trying not only to sort of brag but also to try to pump up the price silly as that sounds) but people that *they* had told came up to me with unsolicited advice. I honestly believe that made it harder to think clearly and not one person said, you know, if you sell it today, settlement is next year. That one piece of advice (I thought I needed to wait until the calendar date) might have made me liquidate and changed my life. Fuck. I think about it a lot.
So with BTC, if it does well and you tell a bunch of people, do you want to be hit up for money? kidnapped? or what they did to the poor guy with the neurological disease who they extorted somehow?
I will keep my mouth shut, knowing that I can always open it later but once the cat is out of the bag...

I don't know why small businesses accepting Bitcoin is considered an important metric by some. I guess it would not be bad and maybe it will one day happen but I think Bitcoin being used for things it is particularly good for: online payments and remittances (as others have mentioned) is the important metric.
Maybe in largely unbanked regions like parts of Africa you would expect to see BTC being used like credit cards are used in developed nations, someday if not yet.

Actually, given that using fiat puts such corporations under governmental controls that might be at odds with the goals/philosophy of a DAC, Bitcoin might be useful if not absolutely essential.
I read in another Reddit thread that Lawsky is trying to prohibit Bitcoin licencees (in his scheme for BTC regulation) from having a relationship with a DAC. 
But all guys like Lawsky are going to end up doing is forcing companies (not just DACs) to exist someplace other than the USA and thus not pay taxes here. 
It is literally hard for me to imagine the future without these new kinds of companies running "someplace" on the internet, doing good by being efficient creators of wealth and jobs.

Fiat is absolutely far more risky than Bitcoin. Gavin was not going to mention the cops stealing (yes **stealing**) cash that we saw on TV recently (John Oliver's show) and I knew about before I saw it there. 
Bitcoin will by next year or so stop having Goxing stories. The exchanges will become more reliable and more people will learn to manage their own BTC directly.

This raped in the ass thing/dying sort of lowers the level of discourse but I have noticed too that he is heavily supported here.
I can accept each of his activities except paying for murder is a low crime, even if it sounds cool to some, it really is low. I am prejudiced a little because I know a guy who took 5k to kill a woman and thank God failed. Ever since I realized what kind of person would kill and what kind of pussy would pay someone to kill (esp. a woman).
Ross, kill people yourself. Seriously: Some people have it coming, like for example the guy I mentioned above had the woman been my Grandma for example, but then I would do it myself for practical and moral reasons.
So people maybe should temper their support of him a little even though except for the murder thing I want him to be acquitted.

Only once in my life did I pick the peak of a stock -- I knew/guessed what it would go to and even when but did not sell because I thought I needed to hold on for tax reasons but I was wrong.

How is this different than his paying you in fiat and you buying BTC with it?

Again, the idea is automation and transparency. You as a shareholder could see, to a limited extent, where money was going.
Put more importantly, there would be much faster methods of getting rid of CEOs. 
I could see problems arise from overly "activist" shareholders, although these kind of companies are designed to appeal to people who want a say in their investment; nonetheless, mechanisms for controlling or eliminating such shareholders would exist.
It might also be that individual holders would have to elect representatives from among themselves, that only a certain number of shareholders would have direct access to financials, etc.

I think the halvening will have an effect despite its anticipation by speculators: It doesn't seem like speculation is having as much an effect as fundamentals: usage and production.
EDIT: I think we are trying to understand patterns in the movement of BTC that, even if some stocks or commodities really can be predicted (which I am skeptical of in the first place), maybe BTC being a new thing can't be. It is not a stock (but interestingly, it is something that is more a like stock than say gold is since there are many people working on it); it is not purely a commodity like gold -- there has really been nothing like it before.
So here's what *can* be predicted: **It will probably continue to surprise.**

Key is to help people buy and sell Bitcoin without being dependent upon online wallet companies. 
I am convinced that if more people understood how easy it is to directly handle their own Bitcoins, they would.
Help such people by explaining in non-snarky, and non-scary ways. I believe that many people are deliberately exagerrating dangers.
If you do have BTC in an online wallet, try moving a small, experimental amount to an address that you create. Then move BTC from that address to another address. **Once that works, you can do pretty much anything you need to do with Bitcoin all by yourself.**

There are serious people who believe the Internet itself might at some point become or in fact already be conscious.
How does the brain, billions of separate neurons produce a single consciousness? They assert that this might be happening with the Internet; it might be simplistic to say that the individual computers are neurons and the connections are nerves -- point is, no one knows what consciousness is.
But if the Internet is, how would we know? What would it do differently? Would it wait, wait until we give a lot of machines that would allow it access to the physical world, but play it cool before that? That's how I would do it but then I am only a dumb human.
I think the most likely path to human vs AI world are those people who *want* to become cyborgs. (They see this as the path to immortality.) These cyborgs will see old-fashioned humans as the threat. There will be legislation that will change the definition of human or person to allow computers or uploaded minds to be included.

But why is that amount of consequence? Why does that mean the price should decline? 
If it were $100 or $1000 it would not be meaningful -- I think that is clear. Why is 800k suddenly a significant amount of money spread among, for example, all current users of Bitcoin?
Why is Bitcoin worth anything? Why does trading continue within fairly narrow ranges (recently) if there is no actual value to "anchor' it? If there is no value and it is purely speculative, one would expect much more bouncing around and in particular, the price should be much lower.
Moreover, why are VCs shoving in aggregate something like a billion dollars into Bitcoin?

1. brainwallet.org provides software than you can run right from your browser but you can also save it as files and then access those files when you are not connected to the internet. This gives you a way to enter a phrase that will generate a public address and private key. The same phrase will give you the same address/key pair each time.
2. About the phrase: Don't write the phrase down but instead pick many (10) different things that both you know firmly but others don't. Like: First grade teacher name, best friend in 3rd grade, street you lived on in 1989 -- you get the picture. stuff you could write down but no one reading it would be able to use. Be creative
3. Now the address created will be what Coinbase needs and here is a cool part: once Coinbase has moved the coins, within a half hour maybe less, you will see the coins there on the blockchain by using, for  example, the search function of blockchain.info
4. Move in (3.) above  only .01 BTC or some small amount
5. The private key has not been used but you can guess it is used to allow only you to move coins from the first address you created to the second address. You used Coinbase as the client software the first time you moved coins but now you will need something like Electrum to move from the first address to the second address.
5. That's it. Now, someday you might want fiat for that .01 BTC -- you meet a person who want BTC and he hands you cash before or after you transfer the BTC from the second address to his address using the second private key. 
6. You will see all this stuff on the Blockchain. I moved more than 1 BTC an address long ago and it is still there. Without the private key, no one can touch your coins -- including you if you forget it but here's a quiz question: How do you get the private key if you need it?

But you see my point: It makes sense that a fork would entail a new blockchain potentially, even probably.
Miners operate on/maintain/build the blockchain so two sets of miner, one set which thinks the blocks in the chain should be of one size and the other set who disagrees could not co-exist, it seems like.
Can't believe some miner/sophisticated user has yet to chime in.

When I looked up Bitcoin for the first time, all I was directed to were these exchanges. 
If there is a place where you can buy BTC through your bank that then deposits them directly into a wallet, I did not see one or understand that I saw one, on Bitcoin.org (I think that is where I went initially).
@_date: 2015-01-21 06:23:51
I guess. Not that radical.
I think radical is giving control to shareholders. In theory, they have it now but in practice they do not.
I am not sure why Bitcoin would be needed for this except with fiat there is are bank accounts that it would not be practical for each shareholder to have control over. Maybe Bitcoin would allow that -- a main account where each owner has control over withdrawals.
Anyway, one way or another, CEOs have entirely too much ability to screw shareholders.

If it is indeed 75, then that would sure be the price i would prefer to be buying at except that this would represent a pretty solid floor if you accept some intrinsic usefulness for BTC. 
I think that BTC has some real value based on years of transactions not all of which are just traders trading with each other.
So 200 only has 125 of "give" to it. 
@_date: 2015-01-19 06:09:46
Indeed. I am guessing the electricity cost is still less than the current price but at the current price buying a rig plus electricity cost is greater than current BTC price. I had read that break-even is around 300.
So I feel that on the above basis, something's got to give. And it may be that people stop mining entirely until the difficulty drops. Or something -- I sure don't understand this mechanism whereby difficulty automatically adjusts.
Anyhow, there are people who understand this stuff well and no doubt are very concerned about the problem of miners stopping because it is no longer worthwhile for them to mine.

This is incredibly interesting and puzzling. On the USA show Vice (HBO) they showed legal pot sellers burdened by huge amounts of cash -- why? because banks would not accept their deposits because of state vs federal law.
so the sellers had to get armored cars and armed guards to deal with the vast amounts of cash. why they have not yet gone to Bitcoin is beyond me.
yes, there are issues but it seems like anything has got be better than dealing with the dangers and inconvience of boxes full of cash.
does that answer your question? probably not although maybe it does since maybe canada banks won't allow their customers to use CC to buy from pot sellers either.

Every time someone like Gates discusses volatility of Bitcoin he neglects to mention that even poor people get to decide for themselves and may *want* the volatility. Poor people are not less able to judge what is suitable for them -- imagine if in general rich people got to decide what is best for the poor or the government did.
Really? At what income level do you relinquish your right to decide what to do with your money?
Moreover, because it is volatile now does not mean it will continue to be.
@_date: 2015-01-25 04:32:35
I did as you did so here is a very detailed response:
The Bitcoin at any online exchange are not under your direct control. For example, if you want to fund online gambling by requesting a payment be made to an address that they somehow recognize as belonging to a gambling site (and I don't know how they would do so) they may not allow you to move the BTC.
So with the concern in mind that I might someday want to move my coins to another address and not be allowed to do so  (Already they do ask you if you are sending BTC to another person or to a company and if the later, they ask further questions.) I decided to diversify by moving some BTC to an address under my complete control.
The first step is to create an address. Not a wallet but an address. Associated with that address is a private key. You must keep the private key secret and never forget it while BTC remains at that address.
I can tell you how I got the address and key but I think other posts have been made about this. So for now, let us assume you created the address and saved the private key securely.
*The next step is extremely simple:* Your online wallet site will ask you for this public address which of course you can tell anyone without worrying about this and they will also ask for the amount of BTC you want to move.
Very soon after this, you can look at the blockchain and see that these BTC have been moved from the address belonging to the site (which you had no reason to know about before, although I suppose they could tell you) and to the address that you created. That's it as far as getting the coins under your control.
Note that the private key you were given has yet to be used. As you might have guessed, it only is used when you want to move those coins to *another* address which in fact you might want to do soon because not only is this a good experiment but it separates those coins further from the original site.
So say you decide to do so. You must create a second new address and save a new key for that address.
The first transfer from the site to the address required no software -- you were using the site's software to effect this first transfer but the next transfer requires a Bitcoin client such as the Electrum wallet.
You will tell this wallet what the address you want to transfer BTC to and the address where the BTC are. The wallet needs the first private key in order to do this.
It is my understanding that transferring less than all the coins at the address to another address is not secure -- the remaining coins may not be safe because you used the private key. I do not know if this is true.
So let us say we do the "safe" thing and use the key only once to move all the BTC to the second address. You can check the blockchain to see that the coins are no longer at the first address and now at the second address you created.
That is it until you want to move or spend the coins. Then you will use the second private key.
Note that if you wanted to spend BTC at an address on a purchase smaller than those amount stored at that address, you would actually use the private key twice -- first for paying for the purchase and the second time (soon after for security's sake) for moving the remainder to a new address. Not sure why this is so necessary.
Let me know if this helped or if I made a mistake.

I don't know how many but it is hard to imagine that at least some coins are being pulled "off the table" into the hands of long-term holders as I keep saying.

But will still suck for holders. I suggested that any price below what miners pay is a good price; I still find that compelling.
10 bucks would be because of major and effective regulation that makes BTC almost useless -- 10 I think would be a brief stop on the way to zero.
My contention is: Bitcoin is worth nothing or a lot more than it is now with the caveat that new coins being mined keep a lid on the price. Eventually that lid will effectively go away.
Summary: Thrilled to be able to purchase at well below miners' cost (which I have heard is around 300/BTC); frustrated at being poor enough to not be able to take advantage of today's low prices.

1. Create a gmail account: BitcoinGiveAwayIndia
2. Offer to send one Bitcoin to be given away randomly
3. Requirements:
A. They sign up to BitcoinIndia
B. They email you this name plus their public address plus their city in India
You can if you want verify that the Reddit account was not just set up to enter the lottery. Nothing illegal (in USA anyway it would not be) since you are asking for them to purchase nothing.
With any luck, for the cost of a single Bitcoin, you will have a decent email list. Sure, some fake entrants but most will be actual people some whom will be interested in hearing more from you if you have something smart to say. Doing this fast shows your energy level.
If not many bother, than you might have seen that the level of interest is indeed too low to proceed.

I am not sure if you are saying that companies will always sell their BTC on an exchange and therefore there should be enough BTC for all.

@_date: 2015-01-10 10:40:27
Would you agree that Bitcoin usage is a necessary or at least useful aspect of such DACs?
My thinking is this: The money for a company has to be someplace and if it is in a bank, a comparatively small number of people would have control over this money. That does not mean that the CEO can just write himself a 75 million dollar check but what it does mean is that once the board passes the bonuses, the shareholders can't stop it. 
Whereas with Bitcoin, any number of arrangements can easily be envisioned which could enable shareholders to prevent this.
But maybe I am wrong and Bitcoin is kind of immaterial to these DACs.

I see a website with clear instructions about how to get started.
Much of what I have seen features the protocol too prominently when all that most people need is how to get a coin, send a coin.
I think people, once they see the address they themselves have created holding a quantity of Bitcoin that they themselves have put there will be excited and "get it" simultaneously. I started out with an online wallet and it was kind of boring but as soon as I moved the coins to my own address I did get it -- moreover, since at one point I was afraid that the online wallet might ask for a lot info before I moved the coins, perhaps someday preventing me from moving them at all(!) and they already do restrict you from moving them to for example poker site, I was reassured that I finally had complete control.
Here's a suggestion: Get people to open their own addresses by offering a small amount of free Bitcoin to them, perhaps in exchange for an email address which will give you a nice mailing list.
@_date: 2015-01-21 07:13:30
No: I envision a company that is completely automated. Shareholders vote online, can propose referendums etc. all online. This is enforced by the shareholders having access to the company funds and I think this control of funds makes contract enforcement unnecessary.
Moreover, regulation and contracts enforced by governments has not protected shareholders from losing literally 100% in a short time like during the bursting bubble of 2000 when also CEOs gave themselves huge bonuses perhaps seeing their companies cratering before the shareholders did.
Also, along with online referendums, there would be complete transparency to shareholders except for agreed-upon areas.
Now, shareholders might abuse their access but their ability to do things like propose that the CEO be eliminated over and over would be dealt with by the right to buy such shareholders out -- and of course self-interest would prevent most abuses.

Madoff stole a decent amount of money that made it into his pockets, his cut of the "investments" but most of the money was redistributed and many people did very well with him.
The difference between Madoff and Ponzi is that Ponzi was a well-meaning but monumentally unsophisticated "financier" (if you read about his postage coupon idea, it is like something a bright grade school kid might have come up with before his parents explained what was wrong with it; I also used to get chain letter invites by friends who really believed and Ponzi sounds like someone who would also have been a believer in such schemes) but as far as I know, Madoff knew what he was doing although even in his case, he might have genuinely at one point planned to actually invest the money until he realized he had a good thing going without doing so.
There are a lot of people worse than Madoff and I think Ponzi was actually a nice guy, a victim of his own initial success.

Many such exchanges, each would requires a critical mass for liquidity could be created. They could be called "clubs" rather than exchanges.
They could also communicate with each other to solve occasional liquidity issues that could not be handled intra-club.
I am proposing nothing particularly novel; big idea is to keep dollars and other fiat out of the loop and thus avoid banks and regulation.
I believe it would be as fair a shake or better than a small trader gets in a conventional options exchange -- the bid/ask spreads are terrible there.

The reason for pseudo-currency is that without something other than Bitcoin, there is no way to have an option strike price.
The pseudo-currency could in fact be exactly dollars. But the key is, money going in is Bitcoin (or other crypto) and same for money going out. There is no actual fiat involved except for pricing.
It works exactly as if you had an options exchange where prices were denominated in dollars but settlement is only in crypto. Banks are not involved and hopefully the advantages of this are clear.

I have a different suggestion: Experiment with very small amounts of Bitcoin.
Create an address, remember the private key, move .1 BTC (or whatever is small enough -- 30 bucks won't kill you if you screw up) into it from you existing online wallet and see how it goes. 
Watch the address for a few days convince yourself that things worked as you expect and then do the following:
This step is a big one because the first time you moved coins, you were using the online wallet as the client to move the BTC.  Now you will have to use a client that you have downloaded to move the .1 BTC into another address. This second address you also need to remember the address of.
Once you have done both these things -- the risk is only .1 BTC -- you should start to feel more comfortable. At this point, with the .1 BTC in the SECOND address, you can see how everything moved. Moreover, since no one but you has the private key for the second address, those .1 BTC are safe. The wallet software did not need to know the private key for the second address.
I used Electrum as the client to move the coins in the second transaction.
@_date: 2015-01-21 10:22:28

I can tell yours is not a sincere post but for others reading:
All settlement is in Bitcoin or other crypto-currency. Prices are in fiat-like currency which is necessitated by the nature of options.
To be really clear: If Bitcoin is trading at 200 dollars (== 200 market bucks) currently, a plausible option might be the February 15 225 market buck call. The price for the call might be ten dollars.
If Bitcoin hit 250 market buck before expiration, the value of the option would be 25 market bucks. When settled, your account would hold 25 "market bucks" which if pulled from the account would result in .1 Bitcoin being sent to an address you designate.

I too was confused about this sort of thing (although not this specific thing).
I assert the following: Until you have moved a small amount of coins from Coinbase to an address that you have created **and** also moved coins from that address to to another address, you will not get the proper "feel" for Bitcoin.
Both steps are crucial. The first is good, you will learn about creating an address but still will not know how to move coins since Coinbase handled that in your first transaction; the second completes your initiation because you will have to download a Bitcoin client in order to do it.
Important: Save your private key for both new addresses you create and to be safe when you are doing this, create the addresses while offline so that the keys have no way of being transmitted elsewhere when you create them.
I or other can explain in more detail if you are interested the full procedure and some will take issue I am sure with my exact procedure but I am 100% convinced that only using Coinbase is not enough for someone truly interested in Bitcoin or someone who wants complete control -- say in the future online wallets start restricting where you can send coins? What then?

There is no reason to start a business just for ripping people off if in the long run there are huge profits from being honest.

That happens with cash -- when you do biz with individuals how often do they have credit cards? 
And if they do, does the bank automatically resolve the dispute in your favor? 
Bottom line, I don't think credit cards' reversibility offers that much value in practice. And you have to think what you pay for it.
For really big Bitcoin transactions where you don't want to hand over the BTC and the other party doesn't want to hand over merchandise, there is escrow. In face-to-face transactions, like BTC meetups, someone could specialize in being a fair middleman for a small fee.
Honestly, what do credit cards really offer that BTC could not be made to duplicate?

This is a significant percentage each day of all minted coins -- 1% or so. My question is, where are they coming from?

You buy a Bitcoin call, say, with the strike price in maybe the average of pounds and dollars. (This is the pseudo-currency that potentially helps avoid regulation but also is more reasonable since why should fiat always be dollars?)
If the Bitcoin price moves into the money, and you sell, the value might be stored in your account in the same pseudo-currency but when you move your profits out, they are converted into the crypto-currency of your choice.
If this were done off-shore, since no banks are involved, I see no effective way for a regulator to try to enforce any rules on it.

I am hoping that attempts to regulate Bitcoin will be shown to fail spectacularly.
They can obviously stop big US companies from accepting BTC but what else can they really do by statute? I am not talking about some cyber attack but just telling citizens that can't use it seems pretty hard to not only stop but even detect.
Getting ones coins off of online wallets (hosted wallets) might be a very good idea because that could be an area of attack. I hear that exchanges try to stop one from transferring BTC to poker sites. This can be circumvented easily now but what about the future when they decide to monitor not just the first address but later addresses and then disable your account for that reason, maybe take your coins?

It is probably easiest to buy from an exchange although you still have to involve your bank, setting up your account. So instead of that you could simply
1. Create an address
2. Give that address to someone who owns their own BTC already and buy them from that person.
Thereafter you can move those coins around and no one except that first person in theory knows you have them. No bank, no big exchange.

Just to clarify why you don't need a bank account. There are of course services which allow you to buy Bitcoins using you bank account but besides being unnecessary, the set up is time consuming and it may be for a completely new bank account for security reasons there might be extra hassle.
But all you need is an address (and the private key associated with it) which you can create with a wallet. Then you give someone money and they put BTC into that address. That's it. (Or you can also get BTC because someone generously just gives you some to fool around with as Cowboy did.)

There is a certain electricity cost associated with mining. Some people have asserted that that cost is about 300/BTC.
I know the cost can be adjusted if fewer miners are out there.
I don't know if you are saying that the cost is much lower than 300/BTC currently or that the cost indeed is around 300/BTC but paying less than the miners are paying is not particularly compelling.
I find paying less than miners are paying to be a pretty good idea so I would like to know what the current cost is.

BTW, this shows you how easy a for-profit lottery could be done except Reddit probably would not allow it.
But if you had a site that would allow it, you could have a very low-tech lottery set up in hours. maybe just as we are doing now, the first one would be free and then the next one you would charge .01 Bitcoin. Wow. People trust you enough and you do it someplace where you not violating laws, you could start making money very fast.
Write the software to support this in various places and you could maybe (depending upon laws) be running lotteries all over the world in a very short time.

There are people who think somehow that in some magic way, people should be protected from loss. 
You will hear it argued that money you put in the bank is protected but Bitcoin isn't so you should not invest in Bitcoin. But the "protection" you get in the bank is not unlimited and like all forms of insurance, you pay for, currently it must be a huge chunk of the pitiful interest rate you get.
Consumer protection if you use credit cards but BTC none -- again, you pay for this. The best consumer protection is to deal with vendors who have a good reputation, not some bank who is charging you for protection you do not need 99% of the time.

I agree with you -- many unqualified opinions here. I think that is what you are saying. Or are you saying you think someone who can't code can nonetheless have valid opinions about Bitcoin? -- I think I would have to disagree with that in general.
But with that being the implicit disclaimer, it is okay for them to post. 
That is quite different than to spend money to disrupt Bitcoin. If he still holds a lot of Bitcoin, this is puzzling behavior because having enough brains to know that you need expert advice seems within his range.
So I have to conclude either he doesn't have huge BTC holdings anymore or I am overestimating his thinking ability.

Every place where you can spend Bitcoin is a place for an individual with Bitcoin knowledge to help people set up wallets and other BTC-related activities for which the individual could of course charge Bitcoin consulting fees.
The owner of the business would frequently welcome your presence.

There is not a linear relationship between cost and quality/utility/value. If you pay half as much, you may get something worth a third. 
Of course, this is not true of all products but rich people have access to the same things that poor people do; it is not true the other way around.

Sounds like you should do well. But you know no one who will save you the cost of flying? I mean, send anyone here the cost of the flight I am sure they would send you BTC.
What would be the issues once you had BTC? Security? Finding customers? This sounds too good to be true but maybe it isn't.
I knew a guy from SA who found people selling Krugerrands in USA for bullion prices but in SA they had large numismatic premium and he did well. So there are sometimes opportunities out there.

In this I do not see BTC preventing the problem. The cases where cops have literally stolen cash money meant for, for example, buying a car or in a case in Nevada where the cop was apparently tipped off by a casino from which the citizen had won a bunch of cash -- both of these show the dangers of physically carrying a lot of paper money (although in the latter case, converting the cash to BTC would not have been practical).
(Still don't know why pot sellers in Colorado are using guns and armored cars rather than Bitcoin.)

If China is behind this, why such a glaring bug in the code?
I think it would be hard to assemble a group that is competitive in terms of skill with the current Core team and a non-developer would have a lot of trouble doing this even if he was not doing development himself.
Interviewing of developers is hard and that is just the beginning -- after the developer is hired, you have to continue to evaluate and that is where a non-techie would be lost.
It is interesting to note that with few exceptions, the heads of the major software companies today (Google, Facebook, etc.) are very competent developers. Of course Bill Gates was an exceptional coder although I would guess he would have trouble nowadays -- the kicker is, Bill would *know* that he can no longer write code at a high level.

But they say that refund is not in BTC so maybe it is complicated by having purchased initially using Bitcoin but it doesn't sound like a direct effect of using BTC.

If you know that for sure, then there is no reason for anyone to listen to him about Bitcoin.
This is not elitism; it just doesn't make sense for someone like him to have opinions about a highly technical subject. That he thinks he should be influential without technical qualifications is absurd.
I believe the bug discussed last week is a consequence of his inability to understand the qualifications of the developers in his employ.

well, it only has to be 1. if the thief doesn't know which one, i would say the key is practically useless. i am guessing changing the first or last character is a bad idea.
the more copies of key the safer it is from being lost but the higher the risk of it being found by someone else. I don't have 3 separate safe places. 
But you could even tattoo the key on your stomach if only you knew what character was changed.
@_date: 2017-01-16 03:15:23
Obviously this sort of approach won't work.
I wonder if Satoshi foresaw the need to compensate developers -- I don't recall this being mentioned in the whitepaper.
@_date: 2017-08-17 10:42:24
The loss of brain function to the extent that you cant remember a single character and position is a pretty low probability scenario and you might also forget the safe places.
If you have loved ones, then give them the keys while you are alive. How will they find the safe place?
I just think storing the private key as a completely unencrypted string is dangerous and yet this sounds like a simple way to avoid much of this danger.

We have a different experience. I am in the midst of listening to video of someone describing SeqWit: I have rarely heard a more coherent explanation of a complex subject. 
Being a talented developer requires that the person can break down complex subjects into understandable pieces.
@_date: 2017-01-16 03:05:26
Yes but this is arguably one of the most valuable open source efforts and I think a formal process for compensating committers would be a good idea; maybe this could be automated just as miners are compensated.

I may be biased: I had a trivial Bitcoinj question posted to a forum and he took the time to answer it.
But more rationally: A person works hard on a tough and speculative project without remuneration (at first anyway he did it for free I think) and I would error on the side of caution -- saying "Don't trust him," is, as I already said, making a very strong and potentially damaging statement.
I believe all the devs have Bitcoin's best interests at heart -- that is the only stance that makes sense -- and I wonder what the agenda of someone who attacks his character might be.

Stability is very healthy -- even if it frustrates, in the short term, holders. Stability makes hedging cheaper for businesses and makes planning easier. I think there are cases where swift increases, exciting though they may be, are hard on merchants.
So I think we will see periods of stability during which merchants adopt followed by rises as the adoption fuels demand. Maybe we are seeing this already.

1. On Windows, there is an installer so I assume it is the installer (rather than the Electrum software itself) that is run through the hash256 app. 
2. I don't know where the hash can be found after it is downloaded, how to run it through the app, etc.
3. I might be able to google the above but I am a programmer. How could a non-technical person figure this kind of thing out, to the point that they are comfortable that they have performed the procedure correctly? Seems to me this would stop a lot of people in their tracks and make them not want to bother with the whole Bitcoin thing if they are worried about the wallet software.

I think it is completely plausible that a holder would want the straight dope from somebody. By definition, that somebody has to be a party that knows and is truthful and that should be an exchange, preferably more than one. Also a miner and also a committer. More than one of each.

Sounds like you know what you are talking about; I hope this is an honest explanation.
You seem not to be suggesting that you will lose coins but something like double spends.
However, given that this situation you describe sounds bad and thus will affect the value of Bitcoin, it seems like the fork will be undertaken in such a way to avoid this problem and/or few will migrate if it affects the value of Bitcoin negatively.

gizram84: Thanks for this. Bear in mind the many holders (or prospective holders) of Bitcoin lack sufficient technical expertise to fully follow the arguments and to know what steps need to be taken in various scenarios -- I count myself among those lacking such expertise even though I write code for a living.
I think these discussions frankly scare many people: They don't know what is going to happen to Bitcoin's value; they don't know if somehow by doing the wrong thing they will lose a significant portion of the value.
I have asked Coinbase and Coinsetter to provide this kind of guidance because even those Reddit posters who sound very sharp may in fact not be -- I am not able to judge one way or the other -- or may be deliberately trying to mislead holders because of their own agendas.
I am at this point really considering shedding many Bitcoin not only because I need cash but because of this uncertainty.
What do you think would be the best way to reduce this uncertainty? To reassure holders? I do not think I am the only one worried about the future and maybe this is even affecting price.
The heck of it is, maybe things are basically okay or at least not emergent-- both exchanges indicated that they would look at formulating a statement.
@_date: 2015-08-03 14:26:27
The fundamental theorem is that no one with a large stake in Bitcoin (as the core developers all have) is going to "hijack' Bitcoin or do anything else unilateral that will undermine its value. Large exchanges and miners are all cooperating in discussing the future of Bitcoin.

Wow: That is quite a statement, "Don't trust him."
A man is making a living developing for Bitcoin, his entire professional reputation is tied up with this and you say something that would severely compromise his ability to continue his Bitcoin-related development activity.

I note that the "Bitcoin Days Destroyed" number has been low for a long time -- not sure but this seems to imply to me that newer players are selling whereas longer-term BTC holders keep holding. I think this is a positive sign.

I will. It is amazingly puzzling and scary since I thought I was being careful. Ironically, it is fear of the pass phrase being stolen that led to it being lost -- if I could have stored it in plain text in my email which ought to be safe (long shot that it would be stolen from there except I was also worried about a key logger which is also unlikely).

There is a paradox: I think that the very reasons I would hold Bitcoin with only modest appreciation would lead to much more significant appreciation.
I want to hold BTC for all sorts of reasons: ability to move my cash around without it being subject to theft by criminals or even cops; I want to be able to send it to other people without needing a bank -- all these good things.
So if Bitcoin could do all of the above for me and was guaranteed not to go down (forget about 1%) how could the price not just zoom? 
I guess the only reason it has not zoomed is because no such guarantee about future price exists.

To clarify: The escorts will not close the accounts nor will the customers of the escorts. Coinbase will possibly notice a pattern (But how, &lt;platinum_rhodium&gt;?) and close the account of the customer. So ideally, buy coins with Coinbase, move them to an external address (move many, not lots of small moves) and from this address pay the escort.
But just to be clear, how will Coinbase detect anything?
**EDIT: I think the problem is that the escort is suggesting using Coinbase as a destination for payments from Johns. I think this is what is concerning people on this thread.**

The charts show pronounced increase in transactions. Coinbase shows many more BTC sold per day. I think increased usage is very definitely occurring. If it were not then we would be in real trouble.
But I think a positive effect from stability is more willingness to use Bitcoin by businesses. There are some cases I think were stability is even better than a price increase.
EDIT: Another effect I think we will see is more BTC going into the pockets of long-term holders and this will drive prices up. The amount of BTC being traded each month is a very big chunk of all available BTC. The idea that it is the same people trading back and forth not only makes no sense but would indicate a real restriction on the amount of available BTC.

Right. If someone else obligingly grabbed all 20,999,979 other coins, you would be one in 3.5 billion.
I do wonder if anyone besides the inventor holds anything close to a million BTC. It might be very hard to acquire that many even though plenty of people have the ability to write a 300 million dollar check. 
I have posted many times before: a significant percentage of all available BTC trades on exchanges every day and some part of those are disappearing from the market -- I think the price will rise very fast as businesses who need Bitcoin struggle to get them in order to do that kind of business. Maybe this is what we are seeing right now, the beginning of businesses, not speculators, grabbing BTC.

I am not sure what it was that you didn't know about, but it is not surprising to discover that only the rich (very rich) could afford the electricity-generating dynamos that Edison eventually wanted to put throughout cities. It was JP Morgan who actually bought one for his house -- first man in the world (after Edison himself, I guess) to have electric lights in his home.
Eventually neighborhoods had these dynamos (probably in richer parts of the city) but as probably a lot of people know, it was AC that allowed long-distance transmission and hence long-distance generation of power that allowed many more people to have electric lights which changed everything.

I have no doubt that Byrne is behind Bitcoin and he did give out BTC at the t0.com kickoff; but as you say, Peer Nova is not "The" Blockchain.

And will we be able to look at the usage by examining the Blockchain? It would be really exciting to see the bond stuff that Byrne mentioned -- this he was clear about its using the Bitcoin Blockchain.

My sense is that in fact the price is not based on largely speculation. If so, what is the reason that the price stays in such narrow ranges for long periods and that indeed the fluctuations have become less extreme recently? (Based just on eyeballing the chart.)
Of course, speculation is a component but it feels to me as if usage accounts for a decent proportion of the price. And it is understanding this usage that interests me: How much is spent on illegal drugs, how much is used in remittance processing, etc.

I think TA is probably going to be way more applicable to Bitcoin than to stocks.

Obviously it works -- economies have run this way for the past century. If we had stuck to gold in the USA, would it have been flexible enough to support for example the high tech revolutions we have been experiencing every 10-15 years or so?
You can say that gold would have just gone up in value to handle things but maybe it would have been too slow?
I am far from being an economist or expert on anything, but I think that it has been argued that gold-backed money would not work in an international very rapidly-changing system due to limitations inherent in physical money -- the need to move gold around and store it. Maybe there are other issues.
But if it is true that the primary problem with gold is the above, then maybe Bitcoin is the best of all possible worlds: both limited supply and ability to move it around more or less instantaneously.

To be honest, I think I, and not to speak for everyone else but I would guess others here, find the discussions about blocksize and other matters that seem to be important for Bitcoin, very hard to follow.
Not only is the subject itself complex but I am not sure that everyone who presents themselves as an expert and then advocates a particular approach are
1. Indeed experts
2. Even if they are experts, are they honest supporters of Bitcoin or are they very insidiously representing themselves as such but actually, perhaps under various aliases, trying to mislead people in an attempt to create support for a very bad approach.
Is it important that people here on Reddit understand the issues and if so, what is the best way? Basically, whom can we trust??
@_date: 2015-07-13 21:37:59
Thanks. But anyway, that would seem to account for things like resistance, etc. With different exchanges and different currencies, this effect should not be so pronounced, right?

Do some Argentinians invest in/horde BTC?

If sex workers begin to prefer or even insist upon BTC this is very big because it a near universal use case.

It is of course very common to do what you ask: That is how Bitcoin-based remittance processors operate. 
But if you do not intend to spend all of your money but just want to get it out of the USA, converting it to Bitcoin is a first step that does not immediately have to be followed by conversion to Canadian money. You could leave at least some in Bitcoin -- not all if you are concerned about Bitcoin fluctuations.
It seems weird that banks would charge you more to move money from your US account to a Canadian bank. What happens if you write a check on your US account and simply deposit it in a Canadian bank? Maybe this does not work at all because of different currencies?

A general thing that we lost since magazines and books started to be supplanted: a reasonable way of ascertaining expertise. In the old days, no one was going commit the resources necessary to publish the words of someone whom they had not determined had real credentials.

Now everyone can have a website that looks boss and if you happen to send a printed letter, it too will look like something that even Joseph Stalin's secretary could not have produced with a platoon of sub-secretaries working day and night, the only breaks being for torture.

Why would you not get in trouble for having gold just as you would get in trouble for US dollar? Is it any foreign currency or just USA?
Also, would there not be many thieves looking for physical assets in a country where many people are buying them?
Frankly, I can see nothing safer than buying Bitcoin, not telling people how much you have. The only danger is a big drop in price relative to your own currency but that could happen with gold also.

I do not completely understand the limitations to which Bitcoin is subject, but if the 3tx/sec is correct, I would be willing to sacrifice coffee-buying transactions for bigger transactions that keep larger businesses afloat.
The originators of things are often incredibly wrong about their ultimate usage. One simple example: Edison saw electricity only as a way of providing light; powering appliances, heating homes, cooking dinner was not even considered as far as I know.

Excuse my complete lack of your own language -- your English is fine!
I think it is completely reasonable to put **some** money in Bitcoin. Going to zero seems extremely unlikely; dropping significantly seems very possible; so does going up. 
It could be argued that that the most you can lose is current price; the most you can gain is unlimited. But that is true of any investment.
**One thing: Avoid telling people you have it: doing so removes one of its big advantages.**
Think of scenarios in which having an asset that is 100% transportable and that you can keep secret is valuable. Then think of any other asset besides Bitcoin which has these attributes. Not gold, not cash, not diamonds.

The number of coins traded each day on their exchange is probably the most important figure. I would like to see historical graph on this.

The fact that today's lower class workers in the United States are better off in every respect than the wealthy of a century ago needs to be taken into account.

Now the poor in other countries like India are a different matter.

But why would gold not have risen in value per ounce rather than it be necessary to extract more gold from the ground?
I would guess the problem would be the speed at which gold prices rose would be too slow to account for companies like Microsoft which had very quick growth -- even if some felt MSFT was worth a lot and therefore gold would go up, there would be others who would not agree with the valuation or potential of MSFT and thereby limit its ability to raise new cash.

Don't understand what you are saying. I think you mean that governments would have trouble enforcing this.
I think every passing day makes it less likely. More people get involved with Bitcoin and countries like perhaps the Philippines find that Bitcoin is a significant part of their economy and do not cooperate. 
Maybe even a single country, not even a big country, allowing Bitcoin to thrive will be enough. Especially because one such country's success will encourage other countries to allow Bitcoin to be used, perhaps with minimal regulation.

I feel like after six years the chance of zero is pretty low. There was a Twilight Zone where crooks steal gold and find after awakening 100 years later that *gold* has no value. (Actually, I am wrong: they all die thinking they are rich.)
But even if the probability of BTC going to zero were 50%, that does not mean that some of one's saving should be held in BTC.
You could say that about tulips, etc. of course but tulips lack some of BTC's important features -- there is nothing other than a crypto currency that gives you the amazing things you can do with a crypto currency.

I would like to separate out the attributes that it can be argued contribute to its illicit usage from the attributes that do not. The "be your own bank" thing must be the number one thing about Bitcoin that makes it truly attractive.
The Blockchain being used for all sorts of stuff comes in second. To restate what has already been stated many times, it is **The Blockchain** I am talking about, the one already up and running, not some version that a bank hopes will somehow work without Bitcoin.

That is actually a very good point. Bitcoin is not for someone who by their own mistakes might lose it or make it inaccessible.

I actually agree. Always thought things would work themselves out without government interference. But having said that, I am not convinced that the position of Blacks in the South postwar *would* have in fact improved without legal action. The book Slavery By Another Name showed me what happened in the 70 years from end of Reconstruction to beginning of WW2 and it was chilling. Blacks were imprisoned and their labor sold and this worked out for non-Blacks.
Some say slavery would have ended without the Civil War -- this book showed me that it would not have necessarily.

"Gold" that can be carried without risk of confiscation and transmitted electronically to anywhere there is Internet has got to be worth a lot more than gold the element. It is a no-brainer to put at least some wealth in Bitcoin. There is absolutely no counter-argument.

I can't believe that Bitcoin's total capitalization is based purely on speculation. If it were, it would not be becoming less volatile which can be easily seen by looking at the graph for the past year.

You could make more than the market cap in theory through the leverage you get from options. But in practice I doubt that could be done.

It would be great to get an update on this article next month (to see if trend continues) with more details as to actual number of Bitcoins involved in the transactions.
Europe being up 70% is still very nice just not as big as 500% but Europe already had much bigger numbers.
Looking at any chart at say blockchain.info shows marked increases. I have heard volume increases proceed price increases (In the stock market: here's an obscure connection to the Outer Limits: The guy who I heard say this was Richard Ney, actor turned investment counselor who played Mr. Zeno in a 1960s OL.) and I think for something like Bitcoin this applies even more than for stocks since stocks have much more going on internally to muddy the waters.

No, 10% I just pulled from my ass. It is not a minimum. In fact, that is probably way too much for most people indeed.
Maybe given the volatility, the amount you should buy should an amount that losing the whole thing would not sadden you too much.
But there is reason to buy even if you thought you might lose on it.
I would say if you were in the tech industry, downloading a wallet, buying BTC, buying something with it and getting change is worth doing just to learn about Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-07-15 18:08:54
I think the fundamental theorem of Bitcoin is that large holders are of course very interested in Bitcoin maintaining its value. So if indeed the concentration of Bitcoins in a small number of hand is bad for Bitcoin, they would do something about it.
I don't at all see this specific thing as a problem, but generally speaking, any problem that exists with BTC will be top priority for large miners or large holders to solve.

I was asking, what important thing is Bitcoin involved in? While drugs is part of what Bitcoin is used for, it doesn't seem like it provides enough economic activity by itself to justify the price. That is to say, the current price of Bitcoin is either based largely on speculation or it is based on real usage and if it is the latter, then I think there must be something more to Bitcoin than just drug trades. (Which is pretty clear.)
But is remittance handling that big of a deal at this point? Is title registration? Is P2P payments important?
What I would like to hear is the Bitcoin is now part of a growing economy that would not work without Bitcoin or would not be nearly as profitable.

As many have said, Greeks will not have much cash to buy BTC but may wish they had in the past; citizens of other countries will watch as Greeks struggle without access to their own wealth and learn from this.
I think this will inevitably lead to some people buying Bitcoin who would not have: Firstly, holding physical cash is incredibly dangerous when it is known by thieves that it is common for people to have such stashes; secondly, literally millions of people may know what Bitcoin is now -- they may have heard the word before but now they have some idea about accessing exchanges to acquire Bitcoin.

As one poster mentioned, you could certainly control automatically to whom the money gets sent -- if somehow you could identify "bad" addresses. But as another poster said, once spent, those BTC are out of your control. And if somehow you *could* do what you want, you would reduce the value of the BTC so constrained tremendously.

Some have suggested that large miners themselves are doing this. I think this is extremely unlikely: Why would they risk damaging the reputation of Bitcoin for short term profits?

@_date: 2015-07-28 11:33:12
It has been argued that the volumes we see at the various exchanges are the same coins going back and forth. I don't think there is any evidence of this happening. So the point is, I think a reasonable percentage of the trade volumes end up in the pockets of long-term holders and with fairly conservative guesses about what percent this is, it would not take very long to sponge up the total supply. For example, if 10k coins are put away each day, within 5 years there would be no circulating coins. Of course increase in price would tend to change some holders into sellers.
@_date: 2015-07-15 00:36:11

Yes, words are mutable but why not just call it a scam instead of the more specific Ponzi Scheme? BTW, you sound like someone who might enjoy reading the book by Mitch Zukoff Ponzi's Scheme. I think Zukoff was actually able to find people who had met him, like a niece or nephew. From this book I got the impression that Ponzi was basically an honest man lacking in sophistication, able to thrive in the 1920s when there was a lot of money and a lot of people interested in investing. (Indeed, this is a concern about Bitcoin -- I am a believer but maybe it has done so well for some of the same reasons the stock market in the 1920s has. Having said that, the difference is that the average Bitcoin holder is probably of above-average sophistication.)

It's not that obvious to me. Only a few reasons exist to acquire and subsequently spend Bitcoin and relatively few people need to do this.
The more acceptors of Bitcoin there are the more likely it is that a holder who was thinking of selling Bitcoin to get fiat to then subsequently spend will instead just spend the Bitcoin directly and then we will be where you suggest we already are but I don't think we are near to it yet.
Let me know when weed dealers decide Bitcoin is a better way to go than spending money on Brinks trucks and armed guards -- that will be a good sign.

It is companies like these, dealing with large transactions, that I think will be the future of Bitcoin. A small number of high-value transactions vs many small-value transactions.
The idea that you need to be able to buy a coffee at Starbucks with Bitcoin or it is a failure is absurd to me.
EDIT: Please tell me why this is downvoted. Is it required that Bitcoin work for microtransactions for it to be usable? I also want it to help low-income, unbanked people and if that is why I was downvoted, I understand. Or am I technically incorrect and Bitcoin will have no problem handling many small transactions?
@_date: 2015-07-25 00:57:42
While precise amounts are impossible to say, I want to bring up again the idea that it seems likely that a significant number of these coins end up in the pockets of long-term holders.

At one time, electricity was indeed limited to the home of the very rich; the poorer people continued to use older methods such as kerosine and gas (both lousy alternatives indeed if you read about them in for example the book The Age of Edison).
So I think whether people like it or not, Bitcoin might start out being a practical solution to the problems of small businesses and then later help the very poor and unbanked. Small business owners are often not rich and often employ poor people.

I don't think news (short of something truly major like Greece mandating that BTC is the national currency or something) can have a permanent effect; I think it is users and their usage that have lasting effect upon price. I think it very likely that **many more Greeks know about Bitcoin now than say a month ago.** The long-term effect should be greater demand. But the 20% pop we saw did not come from 20% more users -- that will take a while.
I hope that just as we "languished" in the low 200s for a long time we might now stay in the mid-to-high 200s for a while. That for me would be an acceptable effect from the recent news.
@_date: 2015-07-19 11:43:24
often the diff is 4 dollars and sometimes they are quite close. I think for a while it was Bitstamp that was the lower price. I have no idea why these things happen or what it means. I think even with the time it takes to get coins from the exchanges and the costs, a large difference can be exploited by selling short in the high priced exchanged and going long in the lower priced -- I think there is a guaranteed if small profit which may be why this situation is caused if indeed it can be caused deliberately.

Maybe teenage Filipinos are the ones who will jump on this new stuff. Or someone there.
One important point: A poor nation seeing a technology that has a chance to help its citizens hold onto more of their money ought to be ripe for a technology like Bitcoin.
And lets stop implying that Bitcoin is too volatile for people to risk dealing with. Firstly, volatility works both ways and secondly, the graph for the past three months shows a price history that does not look scary at all. And as more people start buying Bitcoin, the volatility should start diminishing. This is quite different than a long-term upward trend -- you can have tremendous appreciation without the roller-coaster ride of volatility.
@_date: 2015-07-08 09:00:29
I have heard so many people say this. I disagree for more than one reason -- the one I am most clear about is simply that I was not saying people are holding all of their BTC, just some.
But I suppose that if most people who own BTC are unwilling to spend it, then the lack of demand means few merchants will accept BTC. 
However, I never thought the purpose of BTC was for everyday transactions. I think it is most useful for things like remittances and eventually for an international currency that avoids the cost of conversion. What the Irish company is doing with Greece may end up being huge.
Don't worry if you can't buy coffee with Bitcoin; I don't think in the near-term future that is what it is particularly useful for.

That's right. However. if you use Coinbase for a large number of purchases or receive a large number of deposits maybe in a suspect price range, Coinbase will ask you I think. Moreover, haven't people reported problems when they have tried to fund a gambling site? How did Coinbase determine this?
Bottom line, Coinbase should not be used as a wallet. It should be used to buy and sell BTC.

That is interesting. It is counter-intuitive to me that say WU could openly state: "We plan to adversely affect the Bitcoin network by a DDOS attack -- we see Bitcoin as a threat to our business and consider this a legitimate response." And a company like Coinbase whose business would certainly be adversely affected could not sue and certainly could not attempt to in turn flood WU with say fraudulent transactions somehow without expecting legal consequences.
You may be right but am I stating the situation correctly? WU can do what it wants but Coinbase can't respond in kind or sue?

Ironically, the bigger/more expensive the safe, the better an indication to thieves that you have something worth stealing.
I remain amazed that the legal pot industry has yet to embrace BTC (Last I checked -- the one guy interviewed said he did not want the volatility. Maybe they are changing their minds and selling their huge safes and cancelling their contracts with armored car companies.)

This has been mentioned here: People look at Greece and decide they want money in a form that can't be confiscated. If you have ever had a bunch of money in cash after a while you realize you do not want it in your house because of theft. Bitcoin is an alternative many will consider -- way more will consider it now than they would have two months ago.
Now to read the blog and see if they said what I just said.

Wouldn't you say that the lie or misrepresentation must be, in order for the scam to actually be a "Ponzi Scheme", that the dividends not come from the result of actual business activity other than subsequent investments? Just any lie is not enough?
Ponzi actually thought he could do something with international postage coupons that guaranteed profit and when he had investors clamoring to give him money, it was so easy to pay the earlier investors whom he had promised a return from the later investors. He *planned* to do the postage thing (which would not have worked due to limitations on the amount you could purchase) but meanwhile he did the only thing he could to "fulfill" his promises.
Unlike Madoff, it is my impression that Ponzi was naive at first and then over-confident at the end.

Last year, also in Vegas, for WSOP, I posted about the friendly and helpful BTCers who came to my hotel and bought enough from me to keep me there another few days. This really did save *my* ass (or at least save me from having to return home) and in my very last one-table 1K satellite, I was leading from the first hand -- had an ace come on the river I might have had a great story to tell.
Anyway, my very first transactions outside of an exchange showed me what kind of community BTC holders seem to be. That the transactions with complete strangers went so well was a big part of my decision to subsequently buy more and the time turned out pretty good.

My favorite part of this story is Tesla's magnanimous gesture of tearing up his contract with Westinghouse which would have made NT rich if it would not have bankrupted GW's company. Why NT did not just renegotiate the contract instead of destroying it will baffle generations (sort of a pun) to come -- NT could have lived out his life in the luxury he deserved. (I do believe GW out of a sense of fairness supported NT in his old age but only in a very modest way -- NT may have also rejected charity.)

How do we know that it is day trading? That's what some keep saying but where is the evidence?
But even if 90% was day trading (which I doubt since the price is stable for long periods) the 10% that goes into the pockets of holders ends up making a significant dent in the supply and as I said, would completely absorb all BTC within 5 years or so.
Until the supply does dry up, I think it might appear to be business as usual (maybe some tool could analyze the blockchain and reveal just how many BTC are in fact going into long-term storage) followed by a very sudden price increase as parties that must purchase BTC as part of their business bid up the price.

I at first thought what you say here; but when the couple in the "Car of the Future" stop along the highway (probably near Barstow on the way to Vegas where they filmed all that stuff, I think) the scientist says something like, "Please give me some water, I have *gold*" he expires before the guy can help him. Then his wife says, "Gold? Didn't they used to use that as money?" and her husband says, "Yeah, until they figured out how to make as much as they wanted of it." So the scientist/bank robber dies without knowing the gold is worthless.
Of course: He could have sold his suspended animation process or lived on in a future where everyone is free from want. But instead he was in a Twilight Zone episode where, for example, they make suspended animation capsules out of plain, breakable glass.

The question is not really about collectibles -- it is using collectibles as an analogy for BTC and altcoins. In particular, the question is whether, just like limited edition comic books, platinum Israel 25th anniversary coins and I guess 1990s BB cards (about which I know nothing but I am assuming they were created to capitalize upon 1960s and earlier cards) you can create a collectible intentionally. I think not.
I think the following point, made by someone else, is extremely interesting: If by creating a new altcoin you can undermine BTC and presumably replace it with this new altcoin, doesn't this paradoxically make the new altcoin almost instantly of no value itself?
So I think maybe Bitcoin's value won't last but I don't think you can create a valuable one (without backing it by gold or something) out of thin air like Bitcoin's value was created; I think that was a unique historical event.

How can you conclude there was no lasting effect?
In my own case, the first step was buying BTC at Coinbase and at that point I had no idea (I mean I basically knew but they were just abstract -- I did not know how to use the BTC they represented) what the numbers in my account meant. Then I needed to raise money when I was in Vegas and sold 4 BTC to a couple of people who came by my hotel -- going through that process was very edifying.
Finally, I actually moved BTC from Coinbase to my own wallet and that process really clarified things.
So many of those MIT people have a much better idea about BTC than they had before, doesn't that sound reasonable?

I understand. Obviously the address is not secure enough to buy.
But it is surprising what people consider collectible -- that (being surprising) is almost a requirement or people would never have destroyed enough of them to make them rare. 10 cent comic books, baseball cards, coins like old pennies that people wouldn't bend over to pick up.
So if you could demonstrate that you hold a coin that was formerly one of Satoshi's, I wouldn't go spending it without thought. Someone might pay extra for it. Maybe you wouldn't but there are people who buy 100 dollar bills with interesting serial numbers, like all zeros and a 1 is worth a lot, I understand.
But this is the only collectible I can think of that would go down in value each time it traded hands.

What if some country decides not only is Bitcoin legal but finds it valuable to it economy. At that point what would a US government attack on Bitcoin mean? 
I don't even thinks it's likely the US feds will do anything against Bitcoin but if it does, it is already limited in the sort of steps it can take. At worst, it can limit the legality in the USA but things like interfering with it technically ("51% attack" or whatever people mention in this context) seem very unlikely.

The implication by some is the divisibility means that the supply is unlimited and this affects the value adversely; this is wrong.

**Question:** Isn't there a way of doing escrow that does not involve entrusting your Bitcoin to a third party? That is to say, you don't have to put your Bitcoin at an address controlled completely by any of the parties but rather the BTC move only when all 3 parties agree? (So no advantage in screwing anyone?)
Maybe that is what this service does but if so, things should end up okay. That is, no one is actually stealing BTC?

How could honest cloud mining ever yield a better return than say, putting the money in the bank? The mining operation needs money to pay the bills and you provide this but barring a huge run-up in the price of BTC, I don't see why the investor would make much.
And even if there were a big price increase, depending upon the terms of your agreement with the mining guys, you might not get a chunk of this appreciation.
You make huge money from speculative investments that end up paying off, not from well-understood things like mining.

And for the entire quarter, the fairly narrow trading range I think should -- and this can easily be looked up -- cause options premiums or whatever instruments merchants use to hedge, to become less dear and this is a very good thing. Do you agree?

I made a post that was not well-received and maybe I did not phrase it very well. But the basic idea is, it just should not take very long for Bitcoin, in a very natural way, to rise. Not many BTC vs, for example, the world population. But there are also not very many BTC vs the number of people who have used them at least once  -- could 1 million people have used Bitcoin so far? If so, if everyone of them decided they just had to have 15, the price would rocket.
If the current sellers consist in large part of early adopters, then we can assert with reasonable certainty that this supply should dry up pretty soon. (Big "if" but maybe someone knows.) Once that supply is done with, I think pretty fast rise.
But this effect would be dwarfed by many people finding out about Bitcoin in a positive way and certainly Bitcoin has had a lot of bad news to weather. We may get past the effects of this news soon, also.
@_date: 2015-04-06 04:42:39

I agree that people need to be behind things like money -- that's why a company-sponsored money will fail just like scrip issued by a mining company only has value as long as it can be *forced* upon the workers in the company store.
But Samsung using the Blockchain (not its own) just like anyone else sounds reasonable. Starting their own Blockchain -- how would that even work? Where do the maintainers (the miners) come from? Its like trying to start your own Internet like Prodigy sort of tried.

It's not like tipping here precludes tipping elsewhere.
But I agree, tip elsewhere. Tip people in BTC who are bright enough to research enough to access the coins.
I was thinking to tip one waitress who expressed interest an unusually large X-Mas time tip say 100 bucks in BTC which is large enough to compensate her for the time it takes her to learn about it and then maybe tip her and others more modestly at the same restaurant so that she can help others learn.
But honestly, I don't know quite how to she would go about accessing the tip. Would she actually google it or just give up?

Maybe a synergistic effect would be that this helps the impoverished (by increasing their wealth) and in turn the number and value of transactions increases.
Africa has for centuries been a continent that with few exceptions has had what amounts to huge economic problems and maybe something like Bitcoin, etc. will help turn this around.
And consider post-WW2 Japan: Hard to imagine a country in worse shape financially. Japan was able to turn this around within a generation. Part of this was due to the help given it by the USA but another part was that they started from scratch: they did not have to contend with old systems that everyone was used to but rather could start using the latest technologies immediately.
Maybe Africa will be able to emulate Japan thanks to things like the Internet and Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-04-04 23:30:15
I agree with you; but what I am trying to figure is how a company could make money by helping people use BTC directly. It seems like the existing companies actually benefit by BTC *not* being used as money which is not what BTC longs want at all. The only actual users of BTC in the remittance scenario are the companies themselves when it could literally be thousands of individuals in Mexico and the Philippines as well as the USA. (And it is really more like 10s or 100s or thousands of potential BTC users.)
I think it will happen but I am not sure remittance companies are helping very much.

I like Bitcoin more than "value transfer protocol" for to make someone understand that Bitcoin isn't really a coin (I think that's what u are getting at) might be off-putting.

I don't think everyone is buying: it would take very limited buying to cause a big increase in price. I think many businesses and miners and also thieves and early adopters are selling. The early adopter selling should dry up and stability might help with business and miner selling but we are nowhere near what things would look like if buying greatly outweighed selling -- I guess stability implies buys and sells about equal out.

@_date: 2015-09-15 08:07:25
I sure think so. I can't imagine how someone with no technical experience could learn how to use Electrum (the only wallet I have tried) on their own.
Here's a big part of the problem: Because this involves money, new users in the learning phase will be extremely reluctant to experiment which is of course very helpful way to learn. I could see people becoming paralyzed, afraid they will lose coins by accident and ultimately out of fear and frustration, give up.
A simple thing with Electrum should be moving BTC from an address you control into the wallet. Maybe there is a way other than the "sweep" option under the "private key" option, but afaik, that is the only way.
I know why the term is "sweep" (I think it is) but I think this could be so much clearer by using a different term on the menu.
Electrum should have a "Get Bitcoin from an Address You Control (you know the private key for)" Option. Verbose but I think many more people would understand this than "sweep" and they might not even find sweep anyway because it is under "private keys", not something like "pull Bitcoin."
Maybe rather than bitching I should fix this, maybe create a verbose UI on top of the existing one. But maybe people will disagree about what needs to be done anyhow.

And my point is, there is sufficient gross volume so that even a modest percentage being held will force a price rise eventually.
But I don't know why people conclude that it is day trading; the source of coins could be people who bought at much lower prices, etc.

If there are parties that have written puts that have a 230 strike and they are near expiration, then such parties have an interest in keeping the price at or above 230. That is but one reason why a stable price is of interest to some.
As has been mentioned many times before, stability is even better for Bitcoin than a rising price -- I forget stolfi's exact argument, but he mentioned merchants planning or something.
Isn't the invisible hand idea that the market itself will do things that appear to be the actions of an individual or small number of people? 
A really far out idea would be that the market is acting like a self-interested creature and somehow understands that stability is the best thing for Bitcoin and hence the best thing for a market in Bitcoin. I don't find it compelling here but I do think that there are real life examples of systems in for example the biosphere that behave just that way.
For example, if a forest has existed for millennia, through droughts and fires, actual systems must have developed that protect the forest. Watched over time, the system appears to be intelligent and in fact, maybe in some sense it actually is.
Maybe in some sense a complex thing like a forest is both conscious and intelligent. Maybe in some sense it can even be communicated with.
But I digress.

Yes, if it works like margin loans, the brokerage is monitoring the value of securities and will either ask for more collateral or liquidate some of it. The reason why liquidation works btw is because the value of the shares is usually considered to be 50% of the market value for margin purposes whereas the resultant fiat is 100%.
I mention this because with multiple currencies shifting in value, it seems to me that margin loans is really complicated. Why would turning BTC into dollars be preferred over keeping it in BTC? The answer I guess would be in this simple case because it is dollars that were borrowed and that is what needs to be paid back but I can imagine more complex situations.
In the stock market, not all shares are equally marginable and the marginability is based on various factors which change all the time. I think at one time shares trading below 5 bucks could not be borrowed against which as a rule of thumb sounds okay but then the internet bubble came along and we saw that just because a stock is trading for 100 bucks one day doesn't mean it won't be worth 5 bucks a week later.

This is similar to a chilling problem we have in USA. One instance was a winner in a Nevada casino stopped by a cop for going 78 in a 75 mph zone, something that would normally not happen. The conclusion is that the casino informed the cop who then pulled the driver over and gave him the option of surrendering the cash and keeping his vehicle or else the cop would confiscate (under the pretext of the money being the potential proceeds from drug sales based on drug dog sniffing the cash) both and the guy would never get the money back.
Summary: Carrying a lot of cash is dangerous not just from criminals but also "law enforcement."

The idea is not much of one -- just to sell something else via infomercial.
I think the key is the right artist. Here's the really interesting part:
There already are people selling as art fake money. This is selling as art something that also has value encoded.
**Here is a very, very important idea:** The people who are selling wallets that have denominations printed on them so that they look like money are making a big mistake. They should just be artwork that happens to be a wallet. If they make it look like money, they run into counterfeiting laws.

No sarcasm. I am genuinely impressed that Bitcoin facilitated trade between two countries which I think are either in a technical state of war or at least Dubai does not recognize Israel in any official way. If Dubai is not the best example, maybe Iraq when Saddam was in power was: Iraq would not have pissed on Israel if it was on fire.
But with Bitcoin, a company could hire an Israeli software developer and paid him -- business between people in countries in a state of war.
I've read that war never occurred between two countries each of which had a McDonalds. If that is true, maybe Bitcoin becomes the way for business relationships to form between people and circumvent governments. Enough such ties and maybe it would hard to get people to go to war.
Here's what would be cool: Find out that a bunch of software developers in Israel are working for some company in Iran. (Probably there is not enough trust for this to happen but who knows.)
**Summary:** No sarcasm was intended but I am high.

I have observed that generally speaking, interest rate reductions make commodities and the stock markets go up. If increasing rates increases the return one can get from a certificate of deposit, in that sense money is worth more.

One more thing: I never believed in TA for stocks. There are so many reasons that even if TA worked for stocks, the effects would be very secondary because of fundamentals like earnings. However, price, in particular price *stability,* **is a fundamental** for Bitcoin. Stability allows predictability and this makes businesses dealing with Bitcoin much more comfortable. And as mentioned, those merchants who hedge find that long periods of stability make this hedging cheaper and this may make the difference between choosing to adopt Bitcoin or not.
EDIT: I have not found a page that shows historical options prices for Bitcoin. If someone has a link, we should be able to see very clearly that prices have gone down. I think the prices would have to be normalized because Bitcoin itself has dropped since the previous year, so the price of options as a percentage of the underlying BTC price should be lower.

Do you agree about impact? When we talk about making BTC simpler, I would guess wallets are the primary area; the genuinely complex stuff related to mining is meant for technical people but a wallet should work as easily as a physical wallet: put money in, take it out.

There is not enough Bitcoin to go around. Coinbase volume alone will absorb every Bitcoin so far minted within 5 years. I think steep rises are easy to visualize.
I don't know what the current source of Bitcoin being sold currently is, but it can't last forever.

I don't see England as attempting to control/fight China with opium (not opiates which did not yet exist) -- England wanted to be able to trade with China which wanted little of what England had to sell.
That is not to say that opium was end in fact functioning as a weapon against China in conflicts but those very conflicts arose due to China's resistance against it. 
I am not convinced opium is much of a weapon. Many people function with it. Railroad workers in USA from China used it; RR still got built.

That number came from the scenario where BTC is used for the same amount of economic activity that the dollar is (or something) and dividing this number by 21 million. So 21 trillion dollars is some big percentage of the world annual GDP.
Anyway, pretty unlikely that BTC could be so frigging huge and there would be big technical hurdles.
Having said this: There are huge companies worth a trillion dollars and the top 100 companies in the world are worth many trillions of dollars so it is not completely crazy for something to be worth 21 trillion dollars.

Sort of interesting and I note that the Futures markets might be related to his idea.
Indeed, money is a very interesting thing and ideas about it have changed a lot. I was re-reading Levenson's book about Newton, which focuses on his tenure at the Mint. Apparently paper money was just introduced in England in the late 1600s and was initially greeted with skepticism since people were used to silver and gold coins. But paper money indeed caught on.
I can't see how something like Bitcoin will not be an important form of money in the future; even more obvious to me is that money will continue to change and the Internet and its future forms will probably require new forms of money/payments.
In other words, it's crazy to imagine we have seen the end of change in money and Bitcoin seems like it has come along at the right time indeed.

Just to be clear: 42 BTC is 1/500000 of the total number of BTC. The number of people in the world who could own that number once all BTC are issued is then 500,000 which (out of 7 billion humans) makes one not one in 500,000 but one in 14,000.

I think some people who have made a big profit are gradually selling whereas indeed there are some people holding.

My point is, there are enough coins traded to potentially completely soak up all BTC within a short time and what then?

Last post to you ever: People buy and hold. Okay? Even on an exchange. In fact, for stocks, that's pretty much the only way to obtain stock. Not every trade results in coins being held, but some do.
Making money by trading BTC is something that very few people are successful in doing. The high frequency trading thing that is done on stock exchanges would not be feasible because the volume is too small. And of course high frequency stock trading is not a guaranteed way to make money.
In summary, even though it is called an exchange, some people just buy -- they are under no obligation to subsequently sell on that exchange.

My one concern is that the companies using Bitcoin for remittances will actively try to discourage this. 
The real way to do this is to get paid in BTC and if you need to send money home to mom just sending it to her also in BTC. No third party involved. This requires some supermarket chain in, for example, the Philippines accepting BTC. The first one that does that should get a huge bump in revenues as Filipinos in the USA who get paid in BTC deposit their money in an account that their mom can draw on.

The ones that you have to trace extensively would be worth a lot less if I am right about "old" coins or coins from particular addresses being collector's items at all.

Remember in Manhattan if you pay less than 300/night for a hotel room you will be taking your chances and a nice (basic room in a 5 *) room is probably 800-1k nowadays.

Coinbase is doing something like 30 or 40 million. There seems to be a lot of activity. The 3600 BTC created each day is a small fraction of the total activity.  I really think the coins are gradually moving into the pockets of long-term holders.

At the current volumes, assuming a significant portion of the Bitcoin end up in the hands of long-term holders, there is not very much Bitcoin. For example, if 50k Bitcoin trade each day and half of them get held, then about 8 million end up unavailable at the end of just one year. In 3 years, every single Bitcoin that will be minted would be hoarded.

But even if we are talking publicly traded companies in USA, Apple is half a trillion (and once you could have bought the whole thing for less than .1% of that I think) so the top 20 might be ten trillion so the argument that Bitcoin can't be worth 21 trillion because no 100 top companies are worth 21 trillion is not valid. That is quite different that saying Bitcoin must be worth 21 trillion because some collection of companies is worth that. That doesn't hold much water to me.
@_date: 2015-04-19 01:43:13
There is no such investment that could be shown to be worth 10 times its current price in 5 years because then obviously it would be under-priced now.
But what I think is very likely true is that it will be worth either quite a bit more or quite a bit less (like zero) in five years time. The odds (to me) therefore seem to be very good.
If the value of BTC is proportional roughly to usage, it seems like  at least 10 times as many people in 5 years using it would be hard *not* to have happen. Given that it is not outlawed or some altcoin catches on, etc.

I understand that these loans are uncollateralized and even the best intentions on the part of borrowers can't be monetized. But if it works, great, a use case for BTC which I am always in favor of.
What makes sense to me BTW is loaning people fiat with BTC being the collateral. I for example would love to be able to raise money without liquidating my BTC holdings since there is a big expense in selling them and buying them back later. But so far, i have only been able to sell BTC for fiat.

That does not mean that there are trading methods that apply. I am in fact skeptical that anyone knows based enough about Bitcoin to trade it successfully.
There are chartists that swear by this method and there are people say that such methods are completely useless.
There is a Nobel Prize (in Economics) winner who made completely wrong predictions about Bitcoin's future and I guess he knows a decent amount about markets.
I am making a very limited claim. The true part is that people who want to accumulate it are doing so. The speculative part is what this means but it seems pretty reasonable that this should make the price go up a lot as long as volumes keep increasing.

I was seriously interested in 2011 in buying on SR. But in those days the only way I could find to buy BTC were too hard to be worth the effort I thought. I also suggested it to friends who did nothing. Crazy -- almost impossible to have not made a small fortune then. Unless: I thought of BTC as poker chips and I might have just cashed the unspent balance out. I will never know now.
But I am convinced the current price is not the final price. Either way higher or at most 250 bucks lower.

If the price continues at last 30 day's rate I think it works out to be 1000 to 1 within a year. Sounds unlikely but what if the price movement is not base on speculation but rather a process (at least in part)? Then the price might grow significantly no matter how crazy it seems.

@_date: 2015-11-01 13:27:28
I did not mean to imply that you made that argument but since people often reply to threads in the middle, I am being proactive.
You are saying that the huge volume comes from legitimate daytrading activity, not an attempt to fake volumes.
I am not convinced that most people who engage in daytrading make money at it but that doesn't mean they aren't doing it, so sure, maybe we are not seeing trades between long-term holders and daytraders (although long-term holders not buying from daytraders I don't think can be shown) but mainly daytraders trading among themselves.
But I think tools exist or could be created that could characterize this activity, showing how long coins involved in transactions stay at the next address and this would allow us to understand whether the supply of coins is gradually drying up or not. Another thing that would be looked at is BTC days destroyed -- if the source of coins is from long-term holders liquidating and as mentioned, this source is not inexhaustible.
@_date: 2015-04-20 04:42:42
Probably. I am most interested in introducing BTC to people who have never heard of it but then I run into the problem of them usually having a lot of problems dealing with the technical stuff like wallets, etc. (and this is for bright guys who just are not software oriented).

I don't know what it is certainly true that volumes are way up. They *should* have that feature, I agree.

@_date: 2015-11-01 09:59:41
If one person owns every Bitcoin except one, then the remaining Bitcoin would have to suffice for all purposes and a single Bitcoin (even the ones held by that one person) would be very valuable. The fact that the big holder could sell at any point would be a threat but in the meantime, the price has been artificially increased.
If it was known that the one big holder had lost the keys for all those coins, then I would guess the value of the single circulating coin would be very high indeed.

Would it ironically ever be the same USMS that sold BTC trying to get them outlawed?
Or would it be the USMS unloads their BTC and then Homeland Security tries to get BTC outlawed? 
I think your point is that the US government is more or less omnipotent but we do still have the 3 branches of government.
Summary: USMS having sold BTC (in huge, maybe the largest single sellers)  makes it harder for BTC to be outlawed.

I see a leap in both but the real peak is network volume. If it is faked, I guess it is meaningless but the fact that it is coincident with exchange volumes that are also peaking, I think it is probably not fake.
Please give me you take on why Chinese exchanges are attempting to exaggerate volume figures by buying and selling the same coins over and over. What is the point in this other than attempting to make the exchanges look busy? Even given that this is valuable, how valuable is it once it is disclosed that the volume is fake? Wouldn't an exchange faking volumes make one have second thoughts about using such an exchange?

Absolutely! In how many works of fiction are we presented with two dangerous and dishonest men each willing to rather than exchange goods, simply kill the other party and take the goods.
Imagine that you now have a solution where both parties can enter a room and be sure, unless the other person was completely crazy, that they would emerge completely safe and with the agreed upon goods exchanged.
It would make honest men out of the worst criminals (at least in this context).

We have no experience with actual aliens but interestingly, the common ancestor of the octopus and humans did not even have a brain and yet both the octopus and humans have brains.
I think aliens will use Bitcoin for sure based on the foregoing. Maybe already are but if not, the demand created for Bitcoin by aliens should cause at least a 20 percent increase and I am being conservative.

I said "victimless" not legal. Sadly there is a difference.
The USA spends a fortune not just trying (with zero success) to prevent victimless crimes but crimes that aren't even crimes in many nations. Imagine that prostitution is still illegal throughout the USA (with trivial exceptions) and that gay sex was also illegal not just here but even in England (and look at what happened to Turing because of these sickening laws).

I bet u are a chess player.
I think that Bitcoin might be more suited to technical analysis than stocks. Stocks have news, earnings and can also issue more shares. A commodity with a finite number of units might have patterns that do indeed suggest future performance.
If that is true and something simple like extrapolation works for Bitcoin than any holder would be crazy to sell and everyone who doesn't own any should buy some. In fact, if you are a holder you should buy all you can.
This is assuming that daily 2% or more increases on every week day for the past month or so means something about what will happen tomorrow. If it just keeps happening, it sure would feel compelling.

At least 20 percent. Hell, if aliens come and they have enough to trade, I could see us back into the 600s.

Idealistic maybe, but: If improving remittance processing helps the economies of these countries, that could potentially help Bitcoin itself.
I don't see fiat to BTC to fiat being the ultimate approach -- I see people being paid in BTC and then sending it essentially for free to family back home. **That** will be a great way to handle remittance.
But for now, if BTC improves the existing process somewhat, great.

I hope you are right of course and it seems like all it takes are more uses (let alone speculators) for the available BTC than can be supported by this supply to make the price go up. But the current price may still reflect a lot of optimism. 
I don't think it's a sure thing by any means but to many people there is value in holding BTC as a gold-like store of value -- for me, if I knew 100% that in 5 years time the price would still be what it is today, I could justify BTC as a much safer than a mattress "virtual mattress".
If I were a Russian (as a good example), there must been literally a dozen reasons that immediately come to mind for putting serious money into BTC. It is clear why Rubles or gold are completely inadequate if you live in an unstable nation like that.
This is why it is not crazy/paranoid to believe that there are those deliberately trying to undermine stability of BTC.
Because if you asked 100 Russians: Would you buy Bitcoin if you were guaranteed that in 5 years it would have the same buying power (rent/food/gas) -- no appreciation, just safety, how many do you think would say, "yes" ?

A non-trivial advance for Bitcoin! Significant effect upon mindshare in a demographic that probably is above average income-wise and above average in terms of influencing others, also.

These are all interesting. The fact is with any new invention there is not a compelling need since society had previously gotten along without it. The phone not only had telegraph as already established competitor but people probably at first considered it weird/rude to "call" upon someone via telephone.
So does Bitcoin share important features with any of these eventually highly successful inventions? At first it will seem like there is no need: you can do with credit cards already what can be done with Bitcoin. But to me this is a no-brainer -- I don't need to go into the downsides of credit cards.
One really important similarity to early telephone history and Bitcoin: In the same way that there were few uses for the phone because not many people had them, Bitcoin users have relatively few places to spend BTC. But that problem will be solved with time.

If indeed that's what that value indicates then Electrum could be more clear (here and in other cases).
I am just starting to become comfortably with most of Electrum's usage but not all. I am certainly not a very bright person but I have worked as a software developer for a long time and so if I am having trouble understanding what is going on, anyone non-techie with significant BTC held in Electrum might flip out.
Electrum should reassure the user when appropriate: "Zero confirmations -- that's often okay, please give it at least 10 minutes." Or even "Confirmations will continue to accumulate but 1 or 2 is enough in most cases."
Stuff like that.

I have been through some good and bad times in the equity markets. I realize my own judgement is terrible.
My reasoning on BTC however is that if it is worth something intrinsically, because of it utility for remittance and other things, it just has to be worth a lot more than it is today. No way 250 is the eventual price -- way more or basically zero.
So I like those odds.
Frankly, I am worried about how much time I have wasted posting and watching the price and I really plan to stop doing it so much.

I never liked Chumlee and here's why: I think he is not a nice person. The idea is that he is an "amiable dunce" but when he had the opportunity to bully or act like an jerk, he does. He is also not funny even though the show is scripted. In fact, I don't really like any of the 4 main characters although I have to hand it to Rick: he envisioned the show and it is a huge success AFAIK. There are also quite a few things he knows a lot about. I guess the Old Man must have had something on the ball at one point since he started it; probably Rick was the ambitious "visionary" maybe even needing to fight his dad to expand into TV.

Investing is about not putting all your eggs in one basket. The more things you own that have a shot of going up massively (while the most you can lose is the investment itself) the better.
I have seen basically two generations be born and mature and each of them would have done fine by putting their money in mutual funds that track the Dow. I think there has never been a 10 year period in which the Dow did not go up significant since the end of the Great Depression (a hell of a time to have bought).
Caveat: Maybe this will be the first generation that this advice will not work out for.
But by all means, put some in BTC and make sure it is under your direct control!!! (Your own address and don't lose the keys!!!)

I think the line is incredibly easy to draw: The two sides had an agreement: one side violated that agreement. By this simple criterion, the coins were stolen.

More people are bad/greedy than you might imagine. I met and spoke with Russ Hamilton, the WSOP champ who shamelessly (even proudly) stole even from friends. I had not vibe from him that he would do that sort of thing. Guess my default is to assume the worst.

It is true that 300 usd is probably more significant that 300 gbp. but i am not convinced that the important thing is the price as much as the volume. sure, it is more likely that a big holder put in a limit sell at 300 or crossing 300 made holders think about selling but i think volume indicates demand for BTC.
anyway, staying above 300 for a while will make me feel better.
i have also noticed that weekends are periods of pullback recently.

What I meant about trading: I don't know how long this market was around but if it was, say, a month you might have had time to buy stuff, have it delivered and enjoyed. And then, in addition, when the market disappeared you also got whatever funds were left back. Then no complaints, right?
As far as lottery: We got to have a way that means maybe you don't get what you want always but if you don't, at a minimum there is no incentive to cheat because of escrow and if that works, why wouldn't you in fact be reimbursed?

Ownership can be effected by having very good security and you being the only one with passwords. Your partners overseas who deploy your code and manage the servers cooperate because you have these passwords.
Fuck contracts and regulations. Build everything into the code.
People are basically honest but the problem often is interpretation of agreements. Make the code manage that.
Remove temptation by having everything worked out in code and you don't even have to discuss what your share is and what the other guy's share is. In case of disagreements, have a third partner who exists to resolve ties.

Then, for each name, some sort of random mixture or merging with something else, like an old phone number.
You could write a program that would generate all names in various order, but I think if you add a simple additional component, it would be very hard to "guess" the pass phrase.
Sure, phrases from novels won't work, but tell me how to break the code. If you are will to put money on it, I'll deposit some BTC at an address and you can try.

trying to think of a law harder to enforce. the nature of btc makes the purchase in exchange, for example, for work rather than fiat almost undetectable/untraceable. only when one attempts to convert to fiat in person can you be readily caught. and even then: someone wants money and has btc and someone on the opposite side can have such compelling reasons that they will figure out a way. drug traffic has not stopped in russia and that is in theory (assuming cops want to stop it) far easier to detect.

Based up what info do you make that assertion?
I suspect a lot of sales are merchants or businesses that get BTC from merchants. If most people, meaning individuals, are people like me then the bid/ask and fees mean that 10 or 20 dollar move upward is not enough for them to sell.
I put BTC in a place that a quick sale is virtually impossible.

If it is worthwhile to build apps on it it implies that BTC itself is both valuable and probably increasingly so.

But the spam "attack" or experiment that we saw was indeed a big jump in transactions without there being a coincident volume increase.
I guess parties could be faking volumes (some say that Chinese exchanges are doing just that although I still don't know why) but Coinbase and some other exchanges I think are not faking transactions and Coinbase in particular is showing a huge percentage jump in Bitcoin volume: I think they broke 20k BTC in a single day and even the last 24 hours was over 15k; a big day last month was about half that.

How much is that? 15 bucks? 
I was once living in greatly reduced circumstances (one day I found a five-dollar bill on the ground and that was the first time I was not hungry that week, to give you an idea) and was buying Starbucks "lunch boxes" or whatever you call them. I did not have any ability to cook and they at least tasted pretty good. But when you look at the caloric and nutritional content, they are ridiculously expensive. I lost probably 15% of my body weight within 3 months eating that way.

Thanks. I guess this shows how fast things can change -- if Bitcoin were already "mature" (not that I have heard that) I think it would be much harder for such quick improvements to occur. I would guess this means Gemini is making already in the low thousands of dollar per day.
This means there is yet another entity with a stake in Bitcoin and the means to help promote it.

I don't think so -- without some reason, how is a stable price arrived at? I suggest that the price must come from some "organic" cause. If you say the price reflects absence of speculation, that suggests that a fair price is the current price.

Is it part of any company's business plan to hold on this a significant part of their revenue or do even conventional companies tend to cash for expanding the business and paying dividends.
It is more normal for individuals to hold on to cash, not businesses.
Now if a BTC-accepting company converts BTC to fiat and then holds on to the fiat "for a rainy day" or whatever, that would be disappointing.
@_date: 2015-03-11 05:42:15

I wonder if market makers will not only be seen to be unnecessary not only for Bitcoin but also for new kinds of securities. 
I would even wonder if market makers no longer are important for traditional securities markets. Wouldn't computers make their function less and less important?
EDIT: This link talks about the lessening importance of market makers several years ago. This is why I would think that they would have no place on BTC exchanges: 
@_date: 2015-11-01 13:14:46
I am talking about both. blockchain.info has BTC volume, USD volume (the charts are almost identical not unexpectedly) and also exchange volumes. All the numbers are up very significantly and so if not faked or the result of a "stress test" I think are very meaningful, indicating wider adoption of Bitcoin which can't be bad for price, can it?
@_date: 2015-10-15 18:38:07
I think that usage measured by amount (not transaction) is an important contributing factor (perhaps the main one) to value: people need BTC to do certain things like this and so there is demand for them. What am I missing?
@_date: 2015-11-05 13:26:42
Yup, not only is this a huge relative upward movement (vs the frequent sub-300 days) but over 1200 BTC is a full one third of daily-mined coins. As you said, unlikely these are faked numbers. And as far as other exchanges faking, why fake but then still be significantly less than top exchanges which may be indeed faking? So when Coinbase reports almost 50k BTC daily, I have suspect that a lot of real BTC are being traded and I further think many people using Coinbase are in it for the long haul: Bitcoins supply is indeed tightening.
@_date: 2015-11-01 05:08:49
The number of transactions could be many small "fake" transactions whereas the metric which takes the size in BTC of the transactions into account is not so easily faked although it is asserted that those numbers are exaggerated by the Chinese exchanges making many wash transactions.
But assuming those wash transactions remain about constant, the increases we are seeing (and we are seeing significant increases at exchanges like Coinbase and Gemini and Coinsetter) I think are significant.

What is a plausible scenario where one would get such a loan? One is where the borrower thinks BTC will move down vs say the dollar -- this is what short sellers do purely to speculate.
If one needed BTC to pay someone for example they could buy it but if they needed a loan to do that they would also incur the cost of conversion from fiat to BTC .
@_date: 2015-03-27 05:50:33
i feel what is key is enough usage that speculation begins to be swamped by the need of businesses to hold enough coin for paying employees, etc.
there is a site called elance. i have not checked if the short contracts there ever or never or frequently offer payment in btc but that seem very natural if the payee and payor are in different countries. also the escrow stuff that uses bitcoin is a very natural way to handle the problems that arise in this space.

Here's some things: 
1. The meaning of money has changed a lot over time and I am pretty sure everyone knows that getting people to accept paper not as a promise (for gold or silver) but as money itself was a hard swallow for many when it was first introduced and *remains so* for many *still*.
2. One of the smartest guys in history found understanding money non-trivial. I am speaking about Isaac Newton...
So I would expect the controversy to continue for a long time to come and real economists who are capable and sharp might take opposing views on money and Bitcoin in particular.

Again: But why? And since I believe the volume at Coinbase, which charges fees, must be legit and the volume peaks at Coinbase are coincident with peaks at other exchanges and Blockchain volumes (apart from exchanges) I think that the level of fake transactions is not that high.
@_date: 2015-11-01 12:30:06
I am not sure how we know that it is the same coins over and over. But even if a large part of that volume comes from "fake" trading, my point is the volumes are so large that if only 10% (for example) of the trades are real and then only 10% of those coins end up in the hands of long term holders, it still would not take very long for many Bitcoin to be therefore "out of action."
Now at this point in the argument there are still people who argue that coins being in the hands of long-term holders is immaterial because "you can keep subdividing them" -- I certainly don't think that is true.
But even if limited supply somehow does not affect price, I must then ask, what is responsible for Bitcoins trading at any non-zero price?
I don't think the people arguing against me are sincere; I think they are simply anti-Bitcoin and/or short, etc.
It doesn't matter much to me: I think we are seeing the beginning of a long string of increases and I am telling people why, which is basically volumes everywhere I look are increasing. If you genuinely take issue with the reasoning, fine. But please don't tell me lame things like the number of coins held by hoarders don't matter.

It would be hard to explain Spring in detail here and I am probably not the right person but essentially Spring is a bunch of libraries, some of which are "core" and used by other parts of Spring that make tasks like web development easier by providing code that otherwise would have to be written from scratch.

Possibly the most important article ever about Bitcoin assuming true. If China can't do it, no country can.
If one country regulates the fuck out of BTC or outlaws it completely, worst case is it continues elsewhere -- but even outlawing it can't stop people from using it in the country that tries it. If capital punishment for drug selling hasn't stopped drugs, which have physical evidence, how can it be done with invisible BTC?

I am not understanding the extreme opposition against the attempt to prevent the stolen coins from being spent/transferred.
This is similar to marking bills in ransom or specially marked bills given to unsuspecting bank robbers.
I do see the problems with this affecting fungibility and if indeed the victims could have used escrow to protect themselves, maybe it's just tough for them.
But catching thieves doesn't seem that bad to me either.
@_date: 2015-03-25 09:43:31
Not clear that WU has the funds for this. One could argue literally no one does because as the price gets very near zero people would buy up BTC and the BTC that you need to borrow in order to short became less available.
An entity could attempt to buy all BTC and then bury them effectively but I think this would cause the few hold outs to indeed hold out and some amount of very valuable BTC continue to be available.
A very wealthy entity could make an alternative that was backed by fiat or gold and give it away for less than cost but I don't think that would work either.
Bottom line: Any serious attempt to negatively affect the price of BTC would tend to have the opposite effect especially when it became known that they were doing it.

MY QUESTION EXACTLY. I don't believe it and I think some are legit trades resulting in some BTC ending up in the pockets of long-term holders (maybe starting out in the hands of a company that handles remittance processors) and so the supply will start to dry up.
But remittance processors still need BTC to do business so the prices will continue to rise which is what we are seeing now.
Perhaps there was a supply from very early adopters but 1 billion bucks of BTC has to strain their pockets, especially if this happens every day even at 100 million instead of one billion.

Tell me how you know that anything traded on any exchange must continue to be traded rather than end up in the account of someone who does not subsequently trade it for a long time? Sure some BTC are going back and forth but not all. I don't think you are interested in an honest discussion but on the off chance that you are, explain to me how you know that it just *has* to work the way you think that it does.
Also, the idea that you can trade something back and forth and somehow make money when a commodity is more or less stable baffles me.

It still seems like something that the market itself could do with it being so much easier to put buyers and sellers together. A century ago, it must have been absolutely crucial.
I understand your point about even if done with a computer it's still market making but why does there have to be any entity providing liquidity -- why doesn't a buyer or seller simply get matched with a counterparty?
If no such counterparty exists, why would a market maker be willing to act as one?
@_date: 2015-10-24 09:15:09
But not a huge spread. I am not sure that has much bearing in any case -- what interests me is the rise from low double digits to mid-triple digits in about a month and what this means about Bitcoin demand. It seems to me that there might be a segment of investors who waited for a "legitimate" exchange before buying.
Let's see where the volume is at in another month.
This is but one exchange -- overall volume, in particular the most important one in my opinion: total BTC traded, is trending up and I have to believe that many of those coins will be disappearing into the pockets of long-term holders. This will create upward pressure on price.

The dollar volume is the most important indicator, isn't it? Total transactions is not too meaningful because of spam but I think dollar volume is a very encouraging sign recently.
Stability of price I am convinced leads to merchant adoption but what will be tremendous is development of ecosystems where businesses can buy from suppliers with Bitcoin and thus not need to convert to fiat in some or maybe even many cases.

I agree with you on all counts. I am not sure but it could be that the buyers themselves would rather use BTC than carry cash for a similar if smaller reason than the dispensaries themselves. I just don't know how expensive pot is at these places but given that every single person visiting them is compelled to pay with cash, these dispensaries must be a prime hunting ground for muggers, perhaps waiting a block or so away. Of course the dispensaries are now faced with the choice of expensive physical security (and the implied dangers) or Bitcoin -- that is at this point their only paths as far as I can see.
The first ones start using BTC can compete much more effectively in the marketplace which will spur imitation by their competitors.

What would be the policy that you would want to see in an exchange?
I think No Questions Asked is one that is so double-edged that I would not trust my fiat/BTC with such an exchange.
If individuals provided information to exchanges saying,  (I don't think I am being technically precise here) These BTC originating at this address were accepted by Evo (for example) but I never received the agreed upon goods/services: would you (the exchange) consider:
1. Holding onto those coins until an adjudication can occur
2. Not accepting them
And then the exchange actually did one of those things -- would this be better than simply ignoring the alleged theft victims complaint and accepting the BTC and then selling them swiftly to someone else?
@_date: 2015-02-26 20:29:11

@_date: 2015-11-01 09:34:20
Oops. Corrected. But you seem to be saying that because you can divide Bitcoin into arbitrarily small amounts the fact that the supply decreases is immaterial. I am saying that no matter how small the units, the supply matters. A single Bitcoin can be divided so that everyone in the world could have a piece of the same one. Does this make the BTC that other people own valueless because the single BTC's pieces are enough to go around? If so, why haven't we seen the results of this already?

The answer to both of course is, "yes" but what I mean is just how much better a demonstration of BTC tech in action would be than what did happen which will trouble us all for at least the next year.

Even when I tell you I understand what you are saying, you keep explaining. My central point is, I don't care about lotteries failing -- I care about them helping BTC and I think not tying the price per ticket to fiat of any form -- you start now at a price u think people will pay and stick with it.
Same thing with retailers whose prices in BTC change all the time and who in fact just convert to fiat -- I am not convinced they are doing much for BTC until they keep their BTC receipts and spend them with their suppliers or salaries/bonuses to employees.
Which I think you must agree with if you are interested in BTC's success. And I think it will happen and is already happening a little. Price stability will contribute a lot to changing policy within retailers and we seem to have that now.

@_date: 2015-11-09 13:23:51
I think that government can do things that will discourage things that have seemed to have a positive impact upon BTC price. That is different than stopping usage completely.
For example, if they shut down Coinbase I think you will agree that will be a big negative.
We should all be pleased that exchanges seem to be making a lot of money from BTC -- the exchanges are among our most powerful allies and will holler and have the resources to holler loudly (in a legal sense) because they are making (in Coinbase's case) tens of thousands if not more each day.
This to me is one of the reason I am so optimistic about Bitcoin: every player right now wants even their competitors to do well (I think) -- if I am right, this is a very different dynamic than we have seen except perhaps this might have been true for other major industries. Maybe oil was that way with each player hoping that their competitors would help spread the word about the value of kerosene over whale oil.
Not sure the Internet worked this way or at least to the same degree, perhaps because no one was really opposing the Internet.

Employee Stock Options have the in common the same issue that you mention: You are on hook for taxes for the value of the shares are the time of exercise irrespective of future declines. Many people had serious financial troubles resulting from this.

I don't know about the msb thing you mention. But I always visualize that which is prohibited in one jurisdiction simply migrating to another.
I really love your idea about no need for both parties to be at the ATM simultaneously. I would add that the cash deposited could possibly be sent to a bank rather than a person having to pick up physical cash.
These ATMs could also work such that you would not have to have one transaction be exactly balanced by another -- it is not escrow exactly but I think the idea you mentioned: each machine is its own floating marketplace with people putting in cash and getting out BTC by inputting their own public addresses.
In fact, something like this makes the escrow idea seem sort of stupid/superfluous. All that is needed is a place where cash for BTC or BTC for cash can happen and forget about all the complexity escrow (with matching two parties) introduces. The only issue arises when there is an imbalance but that would not be the first time I went to an ATM that did not have cash available.

Yep. I try to make suggestions to companies (many of which seem like good ideas at the time and then seem stupid after I think about them more -- I am trying to be more careful).
I also have been making suggestions for small-scale business ideas which don't seem to excite people here but maybe they are not the best ideas either.
One thing I suggested long ago was setting up in a small merchant which wants to accept BTC (like a coffee-shop) as a consultant, helping folks with wallets. The merchant benefits or at least doesn't mind and you get a free office and source of customers. I hope people are trying this out. I am sure individuals would be happy to pay a decent hourly rate for quick questions answered in minutes for like 5 bucks a question.

The obvious point is that carrying large amounts of cash are plain dangerous; less obvious is that cops are one of the primary dangers.
Have heard these stories before, but never get tired of them. Until you have actually seen footage/heard the cops, you can't believe it is so blatant.
BTW, the cash can go right into the arresting officer's pocket in the form of a bonus -- this money does not go just to buy new cruisers or shotguns. Not to mention the money taken off the top by the cop (I am sure that never happens, right?)

GDP is a yearly figure so the market cap of companies doesn't directly bear on that.
But I do think about if BTC were a company, it could plausibly have a trillion dollar market cap and that would be great for everyone with 21 or more BTC. 10 Trillion would be even better!

No, I can say 100% that Python is very different syntactically and in other fundamental ways from C++ and Java. But yes, if you know Java, C++ is not too hard and certainly if you know C++, Java is pretty easy (since the history of Java was a language to address some issues with C++).
Tell me why you think knowing Java or C++ gives you Python automatically. I have written a lot of Java code but even understanding Python code well enough to port it to Java let alone create Python from scratch I find really challenging.

@_date: 2015-02-20 05:13:16
The only way I have done it is thru my bank account and now I can buy a small amount instantly (the coins show up before the money is debited from my account).
The way I figure it, if they think they will get paid, why would they ever cancel your purchase? I did have one purchase cancelled but when I asked them they said it was their error and put it through.
Also, and maybe this is significant: I only buy nowadays; I don't use it to trade because I am in it for long-term and also the fees are too high for trading in my account although I think they have a market where you the fees are lower.
What do you think the reason is? Was there ever an insufficient funds issue? Are you buying a lot at one time or very  frequently? (I am not because I don't have the money -- I tend to buy less than or equal to one coin at a time.)
Are you using some method that I don't know about -- that is not a bank account?

It is balance between holders and users. The more it is used, the more people not just know about it but know how to use it and understand that it really can be used for something. If you could magically stop everyone from spending it, then merchants would eventually stop bothering to accept it and gradually the value would decline.

If you use the Blockchain you pay a fee and that fee is necessarily paid in BTC.

I have done well over a dozen buy transactions with them, maybe double that, over the past year or so without any evidence of them screwing around with my money -- one transaction was cancelled but that seemed to have nothing to do with price movement after my order. I also moved out much of my holdings to my own address, again with no problems.
The answer to your question I think is that if they screw us over repeatedly, they will lose customers. It's nice that we have an instant way to complain and share with our fellow customers.
Also, except for the fact that my bank account has always been able to cover the cost of the BTC I purchased, I do not think there is anything very good about me as a customer --- if anything my credit rating I would guess is so bad that I would not even qualify as a customer.
I have never had emails go unreplied to for more than a day.
So I don't know why you are having a bad experience -- I hope it improves and I hope you will tell us about it because Coinbase is a crucial part of the ecosystem now.

Total market cap is around 3 billion, a decent-sized company and that value was achieved without an IPO or paying a CEO. It just sort of arose.
And that 3 billion is only already-mined coins.
It is subjective, but the price is not so low to me. I like the recent relative stability also.
@_date: 2015-02-01 07:24:35
Could another thing be:
The receiving address has to be prepared to accept the transaction from a particular address?
Your wallet will verify that the address is indeed the one you mean to send it to in this way.
Not all transactions have to work this way, but if both buyer and seller agree, there would be almost zero way you could accidentally send money to an address not prepared to accept from your address.
@_date: 2015-11-01 02:55:06
More important metric than number of transactions (which can be essentially faked/spammed) is total Bitcoin volume which is also growing.
@_date: 2015-02-16 06:07:36
I don't see no chart but I sure hope you are right. I have always believed BTC will be worth either pretty much nothing or a heck of a lot more than it is today.
Next year 10k? I would be thrilled but not amazed.
Periods of stability followed by sharp increases is the way I figure it but shake-outs of unreliable exchanges might interfere temporarily -- eventually these shady exchanges will all  be gone.
@_date: 2015-02-01 09:39:56
This price suppression achieved by selling at low prices but at very low volumes I don't think works.
I am seeing many extremely small trades, so low that if they were done on some exchanges the fees would be a large part of the total transaction, and what this achieves is an apparent decline in price. But volume has to be taken into account.

In this respect it is like "exercise and hold" of employee stock options -- you run a big risk of price dropping and still owing for amount at time of exercise or in this case mining. 
I would argue that in a thin market, the miner of BTC is in no way guaranteed to get "market price" (however that is derived) if she had chosen to sell.
@_date: 2015-02-01 10:38:39
Something like that but as I said to someone else, are we just trying to prevent someone from accidentally sending coins to the wrong address by typo? If so, the answer is, "Be careful."

Look, I understand what you are saying but the way people will think about BTC is what needs you can buy with it, like I can stay in a hotel for a night with 1 BTC, etc. We are not there yet but a lottery is a nice way to help move this kind of thinking forward; lotteries in and of themselves are of zero interest to me but one denominated solely in BTC would be a good thing for BTC.

I agree with posters about poker except try to convince *sites* to accept it. I went through the whole signup process with Bovada only to find out that BTC was not accepted (I guess this could have been looked up but I wasn't sure it would not be a discreet method quietly placed among other methods) -- they have called me a couple of times and each time I said I could not use their site without Bitcoin -- I asked to be off their "new customer" call list the second time.
You can try to become a developer but since poker is your thing, maybe being an evangelist among players (many of whom seem to know already about BTC but don't know why they should be involved) or as I said sites or even live casinos.
BTW, I know of a young man who left So Cal to play in Tia Juana. Not sure how he is doing but it sounded good for him at one point: living on the beach in a huge apartment, etc. I would guess poker has become progressively harder simply due to Darwinian principles.
@_date: 2015-02-26 19:38:27
It matters a lot but the OP's assertion seems to be that unless it is "high" or rising continuously, BTC will ultimately fail.
I on the other hand thing stability will increase adoption which will lead to gradual but still impressive increase in price. I don't need 10x in a year; 2x for the next 10 years is fine by me.

@_date: 2015-02-28 18:38:57
Have we already been seeing the results of relative stability?
I may be being both simplistic and biased, but I thought we would see periods of little movement followed by sharp increases in price (perhaps because the stability convinced people that BTC was "valuable").
Anyhow, so far I think we have sort of been seeing this. If this becomes a pattern, I would expect things to then change -- there will be speculation and less stability once it appears that that such a pattern really occurs.
I also firm believe that large players who wish to undermine BTC will attempt to fuck with the stability by massively short selling and possibly even by buy a lot to unpredictably increase prices. Once BTC use becomes more widespread, such players will have to spend a lot more to do this.

You are right: If the sole goal of say a consortium of large banks or even countries is to drive the price down, they can do so.

The extreme case of their being so scarce that it is not practical to use them was what I was thinking. I don't know enough about it.
But the main thing is, **scarcity could happen very easily.** Why it hasn't happened yet (of has it?) is there are not enough places to spend them/businesses that require them (I think there will be bizes that refuse fiat or situations where only BTC works and I can explain why) but there will be and also many have coins that cost them nothing.
Recent transaction volumes may indicate a large number of holders have bought at higher prices and such people may not be disposed towards selling.

It actually is not that crazy of an idea: Issue would be the effect the pulse had on the memory of the device but it could be restored later.

The great thing is that if I manage to get Hallmark or someone else to do it, we have a huge potential demand for Bitcoin from which all BTC holders would benefit -- at Xmas time, think how many potential coins would be needed if this caught on? I would imagine it could actually be a significant percentage of all outstanding BTC and they would be tied up from the time the cards are printed to the time the kid calls Grandma.
**And really, tell me how you would do this with a credit card or cash?** With cash I guess Grandma could cut a bill in half, but that is not what people do.
In general, shouldn't all gifting be more interactive than just shoving cash in an envelope?

As someone who knows tons of pro-players I would say that is a swell idea: Did you know that in the 1995 WSOP (I may have the year wrong but somewhere) there was not a single no-limit holdem ring game? There were potlimit games and of course events that were no-limit, but around that time, it looked like no-limit holdem had burnt itself out. Of course, online poker revitalized the game as did hole-card cameras.
But there is no reason to rule out completely that poker, through a Darwinian process, burns itself out again. The money ends up in the pockets of the best players and of course the casinos.
Also, if people do the analysis, I wonder how many would be convinced that they can in the long run beat not only the rake but also the expenses of traveling? I think online was a way better deal for the players.

As others have expressed, buy and hold and don't check every minute (like I do). The costs per trade are too high (as far as I have seen) for day trading.
But the fundamental theorem of Bitcoin imho is either it is worth nothing or a lot and the value per coin should go up with usage which is indisputably going up.
The rising and falling is I think due to speculation but eventually the speculation will be swamped by the value that comes from utility.

**But:** My big interest with the homeless is people understanding that it is most of the time a condition that stems from laziness.

I see plenty of articles in which the term is used. So even if re-reading the article yet again showed me why the term "From Address" should not be used, what I am seeking is a clear explanation, one that does not require multiple readings to understand.

If I understand the initial question, it seems like we are trying to solve the problem of mis-entering an address in the "send to" field in a wallet -- we are trying to prevent a typo, are we not?
So maybe we are suggesting an overly-complex solution when the correct solution is simple: "Be careful when entering the recipient's address."
Am I missing something?
@_date: 2015-02-20 03:47:46
I think maybe we don't tell how much -- part of the surprise like sometimes it is a full BTC and other times way less.
Biggest problem I see is people who have no intention of buying product -- but there may be ways around this (like looking at IP address to rule out people in countries where they could not buy the product) or maybe you risk some people game it and some are sincere.
@_date: 2015-02-22 01:08:30

I assume that many of these workers never see Bitcoin -- it is just a way of transmitting money.
But it seems to me that it could evolve: some local vendor of say a staple like rice ends up accepting Bitcoin directly and buying stuff in the USA with it.

Four points:
1. If there is actual volatility but the wallet "eliminates" this volatility, it does not do so for free 
2. The article indeed did say that the pot seller was concerned about volatility so volatility seems to be a factor (and reasonably so) for at least some pot sellers. 
3. This has been that flattest past 30 days I recall and this makes hedging much cheaper for pot merchants, whether they hedge by themselves or a pay fee to BitReserve. This boring flatline I think is very good news. Moreover, the entire year has been very stable.
4. What causes stability? It is hard to imagine a commodity which has a price based purely n speculation could exhibit such stability. I conclude that what we are seeing is an indication of intrinsic value, a value that one would expect to increase with user base growth.
@_date: 2015-02-15 02:42:31
That is 100% correct -- **I frigging love fiat!** But surely that doesn't mean that BTC has no role. It is highly functional -- you can do stuff with it that you can't with cash/credit cards.

it is that and exaggeration in the media thereof. if the value of the losses in BTC was compared to the losses in things like recent bank stuff, etc. and reported accordingly, it would not seem like such a big deal. 
@_date: 2015-02-11 16:02:33
Indeed, thinking of BTC addresses like email addresses is what I was doing but then I was told that this is not strictly speaking correct. There is, for example, an article which says that there is no "from" address and then others go on to say there are actually no addresses at all, only scripts. This would be literally impossible for a non-technical person to understand at all, even though it be true, apparently.
@_date: 2015-02-07 05:54:29

@_date: 2015-02-15 02:09:53
In a fiat bank saving account, essentially the same thing is happening but because of collateral there is in theory no risk.
So BTCJam offers high rates with high risk. As discussed already in the thread devoted to it, the absence of collateral is puzzling indeed.
So what kind of thing are you looking for? Would investing in a company that not only was Bitcoin centric but also wanted BTC investment be something you would consider?
@_date: 2015-02-20 04:51:18
My holdings are for MTO reason:
1. Investment
2. Savings: even without big price increase, I like the idea of having money someplace where only I can find it. I once had the idea in the late 1990s of buying many gold coins: the price was relatively low and I frankly love the look and feel of gold, especially pre-1933 USA 20 dollar gold pieces. But then I thought: Where do I put them? If anyone knew about horde of coins, I would be a target for burglary with only a weak door lock protecting them.
So I never did it. Now I got something that, assuming the math is correct, is a theoretically almost untouchable horde that I can go anywhere in the World or in another 20 years the Solar System and access. Try carrying 100 ounces of gold around. Imagine going through airport and now everyone in line knows you carrying them!
@_date: 2015-02-22 05:17:21
my thoughts exactly. that doesn't rule out deliberate attempts to interfere with the stability.
@_date: 2015-02-25 09:39:54
You mean how prices of other "investments" that turned out to ultimately be worthless behaved?
I know that in some cases, there were precipitous drops that were however followed by "hope-giving" rises; I think this happened with the USA stock exchange in 1929 and we know how that turned out.
However, the time scale was much briefer. Bitcoin has now had significant price per coin, even after the catastrophes that we have experienced, for two years. Recently there has been apparent stability.
As far as stability, this has real significance to merchants and potential merchants: I don't know where to look this up off the top of my head but if option premiums have dropped for BTC due to this stability, then it costs merchants less to hedge.
@_date: 2015-02-20 03:59:37
I don't understand what you mean by "posting an ad on the text of the bitcoin" -- can you elaborate?
@_date: 2015-02-01 10:12:09
I think I did not phrase my question well: If you purchase a hedge, such as an option, the cost of the option would be higher if historically the volatility of the underlying is higher.

I think it becoming illegal in the USA would face legal challenges based on the US Marshall Service being one of the largest *users* AND *holders* in the world.
When they confiscate drugs on the other hand, they just destroy them (in theory).
There is no compelling argument for making BTC illegal. It really is just a way to do transactions more efficiently -- the very name crypto currency has nothing to do with anonymity or secrecy but opponents either believe it does or are just lying.
@_date: 2015-02-26 18:59:42
In the long run, stability will be the best thing. Not rapid rises which can't be sustained.
Stability, that is, lack of volatility, means lower hedging costs ,which are costs that merchants incur to protect themselves

This would have to be done with the organizers of the show, not individual merchants since you are parasitizing their security arrangements. However, if any merchants already wanted to accept Bitcoin, then you could probably get away with doing low-key transactions for free there.
It seems so natural that I would not be surprised if this was already happening. **Last year when I went to the WSOP I thought around similar reasoning that Bitcoin would have an explicit presence among the many vendors but it did not; instead, when I needed cash I found two very obliging people who were quite willing to come by the hotel and give me cash for BTC (at market rate, basically).** 
I could tell just by looking at them that there would probably be no problem but I also benefited from the security guards there. There's a lot of cash of course at poker tournaments but very little theft although there is some -- **Greg Raymer was the victim of an attempted robbery several years ago but no one suggested that poker be banned.** (And Greg fought them off because although mild-mannered, he is is a big guy. Don't know what the punks were thinking beyond he probably had some cash but there are way easier-looking targets than him.)

The people who get rich from Bitcoin sure weathered a lot, even those who did not pay for them had to choose to hold one to them through the swings in price.

I am not sure what you are saying: If a person misses a digit, I don't know enough about addresses to know if that will tend to give another valid address or not.
If it does, then it is a typo but also dumb since with a little care or just cut and paste, that would not happen. So why do you need an extra tool when cut and paste would work?
Again, what am I missing? Is the OP not basically saying, how can entering the wrong address be rectified and the answer is, avoid entering the wrong address in the first place.

You have a unique or at least unusual POV for sure.
I am a developer and am struggling with ideas presented here and elsewhere online. One problem I have frankly with some explanations is I am not sure if in some cases the explainer is deliberately attempting to mislead or is just being a smartass or simply the idea is actually complex. A recent example of this is the idea that there is no from address and then it was presented that there are in fact no addresses only scripts.
There is no frigging way people (even developers not specifically experienced with Bitcoin) are going to be able to understand this kind of stuff especially because the term address is used throughout the documentation.

I am saying that if it really is a "hit man", trying to cause a price move "artificially", then probably the price will rise since, unlike the equities market with margin trading, such moves can really cause people who don't want to sell to do so or their broker will do it for them.
But if the price is genuinely too high, well then, the price is too high and will fall.

When I use a wallet, I need to enter the "to" address. When I look at that address on blockchain.info, I see the coins at that address and additionally I see the address from which I sent them, the "from" address.
If what you say is true, then blockchain.info does not help to clarify the situation at all, would you agree?
I am not sure if it semantics or what but if these two apparently contradictory explanations are presented (that is, what blockchain.info calls things and what you and the article say) do you think this will make prospective users scratch their heads before using Bitcoin or even not choose to try Bitcoin out at all?

I hope it is possible to make good decisions about investing -- I have not had much luck.
But as far as sentiment, two thoughts:
1. The mainstream press has seemed anything but positive usually about BTC
2. Some of what we read I am convinced is not objective reporting but rather comes from people who want crypto currencies to fail
And here's a question:
What sort of signs/news do you think will indicate beforehand that a big rise is going to happen? (As I mentioned, job openings seems like a pretty important metric although when the numbers are low as they are today, it is not statistically significant; on the other hand, if Bitcoin jobs start show the same number of hits as do some other technologies like say, AWS or something, that will mean an awful lot I am convinced.)

But there is competition between transactions you want approved by miners, is there not? By attaching the smallest possible payment you guarantee you will be one of the last to be proceed.

I think the real demand will simply come from businesses needing them. Already remittances are becoming more popular and there are plenty of ideas that will require the company to acquire and keep on hand many Bitcoin.
In the long run, big Bitcoin prices will come only if Bitcoin has real value which I think it does: The use to remunerate customers for visiting a company's website seems like a case where only BTC (or some other crypto) can be used and I would be amazed if this specific usage doesn't happen. (Unless I am missing something fundamental.)

I think we are saying the same thing: a very modest number of humans could easily control all the coins in the world. At the current price, there are several people who could easily own them all. Of course the value comes not from this (hording by a few) but from their usage.

Are you disagreeing with me or agreeing?
It is not a moral issue, is it? All I am saying is that VCs believe that enough people are interested in BTC (to make money, for sure) to shove in .1 billion dollars.
These are not self-deluded Reddit readers -- these are almost certainly very bright guys who did and paid for a lot of research to determine whether Bitcoin is a pipe dream or a "real thing."
@_date: 2015-02-20 05:27:04
I don't think what you suggest can be easily done. How do you think you can distinguish bubbles from a "valid" price?
I look for things like: Transaction volume, evidence of increasing usage and also I have been checking job openings when I do searches using "Bitcoin" -- all of these things seem very positive.
Also, as far as I know, the current price is either lower than what miners make per coin or at least not very much above so if you can, without investing in a rig or paying for power, get coins anywhere near their costs, you are doing good.
But just looking at charts: I don't think that will tell you anything. Except: Maybe long periods of stability followed by modest rises might indicate a more robust price than one that came from a steep rise.

Paradoxically (if that is the right term) the very fact that fiat collects interest is part of the reason that new fiat gets printed and there inflates in value. So in a sense, you collect interest on your BTC just by their appreciation vs the dollar. (or your nation's currency

Thanks for your careful reply.
I feel the biggest problem we face is PR and for people who know already how to use Bitcoin just how hard things like email and browser used to be for people -- we have a long way to go with Bitcoin before it becomes easy enough for many even fairly technical people.
Moreover, we face people deliberately spreading misinformation which was not the case for the aforementioned apps.
I think we need a really simple wallet that above all makes it almost impossible for people to lose BTC; at this stage, I don't think Electrum is easy enough to use.

I am not sure how a more complex form of company with decision-makers would work, but I think this could be extended to handle that kind of company, too.
I would like to see some governance that would allow shareholders more of a voice in running companies -- or at least some way of preventing CEOs granting themselves (with the connivance of the board whom they often appointed) huge crazy bonuses and other abuses that seem to happen despite SEC regulation.
It would be naive to think that every decision could be voted on by shareholders but definitely shareholders should have more direct control than they do now.

**I purchased on the idea that I could buy for less than miners.** I can't get a clear answer on what it does cost miners. There is the power cost and then the cost of rigs. It might be extremely significant if the current price makes getting into the mining game unprofitable whereas those who already own rigs still make money by mining since the cost of power per coin is still less than current price.
I also see no reason for recent buyers to be in a hurry to sell. I think there will be stability followed by modest rises for a while. The stability will encourage vendors who accept BTC to retain more of it.

Many years ago, it was argued that it was very important to stop prostitution and gambling, two victim-less or at least consensual crimes, because the mob used the profits from these to fund crimes like drug dealing.
The idea being that the mob was not so much interested in criminal activities with the highest financial return but that they were interested in funding the less-profitable crimes like selling heroin with the proceeds from gambling because somehow the mob was compelled to sell heroin. 
I am not sure of the details (which crimes were used to fund which other crimes) but the above absurd argument was essentially put forth.

Given that currency conversion is a non-trivial expense, I expect this to be considered.
There will be some Filipinos who will become enthused about Bitcoin; the very fact that they are sending remittance indicates that they are overseas and to me that implies more adventurous. 
The fact that all the natives (in this thread) sound so pessimistic indicates a business opportunity exists -- many obvious ideas that would just come from emulating businesses that already exist in other countries and maybe take advantage of more lax regulation in the Philippines (if indeed regulation is more lax).

My question assumed that change comes from the **receiver**: you send him too much and he has to send change back to you but that is false. The sender sends part of the BTC to the receiver **and the sender** sends the remainder to  another address or even to the original address.

One thing that you touched on without making it explicit: Bitcoin is the closest thing to the simplicity of a cash exchange without having to be physically in the same location.

bear in mind that even the worst criminal motivated by self-interest will avoid doing things that would make the price drop a lot if he steals a bunch of BTC. this doesn't cover all scenarios but it does cover many scenarios that could adversely affect BTC price. For example, a big theft the criminal would sell carefully, maybe even help the people he stole from to keep it quiet, maybe even return some of the coins if that is what it required to avoid news articles that would make people dump their BTC.

I could see a reliable reputation system which takes into account size of transactions and most importantly the reputation itself becomes valuable and, hear me out, **a commodity that itself may be sold.**
Would the idea of reputation being something that can be traded to someone else work?

Your point about cash recycling makes sense but a machine that only took debit/credit cards and BTC avoids that problem.
I think it could be argued that the machine is not holding anyone's funds if as soon as the BTC/fiat is input the customer gets back the opposite. So a real escrow machine would be problematic but an ATM that happens to sometimes use funds that came from other customers does not seem to me to have that problem.
@_date: 2015-02-04 23:03:09

If you have a business that is not tolerant of the volatility (I say business because I want an example where the parties involved really calculate costs) and so hedges, the business has to take into account the cost of the hedge as it affects its profits.
I would like to see how this hedging works in detail, in particular, if you have one Bitcoin and you want to guarantee (in effect) that the price remains above 200 for the next month, you can do this by buying a put. If that put costs 10 bucks, I would guess there goes a big percentage of the profit.
I would guess successful retailers who accept Bitcoin will be willing to accept the swings OR make arrangements with one of their suppliers to pay for things for a set amount of Bitcoin (an amount that does not change with the exchange rate). Alternatively, convince some employees to accept bonuses (for example) in BTC (again one that is fixed, not affected by fluctuations).

Maybe part of the problem in classifying Bitcoin is that it is a new sort of thing. Anyway, some of the terms you list have huge overlap, etc. 
Certainly all of the above can be property.
Cash is a physical thing, I think. Or at least a one time that is what it meant, as opposed to a promissory note -- but as cash stopped representing gold the difference between notes and cash faded.
Or I might be talking out of my ass. Why is it necessary to understand the meaning of each of the above term to understand Bitcoin?

Well, in a conventional bank, there is no real "account" -- there is no physical slot where money is put corresponding to your account, the account is only a key in places in memory where if you find this key you will also find the numbers corresponding to balances.
So there are all sorts of abstractions in software that are perfectly valid ways to think about things in that they are useful and understandable.
So what I am trying to understand about the article is when he says there is no "from" address, does he mean, if you think there is one and you therefore try to send BTC to that "from" address, it might turn out the the human being can no longer access that "from" address in order to get the BTC out of it? Or is he seeing something deeper.
And when you say there is no "to" address, just what would you call the thing I eagerly check after I send BTC to from my online wallet so that I can have complete control of my Bitcoins?

I think it does, too; and it is hard for me to imagine that if it has value, that somehow we have found its ultimate price.
If the value is a linear function of usage (which is probably too simple but maybe not too far off) then it is not hard to imagine BTC being used (in terms of number of transactions/day) 20 or even 100 times more than it currently is used and even those number may be pretty conservative.
Here is an example of increase that no one would have guessed: World Series of Poker in the 1990s was getting way below 1k players -- I was there one year when 160 showed up and every year was a record due to a pattern of steady and decent percentage increases -- people were pretty happy about a million+ prize pool.
Who would have guessed they would be turning away players, eventually accommodating more than 8k players? Especially because online was thought to compete with, not complement, live poker?
I have heard the huge number attributed to both online poker and what might seem like a fairly modest development, the hole card cameras that made many home viewers think that they were geniuses.
So my point is, sometimes huge changes can occur very fast and sometimes it is seemingly small details that have big effects.
So 50 to 1 from current price? WSOP did things like that and it was no fluke because the numbers have remained high.

Why tie BTC tickets to dollar? That on principle is a reason that I would refuse to play. (If I played lotteries.)
It also could only increase regulatory scrutiny. Just choose a reasonable price, .01 BTC or something.

What is it this hypothetical "Economic Hit Man" doing that you object to?
If you were buying a house to live in and someone was doing something to lower the price, he would be performing a great service to you, essentially subsidizing the purchase of your house.
If the price of BTC belongs higher legitimately, no hit man is going to be able to keep the price down forever. I currently want coins so it is great.
Of course someday I hope the price recovers and if the only reason it is down is because of an artificial attempt to drive it down, the recovery will happen.
On the other hand, and this is why the behavior of hit men (if they do exist) is not completely irrational, if by pounding on the price they can  undermine faith in BTC, then they will have accomplished what they want.
But they are not even close. Even at 1 dollar per coin, it still has utility. At 200+, it is of course much more useful.

I am not convinced that people were against abolition for religious reasons; I think they used religion to justify slavery but few honestly put forth the argument essentially, "Because there was slavery in the bible we *must* enslave people."
Frankly, guys like Jeff Davis were grasping at straws when they turned to the bible for this; they also said that they were doing Africans a favor by civilizing them (like there were no civilizations in Africa) -- slavery was an intermediate step. It makes one angry to learn about such bullshit.
BTW, William Lloyd Garrison, an extreme abolitionist (I think not only was he against slavery but he was for full equality, a rare stance in the 19th century even among abolitionists -- Lincoln believed in "repatriation" I am pretty sure.) was an pretty big anti-Semite for religious reasons, also. He discussed "Christ killing Jews", etc.

You pay taxes on profits, not gross amount of BTC. You subtract all mining costs including equipment and power.

You are concerned that they will not pay off in case of a big swing in price?
If so and your concern is shared by merchants than maybe the ETF will make a big difference in adoption.
Personally, if I had a company, I would not hedge. It is not free and in the long run the hedging companies do worse therefore than those that do not.
My understanding of historical usage of futures was not hedging but in fact a way to raise cash against a future crop. (I could be wrong.) There is a distinction -- you had farmer, not sophisticated traders but just serious creators of commodities who needed money. But even they got screwed if the crop failed and maybe this was the origin of the options market as a separate thing from futures. (I could be wrong yet again.)
EDIT: I read the Wiki article on Futures and it is more complex than I here stated, requiring margin which makes sense otherwise anyone could just say, sure I will give you all this corn in a few months if you give me money now.
There is no "give me money now" part; it is just that the farmer is given a guarantee of a price for his product in advance but not cash in advance. Maybe there *is* however a way to do this somehow.

@_date: 2015-02-01 09:42:32
But you could have a wallet that checks if the address being sent to has been informed that coins from a particular address are expected.
This probably would require a change to Bitcoin itself, however. And if so, the wallet wouldn't check; it would potentially be part of the protocol.
Not every transaction would work this way but if you wanted to receive BTC from an address that wanted this kind of transaction, then your address would have to be prepared for transactions from that address.

I can understanding following Bitcoin on Reddit so assiduously only if one has a financial stake: Long/Short or paid to bash; I don't know who would be paying pro-BTC shills since there are already plenty who "work for free." What people always question is why, say, Western Union would pay a shill? I think if they pay to advertise on TV they would do the equivalent on Reddit. I am sure it is not much money and it can't simply be multiple posts with no interaction -- if they do indeed pay shills, they almost certainly pay them for *interactions*.

I don't think you can say that it will not succeed or will succeed (although certainly by some measures it has succeeded already: 
"We'll always have Paris..." (Casablanca)
But there are things that can be done that will completely stop its use in the United States virtually overnight -- just like what happened to online poker which was thriving and fun and basically harmless.
There are many examples of laws that must have amazed people when they were passed and enforced: Prohibition, outlawing heroin (once could get it from Sears catalog), etc.
Bottom line, if the government wants to stop it, it can easily do so.
On the other hand, if governments do support it, even one government anywhere (like say Cyprus decides to make it the national form of currency) there is enough evidence already to show that it will become even more successful since it does seem to have not just people's interest but definite utility.

@_date: 2013-12-14 21:05:27
I know this is a specific company but perhaps you can answer a general set of questions about accepting BTC.
1. Will top priority be to convert BTC into local currency or does Atilus intend to keep BTC?
2. If the latter, will it pay employees in BTC (at least sometimes)? What about Atilus's suppliers -- are they attempting to convince at least some of them to accept BTC?
3. Again, if Atilus decides to retain BTC, how will they deal with taxes?
4. If the former and Atilus decides to convert BTC, what real advantage do they derive, other than possibly increasing their customer base? Is this more of a strategic move, looking forward to the day when more suppliers (for example) will accept BTC?
@_date: 2013-12-16 20:27:20
Further thoughts:
The US did stop poker in US but it continued elsewhere.
So if online poker turns out to be a precedent, expect something like BTC end up being successful in other countries which of course would mean that BTC will continue to be valuable and perhaps increase significantly in value.
Maybe countries that embrace it will become more successful economically because of it; maybe Cyprus will end up be a international financial powerhouse (the university there accepting BTC and plans to have many businesses around it accept BTC might be the start of something huge...)
@_date: 2015-02-04 22:23:26
What is 13 bits per dollar?
I think I agree with the spirit of your post in that how is something valued if you knew that someone would pay exactly its mining cost in the future and you knew what that cost is? Except it seems like it should not be less than what you know someone will pay for it -- it could be substantially more.
Also, if miners can't create sufficient quantity to keep up with demand, then the price could be much higher than their costs unless greater demand causes cost to rise due to competition.

Some of what he is glibly saying does not hold up to scrutiny. One simple example: you go to a Safeway and offer the cashier a BTC for a bunch of bottled water: "If he's smart, he'll take it!"
Really, the cashier would have to have enough money on him to buy the water himself and give it to you. He would also have to have the means to verify the BTC, etc.
Basically, it would not happen if the checker valued his job, since the line would not be moving during this lengthy transaction.
The water bottles thing is just something simple that I am in a position to evaluate; he also made more complex statements that may or may not be true but I know what my bias towards such statements by him is now.
Lee strikes me as somewhat of a showman, somewhat disingenuous and someone basically interested in making money off of BTC -- I would therefore take what he says with a grain of salt.

That is what I said, determining what goes and what doesn't (and definitions thereof) are the hard part.
But if you accept, as libertarians do, the need for some laws, then BTC not facilitating violations of these laws I would guess you would agree with. And perhaps you would agree that, if it can be implemented, it is an advantage of BTC (over dollars) that law enforcement might like.
Importantly, the Code of Conduct I envision is not influenced by local laws; it is a much more liberal set of rules that only allows intervention in transactions for the most severe criminal behavior.
And, this BTC CoC would be so liberal that sometimes it would even facilitate some crimes that the community is against -- perhaps it could not be used to assist in criminal prosecution, no matter how heinous the crime, but only after, to the satisfaction of some BTC community "court", the guilt had been proven.
Anyway, maybe it can or can't be implemented due to technical issues; even if it can be, there is a tremendous amount of work to be done to develop the very rigorous set of rules under which the CoC affects usage of BTC. (Literally years of work, perhaps.)
Edit: Who decides is obviously also a huge question.

Are you saying that rather than doing this:
Create an address and private key outside of Electrum into which I sent BTC from my online wallet, I should have sent the BTC from the online wallet directly into an address that Electrum automatically (is this true?) created?
I see in Electrum a Receive tab and under that a Main account "subfolder" under which are Receiving and Change. Did Electrum create the several addresses for me? If so, can I ask for more to be created?
Also, those addresses has I assume private keys that I do not have to import -- I can spend from that wallet using those addresses without being prompted for private key?
I did notice that after I imported a private key, what I saw under imported was not the key but the address derived from that key.

Natural price stability (as opposed to stability achieved by market manipulation) makes merchants who accept Bitcoin less anxious to unload the BTC immediately (in case the value drops) or in a more common situation, those merchants who hedge by buying puts, etc. are spending less for hedging when the price of BTC is less volatile.

I know people who bring up pedophilia every time I mention BTC. It would be great if it weren't associated *further* with criminal activities (since it already has been).
In fact, there would be nothing wrong with making it impossible, in a limited set of circumstances, to get away with stuff like this using BTC. A BTC code of conduct, enforced in some way. Determining what that code would be would of course be very difficult to agree upon -- extortion seems however to be fairly easy to imagine people would accept as off-limits behavior.

Maybe FBI is too small an aspect of the big picture to have an effect on whether they will avoid outlawing BTC -- but once FBI does sell, I feel that legislating against Bitcoin will look pretty bad.
And maybe the gov does care about the money -- maybe they will want the value to go up, a lot: at a million a coin, the FBI ends up doing really well. (Do they issue xmas bonuses? I bet they do, just not officially...)

Like the first poster said, ask a professional if you are concerned.
But the answer seems pretty obvious: you made 500 in profit; the other coins' appreciation is not taxable, anymore than you would pay taxes on a stock that rose but you did not sell.
The only complexity is, when you purchase something with an appreciated asset (without first liquidating) then what? But this is also simple: yes, you owe taxes?

And telling them anything will make it happen immediately.
Again with online poker: I got calls from Western Union who was mediating money transfer by letting me send money to the Philippines to fund my Fulltilt account. I told them whatever, basically it was none of their business why I was sending money to "a friend" in Manilla -- they stopped accepting transfers.
They can't do it fast but they will figure it out. If you have to use a backdoor method, it will end up costing you in fees, etc. (Like I had to wait around for a clerk at the store that had a WU kiosk for maybe an hour sometimes and of course pay the WU fees -- it used to be a simple online transaction. How I hate people telling me what I can and can't do with my money...)

This was perhaps then another compelling reason for a government being the issuer; now this reason has gone away.
There just doesn't seem to be a good reason (to me) why peer-to-peer fundamentally won't work. And then without the middleman (the government who gets its substantial cut) the value of the currency is simply greater.

Okay, what I am saying is, there have been recent articles about Cryptolocker extorting BTC. Not dollars but BTC. This is bad for BTC and as mentioned, will be used probably as a pretext by those opposed to BTC to help outlaw BTC's use.
However, it seems possible, since people have discussed blacklisting (the details of which I am unfamiliar with), that perhaps BTC could have a feature that in extremely limited circumstances could be used to help prevent such criminal activity.
If true, then a major objection to BTC would be eliminated and in fact it could be argued that this makes BTC a superior form of payment to those sincerely opposed to BTC because of criminal usage of them -- superior over dollars which of course now *dominate* criminal transactions.
That's my last word on this.

Not sure I saw this asked or answered explicitly.
At what point should a company, which you say should avoid converting to fiat, sell to pay taxes?
Should you convert 35% immediately to fiat? Is there a way to hedge so you don't have to sell or does the IRS expect taxes paid at the price BTC were when the transaction happened or only when you convert?

Eventually the price will be subject to supply/demand (from usage) not speculation, more like real currency. Perhaps paradoxically the stabilization is the signal that this is beginning, the paradox being that this perception will then cause a rapid rise.
@_date: 2013-12-23 10:03:33
Yes, people who need to use it: African school kids buying online classes, etc. will continue to buy it. 
It seems unlikely that prices will ever completely stabilize: if the value is dependent upon an ever-increasing adoption, even if people accept that BTC is intrinsically valuable it should still fluctuate. Not go straight up but bounce around due to people both buying for use and speculation.
I don't think any commodity is free from speculation. In the past, I don't think an example of something even close to BTC has existed, with a predefined scarcity and production rate.

After finishing the book I would like to add my thoughts:
1. The book has something to say about the way people used to think about money. (Just think how things would work today if a requirement of coins was that they actually contained their value in gold or silver -- I am guessing this would not be possible to do.)
2. The position Newton got was previously treated as a sinecure but Newton took it seriously and did an outstanding job. Consider bringing this up if you are a candidate (or you are interviewing one) and someone brings up the objection of overqualification -- I never believed this was valid and perhaps Newton's performance at the mint is excellent proof of this invalidity.

When I read about its history, it turns out to have fairly humble beginnings -- no Wall Street quants involved when farmers wanted a guaranteed price for corn and were willing to give up part of their (potential) profits to do so.
Seems to me the volatility issue is solved for merchants if they simply sell their BTC for cash just as soon as they complete transactions but services already exist for this.
But even as I write this, the following opportunity occurs to me: some merchants might want some of the potential gains: if they immediately get out of the BTC into dollars, they might regret missing the run up. So perhaps you could sell them a product that guarantees them cash AND part of the run up (maybe only in extreme cases or something).

I hope it works out for you.
But the following real thing happened:
Years ago I put a significant amount in an obscure stock that one day, after hours made a trivial (in retrospect) announcement and the price tripled in after hours trading. Chance of a lifetime but I screwed it up and in part I have to attribute it to the flood of silly suggestions instead of rapidly calling my accountant for tax advice that would have resulted in my liquidating (since I would have gotten capital gains treatment that I didn't know the details of then) and being at least comfortable to this very day.
One guy said, "Don't sell, you know it's going to go to 100!"
"Yeah?" replied I, "Do you know what they do?"
"No..." was his clever answer.
It still rankles. My fault for listening but like I said, it was very distracting.

The ridicule I was reacting to was from the other replier.
What I meant to say was, when I originally read about BTC, I knew it only as a way to purchase on SR -- I did not know then that it had usage independent of SR.
So here is my question: Did SR vendors have a reasonable expectation 2+ years ago that they could get cash easily for BTC? And if so, was it via Coinbase-like services or something that SR offered? (Like the cage at a casino.)
@_date: 2013-12-19 12:14:31
I should say, for some people, it does not work. In some circumstances. You really need to have hung out at big poker tournaments to understand completely.
Also, people are coming from different countries.
In the specific case of winning a bunch of cash in a side game that you don't want to carry around with you, say more than ten thousand. Also, you are from a different country without a bank branch in Vegas.
BTC seems compelling in this sort of situation.
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:24:01

@_date: 2013-12-15 05:34:35
Good answer except I am not convinced about the conversion costs in practice since when I purchase a BTC from Coinbase I definitely pay not just a fee to them of about 1 percent but also some amount more than I could immediately sell it back for. (bid/ask spread.)
The charge back fraud may be where BTC is sufficiently helpful to offset the bid/ask spread -- I don't know enough about it.
If you can give an illustrative example, comparing the same transaction with credit cards and BTC, from start to finish, including necessary conversion for tax purposes, I would like to see it as others would, I am sure.
I would really like to see this work out and although the following may sound like BS, it is not: I am working for a large company that I would be happy to help to try convince of accepting BTC for payment if I believed more strongly in it myself -- already I own a handful of BTC personally.

@_date: 2013-12-21 07:12:00
They will need to keep some for refunds. This will perhaps make them more comfortable about keeping them around.
They will also try to encourage their many suppliers to accept BTC.
Because of their large number of suppliers, this will be a very good thing for BTC -- almost too good to be true and I will believe it when Overstock actually does it.
@_date: 2013-12-15 23:09:41
It sounds like you would prefer the G-Men could not sell the coins.
If so, I would point out that, afaik, the former holder of the coins tried to hire someone to kill someone.
(My strong opinion on this is, if you legitimately have a reason for someone else to die, you need to do it yourself for both moral and practical reasons -- never, never hire someone: they can hold it over your head forever and by definition they are very dangerous people.)

Thanks for your reply.
The tax thing is subtle (and frightening). Bear in mind, not that this is directly applicable, how the IRS handles stock option exercises as just an example of how complex and sometimes counter-intuitive taxation can be. (What I was thinking of was people who exercised and held only for the share price to drop -- they owed on the price at the time of the exercise and, just perhaps, this will be how the Feds choose to deal with BTC...) 
I have no credentials in tax law, but if the above turns out to be true, you can't wait very long to discuss with your accountant. And maybe get a second opinion.
@_date: 2013-12-16 20:00:30

@_date: 2013-12-21 07:27:07
I think the refund thing because it is almost certain that they will need a consistent policy to refund in kind.
There is friction associated with conversion, so even though conservatively they want to convert to fiat, if they can avoid exposure not be converting but by passing them on to suppliers, they will.
@_date: 2013-12-02 01:04:16
Anyway, good way to remember correct spelling is that "abated" and "bated" are related words. (Maybe bated is an older form..)

When I first heard about it 2-3 years ago, I had no idea it was like a currency but instead just something to be used on Silk Road.
I guessed there was an agreement to convert back and forth between BTC and dollars only to facilitate trading on SR -- I did not imagine there was any sort of fluctuation in value.
I think I was planning on buying some but saw no easy way at the time to do so -- maybe one bank offered it but there were some hoops to jump through... too bad, as others observed but there is no good reason to think I would have held onto any.

I am not asking for advice but given that perhaps you have knowledge of what USA companies are doing in this regard, I would be extremely interested in an example.
What is the advantage that my company would have in accepting BTC, given that the transaction fee savings would be more than offset by the currency conversion costs (from BTC to dollars) that are necessary for both taxes and paying employees and suppliers?
Without an answer to the above, it doesn't seem worth considering.

@_date: 2013-12-19 12:32:11
I think to an extent, you are right.
However, as time goes on, it will become clear that a portion of the BTC should be retained. For example, for refunds which one poster got into a dispute with over when he chose to refund in BTC which miffed the buyer after the decline.
Perhaps as suppliers also accept BTC more income will be retained in BTC form.

Do their creditors suggest things that imply they should or should not use BTC??
@_date: 2013-12-17 22:59:37
Why wouldn't Coinbase, for example, post a detailed guide for retailers? (Perhaps they have -- I can't find it.)
If they haven't, are they concerned about legal liability? If they are worried about liability, think how worried a small business without legal resources would be.
I would say, without clear instructions, most small businesses will just wait for such information. Perhaps same goes for bigger businesses...

Importantly, Western Union is damn nosy. After sending money to a foreign country for online poker account funding, I received a phone call from WU and when I was asked who the person was, I said a friend. Of course they had a pretty good idea of what I was doing and I don't remember why I could manage to convince them it was just friends who needed money but it ended up that they did not let me use WU anymore.
They were expensive and time consuming for funding poker, anyhow.
They were of course obligated by law to inquire but don't they allow tax evasion anyhow? They seemed over-zealous about poker.
I hope BTC kicks their ass.

You fail to address at all the refund point. An actual seller had the problem of refunding in BTC and the buyer complaining because (of course) BTC had dropped recently.
So obviously the seller needed a policy to be posted regarding refunds. What policy do you think it would be? Refund always in dollars (irrespective of payment type), always in BTC (even if paid in dollars??) or always in the original currency?
Seems to me that only the third makes any sense. If you fail to respond to this, who is full of it? (Like I would let my judgement be clouded by a couple weeks in salary of BTC.)

I did not mean it as a history -- I was asking. I had only looked in a cursory fashion at SR, knew nothing about BTC beyond it being the way you bought stuff there.
I did think that conversion was guaranteed at anytime except perhaps it was offered as a service to SR vendors.

It is so easy to be ridiculed here -- I think if you will reread the original post, you will see it was a reasonable question.

Irrespective of his indication that they will convert to USD, I think they will keep some BTC for refunds. Moreover, since the conversion has some overhead, I bet they will encourage suppliers (of which they have many) to accept BTC.
It is a very good thing if it happens and it will, again because of the number of suppliers, indeed be a good thing for the BTC ecosystem.

The hedging will become less and less necessary as suppliers agree also to accept BTC. 
While stability in price of BTC would also make hedging less important, suppliers accepting BTC would work without stability. However, I think that a side effect of greater acceptance of BTC will reduce instability.
