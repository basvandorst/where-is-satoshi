I go to Morocco every 2 years I've stayed in shithole farms and luxury villas and there is infact  christians in Morocco. Certain parts of Morocco are more liberal for example tangier you can go in a mini skirt and go buy alchohol and go clubbing. It just depends on the area. And Sidi Kacem if you wore a mini skirt you would get a lot of strange looks. Also I never heard of stoning A in Morocco
