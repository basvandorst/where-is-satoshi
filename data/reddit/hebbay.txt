You can't be serious, you never heard of regulatory capture?  So you think its also good for government and unelected agencies to make laws without needing congress to pass the laws?  Maybe you should move to North Korea if you hate America and the constitution, and you love dictatorships.

Yeah you are a piece of trash.  Your only defense is to use ad hominem insults.  Its always the freedom lovers who are the loudest, because we have justice and truth on our side.  You boot lickers will always lose in the end.  Enjoy being a slave. You and your family will suffer dearly under this tryanny, you piece of filth.  Libertarians and Ron Paul have been proven right on every issue, yet you morons still can't understand anything.  You are seriously either brain dead with below 100 IQ, or work as a shill for the state.

There are already antitrust laws on the books for monoplies that try to wreck the internet.  The free market solves issues.  Learn about regulatory capture and you will understand why this is going to lead to more monopolies and problems than a free market system.

So you trusting the corrupt politicians, and Obama and Hillary Clinton who are pushing this "Net Neurtrality" bill to keep it free?  Its a trick to bring in regulation over the internet.  Right now its free, and no real regulation on ISPs, but this bill will change that.  Not sure why people got brainwashed thinking regulation to enforce net neurtrality is somehow a good idea.  Reminds of the people who thought the Afordable Care Act would provide Affordable Care.
@_date: 2015-02-26 21:07:49
Do you still think this bill is going to be good, when the 322 page bill is secret and we are not allowed to see it?  Source: 
Remember legislation usually does the opposite of what they say.
@_date: 2015-02-27 18:32:04
LOL, so you teach at a public university shilling for the state for a living.  What a pathetic piece of trash you are.  Learn about regulatory capture then idiot, and how the monopolies will capture regulators to protect their monopolies.  Really is America this fucking stupid??  You disgust me.
@_date: 2015-02-26 15:43:32
We already have anti-trust laws setup for the case of monopolies trying to wreck the internet.  Net Neutrality bill is a trojan horse and does the opposite of what it says(from parts that have leaked), same as Affordable Care Act, Patriot Act, etc...
@_date: 2015-02-27 14:42:42
Please learn about capitalism and free markets, the foundation of what America used to be.  It is what gave us prosperity.  Its why we were known as Land of the Free. Government does not solve problems, people solve problems in a free market. You are the one that is the troll.

Ron Paul also spoke out against the FCC internet takeover: 
@_date: 2015-02-27 13:07:13
You seem like a boot licker.
@_date: 2015-02-26 14:10:18
The 322 page bill for Net Neutrality is secret and you can't see it until it is passed into law.
Edit:  This is very relevant to Bitcoin, if they can censor the internet, they can censor Bitcoin websites, etc...
Edit2: Here is another video starting at 4min that talks more about the issue: 
Edit3: Another newscast on the issue: 
@_date: 2015-02-27 14:19:55
Free markets solve issues, not governments.  Also there are already antitrust laws on the books to stop any monopolies from destroying the internet, wake up.  Are you glad that they passed the law without needing congress to pass it too? Do you like dictatorships?  Now they can make rules to ban anything they want, just give this new FCC power some time to simmer.
@_date: 2015-02-27 14:39:26
Its still secret as far as I know.  They wouldn't let anybody see it before they "passed" it, meaning the unelected FCC just voted on it themselves.  This is no law passed by congress, which makes it unconstitutional.  I saw something that they might release the text of it in 30 days.  They want to wait til it simmers, and the zombies claim victory.  Then they can come out with the real thing later and it will be old news, so the outrage will be reduced against it.
@_date: 2015-02-26 21:05:57
This is a trojan horse, the 322 page bill is secret, thread about it here: 
@_date: 2015-02-27 14:14:42
People are really zombies to fall for this.  And the Patriot Act was Patriotic, the Affordable Care Act gave us Affordable Care.  You can't be seriously this naive.  You will find out the hard way when they start to use the FCC power to censor websites.
@_date: 2015-02-27 13:08:44
There is some other propaganda that the FCC having power to censor the internet is "freedom" and "net neutrality" also.  Wake the fuck up idiots.
@_date: 2015-02-27 13:52:34
This proves that America is now a dictatorship.  No law by congress was needed.  The government just enacts any rules it wants to takeover the internet or do anything else it likes.
@_date: 2015-02-27 13:05:46
The Net Neutrality FCC thing was a trojan horse to have the FCC censoring the internet.  The 322 page rules are secret.  Thread about it here: 
@_date: 2015-02-27 14:11:19
Wow, real propaganda here, I wonder who you work for.  Always active within minutes on this topic...amazing, your boss must be proud.
@_date: 2015-02-27 15:04:40
LOL, and why isn't it publicly available? What are they hiding??  Are we all really this naive?  They think we are idiots, and they may be right.
@_date: 2015-02-26 15:45:58
They will write the bill with very ambiguous language, so it may not seem so bad at first.  But later they will use the wording of the bill to usurp more power and control in censoring the internet.  The solution is mesh networks and more decentralization in the internet, of which Bitcoin can help providing incentives to get mesh networks scaled.

Ohh when you are taking on flack, it means you're over the target, upvoted ;)
@_date: 2015-02-26 15:53:41
Well conspiracy theorist is just a throwaway ad hominem.  Alex Jones predicted a lot of the tyranny we see today years before it happened.  For example the NSA Snowden stuff, ObamaCare, Patriot Act, destroying the constitution, Fast and Furious Scandal, government funding and creating of Al Qaeda.  He has been proven right on many fronts.
@_date: 2015-02-27 13:55:17
LOL, you statist shill.
@_date: 2015-02-27 13:05:31
So the 322 page FCC ruling is not secret then?  I gotcha
@_date: 2015-02-27 13:59:36
The state paid trolls/shills are out in force with their downvote armies.  They don't want the truth to get out.  You all will find out the hard way, morons.
@_date: 2015-02-26 16:27:38
@_date: 2015-02-27 14:28:10
How can you know that when the text of the net neutrality bill is still secret?????
@_date: 2015-02-26 15:50:26
Exactly, regulatory capture is what people need to understand.  If you don't know what it means, then look it up.  Also check Patrick Byrnes speech on regualtory capture: 
@_date: 2015-02-26 15:41:53


Didn't you know that ObamaCare was also a secret bill that passed before anybody could read it?  
So seems American zombies don't have a very good track record of resisting tyranny.
@_date: 2015-02-27 18:43:10
Well I am for following the constitution and the rule of law.  People who violate the constitution and using their voice to support treason are supporting tyranny.  At least people know North Korea is a tyranny, so its good to use that for their child-like minds to understand.  But you are the pathetic treasonous piece of trash that is the reason our country is failing.  You anti-capitalist filth should move to a communist country like North Korea if you don't like the principles America was built upon, you scumbag.
