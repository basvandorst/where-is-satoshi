I'm not competing, I want to have the most for my buck. Strategy is just a term that I used because of the game theory aspect of deciding if you pay with a credit card or not.

What's the use of this? To make it easier to purchase bitcoin? It's like an ETF to track the US dollar... just fucking keep your US dollars in a bank and it'll do the same freaking thing.

The thing is most alt coins aren't responding to any need. They are just out there so that the maker can make money out of it.
Bitcoin, Litecoin, Dogecoin... those cryptos didn't come out as a scam so that the owners could make money. The minute you start pre-mining your crypto, you are basically telling everybody that you aren't in for technical or ideological reasons, but because you want to make money.

Started mining 2 days ago and I still do. I plan to give all my dogecoins in tips once I get 200 DOGE (yes my GPU is pretty bad...).
Got interested in DOGE not because I just discovered cryptos, I actually was on /g/ threads all of last year since Jan 2013 lurking at Bitcoin and looking what it was, but always dismissed it because of the deflation. Now DOGE is uncapped, which changes a lot of things in my perspective.

Talladega, Sprint Cup.
You'll be able to tune in on Fox and see the car with the shibe face roll around the track at 200 mph.
This is going to be on everybody's Facebook front page, for sure.

It's game theory. If everybody used cash, then yes everyone would save 2%. But as long as credit card holders are the majority and that stores adjust the price upwards for everyone, not using a credit card is not an optimal strategy. Cause you pay 2% more, and you don't get your 1% cash back or whatever else you get.

TIL people with Bitcoins have not a single penny in government backed currencies, and don't own credit cards.

One is a currency, one is a business.
I think the difference is pretty large to be honest.
It's like asking why shareholders of McDonalds make money but that the Federal Reserve doesn't for producing US bills.

The only reason I'm still subscribed to this sub is because I want to have the freshest news from what's going on with Bitcoin, and this is the easiest way for me to do so.
Commentators on this sub are a serious pain in the ass though. Really no surprise that people are flocking to people don't have a stick in their ass up to their intestines over there, and don't have a real quick downvote click.

I'm just wondering, what's the use of that?
Having a debit card means that the company you are doing business with pays the debit fee. Isn't bitcoin's big advantage is that they want to take this out?
I just feel like rationally, using anything but a credit card is just not making the optimal financial decision.

I'm not sure you understand the blocking coalition that credit card buyers are.

Japan experienced deflation for almost a decade and suffered massively from it. We have experienced it before, it was not pretty.

Along that line, I suggest The Elusive Quest for Growth: Economists' Adventures and Misadventures in the Tropics by W. Easterly. It talks about how the World Bank changes constantly their way of giving money to poor countries to achieve the highest GDP growth, and realized that a lot of countries were doing bad on purpose so that they could continue to receive the funds.
Incentives are very important considerations when giving money to people. Even giving in education can be unproductive because those countries experience massive brain drain.
For those who won't read the book, the conclusion from what I remember was to create local industrial areas specialized in one industry. For example, have a pencil maker establish a factory in a town, and then have all the related suppliers establish themselves around. You basically create a small dense pool of knowledge and specialization. This is what we saw happen in many other countries which then experience massive growth. You just think of the city in China that produces the bulk of the world's socks production to see how it works well.

I love how is looking for a way to dismiss perhaps one of the greatest economists still living because of a statement he made about Bitcoin.
Says a lot about the "circlejerkist" status of this sub to be honest.
@_date: 2013-12-29 14:33:34
Hum,  no it's not. In 2012, the winners had an article about game theory, which has strictly nothing to do with central banking.

Is this supposed to be important? If you guys want to make Bitcoin a true competitor to paypal, you need to accept whatever mainstream company even though their corporate responsibility isn't stellar. I don't think Bitcoin is in any position to be picky about their clients, especially of that size.
