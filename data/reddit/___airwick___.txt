But if you think it'll be the opposite...doesn't that mean it'll come true?

It's a hard time to be a crypto  journalist.

Deposit coins, withdraw bitcoin

Twitter stats are so easy to artifically inflate, I would never try to rely on them

Insert quarters, get paid in bitcoin?

Are they hoping people don't notice the DPOS dumpster fire 
@_date: 2018-05-21 07:34:50
Can confirm. OK.
@_date: 2018-05-14 04:57:38
Or he could access the Bitcoin he has, you fucking shill cuck

Low effort

Stopped here. Idiot.

People buying in this market know to avoid a shitcoin

Well, if it becomes the global reserve currency $20k will be considered a steal. But short term, yeah they got burned 
@_date: 2019-01-21 02:14:07
If it is a global reserve currency, yes the value will be high. How would it not be? If you think bitcoin is dead, you deserve to stay poor

I usually disregard any post that starts with "I'm a X year old..." 
It's pandering in a way I can't really articulate.

@_date: 2018-02-21 15:30:57
Maybe you should just post them?

This is awesome! Now we just need LedgerDex (they can have the name)

I just don't think it needs to be prefaced with their age. If the app is good, let it stand on its own merits.
I'd rather it be "my app is impressive" than "my app is impressive because I'm 16"

Trezor is open source, and is subject to peer review. You don’t get to pick and choose who peer reviews your shit. No one would be screaming to “blackball” them if they said they did an independent audit, and found it was ironclad.
@_date: 2018-12-28 13:05:39
Blackball the people that figured out how to hack the most popular hardware wallets? Good idea
@_date: 2018-12-28 14:04:53
I don’t think the world of open sourced software is for you, buddy.
