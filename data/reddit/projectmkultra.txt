Lol, this is too rich - what happens when everyone sells in 2040? Y’all get rich right? Hahahaha

I’m sure you did, but I wouldn’t take that to the bank again.

Cause he’s smart and knows that BTC isn’t a long term investment.

The only people suggesting to hold are the ones with an exit strategy. The ones holding are going to be the big losers in the crash.

It means don’t think that it going up isn’t the same exact trap that most investors get stuck in thinking that things will always go up. There are very few winners and mostly losers.

You don't think people doing research don't post here sniffing out their next targets? You don't think they don't read these posts regardless or not if the OP is one of them? Good job creating a wealth of investigative material for them to snoop over.

lol, this is good, I'm fairly new to bitcoin...and I've made like 6 bets on SD...all at the 76% one or whatever, and have lost 5 of them. The chances of that happening on a completely random interval are like 1 in 20,000...98% payout my ass.
They are probably moving because there are laws that revolve around truth in advertising and they probably aren't advertising the right numbers.

Oh, so a site that is coded to win a certain amount of times...you are saying that the operators have no control of and also that it would be impossible to cheat?
Who has taken the time to verify that what they are saying is true?

I don't trust online gambling operations, that's just me. I lost all of .06 BTC so I'm not that exactly heartbroken over it. I still think it's odd that I lost 5 of 6 of 76% win chance, like I said, I did the quick math and there was very little chance of that happening. Hell, even losing 5 of 6 on a 50/50 is kinda rare.

Oh really pal? Well I better go take the time and write all of them down, do the math and figure out if they are telling the truth, friend. Thanks for the info, guy!
@_date: 2013-05-28 20:32:58
yes, sorry, that is what I meant

Anyone want to play "just the tip"?
@_date: 2013-06-24 18:49:15
Nice try banks and government 
@_date: 2013-05-10 04:09:02
OH BOY MY FIRST TIP!
@_date: 2013-05-16 20:02:37
Ya, I see the math, but 1 of 1256 is still makes me suspicious...
@_date: 2013-10-13 14:36:23
Well... Those are pretty secure.. 
@_date: 2013-05-16 06:58:33
So does 1 in 64 sound remotely close to 3 out of 4?
@_date: 2013-10-30 05:45:44
She's not mad because she didn't really have them to begin with. It's one of the lies people make up to feel "in". 
@_date: 2013-05-16 05:57:45
Well lets see...4 million+ bets made...you take a guess. I doubt there is any reason to not do it, BTC isn't a currency that is bound by the same laws that govt. backed currencies are.

I always thought it was obvious that Mohr's Law would be accounted for...this article is acting like it doesn't exist...
