AOL did what Bitcoin should do and pivoted before they went extinct.

Honest question. What happens to the network when no one is mining anymore?

But how much further ahead will Ethereum be by the time BTC catches up to where ETH is today?

Thank you for this. I did exactly as you did, and put aside mining because I had "better things" to do and didn't really mess with it again until Dogecoin gained reddit popularity and I decided to screw around with it for fun. And it was fun. But I've beat myself up far too much over that one decision all those summers ago. And I love that quote. I'm going to share that.

For those who were worried about US legislation on cryptocurrency *before* this news, prepare your anus.

We don't know, and will likely never know, how many people signed the whitepaper. Could be one person (male or female), or it could be the nom de plume of many people.

Satoshi is a group of men and women. Change my mind.

One name which could be used to represent multiple people. We literally cannot know for sure until we can definitively authenticate Nakamoto. Until then it remains unprovable. Anything else is unscientific conjecture.

Nope. It was at least two people, and I believe them to be of different sexes. Change my mind.

Then again, at the end of Daedalus and Icarus, the wings really do melt.
Daedalus warns Icarus about complacency and hubris, urging him not to fly too low to the sea or too high near the sun. Icarus ignores him, flies too high, the wings melt, and he plummets to the sea and drowns.
There's a lesson here for the Bitcoin community, indeed all cryptocurrency wonks: Don't let complacency or hubris guide your decisions to buy, sell, or hold.

It's fun to watch the psychology of loss play out in this subreddit evolve as the absurd speculation begins to settle.

Miners "died" in 2013. They "died" again in 2015. Now they're "dying" again in 2018-2019. Then some new algo will become fashionable and a whole host of new coins will emerge, and many of them will be mining-friendly. Then a few years later mining will "die" again.

And nobody would know about "Satoshi" without MtGox. The thing that gets the exposure isn't always the right thing to pay attention to, and just because a person doesn't get a lot of public acclaim doesn't mean they aren't worth your time.

If you don't want to become instantly rich and profit from this whole situation, why not donate the remaining coins to The Pineapple Fund and do some good with it?

Bought a house at 200k on a credit loan at 3.825% with 20k down payment. Invested the other 180k in vanguard funds. Sold said house 5 years later for $450k. Pocketed 250k in profits plus the compound interest gained on my 180k investment.
Sure, I could have paid 200k cash, but I would have missed that compound interest on my vanguard investment. And at an average annual rate of 7% on 180k, that's a decent amount of money.
So now you have an example of how credit is good when used responsibly. Talk it over with your parents at dinner tonight.

You're lying to yourself if you think the government couldn't seize the assets you've purchased in cash.
You need to stop thinking of life in the US as anything but life in a giant Disney style amusement park. You live entirely within a system they control. Trying to use Bitcoin within that system is like trying to spend Chuck E Cheese tokens within Disneyland.
