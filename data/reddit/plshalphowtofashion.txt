Nope. The pedantry is explaining the details of why what was said was technically not correct, and providing little tidbits of information that, while more accurate, don’t really matter. 
The OP of this post said you get extra hashing power. Which is fine, it’s close enough. The person at the top of this thread and yourself are correcting him with needless little details that don’t change the meaning of the post. Myself and others are pointing out that those details really don’t matter, and explaining why that’s the case.
But considering (as I’ve stated) this whole thread of comments really doesn’t matter at all, then a meta conversation about this thread itself, matter even less. So holy shit, move on.

Per $1,000 spent on electricity, using ASIC boost definitely nets more hashing power. If you have one ASIC, sure, it’s just less power. But when your upper limit is only how much power you are able (or willing) to consume, then using ASIC boost means less power per ASIC, therefore more ASICs, therefore more hashing power

We know what you meant. It’s just useless pedantry.

The point isn’t that it has value, the point is that it was private property and was taken.

Sure, take my salted password hash, maybe in 50 million years when you figure out what my password is then you'll realize that you need my 2FA as well.

I mean, do you want the car? Is the price good? What exactly is your question?
