You deposit cash on coinbase, use the same login credentials on gdax and transfer the cash from your coinbase account to gdax. Then you buy BTC with that cash at market price.

Interesting concept, they probably use that to boast anyone is actually using bcash. Funny stuff, much fun with your miner regardless. Are the dragonmints actually out yet? Last I heard they weren't. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 18:56:58
That would cause trouble trying to even out the resin as it would pull coins from the floor.

It's a jab at the volatility making it hard to use as a currency right now. Once the price becomes stable at whatever point it's going to be easier to calculate exchange value. Hejre's hoping it stabilizes at a million dollars.

I absolutely don't get where I would start with this. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 10:28:40
I don't think it will dip (but then who knows) and rather go up pretty fast. I watched Litecoin yesterday and once the 300€ sellwall was broken it pretty much went up to 320 in the blink of an eye. I guess it'll be slower with BTC since there is more people and the price has been higher in the past though. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:57:54
Stuff like this surprises me, but not the fact that someone is clever enough to use mining. No, I'm more surprised that a crypto sub is almost exclusively thinking this is bad when it's not. It helps decentralization enormously, it's a clever way to monetize websites without showing annoying ads and really everyone should be happy if that spreads a little. I'll happily donate unused resources to mine. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:27:15

I assume it was a wallet a couple people shared access to and I could see boss asking underling "hey, come here with the key" or the like, that's what I meant. 
I really have no idea how they worked internally but that's a possible scenario. I know at work the whole accounting staff has access to bank accounts so I assume this would be similar. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 08:50:08
Exactly, it's the reason why BTC just works while coins like the coin that shall not be named BCash that heavily relies on central figures doesn't.

No one knows. I'm actively testing the testnet version and it all looks fine right now. I'll also test it  with a bit of spare money once mainnet becomes testable (is it already?

A very brief tldr is that instead of signing 5 transactions when you pay from five sources you only need one anymore, cutting down a lot on transaction overhead.

If you are on coinbase go to gdax.com (same company), import your balance and place a limit order at market price. Zero fees. Also I don't like your tone in those other replies, but hopefully that helps you.
@_date: 2017-12-14 10:24:31
Makes transactions anonymous, there's no way of telling who got the money. If A pays C via B in the easiest example the final transaction will look different than what actually happened. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:19:15
Of course you can combine it with other advancements. Schnorr signatures come to mind, they make onchain-&gt;LN cheaper in most cases.

I don't have much to say to your story other than it was really enjoyable to read. 
But since we are sharing poker stories I love telling mine. I was in an online poker game way out of my league. I had made my way in as a freeroller earning a couple of bucks, but the site had a 50€ payout limit. I played my way through some knock-out games and ended up with about 30€ in like two weeks, got annoyed and decided to take that huge bankroll to enter a 30€ knockout tournament, win or bust. In about round five it's the first time I look at a flop and I get 4 of five cards for a straight flush, open ended. Basically the best you can get on a flop, but of course everyone sees the potential and if I go all-in they will probably give me the blinds. As I already was in that fuck-it-mentality I went all-in, everyone but one person leaves. Cards are open, he has the two low cards for the straight flush. Turn card is something unimportant, I begin to hope that I win with high card, then the river comes with the King that I needed for the straight flush and suddenly I had to play through the game into the middle of the night. I actually made my money back with the knockout boni, but barely. 
Tl;Dr: Won a game of poker with straight flush against flush.

I know right? It's amazing. Someone already created a woocommerce plugin (one of the biggest Wordpress plugins for e-commerce if you don't know) which opens up the world of thousands of sites to accept lightning out of the box. Yalls.org might revolutionize microblogging and paywalls, the blockaccino demo proves how easily it can be implemented in storefronts. I'm seriously hyped.

Gdax.com is the best. You can create an account for free and if you already have one at coinbase it's the same login. Then simply go to BTC/USD if it's not default and you can see the wall crumbling. Actually hurry up because there's only one third left as of now. 
Edit: Damn, went to a meeting and missed it disappear, so much for that. But in the future GDAX is where the fun happens :)

I think the two of us could start a holy war over which hardware wallet is best and I'll be right because the Trezor looks better. That would be more productive than this hellhole of a thread with all the Bcash crazies.

Just speculation, but it seems more than likely. The only way to 'hack' a wallet is to gain access to the private keys. That probably limits the number of failure points to a handful of people and either blatant theft or blatant stupidity if it was the result of social engineering. I mean I wouldn't give out the private key to anyone if not in person. 
Also there's the part where they stored ALL the money in one wallet, you can see that from the blockchain. There were five big transactions all from the same address, 4 with 1k coins and one a little smaller. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:28:51

Think of it as a prepaid card. You load it with an amount of coins and then you can use it everywhere where that card it's accepted because all are connected with the network. Lightning it's just like that, you don't open the channel with your coffee shop but with a hub, let's say PayPal to use an existing example. The only negative aspect is that you lose a little pic the decentralization. Not much however, if you don't trust let's say PayPal (I Simmons could imagine them jumping into the train, which our way I use the example) you can just connect to a different entry point or set up your own. How that makes sense

Eventually your wallet becomes a node on the LN. You put in say 1k$ because that's what you spend per month and everyone else on the LN can transact through you up to a maximum of 1k$. You as a user don't notice anything about that, only the small fee you get for routing.

Check out cloudgaming. I'm on a notebook for over two years now and haven't really gamed since and that looked quite interesting. Depending on the kind of gaming you do that can end up cheaper as long as your internet can handle it and it would stagger the costs over small monthly sums.

A simple hardware wallet prevents any keyloggers having effect. You would have to try pretty hard to fuck up to the point where you lose the key to the only (!) wallet holding the funds when basic op-sec would have prevented that. Hardware wallets, split accounts, maybe even multisig.

Erzgebirge for example, sounds very expensive at first but there are houses so cheap it makes you want to take the hit and live miles away from the next big city. East Germany has lots of towns that are basically ghost towns, I know someone who bought a house with a 30k heating installation for 20k, sold the heating and bought a car with the profit, house itself is abandoned since. I also saw one that was more a vacation house than an actual house but not bad either on the isle of Ruegen, I'm pretty sure that was either 30 or 40k and I seriously considered moving out there but I'm pretty tied to my city for my job so in the end I didn't. Anyway, logn text but those places are out there. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:05:40

Full quote (slightly butchered thanks to my memory) is even better: "I don't have to be insulted, I have enough money. I, I was a self-made multi-millionaire before bitcoin. (goes on about how the interviewer's site doesn't even gross a million dollars per year)"
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:12:16
that's right. At the very least get a phone wallet, but honestly you'll love a real hardware wallet like the Trezor / Ledger. If you want to stick around for the ride it's a great investment. There have been multiple times when exchanges were hacked and coins stolen in the past.

No because Alt-coins pretty much follow the value of BTC. If you really think it's going to crash it's a better idea to cash out.

You'll need sites that accept lightning of course, but with wordpress plugins already in the works and integration into existing wallets and payment systems imminent I'd say it's going to take days, maybe weeks until everyone left and right will be accepting it.

It's not about the investment advice, but rather pushing people headfirst into crypto-currency's existence. Then it's up to anyone to do their own research, but take me who works in IT and has known of BTC since at least three years but never really figured it was anything other than 'another paypal' until a few months ago.

not really, I first bought in at around 5k so I'm still up by a lot, and it'll likely recover. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:04:34
I'd say it's weird to see so many sites down at the same time, if it was just coinbase okay, it being the main entry point for beginners but literally every site I have used to buy is down. But yeah, probably natural DDOS as well, we'll see how it plays out. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 08:17:35
See, not long ago I bought a game on steam with BTC so I could rightfully say I had done something to further BTC adoption. I replenished that money right away, but it shows up each time I log into my Trezor as it's the only thing I spent so far.
When I bought it that number said "23€", now it's saying "40€"
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:16:26
I'm happy I have everything off of there in a hardware wallet, been using it to track stats only lately. Still I hope it'll recover soon, that's bad timing for a server outage.

You are unlikely to earn a decent sum of money when you take electricity into concern. If you are in the game for earning money you are better off just investing the cash into BTC directly. That being said it can be a lot of fun to mine, just don't throw money out of the window just to mine.

Completely opposite for me, I nearly stopped gaming completely about a year ago and the market hasn't really thrown up anything I desperately want to play.

In order to understand this you have to understand what miners can do with their 'power', which is simply deciding if they mine or don't mine BTC / any altcoin. That's intended and how this whole Fork business works, if there are enough miners interested in an altcoin they switch over to that. However that doesn't change much for the existing coin(s), they are just a little less decentralized. However the good thing is that in the worst case scenario where all the big players leave the actual mining difficulty decreases so it becomes profitable for amateurs to mine. It's a sort of self-healing system, quite clever.

I want one. It's probably super expensive but man, I want that. Probably much better to listen to than fan noise as well. Edit: The company has been acquired by BitFury:

Don't take advise from a stranger, but yes. I believe in its future, if you read up and spend research you'll probably end up kicking yourself for not doing that research earlier (as have I and most others) but it's not too late. Not by a long shot.

I remember two sites: Payhip and itch.io that I found quite interesting for indy-games / ebooks etc a while back, maybe those accept BTC? I don't know but it might be a starting point. payhip is also pretty anonymous as far as these things go.

When people say that they normally ask for porn, but then Crypto is nothing but(t).

Oh, for some reason I misjudged the scale of that thing. Probably the big numbers next to it. In a month I'll ask if that's a real tesla.

Appreciated. I've just played and liked a very noir-ish game called the detail that was pretty fun, quick to complete but cool nonetheless.

I'd say that put things in perspective if there had been any doubt left. It's amazing for platforms that handle trading in times of free scaling cloud services, load balancing etc.

It's weird lagging behind the US, but in crypto we are all equal eh?

If only the Titanic could have eaten icebergs like BTC eats sell walls. Did you get my edit? Maybe the port is not forwarded correctly?

This rings very true for me, right now my desktop pc isn't working because my mainboard and / or cpu is fried and there's an amazon deal for a new one but since I hardly play games anymore I can't bring myself to spend the money.

Something like the Topgear "work harder, buy a car" would be epic.

I'm not so sure about mobile devices but the majority of earnings will likely come from desktop computers. I'm still experimenting with the concept (only had in on there a couple of days now). I think in theory it's an amazing way to monetize a site, if it works out I could get rid of annoying ads. It's also helping out the network (monero in this case though, that seems to be the go-to for both of the two services I found for this) and could make mining pretty decentralized so I think overall it's a great concept.
I throttled it to 40% to make sure it's as unobstrusive as possible, in fact I mine with my own notebook just to test and I could edit a video in Sony Vegas just fine (not rendering, but editing). 
I haven't tested with my own phone yet, I'll switch it on and see if it gets hot. I could potentially disable mobile mining / throttle it to 0%. Thanks for the feedback, I'm excited for this technology and want to test it for a couple months. Edit: I tested it for ten minutes on 90% on my Samsung A5 phone and didn't notice any warming up at all so I think 40% for the short duration most people stay on comic sites shouldn't even be noticed. 
Edit: There's also an option to erect a sort of pay-wall where I can set a site to only be accessible if the user has mined a certain time, basically a mini-Patreon page. Quite interesting times indeed.
