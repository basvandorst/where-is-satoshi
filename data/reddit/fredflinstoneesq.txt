I have sent him several PM's. Google doesn't show any results for bitinstant forums.
@_date: 2013-04-09 20:43:49
I had two deposits:
Order ID: 3686b767-23ae-4e44-adde-68d260deb613	
The exchange rate you gave me was 240.516628, but MtGox had it at 236 when I made the deposit.
Order ID: bc4560fe-fb8e-41cb-a4de-9c4c17790bcd	
This order has not shown up, even though it was deposited just a few minutes after the first order.
Please let me know what's going on. 
Frederick Flinstone, Esq.

Why would you be defending BitInstant. Did you even read what I wrote? I was in no way whining.

How did you try contacting them? They email you the deposit receipt from support but that is not their support email and they don't check it. You need to contact them through 
I made an order on April 9th that never went through. I had sent them many emails to support PM on reddit, posting in threads like these on reddit and got terrible responsiveness, but as soon as I used the URL above I got instant response and have been working with URSAY all day (with several responses from him very quickly) and he's working on fixing it as we speak. I'll reply here with the outcome.

While this is true, I had planned on using those bit coins for a purchase.

I posted this, but my comment got buried. You replied an hour ago that you were looking into this but I haven't heard back yet:
I've been trying to get in touch with you since the 9th. I've PM'ed you, emailed you and called with no response. I made a deposit using the bitcoin address option, instead you sent the money to MtGox using my bitcoin address as the MtGox account number. I've since received two emails from MtGox support in the time it's taken to get none from you. MtGox says you will have to amend it. I was using that deposit to fund a transaction, since I didn't get the deposit I was unable to make the transaction and bitcoin soon crashed. I would greatly appreciate it if you could correct this problem and honor todays exchange rate when you do.

Except ones that ban memes and delete unproductive comments.

actively removes comments. does the same.
@_date: 2013-04-15 02:20:23
Any update?
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:45:40
I just tried that. It says, "You don't have any pending redeem codes." BitInstant didn't have my MtGox account number. They used my personal wallet address as my MtGox account number.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:28:14
What MTGOX code? They sent the money to MTGOX using my bitcoin address, not an actual MTGOX account number.

I would be happy to use your service again if I knew I could get support when I needed it. I'm still waiting for a deposit I made on April 9th! You replied on reddit yesterday saying you were looking into my transaction but never got back to me. Again:

I'm not demanding anything. I am simply using the service exactly as they advertise the service to work. The infrastructure is in fact in place to do what they advertise, they just had a technical glitch and screwed up my deposit.
