In time reputable custodian banks will appear to babysit and transact Bitcoin on behave of to companies and regular folks. Because people are just to stupid to hold there own keys "most of them are not you guys and girls "

That's a bad back up fail safe plan

It's verry important because no real wealth will park in Bitcoin if it's not generations safe like gold or real estate.

Nobody can distinguish real diamonds from real man grown diamonds. And yes it's to perfect and that's how they can tell but even imperfections can be implemented if needed. So if diamonds get to become the world's reserve store of value it's going to mass man made.

Yes but no transaction no fees. And not alive is not of importance as the elite won't invest if the asset burns out

I am right do the math check the wallets. Problem is Bitcoin has its on 1%ers so the problem continues even after adoption should happen. It's the wales that block adoption it's not healthy for that small number of wallets to hold such a portion of all Bitcoin. Adoption will happen as soon as they sell out.

I would propose a number of sats that automatically get deducted from every wallet for the miners on a daily base. This to pay the miners to maintain the network after the last coin is mined and there are not enough transaction to maintain the incentive to mine. In this way we would ensure that mining continues. Plan B is implement bigger blocks and faster blocks so it's not only a "store of value" in due time but a thrue payment system to buy a coffee. And no we don't won't any fork or alt to do this but it's time to start implementing some shit we learned from shitcoins. And take al the good tricks and bring them to Bitcoin.

I didn't know that Bitcoin is quantum proof any sources on that ?

Yes And who wil pay the miners

If that would be the case there wouldn't be any Bitcoin left. Remember 21million Bitcoin and 35million millionaires in the world. So a lot lot lot of them still didn't smell the �� ��

Nobody will be interested in an asset where 99% is locked out forever. Even if 50% is lost forever I think it's going to become a deal breaker

Let's adopt a way to calculating value of Bitcoin based on the population of the planet
@_date: 2019-12-08 08:34:19
But what if we al the people of the world are there own bank. Half the Bitcoin supply would get lost within 10years. People are still to stupid to hold private keys.

When it was like 60 euro it was on TV here in a small docu in the news. I was in a bear grillz face making fire with sticks. I learned a lot then and laughed the digital money away preparing for the end of the world. Now it's my biggest regret ever oke I can make fire with sticks now and know how to trap. I can make moonshine and have a lot of weapons. But I still regret not buying Bitcoin til this day. But still glad I got I dca from mid 2017 still in the usd loss but got the sats.

The average bread price per country. And does average priced against the average price of al country's on the planet. And that price outcome will be the price to follow

@_date: 2019-12-06 22:12:12
This would set a good value based on something nobody could control or manipulate the price of. The bread price system would make it a good store of value. You would at least know what a Bitcoin +- is worth and 1 bread will always be 1 bread it's not socialism it's just easy and fair. If Bitcoin won't get some updates soon it's going to burn out.

Not a conflict. If I would generate an address that has already Bitcoin in it. I would move it in an instant. So why would this not be a conflict? The chances are astronomicaly small but theoretically possible.

But forking and making a Satoshi's more devidable is also inflation or not ? Give it another name but cutting it op makes inflation
