Yes, I believe there are only two Blockstream employees working on the Lightning Network. They are also the two moderators of the lightning-dev mailing list.

It's the reference client from which all others are based. Any changes such as SegWit, for example, are first introduced in Bitcoin Core. Furthermore, the Bitcoin Core development team has final say on protocol changes.
@_date: 2017-12-25 19:09:07
Bitcoin Core is not working on the Lightning Network. The Lightning Network is a separate platform with its own dev teams and varying implementations.

Bcash does not have a formal organization or CEO. Let's not stoop to spreading misinformation. Bitcoin does have a reference client and an improvement process. BIPs that are approved are commited to the Bitcoin Core wallet first and then spread to other node clients and wallets. Furthermore, all consensus changes must first be adopted by the Bitcoin Core client. If you have information to the contrary please present it.

I thought the UASF movement showed there were tons of SegWit supporters? If so many people were already using SegWit compatible wallets why are SegWit transactions still at around 10%?

Segwit does not remove any ASIC advantage. It *may* prevent **covert** use of ASICBOOST but even that's questionable since anyone using ASICBOOST covertly can simply choose to not include Segwit transactions in a block. Furthermore, anyone can use ASICBOOST. The only concern with it are the patents around it. I personally see ASICBOOST use as a non-issue. Its only real benefit is power savings. It's also not exclusive to Bitmain. Far from it. However, Bitmain did manage to secure a questionable Chinese patent on it. It's most likely invalid and just needs to be challenged.
The reason for it being invalid? Bitmain didn't invent it. It was invented by Timo Hanke and Sergio Lerner who have applied for patents all over (including China) and have definitely been granted a patent for it in the US.
The whole patent situation, by the way, is very worrying. Blockstream, for this reason, instituted a Defensive Patent License. I still have major concern over this, however, since they are a for-profit company and it's up in the air as to what will happen with the patents if the company is sold or goes out of business. Furthermore, the Defensive Patent License *does not cover hardware patents*. ASICBOOST falls under this category.
tl;dr - SegWit only prevents covert use of ASICBOOST and even that has a workaround. ASICBOOST is patented by Timo Hanke and Sergio Lerner in the US (with applications pending in other countries including China).

bc1 *is* a segwit address. It's a bech32 Segwit address.

This is about Bitcoin.com though. Roger Ver took control of it in 2014. Before that it was owned by blockchain.info, iirc.

Did they fix the issue with change from Segwit transactions being sent to a non-Segwit address?

Do you mean these parts?




That whole PDF states there is no organization and any and all titles are imaginary and made up. Do you have anything that contradicts this?

Just to clear things up - LN does not require Segwit. LN requires a malleability fix. LN is a protocol that can be utilized by most cryptocurrencies that do not suffer from malleability. Monero, for example, does not have Segwit but does not have a malleability problem so, if the protocol is fully developed and tested successfully, LN can be deployed on that cryptocurrency (and many others as well).

I'm not sure what you mean. Check out web.archive.org. Bitcoin.com used to redirect to bitcoin.co which would redirect to bitcoin.org. So I'm not sure how you can say

I don't get it. Bitcoin is a currency. Banking is an amalgalm of a variety of financial services (lending, safe-keeping, etc.) The two are not mutually exclusive and comparing one to the other is an "apples to oranges" affair.

I have no idea why they're trying to pass these regulations in the form that they're currently in. This directly impacts interstate and international trade and is thus unconstitutional (only the Federal government can control interstate and international trade).
Anyway, here's the link to the NYS Department of Financial Services press release:

The Internet itself is a network of private networks. That is its very definition.
@_date: 2015-05-21 22:30:48
A privately controlled network can be worldwide. Look at banks, for example. The Internet is just a network that connects them but they can be isolated as well. In fact, years ago, some where. Sprint's Telenet, for example. Today, you've got Internet2. That's aside from large scale corporate WANs, of course.
As for trustlessness, that's what the blockchain's all about. You don't trust a central authority to keep the ledger but you don't trust the individual nodes as well. That's why every transaction needs to be verified.
@_date: 2015-05-21 21:58:20
What I mean is plenty of companies and organizations have networks made up of networks.
@_date: 2015-05-21 22:07:18
They are not fundamentally different at all. They use the same equipment and protocols.
@_date: 2015-05-21 21:50:07
The Internet is a collection of networks and a lot of those networks have smaller networks within them.
Anyway, blockchains serve a specific purpose. If you have a need to use one, then why not use one? For a lot of things you can use a database but when you don't want a single point of failure and want to distribute data across a variety of possibly-unreliable nodes then, why not?
@_date: 2015-05-21 22:13:47
No there aren't. I dont understand what you're arguing. The Internet is just an IP network that connects other IP networks. Hell, IP itself stands for Internet Protocol.

I'm not really sure his counterpoints reaffirm Greg's arguments. Can you elaborate? Lightning Network routing is an extremely complex problem and Greg's post is, unfortunately, a somewhat erroneous oversimplification of it.
I highly recommend reading this lighting.engineering post ([ which is a high level overview of how Lightning Network routing should work. Please look at it with a crtiicial, debugging eye. There seem to be a few issues that are visible to me such as the assumption that, overall, transactions will be symmetrical (i.e. the amount of money being routed out and routed in by routing nodes eventually balancing out) and network centralization due to how the Lightning Network Autopilot works (see, for example, [

However, this invalidates all previous backups. This would be as much of a backup as a RAID. It's not a backup at all but a redundant copy that takes over if the primary goes down. So, in short, backups are impossible. One must maintain a separate copy instead.

I'm not sure that's accurate. The issue with knowing all current channel states is the "current" part. Since channel states are dynamic and not static (unlike a blockchain ledger that stores all previous transactions in a static state), one would have to continuously poll the Lightning Network to determine current channel states. As the Lightning Network grows, this can become unscalable very fast especially if the amount of time needed to ascertain all current channel states takes too long (and the channel states change while this is happening).
@_date: 2018-03-24 12:19:10
Timo Hanke owns the US patents (and at least one Chinese patent, iirc) not Bitmain. Covert and overt are covered by the same patent. The ASICBOOST FUD always struck me as a red herring. There was never an issue with anyone else using ASICBOOST (assuming Bitmain was using it) aside from its incompatibility with Stratum. That incompatibility has been fixed.
@_date: 2018-07-06 14:35:31


Doesn't this mostly describe the Lightning Network? Those with more BTC committed to their nodes get more transactions running through them, increasing their holdings. They can afford to run full nodes that have 100% uptime. Regular users either use the equivalent of SPV wallets or hire watchtower services.
Or am I missing something?
@_date: 2018-07-24 01:07:15


I don't understand your comment. This isn't about a distro trying to change what node they provide by default. This is about Luke-jr trying to get Bitcoin Knots to be the default Bitcoin implementation on Gentoo.

Only one Internet? Sure. Only one widespread public network? I don't think so. There was CompuServe, Telenet, etc. Telenet, by the way, went into service in 1974 so it predates the Internet by quite a few years.
