I understand this part.


This is the part that is unfamiliar to me.
I don't have a wallet.  Do I need a wallet or can I just create a new address using Brainwallet, and then transfer from the public address into my newly created address?

Let's say I have the private key associated with this address 17yfVxZJjCCyDHhcFuPN8FNDUormqtEF3J
How would I transfer the Bitcoin from the [author's address]( into my own?

I know that!  Let's hypothetically assume there is a Bitcoin in that address and I know the pass phrase to that address so I can generate the private key.  How would I transfer that Bitcoin into another address that I hold the private key to?

Did you read the article I linked to?  The guy told us his public address (i.e. 1KRGyNbq2yM1vAXscib74Snp6AUuUHVi2g) and then begged us to crack his password.  My question is, how do I attempt to access the funds in this address?
I went here [ and was able to view the history of transactions for this address but I don't get how I would transfer the Bitcoins out of that account (assuming it still had one in there).
