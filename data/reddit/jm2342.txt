Well, I couldn't resist:

Just imagine how nice it would be if we can finally hold our politicians accountable without even having any money, maybe, i don't know, by voting for them?
@_date: 2018-01-12 22:26:58
Oligarchs fighting Oligarchs just proves the point.

Your marketing sucks.
@_date: 2017-12-29 10:00:25
Or maybe, just maybe, people are not as criminally inclined as you expect them to be.
@_date: 2018-09-10 15:50:38
Not voting is a choice, too.
@_date: 2018-08-28 21:57:44
I'm wondering more about what it will take for that poor soul to finally wake up and snap.
@_date: 2017-02-22 23:01:07
Proposing bills without understanding the subject matter...what could possibly go wrong?
@_date: 2016-03-12 03:39:05
"but most voters find it acceptable"
You may want to reconsider your assumption that a majority of voters know what they are doing.
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:17:30
And they needed 3 years for THAT? And then waited until the last minute? Fucking clowns. Who needs them anyway.
@_date: 2016-06-20 14:00:22
That doesn't prove anything. Please elaborate. What are the problems?

If everyone pays high fees it still won't go any faster for the majority.
@_date: 2017-04-30 07:16:20
In an ideal world, no. But in an ideal world, there would be no poor to begin with, and this has nothing to do with taxes.
@_date: 2016-02-10 06:11:38
U mad, pal? Time spent wisely.

What sane person has personal information on Facebook?

Don't you have something better to do with your time? Also, wrong sub.
@_date: 2016-02-10 10:38:29
Well, then...what sane person has gullible ~~idiots~~ volunteers as friends? Oh wait, that's smart, actually. Nevermind.
@_date: 2017-04-29 21:44:52
You want the poor and the weak to come after you? Then rethink your attitude. Not to mention you could be one of them some day. I'm sure you would rather kill yourself than being a drain on society, amirite?

Please explain how logic creates rights.
@_date: 2019-01-05 14:07:16
I believe you are claiming that, within the US legal system, the right to collect taxes doesn't follow logically from some axioms, ie. the US constitution, and therefor is illegal, as defined by the same system, which the majority just fails to recognize. Is that right?
I thought you were talking about rights in general, which are subjective, defined anyone who wants and enforced by anyone who can.
Still, you haven't shown how it is illegal within that framework. I'm not familiar with the US constitution, does it prohibit taxation? Or does it explicitly prevent exceptions to property rights? Are owed taxes owned by you in the first place?
@_date: 2019-01-05 13:44:11
Give me an example. Show me how "ownership" (ie. the right to use something while at the same time prohibiting others from using it) is not granted by society but by logic (the specific right, not the concept, which is logical).
@_date: 2019-01-05 11:56:21
It is theft from your perspective, not from theirs. You have incompatible values. But then you cannot talk about theft. If you use their definition (or morality), it's not theft, and if you use your own, well, that's just your opinion, man, but then why don't you just say "I don't want it, period." instead of trying to conjure up non-sensical arguments?
@_date: 2019-01-05 13:41:06
They don't recognize anything, they CLAIM it to be the case, and you failed to explain HOW it is the case (how rights derive from logic).
@_date: 2019-01-05 11:51:00
Quite the opposite, consensus is the only thing that can give you any right, as it creates it in the first place.
@_date: 2019-01-05 13:52:13
1. That's your definition of ownership, society (or anyone else) may have a different one. You have to agree on one definition for it to become "universal". Logic doesn't dictate it, it's entirely subjective.
2. That definition concerns your body, not your taxes.
3. By your own definition, since you don't control your taxes, you don't own them. Hence no theft.
@_date: 2019-01-04 01:20:09
@_date: 2019-01-05 01:45:58
If you live in a democracy, then it's not theft but consensus.
@_date: 2019-01-05 13:36:28
Your argument that logic creates rights is that the US constitution says it is so...no further questions.

McCartney looks so young in this video.
@_date: 2017-09-13 08:34:50
You can vote. Not all the time, but you can. So "no choice" is clearly wrong.
@_date: 2017-10-07 11:11:07
How are hardforks dangerous? And who is "many"?
@_date: 2015-11-12 22:59:46
The real problem is that one has to pay for legal defense, and that the amount one pays positively correlates with the quality of the defense. Absurd, but well accepted.
@_date: 2015-11-21 15:37:52
But why do you hate it? Don't you like swaying masses at will? Or are you just envious?
@_date: 2015-11-06 12:12:00
Only a minority of people is able to choose where to live.

You know what's also unhelpful? Editing your previous comment without notice after people have already replied.
Other than that, i agree with you.

Changing definitions arbitrarily to suit your needs would be useful? No shit!
@_date: 2018-12-28 09:57:03
It would kill the parts of the economy that are not really needed. It would shrink and stabilize at a lower level, not die.

Similar thing happened to me a few months ago. It's like they hate customers. Well, no money for you. They were usable, once upon a time. Makes no sense. Too much cocaine is my best guess.

If by Rootstock you mean Ethereum, then yes.
