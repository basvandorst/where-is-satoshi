So what value does he pay taxes on? The value of BTC gained at the time or by the end of the year? Does he pay taxes on USD gained when he sells too? So he gets double taxed?

Because a Bitcoin IOU isn't FDIC insured as far as I'm aware.

Exactly. That's why I'm waiting for $2005. Snatch them up before the $2000 people even get the chance!

If history is any lesson regarding security and safety, companies will neglect them until they are regulated.
