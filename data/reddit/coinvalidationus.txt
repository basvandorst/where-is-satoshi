To me that's a big appeal of bitcoin.  I want to keep my money out of that system. I prefer bitcoin to cash in the mattress.

You're making the assumption that people will actually be willing to read the words you wrote instead of taking one look at the image; having a reaction and moving on.  You're trying to pull of a nuanced trick which usually ends badly.  It reminds me of Michael Richards "racist rant."  Obviously do what you want however I (obviously again) recommend you consider what people here are saying and what your ultimate goal for the article is.

Because this is a reason for people who have bitcoin to spend it (on the stuff at Dell).  It's not a reason for people who don't have bitcoin to buy it.
@_date: 2014-07-20 05:36:49
It's using something offensive and provocative that creates an immediate emotional reaction and then trying to be cute and say "not really!"  Bullshit.  It's childish and dishonest.
Or in terms you might actually understand if you have to explain the joke it wasn't funny in the first place.

@_date: 2014-07-21 16:18:02
You're playing a risky game if you expect people to respond emotionally the same way that you would respond.  I'd just remove the source of confusion as it isn't adding value.  A Monopoly Man banker would probably work better especially in the context of having Uncle $crooge and the Dragon.
At the end of the day is it an article about hoarding Bitcoin or is it an article about Jewish stereotypes?  It's a curveball at the end of an otherwise benign article.

I don't think you know what the word racist means.  I put the definition for your benefit however it was obviously a failed effort.  Carry on.
@_date: 2014-07-21 08:05:55
I don't have a problem with caricatures of individuals.  A picture of Jay Leno's big chin or Obama's big ears isn't targeting a group of people in order to subjugate them.  
Racist cartoons are a technique used to dehumanize a group of people to make them seem inferior/different/other which makes it easier to convince people to use violence/discriminate against that group.  
If you think it's just a joke you are also not very bright.  
@_date: 2014-07-21 14:49:53
Because you have an ego and assume strangers will think the same way you do.  That's a common problem for writers and people surrounded by like minded individuals.  
Blaming the audience for "not understanding" is the height of ego.  You're the writer.  It's your job to make people understand.  If there's something mudding up your message remove it.
@_date: 2014-06-27 23:19:45

Does it matter?  Every day we decide on the arbitrary value of things.  We decide a BMW is worth more than a Fiat.  We decide that rent in New York is more than rent in Cheyenne.  I get confused why people are so perplexed by this concept.  Just yesterday I was thinking "who the hell is selling bitcoin for $530?"  Someone decided it was worth $530 but I didn't.  Apparently most people agreed with me because it's above $530.  Simple.

I've noticed that with localbitcoins in Los Angeles.  Many people don't want to agree to rate until you actually meet.  I avoid them because it isn't worth my time to meet unless the terms are settled.  Also when I sold people were always trying to get a lower rate than I listed in the ad.
@_date: 2013-11-18 01:44:56
They didn't rip you off.  They didn't process your transactions.  There's a difference.

Fuck that lawyer.  She's terrible.  She wants everything to work outside of the USA.
@_date: 2013-11-20 02:52:38
so the pizza place now owes tax on that $6 Million.  Sounds like something the USA would implement.
@_date: 2013-11-18 02:38:11
Obviously they can decide not to process transactions.  Anyone who's been paying attention knows that.

bitcoin is easy to spend.  I have to be careful because I keep spending too much!
@_date: 2013-11-21 01:59:40
You might want to see if any of your employees/owners/suppliers are willing to take bitcoin as part of their compensation.  Then it won't be an issue.  You're prices are so low (which is awesome) that I can't imagine it would be that difficult to get rid of the amount that you get in.  Or maybe just incorporate it into your social giving platform and use bitcoin for donations.  Finally you should reach out to Whollyhemp (see moderators on lower right).  He's a successful retailer and probably has advice.
@_date: 2013-11-18 02:42:56
Exactly.  "Ripoff" implies that they took money and didn't provide a service.  Or worse, stole directly from a customer account (MF Global).  The OP is overreacting.  He's still entirely whole.  They didn't rip him off.  If people don't like it they should just pay the premium (and the hassle) to use localbitcoins.com
@_date: 2013-11-20 02:50:58
Yeah, she didn't get that businesses are already collecting tax for bitcoin transactions.  
@_date: 2013-11-17 23:12:54
"associated?"  as in bitcoin is "bad" or "taboo?"  I think those days are over especially for global companies.  If you mean risk as far as storage, security, etc. they can use SecondMarket as a third party.

Also, I insisted on escrow.  In my opinion it wasn't worth the risk to take the time to go meet someone unless I knew the coins were actually there for the agreed upon price.

If you spend it you should replenish.

I shop on Giftcardzen.com and I really like their interface.  I think they use coinbase which is nice for people in the US because (unless I'm wrong) you can spend without transfer fees.  Works great.

They'll probably auction it to an institutional buyer who will hold it.  So no disruption.

It's similar to April.  A bunch of frenzied interest and the exchanges go to shit because they can't handle the volume.  Yawn.  Even the handful of people who bought at $260 in April look like geniuses now.  Hold.  Unless you're a chump.
@_date: 2013-11-21 00:06:25
I'm in the USA and work for a global company based in Austria.  If they accepted bitcoin payment they could reduce exchange fees. For example, 12 currencies to Euro becomes a simple bitcoin conversion to Euro using a company like Bitpay.  Or they can set it up to have bitcoin converted into the home currency of their employees.  Or close the chain and just pay in bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-18 19:26:36
No questions asked, face to face, immediate service.  localbitcoins should be the most expensive way to purchase coin.  Imagine a bank officer meeting you on your schedule to cash a check.  How much would that cost?

@_date: 2013-11-20 20:59:57
yeah, when it's crazy the seller is at a disadvantage with volatile rates.  If it goes up they (theoretically) miss out; if it goes down the buyer can just no show.  Still, I can't feel too sorry for sellers because the buyer is usually paying a high premium and if the seller is smart they already made their money when both parties agreed on a price.
