It's a gamble. You can do research and spread that $1,000 across 10 coins or tokens and even if 9 fail and one goes up then you are golden. Also helps if you aren't in a hurry because you might not see a return for 6 months but then buckle you seatbelt. For example if you had bought $1,000 in network coin last week you would be looking a $34,000 + return today.

Usually if a lot of people sell large amounts of coins it spooks people and the price drops. However these sellers are getting overshadowed by the people that are still buying.

Not him, but I would not. Here's why: I invested $1,000 of extra cash. If I lose it all then I won't be that upset. It's just $1k. Now if I had bought $100,000 with my life savings then it would be a different story. However I'm not a moron so I didn't invest what I couldn't afford to lose.

I think the point is you never have to sell ALL of them. Sell 5% every once and awhile. Trade some for other alts here and there to diversify.

Dude they already told you that those people would contact the exchange directly to get the money out. I can't tell if you are trolling or what but try and read next time.

Someone sold $25 million in one pop a couple weeks ago so it's not unlikely
