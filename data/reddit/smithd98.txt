Sounds like you would know how to throw a meetup people enjoy - which is something lacking from a lot of these tech type meetups.
I definitely think you should have a meetup!
I'm here in Michigan - back in 13 meetups were getting about 5-10 people. Now bitcoin meetups are getting 15-30 and Ethereum is like 60+ - although that may have more to do with strength of the organizing teams than be a statement about the technology.
On the other hand I do enjoy the Ethereum meetups these days more than bitcoin meetups. At Ethereum I'm learning about new tech where as bitcoin meetups have a lot of price / big block / small block / etc. talk.

Watch for scams on localbitcoins.
I've done a couple 20K buys through Coinbase, but like others said I've had my account and limits in order since mid 2013.
If I were in your shoes I'd contact SecondMarket. If I recall correctly they take a 5% fee and have a 25K minimum. If you PM me I'll send you an email or phone number of an account exec there.
Not sure how fast they transact as I haven't used them, but I think it is your best shot since Circle and Coinbase have software limits in place.

The problem is, many people, like myself, can't laugh and ignore regs like this. It doesn't make sense for me to risk jailtime or legal battles for a business and I can't move out of the country for a while.
Most Americans are in the same position. Regs like those will slow down bitcoin adoption.

I've used bitcoins to buy real world items and alt coins. The existing system means I need to use software to understand the price of an asset. Either by converting to dollars or to understand how many decimal places the price is. Converting to bits fixes the issue.
For example:
Which is greater .000001 bitcoins or .0000001 bitcoins? In trading and in purchasing decimals like that don't work. With large numbers commas quickly show which is greater: 100,000 vs. 1,000,000. and then it can even be 100.1K or 1.1mm. much easier than the existing system.

I agree he is in a bad situation. There is risk no matter what he does.
I don't think advising to hold is horrible advice. If he realizes bitcoin might go to $0. It might be the wrong thing to do it might not. How will he feel if he sells and bitcoin does recover or goes higher? I didn't sell last year in November because I knew I'd feel worse if I got out and bitcoin went up than if bitcoin went to $0.
I don't regret my decision even though it cost me a lot of money.  I made the correct decision for me at that time given the information I had.

A better Coinbase minus the payment processor part.
I've recommended a few people buy through Coinbase who couldn't figure it out. Circle is going to kill it if they get the UI right, 0% fees, and insured deposits. I bet they have 20K - 50K people on their waiting list and I expect a good number of them have never bought bitcoin before.

Right on. The interest in bitcoin would be much smaller without the volatility. Many people got in last May / November because of the investment opportunity. That's what got me in. Then I figured out bitcoin was much more. I figured out it was the most empowering technology since the internet. But without the 'sexy' volatility I would not have put the time in to learn about it.

I've had this happen on 3 or 4 Coinbase payments to non-Coinbase addresses. And emailed them about it 2 or 3 times. It has been an issue for the past year.

They don't need an incentive, but this makes them give up $100 of value by not engaging. Convenience is king. The best way to introduce bitcoin to someone isn't to tell them about it, but to give them $5 worth through coinbase over email. They will be shocked they got money that fast.
@_date: 2014-05-30 10:44:58
Totally agree! And I think we'll get there, but today it's the other way around. For example I'm going to have an event where newbs get intro'ed to bitcoin and part of the event will be to spend bitcoin. It is going to be a pain in the arse for 75% of them because they'll have iPhones. I'll have to come up with a workaround (thinking paper wallets) and explain that it is Apple being jerks not a problem with bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-05-30 10:49:20
I don't see how it won't. In that worldview bitcoin is irrelevant and I'm a bull. If Apple loses ~5% of iPhone users to Android per year because of bitcoin that is billions of dollars. I believe they will absolutely make the change. I just want it to be now.

I don't think bitpay is lowering the market cap. When someone uses Bitpay the bitcoins don't disappear. They are sold to someone. The amount in existence and in people's hands is the same. Bitpay just increases liquidity - adding a 'sink' for bitcoins in one place and a 'faucet' for bitcoins in another.

I agree. I have about 6 coinbase accounts. One account was on that list (not my oldest) and that account received the requests and ONLY that account.

Since you didn't know what I meant it sounds like you haven't used bitcoin as much as I have or are better at counting repeating digits on a screen than I am.
Getting the count correct is critical because it is an order of magnitude difference.

It sounds like Second Market will be first. Winkelvii are waiting on the SEC.

I think the best way to promote bitcoin would be to use your celebrity to get Australians to buy and use bitcoin. One way that comes to mind is having signings or some other type of event where the participants have to send 25 cents worth of bitcoin to participate. That way people will need to figure out how to get and spend bitcoins. I would also put up a webpage to make it easy for them. You could loop in brick and mortar places by holding your events at their locations if they accept bitcoin.

I think you link the Uber account to a public bitcoin address. They can see your balance and you verify you control it by signing a message with the private key. When payment is due they know you are good for it. If not they lost out on the cost of the ride and you are banned as a customer / sent to collection / etc. Maybe they couple this with a deposit as well or have cc as backup payment.

TLDR: FREE webinar 9/3 8:00 PM Eastern Time on making money by lending money at BTC Jam

Text minus the boilerplate and contact info:
Can Investors Safely Earn Good Returns In a Flat Market?
BTC Jam Claims High Returns are Possible.
Investors today are searching for yield. Savings accounts and bonds are at their lowest levels in years. However peer-to-peer lending sites like Prosper have been providing nice returns for investors. BTC Jam takes this a step further by opening the peer to peer lending market internationally.
To explore this opportunity, David Smith, owner of Bitcoin Bulls is teaming up with BTC Jam to offer a webinar on September 3rd at 8:00 PM Eastern Time explaining how the site works, why it works, what the risks are, and how to reduce the risks. Investment portfolios adhering to the strategies discussed have realized market-pummeling returns.
Chief Marketing Officer Flavio Rump explains, “Other countries are used to paying over 100% interest per year.” This creates an arbitrage opportunity for U.S. investors to lend money overseas and earn what is considered a high rate of return here, while providing what is considered a low interest rate overseas. It is a win-win.
The webinar is September 3rd at 8PM Eastern Time interested users can register online here:

I feel your pain! On my first transaction with them I used bitcoin from Coinbase and like you said they broadcast it 4 hours later, well outside the 15 minute window. BitPay's support was awesome and sent me 3 emails in  less than a day to sort it out. I contacted Coinbase support about it to, but didn't get a resolution to the issue. I've been disrupted multiple times by their delayed sends. Now I don't use them when speed is key.
@_date: 2014-03-13 02:20:02
Wow, that is horrible :( Look this is so great! Oh wait, Coinbase doesn't broadcast :( I've had it happen to me a few times. Big pain in the neck, although never at the level you experienced.

Thanks for the feedback and examples.
You are right I am pro bitcoin. Out of the 47 articles I've written two caution investors. You are right on the figure part, I changed it from 180k to 193K and it didn't all update at once.
The reason I write these articles is because I believe what I'm writing. The ebook is free and downloaders are added to a free newsletter service. From the newsletter service I hope subscribers find value and subscribe to a paid monthly product ($22).
In that product I do more analysis of upside and downside risks. However I think everyone should own some amount of bitcoin today and that is reflected in all my writings.
I think everyone who knows about but doesn't hold some amount of bitcoin today is making an error. I believe bitcoin as an investment has a positive expected value. Some people should have $5 worth and some people should have millions worth, but everyone should have some.

It won't be irrelevant to those who don't care about the price because an increasing price increases investor and entrepreneur interest in bitcoin which will accelerate and increase bitcoin ecosystem development.
If bitcoin hadn't taken off like a rocket it would be a fringe thing. No Fortune 500s accepting it. Coinbase, Varum, Bitpay, Circle, Xapo, etc. would be non-existent or be a couple of orders of magnitude smaller than they are.

Do you think they are bloated? I think the AMZN news is bigger because it is a revenue model unique to bitcoin and I think the AAPL news is huge (assuming it means apps will be in the store) because a lot of people who matter a lot can't try bitcoin on their iPhone.
The Dish news is good don't get me wrong, but doesn't show the potential of bitcoin like AMZN or help bring it to millions of people like APPL may.

@_date: 2015-01-14 17:45:25
I don't think the block reward is a cost on participants. It is an incentive to bootstrap the network until it is self sustaining.
It's better to think of it as network participants rewarding the miners for running the network by granting them blocks in my mind. Without network participants mining is worthless. Without miners the network doesn't run. They are both necessary but participants more so than miners.

Are the open listings unfunded loans?
It makes sense the unfunded loans have dropped with the auto invest feature.
Maybe that will also bring down interest rates (over-supply of lenders?)
@_date: 2015-01-14 17:41:30
I don't think so. The cost for running the network is different from the cost of using the network in my mind.
For example if Visa paid 1Billion to run their network vs. $1 to run their network last year is a separate issue from what they charge customers to use the network. 
Visa could for a long while run their network at a loss just like GM sold cars for over a decade at a loss. Miners can choose to run the network unprofitably, but they are incentivized to run it at a profit or not run it.
@_date: 2014-06-16 22:25:39
Disagree. Mining incentives are busted and should be fixed. It's like saying WalMart is screwing everyone while ignoring their massive customer base and the legal system they operate in.

Here's an example of a company that made a $400 million mistake deploying what was probably a well tested change: 
@_date: 2015-01-10 05:37:33
I've worked on large IT systems for Fortune 500 companies. Those types of systems can't go down and can't have production bugs or the customer could lose lots of money. It is even more critical for an exchange like Bitstamp to ensure their system doesn't have bugs. One bug or security flaw could bankrupt their company.
Every change that is made is a potential liability. Changing that much at once is putting a lot of risk into the system. Typically that risk would be mitigated by extensive testing. Again one bug or security flaw could bankrupt their company.
A five day implementation time for changes of the magnitude described on a system where a bug or security flaw could bankrupt the company is **shockingly** fast. Hence my question.

@_date: 2015-01-30 16:01:07
You are right. That is the basis for my conclusion.
@_date: 2015-01-14 22:47:22
why won't it ever be self sustaining?
Visa handles an average of 2K transactions per second. At 1/10 of a cent per transaction that is $1,200 / ten minutes (about a block) at a cent per transaction that is $12K.
As far as I know there was still mining when block rewards were less than 12K / block (when he price was sub $475 over the past year) so that suggests to me Bitcoin can be self sustaining especially if it gets as large as Visa (300 million to 500 million customers I believe)

I read the blog first. The auction ensures I won't be buying at a high or low point?
Then I went looking for who would want to use it. It seems like it is a way for me to avoid buying at a specific time during the day and wondering if that is a 'good' price. 
I had questions around - does it work the way I think it works? Starting off with a use case would be helpful - here is why someone would want to use the auction - OK here is how it works.
And does it matter on volume - like if I'm trading $5 or $5000 does it impact if I should choose auction or not.

You are right. I don't see estimated next to the fill time. Looking on their site right now I **still** don't see the word estimated [pic]( If they did have estimate in the UX that would be an improvement. Even better would be a realistic range like (2-30 days).
There is a particular product that I'd like to get a lot of at the maximum discount possible. Based on their info I'm not sure if it will ever be filled despite the fact that they say 48 hours. My previous attempt at filling a more expensive version of this product lasted for around 4 months and resulted in no fill, despite the fact that their website estimated it would be filled in 3-5 days.
Even if it did say *Estimated* the current estimates are off by 2 days on a 2 day estimate.
I have a feeling my order will not be filled in 2 weeks at the current 25% discount.
Like I said in my tweet. If they don't know just don't say anything.

You are right about the setup not being onerous and I didn't use the payments, but it looked easy.

From a 'UX is solved' perspective I don't think syncing on open works. I get annoyed when I put in my credit card at a card reader and it takes 5 - 10 seconds to confirm payment.

2. Add it to a new Amazon wishlist (I've tried reusing wishlists, it doesn't work) also ensure the list is public and uncheck spoil my surprises.
3. Copy and past the Amazon wishlist URL into purse 
4. Wait patiently for your order to be filled (if it takes too long lower the discount)
I have the purse steps listed as part of a [longer article on buying gold profitably with bitcoin](

I wrote something similar in [my rebutta]( to a Hacker News post.

that video is awesome, who did it?

I think the [Gemini Exchange]( is the best option.
It will probably take you 2-3 days for your deposit to clear and then you can place a limit order for 50K.
Here is a link explaining how to [buy bitcoin on an exchange](
Another option is to buy [GBTC]( through your brokerage account. This will be particularly easy if you already have money in an account.  Do be aware that one share of GBTC represents 1/10 of a bitcoin.

Namecheap supports bitcoin so I have been supporting them with all my domain registration business since 2013 and plan on supporting them forever more.
@_date: 2015-10-24 20:11:07
Yeah it is heavy.
The idea is the current system has corruption / fraud and that bitcoin can reduce the fraud by giving bitcoin directly to those in need (the less hands that handle funds the less opportunity for theft)




@_date: 2015-10-24 22:10:10
It says they have cell phones and bitcoin works on feature phones and smart phones.
@_date: 2015-10-29 23:26:03
Good call. I have an article + video where I show how [I buy 90 shares of GBTC for my roth IRA.](

Thanks for updating us! Looking forward to hearing more on the topic.
@_date: 2015-10-06 17:29:44
working on anything else at the moment?
@_date: 2015-10-19 12:12:53
Yeah! I'd love to follow the story!

Dollar balances are eligible for FDIC insurance and they seem to be insured.


@_date: 2015-03-07 13:19:51
Yup thats how I got mine!

I don't think the article will last on Wikipedia


A great place to house the content (already started) is the [Bitcoin Wiki Getting Started](
Disclaimer I wrote most of that article.
@_date: 2015-10-17 14:53:49
Yes I did. Not cool?
What is AA?
@_date: 2015-10-31 11:41:31
I think it is here because secp256k1 is used in bitcoin.


I'm guessing having it in that library will make it easier for people to write bitcoin apps. Security isn't my strong suite though, so I could be wrong.
@_date: 2015-10-15 01:42:08
Thanks for the instructions, that was hard to find.
I wonder when they added it. I already had a bitcoin address in there. I think it must have been in 2014 or 2013 since I don't remember...
@_date: 2015-10-24 22:11:41
They didn't get to that level of detail in the article, but probably something like that...

Thanks for posting, I tried OB about a year ago and I'm excited to try your product (just signed up for the mailing list)

I'm trying to help with that. I'm expecting my first bitwage deposit this week :)

What I'm really wondering is what markup (%) and order size (bitcoins) you are getting filled at. Care to share?
@_date: 2016-05-19 00:50:57


Same with me!

@_date: 2015-10-09 20:05:32
Thanks! It was hard to get everything. I hope I didn't miss any spots :)

I already have an account, I couldn't figure out how to get the credit.
@_date: 2015-02-15 13:07:40
I don't know if they can or not. That is the only non-credit union bank I have and I thought I'd list it since you said bigger banks have more buyers.
@_date: 2015-10-17 14:54:03
Oh I got it, Andreas :)
@_date: 2015-02-11 05:54:19
Sorry I marked it as spam and deleted it. It seems to be gone forever.

I've got that drawing hanging in my living room.
I was just looking at it yesterday and thinking about how much I like it :)
@_date: 2015-02-11 05:19:44
It is pretty bad, with the non-coinbase address on there.
@_date: 2015-02-14 07:14:28
what do you sell at on there? I put in a sell for .1 bitcoin at +7% a couple days ago. No fill on it. How much are you selling and at what markup?
@_date: 2015-02-11 05:17:39
I was hoping to get scammed and give away my bitcoins :p
I like trying out new bitcoin services, tired, didn't look before leaping, and most (all?) coinbase scams I've gotten emailed about are changes to terms of service.
@_date: 2015-02-15 00:45:51
I've got a credit union and Capital one 360. What have you been filled at in the past or what would you recommend I post at?
I used to get filled at localbitcoins at +10% in 2013.
@_date: 2015-02-11 04:56:54
I clicked my first bitcoin phishing link today. At least I think that's what it was. The link didn't go to Coinbase and I left post haste.
@_date: 2015-02-15 15:15:12
sarcasm detector broken?
@_date: 2015-10-17 15:03:34
good point.
@_date: 2015-02-11 04:58:20
Thanks for the reminder.
@_date: 2015-11-03 00:33:08
Great, I'm glad I could help.
Yes, I have 90 shares of GBTC.
@_date: 2015-02-10 23:36:08
Yup I've gotten bit by this online and in real life. Super frustrating. Like you said I never use them if I care about the transaction being broadcast immediately. When that doesn't happen transactions don't get confirmed. It's like saying 'checks in the mail'
Edit thanks to goalkeeperr for the reminder on my terminology.
I also submitted two support tickets to Coinbase in the past on this issue. Shocking the issue persists since it can be such an awful experience.
@_date: 2016-07-26 10:43:33
I've been investing in Magnr since January 2016. They pay 2% interest on BTC savings accounts.
@_date: 2015-02-05 16:45:38
Yup Same thing. I thought maybe a direct link would do better.
Any feedback on why it was downvoted so much?
@_date: 2015-02-28 12:55:14
if reddit was the first notification Blockchain got of this issue that is scary
@_date: 2015-02-11 06:14:18
I went through my browser history and found where the link went. I forwarded that to support
Hope it helps.
