Whose to say this isnt stable? Perhaps bitcoin will continue to grow this fast?

I second this. Excellent website. Just setup a debit/credit card through googlecheckout and then setup verification on the website (almost instant) and purchase as many coins as you'd like. Small markup of 7.5%. So easy. So worth it.

try btcquick.com there's a 7.5% markup but the verification is close to instant and you can use google checkout. highly recommended.

Btcquick.com is the best website to get bitcoin immediately. 7.5% markup, but its worth it cause you can use your credit card. Excellent customer service too!

I'm afraid so...

btcquick.com is a website I've used. Highly recommend it- you can buy bitcoins using google checkout (credit cards essentially). I spoke with the CEO for about a half hour yesterday and he seems like a really good guy. Markup is 7.5% though (still smallest markup for any credit card bitcoin exchange)

I'm confused- can I still perform transactions on coinbase.com?
