As well as occasional dessert coffees.

I agree. He should focus on the dessert-coffee business, and leave Bitcoin alone.

A serious question: Of the $40k you've invested, how much can you afford to lose?

Do you think a fabricated large-scale scandal would destroy bitcoin by persuading retailers to stop accepting it as payment?  
@_date: 2013-12-24 04:56:54
Thanks, very helpful. Which online accounts do you recommend for longterm storage? And do they accept all digital currencies?
@_date: 2013-12-24 05:14:10
Thanks for clarification.

Do you think such regulations would be in the government's interest? Is Bitcoin a big threat to them?
@_date: 2013-12-24 18:44:43
I'd like to think cryptocurrencies can exist outside political influence, but who knows what kinds of problems would arise from, let's say, heavy taxes levied against US-based companies that accept bitcoins as payment.

I know, what's going on with that spambot?
@_date: 2013-12-24 18:46:38
Can you elaborate?
@_date: 2013-12-24 04:37:37
How easy is it to buy bitcoins -- and other digital currencies such as Dogecoin, Peercoin, etc -- at market price on Coinbase? Given the market's volatility, do sellers ever sell lower than current market value?
@_date: 2013-12-24 04:42:26
Ok great -- they don't need to confirm banking info to set up wallet? I didn't know it's an automatic process.
@_date: 2013-12-24 04:33:34
I've heard good things about that site. If I buy one from there, how would I store it? Sorry for the beginner's question.
@_date: 2013-12-24 04:31:16
Thanks for any advice. I want to get into cryptocurrencies, but from what I've read, establishing a wallet on Coinbase can take 3-4 days. 
@_date: 2013-12-24 05:11:55
I understand where you're coming from. But don't you think the coin's active community will give it staying power? 
@_date: 2013-12-24 04:41:20
Thanks for links. Is it common for localbitcoins sellers to be significantly higher than current market value?
@_date: 2013-12-24 04:48:10
Makes sense. On Coinbase is it easy to find the coins at market value?

@_date: 2013-12-24 04:58:57
Ooh...are you saying it takes 30 days to be able to establish a purchase order on Coinbase? Otherwise I have to scan the offers?
@_date: 2013-12-24 04:39:52
I've heard storing on Coinbase can be dangerous. Do you recommend pulling bitcoins off the web, and keeping them on memory sticks? Thanks for the tips -- all this is new for me.
