"Low levels of compliance." Music to my ears!

Hardware wallets will come down in price as more competitors enter the market and figure out more efficient ways to produce. Trezor was the first company to release a hardware wallet, and $120 is the price of the first generation of its products.
Remember how spendy DVD and mP3 players used to be?

I agree. As the entire point of Bitcoin is the non-need for identity, I think that attempts to tie addresses to real-world identities is counterproductive.

Agreed with other commenters that the "call for regulation" demonstrates a complete misunderstanding of Bitcoin's self-regulating system of mathematics.
Not to mention that simple supply and demand (i.e. prices), which existed long before Bitcoin, are the strictest and fairest regulators of all.
Bitcoin's got it all--price regulation AND algorithmic regulation. These people are committed to centralization, and we don't need them.

Hey, author here. Thanks for posting. I couldn't believe that part about the state in Italy forcibly preventing people from paying rent in cash. They print it up, but they don't want you to use it! Death to fiat.

I'd perhaps use familiar Bitcoin imagery--orange and yellow versus the blue you've chosen. A Bitcoin "B" or familiar logo up top.

Thanks for the share! Will check out your whitepaper and maybe download. Been looking for an open-source alternative to 
Gliph. Down with closed-source and the trust model!

Lobbying is the antithesis of freedom.

Yes. This article describes the three most popular sites. Two require accounts (which can be pseudonymous) and one doesn't:

I have wondered about this many times. I write for CoinTelegraph, and I'll post an article that I think is super-exciting about Bitcoin, and it will get maybe two upvotes, one of them being mine. I'll search for the post, and frequently it doesn't even appear on any pages--I can only find it through a keyword search.
Or maybe I'm just a shit writer? Either way, I'm frequently surprised by the voting tally round these parts.

Sorry to hear about your loss. I think I'll write about your experience on CoinTelegraph to prevent this from happening to someone else. Again, sorry to hear about this and thanks for sharing.

Summary, quotes and further info about yesterday's wildly popular Reddit post:  
(I know I should make that a hyperlink rather than a long ugly URL, but I don't know how. If you do, I'd appreciate instruction!)

Ah! [Thanks](

Agreed. I stopped using and promoting Coinbase for this very reason. Now when people ask how they might take payments, I recommend Coinify or EasyBitz. And for buying, I recommend Wall of Coins.

Welcome! :)

My personal favorite was when the rep from TKB Trasta Komercbanka said that regulated industries are seeing lots of people losing money, hence Bitcoin should be regulated too.

Hey, thanks!

What app do you use to run a full Bitcoin node on your phone? I'd be very interested to know, and would amend the article.
