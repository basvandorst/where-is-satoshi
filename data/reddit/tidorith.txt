The geological continent of Austalia is  not limited to just the nation of Australia either though; it includes Papa New Guinea, East Timor, and some parts of Indonesia.

If you're playing with the standard rules, you should never actually need this rule. The Free Parking rule, some equivalent, or intentionally playing badly is almost necessary to run out of bank money.

I know, but my question is, why is this relevant? The growth of the cannabis market never has the potential of reaching the amount of USD in circulation because cannabis just isn't that useful at a fundamental level - so the fact that there isn't *that* much money spent on cannabis is not evidence that the growth of the market is limited by its illegality.

Every country has their own little quirks at least. Germany's generally pretty good, the only issues I have with them are that their current economic strength is due in some part to the weakness of some of its neighbours, and also their anti-nuclear stance. I'm all for renewables replacing nuclear power, but reducing nuclear power while people are still using fossil fuels is not environmentally wise.

Obviously, because no one's trying to use cannabis as currency.

By the number of *potential* users. There are only so many people who would ever want to smoke  cannabis, regardless of its legality. In order to see how much the legal status of cannabis effects its proliferation, you need to compare the current users to a world where its legal status was different. It's not enough to say that "not everyone uses it, therefore it being banned has stopped its growth". Banning things can in theory *increase* interest in something - not that I'm saying this is the case for cannabis.

Depends on the kind of renewable. Hydro is quickly adjustable, you just close some gates and don't let any more water through, or open extra ones. Obviously it suffers from geographical availability problems, but in cases where it can be used it's a much better option than gas plants. Pretty sure tidal power, if and when it becomes available, would be able to be locked down in a similar fashion.

Something something about the irony of commenting on intelligence and conflating spelling ability with intelligence.
