Lightning payments are centralized though...

Yes, it's the same all around the world with all digital assets.

"fairly low limit" I think their limit is high enough for most users actually
@_date: 2018-10-21 18:24:36
Is this a joke or

Exchange's support is an underrated aspect, but I'm glad to be using Kraken atm and imo it's one of the most professional exchanges out there

Yes, but can't say I don't understand the reasoning behind his/hers argument BUT I know in my country the banking system used to be similar (with a bank account being linked to a number and not a person) and that still counted as property.

They don't compete, completely different use cases. Bitcoin is essentially anti banks while xrp is pro banks.

Man why you putting cardano in the same bracket as electroneum :(

Why the fuck are you comparing shanghai and shenzhen
@_date: 2019-04-16 22:57:50
Why? Lots of people use it to transfer money between exchanges
@_date: 2019-04-17 07:49:15
Doesn't mean people aren't using it
@_date: 2019-04-17 08:04:28
Fair enough, I don't know much about Blockstream so at first glance this was just another wallet being released
@_date: 2019-04-04 22:25:09
This did NOT age well
@_date: 2019-04-17 08:01:46
I was just wondering, nothing negative, but I still don't see what's THAT special with this wallet
@_date: 2018-11-04 23:26:57
"every new coin" 
I hope you know there are several projects out there with a following due to the tech and not price hype

Was about to recomend other dexes but this one is open source and peer 2 peer, can't really beat that
@_date: 2018-07-24 18:18:02
Well tbh Dash was quite promising a year ago
@_date: 2019-05-18 23:23:18
Read the whitepaper? It literally says BTC's goal is a peer to peer cash system, this has nothing to do with BCH
@_date: 2018-12-02 10:34:39
We can dream
@_date: 2019-05-20 21:53:43
Are you anti vax or something
@_date: 2018-12-20 13:38:20
Yes, it's the thing holding it back the most. The tribalism is insane within that community
