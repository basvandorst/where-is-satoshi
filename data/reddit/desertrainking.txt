That's a good idea!
@_date: 2015-06-27 11:56:28
Ah, I'll have to look at this. It seems lovely!
@_date: 2015-06-27 13:36:42
I like the coinmixing, encrypted lobbies, and stealth addresses.
@_date: 2015-06-24 11:30:01
maybe you should first upgrade the Darkwallet 0.3.1 to Darkwallet 0.8.0. . . I think they redid the stealth address system in between those versions.
@_date: 2015-12-30 16:28:02
Good for them! Finally someone has backbone! :-)
@_date: 2015-06-27 15:40:22
Yes me too!
@_date: 2015-12-30 16:28:55
Hehe true true.
@_date: 2015-12-30 16:28:34
No one really does. . . except the you-know-who.
@_date: 2015-06-27 13:35:55
I would agree
@_date: 2015-06-27 13:38:01
It would be nice if there was a more user-friendly version of this.
@_date: 2016-01-01 03:45:02
Pretty interesting discussion.
@_date: 2016-01-01 03:46:08
I don't think Jeff Garzik or Gavin Andresen are interested in signing. They've shown much more interest in other implementations.
@_date: 2015-03-11 09:29:25
the key can be exported (or if the seed is used it can be recovered, I believe)
@_date: 2015-03-11 09:16:11
Something is the matter with the gateway. I can't connect either. Maybe one of the developers can pipe in and let us know what is happening?
@_date: 2015-03-10 13:40:30
Is there an Egyptian exchange? I'm not sure there is. . . if there was you could easily demonstrate how they would use it.
@_date: 2015-03-03 15:27:42
I use it for spending my paper wallets and also for keeping a bit of bitcoin on my phone for small purchases around town.
@_date: 2015-03-07 14:58:44
Yes it should be reported. . . 
@_date: 2015-03-10 09:10:15
And for some reason this use-case of bitcoin is very rarely talked about it seems. . . 
@_date: 2015-03-03 12:47:54
Blockchain.info is really good but you can use Dark Wallet as well. It's only in alpha 8 but it's usable. I have money in the high three digits in there in different pockets.
@_date: 2015-03-10 09:17:04
Pretty cool! The amount of new technology being built and can be built on bitcoin is pretty amazing. . . multi-signature, hd wallets. . . now sidechains!
@_date: 2015-03-10 13:38:13
wow pretty amazing!
@_date: 2015-03-03 12:48:22
That's good advice if you're not going to spend it.
@_date: 2015-03-11 16:05:04
I deleted my history (planning to rescan it). . . so I don't know which addresses have which coins :(
@_date: 2015-03-07 14:48:17
Oh, that's good to know! Sometimes it seemed like there was no  one in the Trollbox.
@_date: 2015-03-08 18:34:16
It is not complete.
@_date: 2015-03-12 09:00:09
I agree -- I watched it a couple months ago and have been sharing it with all my friends and family.
@_date: 2015-03-12 23:50:14
 How long will he be there for?
@_date: 2015-03-13 04:52:56
Good luck!! :-)
@_date: 2015-03-03 20:06:07
Is 12 or 13 words enough?
@_date: 2015-03-01 17:33:21
With Dark Wallet you can make Watch only wallets (by making your paper wallets contacts in your address book). This works very well for me -- I have all my paper wallets listed there as well as my sister and brother's paper wallets (I'm taking care of their bitcoins.)
@_date: 2015-03-03 20:00:25
He should have kept his money in bitcoin. And anyone else who wants to keep at least a portion of his wealth away from government gropings.
@_date: 2015-03-11 17:40:15
If i put the seed in electrum would that work as well?
@_date: 2015-11-28 02:43:15
Please do!!
@_date: 2015-03-08 21:15:04
Is this like shape shifter?
@_date: 2015-03-06 18:46:35
What if you use the Coinbase exchange? Do they still penalize you for selling to LocalBitcoins?
@_date: 2015-03-07 14:43:35
Yes mixing has been really hit and miss for me. . . hopefully that will be smoothed out in the next few weeks.
@_date: 2015-03-12 05:32:58
Never reuse addresses and this should not be a problem.
@_date: 2015-03-02 20:07:00
@_date: 2015-03-07 15:24:58
I think probably Dark Wallet and Signal/Redphone/Text Secure from Open Whisper systems. . you probably have the best state-of-the-art tools for anonymity and privacy in communications. . . Can't wait to see what happens as they continue to develop!
@_date: 2015-03-13 05:37:29
They should switch to bitcoin and advertise how users can buy bitcoin easily through other companies/exchanges.
@_date: 2015-03-13 13:44:53
Hopefully we can get zerocash-privacy features into bitcoin soon while it is still young.
@_date: 2015-02-11 07:09:26
What about Gulf countries? There are loads of 3rd world workers in Gulf countries that need an easy way to send money back home.
@_date: 2015-03-02 17:02:13
So what is LibertyX going to be doing in the future?
@_date: 2015-03-11 21:38:42
Ah! Got to read it again! Loved that triology
@_date: 2015-03-09 03:52:41


Oh! I think you sent it directly to them instead of using the Lighthouse program :(
@_date: 2015-03-11 17:41:43
Yahoo! We're finally online :-)
@_date: 2015-02-18 11:04:41
Competition maybe? But they shouldn't worry about where you get your bitcoins, I agree.
@_date: 2015-02-14 18:13:54
Both those are good. I'm curious how truecoin works because it seems it has also become a popular onramp.
@_date: 2015-02-28 12:28:37
@_date: 2015-02-27 09:30:47
I have history and you can see in the screenshot that they think they gave a 15% discount. But they didn't :(
@_date: 2015-02-13 07:32:57
I agree it doesn't matter at all but lots of friends don't want to buy when it goes up because they don't like the idea of buying part of a bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-02-21 21:00:51
also Truecoin
@_date: 2015-02-26 09:39:02
Wow very nice! I might actually get some gold that way in the next few months with bitcoin. :-)
@_date: 2015-02-14 18:11:47
Nice rundown of the news!
@_date: 2015-02-17 01:17:29
Local Bitcoins works pretty well.
@_date: 2015-02-24 23:57:24
Cool. Now they got to make it easier to use on Facebook.
@_date: 2015-02-27 08:34:24
A recording costing 53.61 on Amazon cost me 49.79 -- it seems they have misapplied a 8% discount filter instead of the 15% discount filter they promised :( 
@_date: 2015-02-22 06:57:48
What do you mean 'after the first period'?
@_date: 2015-02-23 19:20:43
Hmm. . . Will people realize how cool bitcoin is with apple pay?
@_date: 2015-02-28 12:22:56
I've been around longer but I get new accounts every so often because of privacy concerns.
@_date: 2015-02-12 19:35:38
When will people from other countries be able to use the coinbase exchange?
@_date: 2015-02-12 19:15:43
@_date: 2015-02-27 10:30:45
15% 
@_date: 2015-02-20 16:41:07
Cool you are on reddit and so responsive
@_date: 2015-02-28 07:49:05
This is not any kind of fake news discussion site, but this has relevance to bitcoin. Do we want the FCC to take charge of Bitcoin next to make it fairer? Why can't the internet just be left alone?
@_date: 2015-02-15 14:44:14
Wow pretty impressive!
@_date: 2015-02-19 15:21:59
May a thousand flowers blossom!
@_date: 2015-02-11 12:32:32
That would be a terrible idea :(
@_date: 2015-02-15 15:05:27
Hopefully it will force exchanges to keep their bitcoin more securely.
@_date: 2015-02-27 06:42:43
So does this mean the paid version of Mega will only be available with bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-02-28 08:17:07
Have tourists and locals download a local wallet on their iphones/androids. . and then provide exchanges and places were you can buy bitcoin over the counter. . . and get most of the shops to accept bitcoin.
You won't have a physical note but you will probably give them incentive to spend the money in your area because there aren't that many ways to spend bitcoin in brick-and-mortar shops outside of your area yet.
@_date: 2015-03-06 14:13:16
Get an account with Korbit. . and transfer your money to Korbit (there's an English version of the site). Then send the money to Circle/Coinbase if you are in the states and sell it there. I have a friend in South Korea who does it pretty regularly and that's what he does.
@_date: 2015-02-11 16:35:41
So does this mean the correct value of bitcoin at the moment would be around 500$?
@_date: 2015-02-14 18:33:33
Welcome from Sweden! You might be able to use circle - it seems sometimes to work for non-American credit cards.
@_date: 2015-02-25 04:43:47
definitely both Circle and Bitpay should use bits. . . that for starters would make it a lot more intuitive and easier to use for newcomers
@_date: 2015-02-25 08:47:11
Perhaps they should use Stripe
@_date: 2015-02-12 07:00:10
So when will the airlines actually accept bitcoin payments?
@_date: 2015-02-26 19:46:52
It matters because there is more things you can do with higher-valued currency (because of the larger liquidity and so-called 'market cap').
@_date: 2015-02-28 17:01:36
I agree!
@_date: 2015-02-11 06:01:52
I haven't been able to get ChangeTip to work with facebook :( Has anyone been able to and are there any tips to get it working?
@_date: 2015-02-28 07:52:32
What is my misunderstanding?
@_date: 2015-02-19 17:10:46
Now hopefully the Coinbase exchange opens up to UK and Canada!
@_date: 2015-02-11 15:46:29
It would be great if they started giving Bitstamp a run for their money in Europe. :-)
@_date: 2015-02-26 09:38:10
I use bitcoin for remittances from a third-world country (not Thailand or China) to the States and have found that I can often gain some money (ranging from a few cents to 20-60 dollars) in the remittance. I buy at the local exchange which is connected to my bank account and then sell at Coinbase or Circle.
It's very fast and can be done at any time of day or night (although I usually try to time it so that I don't loose any money because of how the relative exchange rates work out). 
@_date: 2015-02-18 19:57:14
that's not very nice :(
@_date: 2015-02-14 18:11:23
Coursera has a signature track that I would love to pay with bitcoin for. Maybe we can try to set up a petition or what not that they'd start accepting bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-02-24 23:58:47
I, Pencil! :-)
@_date: 2015-02-14 18:09:45
Maybe all my friends have strict privacy settings? I can't get any friend at all to show up even though the Facebook is linked.
@_date: 2015-02-28 06:48:38
Oh wow that's good to know. I tried using the earlier versions and they didn't work very well. I'll download the latest one and try then.
Does the coinjoin system work as well?
@_date: 2015-02-15 15:03:11
How can bitcoin get stolen from a cold wallet??
@_date: 2015-02-20 05:08:11
Blockchain.info has pretty awesome wallets as well (that you remain in control of)
@_date: 2015-02-28 07:53:58
So I guess that's why they now allow incoming wires :-)
@_date: 2015-02-18 06:03:30
for USD, not when competing with the Chinese exchanges
@_date: 2015-03-07 14:33:08
Dark Wallet communication system is pretty cool. . . you can have cloaks for talking to random people. . . but have persistent and verifiable identities for the people who you want to stay in contact with. 
@_date: 2015-02-16 12:06:15
Purchases through circle are instant and they do not show up as cash advances. They show up as normal purchases.
I'm not affiliated with Circle, but that has been my experience so far.
I'd look up TrueCoin as well. It seems they offer instant 1000$ purchase of bitcoin in 30 US states.
@_date: 2015-02-21 21:27:09
Really?! That would be so amazing if true. We've been hearing it's just around the corner for ages now though.
@_date: 2015-02-27 04:48:46
This is quite common on Fridays. . and then it goes down again on Sundays :-) At least it has the last few weeks.
@_date: 2015-02-14 21:29:57
@_date: 2015-02-14 10:21:10
Do you write a comment on their wall and then put  Because I did that for some of my friends and nothing happened.
@_date: 2015-03-08 14:11:27
Yes. I'd also like them to add google authenticator support. . . 
@_date: 2015-02-28 08:02:03
Haha I'm not worried or concerned about whose baby it is. . . it could be Satan's baby for all I care. . . I worry about the points he is making not who is making the points.
@_date: 2015-02-13 07:32:24
You can in coinbase but not on the exchange I think :(
@_date: 2015-02-19 15:18:20
Ok, cool. I'll donate! :-)
@_date: 2015-02-17 16:14:30
Coinbase is only 26 states versus the whole world though. And it's hard to get traders in the beginning.
@_date: 2015-02-11 14:31:38
Wow thank you Circle!
@_date: 2015-02-22 04:21:35
Because it says, don't use it with real money just the testnet
@_date: 2015-02-13 13:25:31
@_date: 2015-02-22 06:03:00


How does that work?
@_date: 2015-02-16 15:49:43
oh interesting! good to know!
@_date: 2015-02-27 10:15:41
Why does cash get more of a discount?
@_date: 2015-02-21 19:14:50
On a slightly different note, could Coinbase provide a way for us to upload our pgp public keys so all the communication we get from coinbase gets encrypted? And is pgp signed by coinbase as well?
@_date: 2015-02-14 12:31:44
I would love to use a version of Mycelium on my iphone. Is there any apple version in development?
@_date: 2015-02-23 19:14:58
Yeah mine too! kk
@_date: 2015-02-17 16:14:00
Good point. I wonder how long it will take to surpass bitfinex (or if they'll be able to do so at all). I do feel that Coinbase is a gamechanger though and with Gemini should really push a lot of bitcoin adoption in the US.
@_date: 2015-02-28 19:40:53
What country are you from?
@_date: 2015-02-18 08:48:54
I wonder if you can do wash trading in Coinbase because the identification requirements are pretty strict.
@_date: 2015-02-27 05:09:58
The Bitcoin Foundation also submitted a Freedom of Information request and hasn't got anything either. :(
@_date: 2015-02-18 07:11:36
I'm not sure that really effects the volume. . and they are only serving 26 states (with no signs of increasing that number fast as far as we've seen so far).
@_date: 2015-02-24 12:42:16
Very cool!
@_date: 2015-02-12 19:04:26
I think they should disappear the fee though if they do acquire it. It doesn't make sense that moving money from your 'tip wallet' to your normal wallet would cost money.
@_date: 2015-02-28 07:44:13
Local Bitcoins works pretty well. . sometimes there isn't much of a premium you have to pay.
@_date: 2015-02-19 15:25:30
Could you explain?
@_date: 2015-02-19 15:55:38
Cool. That's what I thought but I wanted a second opinion. :-)
@_date: 2015-02-19 17:04:56
Keychain will be even more confusing for the masses, imho. How can you keep money in a keychain? k
@_date: 2015-02-25 08:05:28
Serious competition to give them a run for their money is a better idea.
@_date: 2015-02-24 11:36:36
We really need to get bigger blocks so we can have smaller fees.
@_date: 2015-02-19 04:35:32
Hopefully some companies will take them up on it
@_date: 2015-02-19 17:07:13
Oh cool! That is a relief to hear!
@_date: 2015-02-18 04:57:36
I think they tend to cause trouble when you buy bitcoins in Circle.
@_date: 2015-02-18 08:46:54
That's pretty bad. I didn't have to do a selfie either. Hopefully we can get a lot of money onramped into bitcoin and most of us in the future can just earn bitcoin instead of having trying to buy it with fiat.
@_date: 2015-02-27 09:57:31
Yes but if I payed at that rate I would have payed a lot more than the article was priced on Amazon. The rate is fine. . how much I had to pay is not.
@_date: 2015-02-19 14:28:58
Will all the addresses only be visible in a dialog box like in the demo?
@_date: 2015-02-25 08:04:02
Wow. . . it's hard to imagine someone who holds bitcoin and is a big "bitcoin believer", but nevertheless wants to take away bitcoin options.
