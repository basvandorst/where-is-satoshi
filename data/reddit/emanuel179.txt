Noob question here. Pls no roasting. I’m wondering if there’s a way somehow to make bitcoins look better as a currency, e.g. Like if it was 1 iPhone for 300 bitcoins it would look neater, and I wouldn’t have to put so many 0.00s in coinbase to make regular payments, as one bitcoin is worth so much. I’m sure there’s 10000 reasons they can’t do this but I’ll ask anyway out of curiosity.

Interesting. So, what is it you ‘use’ for long term investments?

So sell at a loss instead?

But when you buy , and it simply goes down? You shouldn’t panic and sell, making a loss. They’re saying the better idea is to hold, and wait for it to go back up.

Well i also buy a lot with it, so I find it useful to have in my wallet. I don’t care about making money with the price raising, I just wish it would stabilise :)

I take payments in it. :)

I don’t want an asset - I want a currency. A crypto-currency. If I can’t use it as that, in my opinion it doesn’t have much value as an asset.

Yikes, I do but I don’t feel proud about it right now haha

I understand that, however I’d hope for a currency not to half in value overnight. When it hovered around 6K all was perfect :/
