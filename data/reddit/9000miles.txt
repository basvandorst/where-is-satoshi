That doesn't solve the larger problem though. The average joe isn't going to go through all that to buy bitcoin. If this currency is to grow and expand its userbase as people want it to, the process of buying has to become much, much easier. People need to be able to do it on their laptops or phones without too much hassle.

This is the biggest problem with buying Bitcoin, and nobody - not a single person - has ever given me a solid answer to why I shouldn't be terrified about giving my personal info to all these organizations.
As someone said below, you can quickly register and buy with Coinbase if you connect a bank account or use credit card rather than debit. 
But your larger point stands. Bitcoin and crypto exchanges in general have huge security risks that nobody seems to want to acknowledge. I don't give my social security number to most companies unless absolutely required. I'm certainly not giving it to some little-known crypto exchange run by god knows who, located in god knows where.

No. Nobody in the Bitcoin community can ever ELI5 anything. Even when they try, it's more like an ELI20. Bitcoin is never going to reach its full level of mass adoption by the general public until someone successfully fills this role.

The biggest problem with Bitcoin is that nobody can ELI5 anything, no matter how many times you ask. I have all the same questions and concerns as you. I've been reading and learning for a while and am still struggling to figure out wallets and security.
Maybe someday, somebody, somewhere will create a version of a Bitcoin Wiki that doesn't require advanced technological knowledge to understand. Or even just a niche website dedicated to crypto for newbies. I don't know why someone hasn't jumped on that yet.

Newbie here, can anyone ease my fears about providing my social security number to Gemini? Seems like a big security risk in the event of an eventual data breach.

It wasn't required for Coinbase though.

Coinbase did not require this. Nor did Bitcoin of America or Poloniex.

Which of these do not require the user's social security number? I am done with Coinbase but haven't found a good alternative yet. Gemini wanted my SS which is a deal breaker. Bitcoin of America had insane markups (current price was 2200, they were trying to charge me 2400 to buy.) Poloniex wouldn't let me sign up because I'm American but currently traveling abroad, so they kept giving me a country verification error.
