That's cool! I would try to laminate the one I made, but I don't think I could bend it properly. It's designed to be folded in half lengthways, and in thirds left to right so that it's like a little tri-fold. The private QR and code is in the center, out of sight. You have to open it up all the way to get to that. And it fits inside a credit card sleeve so I can keep it in my (physical, heh) wallet. Of course, I only carry it when I need to move, buy, or use coins.

Wait, what do you mean that bitcoin doesn't need to be assayed? The retailer who has that widget I want prices it in dollars. So I need to convert a specific amount of bitcoin into dollars. In order to know how much bitcoin to exchange, I need to know what the value of bitcoin is to dollars. Isn't this exactly the same as if I wanted to buy the widget with gold?

Ahh, I see. So then it's down to the different physical layout styles of the printed item then. I'm working on getting them sized more specifically to fit neatly into a credit card pouch. This would give them greater durability, and make it easier to store in standard wallets.

I'm just wondering if the average bandwidth use would disrupt my plex server (different machine) or my main gaming rig (also a different machine). My intention would be to build a Raspberry Pi to do this. I have 10mb/s by 10mb/s fiber, and I can't imagine it would be bad enough.... but that's why I asked.
@_date: 2017-03-13 12:02:20
Wow. That's just..... stupid. Then again, it's government, so why not?
@_date: 2017-03-12 02:19:36
That's a cool setup but I don't see how to put a custom background on it, and there is just the one cutout/design. The templates I put out can be done in any editor that lets you paste into them (something like Gimp) as a layer. You can them put your own QR and long form code and print. No browser needed, no messing around with the printer or anything. And I'm liking the two sided, trifold effect too.

WHats the rationale though? In order to convert bitcoin into a gallon of gas, or food, or whatever, it has to be converted to whatever currency is in use where you are. I've been having trouble wrapping my head around bitcoin being an actual currency. I can't help but view it as gold. You can't buy stuff with gold either. So how does a larger debt make having bitcoin more useful?

what sort of bandwidth does a node use per sec on average? Per day/month?

I am hoping that the people behind the scene are working feverishly to spread BTC accessibility to more retail businesses. It can only be good for people to start to see options to use bitcoin in places like grocery stores.

And you didn't get my point. Guess what? Bitcoin will be used for completely evil things too, by governments, corporation, and individual people. It's not about the currency. It's about the humanity. This is not to say that your point is invalid so to speak. It's that your ire is misplaced. Money=power. Power leads to abuse. It's hardwired into our species. Luckily it seems as though a majority of the world's population choose not to be evil. But it doesn't take many to ruin everything (as they have since the beginning of time).
IMHO, you should be praising the anonymity of cryptocurrency as a way to strangle big government by denying them the ability to confiscate your money.
@_date: 2017-03-14 11:04:48
If you think getting rid of fiat money will reduce or even end evil, you are going to have a bad time. I hate to tell you this, but the evil is in the human condition, not money. It will be expressed in whatever way it can be, fiat or not.

Is the AGE just gold plated like the rest of our coins? It would have to be to be only worth $50.
@_date: 2017-08-07 00:52:59
I would go for it. Put it on an exchange and put in 2 orders. A stop order to protect you if it drops drastically, and a sell order at double what you bought it at. Then FORGET it and go do your thing. Check back after your semester and see what happened. Don't allow yourself to track coin prices. That way lies madness.....

Bah! You can print the words to PDF or save them as a JPG, then store them in a tiny Veracrypt container with a strong password and you will be perfectly safe (barring keystroke capture or something else hacky like that).

I'm actually a fan of the FairTax, which means the removal of all income-based taxation and withholding, to be replaced completely by a consumption-based system.
@_date: 2017-08-14 00:15:21
I would have thought that paying taxes on the income he used to buy the crypto would be enough. Scumbag IRS.....

The fee seems to be 0.0002712 BTC. I guess that is low, but still.... it's been well over 2 hours and not a single confirmation.

Maybe one day BTC will fit in better. But for now, I would gladly look like an 'idiot' counting out correct fiat for a product after exchanging BTC for that local currency!

Heh. Been nearly 20 years since I was there, obviously.

This is a terrible idea, lol. How silly would you look buying a $5 Big Mac today for 0.0022btc and then realize in a week/month that the .0022btc is now worth $50?

You've put me in the tough position of admitting I don't personally know why blockchain tech is identifiable as it flows over the internet. Those who appear to know this sort of thing say it's true, and I have to accept that. But I do know about P2P stuff. The issue there is that legitimate stuff is using various P2P technologies, so if the government were to shut it all down to put a damper on pirated movies and music, it would also affect legitimate uses, and that is a non-starter. 
My guess is that blockchain protocols are unique, used only for blockchain stuff. As such, the government could shut it all down and only us anarchists (sic) would be affected.

~~Looks like there are some bitcoin ATM in Germany. Probably not close to you though.~~ I'm surprised there are none in Frankfurt. But, it seems reasonable to suggest that you could deposit marks and get BTC in return. Then do what you wanna do.
edit- You might want to check for bitcoin ATM across the nearest border maybe.

You could convert to ETH or something and then buy back in during the turbulent prices we'll likely see for the 2-4 weeks as the process moves along!

A friend of mine got two notices from his ISP after downloading some movies via torrent. He switched to a VPN and the notices stopped. They can see torrents.
@_date: 2017-07-06 16:29:40
I will say that I agree with your suggestion that governments can and will put an end to Bitcoin if they feel it is a threat to their power. It wouldn't take much effort at all for them to sign treaties declaring blockchain traffic illegal and force ISP's all over the world to block that traffic and/or blacklist the IP addresses hosting it. 
Don't tempt the beast. It seems wise to continue to run in the background for another several years while all of the various technical issues and advancements are made. Once blockchains are better established, have more penetration into the markets, and the number of regular users has grown significantly we'll be able to step out into the light.
Even protectionist big governments in the West will not go against the will of it's People if enough of them threaten to kick the politicians out of office for attacking blockchains.

The ability to know how much I have indicates I do not have complete control over my funds. If the government can see my balance, they can take it. I should be the only human on earth who get's to decide what happens to my money under any circumstances.
@_date: 2017-06-09 12:40:34
Well.... student loans cannot be flushed out in bankruptcy, so you'll still be on the hook for that. Also, unless you net worth is significant (and you are not old), you'll end up burning through your BTC faster than the price goes up. I mean, unless you are a professional trader or something. But if your net wealth is that high, or you are a successful professional trader, debt shouldn't be an issue for you anyway, lol.
@_date: 2017-06-04 01:20:33
That is another topic I have been pretty interested in. We've all read stories about people who've lost dozens or even hundred of BTC. I can imagine the number will go up continuously as people die (and their heirs know nothing about cryptocurrency), lose equipment and paper wallets, etc... 
@_date: 2017-06-04 01:17:42
That's what I thought, and why the first couple times I read it I ignored it. But after this third or fourth time I decided I'd better ask, lol.
