There's a difference between investing and gambling.
2 years ago, Bitcoin was a gamble.  Even now, it still is.

Pssst.  The court and his PO already know:

Another way to interpret "the network" is the software/protocol that makes it more profitable for miners like miner8765 to behave greedily.  miner8765 is not the **cause** of the problem, he's/she's a **symptom** of the underlying problem.

oh that sounds even easier. :) thanks so much :)

But they weren't questioning his behavior in a civil manner.  They jumped all over his ass.
And, he was (rightly) pissed that someone in made a thread that said "All with the help of bitcoin."  bitcoin had **nothing** to do with his original deed.  And then someone comes in and wants to claim credit for bitcoin???  Not cool.

I'm not looking for someone to just give me bitcoins.
I'm looking for a solution that does not involve a bank.

I like your story, man.
I came into a lot of money about 10 years ago when I sold my internet startup.
Over the course of the past 10 years, I pissed the money all away trying to create more successful startups.
If I had it to do again, I would keep my day job, and just let the $3 million sit in the bank (or in other non-risky investments).
My mistake was thinking I was a big shot who could create another successful startup, so I kept stepping up to the plate and spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on each one, just to see them crash and burn.
Oh well.
I don't regret my decisions (the only way to learn is to try something new)...but I now realize how *lucky* I was to have 1 success.  If I ever get lucky again, I will not try to hit another home run. :)
You sound like you have a good head on your shoulders and you're not letting yourself get caught up in thinking you know more than you do.  Keep at it, man. :)

That's what software developers do: write some code, run it, see what happens, identify problems, solve problems (hopefully). And then repeat.
He may be in the "see what happens" phase right now.

Don't you need a bank account to buy from coinbase?
Part of the attraction for me re: bitcoin is bankless transactions.  When I went to coinbase and saw that they wanted my bank account info (which I don't have), I immediately left.
If they've changed, then I'll check them out again.

Every time I buy from Domino's it's at least $25 (including the delivery fee and the tip).
If he got 30 at $25, that's $750 total.  It's not too hard to imagine that some of those orders were more than $25, which could easily put him at $1000.
(I'm not even a Domino's employee [btw, you can't even spell the company name correctly?  Are you sure you work for them?] and I was able to figure that one out)

Well, you are.

The primary business occurring on his site was narcotics trafficking; therefore, he was in the business of dealing drugs.
Now, if drug-dealing had only made up 0.1% of his business, then you could legitimately make the argument that he was simply in the business of providing an open marketplace.  But that was not the case and your attempt to whitewash his activities does not fly.

Sure, prices are down 12%.  But that could be for any number of reasons:
(1) upcoming FBI auction of seized SR coins;
(2) price correction after recent run-up of 50%;
(3) "normal" price movement for a volatile instrument like btc

How was he flaunting it, dude?
He put up a post asking people who **want a free pizza** to post and let him know.
How the fuck else is he supposed to find people on reddit who need a free pizza?
@_date: 2014-06-01 06:39:13
How would that work?
Seriously, I'd be up for making something like that.
@_date: 2014-08-14 17:57:37
It looks like he didn't ask for donations originally.  It looks like he only added the donation part after a bunch of people said they wanted to donate as well.
What is wrong with you?
@_date: 2014-06-10 04:38:10
OK, thanks for that tip.  I had thought about posting a pic of the receipt, but decided against that.  Sounds like that was the right precaution to take. :)
@_date: 2014-06-10 05:01:41
Cool.  I created a coinbase account and clicked the link you provided.  It used my webcam to scan the qr code and is now in the process of starting to import. 
@_date: 2014-06-15 20:39:30
OK, so objectively it was not wrong, but subjectively it was wrong.

You mean the Feds, who are basically in bed with the Central Bank, which controls the magical printing press that creates said money?
Yeah, I don't think they need $ from this little bake sale to make their wheels go 'round.

You don't seem to understand how businesses work.  They are in business to make money, and they do that by providing products or services that people are willing to pay for.
If you use a credit card, then **YOU** are the problem, not the banks.
@_date: 2014-05-19 02:20:36
Your abuse of the investing phrase "short position" makes your point very difficult to follow.
@_date: 2014-06-17 04:40:36
Ah, I see.  You have an axe to grind.  No wonder it's been so difficult to have a rational conversation with you.
I'll ignore everything you have to say on this matter.

Isn't the future of Bitcoin dependent on miners authenticating transactions?  If people stop mining, doesn't Bitcoin become vulnerable?
@_date: 2014-07-15 15:34:51
I agree that in some ways it is less of a gamble now than it was 2 years ago.
But we've recently had the situation where ghash.io had about 50% of the network power and **no one** could stop it for about a week.  It exposed a potential fatal flaw in the protocol and I don't think that the problem has been fixed (or even **can** be fixed).  The problem went away (does anyone know why, exactly?) and everyone has gone back to sticking their heads in the sand.
So, 2 years ago, the biggest hurdle was that not many people knew about bitcoin and it wasn't being used in many places.  Today, it's gotten a lot of press, is being accepted at many different venues and a lot of people are starting to take it seriously.  So, from the adoption and use point of view, it's less of a gamble today than 2 years ago.
But, from a technical point of view, one of the underlying tenets that the whole system is build upon has been shown to be (potentially) flawed.  In that sense, it is **more** of a gamble than it was 2 years ago.

Wait? What?
How was it wrong?  The guy was running an illegal operation, selling illegal drugs over the internet.  His bitcoins were ill-gotten gain.  If all of his proceeds had been in cash would you still be saying the seizure was wrong?
@_date: 2014-08-14 18:01:05
Fuck! You are an asshole of the highest degree.
I_Give_Pizzas helps people out with free pizzas and you just want to go around and shit all over him.
Fuck off, shithead.
@_date: 2014-06-10 05:04:01
OK, I will be careful with the receipt and treat it like cash.  I like your point about not being able to take pics or vids of the private keys: people can't spend pics of your cash, but pics of the private key give them access to the btc.
@_date: 2014-06-16 02:23:55
No, he was not running a legitimate, legal business.  In the U.S., it is illegal to run a drug-dealing business for illegal drugs.
@_date: 2014-06-13 05:32:03
How do you propose that people get bitcoins then?  I've tried buying from people via local bitcoin, but that has not worked.  I have no bank account, so I can't buy from coinbase.
While the bitcoin ATM I recently used was less than ideal, **it actually worked** and I finally own some bitcoins, and have been using them when and where I can.  I'm even getting my family (parents and children) into bitcoin by sending some to them.
@_date: 2014-06-10 05:16:43
this is so cool.  i just sent a little bit to my sealswithclubs account and it showed up after a few minutes. :)
i want to get my parents set up, too.  do i just need to get them to create accounts at coinbase and then i can send some btc to them there?
@_date: 2014-06-13 17:11:40
It's probably negligible.
Although some people here are crying "the sky is falling," it seems like it's business as usual on the exchanges (eg: prices aren't plummeting).
