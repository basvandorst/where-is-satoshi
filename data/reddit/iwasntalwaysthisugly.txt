good shitpost
btc can easily go 100x from here.  possibly more
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:20:02
i'll let you guess which way i think crypto is going   :)
@_date: 2018-05-23 18:10:37
wow, weak hand.  is this your first downturn?
@_date: 2018-05-17 18:23:52
Do you think no one has thought about this before?  You just think people have missed this kind of thing for generations of engineers before you?  
I'm genuinely curious why you think this hasn't been done if it's such a good idea.
@_date: 2018-05-18 15:03:02
you mean they sold their house.  how rude of them selling their own thing.
@_date: 2018-05-17 16:52:09
one wrong doesn't make another one right.  it's a classic mis-direction in debate that doesn't work.  address the issue instead of pointing something else out.
@_date: 2018-05-08 18:51:35
you have no idea how little power the products you listed take to run the payment networks you listed.  BTC's computation usage dwarfs what is used in datacenters all across the *world.
edit:   *for performing what the companies listed do that compete with BTC.

point to the blockchain btc then.
do any of you know how blockchain works?  jfc

printed money is pretty lame though...  most of what we value isn't in physcial bills.  I like this a lot:  
@_date: 2018-05-17 18:18:16
Yeah, in 2014 i sold all my crypto hodlings.  Boy am I glad i did too! I was down almost 75%!
wait, no, i had big balls and held.  In fact, i still hodl and am up over 2250% as of right now.
Your advice is terrible.  Perhaps it's good for other investments but for crypto with such a bright future, selling in the worst thing people can do.
@_date: 2018-05-17 17:11:18
Omg this space has issues
@_date: 2018-05-17 17:01:33
it's in the weeks after the conf.

Yeah, exactly why we have so much heat recovery processes in place now. I really love my new BMW thermal drive. Improved my cars efficiency by twenty percent. 
@_date: 2018-05-23 18:14:59
so how many btc will coinbase create, then, smart guy?  how many over the 21 million will there be?
@_date: 2018-05-24 18:19:02
they aren't making any bitcoins.  sigh
@_date: 2018-05-08 19:22:58
Is the only thing the banks do is make payments?
@_date: 2018-05-24 18:18:35
because they aren't making new bitcoins.  they are lending your btc.
nevermind, i dont' care any longer.
@_date: 2018-05-25 18:57:51
then how can you be frightened so easily?  this is par for the course with crypto.
@_date: 2018-05-17 18:34:47
ok, dude.  i'm done.
@_date: 2018-05-17 18:24:57
Looks like he or she didn't take own advice.
@_date: 2018-05-03 22:56:12
good god dude:
"The Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis has provided some high-profile validation for a core premise of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency. A blog post this week based on an earlier Fed research paper said that “Bitcoin units have no intrinsic value”—but added that currencies “such as the U.S. dollar, the euro, and the Swiss franc…have no intrinsic value either.”" - 
also, 25 million includes all the exchange accounts?  how many does coinbase alone have?  
don't be an idiot.  jfc
@_date: 2018-05-17 18:10:09
close to zero of this is done now because it's so inefficient. do you live under a (cold) rock?

how stupid were you to not buy all the bitcoin you could 5 years ago?
@_date: 2018-05-17 18:36:43
is btc the first computing system that generates heat?  are all you people this dense and arrogant?  heat is a byproduct of almost everything we do and close to zero of it is recaptured because we spend more heat recovering the heat we would get.  it's a losing proposition.  
@_date: 2018-05-18 18:29:57
keep your politics out of my crypto space, thanks.
@_date: 2018-05-18 21:23:07
no, the incomplete sentences and poor grammar killed it for me.
also, whatever dude.  hodling strictly means hodling tight during downturns when others want your coins cheap.  that's it, nothing more and certainly has nothing to do with shadowy characters that may or may not want to start wars with your crypto.  Like i said, keep your nutcase politics to yourself.  plus your tinfoil hat; you can keep that too.  i'm sure your hair rarely is washed since soap is a construct of The Man to control your brain through chemical means.
@_date: 2018-05-17 16:58:46

there is so much wrong here.
@_date: 2017-03-18 06:51:59
Yep. The question is how low it can go. 
@_date: 2017-03-17 14:40:27
but anything btc can do, altcoins can be coded for, too.  
I think there's going to be 5 or 10 long term coins that each do something a little bit different or more efficiently, etc.  btc is great but it can't do everything for all people...  it's just asking too much for software.

quality input!
@_date: 2017-03-19 01:35:19
Btc is a long game.  Stay out if the short term craziness unsettles you.  All this crap needs to be settled long before mass adoption happens.  This is painful but required.
@_date: 2017-03-16 21:36:15
This wasn't funny the first million times.
@_date: 2017-03-20 05:26:45
Look at etc and eth from last year. Whatever happens after a fork it wont be good for btc in general.  However, i thought the price for btc would crash after the etf decision so wfk...
@_date: 2017-03-17 15:03:04
this kind of talk confuses me.  no software is everything to everyone so i'd prefer lots of coins go to the moon.  it doesn't have to be either/or in this debate.  same shit is on the other side with the flippening, etc.  equally not understandable.
@_date: 2017-03-16 21:28:41
This implies there is nothing wrong in bitcoinlandia.  There is. It wont be solved soon, either.

The problem with a ledger is that there's a ledger.  there are ways to mask what you're doing but in the end it's all there, every transaction...
like mentioned, localbitcoins, using alt coins, or going from btc to alt to btc will make it more difficult.  maybe you could find a tumbler, too.  I don't know, i've never looked into them.
@_date: 2017-03-16 22:43:49
again, quality input.  next time proofread.
i said nothing false.  not that it matters, but i have the majority of my holdings in BTC.  It seems you'd be ok saying your house isn't on fire when it's flooded.  Think for yourself and realize what's going on.  BTC's problems are getting lots of press and there's literally no end in site.  Both sides are bitching at each other as the ship is sinking.
@_date: 2017-08-28 19:42:41
Thanks for the tip, redditorforfourdays!
@_date: 2017-08-30 18:56:16
there are more places that tax crypto than just the US...  good luck to you.
@_date: 2017-08-26 19:22:49
Directly buying things to avoid taxes is pretty poor advice.
@_date: 2017-08-31 21:15:18
yeah, way out on a limb.  I bet that those reading this will visit a bathroom in the next 48 hours.
@_date: 2017-08-25 19:22:19
but you had your key to get the BTC out.  You're being audited for your BTC/BTH profits, remember?
@_date: 2017-08-26 19:25:53
4 million is def no whale. Not in 2017 anyway.
@_date: 2017-08-26 19:20:59
You might not pay it but it's still taxed.
@_date: 2017-08-26 19:24:13
He's saying the bch value will cover all taxes. 
@_date: 2017-08-30 18:54:02
If you're young (less than 60), you shoudl take 3% of your total to leave enough to earn more to outpace inflation and make back what you took out.  That leaves around $50k.  Not a small amount of money for sure.  Can a family of 6 live on that?  Not mine.  Just paying for health insurance alone would be tough.  THat's not even taking taxes into account.
@_date: 2017-08-25 18:56:39
it's all supply/demand stuff.  miners will push to get the most cash one way or another.  In my first example I talk about Apple.  why do they charge more than other phone companies?  Because they can.  Why don't they charge twice as much?  Because they can't.
miners will always push for more and the market will give them what they are willing or the market will move away.  Miners will give a little to prevent that.  
@_date: 2017-08-25 17:09:35
businesses are in place to make the most money from customers.  can Apple sell phones for 40% less?  Yes.  Do they because they are such a great company?  no, they ruthlessly take money from people because they can and will continue to maximize profits because they are able to.  Mining is a business.  To think anything less than that is ignorant.  
With that said, both sides in the scaling debate are aholes.  no one is clean here...
@_date: 2017-08-28 19:58:18
you really should have given me the best advice for this thread:  don't feed the dumbass troll
@_date: 2017-08-25 17:12:30
in the unlikely event that you're audited (if you're in the US anyway), you'll be hammered if you try those.
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:41:23
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:15:47
if you are in the US then you'll never get those prices.  treasury bonds on the highest end is under 3% for 30 years.  feel free to send a savings account that has a 1% return these days.  
Check your local CD rates, too.  they are terrible.  interest rates all over the place suck ass.
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:54:59
Then the weak hands will leave. It's no big deal. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:18:42
for every one group shorting, there will be 5 or 10 going long on btc.
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:56:12
There's no savings account that will pay you what inflation takes away. 
@_date: 2017-04-14 17:18:41
it sounds like the guy that bought BTC back in the day on a credit card and ended up with a new house. Of course, you dont' hear about the people afterwards that lost everything in the crash and had to declare bankruptcy or something.
I vote against this...
@_date: 2017-04-07 17:49:28
for every person that wins in trading someone else loses.  good luck to you.  
i learned the hard way to hodl.

I'd argue the anon point too. I'm a stickler for that though....
@_date: 2017-04-11 17:36:04
Not worth the pita it will be imo.
@_date: 2017-04-07 17:06:39
am i serious? yes.  I don't know enough about the subject technically to comment on segwit/bu/wtfe but i do know that btc is in a hole atm.  That conflict is the specific kink that I believe in general needs to be worked out.  imagine if this fiasco was happening 10 or 20 years from now.  jfc it could literally be calamitous... there will be at least one blockchain that will be critical to humanity (like the web is for us today - imagine a world-wide web outage) so getting all the kinks out now is best for humanity.
@_date: 2017-04-03 04:22:25
You are going to cinema
@_date: 2017-04-15 02:07:33
I'm pretty sure you've already violated the law with your post. The act of just trying to stay under the reporting amount is illegal by itself in the US.
@_date: 2017-04-07 02:13:01
you're welcome
tl;dr np
@_date: 2017-04-06 22:54:57
let's have some patience and iron out the kinks before things get too cray.  if things aren't 100% rock solid before the moon then it'll harm btc and crypto in the long run.  people will think it can't be relied on.
tl;dr  work now, moon soon...
@_date: 2017-04-21 02:10:47
good luck trying to find someone to sell at market rate in large quantities
@_date: 2017-04-21 15:03:05
I would be surprised if lots of countries haven't been buying btc just in case.
@_date: 2017-04-14 05:47:09
I'm not a fan of this advice... What's the best that gold or cash can do? Now, what is the answer for bitcoin? If you dont need the money now, dont touch a single satoshi for years.  There's just too much on the line to settle early.

@_date: 2017-04-10 15:01:00
you are right. btc is far from anon and if you're doing anything nefarious, probably best to stick to cash.  every btc transaction is public so it can be traced.  Is it hard?  for sure. but i guess there's a growing community of blockchain analysts that do the tracking for a living. i have no idea though.  i just hodl.
there are ways to make it harder to track but in general, your post is spot on...
@_date: 2017-04-19 18:34:48
Unless people start to abandon btc due to the delay and expense.
@_date: 2017-04-21 14:58:07
oooooooooooooor hodl your btc until it can be used with the purchase power of a half of a million dollars today.
@_date: 2018-03-30 02:26:29
I suggest not looking at crypto ever again. You'll really hate yourself for having such a weak hand. 
@_date: 2018-03-22 21:38:57

If you invest now you'll get get both coins, if that comes to pass.  That way you're hedging your bets on the hard fork.  If you wait for the HF to happen, you may pick wrong or pay more to duplicate your coins.  
@_date: 2017-10-31 21:38:40
use the right wallet for the coins you want to move (after the split).  nothing else you need to do.
@_date: 2017-10-31 21:44:14


this is exactly the opposite of reality.  This is precisely what's supposed to happen in cases like these in japan. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 21:39:51
Now forward test and prove your platform by posting your trades with what, when, and how much that can be verified over time.  Until then it's not much more than fitting the past with a current template.  good luck at any rate.  i'll keep on hodling.
@_date: 2017-10-31 21:44:29
This is exactly how it's supposed to go.
@_date: 2018-04-25 14:53:20
use coinbase versus gdax and it's close to 8%.  4% to sell or buy your coins then the TX fee to get your fiat in your bank acct.  
@_date: 2018-04-11 20:11:25
nxt certainly didn't experiment when it went production with full proof of stake in 2013  :)
@_date: 2018-04-25 15:08:33
did you actually calculate the whole fee though?  If you use coinbase, they charge you a market taker fee that's baked into the cost.  It's not a line item on the TX.  If btc is selling for 1000 dollars, they offer to sell it to you for more but not list that as a fee.
@_date: 2018-04-02 06:16:33
You're missing the point. Idc
@_date: 2018-04-25 14:53:54
but lots of people use coinbase and not the sister site, gdax.  enormous fees via coinbase.
@_date: 2018-04-02 06:06:27
yeah, especially considering there's no way to adjust anything in software to thwart future problems.  I'm so sad that software is set in stone.
@_date: 2018-04-02 06:07:18
I wish i sold all in 2015.  i'm really suffering now.  i wish i didn't have a strong hand.  everyone should read your comment.
@_date: 2018-04-02 05:59:08
old school goes to gold in uncertain times.  new school will go to crypto. 
@_date: 2018-04-04 22:23:09
I think you misunderstand what i'm trying to say.  this is a small blip in the long term market. if you look at the last 5 years, do you see the crash of 2013 in the market?  Practically no. If i had a weak hand and sold in 2014, i wouldn't have gotten the insane gains i did in the last 18 months.  I was down probably 70% in 2014 and 2015 but i kept buying. 
 yes, this is a terrible time for the market but it's natural for something so new to be crazy.  it takes time to settle out which will still take years.  this is a huge flow of wealth that's going on right now.  if people just stay strong and hold they will be happy.
@_date: 2018-04-06 18:21:37
they are already not anon...  they just have to look.  
@_date: 2018-04-02 06:04:44
yeah, i did the same thing a while back.  I never should have bought and held when i made my first BTC purchase.  I was so dumb in 2013 that i couldn't see that crypto is for suckers.  don't get me started on the eth i bought at ico.  damn, i was a total idiot.  I hope people see your post and then my story and for sure steer clear of anything dealing with fake internet money.
@_date: 2018-04-04 18:03:54
did you read my post?  
@_date: 2018-04-16 13:01:04
eventually all exchanges will report if they do business with US customers and banks.  All TXs will be reported just like traditional trading houses (like e-trade) do today.  
@_date: 2018-04-11 15:41:34
use coinbase's sister exchange, gdax, for much better fees.  coinbase itself is super expensive to use.
@_date: 2018-04-21 20:58:10
coinbase isn't far from 8% when all fees are added in, though.
@_date: 2018-04-02 06:05:15
it is.  gold and crypto are and will be safe havens.
@_date: 2018-04-25 15:45:16
i hope i'm the one that's wrong.  lord knows coinbase doesn't need the profit.
@_date: 2018-04-11 15:39:08
ummmmmmmmmmm, no.  your advice just adds cost to the task and gains no benefit.
@_date: 2018-04-02 06:09:26
I wish i didn't buy at the top in 2013.  i'm such an idiot.  i absolutely wish i sold.
