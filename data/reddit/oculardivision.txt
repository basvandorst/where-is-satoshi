Sure if your literally only talking about overall profit made off bitcoins that makes sense.
On the other hand, if your are more interested in actual adoption of Bitcoin as a currency and overall public perception, everything you said just said goes out the window.
The mentality that even if it goes to $1, it's ok because it's still an increase in value completely ignores market mentality and how that effects widespread adoption. Which to me directly backs the belief that this is a bubble and it's long term ramifications are bad for those of us that would like to see crypto replace fiat. Your entire premise is: it doesn't matter what happens to Bitcoin as long as some people were able to extract profit. And some how this means it's not a bubble? It's literally the mentality that lead to the mortgage market collapse.

When there's a market correction and the people that are looking at Bitcoin as a get rich quick method sell their holdings in fear of losing everything.

Depending on how you mean 'adoption' , I'd disagree that the inflation in value is due to adoption. 
If you mean it in reference to it's true purpose, a currency, I think it's obviously not correct..
If you mean as an investment instrument that promises ridiculous amounts of profit, we're both correct.

I guess if you consider being solely developed by a corporation that holds all licensing rights, but gives free access to the standard. Then yeah, it was totally open source.
But if you take into fact that JVC didn't give any of the manufactures actual ownership over the standard, wouldn't have allowed modifications to it and instead just allowed them to build hardware that met the standard, it was definitely not open source
@_date: 2018-06-26 14:30:13

Read the post I responded to...this is a hypothetical situation presented by someone else, your reply should be directed at them.
In response to the hypothetical situation were it's  "a standard feature in all minor operating systems" my tongue in cheek statement holds true. You are ignoring context repeatedly solely so you can spout rhetoric in response to a joke.

Biggest difference here is that Amazon is actually something he says he regrets not investing in earlier because of its success. Bitcoin as of now is behaving exactly like he said it would.
Your argument boils down to "it doesn't matter that he's right about this, he was wrong about something else before"
Taking investment advice from Buffett is a smart move, betting against him is going to have you lose more times than you win.

It's no more usable in a P2P setting than it is commercially. There are benefits to using for smaller vendors (lower transaction and operational cost) but as far as the usability of bitcoin as a currency its exactly the same for ALL parties. That's kind of the point of bitcoin. Transaction methodology is exactly the same no matter how big or small of an entity you are.

Ahhh my bad, I thought a few of them looked pretty similar to you. I'd be interested in seeing anything you'd like to share.
I do like the style and approach, and I can see what you mean with the symbolism. I did notice that the spray cans incorporate references to the other pieces as well (it's also the piece I'd want to win). You certainly make some good art, do happen to ever do gallery shows?
