6400 is a very important level to watch. Last week when we had the sharp upside reversal after testing 6100 we moved very quickly up to 6400 so there was massive buying/short covering from 6100 up to 6400 where we leveled off. If we start trading lower below 6400 for awhile i would be very concerned. Expect BTC to test recent lows if we are holding below 6400. As long as we can hold above we could move back to the upper range of 6700 and then see if we can build a higher low off of 6400. 
We are at an important crossroad right now.

Sudden jump in BCH, anyone know whats going on?
Should get BTC and other alts moving soon
@_date: 2018-09-11 15:24:29
I think we could be seeing a short squeeze higher soon. This down move below 6200 was meet with some decent buying / lack of sellers. Any shorts seeing that action are probably thinking that they will likely need to cover their positions soon if we don't see any more downside movement. I think if we get back above 6300 then we could see the squeeze. If i was in a short sellers position right now I would be happy to lock in gains down at this level from the recent highs of 7400 in such a short amount of time, wait for a move higher to get back in.

why don't you just HODL and check back in 2 years then, you will be kicking yourself. Everyone always worries about price when there is so much awesome stuff going on behind the scenes in crypo. If you're in crypo you should be in it for the long term potential not profits

I funnel some of my day trade profits to a wallet I use for everyday purchases so my btc wallet is meant to be spent on items, I am happy to support the use of bitcoin by making purchases I would normally make with fiat. My goal is to completely get away from using fiat. That's the whole purpose of this, isn't it!! 
@_date: 2018-05-23 20:15:02
who else bought more on that dip?
@_date: 2018-05-19 15:48:22
That was is a good way to do things. It’s the same process as opening a bank account. You need to first fund your account which will take some time but once you get into coinbase, I would suggest going through GDAX to buy or sell using limit orders. I generate day trading profits through GDAX using limit orders and then transfer those profits over to a coinbase wallet and have that wallet hooked up to a debit card I can use anywhere.... essentially buying things with bitcoin.

this market is looking worse and worse, not liking this no volume random spike up spike down. This is not good for the health of the market. As a HODLER I am worried.

Justice Department is looking into bitcoin price manipulation... This might actually be a good thing for us HODLERS. I have a feeling there are a good number of wall street people out there who have been manipulating price to the downside for various reasons. Their time shall come to an end. Lets look forward to FOMO and LAMBO times and party like its 1999.
@_date: 2018-05-03 13:59:47
today is the day fellow HODLERS, going to hit our recent highs today
@_date: 2018-05-03 19:41:19
This makes sense, while bitcoin has been range bound a lot of alts have been rocketing higher yet BTC stayed still. Seems like a rotation of money across asset classes. I think we will see this happen often going forward. When BTC is stable money tends to go into the alts and when they get over stretched they often sell and convert back to BTC.
@_date: 2018-05-16 14:17:28
I got in a good price as a HODLER (around 6K). I understand between 6K and 11.5K is just a range and expected to move around a lot in there. I believe longer term with markets moving towards accepting institutional money and custody available, we will see a huge inflow of money. There has been very little volume lately, seems like people are sitting on the sidelines and just waiting. I think the mindset of original adopters is to just HODL and people like myself who are later adopters who believe in the underlying value of crypto will also HODL. This is what will create a floor in the price. It's a matter of time before price moves higher and when it does I think it will be as aggressive as the move in DEC 2017.

Anyone noticing some weird price action on Coinbase pro? The spread is super wide and the order flow seems super weird. Different from what I've normally seen... feels like we are about to MOON though from the price action.
@_date: 2018-10-02 16:35:15
Bots have definitely been active as of late. I have been noticing that there is very large size on the offer but no actual real orders behind them. People see this size - get nervous - sell. It slowly ticks lower and lower with the same thing happening on the offer. I believe they are trying to accumulate as it moves down and then at some point they just lift their offers and the market moves higher very quickly which can be added by them buying a good amount when they lift, just spraying the other offers with buys. This forces people to jump in quickly and price moves up extremely fast where they can easily offload their positions. Rinse and repeat! 
Best thing to do is just not trade while they are doing their thing and just pick good entry and exit areas and not worry too much about what they are up to in the meantime.

@_date: 2018-06-10 13:39:20
I am normally a bitcoin bull, but this price action over the past couple of months is very concerning for me. I am on the sideline in cash right now. We breached a major level of 7300 and 7000 is in sight where below things could get very ugly. I believe in higher prices down the road but why sit though the pain right now when you could pickup btc at lower prices of around 3-5K where ALL the weak hands get shaken out. Things look dangerous on a technical level right now. I am preserving my capital for clear signs of bottoming.
@_date: 2018-06-25 14:52:20
yeah seeing this too. I wonder if a large whale is running something to disguise larger orders they might be putting in or someone trying to create the impression of a large amount of volume. 
@_date: 2018-03-24 13:41:23
This is my game plan, I am expecting BTC to break above 9K today and by the end of the weekend could be at 10K and on monday I think a nice push higher to when this recent down move began at about 10600 which is where I will start trimming my position. From there I expect price to pull in but don't have any idea where it will bottom out so I will start to build a small position and have ample cash on hand to slowly build up my position again. then MOON

How does everyone calculate their profit/loss in trades? Seems like most of the exchanges don't provide that on their platforms which is a bit strange. I've been working on an excel doc and building scripts to provide me my Profit/loss updates at regular intervals when I'm in trades that get sent to me via my phone. Will probably share how to to build at some point after I fine tune things.

Twitter Founder Jack Dorsey invests 2.5 Mil in Lighting Labs and his other company Square has started integrating BTC into its payment processing system. Dorsey sees BTC as the worlds currency in 10 years from now. IMO this is very big news and brings significant credibility to BTC as a form of transaction. He is highly viewed in the tech industry and on wall street. He's always been one step ahead of the game.
