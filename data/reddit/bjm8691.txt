Having this issue for over a week. Tried multiple desktops and still receiving unknown error. Support has answered 3 times with the same generic response which is that I need to verify but ignores the issue of the unknown error. Hope this gets resolved soon as it is frustrating but not sure what else I can do but wait.

still not getting any help with this. I must have been told you need to verify by three different reps and none of them acknowledge that I cant because of an error on there end. I really have no idea what to do here

Waiting about one week myself for a "unknown error" that keeps coming up. Support is none existent. Not really sure what we can do but wait.

thanks for the reply sir. that was about an hr vs almost a week. unfortunately the response you gave me was not helpful. I cant submit what your backend wont accept. None of my info has changed and i have not moved. i hit verify and still receive "An unknown error has occured". not sure what i else i can do.
