Welcome to speculative investing!
But seriously if you looked at bitcoin's price history and then decided to buy in heavily when it was at a skyrocketed peak of 19k for mere days (hours?) then you should get someone else to handle your investments.

As a corollary an interesting point he brings up in that talk is how inflation makes your house more affordable. 
Say you get a loan with a fixed rate of interest. Then inflation occurs. The value of the house goes up with inflation, hopefully your pay goes up with inflation, but the loan stays the same. Effectively you now owe less on your house.
Governments effectively do the same thing at will when they inflate their currencies.
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:41:12
I suppose that's fair.
I'm just not going to feel too bad for people who bought at a peak and then were disappointed when it corrects.

The way I keep hearing it is bitcoin is the MySpace of cryptos.
In the back of my head though I keep thinking community cryptos will always have a place because any country-backed currency is going to be built with an intrinsic mechanism for the country to inflate it at will and if they are clever with a way to collect taxes from transactions.

Milton Freidman [has an excellent (albeit hour long) talk on this]( wherein he describes inflation as a tool the government uses to pay its debts and temporarily boost the economy despite those boosts being short-lived and eventually reversed to hurt lower classes.

It's not like we will run out of bitcoin for sale and it's definitely not like bitcoin is dramatically stabilizing. That was a ridiculously risky short term bet any way you try to phrase it.

That's true. I'm not sure how the math works out with regard to your house's appreciation, but it's interesting to think depending on your finances inflation can benefit you.
Of course if you're a government in debt, well it's literally printing your own money.

There's this idea people have that you just make it so lower classes have more money and everything will be gravy but I feel like it will always stacks up so that the "top 1%" have everything and the rest of us have the bottom line and what we can grab for ourselves.
I dunno, I guess I'm sorta pushing the problem I've been thinking about on other people hoping to get some different perspective.
@_date: 2018-03-03 03:14:59
Explain how I'm mistaken then.
Also, I never said they invented it. If that was your takeaway you've misunderstood and should read it again with less antagonism.
The essence of it is rights only exist to the extent that they can be enforced. Subsequently you have no natural right to property beyond your own ability to fend off contenders for it.
People created government to be that enforcement of rights we collectively wanted but couldn't enforce on our own.
@_date: 2018-02-07 16:44:18
And so you're laughing because... I wanted it to go lower so I could buy more?
@_date: 2018-02-04 17:49:58


This is the big problem for me, and one that has been driving people who use cryptos as currency to move to other platforms that provide better features like privacy.
This is also why many people call it a ponzi scheme, because unlike stocks or other similar forms of investment bitcoin has no way to gain value but for other people to pour money into it.
When it was more like a currency at least it had a future as a payment system, but so far that ship seems to have sailed, especially with purchases in bitcoin being treated as capital investment gains for example by the IRS.
@_date: 2018-03-02 03:33:16
Oh, just the libertarian angle. Got it.
@_date: 2018-03-02 13:36:21
The point is evolution makes choices based on the on the ground truth, abstract ideals are nice but if you don't base it in history or find empirical evidence to back what you're saying it's basically just fiction.
The "ideal version has never been tried" defense is an excuse to explain that when it has been tried it never works out long term.
@_date: 2018-03-03 05:22:57

@_date: 2018-03-03 06:09:41
Yeah, I mean buying strategies are what they are.
History though has taught us exchanges are not a safe place to keep crypto long term, only when buying or selling.
@_date: 2018-02-04 17:56:21


This is the key differentiation. Plenty of people have heard of bitcoin, few own it, almost no one uses it as a currency.
@_date: 2018-03-02 22:48:49
Ah I see. 
Yeah that's an interesting concept, if awkward in the sense that being the monopoly holder on violence and having been submitted to by basically the rest of the population the government subsequently defines property rights and so it isn't capable of theft per se under that construct.
That is to say, the right to own anything is not inherent in nature and only exists precisely because we collectively have created the government construct to tax you and enforce the construct of property rights to begin with.
Subsequently, the government can't "steal" because if it took something by definition it has a right to it within its own construct. If it doesn't have a right to your property you're saying the government construct isn't valid in which case you never had a right to the property to begin with.
Either way, given that there is no feasible alternative so far what can you do but try to improve the existing system or at least the people in it that you can reach?

You keep using the word "ethical", what do you mean by that?
@_date: 2018-03-02 04:24:44
That's not social engineering, it's called torture and if it doesn't work there's always the time tested option of just leaving you to rot in a cell. You think your mind is strong, but when you've been left starving for years without sunlight or decent human contact suddenly you find until now that has never been tested.
But even then it doesn't matter because again they own a monopoly on violence.
The bottom line here is you have zero empirical evidence to back up your claims. There are no signs any of the established heirarchies are changing and plenty that they are co opting cryptos for their own gain.
@_date: 2018-03-13 02:06:50
