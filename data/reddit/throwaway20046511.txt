I have a pretty good idea on how it worked from beginning to end. Only thing I don't know about is what kinds of deals were made and the pr side. But yes miners were run when I was there. For about 20 minutes. I don't know to which pool. I don't know all the different ways to test the machines but I can say that testing was paramount. The failure rate when I started was just unacceptable. Like I said before, the management was awful. It hot much better as some competent people were hired but those kinds of people should have been there in the first place.    
    
I think people imagine that bfl had a server room like knc. Nope not even close. Actually the location of the company is awful. They share the building with 2 other businesses. I think bfl deserves a lot of the flak they get but I will depend some people that were just dealt a shit hand.

I worked there and disagree, kinda. I'm not a shill I don't work there anymore and worked at a time where things got slightly better but still not great. I'd say a large part of the reason they were so late was incompetence. The people building had no experience with electronics. The firmware seemed unstable always. There were definitely good people that work there, but they got there too late.

Worked at bfl. Lots of hardworking and nice people are there. Just poorly run. Not enough space for enough people to keep up with demand.    
Edit- am I being down voted because I said the company had some nice people? Grow up everyone. I have plenty of bad things to say too

I would but I'm afraid bfl will figure out who I am and try to go after me legally.
