The same is true of everything else in the world. We ascribe value to things like homes, gold, cans of tunafish, headphones, USD/EUR, women's perfume, a cup of coffee, etc, etc.
Also, what you describe has nothing to do with how a Ponzi scheme works. You're just describing how basic commerce works.

They are everywhere...just read the comment section from any article reposted here from a major site like msnbc, forbes, etc...the uneducated responses are a dime a dozen. it's easier for them to make claims without being concerned with the evidence or facts...meanwhile, btc has skyrocketed since.

I think this is a valid point, actually. Because of this, those who own BTC should either have a safety deposit box with seed/pw/instructions for next of kin, or they should teach their next of kin how to access it.
Nevertheless, your solution to BTC is for everybody to stop using it because there are risks associated? Could it be possible that others have a different risk tolerance than you? 
I mean, venture capitalists can lose everything, as can soldiers, police officers, deep sea divers,  etc...people take risks even with their own lives because they have a different tolerance for risk.
Just because your risk tolerance is lower than someone else's, doesn't mean that other person is wrong or misguided. It is like me saying, 'Oh, I can't believe you like downhill skiing--so dangerous, I'd never strap waxed boards to my feet and go racing down a large hill. People get seriously hurt doing that every season...therefore, you should all stop skiing!'

Just buy a Trezor and send them there...easy peasy.

Yeah, one would think there ought to be redundant datacenters so they can quickly regroup in case of an event like this.

I suppose it is just that 'pyramid scheme' is such a loaded term that it makes me uncomfortable.
I'm with you in the idea that BTC is still not user-friendly enough for mass adoption...coins, keys, wallets, seed words, exchanges, segwit, etc.
I'm not trying to be argumentative or pedantic on the 'pyramid scheme' part, but my feeling is that one can say the same thing about IPO's, property development, etc. Getting in early usually means big profits if it is something the market wants.
I have no idea what's going on with BCC or whatever we're calling it this week...on one hand, I'm like: 'Cool, free money!' and on the other, I'm like: 'Probably going to crash once we get some liquidity!', but I'm also like: 'Perhaps I'll just HODL this too, because it could continue to grow over the next 6 mos.'
In the end, I'm just a bloke who wants to give his family a degree of financial security, and so far, cryptocurrencies have outperformed all my other investments, so I'm not complaining.
I appreciate your tone and perspective too, and I'm not blaming you for being cautious when it comes to money or relatively new financial systems.

At least we now know that someone is actually at Poloniex...presumably working through all those unanswered support tickets from the last couple months. /s
