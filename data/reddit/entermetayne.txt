I think there is manipulation (or susceptibility to manipulate) in any commodity, I don't see bitcoin as unique in that way.

This technical analysis is good for bitcoin!

That is bad.  If that's true, it's a significant problem.

LOL, because of Encarta banks will be destroyed.
Love this technical analysis.

Nothing happened?  Are you kidding?  20,000 equals NOTHING HAPPENED?!

“Because it happened before, it will happen again” is as reliable as “it hasn’t happened before so it won’t happen”

What was the manipulation amount?  I read the article but missed that.

This is the kind of technical analysis I expect to see here.

I didn't think such levels of edginess were possible.

Ignoring criticism because 52 times predictions were wrong seems dangerous.
@_date: 2018-07-02 04:01:04
I’m guessing that there is no true criticism you accept?  “They don’t understand game theory!!!!”
@_date: 2018-07-03 17:49:40
I would not waste your time arguing with that guy.

This subreddit is dangerous.  Misinformed people are confidently losing a lot of money.
