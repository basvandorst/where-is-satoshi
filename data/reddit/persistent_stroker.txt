It is better for ROE to have the old futures end low and the new futures start at a low.

Depends on how much you buy of course. And I'm not going to disclose my financial situation, whether it is 10 dollars or a million. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:24:27
What? No!
Deposit to Coinbase/GDAX and transfer your fiat to GDAX. Then buy with a limit post only order.

For alts you have to go to their community. Subscribe to their Twitter and slack, irc, or discord.
Then you also have private crypto trading groups doing analysis and having discussions about crypto and investing in general. You often have to pay a recurring fee to stay as a member, but you get really good alerts.
For instance, I got an alert yesterday that Ada would be listed on binance 5 minutes before it went live. Bought Ada at 1000 sats and sold 5 minutes later at 1300 sats.

Oh yeah in that case you'd do that.

"Jesus said my people perish for lack of knowledge"
What an ironic thing to say
@_date: 2018-05-08 20:17:12
Go look for it yourself; I'm not your lackey. Just shared a cool project.
@_date: 2018-05-08 21:07:54
The only reason in bringing that up was to explain that a database does not need to be included in the blockchain itself. I did not speak of the quality of the project or similar projects, nor do I intent to discuss it any further with you.

Don't need to host them on the blockchain itself. there are projects like substratum working on decentralizing the internet. They have a working prototype that enables an internet user in China to bypass the Great FireWall and access regular websites. 
Sites hosted on substratums decentralized network are not hosted on the blockchain, but it a separate database layer. The blockchain is to verify the integrity of that database; it actually allows for colocated hosting (forgot the proper English term).

Rice and silica are a myth. You think a piece of rice is going to clean up minerals, chemicals and corrosion?
If your device is working after a rice bath, it would've worked without a rice bath.
Guys I'm a repair tech with a business doing 250 repairs in a good week. You can downvote me all you want, it doesn't change the fact that rice doesn't do shit.
Here, let me get Louis Rossman to explain it:
 
And Jessa
And another one from Louis about drying shit out:
@_date: 2017-11-05 10:01:35
The problem is that corrosion happens when you're simply drying the shit from the board.
The best thing to do is to displace the water before any corrosion can happen. If no components have died due to a  short, you'll be able to clean it with iso and an optional ultrasonic bath and you'll be fine.
Whereas if you leave the shit on there in a rice bath for 2 fucking weeks, your devices PCB will look like someone came all over it and then topped it off with fucking rice dust.
Watch the video's in my edited comment. They're a good watch.

It's not going to cross 10k this week. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 15:45:09
That's not for me, though. It's for your own safety.

Elliot wave 5 is complete. We'll have a downtrend the next few months and will be going back up from Jan/Feb on. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 09:46:51
This. It does nothing to water damage. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 10:54:06


What? No. Corrosion happens regardless of any power running through the board. It is a natural process.
However the chance of damaged components due to shorts will be minized when you take the power away. The corrosion still might eat through components and connections and create other shorts and dead leads, though. Which is why you shouldn't dry it out.

What? There's lots of money to be made shorting btc.

The real information on crypto is on discord and slack.
This sub is just 90% hodlerjerking.
There. I said it.

An entry into bear market is defined by a 20% downturn across all markets over a period of 2 months. 
Crypto is definitely in a bear market and that is an undeniable fact.

Let's have a bit of hopium in this thread:

It gives you a statistical advantage over the market.
@_date: 2018-03-15 07:55:57
We got pushed to 20k. We didn't stay long enough under 10k to form any stable base to below 5000.
We only were around 9k for a few days even.
