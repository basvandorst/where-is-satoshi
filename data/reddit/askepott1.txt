I was looking into the history of printed Tethers today and couldn't find data. Maybe you have a link?
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:17:43
There is the drama about Bitfinex and USDT connection where USDT is printed out of thin air and used as a hedge vs. crypto's. This is because USD, EUR or other currencies are not accepted by Bitfinex due to their inability to comply with KYC practices that standard banking requires. So they made their own token that they will not exchange for for an internationally accepted currency BUT in crypto they hold value. So if the 'real' market trend would be want to be bearish but a bot would trade USDT for BTC at the right moments, crazy things like this 19k spike could happen. In MtGox there were bots that did wash trading and all sorts of nasty stuff. Human greed is universal.

It's possible Bitfinex have the funds in tainted money. If true and left unchecked, they could continue funneling illegal fiat/drug money/etc. into the crypto ecosystem which in turn would inflate it. The only problem is legality of such an efficient system.

Considering the fact that bitmex has significant server overload issues, I believe that this is ignorance from bitmex, maybe even outright manipulation of data.
I saw first hand how someones inconvenient chat messages were deleted one by one because the chat admin didn't like them.
And really... What kind of a financial business offers no liability for issues stemming from their own system (overload, etc.). When you see that your tactic isn't working out, you'd try to place a market order to prevent from being liquidated, right? Well, placing this order is often impossible because of overload issues while liquidation engine works just fine.

I have most of my savings in Bitcoin. I love it. I know that I might lose it all but that is a possibility, not a given. The other part of my savings that's in the bank, well.. Every year I lose a big chunk of that buying power due to inflation, the bank charges percentage fee for withdrawals over 700 EUR per month even though they use my money to give out loans and do other stuff as they please, without giving me anything in return. Now the bank (Swedbank) is involved in dirty money scandal and who knows what the next economic downturn will bring.
It is my opinion that my money in Bitcoin is safer than the one which sits at the bank account. I would love to ditch the bank entirely.

Don't know whether it's the new version at fault but Bisq has a critical [issue]( where a 5% deposit on a 0.01 BTC transaction doesn't work - the deposit is calculated as 10 % in effect.
Please fix this issue, BISQ developers!
@_date: 2019-03-19 17:23:17
Can't attest if it's a fact or not but that's my opinion as the central bank's website states that only currency emitted by them is allowed to be used for purchase as legal tender.
Like I said in the other comment, will go to the local pub this week to see how they implemented Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-03-19 08:17:18
Like someone already said, people need incentives. Banking industry is getting people onboard the "digital currency" bandwagon because businesses are charging extra when people want to pay in cash. Use this kind of logic to offer a better deal if people pay with Bitcoin.
As an aside, could you share how Denmark tax authority views transactions in Bitcoin? In Latvia our tax authority views BTC as a capital good, therefore disallows transacting goods for capital goods (i.e. they require the goods to be sold in fiat first, then converted to BTC and vice versa). We are a fiscal country though, so that sucks.
I recently worked at a local tech company which specializes in POS systems and such and the curious thing is that our tax authority uses sort of a blockchain to verify receipts. Each receipt is put through the SHA function and it's checksum must be part of the next transaction. This is pretty much what happens in Bitcoin blockchain.
@_date: 2019-03-19 10:50:05
That would work I guess but.. Bitcoin is not legal tender here. I'm going to the local pub where supposedly you can pay in coins. Will ask around how they manage that.

Be that as it may, try BISQ. Sure beats using exchanges.
@_date: 2019-03-19 08:11:07
Try BISQ.network. It's a DAO (Decentralized Autonomous Organization) that facilitates sale of Bitcoin/Cash between private people with an arbitrator in case one of the parties wants to scam the other. Haven't tried it myself yet but looks promising and doesn't need KYC.
  
P.S. - This is the worst time to sell (bottom or close to bottom of the market cycle).

What we need is for people to stop putting the product of their work in large institutions (cartel of banks) in order for them to fail once and for all. That will cause instant adoption all over the world in a cascading fashion.
When banks will fail, politics will be changed forever for the better. But we have to have the crash to fix the malinvestment, corruption, leveraging and all the other shortcomings of "modern economics".

aidanlister, I have tried a couple times to perform a charge-back through a bank to no avail (Swedbank which, until recent fiasco, was one of the most trustworthy banks). Recently someone did an illegal charge from my debit card and even then the bank didn't return the amount stolen, but rather made me pay for a new card to be shipped overseas as I was in another country.
So, in my personal experience, zero protection.

Actually most people seem to be convinced it's going down, hence the ever so decreasing price against fiat. 
But really the market is not sure what to make of itself at this point. The dollar is still strong for now and the equity market is still not in freefall. December will have BAKT (market for institutional investors), FED increasing rates in US and maybe even an ETF.
@_date: 2018-11-14 18:37:30
Consider the following situation: person/companyA owns a truckload of Bitcoin, then sells it OTC to some whale who then dumps it on an exchange. Price tanks, he buys back at a discount. If he doesn't buy back, price stays at the same low.
Then there are the leveraged shorters who borrow to short the coin...

u/Miskav \+1 for bikepacking. When I'm feeling very sick of the daily grind, I also dream about vanlife, living on a sailboat, going 'survival mode' in the forest or - the latest idea - going on a perpetual trip with a bicycle.
Right now I'm in a happy relationship and have immediate career plans but shit might change in an instant, very much like Bitcoin does sometimes.
The bottom line is that you are not alone, many people I've met feel alienated in today's society and wish to work less and enjoy the simple things in life more. Some need to run away (to come back later), but all of us need to come to grips with the world that we live in. Bikepacking might be just the experience to mellow you out.

Though it has never been hacked, there was an exploit found recently which could allow a malicious miner to create unlimited supply of Bitcoin. It has since been fixed in latest Bitcoin Core versions but scary nevertheless. Older clients still have this exploit. And, as many altcoins are forks of Bitcoin, they too have the [exploit](

Facebook is the worst thing that happened to Oculus because they will want to 'socialize' the user base. IMHO, it will only survive this acquisition if it leaves Oculus management alone to do it's job.
Valve, on the other hand, is in the gaming business and, as such, is complimentary to the industry.
It's all relative to the perception of the consumer though. A great example is the iPhone. What's so special about it in contrast to Android phones? Apple's marketing in tandem with people's vanity. When VR heavyweights will find a way to socially reach a new user base other than well-paid gamers, it will lift off. Calling the sum of many years of work by different industry professionals stagnant is ignorant to say the least, considering that VR already at it's current stage achieves it's purpose - immersion. Have you actually tried a VR headset?

That's what I'm doing. I just added to my long @ 6k something and don't really care that much if it goes down in the short term. Learned my lesson not to daytrade last year, haha.
But really there is not much sense in keeping your money in fiat as it's getting more weak by the year. Bitcoin doesn't belong to any one government or organization, therefore I can be sure that I will be able to use it wherever and whenever I want to as I memorized my recovery seed and burned the paper.
It's just a matter of letting go of the indoctrination that fiat is the only thing that really has "value". Nobody can take away your Bitcoin, provided you have the private key.

I think people will move their fiat into Bitcoin when fiat starts to go down and there are no alternatives. Dollar has been strong so long that nobody even has a clue that it's worthless paper without a solid foundation (gold standard). It just takes a black swan event to put things into perspective.
At this moment people are just jittery and hope that keeping their assets in cash will somehow save them.

He said "as soon as it's regulated", so his dreams are going to break as Bitcoin was made precisely to be not regulated. Regulation is the problem which you can clearly understand if you compare the 1920/21 crisis that could've brought USA down to the Great Depression which, due to government intervention, made a lot of people poor as fuck for many years to come.

There's a reason why the rich stay rich and poor stay poor. It's really tough to go against the crowd, be it your s.o., mom, friends, economists or fellow redditors. Common sense says that they must be right because the market reflects their thoughts but common sense is not so common (Voltaire).

Judging from your past comments, you are a very negative person, so don't see a reason to argue with you any longer. As a final note I'll add that inflation hasn't risen in hyper mode only due to USD status as a reserve currency (for the n'th time, please learn to read), thus circulating around the globe. As soon as it's all going to go back to the local economy, prices are going to rise proportionally to the circulating USD note sum, triggering hyperinflation just like in Germany after WW1, only there the hyperinflation was triggered by people suddenly starting to spend their savings. As soon as retailers realized that the money supply vastly overshadows product supply, they started increasing the prices. This led to continuous printing in order for people to be able to afford basic food staples and for the economy to function at all. 
At the end the central bank couldn't print enough, so it allowed municipalities to help print money. Inflation was so rapid that they ran out of paper. As a result they even had notes on pieces of clothing and even wood. 
This time governments are smarter and therefore either repatriating the gold they own from US in exchange for soon to be worthless USD or buying up whatever they can so that their currencies actually have some value later on.
But you keep your paper money, dummy.
@_date: 2018-11-19 14:42:17
I guess a lot of nation stations are dumb then because they're soaking it up like candy. If you follow finance news, you should already be aware that a lot of noteworthy people agree that the general sentiment is that USD is losing it's ground as reserve currency in the world. What might take it's place? Bitcoin can, but majority of old-timers still see gold being the intrinsic value which will reflect fiat's worthlessness when push comes to shove (hyper inflation).
The trends in price of the last 10 or even 20 years don't matter much. The massive influx of new fiat has made people comfortably dumb regarding real valuations of equity, real estate and bond markets. They have no idea why gold has survived every single currency that has ever existed (and there have been more than 5000).
I guess every generation has to learn what value and debt means on their own.

If people are not selling (no liquidity at particular price) and more people want to buy, the price will go up very fast because the nearest sell orders will be at a much higher price than what the buyer expects. Same in the other direction - more people selling than people buying - price tanks.

I also sold at somewhere from 11 to 12k. My non-crypto literate s.o. followed my tracks and made a nice profit on a small investment. Seeing the price go up, we both felt a bit bad for a day, but then she asked me if she should: 
Pay the last of her PhD student debt or invest it in Bitcoin considering the way price is still going up;   
I recommended to pay the student debt and she was very happy that she made the right choice. BUT... that inner voice which prompted her to invest again is the fear of missing out which most people experienced. Ffs, I heard talk of Bitcoin everywhere I went. At the local tattoo shop, at work and on the news. I even made 200 USD by trading in between my 2 hour tattoo session. :D
Now most of them normies are in the loss and hence looking for others to blame when the only one to blame are themselves. First mistake was to buy when everyone is buying and the second was to sell when everyone was selling.

When Bitcoin falls down sufficiently and recovers for the next wave of craziness, then we'll see the real price of transactions.

I invested a bit over 7k during the last month. It's not the greatest feeling to see it go down but managable. I'm a smoker, so I calculated that if I quit smoking, my investment (in case Bitcoin goes to 0) will pay back in 7.7 years.
So, in 7.7 years I will look back at this as one of the greatest investments in my life (Nr. 1 was LASIK corrective surgery which also had significant risk) because I will be a non-smoker with a longer lifespan than if I hadn't done it. And maybe there will be a financial return as well.

Bitcoin's intrinsic value is it's community. Why it will succeed over shitcoins is the same reason why big corporates buy successful startups. Not because they couldn't innovate themselves, but rather because they are buying the userbase. And the userbase currently is in Bitcoin. 
Each crypto has a chance to succeed, but the Lindy effect states that the future of something is proportional to it's past lifetime length up to the moment where it's measured (now).

We are many billion on this rock, but we cannot repair our shortcomings in government, big business, law and other areas for the life of us. It is because it's very hard to mobilize for action en masse. With this in mind, the large market capitalization of crypto markets is irrelevant much the same way it is irrelevant how many people there are in the mob during an uprising as, at that point, it has a life of it's own. Police knows this and tends to separate large crowds in more manageable chunks despite their inferior numbers. Their sticks, sprays and other "toys" have an amazing effect in the same way how 2000BTC orders work in exchanges. People DO chase those and, when someone wash-trades, they DO disappear from the order book, leaving most "holding the bags".
As an aside here's an interesting observation I made in retrospect: when I first started trading, I did so on Bitmex testnet. Granted, it has unreal dynamics compared to the real BTCEUR orderbook but I learned a lot and even increased my holdings more than ten times. Soon I realized that, because there were so few orders, I could manipulate the market by placing counter-intuitive large bets and buying/selling back at a discount. And so why shouldn't some band of morality-resistant fat fingers not try to pump and dump?
Bitcoin market is illiquid because there isn't anyone guaranteeing that withdrawals or deposits will always be filled. Bitcoin can jump thousands in minutes and any exchange can and would pause client operations in case of a meltdown.
Whatever it may be, I'm not aware of an audit on Coinbase. US tax authorities do have a lot of customer data, according to news, therefore they probably have interest in the firm's balances as well. Besides, Coinbase uses EUR/USD, not USDT or the planned EURT and YENT. If BTC would crash like this and you held in EUR in your Coinbase account, they would have to pay you back in full. Tether TOS say USDT is toy money and is not redeemable.

Do you mean to say that, for example, your hardware wallet of Bitcoin is a flag on the border? I imagine it would be if training of airport authorities included the concept of crypto-currencies, but surely this is much easier to circumvent than with fiat or precious metals. My idea is the following: Get a hardware wallet, memorize the passphrase, create a fake wallet for plausible deniability and travel happy. If you get flagged and coerced to show the contents of the wallet, no blame can be passed unto you. If the device gets confiscated, you just recover your wallet as soon as you are able to access the network in the target country.
This would insure your crypto assets while a crackdown on exchanges as seen in China is harder to circumvent. Then again, in this digital age someone will always find a way. I hope, at least.

IMHO, this shouldn't be viewed as an investment. It is a utility with a future promise of use. Not yet that much relevant in developed countries but high inflation in places like Venezuela, Argentina and Ukraine is creeping ever so closer to us. At one point people might just think that trading goods and services for Bitcoin serves them better. 
How much each Bitcoin or satoshi is worth in fiat will be irrelevant at this point. All that's really necessary for this to work is for multiple parties to agree that this is a valid medium of exchange.
