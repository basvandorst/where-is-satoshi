I was interested in the BTC to USD exchanges. I have written on the Chinese exchanges before.

No, it was bitcoin from my Blockchain wallet. The vendor was using a Coinbase wallet though.

That's a fair criticism, but Mastercoin is built specifically as a platform to do these crowdsales and has nine more in the works. Of those, this was the "first."

Thanks for that. I will add this in an update. Though, even in the event of the double-spend, it is true I spent the money at least once.

I'm shocked someone tech-savvy enough to be involved in Bitcoin doesn't use an ad blocker. But thank you for consuming ads and supporting publishers!

How do I get blockchain.info to do that automatically in the app?

There was no one to fight for or defend the Silk Road and its funds. The site doesn't have its own lawyers and Ross Ulbricht says he isn't Dread Pirate Roberts and doesn't represent the site (though he is fighting to keep the 144,000 BTC found on his computer -- those haven't been forfeited yet). The anonymity around the site means it has no legal protectors.
The real losers here are the Silk Road users who just forfeited whatever they had sitting in the site's coffers. Even if someone made the unwise decision to come forward and say, 'I used the site legally and that's my money,' the feds could still say it was a site devoted mainly to illegal activity and so that argument is moot.

Author, interviewer here. Loved that guy. He was definitely fully aware of his own weirdness. But damn, he had timed market well, starting to buy big in January 2013. So planets must know what they're talking about.

Not presenting MaidSafeCoin as a disaster, just pointing out that crowdsale left MaidSafe with "millions" in a cryptocoin they can't cash out and left would-be investors holding Mastercoin they couldn't turn into Safecoin and couldn't cash out. There were definitely losers here who didn't play the trading game right, which is not usually an aspect of a successful crowd sale.

I actually try to cover angles that other people are not covering. I think I've tended to be ahead of/writing about different parts of Bitcoin than most of the mainstream media. I think diversity or lack there of in the start-up community around Bitcoin is a valid point to raise.
@_date: 2014-05-17 18:25:04
I got a $26 store credit, but yeah that sucked. Bitcoin still better for online purchases than offline ones, though that shouldn't ultimately be the case.
@_date: 2014-10-01 19:00:44
how does this only have 3 comments?
@_date: 2014-06-26 18:51:58
That's why I headlined it "bitcoin economy" not "bitcoin."
@_date: 2014-05-17 18:23:42
same here.
@_date: 2014-06-26 18:47:06
Bitpay does. Given that Coinbase's price is usually Bitstamp's, make a reasonable assumption.

Hello Reddit. I wrote this piece that many of you hate. I admit the headline was glib. I revisited the piece this morning to add more about why I chose it. 
Here's that elaboration: My headline has caused an uproar on Twitter so I’d like to elaborate on it. The wider Bitcoin community does have diversity, though it has been noted at conferences I’ve attended that many of the people on panels tend to be — in the parlance of my headline — “white dudes.” The lack of diversity was especially prevalent it would seem among the early adopters and movers of Bitcoin interviewed and profiled in the film — those heading BitInstant, Tradehill, Coinbase, Silk Road, Bitpay, BitAngels, SatoshiDice/Coinapult, Mt. Gox, and Bitcoin’s core development team — thus my headline. It’s not the first time the lack of gender diversity has been commented on. I realize ethnicity is a contentious subject. Yes, Bobby Lee — who is Chinese — is interviewed in the film, as the head of BTC China. But the only black person interviewed is a drug dealer using Silk Road, who talks about the benefits of moving from the street to the Internet to run his operations. That reinforces some disturbing stereotypes, and was actually rather surprising to me, as most of those busted for dealing on Silk Road have been white. Those out there arguing that the Bitcoin community is more diverse than my headline implies have a point — but when it comes to the “major players in the space in Bitcoin’s early days”, diversity was lacking. You can completely ignore that and be “colorblind” or use it to have a deeper conversation about why diversity was lacking, what role it played in accelerating or hindering Bitcoin’s development, or why start-ups with different leaders didn’t become Bitcoin’s power players.
Even today, decades into the "Internet," we are still having conversations about the lack of diversity in Silicon Valley. Why not start those conversations earlier in the development of a technology? Those early adopters and their friends will remain the power players years from now. If you have diversity now, you will have diversity later.

It did eventually go through. Took 67 minutes to confirm.

That tends to be the nature of auctions. Sure the auction is a tremendous source of liquidity but I doubt people will pay above market for it.

Disclosure: Author of piece. This piece is partly about access. Bitfinex isn't talking to journalists. Bitstamp's being a top exchange over 6 months is telling especially with other exchanges' rapid rises and falls. I hadn't seen an I depth piece about Bitstamp done yet and thought it was worth telling how they scrambled to the top of the heap and stayed there.

Just the fact that the fee is high enough to negate the advantages of Bitcoin. And the fact that you have to submit a palm print while withdrawing and depositing.

Yes. My friends also would have treated me to coffee and normal food all week, but this article is trying to capture what it would be like to be limited to Bitcoin financial transactions not how generous my friends are.

hmmm. this feels a little like a cheat. i'm trying to stick to paying for real goods with bitcoin as opposed to simply converting it to a different currency.

Great. How about Monday or Tuesday?

I've certainly never been given that much money by enthusiastic communities I've reported on before (as when I immersed myself in the Quantified Self community). The point of my article is not to make Bitcoin seem ridiculous, but to see how it functions in the real world of commerce. To be given $1000 worth of virtual currency over three days for just doing my job makes it seem like play money. The BTC tips feel like Reddit karma instead of real money.

ever figure out why it didn't work? I didn't have any problem with my wallet later that day.

this why it would've been a good idea for Mt. Gox to have gone through with the CoinLab partnership. CoinLab is all good with the FinCEN licensing requirements.

I was half kidding, but it would make his story more believable. 
Ways for him to find it if he doesn't have a link somewhere: If he ever actually used his Bitcoin and sent it to a publicly identified address/one he remembers, he could track it back to his public wallet depending on what kind of Bitcoin hygiene he had. Or if he ever sent Bitcoin to someone he knows without generating a unique wallet for the transaction, he could contact that person to track the activity back to his wallet.

That's reasonable. What kind of bike?

theoretically they could copy the code and issue their own Fedcoin version, but yeah, would be a question of who would want to use it.
