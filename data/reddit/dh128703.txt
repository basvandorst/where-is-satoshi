What if you can treat it like a gift to my friend. How will it be taxed then?
@_date: 2019-06-17 16:15:16
So he has to pay taxes at whichever slab he comes under?

Then how do you pay taxes. I mean how is it calculated. Supposing I'm selling btc worth 5k USD. How much tax should I be paying and where should I mention it in the w2 form?

It is not working. I'm stuck at verify your identity.

Trying to. But the way it's dipping. Can't handle it mate.

I'll tell you one thing. Have you heard of a book called "In the name of God" by Ravi Subramanian? Read it mate. You'll get an idea why this nirav modi scam had surfaced way long back. But stupid PMO office was so busy covering up their buddies asses. This issue was supposed to burst out last year but because of Gujarat elections they tried suppressing the news. And finally it's out.

God damn I'm literally shitting my pants right now. I've invested more than I could afford to lose and I bought at 16k. What do I do :|

LMFAO. How can you be so blindsided mate. Even some of his own party people are openly bashing him after GST, demonization and nirav modi scam. Bhakts never cease to amaze me. ��
