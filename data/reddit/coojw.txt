Gold is backed by itself. Gold is the base currency on earth. You don't want to go down this rabbit hole. lol

There is a new interesting coin poised to challenge bitcoin in the coming years. It is the first cryptocurrency backed by physical gold bullion (not gold contracts, futures etc).
You can trade every 100 of the coin for 1 gram of gold. Quite an interesting notion. I guess what is most interesting, is if you do the math, gold being $45 per gram right now, if you buy 100 of their coin, its only $5-$6. I feel like this will blow up once the world at large learns about it.

Bitcoin has its place in history, but it doesn't change the fact that it is a fiat currency with a 10 year track record of volatility and a value backing largely based on people's belief that it has value, having no hard asset backing it like all other fiat currencies. It is an amazing innovation built on an amazing technology, but I see it being overshadowed in the years to come by better innovations using the same blockchain technology.

Physical Gold is on the blockchain now (i know you're thinking, "wait what?") Its an ingenious system.
@_date: 2019-07-07 16:33:13
I disagree completely. The world right now is running on unbacked money. Its called fiat money. Bitcoin ushered in a new era of money technology through blockchain, but bitcoin itself is only backed by an algorithm which creates its scarcity. Though a novel idea, it is not the worlds base money, gold.

Do you have a stake in the US economy? Do you work? Yes? No? Are you an American? Well he wants to give you and every other stake holder in the economy a dividend. The country in which you elect officials to govern should be for your and our benefit, not your and our detriment. He wants to lift everyone up.

the company started out as a gold company in 2011, and started its crypto offering in 2018. They have 3 mines and 0 debt, i'd say its a fair assumption.

Gold backed cryptocurrency (digital gold), and its physical form "Cash gold" (paper money with gold embedded). They are universally interchangable, and easy to pay digitally with or physically.
@_date: 2019-11-10 23:00:24
dont buy gold minted by a country, you don't truly own those, the country does, you are only the bearer of the coin. Buy international sovereign gold bullion. Gold not owned by any country. You truly own that one. It cannot be confiscated legally this way.
I buy these:

If you would have bought an ICO package from the Karatcoin ICO, a gold backed crypto (featured by forbes top 10 cryptos to watch in 2019). For their €4,000 ICO package, you receive 100% of the coins you bought, then a bonus of 120% on top of that of your initial outlay, plus 13 grams of gold (total of €8,800 euros worth of a gold-backed crypto that can be exchanged for gold at a rate of 100 coins for 1 gram of gold, and you would've received $617.50 worth of pure 24k gold)
Just letting you know whats out there.

I'm buying gold backed crypto, its made me 49K this year.
@_date: 2019-11-24 10:58:42
So many people get this wrong. It's not necessarily Bitcoin that will do any of these things for us, it is the blockchain. Bitcoin MAY be the solution, but not necessarily. Bitcoin is the first, but people will iterate and improve, and some other blockchain solution may be the solution. People assume its bitcoin.

Bitcoin is the father of a revolution in the way the world works by introducing blockchain. It was first, but it didn't do it best. It will be innovated upon, which is a good thing for everyone.

@_date: 2019-12-02 18:29:00
Actually, it has both digital scarcity, and the worlds oldest and safest store of value, married into one. Everyone 100 coins is exchangable for gold bullion. There is no fractional reserve banking with gold of course.

BTC won't replace gold.
@_date: 2019-12-02 03:32:25
personally, i think bitcoin lead the way for others to do it better. KBC for example, is a gold backed coin, backed by physical gold bullion. It is the token for use on their entire gold backed ecosystem.
@_date: 2019-12-02 18:34:09
Fair criticism (and I can certainly forgive you for not being totally awake, sometimes I operate in that space all day lol). KBC is decentralized just as BTC is. It takes the strengths of cryptocurrency, and the strengths of gold, and combines the two. Every 100 coins is exchangeable for gold bullion if you so choose, or you can hold the coin. The coin is also the token used within the eco system of products as the medium of exchange (Products include, a decentralized blockchain based smartphone where all data/calls/texts are decentralized, encrypted, and secure via the blockchain so no 3rd party can eavesdrop, or steal data, Blockchain laptop .. same idea as the phone, an atm that puts out paper notes with embedded gold in them which makes its value whatever the value of the gold on the note is, a crypto exchange, soon to be a stock exchange.) This company is making moves.

Most people here are in the camp of, BTC will replace gold. Others in other areas are like, BTC is useless, a fad, gold will always be better than BTC.
I'm in the camp of, taking the best of what BTC brings to the table, with the long term stability that gold brings to the table, and mixing it. That's why I'm all in on a gold bullion-backed crypto.
@_date: 2019-12-03 03:29:07
I don't listen to anyone's talking points on any kind of media, this is from observation.
@_date: 2019-12-03 04:20:37
I agree crypto has a place for the future of finance, I just don't think Bitcoin is the best choice, nor the only choice for safety. Gold is the obvious safe bet as it has always been, but my choice is gold-backed crypto. A crypto thats exchangeable for gold.

Karatgold already created the worlds first cryptocurrency bank, and its coins are gold backed.
@_date: 2019-09-02 07:38:36
Or we can get behind the worlds first gold bullion backed cryptocurrency by Karatbars International. Every 100 coins is exchangeable for 1 gram of physical gold. All the pros of gold &amp; crypto.
