Not one bit, price is way to volatile. When it sticks for 6+ months around the same price then maybe..
@_date: 2014-01-25 17:25:12
Yes, that is what I meant. A tax refund. It provides disposable income that could give people wanting to get into bitcoin a chance to do it. 
@_date: 2014-01-25 19:28:52
I was going in more for a more people buy, meaning more people likely to use, more companies accept bitcoin... etc. I've been watching the bitcoin scene closely but havnt seen this many work colleagues and friends interested in trying it out. 
@_date: 2014-03-21 17:02:13
Please post your site on btcpages.com !
@_date: 2014-01-12 16:29:22
Thanks! Changing the style of that. I appreciate the comments. 
@_date: 2014-03-19 23:57:50
wow cant believe I forgot the site haha I added it into the post
@_date: 2014-01-12 14:16:26
They make sense for this, its easier to find bitcoin accepting people this way. This also serves for an easy lookup for contact info, reviews, etc. 
@_date: 2013-10-26 12:58:29
You should add it to the free directory here:

Switch to a better miner? Go to reaper or one of the many out there that are better. 
@_date: 2013-07-03 16:31:10
We redesigned the theme, and looking for a partner to help make this a better site!
@_date: 2013-10-20 21:54:27
What does everyone think of this site? What would you change, improve... What features would you like to see?

From my perspective, it takes about 1 minute to write a 2 sentence review. If you sat and wrote reviews for an hour you are making a decent salary. (better than any minimum wage job) Also its not always about money you are helping users know what sites are good/bad, and you are also helping listings get recognition.
@_date: 2013-11-15 16:09:48
We also have a newer category structure, and working on an even more powerful search. We also have almost 120 categories and almost 100 reviews! Plus removed 2 ad's from the homepage, and other ad's around the site to make it cleaner. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 21:02:47
I started a Bitcoin Directory a year ago thats more complete, and better features  and is 100% free. 
@_date: 2013-11-10 20:43:07
We are beginning planning for V4 to better help this extremely fast growing community. If anyone can recommend a good but cost effective SEO company or contractor please reach out! 
Also feedback would be great last time we made so many improvements when people pointed out everything that could be better or changed. 
@_date: 2013-11-10 20:56:35
There is top right Corner, the little search Icon and the shadowed search text. It is AJAX so it will pull up results as it finds them or just type what you want and hit enter. Do you think that I should make it more prominent? 
@_date: 2013-04-23 15:38:57
We are trying our best and look for feedback wherever possible! The amazon of bitcoin is probably one of these guys:
@_date: 2013-06-05 21:12:23
A few years ago that was the case, now a days it is based on a variety of factors. PR has become a useless ranking and metric. PR doesn't correlate with how high your site is on google or really much anymore. 
@_date: 2013-04-18 15:53:38
Thanks and yes you can add listing's by going to the categories on the right and click add listing, it will prompt you to make an account, also the post needs to be approved (to prevent spam).
@_date: 2013-03-27 21:41:22
I think you missed the point entirely. Its more based on risk. For me turning a decent profit and getting out on top is an acceptable outcome. The fact that so many threats (that are for the most part ignored in bitcoin debates) exist is what I'm trying to get at. 
@_date: 2013-03-27 23:10:49
Even if it gets a lot of downvotes I am still happy to learn from some of the constructive comments.
@_date: 2013-10-21 12:04:06
OpenStreetMap Data seems like a huge improvement over the current mapping tech. I'll take a look at it. 
@_date: 2013-04-04 03:23:39
With all the fears of hacking with current NFC, I don't think its an effective method, at least not yet.
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:16:28
I think we will see this explode once an easier way to obtain bitcoins for the average user. Bitcoin ATM's are a great start but there needs to be more solutions. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 19:39:43
This is just about bitcoin, has been around for awhile and adding more listings daily. We have almost 100+ reviews and adding more features. This is a great place if you want to support bitcoins and learn, and buy from merchants who accept bitcoin. A easy place to find what you are looking for. 
@_date: 2013-04-23 15:40:21
I have a reseller account and will be btc to sell domain names/ssl/other things after I get more time.
@_date: 2013-07-19 14:03:49
Largest free BTC directory: 
@_date: 2013-11-09 00:23:54
Weird thing is it did have the standard .0005
@_date: 2013-04-18 18:47:20
Making a section called merchants. 
@_date: 2013-11-15 16:45:43
Thanks, yeah anonymous reviews would be a good idea. But why should you fear saying BFL is a scam... everyone knows that. As for App's there are so many that It's been hard plus keeping track of other categories, and more. 
I just made reviews anonymous, and open to the public!
@_date: 2013-04-23 15:38:25
Thanks we are adding more listings everyday and trying out new tech to improve site usability and features
@_date: 2013-04-18 18:47:04
Sorry guys registration issue has been fixed for everyone PM'ing me.
@_date: 2013-07-27 18:53:11
Should add it to  one the largest free btc directories on the web! 
@_date: 2013-06-27 14:51:09
I did the same yesterday and it worked flawlessly. 
@_date: 2013-07-11 22:01:01
You should post it to: 
@_date: 2013-07-31 01:10:02
I wouldn't touch bitfury, knc, and others until they start shipping product. It seems they all have promised deadlines but we don't want another BFL situation. 
@_date: 2013-04-21 21:59:19
I am working on a fraud reporting system now that I hope will combine well with the listings in the directory. Bitcoin deserves to have a strong reputation with a strong user/company base. We need to set standards and hold those accountable. I am glad to provide all these services free of charge as a stronger btc is the future. 
@_date: 2013-06-29 04:09:46
Seems to have disappeared
@_date: 2013-07-12 00:53:46
I activated your account for some reason you didn't get the email. You should be good to go to log in!
@_date: 2013-04-18 15:32:00
Just launched this site and adding websites as we speak. More features to come. 
Edit: also ad free, simple clean interface. 
@_date: 2013-04-23 15:39:27
We have a mapping feature in the works but right now we are restricting it to online business at the moment till we figure out the best possible way to categorize physical locations. 
@_date: 2013-04-18 21:30:07
Thanks, I approved it and switched it to the games directory. I'm continuing to improve the site as we speak. It's been less then 24 hours and almost 40 listings.
@_date: 2013-06-05 19:05:57
PR means absolutely nothing anymore, and its a brand new site a few months old. 
@_date: 2013-07-30 02:34:20
I can also vouch it worked for me using google wallet. 
@_date: 2013-05-02 03:32:55
Now above 150+ listings!
@_date: 2013-04-26 16:17:06
We are over 140 and almost at 150 listings in the directory!
@_date: 2013-08-09 11:55:34
Should share on btcpages.net !
@_date: 2013-06-26 15:12:36
Hey you should list it in the largest free btc directory: 
@_date: 2013-04-23 15:39:45
Awesome we look forward to the improved traffic! Also looking forward to working with the BBB further. 
@_date: 2013-04-24 21:52:54
Spending $150 in adwords credit on advertising the site for businesses to sign up. Which in turn produces more views for companies that have listed their business. Its a giant win win for everyone honestly.
@_date: 2013-11-16 02:13:42
Thanks I will.
