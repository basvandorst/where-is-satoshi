People assume everyone posting is a guy. If you do say you're a girl, or you have a feminine screen name you'll get all sorts of shit. Guys don't experience that. Defending behavior by saying "Pretend to be a dude" isn't really a great argument.

Marketing in the bitcoin sphere is pretty abysmal, and not that many engineers understand what marketing *is* or why it's important. This counts double for start ups. (I handled marketing and biz dev for a large bitcoin site for almost a year. The founders DID realize they needed marketing help and the business was better off for it).

Agreed. The name is stupid and makes me cringe a bit.

How do you think you're going to communicate those strengths to the community? Are you communicating them effectively? Is public perception affecting your revenue? Marketing is about building your business and creating an effective brand, and if you have no one on your team thinking about that, you're putting yourself at a competitive disadvantage. That might be fine in the early stages, but what happens later? People with tech backgrounds usually don't understand what marketing is or how it can help. I also disagree that you need someone in the top 5%, you just need someone knowledgeable and creative who will work hard.

People that aren't compulsive gamblers do. If you have an addictive personality you shouldn't gamble at all.

Never gamble more than you can afford to lose. Treat it like an entertainment expense.
