That may be the case, but did you hear that Sony's Betamax isn't doing so well in the format war? ;)

According to blockchain, it took 73 minutes for that transaction to confirm.
@_date: 2014-10-06 16:40:17
Is that so.
Thank you for informing of this latest and greatest development within this "byte coin" thing, soon we will be able to have it on our nokia 8210's and use some sort of barcode to make things quicker.
Now, where did i park my delorean?

Got a similar problem, apart from the whole KYC stuff.
They disabled my ability to withdraw bitcoins, and support claims to have no idea why this is the case.
I verified as a business with them about 6 months ago, and have sent over £500k over that time, and it has been fine up until now.
If it was a case of having to reverify, then great, I wouldn't have a problem in doing it due to the amount of money that changes hands, but seeing as they claim that i don't need to reverify, they are basically holding my money hostage until something happens.
Starting to feel like i've been goxed :/

Funny how Apple supporters are starting to realise what the rest of the world has known for the last 10 years, at least.
@_date: 2014-04-25 16:05:54
Cause anyone can buy btc, then claim they sent it to the wrong account, and get their money back.

Next time, check your address before putting login details in.
The recent one that's on google (as a paid ad) is DONT.CLICK.

If only there was another site where this could be done.
Like Reddit, but made with Frontpage Express.

Dear Enron, 
I've been trying to call your offices for the past year with no answer!
What sort of company are you trying to run here!?
@_date: 2014-04-17 19:16:46
That too :)
@_date: 2014-01-23 22:42:37
Didn't know there was a Bitcoin credit card...
@_date: 2015-01-13 14:34:46
At least it FINALLY has a confirmation, still got to bitch at bs for using a utxo, idiots.
@_date: 2015-01-13 13:50:11
Already done, waiting for them to wake up and deal with it.

Having someone from the inner sanctum of the banking world ejaculate it's cancerous tendrils deep into the arse of bitcoin, is a huge win?
"Hitler's brain to run for office in German elections IS A HUGE WIN for diversity!"

Seems like it's only for people that haven't used them in a while.
I know 2 people who got the email that haven't used them since January, so maybe regular customers have been left by the wayside.

And how would that help?
Or should we just assume you're spamming?

Dear HMRC,
While you are deciding on what classification bitcoin should get, feel free to click the above link.

Minutes if you send it via faster payments.

If you have converted over £79k of btc into fiat without being a business, VAT is the least of your problems.
Being the next Jimmy Carr is the more likely outcome.

My point was, the earth isn't going to crash into the sun, as the sun will expand, meaning the sun will crash into the earth.
Disagreeing with this will mean you accept someone crashing into your parked car = your fault.
@_date: 2013-12-10 11:35:01
"the earth will crash into the sun"
Please explain how this would happen.
@_date: 2013-12-12 17:22:47
Over 9000!

So, the sun will crash into the earth, not the other way round...
Hence wanting an explanation on how the earth will suddenly lose orbital speed, causing it to orbit closer to the sun, and eventually crash into the sun.

I send daily payments to bitstamp with no issue's from barclays.
If you almost emptied out your account with the transfer, then that would be why they froze it, but if not, i have no ideas why.
