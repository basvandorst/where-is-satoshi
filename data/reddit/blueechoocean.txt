Freaked me out.

Don’t use history and logic. Bitcoin is going to really die next time it drops.

I was skeptical of the quality of the video at first, but it turned out to be really good. It has a lot of good, recent interview excerpts.

Agree to disagree my fellow

It’s very very good. Moon time bay bae

What year is that chart from?
Edit: The chart was published on July 19, 2019

This is a stupid question, and maybe I should be in r/investing asking this, but I hear this all the time and I’m confused about it.
So when people say, “recession, stocks have plummeted and have become cheap, this is the time to buy cheap stocks and profit ...”
What does that mean? In the sense that, do you buy individual company stocks in that situation? Like shares of cheap apple stock or cheap [insert company here] stock?
Or are they referencing buying s&amp;p 500 index fund holdings? I guess what confuses me is that I’ve come to the conclusion that index funds are the best thing to buy now, but do index funds make more money during a recession in the same way that individual stocks do?
Edit: As I’m sitting here thinking about this, I’m realizing that this is probably the answer: when you put money into an s&amp;p 500 index fund, you are really just buying actual shares of the company, it’s just all clumped together into the value. 
Is this the right way to think about it?
I’m confused about this for a lot of reasons, but one is that when I look at the ol’ portfolio, I never see a breakdown of the amount of shares I own of specific companies in the index fund.
Edit 2: I’m doing my due diligence and researching, and I found this:
“Technically you own the fund, but the fund is just made up of shares of the companies or assets in that fund. Usually shares of the fund are kept to double or triple digit dollar prices. They give you transitive fractional ownership of the underlying companies. So if you have 1 share of SPY, you theoretically own some small fraction of Amazon, because the fund owns lots of Amazon stock and you own part of the fund.
With all of the different types of ETFs out there these days, you have to be careful you make sure you know what you’re buying. Well established funds like SPY and VOO are fine. But in the case of something like the defunct fund XIV, a lot of people got screwed because they didn’t really know how the fund worked.”
Can someone please ELI5. I know the answer is in here somewhere, but I need help interpreting it. HELP

Thanks HODL_monk. I appreciate the insight. This is what I wanted to know

It should work out just fine. Delayed confirmations have spooked me before too. But it was always done within a few hours. It’s A watched pot never boils type of thing, but yet it always ends up posting...

Can you explain what you mean by this? If it’s inflation pricing in assets as opposed to being a bubble, what would that mean to prices over the next 10 years?
@_date: 2019-06-15 08:20:55
I totally agree. Shit gets real though when you start overthinking where you are going to keep multiple copies of your seed words...don’t lose those little guys
@_date: 2019-08-03 09:44:26
Wait. Do you ended up buying a house? Or are you waiting? Because I feel like the market is at the height right now.
Edit: I now know the chart says it isn’t a bubble in America, when I assumed it was a bubble.so I assume now that you bought the house. 
California home prices are insane right now. They have surpassed pre 2008 numbers by 10-20%. I’m holding out for the prices to fall. That is risky in itself, but I couldn’t live with myself if I bought and prices fell. I’d be more comfortable being patient and having the prices go up still and just biting the bullet in 5 years.

This may be a silly question, but if, for example, you have a ledger nano s, having your seed words is the equivalent to having your private keys, correct?
Edit: I think I found the answer on a different thread. I did, right? :
As the other commenters have already mentioned, you can't extract the see from the wallet. If you are that concerned about the integrity of your backup, I would either get a second Ledger (that's what I did) and "restore" your wallet there to test it or create a new wallet on your phone or whatever, temporarily move your coins there, and then perform the upgrade and restore process before sending the coins back. Of course, that opens you up to any vulnerabilities associated with regular software wallets. If you want to be super paranoid about it, you could set up an Armory airgapped wallet (for Bitcoin, at least) and use that. However, it's probably easier to just buy another Ledger at that point.

Wait. You think that you have to do something illegal in order to get arrested?

I came into the bitcoin world about two years ago. When I heard this advice for the first time two years ago, I acted on it. Even though I know it already, it’s still good to hear it again and I really appreciate you pointing this out to our new friends in this sphere.
We sometimes forget how early this tech is, and educating people is more important than ever.
TLDR: Thank you!
