Kraken is one of the most powerful exchanges out there. Mt Gox os child's play compared to them.

@_date: 2014-06-05 19:56:01

@_date: 2013-03-21 16:39:13
What is fueling this growth? An explosion of merchants and services accepting Bitcoins, fear of the European Union and the banks or major speculation?
@_date: 2013-04-02 12:16:29
ok. Sounds fair enough. Even though I don't see a big difference between 100 and 200.
@_date: 2013-04-11 13:31:41
1 BTC = 1 BTC. You don't seem to get that part.
@_date: 2013-03-14 10:32:18
61 BTC here.
Bought a few at 27 EUR, biggest chunck at 35 EUR and a few at 34. 
The profit is minimal, but I'm also spending them, in some cases, they are not only savings.
@_date: 2013-03-31 19:41:51
Now that's lovely. Can you share some more tech details?
@_date: 2013-03-28 00:28:43
How many confirmations do you have? You can see that on blockchain.info
@_date: 2013-04-02 12:09:13
I agree with this. Even if this might sound like comparing apples to oranges, look at the Mobile Apps market. There are magazines in every language dedicated to them, there are TV shows in every language and the market cap is much more than 1 bn USD. There is really where "my mom heard of X" apply. Until as many people who buy apps will use Bitcoins, we're not in the media attention phase. That's were we need to aim if we even dream about replacing something as basic as gold. 
Most of the people here diappoint me for thinking that this is the top. Hopefully they will panic sell soon.
@_date: 2013-04-04 12:54:55
I've stated my support. :)

Follow me on this one. Imagine some bad ass dudes, in a small low lit room. The one with the cigar asks the other:
Got the cash?
Got the dough?
Got the cheese?
Do you have the bucks? (just getting in the groove)
Got the coins?
Show me the satoshis!
Sent the bitcoins?
Got the bits? (my fav)
Show me the beesees!
Where's the stashi?
1 satoshi G and you can have it!
10000 bits and he's dead. Final offer?

A friend of mine just signed up and I bugged him to tell me his number in the queue. Mostly so I can confirm what other people around here are saying since yesterday.
@_date: 2013-03-28 21:03:13
wow, why oh why do I not have cash in mtgox right no? This does look very shallow.
@_date: 2013-04-02 22:24:27
What if it's not a bubble? What if we, as a community, manage to drive this baby 1000x higher in value and in awareness? You consider 1 bn $ too big of a market cap? What's the alternative? Sell all the bitcoins and invest the profits in what? Gold? Perishable assets? Collection cars? Or keep the cash in a banking system which tries to rip us off at every corner? The utter best investment a person can make is in hard work and knowledge. Hard work to make an alternative to the current system grow can only expand our horizons as a civilzation. Even if it bursts in a few months of years, bankers should lose some of their smug in front of "geeks" with valueable knowledge in economics. I, for one, have learned a lot in these 2 months.
@_date: 2013-03-21 12:35:45
I see what you did there.
@_date: 2013-03-15 14:43:43
I also got one of those emails from mtgox. Should I use it? hm.
@_date: 2013-04-03 12:44:15
What do you mean by " I want to make my bitcoin investment in this bubble back." ?
@_date: 2013-03-27 23:06:03
Did you verify your account with them? Sent in the papers and all that?
70% of the cash I put in Bitcoin was trough my mtgox verfified account. They even were ok after I initial sent paperwork with an old address. 
@_date: 2013-03-28 00:52:22
A bitcoin transfer went in 2 hours for me. Quite a big sum, from blockchain.info, with 6 confirmations (or 8. I didn't catch the exact time). It's all good in mtgox land.
@_date: 2013-03-27 14:59:56
Still quite a lot to go.
@_date: 2013-04-03 09:06:11
What makes you think they didn't trade? I think they traded but the API servers are under pressure, thus huge delays.
@_date: 2013-04-03 15:07:16
I second that.
@_date: 2013-03-26 10:36:12
Sound advice!
@_date: 2013-03-27 16:14:39
The one accepting BTC is not out yet. I'm working now on how the payment system will work and then back to the game itself. Got a bit side-tracked by BTC fever :)

@_date: 2013-03-11 15:16:47
Weird. Anyway, I got faster results with bitcoin-24, even though limited to 500 EUR every 10 days (IIRC). That took 1 day.

Take a chill pill and forget about this money. That's how investments work. If you obsess over it, no good will come out.

@_date: 2013-03-21 16:33:23
But shouldn't this growth be at a more stable rate? I'm saying this not because of calculations or for some economic reason, but mostly psychological reasons. Big jumps seem untrustworthy. Or?

Looking at your posting history, this seems legit. Not.

@_date: 2013-04-01 21:30:07
Can you afford to lose 100$? 50$? 20$? Buy the corresponding amount of Bitcoins. Hold on to them for a while, see how things evolve. Stick around here, read the news, contribute to the community. If you don't like what you discover, either buy some items or services with those Bitcoins (through the various means of doing that) or sell them. If it's going up or down, heck knows. It's a fun ride.
Also, if you jump on the  bandwagon, try making an impact: contact a merchant or talk to a friend. Maybe a few years down the road you can tell your kids a fun story how you were part of a movement.
@_date: 2013-04-02 10:02:09
Very. True. I wonder how many people around here are working on such technologies? I'm one.

that is some sweet design

I would love to see BTC used for more digital good, services or subscriptions and I'm actually working on an experiment of my own. Until then, keep on doing what you just did.

@_date: 2013-03-27 09:43:44
no, you are not the only one :)
I like growth, but not steep growth. Hopefully we reach a small plateau soon. Maybe in 2-3 weeks after the Cyprus deal cools down (even though that's probably only 30% of the reason why it's growing) and after Coinbase gets its act together.
@_date: 2013-03-08 09:16:39

@_date: 2013-07-05 20:39:12

@_date: 2013-03-22 23:29:10
I'm curious about this too. If the amount is big enough, the fees shouldn't matter, right?

@_date: 2013-10-14 16:53:08
Correct. Even back then, nobody from cyprus answered my questions. 
One huge difference between now and then is that in Europe, at least, there were many more ways to buy Bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-03-19 15:32:08
Hold or use it to purchase stuff as you would normaly do. Hoarding can only get Bitcoins so far.
@_date: 2013-03-24 10:33:51

If i'd have 0.01 BTC everytime, I'd still have a small fortune. Anyway, at the rate this subreddit is growing, we're going to see more of such questions. People would rather as first than inform themselves (well, some of them, at least). We should start a betting pool for this.
@_date: 2013-04-09 22:11:56
I have thought about that but I hate my bank and I only invested what I can afford to lose. Basically, I'd rather have that money in Bitcoins than in the bank account of my greedy bank.
@_date: 2013-03-28 19:17:43
If you think that this hype is because 1 ATM, you're funny. Even if 1 ATM would be enough to send a message, it's not enough for this current rally. I belive that people who own bitcoins are smarter than that. If I'm wrong, please sell your Bitcoins now or donate them to me. I'm accepting donations at: 1572dNy9P3YPgD3m3fjDEvF86JbDpaEbyZ ;)
@_date: 2013-03-20 15:08:45
I don't think anyone is living under the impression that the gov. will/can ignore the Bitcoins for long. What happend until now was the first step. How things evolve, we shall wait and see. I don't think a similar scenario ever existed before.

I was wondering about that too. The backup on blockchain.info is a key, while the backup of a local wallet is a .dat file. I have the feeling that a backup on blockchain.info is useful only for blockchain.info. Is that correct?
@_date: 2013-03-21 16:06:30

You mentioning Facebook sparked other ideas in my mind: 
1. Facebook BTC tiping, similar to the tipbot here
2. Using BTC as currency for Facebook Apps/Games, even though this might come on top of Facebook's currency.
I wonder if this would work...

Not true. You don't have any friends who play poker online for real USD? I don't mean big bucks, but at least spare change. You don't have friends who make sport bets? It's a natural progression for anything valuable.

I would advise that if you have a big-ish about of money, don't spend it all at one go. Split it down in smaller transactions. E.g. I just saw the price go up and down from by 0.5 EUR over half an hour.

I feel you bro. The first day I bought 2 BTC, i gambled and had 4. Then I gambled again and had 0.5 :( Good thing the BTC were cheap 2 months ago. Anyway, Bitcoin, USD or bottles of beer, gambling is never ok.

Because these DDoS attacks didn't target Bicoin directly. They targeted the Internet infrastructure at a deeper level. Many servers were affected.
@_date: 2013-03-27 23:01:33
I'm not convinced.

It's most likely the trading algorithm matching supply and demand. Can't be all real persons.

I was hoping for this, but I still can't believe it. :O

any mods around?
@_date: 2013-03-21 16:25:42
Can you please describe what it does? Also, is it Windows only? I see some dll requirements.
@_date: 2013-03-22 10:06:15
I can not emphasize enough how true and important this is!

yeah huge lag. They need server upgrades, I guess.
@_date: 2013-04-12 23:15:48
yes, please! Where do I sign for this?

I see people around saying this, but I'm confused. Why will they become irrelevant? What will replace GPUs?

If you help grow the ecosystem and spread the word, it can continue as much as you want. It's up to you and to us. Sure, the goof-ups of the Euro goverments helps, but that also brings speculation, which can only take Bitcoin so far.
@_date: 2013-03-24 22:01:20
It has to do with our greed. I've seen way too many doing the "I've made free money" dance around here. Hopefully they fell in the bear trap.

I'm able to log into my account, but bitcoinity shows lag..

It's too late. Sorry, shop closed. Where were you when it was 10 $? You're right. There is no point anymore. We have reached the moon. Now... we have no more goals. /sarcasm

I'm game. Which logo?

"The government siezed the biggest exchange?" In what parallel universe did that happen?

holly molly, that sounds über-generic. And an  email. I can't help myself but feel skeptic.

I don't know, but you get my upvote for being awesome.

I'm flattered that you took me seriously. upvoted

@_date: 2013-03-21 16:44:50
Makes sense

I'm curious to see your etsy shop :) Link?
