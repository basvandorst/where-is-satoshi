That seems like a pretty good assessment. Bitcoin isn't for everyone, so if its value proposition doesn't interest you, nothing wrong with that.

So, a valuable lesson well taught, then?

That sounds like something you'd need a bot for, have it monitor the price until it passes your threshold, then place a limit order.

Diversify, and ignore the "going to be big" talk. Nobody can predict that. Bitcoin is interesting and has potential, it also has a lot of flaws. If you think it looks like something that is currently undervalued, then consider how much money you are willing to bet on your assessment that it is undervalued. Don't go all-in on anything; prices are and always will be stochastic. Don't invest more than you can afford to lose.
Also don't put too much stock in the advice of some schmuck on the internet. I Am Not A Financial Advisor, just some random guy with an interest in markets.

Are you serious? Maybe my work on bizarro economics will come in handy after all.

A big list of hypothetical results with no word as to what they are results of doesn't exactly inspire confidence.

I find watching the price swings and people reacting to it pretty entertaining, but I don't have any skin in the game yet.

It honestly hadn't occurred to me that there might be legal hurdles. I know they are very common, especially arbitrage is impossible without very fast bots, and I know that their API is public knowledge, but IANAL so I can't say anything certain.

All I have is .001, I'm still figuring out my way in. Good luck!

Is there a public mirror? All I see is a login page.
