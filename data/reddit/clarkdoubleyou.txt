Seen that crap story at least 3 times now.
@_date: 2018-01-29 20:37:59
Yeah sure. Or maybe dragons!
@_date: 2018-09-02 20:12:02
Pretty damn interesting!
@_date: 2018-08-11 19:55:04
Some ETH.
@_date: 2018-05-24 20:48:19
Ha, nice!
@_date: 2018-05-26 22:06:42
Hopefully no-one tries to break into his house to search for coins because of that..

Scaling problem solved and Community reunited without too much chaos and price tanking would be fantastic.

Bitcoinists source is non-existent.

Too bad.. so it's bread and water again tonight ;)

Exactly my thoughts. China banning Bitcoin has become a nice running gag that never failed to create chaos so far.
@_date: 2017-01-22 14:48:31
nice things about me
@_date: 2016-12-28 20:02:49
Good to know
@_date: 2018-06-07 10:14:41
@_date: 2017-04-02 20:27:42
Complete Bullshit.
@_date: 2018-03-08 21:06:05
Oh, I will. I bought the dip last time it was 189€.
@_date: 2019-01-15 09:21:40
Nice! But there's nothing worse than an obvious BTC paper wallet in case someone searches your stuff in order to steal.
@_date: 2019-01-14 13:55:30
I'm also planning a $10 Billion Bitcoin investment!
@_date: 2018-02-18 15:05:26
Love it!
@_date: 2018-02-03 19:50:53
Username... Ok

Awareness means nothing, most people still don't have the slightest understanding.
@_date: 2018-03-16 20:45:55


@_date: 2018-07-05 21:07:23
That's because it's easy to remember!
@_date: 2018-04-12 18:52:49
Have you ever heard of supply and demand?
@_date: 2018-04-08 19:47:42


@_date: 2018-04-12 20:44:23
You know what's most relevant for price? Supply and demand, the dynamic duo of crypto.
@_date: 2018-04-12 20:57:23
See how easy I crushed one of those little saplings? They will never become real trees...
@_date: 2018-04-12 19:41:47
Big buy order, short squeeze. Nothing special about that, and time plays no role either since trading is worldwide.
@_date: 2018-04-12 20:58:30
It explains price movements. It's not meant to explain anything beyond that.
@_date: 2017-05-06 21:09:17
Watching that live on the chart was actually better than any movie.
@_date: 2017-05-24 22:30:48
Watching your sell live back in the days was as entertaining as a good movie, welcome back!
@_date: 2017-07-09 12:32:21
Yeah, but we will live on through our Reddit posts :D
@_date: 2017-06-19 13:20:03
Not sure if fascist dystopia or just US reality.
@_date: 2018-12-16 11:12:06
Not sure if bitcoin-related, but [great band name and retro feel](

Typical bot reply.
