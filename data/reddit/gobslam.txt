He wouldn't be a millionaire untill he moved some of his coins. Some may argue that he sold a few of his bitcoin addresses privately, but that makes very little sense, as the person who bought these would be chased til the end of the world if they ever spent them. Satoshi's BTC have most likely never been touched at all, and thus he is probably not a millionaire.

The conspiracy theorist inside me really wants Dorian to be Satoshi. I just have this urge deep inside for him to be the grand master schemer of all time, who puts on an amazing act and plays the media for a purpose unknown at this time.

I genuinely believe there is a good chance of Satoshi being remembered as an important figure in human history. Cryptocurrencies are most likely the future of finance, and so it is only fitting that one of the most influencial early entrepreneurs within the field is remembered as "one of the greats" or whatever.

I have this burning desire to believe that this is actually Satoshi, and that is he just playing us entirely to get out of this, as he cherishes his privacy deeply. Or better yet, what if there is some wicked conspiracy theory behind all of this? Something something government, secrecy and what not. I just really want this to unfold throughout the future and develop into an amazing story of some sort. 
@_date: 2014-03-06 17:28:06
The more posts I read on this subject/article incident, the more confident I am in the theory that there were multiple people involved in the creation of Bitcoin. Does it not seem logical that perhaps someone Satoshi met throughout the years would share his point of view and to some extent, if not just as much/even more than himself, created bitcoin alongside Satoshi? This would somewhat explain, or bring some sense of logic into the whole "writes quality english" thing as well as answer lots of other questions.

Scenario: In 2053, the world as we know it ends with the culmination of a 10 year-long cold war between the US and Russia, known as The Cold War 2 up til the very end. Nuclear warheads are unleashed on the world as the conflict snowballs out of control. In a last attempt to save humanity, Do(lo)rian Nakamoto uses his newly invented time machine to go back to 2005. For three years he works tirelesly to find a way to change the outcome of the war, and finally settles for an economic approach. Nakamoto realizes that the financial system throughout the 2020's and 30's played a major part in the underlying reasons for the war, and so he begins experimenting. From his experience throughout the future, Dorian remembers how this phenomenon called "cryptocurrency" was close to taking over the financial system back in the late 20's, but somehow the centralized system crashed, and was left useless. The financial system was once again too big to fail.
Satoshi sees the flaws in the system as he sits by his bedside desk in Southern California, working tirelessly to engineer his financial save-the-world-idea. Years pass, and in 2008 he is finally ready to unleash his creation *Bicoin*, which may be the very destruction of the financial system as we know it. Will Bitcoin succeed? Will Satoshi save the world? Only time will tell..
@_date: 2013-12-03 07:01:04
Potentially speaking, we don't know yet whether bitcoin will make it or not. Thus, we don't know the margin of which determines the fate of bitcoin in its entirety. If the margin is minimal, you could very likely be a key component to the fate of the entire economic world. Everyone's fortune and prosperity hangs in the balance. And you, you alone, will have to make sure you present bitcoin in the best possible way, to increase our chances, and maybe, save the world. - Absolutely no pressure.

@_date: 2013-12-01 02:36:09
I don't think you entirely understand how this works. The major holders of bitcoin know better than to crash the market. They see the potential and most of the major bitcoin holders are doing everything in their power to support the bitcoin community and the infrastructure that is being built around bitcoin. Look at Max Kaiser, the Winklevoss twins, Gavin Andersen, etc.. -
I suspect the current hold-up in price fluctuation is caused by numerous mid-sized holders dumping their holdings over time however, as to not crash the price but to take out a portion of their holdings.
@_date: 2013-12-19 17:36:53

@_date: 2013-12-02 02:19:59
I think alt coins serve a purpose in the grand scheme of things. They provide an essential competition to bitcoin, in order to push the development of the actual bitcoin protocol, and to encourage healthy competition in a free market. It proves that bitcoin, whilst gaining massive traction, is still not a monopoly for crypto currencies. I do however believe that bitcoin has a massive advantage in that the infrastructure is expanding rapidly, and there is massive financial backing for this. No other litecoin is even remotely close to this point, and are pretty much entirely based on economic speculation. 
People believe they will grow in value over the next x amount of hours/days/weeks, and invest accordingly. You could use the same argument for bitcoin as well, but bitcoin has grown out (imo) of the speculative bubble, and into a real world where infrastructure and real money is used to develop it further. 
I think there is potential in altcoins as well, i just don't know which ones. I think the vast majority only serve a purpose as a psychological reminder of crypto's being a free market which requires innovation to stay on top. Bitcoin is open-source obviously, so any ground-breaking discoveries we see in alt-coins could potentially be "absorbed" into the bitcoin protocol, given that they don't contradict any essentials to the bitcoin design.
@_date: 2013-12-08 10:40:20
There are ~450,000 addresses with more than 0.1 BTC - Personally, these are the only addresses that make up the actual current market. Anyone with less than 0.1 BTC are not really a part of the market. Now, keep in mind that people often own more than one address, especially when you're getting up in to these high numbers. 
The 0.06% you're talking about do own 68% of the market, but 0.06% is a completely wrong realistic number. If you follow my logic on this one, there would be 13,000 addresses among these "0.06%" - 13,000/450,000 = 2.8%
2.8% of bitcoin owners own 68% of the market. - You will never be able to create a market where distribution is better than this, considering circumstances. Certain people will always be in a position to hoard value, that is how humans work.

I'm a long-term holder, my friend. I never touch my BTC after my original purchase, and simply referring to me as a "Permabull" is extremely incompetent. I might be bullish, but for a good reason. 
If you have read up **thoroughly** on bitcoin, and have a reasonably good understanding of how the world works, you realize its potential. However, if you are too invested in the thought that nothing breaks the "standards of traditional economic trading" then you'll end up like Peter Schiff. 
Everyone is entitled to their opinion. My opinion is that bitcoin has massive potential, but it still needs to advance through dangerous waters. Anyone claiming they **know** bitcoin will fail, are without question the deluded ones.

@_date: 2013-12-02 01:39:33
Alright, you make several solid points, i do agree with some of them, most certainly. I'll try to explain some of the vital information as organized as i can.
* Most bitcoins are indeed owned by a very small fraction of the market. Several of these people are economists and big names in the financial world. The Winklevoss twins and Max Kaiser are among these. - These people are without a doubt a major threat to bitcoin in general, but only through a scenario in which multiple of these big whales decide it is a good time to cash out. At which point we will get one of these famous "crashes" that we've had in the past. Personally i would see this as an opportunity to invest further, and i know there are a massive amount of people out there who have the same mindset. These players have no way to completely destroy bitcoin, they can only influence the market cap for a brief amount of time, after which a lot of people will use the opportunity to buy in / buy more bitcoins. 
 Now, there are several major holders out there who could potentially cause crashes in the future. However, as the market cap grows, the chance for either of these whales to cash out becomes less likely, as bitcoin works like a snowball-effect. Once we reach a certain point, bitcoin will gain exponential momentum.
* I'm not gona claim to be an expert on the mining of bitcoins, however i've picked up some information concerning the state of mining. The miners apparently have absolutely nothing to gain from "taking control" of bitcoin directly. If they were to start implementing changes to the protocol without approval from the foundation or general market population, they would kill bitcoin. Obviously, they have nothing to gain from killing bitcoin. - This is my current understanding of the situation, however the one i am the least confident in. Please feel free to correct me if i am wrong in my assumptions!
* The current market cap does indeed allow small-scale manipulation of the daily price fluctuation. This means that day-traders could potentially reap good profit off of manipulating the market. This affects bitcoin relatively little in general though, as the market cap will most likely continue to grow as the weeks go by. 
* Through developments in infrastructure, such as Bitpay and other services, bitcoin can be used as legitimate currency. Businesses can accept payments in bitcoin and instantly have their transaction converted to their local currency through automated services. 
* People hoarding bitcoin is not an issue in the long-term. As i said, the developments in infrastructure makes it easier and less complicated to spend your bitcoins without losing your bitcoin-stockpile. You simply sell/purchase bitcoins automatically every time you receive/spend them. - This is a short-term solution, as bitcoin could potentially become a global, stable currency, at which point using and saving bitcoin the same way you use and save $, £ or € is just the same, only with the addition of several benefits that bitcoin provides.
* Confirmation times is only relevant when making major transactions. A common misinterpretation of the bitcoin technology is that you have to wait 10 minutes for transactions to be complete, otherwise you could be scammed. - As you hit "pay/send" on your mobile application or by swiping a card, you complete the transaction of bitcoins. You get the first confirmation that the payment is complete by the transaction-device (mobile phone, computer, card machine) verifying the balance of the public addresses- The second verification is received a maximum of 10 minutes later, in the next block in the blockchain. However, this is only used as a "double check" of the transactions validity. Thus, minor transactions don't need these verifications unless you have massive security concerns. Now obviously, this technology is also being worked on from a developer standpoint, and they will most definitely make changes in the protocol in the coming months/years, related to transaction verification. 
* Hacking/DDOS attacks on exchange sites are only going to occur in the start-up phase of bitcoin. As bitcoin progresses further, exchanges will come to the point where they need top-end security and multiple servers and IT-technology, to prevent these types of attacks. - Again, only a matter of time and resources put to development.
I completely agree with some of your concerns however, and this is indeed why bitcoin is currently volatile and unstable. There is not enough security and resources spent on development in order for bitcoin to function to its full potential. However, as time goes by and developments are made with the infrastructure supporting bitcoin, as well as to the protocol itself, i have no doubt that bitcoin will become a viable currency, and a massive global force that pushes the frontier of economics to a whole new level. You have to understand that "Rome was not built in one day" - there are flaws, sure, but most, if not all of them, can be corrected or minimized. There is very few things as of right now that could destroy bitcoin entirely, or completely prevent its growth. Because the investors, developers, and the market itself, knows the potential. As everyone sees the green field on the other side of the bridge, everyone will continue to work for perfection, in order to reach that point.
A very good argument for the potential success of bitcoin goes as follows: Imagine a world where bitcoin completely takes over the world in the most "to the moon"-way possible. Everyone uses bitcoin as their local and global currency for both savings, transactions, salaries and everything in between. The infrastructure supporting bitcoin has been developed, and all the previously-listed flaws have been corrected and improved upon to a major extent. New innovations have come along, and payments are safe, easy and undoubtedly effective. In this world, what are the positive aspects, and what are the negative aspects? There is more economic freedom, there is more room for innovations within economic growth both privately and for corporations and businesses. There is less manipulation and regulation from the state, and everything in the world of money has become more effective, safer and easier. I can't even think of any negative effects off the top of my head, but i'm sure there are a few. But do the positive aspects outweigh the negatives? - Undoubtedly. 
This is why i believe in bitcoins potential, and i have barely skimmed the surface of innovative-speculation. I know the basics of most aspects of bitcoin by now, but i still have a lot to learn. This is my opinion, and i genuinely believe we are witnessing the birth of an economic revolution.
Edit: Another point that i completely forgot to mention as i wrote this is basically a major force to determine bitcoin's potential growth and success. The opportunity for countless people in the world, to store their economic value in an environment that is not inflationary, and is not controlled by a regime or corrupt government. Cyprus was a good indication of what is to come in this aspect of the bitcoin growth. Sure bitcoin is volatile, but as it grows bigger and more developed, the volatility will gradually perish. Bitcoin is essentially a tool for a huge amount of people to not only get rich or gain substantial profits, but a medium of which the suppressed, poor and unstable nation's population can store their value.
Another discussion i had with my uncle most recently was quite interesting. We discussed the potential of bitcoin when we started speculating in what would happen if bitcoin suddenly caught the attention of nations, not just private people or corporations? - What happens when the first few countries in the world decide to jump on board? What happens if suddenly there is a race against time between the worlds nations as to who can fetch the highest % of bitcoins in circulation, for the least amount of value? This is when the exponential growth potential of the famous "S-Curve" comes in to play. - This is obviously very far-fetched speculation, but non the less i see the potential of this actually happening, given a world where bitcoin is on the verge of mass-adoption.
@_date: 2013-12-01 04:38:30
Not really. But it is interesting to see these major transactions occur. If you go through the charts you'll notice they happen every now and then, but this magnitude is quite rare.
@_date: 2013-12-01 03:14:51
Read up on the subject before you start blabbering about, please. If you genuinely believe bitcoin is useless for anything but a speculative business strategy, you are absolutely clueless. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 17:15:33
I'm sorry, i just didn't see the point in wasting my energy on someone like you. Because there are countless of your type, jumping onto these forums with little to no knowledge of the complexity of bitcoin. It's not only about knowing what it does either, it is about knowing what it could potentially do, and seeing the big picture. 
Bitcoin is steadily increasing on a yearly basis. The fluctuation in the market is only natural. I agree that at the moment most people view bitcoin as a speculation strategy, and easy money. However, the promise of bitcoin, the infrastructure that is being developed to support it, the development process of the protocol itself, is what is interesting about bitcoin. 
Bitcoin is on its way to mass-adoption, and the reason why is because of all the VC's putting massive amounts into the development as i just mentioned. The force behind this revolution is ever-increasing, and as more and more products and ground-breaking functions are released within the immediate future, we will see price-surges accordingly. 
The point is that **when** bitcoin reaches a certain market-cap, and when adoption is made easy and less complex, more people will have the opportunity to jump on board. More people will rely on its success as they invest into not only the bitcoin, but the development of the surrounding economy that is currently booming in growth. 
It requires a lot of studying and research to fully understand its potential, i only briefly skimmed the surface in this little reply. Do some of that research and if you are open-minded and objective, you'll understand the potential as many of us already have.
@_date: 2013-12-06 08:02:22
The man was literally farting out numbers and theories... what on earth was this guy high on when he did his research and analysis?  
@_date: 2013-12-07 07:11:15
I cannot emphasize this enough. People need to realize that instability and volatility comes naturally when implementing a completely new technology into the most powerful market of them all. There will be ups and there will be downs, which limits bitcoin's use as a currency in the traditional sense. However, it is not until bitcoin stabilizes at its maximum potential market cap that we will see the volatility expire. When major investors can no longer manipulate the price by several percent.
Another thing that i personally have come to realize as i have studied bitcoin's technology, and reflected on its potential through different aspects, is that innovation and creative solutions are far beyond our current imagination's capacity. If we were "smart enough" as of right now, to think of every use and every potential improvement for bitcoin in an instant, we would have done just that, and the development of this new technology would be exponentially much faster.
However, innovation and creative development takes time. It takes a few geniuses to explore, develop and test these new innovations, before they can be implemented and utilized. 
If you believe in bitcoin and it's potential, you better have the balls to stand the test of time alongside it. Either it fails, or it explodes with a force so massive that even ToTheMoonGuy will shit his pants. Only time will tell.
@_date: 2013-11-26 21:07:23

This is truly interesting. I don't want to speculate on the topic of whether or not bitcoin will conquer the world and become a new major global currency and storage of wealth, however, i do believe we are in for an enormous growth. Whether or not we will reach sufficient heights for bitcoin to stabilize, and whether or not we will see an innovative growth with infrastructure and architecture remains to be seen. I am very optimistic at this point.

Don't get offended by the way the community on WoW-forums behave, especially in regards to a technology they have barely heard of and know very little about. 
It would take very little effort to turn the majority of these types of "trolls" into bitcoin-believers, but it can't be done by a complete stranger over the internet. It requires someone on a personal level to explain the technology and potential in a different setting.
This comes to prove that bitcoin is currently widely regarded as something that is inefficient and too unstable / volatile for most people. The technology and infrastructure needs to be heavily developed, and i certainly hope there are lots of people around the globe making decent and fast progress in that area.

@_date: 2013-11-28 21:33:34
There will come a time when bitcoin stabilizes. Why? Because the infrastructure and architecture that is being built to support it, both hardware and software- are going to enhance its general ability to be a storage of value, medium of exchange and lessen its speculative volatility once we reach astounding heights. The make or break moments are now, in the late infancy (yes we are still in it's infancy imo) - When/if we get to these astounding heights, we are going to see stabilization. Wall-Street wouldn't be speaking about bitcoins **long term** potential if it weren't for it's potential to work as a medium of exchange with stability, and a relatively safe storage of value.
@_date: 2013-11-28 04:02:34
First of all, no, you did not have bitcoins in 2008, as they were not released untill 2009. There were only a handful of people throughout 2009 who ever got their hands on bitcoins, and it was done through mining. - Secondly, in all seriousness, i think the chances of bitcoin crashing are very, very small at this point. HOWEVER, a political interference or media-outburst pointing out a crucial flaw could destroy the entire value completely within a short amount of time. It does look like bitcoin is going nowhere but up however, so i'd personally recommend investing if you have some cash to spare.
@_date: 2013-12-01 03:15:25

The only issue as of right now is the lack of **constructive** criticism, that isn't just mindless guessing and media related articles with the intent to fetch as many views as possible.
Bitcoin is extremely volatile, most of us know that. There is however great potential, and the majority would seem to agree that an investment is worth the risk as long as you can afford to lose the money over night.

This isn't a bubble popping, this is a completely normal market fluctuation based on new information, as with any other traditional market. The price could go down considerably more, but as long as the price goes back up, there is no "bubble popping" - That would imply the price never returning to previous heights and beyond.

If there was a China-bubble about to pop, i believe it would have already. I'm not so sure there will be any more consequences in China at this point. And as the Chinese government sees the potential growth all over the world, they will have to reevaluate their decision eventually. That is my bullish opinion though, but in light of all the recent news and numbers, i dare say being bullish is rather logical for the long term.

Satoshi touched on this in his original paper. The block chain information will never outweigh the capacity of completely normal computer storage. And it will never get to the point where downloading the block chain will be ridiculously inconvenient.

The way you formulate sentences and the way you behave is a testament of your ignorance. You're not worth my time, quite frankly. I gain nothing from trying to convince you, neither do you, in your ignorant little bubble. End of discussion.

I think you've just given your son a life without economic worry. Make sure to educate him well given a possible scenario where he could live solely off of the money! Don't make the same mistake a lot of rich parents have made in the past if bitcoin truly takes off! :)

A massive portion of those addresses are Satoshi's. He presumably has ~1,000,000 BTC, and those BTC were never moved from their original wallets. I'm sure Satoshi has kept their keys and stored it somewhere, he wouldn't be throwing away his own making, so to speak.

So, because bitcoin has some serious issues, that **can** be solved, it won't succeed? You underestimate the power behind a movement with such massive potential. I never downvote anything bitcoin related unless it is strictly illogical or silly. Your comments are neither, thus i haven't downvoted you. However, i genuinely believe you are wrong in assuming that bitcoin will fail because it has major obstacles to go through. I have simply stopped discussing technical details of bitcoin on forums like these because it would take me several word-pages to make a simple argument. If you have read up on bitcoin to the extent that many of us have, you **should**, by using simple logic, realize the potential, and realize the obstacles are solvable. I'm not sure you are aware of the actual work that is being put in to develop the infrastructure of bitcoin either? There are currently more than one-hundred start-ups related to bitcoin, some with greater potential than others. There are tens of millions of dollars invested in building the actual infrastructure, and millions invested in development of the protocol. 
You are entitled to your opinion, as am i. My opinion is that you simply don't see the big picture, and thus rely on the information you have and conclude that bitcoin is destined to fail. Again, time will tell.

Satoshi Nakamoto should for sure get some form of recognition in the future. However, as most of us seem to agree that this is (hopefully) merely the beginning for bitcoin, i highly doubt 2013 should be Satoshi's year. 2014 or 2015 perhaps? Time will tell.

This might actually be an incredibly accurate description of what restaurants 10 years from now might just do.

If bitcoin catches on like wildfire, they will be two of, if not **the** two richest people in the world. A market cap of ~$1 trillion gives them $10 billion worth of bitcoins. A market cap of ~$10 trillion gives them $100 billion worth, which at the moment would make them them top 3 in the world.
Satoshi obviously only requires a ~$730 billion market cap to be the worlds richest person. I bet you he's sitting at home in front of his secret encrypted computer yelling "to the moon!" just as must as we are.

What evidence do you base this off of? What evidence is there that these investors are now backing out? I'm not saying they are not, i'm just interested in seeing relevant evidence.

Some people are depressingly attached to bitcoin. This is how a real market works. Bad news trigger crashes when the price reaches high points on low volume. It'll be interesting to see how far down we land, but i'm ready with my buy-button for whenever i feel we hit rock-bottom. Free coins, isn't this great?
@_date: 2013-12-05 18:12:15
Great post, however, i think you are underestimating the speed of bitcoin's adoption. The infrastructure and protocol itself needs a lot of improvement before these things you talk about could ever be realized, however, they are being worked on, and as bitcoin grows bigger, faster, so will the development. I highly doubt we are looking at ~5 years+ for these things to happen. A few years, sure.
@_date: 2013-11-27 16:36:40
I honestly believe that you are underestimating the general business-related competence of most of us bitcoin enthusiasts. There is a lot to learn about bitcoin, and those of us who have read up and collected a good understanding of the system and current infrastructure, realize what potential it has. 
Because of this potential, media, investors and eventually the "masses" will catch more and more on to the news. As we break barriers both in regards to value and infrastructure, there will be more media and more limelight.
As we progress further, there will be developments in regards to the system itself, and the infrastructure will help ease the introduction for every-day people like your parents or your grandparents. It will become less complex and time-consuming to get a good understanding of how the system works, eventually.
Good luck to you all, and let us hope this train reaches its destination.

Because someone posts a grammatically horrible article that is a bit too optimistic, it's time to sell? I'm not sure i'd let you manage my funds to be honest.

I think it looks cooler now, at ~$3,200
