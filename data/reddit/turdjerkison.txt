You guys are upvoting Assange? What a joke.
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:40:33
The post is literally about Assange, a known Russian puppet. I wasn't looking for this conversation to happen, but OP brought it here.

So you're going to continue to prove to the public that you're really dumb. Enjoy.
@_date: 2017-12-16 03:56:50
Do you feel strong and empowered now?
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:51:25


That's your opinion and you have ignored the point I made. Which is that you gave a zero effort comment and expect the opposite from others. It's humorous.
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:50:38
Or the post.

Too bad they don't get to be the judge of that. :) Especially if you care about the truth.
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:42:26
So is "none of that is evidence", bro.
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:15:36
You are really dumb.
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:41:19
You seem to forget that they received the hacked RNC data as well. :)

Because he has been exposed as a Russian puppet.
You can look at his AMA [here](
[He met up with the infamous Putin supporter GOP Rep. Rohrabacher as well.]( He's not concerned with exposing the truth except to the extent that it damages the United States.
He even said he received hacked RNC info but failed to post that publicly.

Those tons of people may not fully understand bitcoin, but once they see the benefits of its use, they could decide to hold for the long term. This would not result in a crash. Bitcoin has important uses. It's not a penny stock.

You framed it poorly. Among many other examples, he is only concerned with a pro-Russian agenda. Hence exposing only what harms the United States.
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:43:21
So you want more "Muh Russia" conversation?
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:24:33
Be that as it may, hopefully in the future you'll be intelligent enough to represent those policies genuinely instead of purposefully presenting them in a hostile way. That's how real discussions happen.

? Trump doesn't need to. He has aids. Lots and lots of ~~Russian mafia~~ aids.
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:55:39
He refused to leak RNC data and he was caught working in private with Donald Trump Jr. C'mon man...
