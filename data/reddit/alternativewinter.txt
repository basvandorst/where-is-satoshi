Full disclosure:  I'm a big blocker, but I thought that you guys might enjoy this model I made to show how LN and payment channels work.
Feel free to copy my idea.

I had more cups, but was limited because only a handful of people showed up.


Just curious, how is that possible without closing your channels?

This is no place for altcoin discussion.  Post it somewhere else please.

A bunch of bcash sock puppets must have upvoted this.  
I know that there is a point here, but bitcoin is primarily a store of value first, and a payment system second.
Most of the time, credit cards just work fine for payments.

What's going on with the downvotes?  It looks like the bcashers/ Roger's sock puppets are brigading this post that exposes their fraud.  Please share this post on social media so more people don't get taken.

The bitcoin.com wallet really needs to be reported, and taken off the play store.  They screenshots I linked are proof that the bitcoin.com wallet is fraudulant.
A few weeks ago, I searched for bitcoin wallet on the play store and it was one of the first ones that came up.  Little did I know what I was getting into.
First I went to send my bitcoin off my exchange into the wallet, and it had two wallets.  It was a bit confusing at first to find where I send actual  bitcoin to.  I found out later that "Bitcoin Core" is a term that the bcash trolls use to discredit bitcoin.  How childish and unprofessional that is for a company to do that.
But It gets worse:
Recently, I installed the blockchain.info wallet, and tried to transfer the funds there.  It was then I realized the trap I had gotten Into:  When you deposit bitcoin into the bitcoin.com wallet, bitcoin.com will charge you a premium to move it out.  The screenshot is proof that they are stealing other people's bitcoin.  And what do they do with that ill-goten money?  They promote their scam coin bcash as the "real bitcoin".
