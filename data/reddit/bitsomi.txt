Halving is priced in already. 20k was a bubble, 14k was a bubble. Log scale suggests a healthy price movement to 6k and slow growth from there ( with the occasionally bubble)
@_date: 2019-11-22 06:40:09
As i said, with the occasional bubble. Nothing to see here

IRS..just..stop.  
We already filled out your Tax form, no worry’s
@_date: 2019-11-08 15:02:09
Already priced in.
@_date: 2019-11-03 14:06:53
The plebs are alteady in it since 20k, like you. Haha

1.) Sure they can buy all the bitcoins, but that would mean a large wealth distribution and they still dont own the network, they just have bitcoin.
2.) This would mean they have to pay a very, very, very large chunk to manufacturers to get miners to actually attack bitcoin. Thats not going to happen as well. 
They can regulate it to ground, which will harm adoption of course, but they cant destroy it. They would have to ban the internet-people would just use vpns more. They waited way too long to be actually successful now

if you would have bought at 147$, you would have been long enough in this ecosystem to not ask such a question. OG's do not do this.

Stay for the tech.

To answer your questions one at a time:

Possibly   
There you go fella
@_date: 2019-11-10 14:39:38


Yep, your luck will run out at some point, you will lose it all and your mum will spank you.&lt;


Sorry, but no.

Long story short:  
You have a gambling problem and tried to win the money back with more gambling.  
You got lucky, the 500$ bucks could have been gone as well. Cash out and probably seek help, at one point you will lose it again (as you most likely won't stop to gamble). Especially as you can't afford to lose that money (at least how i read it)
@_date: 2019-11-22 04:12:36
There are no bulls left, they got rekt the way down.
@_date: 2019-11-15 21:13:55
Miners mine for profit, if its not profitable (over an extended time), they just stop. Miners just put sell pressure on the market, nothing more.
@_date: 2019-11-24 22:07:36
Priced in

They capitulated from October 18 all the way to january. At least the inefficient ones. Diff is starting to drop again.

Sure, when we get to 10 Mill, the next target is 1 Billion in under 10 days obviously.
@_date: 2019-11-07 14:49:48


What are you going to do then with your worthless 100 Mill USD?
@_date: 2019-10-06 23:29:12
Look at coingecko for real volume - coinmarketcap just reports what those washtrading exchanges are reporting
@_date: 2019-10-26 13:12:40
People still believe a 100x from 10000 to 1 mill is as easy as from 100$ to 10000? Cute.
@_date: 2019-10-29 17:24:09
If the price stays the same and hashrate keeps on climbing till the halvening, i be sure not many miners can take a 50% profit cut with ease and will shut off ( not instantly of course)
@_date: 2019-10-13 22:00:31
Not so long ago you could have sold everything and bought at 4k. Why didn't you buy it then? + honest advice, don't gamble your lunch money, your house and your kids away. And for god’s sake, pay your debt.
@_date: 2019-10-05 22:37:21
Yes  
No

It literally says: "After a successful investigation, stolen funds will be returned to your wallet". Identifying a hacker and getting your funds back are 2 different stories.
@_date: 2019-10-06 23:36:11
Well, that would be 3dcoin then.
@_date: 2019-10-26 13:01:17
Yeah, no. Shorts got rekt, cascade triggered.

Imagine Believing anything a random dude on the internet posts. What a clownworld
@_date: 2019-10-30 21:28:26
Well thats actually the precise answer to the question you have asked
@_date: 2019-10-06 23:31:19
And what are you going to do with that 1 Million if you can´t even buy an apple with it when everything collapses?
@_date: 2019-12-22 15:15:16
Ähm, sounds actually similiar to the current system. Miners pay for the machines to get a higher stake in the game. The wealthier you are, the more machines you can buy to get an even higher stake. You can even collaborate with other wealthy individuals and pool your wealth together.
@_date: 2019-10-31 12:28:27
That just proves that anyone can fork of bitcoin and/or ethereum, promises stuff which will never come true and/or run with investors money. As long as people fall for it (buying useless garbage), there is a market for those things.
@_date: 2019-12-12 19:54:31
Don´t throw salt at people which bought at 20k and again at 14k ,)
@_date: 2019-12-31 13:11:43
You did not read their TOS, did you? Just do the KYC and you´ll be fine.
@_date: 2019-12-04 16:53:02
Wall street is already in since a long time. You think they don´t trade in such a highly volatile market?
@_date: 2019-12-04 11:52:47
Priced in already
@_date: 2019-12-13 12:37:43
That actually doesn't look convenient at all
@_date: 2019-12-13 09:00:56
Spotted the bagholder ��. You dont buy assets which went parabolic, it will always come down again, then you buy. Now for example
@_date: 2019-12-14 11:35:53
Actually not sure if serious or trolling
@_date: 2019-12-02 09:01:28
In an financial crisis, people tend to not to invest into highly volatile investment assets. You dont want a financial crisis. No one does
@_date: 2019-12-04 11:57:43
You can propose your own implementation right now. Miners ultimately decided which version they want to support if the versions are not compatible with each other.
@_date: 2019-12-04 08:21:55
Maybe this is the thing's price range for many years ,)
@_date: 2019-12-15 09:03:45
Contact lawyer and sue them, if its a significant amount of money. People tend to let such things slide, but then they will do it agian and again.
@_date: 2019-12-14 11:39:43
USD will most likely collapse in under 10 years. So,... 1 BTC = 1 BTC
@_date: 2019-12-14 11:42:37
Ähm, no, thats not how it works.
@_date: 2019-12-19 13:00:44
Why do people think an economic crisis will benefit bitcoin? When the economic bubble pops and people lose money in the housing market or in stocks, they wont have money on hand to pure it into btc. I actually think they will cash out to have cash in hand.
@_date: 2019-12-04 11:50:41
Thank you for the heads up. Almost did the same but this post opened my eye to the possibility of losing it. Your sacrifice wont be forgotten ����
