Imagine seeing a cup of coffee priced as 0.0002 that's pretty confusing to the layman.
As for the rest of your argument, what if the value of bitcoin continues to increase? That's the whole point of making this change once, now.

Which word would you propose instead?

That's right, he's *not* a bitcoin investment consultant.
Based on about 20 seconds looking at his website, he's some sort of management consultant. He also happens to accept bitcoin payment for his services, as do many other businesses.
You could have checked this for yourself if your comment was serious. Thanks for playing!

Actually, it's quite different.
The litre is the SI unit for volume, is internationally accepted and has been around for hundreds of years. It's precisely defined, ultimately, based on an unchanging physical constant - the speed of light.
Bitcoin has existed for about 5 years and the community is still working out details like this. There's no broadly accepted nomenclature. That's why this conversation keeps coming up.
Ultimately no solution ever pleases everyone. You don't have to like it, but drawing false equivalencies with litres doesn't advance your point the way you seem to think it does.

That really sucks :(. I'm sorry to hear that rnvk.
If you're not already using Mandrill, give it a try. That's who I use for my business and they've been really good. You could easily test it for free.
The other problem is normal users who don't have a clear understanding of the difference between the 'spam' and the 'delete' buttons. In my opinion, that's a serious problem for all legitimate businesses.
As has been suggested elsewhere, bitcoin based 'stamps' for emails hold great promise for solving some of the spam related problems in the future.

We can just continue with what's already familiar to people when discussing any other money. For example (for English speakers):
5.00 bits = five bits
500.00 bits = five hundred bits
5,000.00 bits =  five thousand bits / 5k / 5g / five large
5,000,000 = five million bits / 5m
and so on...
The exact language people will use depends on their culture. For example, in China it's common to talk about money in units of 10,000 (called 'wan'). So 50k = 5 wan and 1m = 100 wan in that culture (sorry can't write Chinese for you on this phone).
What's great about a simple change to bits and sats in the way software displays bitcoin amounts is that it will allow existing culture to populate the undefined spaces. I think that will make bitcoin less intimidating and easier to accept for many people. We have to remember that bitcoin is international. Sometimes doing less and leaving room for interpretation may well be best.

The word bit existed (with various meanings) well before we ever had computers or used it in the sense you have above (e.g. 8 bits).
Using it for computers will never work. It's too confusing.
What if I have a bit of a computer? Or a bit of time? I bit into a bit of bread. It was bitter. I couldn't give two bits, really, but it's a bit confusing.
And I'll bet most of the people reading this comment understood the whole thing without any problems... :)

Sure they can choose who they do business with, but they also have a duty of care to their customers.
The reasonable and proper thing to do would have been to politely inform about their decision, in good time for him/her to make alternative arrangements for paying bills on time.
Not doing so promptly and rejecting payments without providing any notice to the customer is simply unprofessional. It sounds like something MtGox would have done.

It seems to me that you're boxing at shadows.

I think what these repeated discussions demonstrate is that not everyone thinks mBTC = mbit
Personally I'm fine using metric prefixes, decimal points or scientific notation. It doesn't really bother me, but I can see that it would make things difficult for some people, so I'm fine with moving the decimal point and think that part is a good idea.
The conversation about the term 'bits' is a totally different thing. I don't feel strongly about what we call it either way in this case. If the community wants to use bits I'm happy to go along with it. If someone comes up with something better, I'll support it.
'Bits' seems to have gained a lot of traction, so if you want to stop it you'll have to come up with a better name that catches the imagination of more people. Drawing false comparisons to litres doesn't achieve what (I assume) you want it to. That's what I'm trying to tell you.
You can argue with me based on a disagreement of the premise: mBTC = mbit but that won't achieve anything. Logically we agree with one another, you just evaluate that premise as more certain.

Xbit is not too bad if you can redefine XBT at the same time to avoid the sort of confusion that some people here are concerned about (which I assume is part of the intention?).
How would we pronounce xbit? 'Zibit?'
We might find that people would shorten it to bit anyway.

SPF is really fiddly to get right. It took us quite a few tries to get the syntax right, even after reading up on it extensively. I asked a friend of mine who's an Exchange Server consultant at one stage and he basically said it's crap and everyone hates it, but you still need to sort those records out.

Thanks for the info.

Yeah, Ashton Kutcher might be just the guy. Good thinking.

That seems to me to be something of a non sequitur :). However, if it makes you happy, I agree that your new nomenclature for measuring volume is retarded.
@_date: 2014-05-05 01:48:29
Cool idea. How do we make it happen?
