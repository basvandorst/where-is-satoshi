For the long term, it might be like that, but during two weeks before the difficult adjusts, the backlog would be skyrocketing and it would collapse the price.

If you want to manage the risk in the same time to own more bitcoins, the best strategy is buying the dip not following the trend. The panic selling moment is great entry point. Good Luck.

Banning bitcoin is very passive and losers play as China did. They have ambitions to become the world biggest crypto trading market and having the pricing power, it's more powerful than just banning, then they can use this financial nuke to subvert the other country.

You can transfer large amount of value to any member in the network without restrictions and the network is growing globally in incredible speed. That's amazing social revolution and a new global economy system is emerging, all economic activities between network members are supported by Bitcoin. Ideally we can form an company, hire people, do businesses, earn money , make a living without bank and government. Bitcoin redefines the financial orders that attracts more and more people. I am very conservative to say bitcoin is going to be 10 times big as Facebook since all of that vision will be achieved in the near future.

I don't think it's a good analogue to SA diamonds which serves as a pure commodity while bitcoin does not.

It'a not like stock market, totally different. 
The value of bitcoin is perfect to store wealth due to the scarcity and highly liquid nature. There is no cost of holding and little fee to liquidate. I firmly believe that it will replace the function of GOLD in future at least it's going to exceed the cap of gold in an unexpected speed.

Why do you cite it from rigged source ?
@_date: 2017-11-26 13:29:20
It's called confirmation bias. Initially you're not sure about if buying is good choice so you do the rehearsal in your mind and the price is continually confirming you should buy each time you ask such question until you have no doubt about it. That's why buying the dip is so hard as it contradicts confirmation that you are wrong each time when the price goes to the new low and it's better to stay away from it.

@_date: 2017-11-15 19:13:57
Yes or No. Bitcoin has the same feature with Ponzi scheme that both are heavily rewarding the earlier comers. The gain of holders is purely from funding flow of new users. Besides, Bitcoin system does not generate profit internally. That's bankers arguments. On the other hand, Bitcoin is great challenger of traditional financial orders thus dazzling surge in Bitcoin price is the trophy awarded on the war with bankers. We will be winning more that's why they fear.

Don't be pessimistic. It's a milestone for Bitcoin as it's recognized by mainstream in financial world. More professionals entering this market is good thing. I don't believe they are able to manipulate the price if they don't involve in mining business. It's less dangerous than as Jihan miner cartels.

Actually having many diehard of bitcoin is good thing for the community and growth of its future,comparing with religion like Islam, there is a long way to go. On the other hand, many people keep doubt and critical about it, because they don't know the human nature well, however advantage the tech is developed, it finally serves for human demands, met the psychology needs in depth. Bitcoin is creating the belief for those who feel angry with old financial order and need a real change and building the global network for that belief. You can think of it as digital unbreakable religion for next couples of decades to make it easier understand. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 08:48:17

It is not friendly towards bitcoin. Maybe break the common brief that the price is going up forever by producing man-made bear market.

@_date: 2017-11-22 10:12:18
Don't be fooled by the word 'Bubble'. Any great disruptive invention growing from zero to giant is definitely going through a lot of turbulences. Bitcoin is creating a brand new form of economy that will change very aspect of the society. It once survived from a 90% drop down turmoil which you see its great resilient. Don't worry, it's still only in the premature stage. Too earlier to say the 'bubble' to burst.
