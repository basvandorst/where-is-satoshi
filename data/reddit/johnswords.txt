Their commerce engine was custom built for many years.  It's possible it's difficult to integrate.

The problem with product ratings and reviews is that they need to be collected a few weeks after the money is transacted. I'm not aware of any way to amend a transaction with this information. It would be nice if it didn't require making dust in the blockchain.  Any other ideas how it could be done without a separate shared message store?

I posted [this]( last week with marketplaces in mind but now I'm thinking a bit broader in a decentralized web stack that could be used for really any type of database driven web application including but not limited to marketplaces.

Projects like BitMessage are on their way to making email trustless and decentralized and BitCoin already does it to banking, so why not, I say.

Ok, sorry.  I said I didn't want to argue about the merits of credit and I started an argument about credit :)  What I really want to know is how the community expects broad Bitcoin adoption as a currency to occur (not as a store of wealth) when the vast majority of the world's economic activity is credit and not currency today.  The amount of friction is vast, so what's the path to adoption as a currency?

Yes, it would be a browser/messaging client riding on a P2P protocol that would replace eBay, Craigslist, Monster.com, PirateBay, and Silk Road.  But it could also power other types of web experiences. 
I envision users would launch an app that would act as a hybrid browser/local server that would synchronize catalog items, user reputation, escrow balances, PMs, etc. and give the user the ability to browse all of this content like a website but have it served from their computer instead of a central server.  
To the end user, it would be as simple as opening a web browser and shopping but behind the scenes there would be a lot of moving parts.

You don't think it would be less easy for them to track down if there's no marketplace organization to subpoena?

The FBI forced Linden Lab to ban gambling in Second Life and there was a crackdown on money laundering.  The CIA also operated in Second Life.  There were Senate hearings where the CEO of Linden Lab sat before Congress too.

Consumer adoption and promoters's ignorance are the parallels to be drawn here, not platform architecture.
Bitcoin is really two things, it's a transactional protocol and it is a store of value/currency hybrid.  Its protocol is very novel and I think we'll see elements of its shared message store design in other things for years to come. In terms of the value it is providing as a store of value and currency, I think it's way too early to make any judgements. 
For consumers -- it's made some people rich, it's made some people save more, and no doubt its ideology has indoctrinated many. But the currency component of Bitcoin has also taken away significant value from people who have lost their wallet keys, confused people because the learning curve and software is not self evident, and it has blindsided people with wild fluctuations in its exchange rate value which is so vital to getting people to convert.  
For merchants -- the very, very few merchants that do accept Bitcoin are opting to convert receipts to fiat immediately which backs up its thus far inability to pay for things and 
For economic growth - the Bitcoin protocol's lack of an equally novel autonomous, programmatic solution to variable credit/debt makes it a non-starter as a replacement for fiat economies that create more wealth than economies like Bitcoin that are limited to finite productivity growth which would set us back centuries.
Second Life's Linden currency has been used by more people to transact both virtual and real goods at a rate Bitcoin has has not come close to. At its peak in speculation, 3rd party exchanges and active users, transactions on Second Life were approved within seconds, not hours or days like Bitcoin.
3D intellectual property licensing (including one video game that I'm aware of getting licensed), server hosting, telecom, gambling, 3d printing, &amp; real life gifts shipped to your door were just a few things Lindens could/can buy.   It was common for the technical/creative class of users in Second Life to make their sole income in Linden dollars, converting to fiat and using the rest to pay for their business expenses on the platform in Linden dollars.

None that I am aware of. As soon as Second Life garnered adequate attention for its wild west economic and user content policies, Linden Lab had to quickly pivot to stricter ToS or face serious consequences. 
Attempts to take the Second Life software, which was open source, and replicate what Linden Lab had created was never fully realized to the best of my knowledge.  It was not designed to be decentralized and obfuscating traffic through a service like TOR would ruin performance because of latency.
What Bitcoin hype shares most with Second Life hype are the barriers to mass user adoption and the myopic viewpoints of many of its proponents.  Historical examples and realities of the world are universally dismissed as though nothing.  
It's as though nothing in modern banking has merit (on the grounds it's not perfectly utopian??) and nothing that's ever happened on the Internet applies to Bitcoin.  Practical discussions are attacked with ideology and those of us that want to help are shushed away.

So you believe x is optimal while acknowledging the world is y.  I just can't accept that wishing the world to change to x is enough to ensure Bitcoin doesn't fizzle out.  Developing thoughtful ways to transition is key and no one seems to be working on it.

If you stripped out all the banking lending including the mortgages etc made on savings deposits up through the big capital markets financing and tried to replace that hole with term deposits (CD's) and ecosystem solutions like Kickstarter-for-Bitcoin, would we not absolutely lock up economic existence? Friends of mine who are here in NYC in finance say that the hit to the world economy would be jaw dropping.

I have used Wells Fargo SurePay (it's a white label of a third party service) and the biggest issue with it are the sending and receiving limits. It takes 3 days for transfers to go through too which is longer than an ACH or PayPal or Venmo.  I don't understand why anyone would use it long term once they realize how crippled it is.  
@_date: 2013-12-13 22:42:45
There's quite a bit more friction in a system that rules out debt and interest and replaces it with a only barter type trade of equity participation in exchange for resources. 
We are doing both systems at the present time and always have done both. We didn't arrive at this system out of ignorance either.  There is no example in recorded history for the utopian conditions you are describing where an economy based solely on productivity growth exceeds the growth of one with debt and interest.  If there was, it would have been considered.
Bitcoin faces a hard enough up hill battle as it is for adoption, but this added friction may very well choke it to death.

This solution is likely broader than a single marketplace but rather a stack for hosting distributed websites of any kind (with a basic feature set to start of course).  With that in mind, does a separate blockchain for each site make sense or is there possibly a provision in existing designs to isolate them for end user storage/efficiency?
I also had the thought to offload site assets as torrents.  A BitTorrent-as-CDN solution for assets that don't require the security and the replication to every user of a site would help make the blockchain a more manageable size for each of the sites, but it does add the complication of needing to figure out how to reward peers for seeding torrents.

Before you down vote, I think most of what is in here can easily be refuted.  I'm posting because I'd like to hear others' take on how Bitcoin and its ecosystem can answer to the argument that Brian makes about leverage, loans and interest payments?  Is it really just as simple Bitcoin prints those 25 coins every 10 minutes and lending is handled through the eco system using actual coins?

It's been a while since I received a payment on it but I'm pretty sure you have to sign up for a service, link your bank account, and then the funds are transferred to you.  The email address and name on the linked bank account must match what you enter when you send.

The interaction during these hearings indicated nothing about the intentions of the legislature ...until the very end today.  
In the last 20 minutes of the hearing, the most recognizable Senator in attendance, Chuck Schumer, spoke out in favor of additional regulations and gave those testifying homework on how to better regulate Bitcoin against its use in illegal activity.  Those testifying have up to a week to enter in their responses in the public record for the hearing.  It will be interesting to see their responses, but more interesting to see what the legislature does next.

I was very involved in the Second Life bubble as a technical producer and in the role of business development.  I was also involved with the platform as an entrepreneur leveraging its virtual currency.
Immersive 3D was thoroughly being vetted as *the* mass consumer "window manager" and user experience for computers by many major players in tech.  In 2003, the idea of 3D was shiny again after failed attempts at virtual reality in the mid 1990s.  But more importantly, virtual world interfaces had the backing of hardware companies looking for ways to sell more graphics cards and PCs just prior to the mobile/tablet explosion.  
The achilles heel of immersive environments for mass consumption at that time was that 70-80% of consumers: 
1. could not get past the sign up process, which took most users 15+ minutes to download and learn the UI  
2. did not have the necessary graphics hardware, memory, or fast enough Internet connectivity to make the experience enjoyable, or even usable, for that matter.
Forget for a moment whether immersive environments and virtual currency were what the world needed at the time -- consumers could not even get through the time investment to figure out if they even liked it.
I ask all of you -- how many minutes did you spend researching, setting up, and making your first transaction in Bitcoin?  It was more than 1-2 minutes, it was too long. Some may argue 30 seconds is too long.  If you answer less than 2 minutes, then I imagine there's a good chance your wallet is vulnerable or there's some other major inefficiency in your experience that will cause a mass consumer to just outright abandon Bitcoin.
Bitcoin's friction points toward mass adoption are pretty steep. It is true that most people have the requisite technology assets to participate in Bitcoin unlike immersive 3D, but that doesn't solve it.  The wallet software is not dummy-proof or like anything most people have used, transactions can take as long as ACH/wires to confirm, it faces obstacles by recent and forthcoming government regulation, it's banned on popular mobile devices (my mom does not jailbreak her phone, sorry), mainstream media coverage consists mostly of Bitcoin's use in illegal activity.  
If Dogecoin becomes the LOLcats of currency, it very likely could surpass Bitcoin in awareness and participation as the world's meme currency.  This could cause the mass market to miss the point about the vast infrastructure that Bitcoin proponents have invested in that is missing from the other crypto currencies. 
Then there is the whole issue of whether Bitcoin must compete with fiat currencies that use extreme levels of credit/debt to spur on economic wealth or if it can just co-exist with fiat and still play a major role as a transaction platform and/or store of wealth.

BitWasp looks to be an open source cryptocurrency marketplace but from what I've heard from others in the community, there's no P2P element to it so its still dependent on a server.  If anyone reading this knows more about the status or use of BitWasp in the proposed "SR 2.0", I'd like to hear more about how its being used.

Yeah, I'm thinking its a client that offers a browser on the frontend and is running a local web server stack that processes the shared message store and to generate the catalog browsing experience.
More broadly, this is a model for rendering web experiences that takes the biggest remaining "middleman" and trust point out of the picture. 
I think this is important work.  
If it turns out this is a new approach and there's not already a group working on it, I will be looking for developers and community members to help formalize a group to make it happen.

Many reasons. Credit is not fixed and it is not automatically inflationary.
