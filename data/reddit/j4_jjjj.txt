AFAIK, this proposal would reverse all dynamic token encryption. Meaning all companies would need 1 to a few encryption tokens to apply for all https traffic and hardware encryption. The benefit for the government is that they can requisition these keys at any time and decrypt any message or device on a moment's notice. The downside is that with only a small number of keys, the bad guys could potentially break any system.
If I'm wrong here, please correct me. I typed this to make sure I understood as well.

I'm not advocating for btc. I'm advocating for atomic swaps with ltc and/or dgb

With block chain technology, it is better. And there's no reason (other than political corruption) that crypto can't replace centralized banks.

Banks do not equal the government. Please don't put words in my mouth

Nope, just those crypto currencies that support banks. That's not what crypto was made for.

Lots of people were led to believe BCH would be a giant dumpster fire, so they sold after the fork. Now they're entrenched against it no matter what.
I hodl. Still have BTG too, lost money there by not selling early. However, the gains from BCH are higher than the loss on BTG so I'm still net positive on hodling.
@_date: 2018-05-06 13:50:43
Whoever sold their BCH before it hit $1600+
@_date: 2018-05-01 12:33:12
So you're mad that he called BTC 'core' after months of BTC supporters calling BCH btrash and bcash?
@_date: 2018-05-01 16:45:25
Out of genuine curiosity, what makes you say these things/makes you think they are the most important factors?
* "he funds projects" - lots of people fund projects. is he the  funder in BCH? if so, proof?
* "colludes with miners" - links for this?
* "engages in business activity for bitcoin cash" - He also engages in BTC activity. His site sells and promotes BTC as well as BCH.
I don't give a shit one way or the other about Ver. If he truly is the terrible person this sub makes him out to be, then he should DIAF. My problem is that I see a lot of rhetoric with minimal factual backing. Every time I ask for proof of a statement, I'm met with downvotes and no sources.
@_date: 2018-05-01 20:37:53
I'm not asking to change my mind. I'm asking to provide proof of your claims. I have no mind to change, because I haven't made it up yet. 
Why is it out of the realm of possibility that you should have to back up anything you've said, when I genuinely would like to read about your claims?
And you say no attacks, while attacking. LOL.

How is BCH a scam?
@_date: 2018-05-06 12:50:39
How does holding a coin benefit it? Selling a coin makes a transaction, that adds benefit. You should have sent your BCH to the graveyard by sending it to a bad address if you want it to fail, not keep it in circulation by adding transactions.
@_date: 2018-05-28 13:13:05
There's no way they were banned for promoting btc. It was way worse I bet.
@_date: 2018-05-01 21:44:44
I'm just trying to have dialogue, but of course that makes me a Ver shill. Agree completely about the BCH as Bitcoin thing. But theres just a lot of ferventness instead of discourse.
@_date: 2018-05-01 14:32:48
I'm not siding with anyone. He owns a website, there's no business owner of BTC or BCH, so sounds like all the BTC hardliners are just as stompy and crying as Ver.
@_date: 2018-05-01 13:40:20
That is a website, not the coin itself.
@_date: 2018-05-28 14:07:24
What makes bch a scam?
@_date: 2018-05-01 20:32:01
Switch to attack mode when you can't provide evidence. Solid strategy. Just like t_d's!
@_date: 2018-05-01 14:00:00
You think BTC is faster and cheaper than BCH? I'm confused....
@_date: 2018-05-03 17:58:15
What sub isn't? (Serious question)
@_date: 2018-05-01 20:29:55
Thats pretty flimsy, still no sources to back up your claims.
@_date: 2018-05-01 13:46:10
What's funny is all your arguments are how X coin is better than BCH, but not once was BTC the better coin in your examples. Do you think that is a problem? Why jump to altcoins instead of using BTC?
@_date: 2018-05-01 17:27:18
Anyone that believes in crypto more than "my coin is better than yours"
@_date: 2018-05-01 14:34:31
It's inherently, thanks to facts, false. Unless of course you have some evidence I'm unaware of. Please link if so.
@_date: 2018-05-01 13:31:17
Can you explain the "cannot succeed" and "relies on BTC to fail" parts?
@_date: 2018-05-01 12:31:32
Fighting each other is pointless. Working together, making strides that challenge each other, and NOT MUDSLINGING is how *both* coins can succeed. 
But that's never gonna happen as long as it's a team sport.

I was going by this quote, which is unclear whether they are controlling all OS types, or simply have malware for all OS types.
malware != backdoor
@_date: 2017-03-07 15:39:50
Yes, but not the corporate flavors that Samsung and other major Android makers use.
@_date: 2017-02-14 07:48:14
Fuck node.
Good work though. I made a python script to pull from local btc and text me if the price dropped a certain percentage.
@_date: 2017-03-07 15:24:09
Yeah, something that fingerprints services running on a Linux box is not the same as a complete backdoor into a Windows machine.
@_date: 2017-03-07 15:22:24
Probably referring to Android (Linux), but not sure.
@_date: 2017-01-05 13:22:30
localBTC still around 950USD

The fact that there are Chinese elite proves they aren't actually communist. Checkmate atheists!

Used to be that way. And not that long ago, either. The norm changed, especially around the 80s.
@_date: 2017-08-08 12:59:09
For retailers, it's about 3-3.5% depending on which card issuer is swiped. But the transaction is confirmed in 5 seconds, so there's a trade-off there.
@_date: 2018-06-07 14:23:25
Theoretically, you shouldn't need loans to live. But the wealthy elite make sure we have to pay interest on living. Crypto provides a way to take the power back a bit.
@_date: 2017-08-19 14:24:47
I know, right? Why do I have to pick sides? I just want to make money.
@_date: 2018-06-11 13:37:33
I didn't see any double spends that were both confirmed. Maybe I'm missing something?
@_date: 2018-06-07 16:27:31
Have an economy where people can save for several/a few years to buy a house. But that requires paying people ***a living wage*** and a fair wage. We have to get the former before the latter, though.
@_date: 2017-04-08 09:26:07
This is probably the most true statement, actually.
@_date: 2017-04-08 09:30:16
The feuding between these 2 subs is ludicrously inane and irrelevant to advancing bitcoin.
All I want is informed opinions and actual data. But the most upvoted posts I see on r/btc ***AND*** r/bitcoin are complaining about the other sub and namecalling temper tantrums.
Let's grow up and discuss topics.
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:20:18
You are conveniently leaving out that it did not start as a penal colony, as you had stated previously.
The colonies were already being established, and the convicts were being sold to plantation owners as indentured servants, mostly in VA and MD. All of this occurred during the 18th century (from your source), and as such would have been at least 100 years, if not more, since the first Americans ***FLEEING RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION*** came to the shores of the New World.
@_date: 2017-09-20 13:06:47
I agree with this argument 100%.
But, I have never seen it before. Are you sure this was a taking point prior? Most of the arguments against big blocks were "fuck you! small blocks or gtfo".
At least, in here I mean
@_date: 2017-09-02 14:23:35
Second for this one. Sucks initially if you have a lot of different coins though.
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:34:48
Whatever perceived hostility you imagined is not there. I simply felt the need to emphasize the factual beginnings of my "precious country".
Even if you were not the original commenter, adding the reference link shows you agreed and are now trying to backtrack your stance.
People have a hard time admitting they were wrong.
@_date: 2017-09-07 12:27:20
Serious question, can you eli5 the tricks banks use?
@_date: 2017-09-13 12:18:55
Localbtc is always high. Use Gemini or coinbase as a metric instead.
@_date: 2017-09-13 12:56:25
For inflated values, sure. But it's not accurate to the true "going price".

Where do you live that USD has no value?
@_date: 2017-07-25 12:23:58
It's hard to find real opinions in this thread because you copy paste the same 4 responses to every single person here. That's very disheartening for someone trying to gauge the actual sentiment of the community.

Most of the world. Fear mongering and manipulation of ideologies over generations has created societies that have purely "us vs them" mentalities. This leads to fighting over exchange of ideas, more often than not.

@_date: 2017-05-24 22:30:41
That's fair, definitely from a percentage standpoint there has been similar swings. But not from a USD standpoint (which is where my head was at the time)
@_date: 2017-05-24 20:11:45
There has never been a swing like this before. I don't know how you can say that with such certainty.
