It was a movie released this year that barely grossed a half million dollars worldwide. Apparently the thieves just sawed the safe off the foundation.

By that logic, if the price goes down by a dollar, that's $13 million that's gone. 
If bitcoin is an investment to you, you need the price compared to USD to go up or you're losing money. If you consider it an alternative currency, comparing it to USD doesn't mean much one way or the other.

If he buys infinite bitcoins now and sells whenever it reaches 1000 he will have infinite money!

I had a terrible experience with them as my auto insurance provider. I think people like USAA because they feel like they're in an exclusive club, when the reality is that just about everyone is somehow related to someone that was in the military.

Depends entirely what a dollar is worth. If you suddenly need 1000 bitcoins to buy what 1 bitcoin bought yesterday, yeah, the currency crashed/failed. That might correlate with what it's worth compared to USD, or it might not.
Bottom line is that if you're holding out for this to be a currency in the future, there's not really a point in following the conversion rate and assuring yourself that an increase/decrease/no change are all beneficial in the long run. It's irrelevant.

Bummer dude, but at least you get bragging rights.
Out of curiosity, did you buy a bitcoin already or were you waiting until you had actually lost the bet?
