I don't think mises misunderstood economics. Consumers want the state to get it's dirty hands out of the cookie jar. Historically money was created in the private sector. A decentralized currency could just be a natural evolution of money.

i thought no "central planning' is what made bitcoin different? the more I stop by reddit the more I know it's never going to be different. bitcoin already has this stench of a totalitarian, new world order currency with the programmable aspect and the coders refusing to eliminate the horrible, anti-freedom tracking aspect. what would you like to see next, the bitcoin central bank?

...around 28:30 Rog tells US citizens living abroad to renounce their citizenship sooner than later. "The only regret I have in regards to renouncing US citizenship myself is that I didn't do it sooner. I wish I would've done it a decade ago."

buying ANYTHING at the highs for the day, week, month, year, century...is a very bad idea. if bitcoin is going to be around forever, why do people think they are going to miss out on something?
