Whats the total price w black friday sale?

I feel like this is sticky-worthy. Probably one of the best videos explaining Bitcoin in terms the average Joe can understand

Can someone translate what it says on the screen?
@_date: 2016-12-07 14:49:30
So does Venmo, which 98% of people already use including myself and all my friends/family.
@_date: 2016-12-08 06:45:05
Woah, i was not even aware Facebook Messenger had a payment method..interesting. 
But FWIW, 9/10 people i come across use Venmo on a regular basis

Would like to know this as well.

Wait, so anyone, running a LN node, can benefit from fees collected? I was under the impression only miners benefited

If you think about it in those terms, its unfathomable to imagine what 1 Bitcoin would be worth..

Just signed up with them, but my bank wasn't listed in the options. Does this mean im only limited to wire transfers to fund my account, or should i wait and see until i am verified to see if they can verify my bank account so i can do ACH?
@_date: 2016-12-22 01:58:42
Wow i love that

So pretty much like LBC? Then I feel like this is a much better way to buy btc as opposed to LBC. Not sure if the same can be said for selling though (as stated by the risks of chargeback).

i thought this already started? anyone know if the first assignment was fixed?
@_date: 2016-12-10 04:21:22
Agreed. The only reason i sought interest in it was because of the ATH in 2013

So meaning, theres absolutely no reason for anyone to use Circle anymore?
Edit: something that no one has addressed yet: while the buying/selling functionality is no longer available, when you are "sending" money whether it be in USD, Euros, Pounds, or in Bitcoin, how come it still gives the option to send Bitcoin? 
Also, the recipient area, still indicates you can send to a Bitcoin address. If someone wants to test this, trying "sending" a few dollars in USD to a btc address they use and update us
Edit 2: just tried "sending" money to a bitcoin address but no longer works. Don't see any reason to use Circle anymore unfortunately

How would this work out on BitSquare? Because, from what i understand, people can only transact fiat via Bank Transfers?
@_date: 2016-12-01 14:59:33
While that won't likely happen in our lifetime, its important to understand how undervalued Bitcoin is right now at its current price
