That's as useful as saying 1 US dollar is still worth 1 US dollar.  It's interesting that the bitcoin kids love to bash "fiat" because it loses purchasing power over time but claim a loss of purchasing power for bitcoins is ok.  They are both bad for the exact same reason.  Stop being hypocrites.  
One month ago you could have exchanged 1 bitcoin for a brand new 2018 Honda Civic.  Earlier today that same single bitcoin now only pays for one half of the civic.  You've lost 50% of your purchasing power in 1 month.

"payed" is something you do to the deck of a boat.  The past tense of pay is paid.
Imagine for a moment you could earn $150/month mining coins, but the electricity bill went up by $150/month.  I hope you realize that is the same as going to your parents and asking them for $150/month to do absolutely nothing and skipping the whole mining operation.
You aren't creating any wealth.  It's nothing more than a transfer payment from the person paying the electric bill to you.

If you do this again next week when bitcoin was at $6,500 then bitcoin will have a negative return over the last 12 months.  By the time we get to mid December and look at one year returns for bitcoin the numbers will likely be -70% for bitcoin.
Also, the US Dollar Index over the last year is +2.39%.  Using your numbers bitcoin is +4.3% during that same time frame.  Again if we look at the numbers next week the USDI will still be positive and bitcoin negative.  By December the USDI will still likely be positive and bitcoin returns will be terrible.

This depends entirely at what price you entered the market.
If you bought in at $100 then yes $7k puts you miles ahead where you started.  Of course when it was at $20k you had 3 times as much money as you do now, but those are still very solid gains.
What if you bought at $7k last November and held until now?  You watched your money nearly triple on the way up from $7k to $20k and watched every single cent of gains disappear on the ride back down to $7k again.  These people probably lament not selling at the peak instead of thinking that $7k is a great price.
Now imagine you bought in at 10k, 12k, 15k, 18k or even 19.9k.  How do you feel about a $7k price point now?  Most people in that boat aren't too excited about btc at the $7k level.

No it can't.  Both gold and real estate have intrinsic value.  Bitcoins are 1s and 0s on a hard drive.  Nothing more.  They are actually worse than the much maligned "FIAT" precisely because they are not supported by government.  The fact that the IRS won't accept payments in gold or bitcoins and demands US dollars is not a trivial point.


This sort of bullshit isn't intrinsic value.  In fact that doesn't even represent bitcoin:  the above statement describes the blockchain technology which is totally different from an actual bitcoin.  The bitcoin is given out for verifying the transactions on the "global decentralized immutable ledger."
People on this sub complain loudly that "FIAT" is evil due to its inflationary nature as practiced by most central banks.  What they can't come to terms with is that bitcoins have the opposite problem of being deflationary due to the hard cap of 21 million.  They don't grasp the ramifications of this because they haven't a modicum of understanding of finance, macro economics, or the important traits of an effective medium of exchange.
Both inflation **AND** deflation are very damaging to an economy.  Replacing one with the other is not a solution to the problem.  Simply because "FIAT" is bad and bitcoin is not fiat doesn't automatically make bitcoin better.

You do not understand the term "intrinsic value."  Gold has value because it can be made into jewelry and worn.  It's used in many industrial settings and your computer and your phone both have some amount of gold in them.  It has a large number of uses.  Real estate can be farmed, mined, logged, and lived on.  Transaction "security" is not intrinsic value no matter how twisted your logic.
Land has scarcity.  Gold has scarcity. Bitcoin via the protocol has scarcity.  Scarcity doesn't not automatically equate to value.  There are many things that are scarce that have no value whatsoever.


You don't not understand deflation.  There are currently 17m bitcoins.  The cap that is baked into the protocol is 21m. 
17,000,000 x 1.0396 =  
* 17,673,200 in 1 year. 
* 18,373,058 in 2 years.
* 19,100,631 in 3 years.
* 19,857,016 in 4 years.
* 20,643,354 in 5 years.
* 21,460,831 in 6 years.
at 3.96% annual growth the 21m cap is exhausted in 6 years.  Afterwards bitcoins become deflationary even by your math.  Of course they won't actually be mined that fast because the rate of new coins introduced is being lowered repeatedly.  The real growth is only 3.96% **today**.  You are taking snapshot growth and extrapolating it out to infinity in a futile attempt to pretend it's not deflationary.  You are either ignorant of the math or intentionally trying to mislead.  As soon as the growth rate is lower than global GDP it becomes deflationary.  Period.  **You cannot have a cap on the total number of units of currency and positive GDP without creating deflation.**

It's not **your** money.  When you spend money with a credit card it's the **bank's** money you are spending.  When you borrow money for student loans that is also the **bank's** money when you spend it on cryptos.  


They are in the business of making money not losing it.  When you default on a loan they lose money.  When they are the the ones loaning out their money they are free to put whatever restrictions they want on it.
They have likely figured out that lending money to people to buy cryptos is very high risk with very little upside for them.  People probably borrow the money and if cryptos go up they pay back the loan and if cryptos tank they simply walk away letting the bank hold the bag.
You can buy cryptos with cash, ACH transfers, wire transfers, and debit cards.  The banks are in no way keeping you from spending your own money on cryptos.  They are prohibiting people from spending the bank's money on cryptos.

Bitcoin breached $5,900 on February 5th.  That is a 70% decline from the all time high of $19,989 back in December.  Earlier today it was sub $8,000.  That's still down 60% from the all time high.
If it has declined 70% it can decline 80% or 90% or even 95%.  There is nothing underpinning the price.  Usually when evaluating stocks you look at the underlying value of the company, inventory, real estate, their cash flow, etc.  In this case there is zero value.  It's 100% speculation.

Prices are way down. Bitcoin peaked at roughly $19.9k in December and has traded as low as $5.8k which is more than a 70% decline.  At $8k it's still down 60% from the peak.  All gains from the last 4+ months are now gone.  
The other cryptos are also down.  Bitcoin keywords on google trends have closely followed price.  Since December searches for bitcoin have plummeted.  Daily trade volume has also tanked.
I don't think there's been a capitulation event yet.  There are still a lot of people at this point hoping and praying it will go to $1m.  Reality hasn't set in yet.  I'm not sure what price floor it has to break through for a majority of bitcoin holders to finally throw in the towel.
There is a point though whether that is $5k or $4k or some other price where the confidence in bitcoin will collapse and there will be a very sharp selloff.  This will be capitulation.  As much as the bitcoin people hate "FIAT" both are underpinned by little more than public confidence.  Once that erodes they both become worthless.

This is another stupid bitcoin saying.
Assume you went to a casino and took $1k USD to the table and started playing.  Assume you lost $500 over some number of hands.  Now the bitcoins kids say "you haven't lost until you cash out."  
In reality land you have already lost regardless whether you choose to continue sitting at the table or get up and walk away.  If you don't believe me that you have already incurred a loss try reaching across the felt and grabbing your $500 in chips out of the rack.  Watch how quickly you find yourself face down on the pavement with a knee in your back. 
If you bought bitcoin at $20k and are still holding it today at $7.7k you have suffered a $12.3k loss already.  It doesn't matter if you continue to hold the btc or sell.  It's the same loss either way.  The only thing selling does is lock in your loss permanently.  This doesn't mean the loss has not already occurred.
Otherwise people who still have Enron stock today could say "You haven't lost until you sell" even though there is zero chance they will ever recover their money.  Sure 1 share of enron stock = 1 share of enron stock, but that doesn't mean you haven't lost all of your money.

There are federal grants which also don't have to be paid back but they are usually only a small fraction of the total cost of schooling.  
Most of the costs end up being borrowed by the student (and to a lesser extent their parents).  Most of the time the loans cannot be discharged in a bankruptcy filing so once you take them out you are on the hook for good.  
In the states a student would be much better off using money from a credit card to buy cryptos instead of student loans because they can walk away from the CC debt in the event cryptos go to zero.  Both are terrible ideas, but the CC route is easier to get away from in the event of a crash.

The hard limit of 21 million coins is baked into the protocol.  Once those coins are mined that's it.
Inflation occurs when the growth in the money supply exceeds the growth in the economy.  This is typically (not not necessarily) what happens with most fiat currencies because they can be printed without bounds.  This has a number of negative impacts on that economy and the people in it.
Deflation is where the growth in the money supply is lower than the growth in the economy.  This is the situation where bitcoin finds itself.  People erroneously believe that inflation = evil and deflation = good.  Deflation also has many negative consequences that people on this sub reddit want to pretend don't exist.
Going from USD to bitcoins merely trades one problem in for another. IE from an inflationary currency for a deflationary one.
Ideally you want neither inflation nor deflation.  You want the money supply to grow at roughly the same rate as the growth in economic output.  IE if global GDP is 4% then the money supply should grow by the same 4%.  This is not an easy task.  Bitcoin can never accomplish this because the person who designed it probably didn't understand the perils of deflation and designed it with a hard cap.

Please link an article from a reputable source that says BofA no longer allows coinbase transactions.  They stated they will no longer allow **credit card** transactions.  You can still buy via ACH, debit card, or wire transfer using BofA.
Many other banks have taken the exact same stance of no longer allowing bitcoin purchases with their credit cards.  They have not banned bitcoin purchases.  They no longer wish to fuel gambling on bitcoins.  Seeings how it's their money they get to set the terms of what you are allowed to use it for.

No, what's so bullshit is you trying to dictate to them how they spend **their** money.


It's not your money.  When you make a transaction on your credit card you are spending the bank's money.  They are fronting the cash.  The bank has no way to know if you plan to pay the balance in full at the end of the month or if you plan to walk away if the price of btc tanks.  They are also assuming all the risk.  If you fail to pay they are the one out the cash, not you.  
Again you can buy bitcoins with cash, via ACH, wire transfer, or use your debit card.  In all those cases it's your money being used to facilitate the transaction.

If you look at past bubbles toward the end they are often fueled by people "investing" with borrowed money.  If that's not a warning sign I don't know what is. 
That money belongs to the bank, not you.  They can rescind their offer of credit to you for whatever reason they like.
Yes the banks want you to go into debt and stay there. They do not, however, want you to **default** on that debt.  If you stop paying each month they lose money.  My guess is the banks are already seeing high default rates of people who used their credit cards to "invest" in bitcoin and they are now moving to hedge against further losses.
People have probably been using their credit cards to "free roll" on bitcoin.  If the prices doubles they repay the bank and have a big pile of cash with zero risk.  If the price goes down they just default on the credit card leaving the bank with the loss.
If you can't buy bitcoins via ACH, debit card, or wire transfer then you have no business "investing" in the first place.

We know via the protocol that the number of bitcoins will go up between now and the end of 2020.  Every new bitcoin created makes his prediction that much more outlandish.
Assuming there is no recession in the US from now through the end of 2020 total US GDP by then will also be higher.
I can't tell you the exact numbers for either, but his predicted valuation for bitcoin at the end of 2020 will be roughly 100% of GDP.
The fact that people won't even point out how completely absurd his valuation is and at the same time use his valuation as proof that bitcoin is going places is beyond sad.

If there was 5 times as many buyers as sellers then the price would be rising not falling.
There has been a tremendous amount of manipulation on both sides of the equation both on the way up and on the way down.
True enough there have been huge buy orders at key levels like $9,000 $8,500 $8,400 and so on.  You can see the buy orders in the order book.  Many times though as soon as the clearing price approaches the key level (say the price gets down to $8,500.01) the buy order disappears.  Not because it clears, but because it was removed.  It is obvious when you look at the trade history because that block of btc was never actually transacted.  
That particular manipulation is trying to give the impression that there is a lot of demand and support at key levels in an attempt to put a floor under the price to stabilize it against further declines.
This is one result of having a currency that is beyond the reach of government regulators.  Sure they cannot control the currency, but that also means you lose all protections and oversight.  You end up with the wild west.

I totally agree with you.  Even though the eventual price point for bitcoin is something very close to zero, markets almost never move in straight lines.  This will be a "random downward walk."  Unless there is a capitulation event where the price could collapse the rest of the way in a very short period of time.
I too think it's way oversold at the moment and will likely have a bounce (or 3) in the near term.  There's definitely money to be make on trading the dead cat bounce in a very clear downward trend, but i'm not skilled enough to time it and come out ahead.

You can still buy bitcoins from any of the these same banks using ACH transactions, debit cards, or wire transfers.
This isn't a grand conspiracy by the banks to undermine bitcoin.  A credit card is a loan by the bank.  They are free to change the terms of their offered line of credit at any time for any reason.  
This is most likely a result of lots of people buying bitcoins with money they do not have hoping to get rich overnight.  Now that bitcoin is down more than 60% from the December highs the banks are probably already seeing significant numbers of defaults and don't wish to take further losses.
This change will only affect people who don't have their own money to buy bitcoins and were trying to borrow it to "invest."

If you have student loans you already can't afford to be investing.

The price doesn't have to go to zero for bitcoin to be dead.  Many publicly traded companies that file for bankruptcy and dissolve still have stocks that trade slightly above zero.
At $200 bitcoin would be down 99% from the nominal peak and still not zero.  Sure it might be worth $200 but at that point the chances of it replacing the US dollar or Chuck E Cheese token is zero.

Bullshit. The Dow was down to 6,500 as recently as 2009.  Stocks were extremely cheap then.  It has traded above 26,000 this year.  That's 4 fold in 9 years.  2009 isn't the 1980s.


No one is forcing you take out those student loans.  There are other options besides getting a degree feminist dance therapy.  What really confuses me is that students complain about predatory loans from banks, but aren't protesting the college book stores selling them $500 text books.  The banks aren't setting the prices of those books the universities are.  Books aren't even needed and they could be distributed via free pdf files.  yet students aren't even protesting cutting down trees to print the books.  It's as if universities somehow get a free pass against any sort of criticism.  This misplaced anger at the banks when it should be at the schools amazes me.


These $15/hr minimum wages are popping up everywhere.  


100% false.  There are lots of alternatives besides an overpriced and totally worthless college education for most majors.


Here in the states taking your student loan money to spend on things totally unrelated to school is against the terms of those loans in pretty much all cases.  Plus it's a terrible idea to "invest" with borrowed money.

In the last 4 years bitcoin was positive twice during the month of April and negative twice.  
So there's a 50% chance it will go up this month and a 50% chance it will go down?  It looks like we have a 100% chance of history repeating itself here.

My favorite bitcoin myths:
* it's an excellent store of value
* it works well as a medium of exchange
* it has intrinsic value
* it is much more egalitarian than "FIAT"
* bitcoin revolution will smash the 1% hoarding all the wealth
* transactions are are a cheap and fast with bitcoin as swiping your visa card with fiat dollars
* energy consumption doesn't matter because &lt;reason&gt;
@_date: 2018-04-02 18:10:43
Your entire analysis is an attempt to spot **monthly** "trends" in 4 years worth of data.  If it's stupid for me to choose the month of April, then it's equally stupid to pick out ***any*** month.  
First off, instead of doing just the last 4 years do this for the entire time bitcoin has been in existence.  Why choose 4 data points when there are larger data sets to use?  
Second, every single investment prospectus has language warning "past performance is no guarantee of future results" and yet you are trying to argue that "past performance is a guarantee of future results."
During the housing bubble right up to the point where it was beginning to implode the pundits kept saying "housing prices have never declined on a nationwide basis" as their argument that housing prices could not possibly go down.  Investments are not forward looking.  You can glean exactly zero useful information looking at past results.

Back in December when this chart was at its peak people in this sub cited it at "proof" that bitcoin was taking over.  Now that interest in bitcoin has tanked along with the price the same people now want to claim the graph is unimportant.
Only a small fraction of the population knows anything about bitcoin.  If it was continuing to grow in popularity the chart would be going up, not down.  Also of note is that the chart has been tracking the price.  The overwhelming majority of people searching for bitcoin weren't doing so because they want a replacement for the "FIAT" US dollar.  They were looking to get rich overnight.  Once it became clear that wasn't going to happen they lost interest.
Cognitive dissonance at its finest.
@_date: 2018-04-03 05:23:12
Correct it isn't a stock.  In fact bitcoin isn't an investment at all.  When you buy stocks, bonds, and other equities you are lending money to a company to make capital investments.  Maybe they construct a new building, buy equipment, tools, vehicles, etc.
The goal is that they use that money to generate higher returns by which the investor one day can get back their principal plus a reasonable return from higher stock prices, dividends, coupons, etc.
Bitcoin has none of those qualities.  You possess a bitcoin which is nothing more than ones and zeros on a hard drive somewhere and hope that someone will pay more than you did for it via speculation.

From the all time high of $19,900 back in December 2017 we are currently at $6,800.  Thus we are down nearly 66% from the peak.  We are still near the low of $5,800 of early February 2018.

Let's have an honest discussion shall we?  
Point A) that's $3/transaction.  Sure if you take out $20 and pay $3 you are paying 15%.  That $3 is fixed though.  If you take out $100 the fee is 3%.  If you take out $300 the fee is now 1%.
Point B) there are lots of fee free ATMs out there.  My ATM cards work at thousands of ATMs and I pay zero fees.   You can avoid fees if you want to.  Where are the 0% bitcoin ATMs at?  That's right they don't exist.
Point C) He stated 6.5% **and** "shadowy market value" which means they are giving you a shit exchange rate to further pad their fees.
Point D) The one point of bitcoins is to get away from a faceless corporation separating you from your hard earned cash and now you are bending over backwards to defend a faceless corporation separating you from your hard earned cash.  Bitcoin needs to be **better** than the alternatives.  If your defense revolves around "but this other thing sucks too" then your egalitarian currency revolution is going to fail.

And 1 Venezuelan Bolivar is still equal to 1 Venezuelan Bolivar.  Comparing a unit of account to itself is beyond stupid.  The important metric is purchasing power.
1 Bolivar still equals 1 Bolivar but it has lost nearly all of its purchasing power.  That's why no one wants to hold Bolivars anymore.  BTC has lost almost 83% of its purchasing power.  Claiming that doesn't matter because 1 BTC still equals 1 BTC is delusional.

BTC traded as high as $19,898 on coinbase on December 17, 2017.  Moments ago it was trading at $3,413.  1 - 3413/19898 = 82.85% decline from the ***all time high***.


Bullshit.  Nearly everyone who piled into BTC did so only because they thought they were going to get rich quick.  Their arguments for owning BTC have only pivoted because the price has tanked and they need a new justification for owning them.


You need to go to your local community college and enroll into a class on entry level macro economics. The correct phrase you are looking for is "purchasing power."  BTC has lost 83% of its purchasing power over the last 12 months.  The fact that you don't want to believe or cannot comprehend it is astonishing.
If the US dollar lost 83% of its purchasing power over a 12 month period this sub would be full of posts as "proof" that fiat is doomed and it's time to buy btc.  When the shoe is on the other foot suddenly the argument becomes "1 btc still equals 1 btc."

This is more stupid shit you got from a youtube video of your favorite bitcoin "expert." As markets grow in size and mature the volatility should go down.  Sure BTC has multiple declines in excess of 80% but that was at a time when the total pool of both people and money was much smaller.  
The total number of market participants and money grew exponentially.  Thus the volatility should have declined inversely.  When there is more money and people it's much hard to manipulate a market.  The swings should become much less severe.
We are not seeing that with BTC.  We are currently down nearly 83% from the ATH.  Sure there were I believe two other cycles where BTCs top to bottom decline was greater than 83% but again that was in a significantly smaller market. 
Pretending that this 83% decline has not done ***substantial*** damage to BTCs public image and confidence by the population at large is just willful ignorance.
