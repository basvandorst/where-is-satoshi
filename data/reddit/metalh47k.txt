Wait... So they are selling what was stolen from users back to the users? What a reach around.

Your tweet was already mentioned in the comment you replied to. 
Post a picture of you confirming your twitter account with today's newspaper to legitimise your twitter and reddit accounts. Slush's tweet and the 'fotoforensics' don't do you any favours.

I am currently in build mode to create a short term deposit system/bank that you will deposit funds into and it will earn interest. 
Nothing officially released about it as we are still in the build mode and still working out how this can benefit the public and ourselves to prevent us going under, but I have bought the domains and I'm raising funds to make sure its has all the right protection from DDOS and appropriate fail-over. I can't tell you much more bar its in development. It will be Australian based.
I have an very rough eta of early next year (I have left some lead way for some setbacks along the way.) 
My team will post something official about this about the ~August mark.
All I can tell you now is that its in development.

Before I elaborate, we have just started drawing up plans its still very much in the pipelines when it comes to the plan.
We will be generating BTCs through multiple routes:
EDIT: I originally typed this all out but to curb competition start ups I will stick to bullet points.
1. We (Yet to register a company name) have a 26GH farm of GPU miners. 
2. We have a big order for BFL ASICs hence why we have pushed out starting time right back to next year. 
3. Trading
4. Pooled Mining Deals/Collaborations.
As you can imagine the infrastructure for such endeavour is quite demanding and complicated.  
As for what we offer; I'll let you know closer to the date. 
At this point small loans are a possibility. The challenges around this is non repayment; a lot of bots applying for loans; Customer verification. In other words accountability for loans would be a huge concern of ours.

well played sir.

ASIC's will ramp the difficulty up. People who haven't already made the switch to litecoin will. GPU mining in litecoin will increase the difficulty of it to close to where Bitcoin is now. 
GPU Mining will live on be be viable, maybe not through Bitcoin but through other cyptocurrencies . :)

I really rate coinjar, I have made a 3k withdrawal with no problems.
@_date: 2013-05-15 23:39:55
Move to LiteCoin. Thus far its ASIC safe.
