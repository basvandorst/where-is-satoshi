You don't get invited to a lot of parties, do you?

At first glance, I thought the image was a picture of lego..

It's the bitcon!

Dupe, sorry man..

I think they are going to try to sell phones and stuff with this chip installed, marketing it as keeping bitcoin alive.  
People will be fine with the chip installed since the energy consumption is insignificant. However this also means the amount of satoshis found is insignificant. Thus, the buyers wouldn't care if they get the satoshis or not, meaning 21dotco will keep them. And for them the yield is significant because they want to sell thousands of these chips.

All of those are needed, including mainstream acceptation. The one can't be achieved without the other.

Whatever we do, it will take years before it happens (if it happens at all).  
But there is a difference between chasing them away with conspiracy theories and trying to get 'm on board.

"stagnation means decline"  
Growth is necessary, which can only be achieved by getting mainstream people to hop on.

Maybe the regulations in The Netherlands are well arranged, but I have never heard of anyone who was actually locked out.

Fair point ;)  
But that still isn't the result of some conspiracy. It's a result of a lacking liquidity.

I agree partially with you. For national (or SEPA) transaction, the conventional system might be easier.  
However transferring money from Europe to the USA, for example, is a real pain in the ass, and an expensive pain.

Well, actually not. If the government prints more money, the value of a dollar decreases (inflation) and thus the value of the total debt becomes less.

Kraken is available for the entire SEPA.
