One thing I'm learning (and appreciating) about this community is that they tend to be *relatively* level-headed when it comes to Trump - not your typical me-too hysterical diaper-pooping CNN-watching crowd (except in airports).

The ol' bastard doesn't appear to have much time left, god willing.

The wife will NEVER find out.
And the only thing that matter is the price you SELL at, so STFU and stop moaning.

"Some of those "losers" are using TA to help them make money in a bear market"
Yes, and more of them are LOSING money. Guess which of these groups makes Youtube channels and starts enthusiastic threads on Reddit!
The market is IMPOSSIBLE to predict in the short term (insider knowledge aside).
To be fair, it's impossible to predict in the long term too - but at least by HODLing you free yourself time to get on with more important things in life.

TA is for losers. Literally.
Sporadically buy what you can when people are shitting their pants. Apart from that wait for five years and see where you are. Stop wasting time and get on with your lives.

As I explained, the purpose of buying a coin wouldn't be investment ;)

"you were sounding out your hyper-partisan opinions on reddit."
THE HORROR!!!

You take gentle trolling *far* too seriously.

I'd just buy one to annoy liberals.

BCash. I like the ring of that.

How old are you? If you are under 35, this is all a learning experience that serves to make you stronger. So STFU.

To be honest the thing it reminds me of most closely is the Big Bang.
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:18:38
LOL. Someone needs a belly-rub.

You rotten stinking liar.

Congratulations, you are an idiot.
...but most of us are idiots, so that is no crime. Let's hope you learn from your mistakes \(I wish I did\).
Pay no attention to these TA morons. By the way you don't lose if you don't sell. If you bought at \(say\) 15000 expecting it to go higher in years to come, then a fall in price is simply a buying opportunity. If the price is going from 15 to 90 then it doesn't matter if it drops to 5 in the meantime \(unless you are wise enough to buy some more\).
