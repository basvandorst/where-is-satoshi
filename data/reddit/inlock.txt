I'm not aggressive, I just support the prosecution of tax evaders.

I'm happy that it won't take over a week to confirm. Well, lesson learned.

What is the command you are running?
It should look like this:
    SET GPU_USE_SYNC_OBJECTS=1
    sgminer.exe -o stratum+tcp://pool.darkcoin.io:3333 -u username.worker -p password
Replace pool.darkcoin.io:3333 with the name of your URL of your pool.

That's naive. You hurt the entire economy, and the people depending on it. You're basically stealing from the government. A part of it is their money once you earn it. If you don't agree with this, you can become a politician and change the law. You live in a democratic country, use it to its full extent. But don't go around encouraging young opportunists to break the law and steal from the country.
If you want a more specialised example of how tax evading hurts people, here's one. Let's say I'm a student (and students get public grants in the Netherlands). If people decide to evade taxes, I can't go to school anymore. You hurt me.

Yeah, that's basically how laws work. All laws. Better throw them all out, right?

I am indeed a socialist. But I forgot I'm arguing with Americans, because "socialist" is a pejorative term there.

What does socialism have to do with violence? Do you even know what socialism is?
Also, tax evasion is hardly a thing without consequences for other people. Tax evasion hurts the entire economy, and highers the debt of a country.
I cannot believe people are seriously advocating for tax evasion here.

I'm not sure if you're a troll, or just really delusional. Taxation is there for a reason, to keep a country running.
@_date: 2014-08-30 09:45:06
And you're the special little snowflake that is allowed to evade taxes. Seriously, you deserve to be prosecuted.

The error message is: An outpoint is already spent.
Yeah I guess I'll just have to wait.

What is the doc you are talking about?
