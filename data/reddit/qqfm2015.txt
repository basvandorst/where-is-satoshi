"Market buy" or market order is just a buying option on Gemini - this should explain it:

That idea is actually gaining a lot of steam recently, who knows how far it will go:
I can understand that feeling. I had friends in college who tried to sell me on bitcoin in April 2013. Once I get that time machine working I'll let you know :)

I absolutely should have - I thought the sky was falling.

I can relate - bought at $4900 when that was an ATH. It dropped the $3300 within a week and like an idiot, I sold and flipped it to ETH, which has had a few blips but overall been stagnant. I just dollar cost average now. Every friday, I put $200 into gemini and just do a market buy. 
There's smarter people than me who can time swings, but on a long enough time scale, bitcoin will continue to go up and up. 
I look at is as in investment that I believe in. I believe bitcoin is the future and will continue to go up in value. It may lose 10% today, 50% next week, but long term I know it will go through the roof. 
Think of it like buying a good company, like a Johnson and Johnson. If the price drops from $140 to $70 per share overnight, it doesn't change the fact that's its a great and valuable company. If anything, I'd just buy more shares at $70!
Dollar cost averaging lowers your risk exposure as well. Happy hunting! I'd also recommend Gemini over coinbase for lower fees.
