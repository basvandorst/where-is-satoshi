Good stuff, thank you.

Read-only as  data can be read but not modified. 
So, if it can will the BTC value update within the Electrum program even though its read-only?

No, i'm pretty sure its me with the misunderstanding.

I felt that my question was very direct and to the point. Perhaps I am missing missing something. Will need to do more research. 
btw, I have no idea what satoshis are, but thank you haha

Thank you!

Ok, please correct me if I am wrong.
So as long as the private key can be read, transactions can occur and this is the only requirement. So the answer is yes as long as the private key can be accessed???

 another entity
@_date: 2019-11-21 12:48:00
Ok, think I understand now.

None currently. Trying to do my research first. The OS i will be using is Tails so Electrum would be the easiest but I am also looking into wasabi for it better security. 
So the idea is that the change never get spent, just goes to an address never used? Or does this new address link back to your BTC balance?

I've neglected to clarify this, sorry.  Read-only as in MY keys, not the other party
@_date: 2019-11-21 18:08:16
This is what i was looking for. I keep hearing about wasabi. Have you used it? Is the minimum balance still 0.1BTC ($755)?
@_date: 2019-11-21 18:03:19
I keep hearing this mentioned, seems the easiest. My only concern is cameras at the store. Purchase logs + facial recognition technology could lead to deanonymization I would think. Not sure if this is put to use though.

Interesting Wiki, will need to do some reading. Thanks.

So the wallet file just contains the keys, not the BTC??
