It depends on your definitions of "we" and "replace," but for example why would companies pay truck drivers a salary if they can buy trucks that drive themselves for much cheaper? We're probably 10 years away from that being widespread, and 20 years from no human truck drivers (one of the very most common professions) in industrialized countries.

It was clear to me that Barry would have liked us to attend the meeting
regardless of any intention to sign the agreement.
It is possible I did not convey that clearly to a half dozen other Core
developers in passing on the invitation although I tried to.


a) I did not feel the other participants in the meeting would have
appreciated us being there if our intention was not to "compromise"
b) I did not feel it was Core's place to represent the opposition to the
intended agreement or negotiate on behalf of the opposition. (i.e. ever
attend a meeting like this)

A meta-legitimate criticism: mods do not allow legitimate criticism of the mods.
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:25:06


I agree that consensus is important. I remember fondly, long before you were a mod here or even an account, when it was possible to come here and openly make a case for or against a particular BIP, and have consensus actually worked out right here in the comments on proposal posts. I remember when it was possible to be critical of a moderator here and not worry about having your comments deleted or being banned outright. I remember when you could raise questions about potential conflicts of interest with the companies funding much of Core development and not wonder if the same pursestrings would be paying to erase those questions here.
A few weeks ago, I wrote the following comment on a post here about [uniting the Bitcoin community]( 


I stand by that statement. If opposing voices in a discussion are disallowed (or are only sporadically allowed), no actual consensus is possible. As an example, Iran has a democratically elected government, but the ayatollahs get to choose who gets on the ballot, so it's not particularly surprising when their candidates win!
My seemingly innocuous comment was silently removed (maybe by you!). I have no idea if this comment I'm writing will survive (doubtful!), but the thoughts expressed here are among the reasons why r/btc exists. On-topic freedom of speech does not exist in the largest subreddit about Bitcoin, the major anti-c_e_n_s_or_ship currency, and it's something I've been sad about every day for 2+ years. r/btc has a lot of problems, including its own conflicts of interest among its moderators, an awkward dual focus on Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash, and lots and lots of anger issues directed thisaway, but at least its mods mostly let ideas live and die on their own merits. I miss that here, and I hope it can return.

The real fallacy, of course, is to say that those "many different times" matter when this subreddit is three times larger than it was when the moderatorial activism began in earnest. There are hundreds of thousands of subscribers here who may not even have a solid understanding of what the big-block argument is (or that it exists), fallacious or no. To say that the debate is over is to say these new subscribers are incapable of choosing the better argument when presented with two. If that's not a belief held by the moderators, than it's an acknowledgment that open dialogue on the subject runs the risk of putting the house at a disadvantage.

It may be false, but it's not a blatant lie. I'm trying to look at this objectively.
Per [Github's contributor page]( 62 devs have contributed code to bitcoin core in the last two years.
The top 20 on that chart are responsible for 2964 out of 3404 commits, or 87.1%. Of those top 20, I count 11 who are Blockstream or Chaincode employees: sipa, TheBlueMatt, jnewbery, morcos, sdaftuar, luke-jr, ryanofsky, gmaxwell, jtimon, pstratem, instagibbs.
Those 11 are credited with 1576 of the commits in the past two years or well over half of the commits from the top 20. 46.3% of bitcoin code changes overall, by people employed by just two companies.
I'm not at all happy with the current state of the development team working on btc1, but this subreddit has chosen to be willfully blind about the influence of Chaincode and Blockstream and their small-block-requiring business model on the Core codebase.
@_date: 2017-10-23 19:54:03
The slippery-slope argument is dumb. Bitcoin needs larger blocks now, and Core has dragged their feet for three years, probably because they are mostly employed by companies that need blocks to be small forever to make any money. The corporate takeover happened a long time ago. I don't actually care if other companies assist in unblockstreaming Bitcoin; if their financial interests are wrapped up in making Bitcoin useable again, great, because that's where my financial interests are too.

1. To the extent they can be determined (based on the words and actions of their employees), the business models of Chaincode Labs and Blockstream depend on small blocks forever.
2. Blockstream has issued timelocked bitcoin transactions to employees as deferred compensation incentives for years and may well have crafted them in a way that would break with a hard fork, with no way to retrieve the coins.

The argument for lower income taxes is basically that: high taxes are a disincentive to work to improve your income. Probably true for very high rates, probably less true otherwise. But it is an argument that is made.
It's a fair point about savings disclosure being invasive, although I'd argue that it's not much more invasive than income disclosure, which we're just used to.
Whether or not it's politically feasible, there is nothing saying you can't tax consumption at more than 100% at the top tiers. If you're concerned about taxing the ultrarich for whom even 500% or whatever consumption tax wouldn't make a dent, you could certainly have an income tax kick in at some absurd income level.

"mBTC" is probably too technonerdy (and too many syllables) to catch hold of the popular imagination.  I think eventually people will call them "millies" (and µBTC will probably be "mikes"), but right now that sounds like something a science fiction author would use to refer to them in a future scenario where they are firmly established as the currency of record.
I like "mbits", but that might be too close to data transmission rates. It would be great to standardize on a name for them that's not too technical and not too informal, though. What else have you heard people use?

They may well go up to $100 in a few weeks. It's also quite possible that they'll go down to $45, or lower. (That uncertainty is why they're not already trading at $100).
Once upon a time, bitcoin was trading at $30. A few weeks later, it was trading at $14. A few weeks after that, it was trading at $3. Hopefully there's a lesson in there about not investing money you can't afford to lose most of.
