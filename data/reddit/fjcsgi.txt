I have never heard of electrum breaking before and you can misuse any wallet if you try hard enough to do so.

Your story comes a little short here. Have you told them that you've put your life savings into Bitcoin? Why do they think that?
@_date: 2014-06-28 20:18:34
I bet it'll come soon since they've got the charts and all up.

Barry tried to buy a bunch of Bitcoins from an auction, but someone outbid him.

Meanwhile the trading volume is ridiculously low. :(

I didn't even read  these comments. I'm just testing this.

Sounds like a security risk to me. Also pretty unlikely to happen anytime soon imo.

Just bought it. First bitcoin purchase in six months, worked really smoothly.
The two single tracks sound awesome.
@_date: 2014-09-08 18:59:27
This is why I'm divesting from bitcoin.

So to receive the tip you have to enter your reddit login details?

Surely we'll soon plummet to the two hundreds in price with the ETF gaining legitimacy and ebay talking bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-05-22 21:35:21


For real? That's like way soon. I'm getting excited here.
@_date: 2014-06-28 20:33:30
Yeah there was a 12-hour window to send your bids in. Winners will get notified on monday.
@_date: 2014-09-02 19:55:37
Not that one.

Someone sold a few thousand coins at once so it went through all the sell orders to 102 dollars. So the actual price on the market was 102 for a second there.
@_date: 2014-05-21 22:25:03
I guess he means that it's not really a donation per se, since you're buying stuff. 
@_date: 2014-06-28 20:30:13
Android's google search shows the price. Weird that it doesn't show up on the website.
@_date: 2014-02-24 20:13:40
Mine came through in like 15 minutes with 1 confirmation.
@_date: 2014-06-10 15:37:33
I wish google did this soon.
@_date: 2014-01-22 09:24:30
The public will not be switching over to Linux computers, two factor-authentications and cold storages. If Bitcoin really hits through and the common folk start using it, it'll be through an easy to use web platform, much like a normal bank without having to worry about those fowl swoops by yourself.
@_date: 2014-06-25 23:25:38
@_date: 2014-02-27 07:47:03
Be sure to buy at $12000.

Yes. A month ago.

@_date: 2014-06-05 19:23:42
Yeah. x/y, where x = Money you've spent on bitcoin and y = Number of bitcoins you own
@_date: 2014-02-13 17:57:30
Yeah but this is 50% more incredible than $900's.
