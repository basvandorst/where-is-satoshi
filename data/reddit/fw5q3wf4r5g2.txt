Broadcasting onto the chain closes the channel, as it immediately settles funds to all the parties involved. Opening a new channel requires sending new funds to a multi-sig address, which requires a new on-chain transaction.
If you tried to settle a channel after every individual transaction, you're in fact, doing more than double the number of bytes on-chain than a standard bitcoin transaction, because you require one transaction to open and one transaction to close the channel (and these transactions are slightly bigger than single address transactions because multi-sig transactions use more bytes). It will end up costing you much more. The idea is that payment channels are/should be opened for continuous use with a deadline upon which they're automatically closed.
One way to think about them is like pre-paid service cards, where you load up funds onto them (opening the channel), then can use the card freely within a time frame while funds are still on them, and after the time limit, the remaining funds are returned to your bank account. (Note that this will be very different to "gift cards" that many businesses use at present, where they get the remaining funds on the card which you don't spend after they expire - giving them free money. Think how many gift cards get lost/forgotten about and never used.)

Yet the "expert economists" with decades of experience of reading charts and technical analysis have been proven wrong time and time again. Every time in fact, they have deduced that Bitcoin is a bubble about to burst, it does a 180 on them and completely shits on their predictions.
It's not just "that one time that bitcoin dropped from 5k to 3k", it's happened  dozens of times over the past 8 years, with the same result each time. Price drops a little, people panic sell, and the price goes back up.
It's the people panic selling who lose out, because they probably paid more for the coin than the current market price and they're worried they "might lose even more money than they've already lost".

Also bear in mind that if you place a stop limit order with stop at 14000 and limit at 14000, it is not guaranteed to sell. If you have a buyer at 14005 and the next highest buyer is at 13995, then the stop won't trigger until the first buyer has bought, and it won't sell for the second buyer because he's not above your limit. For that reason you should always set a limit below the stop price.

I first tried it in the World Beer Mueseum at Tokyo Sky City. Wasn't sure what to expect, was thinking it might have an overpowering Miso taste, or so subtle it'd just be a gimmick. Turned out it had the perfect balance, where it's a very distinct miso taste without being overpowering on the beer. I drank it a few seconds and immediately ordered another. The motherfuckers didn't have any more, that was their last bottle in stock. I tried a couple of other beers then left.
I then spent a few hours searching around Tokyo for a store that sold these things. Eventually found a small shop that has them regularly. I keep going back.

Bitcoin has a limit on the number of transactions that can be processed at once in order to prevent transaction spam which could DDoS the network. That creates a marketplace for transactions where people who are willing to pay more to get their transactions processed are prioritized by the miners.
BCash forked from Bitcoin with a temporary solution to this problem which increases the block size by 8 times (with the possibility of growing further). However, it hasn't solved the bigger scaling problem that will be needed if Bitcoin is to become mainstream. And by increasing the block size further, it limits the number of people who can run full nodes and contribute to verifying that network users are well-behaved, making BCash more centralized.

Japan can be cheap. The most expensive part is the flight, but you can sometimes find bargains on them if there's multiple stops for example.
Food in Japan is really cheap. You don't need to go to expensive restaurants because some cheaper Izakaya are fantastic. The B-grade gourmet is high quality, and the chefs are usually really friendly. Drinks can be a bit expensive though, so watch out where you go (ie, don't eat out in Shibuya or Ginza every night). Also, if you go for last minute hotels on booking.com, you can usually get a cheap night in an APA hotel or whatnot. There's also cheap shuttle hotels if you don't mind roughing it and using shared bathrooms. I found a good host on AirBnB in Kyoto where I stayed for nearly a week for less than 30k yen. I also roughed it for a night when climbing Fuji. Buy a gaijin travel card before you go to Japan, will probably save you money (will definitely save you money if you travel between Tokyo and Kyoto/Osaka, as the Shinkansen is something like 10k Yen).
Also, tax free shops (8% saving) for gaijin if you plan on bringing any electronics or whatnot back home.

The better question is, what makes you think it won't go up? 
Hint: Don't look at the last 8 days, as that might only give you a clue as to where Bitcoin will be in another 8 days. Instead, look at the last 8 months and project how it might perform in the next 8 months.

When the network is busy you need to pay higher transaction fees to have priority. Miners will fill each block with the transactions which pay the most, so you're left in a queue until the network calms down. If you didn't pay high enough fee, the transaction will eventually be dropped from the network.
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:16:15
Arbitrage the exchanges
For example, GDAX usually trades higher than other exchanges, so buy on the cheaper ones, transfer directly to GDAX and sell higher. Make sure you pay decent fees to get your transactions done as quick as possible. Also take into account fees for withdrawing and depositing your fiat currency.
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:25:20
But at some point you need to transfer the dollars back from GDAX to Kraken, or you're sitting on useless USD which is losing value w.r.t Bitcoin. During that time it could swing out of your favor and you're not making anything.

The bubble will pop soon when the huge fraud being committed by a certain large bitcoin exchange can no longer be contained. Most likely this will result in a big price drop with some loss of confidence in cryptocurrency, but will be short lived as people realize that the shit was caused by centralized issuance of cryptocurrency, and that Bitcoin is actually the solution to the problem. Consequently, the price will skyrocket up to $50-100k by this time next year.
Only reason to sell now is so that you might be able to double your bitcoin volume by buying the dip. After that, just hodl and watch it grow.

No, BTC looks awesome long term, with the Lightning network implemented and round the corner. It's only short term that looks bleak.
It's BCH that has no long term future. Increasing the block size is only a temporary fix for a much bigger scaling problem. It might look appealing now while BTC transaction fees are high, but if it is going to take off (which I doubt), it will only face the same problems in a couple of years, and will need to use the lightning network anyway if it wants to continue scaling. But why would people bother with that when it'll already be running on the BTC network?
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:43:05
Yes, Coinbase has suspended withdrawal of BCash. They've also closed the BCH-EUR and BCH-BTC exchanges and don't plan to open them until January.
The reason being, they can't get enough buyers of BCash to make the exchange they've spend months building work. If they opened the exchanges now and let the markets decide, then BCash price would tank to nothing. They have vested interests and this scenario isn't desirable for them.

The FUD is a concerted effort by actors with a stake in BCH to convince people to dump BTC and buy their shitcoins. They do it every time there's a difficulty adjustment which makes it appear like Bitcoin is beyond saving and that they have a viable long term solution to this problem (They don't, their solution is only short term).
It's more profitable for them to mine BCH when BTC is more difficult to mine, so they push the price up to maximize the gains they can have from mining it. However, as soon as there's another difficulty adjustment, the majority of miners will jump back to mining BTC.

It's still in alpha stage. It's got growing pains, and development takes time, and can not necessarily keep up with the massively growing demand of people wanting to get in on it.
BTC serves to purpose of allowing two remote parties to trade in a desirable currency without relying on a third party to mediate their funds. It serves the purpose of letting you be in control of your currency, without needing a bank to tell you when and where you can withdraw your own money, or allowing your government to seize half of it because your bank's directors have a gambling addiction.

That's not bad for 35 days. I assume you were traveling and didn't stay in one place for more than a few days? Traveling is more expensive, because when you stay in one place you pay less for hotels for multiple nights. If you're traveling as a couple, it's not going to double the cost of your accommodation.
If you're going to stay in one place for a while, renting an apartment on airbnb will be much cheaper than hotels, and you'll have the facilities to cook your own food. If you shop at a proper food market, they're much cheaper than paying conbini prices for pre-made foods. You can eat freshly cooked food and get a pint at an Izakaya for the same cost as getting a bento + can of beer from a conbini.

No, because the price on GDAX may drop more than $500 before you can transfer the BTC between the exchanges. It's risky, but can pay off if you're lucky.
On the other hand, consider that most of the selling on GDAX could be done by Coinbase themselves. They simply sell to you a bitcoin for $16,000  then immediately buy up 1 BTC at $15,500 from Kraken, making $500 for every BTC traded. The reason BTC transactions on Coinbase are taking so long is they've gotta wait for them to come from Kraken first.

If you read my post again I'm not arguing that recent growth is adoption. I'm arguing that the publicity created by recent growth has brought in new adopters, even if they might be a small fraction of the people who bought bitcoins during that period. It means we have more adopters than we had before, which is good for the long term growth of the network. The larger fraction who bought for FOMO and probably sold already won't make a difference in the long term, they're not adopters, I agree.

The limit in a stop loss is the minimum price it will sell at. It'll always sell at market rate if the price is above your limit and the stop is triggered.
GDAX is particularly bad because you usually can't buy into the dip after a stop loss because everything is slow or your orders just get rejected, if the page even loads.
But given that Bitcoin price can swing by several k $ in the space of minutes if someone executes a large market sell for example, then I'd suggest not using them as you'll be selling your bitcoins even though the market isn't really crashing.
Might be better to set up some kind of alert so that when a price is hit you get a notification on your phone, then you can manually decide whether to sell or hodl.

Yes. The lightning network allows people to conduct multiple transactions over a period of time, whilst only using a pair of transactions on the blockchain per channel. One transaction opens a channel where two people can trade bidirectionally on the bitcoins initially put into the channel. The channel can stay open until one party decides to close it (or after a pre-arranged time), at which point the fees are transferred between bitcoin wallets. There are no other required fees for transfers between parties who already have a channel open. The main drawback of the network is you have to initially put some funds in to open a channel, and those funds will be tied up for the duration the channel is open. 
The software is already implemented and you can try it out now by running your own node. There's 3 implementations to pick from depending on which programming language you want to work with (if developing/bug reporting). Not really sure when it'll be consumer ready. Also after release, there's still infrastructure that'll need implementing, such as website front-ends, which will make it simpler to use for most people.
The LN is implemented as additional software which runs alongside the Bitcoin network. It uses the bitcoin network to open and close trading channels, and uses Bitcoins as the source of funds for each channel. All other transactions on a channel happen off-network - not on any specific public ledger, but as communications between the two parties who have a channel open.

Firstly, let's separate Bitcoin from the term Cryptocurrency, since the latter, more general term, usually means fake copies of the original which don't provide an intrinsic value over the original.
So lets say you did sell at $19,000 BTC and then you buy back in at $20,000 BTC. You've actually lost 0.05 BTC by simply holding your asset in the wrong currency at the wrong time.
Bitcoin can swing either way in the blink of an eye. You might try your best to predict what it'll do in the short term, but it's like flipping a coin. You'll win and lose some, and it'll probably even out to not actually making anything.
On the other hand, if you had $19,000 in 2011 and you left it in your bank, it's probably worth something like $21,000 today due to interest (Although it's actual value is still the same as when you put it in your bank, due to inflation).
On the other hand, if you put that $19,000 into Bitcoin in 2011, when it was at an ATH at the time (say, $30/BTC), you'd have gained 633 bitcoins at the time.
You'd still have 633 bitcoins today.
Not bad for doing basically nothing.

Actually, it shows that the fixed block size is doing exactly the job it's intended to do: filter out the junk from the real transactions people want (and are willing to pay) to do.
If the limit wasn't in place, it would mean every user's hard disk would be getting filled up with useless transactions that they're expected to keep stored forever. You can see that this won't scale.
Of course, ever growing transaction fees are not a solution either, but the solution is being worked on. We can scale most transactions off chain and leave the block chain for the important transactions that people are willing to pay fees for.
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:36:44
The problem with trying to be smart with bitcoin is that your 1 bitcoin is only worth 0.8 bitcoin tomorrow if you lock away your money in that shitty asset called USD. (Which you failed to point out, loses value as you hold it).
So you might sell your 1 BTC at $19,000 and be happy as you try and predict the next direction it'll take. Next time you look it's at $20,000 and you've lost out, because by the time your bank has wired your money back to a bitcoin exchange it's at $21,000.
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:39:31
Indeed. It's the people who bought above the current market rate who are panicking to sell (anyone who bought in much earlier is still massively in profit). This means those panicking are about to lose money by selling below what they bought at, usually newcomers who haven't seen this happen dozens of times like the rest of us. We're just dropping a friendly reminder that they won't lose out if they hold on to it for a short while, even though it looks like they might be losing money in the short term.
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:31:14
Thanks. It's people who place all these low stop loss orders that will allow me to buy discounted bitcoins if the price does fall.
Remember it's not just your own stop loss orders. Lets say if tomorrow the price were to "correct" itself to $10k. The problem is that people have stop loss orders placed at 11k, 10k, 9k, 8k and 6k. A sudden dip would cause a cascading effect, triggering these stops one after another where everyone below the 10k mark is selling below what would be the market rate.
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:49:07
Growth depends on adoption rate. Over the past couple of months we've seen massive new adoption due to media frenzy and Bitcoin being placed in front of everyone who wasn't previously aware of it. This isn't natural adoption and is mostly people FOMO, which can explain the sudden rise and the correction shortly after as people get scared they've invested in something they don't understand and afraid of losing money.
Long term, steady growth is all that matters. If more people are using Bitcoin than were using Bitcoin 2 months ago, it doesn't matter if there was a big peak and a sudden dive afterwards, because more people have adopted Bitcoin and the long term efforts are paying off. The price of Bitcoin won't drop below what it was a few months ago because of all the new users.
If you're a gambler, you can look at these peaks and dives as a way to make a quick bit of money. Don't let those gambles distract you from long term investment though. Bitcoin is still well ahead above where it was last month, and next month it'll be ahead of where it is this month. Don't get down because you missed the peaks and dips, you can't predict them, you can only look at them retrospectively and wish you'd done something different at the time.

You need to get people to use the lightning network first. If you keep extending the blocksize and allowing low transaction fees on-blockchain, there's no incentive to start using the LN and doing transactions off-chain. This will only continue to delay the adoption of the LN.
First step is to make everyone use the LN to get low fees (among other advantages), then think about scaling the blockchain to fit the needs of a growing LN.

It's not integrated into the bank's financial system, it exists completely separate to that. They've tried to pin a non-bitcoin asset on the price of Bitcoin so they can gamble on its success without having to own any of it.
It's difficult to use as a currency while we have growing pains now, but the eventual effort will pay off when we have an off-chain network of transactions which can't be publicly tracked like the blockchain can, which will liberate us even more from bankers as we'll be able to trade with who we want, when we want without them interfering and trying to steal a percentage of our money at every point.
The other "solutions" to the current fee problem actually help bankers, by keeping everything visible on the blockchain where they can view it. Is it really necessary to keep a distributed public ledger of every cup of coffee you buy, every train you ride, for eternity? Of course it's not. Keeping everything on the blockchain is a shitty idea that needs to be thrown away. We should only need to use the blockchain to assert control of our assets when there might be a dispute about who they belong to.

They tried the flippening again, this time they even got Coinbase on board. It failed (again), and we're just seeing the immediate aftermath of the failure now. Bitcoin is going to shoot back up again like it did last time they tried the flippening.
Currently the price of BCH (and ETH and LTC) is being pegged to the price of BTC at GDAX, via people arbitraging the currencies using their API. This will soon change, when BCH gets up again people will want to dump what they didn't get chance to dump yet.
Coinbase will probably kill the exchange again when that happens, because volatility in their favor = good, volatility not in their favor = bad. They've shown their true colors during the past few days. Anyone with a long term interest in Bitcoin should get out and find a more honest exchange (if such thing exists)

This visualization is also shit at trying to demonstrate the amount of (de)centralization. You have a bunch of "outer nodes" with only a single channel open, then a bunch of "inner nodes" with more than one channel open.
To make the network "more decentralized", you need the outer nodes to open channels directly with other outer nodes rather than going through the inner nodes which already have multiple channels open.
What happens then is that those 2 outer nodes that previously had only one open channel, now have multiple open channels and become inner nodes.
So while you're displaying inner vs outer nodes in this way, it will always appear to be "centralized", because you're visually centralizing the activity of the network. Opponents of LN are trying to use this view to ["prove" that LN is centralized](
Try randomly placing nodes and connecting the dots, and see how centralized that looks.

It's silly because someone could place a huge market sell and drop the price by a big amount instantly if there's not much liquidity in the market, but this short term fluctuation gives no indication of the real market value. When this happens, a bunch of stop loss orders are triggered, discounting the price further, and it has a cascading effect of triggering more stop losses at lower prices.
See for example the what happened to ETH on gdax a few months back. [The price fell to $.10]( and climbed back up right away. People lost money and complained to gdax because they thought it was a bug, but the stop losses were functioning exactly as intended. The same thing has happened with Bitcoin several times but not to such extent because there's more liquidity on the Bitcoin markets.
Of course I don't mean to say stop losses are useless. For day traders they're a useful tool and those users know what they're doing. For the regular user they're a silly way to lose money.
