Correct, it would only increase usability for those making Starbucks transactions. Not sure there's anything wrong with that. Lightening network only increases usability for those who have a payment channel open with the individual they want to transact with. The Starbucks deal give users more access to quick transactions than that since anyone using Starbucks would take advantage of it at no cost to them.  
  
The deal would be an "inside deal" not known to the public. This way there would be no intentionally low/no fee transactions, because no one is aware of the deal.  
  
Obviously I can't speak for the parties making the deal on what they want, cause that'll be on an individual basis, but I don't think it would cost Starbucks that much. If fees are consistent due to lack of deal knowledge to the customer, the free coffee given to the pool ops would just be icing on the cake. The competition doesn't come from competing with others for block space, but with other coffee companies competing for priority.

I'm not an accountant, but everything I google (as well as two accountants I've spoken with) disagree. Capital gains count towards your AGI.

They don't have backend developers working on ID veriftication. They have backend devs scaling their database and trading platforms, which is another huge issue.
And come on now. Why not just be honest and say you want Coinbase to support segwit so Bitcoin Cash loses traction.

You guys need to understand that fees were never the only determining factor in confirmation time. Coin age and number of inputs also played a role. Overtime, miners started ignoring these other rules to favor transactions with higher fees.
Of course, those rules don't help for a world-wide payment system. People will spend little bits of newly received bitcoins due to the chaos of making many, many purchases. Meaning, higher fees for daily users.
However, the rules encouraged saving and consolidation of your bitcoins. Holding your bitcoin in a single address would cost less to spend than sending the same amount from multiple addresses (smaller data size per transaction). And sending older bitcoins would take priority over newer received coins.
One can argue, that if miner's stuck to the old rules, it would encourage saving/consolidation which in itself would lower transaction fees. Not only because of following the rules, but because of the decreased transaction volume due to following the rules.
However, following the old rules isn't conducive to a world-wide payment network for daily transactions.
Which, IMO, based on these old rules as well as other, Bitcoin was never meant to be.
My main argument for this post though, is that we don't know which rules the pool chose to confirm these two separate transactions. OP gave no information.
Did the 70sat/B transaction have less inputs and more age than the 1000sat/B? Was the pool practicing altruism in including the transaction? Was there an outside deal done with the pool and sender? ie, confirm my transactions quickly in exchange for free food at my bakery. Was the block already 99% full and the 70sat/B transaction topped off the remaining amount?
Point being, we don't know the reasons or rules followed. So this is a bit of a loaded post OP made.

I was talking about gains that already acquired long term status. But, yea. I do agree it would make the most sense if you're in the 0% gain bracket. Otherwise you have around $400,000 you can sell before you're out of the 15% gain bracket.  
  
However, your gains do count towards you AGI and will push you into a higher income tax bracket. Which can affect other things. Such as personal exemptions, itemized deductions, certain tax credits, IRA accounts, and insurance premiums.  
  
That's my understanding at least. Correct me if I'm wrong.

So you wanna spam support with you political agenda so Coinbase can't help their customers with real issues? Pathetic.

Factually, Segwit has nothing to do with a majority of user issues. The majority are about ID verification and locked accounts and database scalling/backend platform issues.

I find it odd that they rebranded and we didn't hear about it. They were one of the most funded, if not the most funded, Bitcoin company a couple years ago and it made headlines for days. The email idea doesn't seem as revolutionary as what was once touted.

If Coinbase keeps restricting people's account from selling, Bitcoin will definitely reach over $20k, but you won't be able to sell any of it...  
  
This isn't looking unlike what happened to mtgox in 2013... Limit the supply by limiting the amount of sellers, sell your customers the btc you have on hand for the inflated rate, then open sales up to customers all at once, driving prices wayyy down in a flash crash, during this time Coinbase starts buying up all the BTC with the money they made from the limited sale price increase...  
  
I have no proof this is going on with Coinbase, but it's awfully odd that my account is restricted when it was perfectly fine a week or two ago and verified as high as possible since 2014.
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:22:43
To add... it's not just about taking profits. Some people will take a loss if they have gains elsewhere to offset or bump themselves down a tax bracket.
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:44:04
I understand, and maybe it's very short-sighted for me to say the only reasons Bitcoin wants Coinbase to implement Segwit is to make sure Bitcoin Cash doesn't gain traction. The sooner Segwit starts, the sooner users will see it's affects. I actually criticized Bitcoin Cash for removing Segwit when they forked. However, the big picture might be that by pressuring Coinbase to implement Segwit, you're modeling the exact behavior that we wanted to eliminate.  
  
There were people who pleaded and begged banks to stop the bullshit years ago. We know this because Bitcoin came from the people who the banks wouldn't listen to. And now this same behavior is being modeled and repeated with Coinbase. I think the big picture may be that Coinbase doesn't have any competition. So they are free to do whatever they want. Segwit won't solve their support or scaling issues. Which are the biggest issues they face as a company today. And if Bitcoin gets used less because of high network transaction fees, they could simply make their profits by implementing other coins.  
  
I think, as a community, it may be better to push for other exchanges to start business and grow their business to something that can compete with Coinbase. (boycotting is a bit passive-aggressive and counter-productive) I haven't seen any exchange even attempt to go through what Coinbase has, as far as security, features, licensing, etc for the USA. So I'm unsure if the reason is no one wants to go through the hassle Coinbase went through, or if they want to but don't see how to get funded.  
  
Maybe the solution is decentralized exchanges, or maybe in the future it will be easier for exchanges to start business in the USA. Unfortunately, right now, there is no answer to the big problem in sight.

If you have a lot of gains, it might makes sense to slowly sell each year to avoid a higher tax bracket.

Are you basing this off of the public key starting with 3? Because that can be a single key segwit address too.

I think you're applying intentions that aren't there. I never said I wanted to be in a relationship with her again. She also doesn't want marriage and kids with anyone, not just me. Which is evidence by her past and current relationships.

Just research a lot and invest in fields you know about and can relate to. I was a HEAVY computer/tech researcher back when I first heard of bitcoin. All the stuff happening with Snowden, government spying, etc, and my understanding of technology and protocols put cryptocurrency and myself at the right place at the right time... My best advise for you doesn't involve crypto-currency though. My advise is always look for opportunities, then research and know exactly what you're getting into and do the best you can at them. There are tons of great small business ideas that are never going away. Also keep your bills as low as possible and save money so you can capitalize on an idea when you see one.
@_date: 2018-05-12 00:44:06
It's hard to say that I'm over her. I still have a desire to see her and talk to her about everything that happened since and how my life changed because of her. But ultimately I know that if she doesn't want marriage and kids, I'm gonna get my heart broken again. I'm curious about what happened in her childhood to make her not want those things as well as what caused her drug use, but I can't change any of her decisions. And I know she won't lie to me about our compatibility for money.  
  
About autism, I'm not positive I have it. That's a whole other topic to think about. But, if I meet someone, I follow Stefan's advice and try not to think with my dick until those questions are answered.

I dunno about elsewhere, but capital gains laws in the USA makes it make little sense to cash out all at once. You would owe a gigantic sum in taxes if you had millions and did. Depending on if you believed in Bitcoin or Ethereum or whatever and still wanted to buy back in, you have to now hope prices increase so much in the future to recoupe what you lost in taxes for cashing out and/or hope prices drop so much when bubble burst that you can buy back the difference. Way more safe to sell a little and hodl the rest imo.

See, I disagree. I think your story is a very good reason to tell people how much money you've made. It's helped ween out some people from your life who aren't your friends, but instead seek to take advantage of someone else's good choices.  
  
Now, I'm not saying to tell every Tom, Dick, and Harry... I think who you tell depends on the level of relationship you want with that person too. I don't tell people unless I need to verify their character before I move the relationship to the next level. Think of it like a shit test.  
  
What's important is always being strong enough to defend yourself against crappy people. Otherwise you open yourself up to abusive relationships. The OP did this perfectly.. So I think everything here that happened was good and healthy.

I got so much hate a while back for predicting price drops and laying out my reasons and evidence for it to happen. I thought long and hard before posting too. I could've not told anyone and capitalized on my information, or I could've told everyone to help stop them from losing money. I chose helping them. Posted a couple things on Reddit... And got vilified for it because everyone wanted to pump the prices. Never had I ever received so much hate. Way more than when I called out MaidSafe as a never-ending money grab machine...  
  
After my predictions came true, I made another post letting people know that and gave my next predictions. Most people downvoted it and said what happened was a coincidence and I got lucky... even though I predicted the price within $10...  
  
My next prediction in that post came true too, but I said "F*** it" and didn't tell anyone or bother to prepare another prediction for the public.  
  
If I do so, in the future, it will go on my youtube channel. Where most people are more logical and analytical of my thoughts. Instead of bashing me for no reason. In fact, I've stayed away from sharing on reddit for a while now.

Technically Bitcoin is the network and bitcoins are the asset on the network. There was a giant push for this for many years to embed this in people's minds.
