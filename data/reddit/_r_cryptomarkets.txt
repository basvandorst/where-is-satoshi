Why would mods delete my posts if i'm accessing Reddit via Tor?  Just curious.
@_date: 2013-11-25 09:52:08
Well someone has to give you something for spending you're time and effort to make this.

Yes i'm sure the whatever encrypted data is uploaded to the cloud gets set aside by the NSA to crack.  The thing is, it's going to take them millions of years if you use good encryption.

I never thought of it that way.

Seems like a good deal for the subscribers but i don't know if the mods are incentivized to do something like this.  needs competition.  It would be nice if there was another Reddit community related to cryptography which had almost 70,000 subscribers.

I don't believe CNBC is very influential anymore. They have 37,000 average viewers and declining in step with their ratings. This is probably because a lot of Americans are broke so they can't invest money and a plethora of alternative financial news sources propping up through the web. I think the general discussion of Bitcoin is happening regardless of what CNBC says. The internet is eliminating all the central gateways(CNBC, Bloomberg, etc) to accessing information. People no longer need to be near the central hubs of activity in order to catch word of mouth.

Mr Voorhees, i'm dissapointed about you're view on altcoins.  For what it's worth, here's an ALTcoin tip in thanks for Coinapult, Satoshi Dice, being a class act, and promoting the crypto economy in general.

Thanks for spending the time to make this video clip.  It would be nice if you could add a timeline and current price for each news segment.

Did you see Stefan debate Peter Joseph of the Venus Project?  Stefan was more assertive in that one.  I think you're right.  Stefan has an interest in Peter's show.

Accurate analogy.  I'll remember that one.  Group think is through the stratosphere on in this community.  Thx

Sounds like a good idea.  Maybe the moderators should add and auto generated weekly discussion thread for this topic and a different topic for the next day.  Maybe other topics could be about examples of Bitcoin paying off debt or transferring money internationally.  :)

This is quite a benchmark.  How many transactions per second can Bitcoin handle?
@_date: 2013-11-24 11:30:54
Probably only in would that happen in this case.  I'm not confident this would happen in or because they have less appreciation for digital signatures.

CNBC is just background noise to them.  The institutional money doesn't make decisions based on cable news outlets.  They do their homework and they see how valuable Bitcoin is.  I'd say its the other way around.  I think CNBC has a pulse on Wall Street in regards to Bitcoin and so they are just going with the flow.

I haven't tried it before but can't Reddit be accessed through Tor and make a throw away account?

I've been wondering all this time why there isn't a Bitcoin exchange in Dubai.  It seems like their is a vacuum in the middle east without a Bitcoin exchange.  They love their gold too but i think they can develop a taste for Bitcoin as well.  The monarch Sheikh Mohammed is trying to build everything over there so why not a Bitcoin exchange?
@_date: 2013-11-23 07:38:25
Three steps:
1. Buy BTC from Coinbase.
2. Transfer BTC to BTC-E.
3. Sell your BTC for USD.  
Problem solved.
Isn't this why BTC has value because it can be easily transferred to anywhere in the world which has access to the internet?

I'm guessing you must live somewhere in between Alberta and Saskatchewan if your thinking you can only use LocalBitcoins?  I thought Canada was suppose to be one of the most affluent countries in the world in regards to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-25 17:55:55
Yeah, with the potential for Bitcoin itself to grow, should grow with it.  I think there's going to be a correlations between the two.  Let's beat and We can reach several millions.

Just buy from APMEX if you want a combi bar.  I'm sure you won't pay such a high premium.

So this app is one step higher on the innovation ladder it seems.  Sound great. Thx for developing it.
@_date: 2013-11-24 10:39:16
Agreed.  Let's hope Al Gore doesn't claim he built the Bitcoin.

On your Purchase Info page it says:
*To order you must have a previous or create a new Paypal account, as we handle the payment through Paypal.*
I'm assuming you just haven't updated the page.  Have you contacted BitPay?
