This appears to be some support for the claim that the leaked documents from 2 days ago may have some legitimacy.

Even if divisibility were increased it's still not infinite.. that word has a real meaning and maybe you're just using it incorrectly.
Further, this is on the [hard fork list]( so no, you're both wrong.

That's silly. As it stands the specification is that values are 64 bit integers. That would be a breaking change to the protocol.
edit: Maybe I should have said "the current protocol specifications says.."

You pick the fee and the average fee will shift according to: current reward, current transaction volume, current hashing power, and current desire for transactions to get confirmed quickly. It's self adjusting.
Most basically, if fees are too low txns will take too long to confirm and people wanting faster transactions will choose to increase them.

They are not infinitely divisible and they are not floating point numbers. They're int64s of the smallest units. 
edit: To be more clear,  0.00000001 is the smallest possible unit so 0.000000000001 isn't possible and very likely won't be as increasing divisiblity (which is very much not infinite) is considered a "hard fork" change.

you may have talked about this before but what's the software stack? most have options of doing zero-downtime upgrades

I've looked briefly -- do you collect coverage metrics? what are you at?
For the wire protocol they have:
        $ go test -cover github.com/conformal/btcwire
        ok  	github.com/conformal/btcwire	0.078s	coverage: 100.0% of statements
Which is a good thing (potentially extreme even but for this sort of technology probably not crazy).

Sorry no. See here: [hard fork list](

I'm reminded of Schiff's breakable gold card.

I guess I thought it would be a rendering level problem not a data problem

did you consider using the [btcd]( implementation and supporting packages (btcwire, btcwallet, etc) from the folks at conformal?
Thoughts on it?
