Sometime in the next two weeks. That date is just the final deadline. They can't make their decision after that.

Not trying to sound rude, but this question has been asked hundreds of times. And you already know that because your searched and saw the answers. 
Don't just ask the same thing again, because you're just going to get the same answers again. Be more specific about what you want. What exactly didn't you understand from the other posts? What acronyms? What references?
@_date: 2017-02-16 05:55:27


Not necessarily. You could just transfer the coins after they receive it. Assuming they don't transfer it straight away.
@_date: 2017-03-14 06:40:56


That's not how Bitcoin works.

The same as bitorrent

He would still own coins on both chains. You can't move coins off one chain and in to the other.

Read as "played Kerbal space program"
Edit: this was meant as sort of a joke, but I can't find any spaceship building Sims from NASA. Anyone know what they might be referring to other than Kerbal space program?

Can we use something more reputable than bitbet?

Copy of a comment that I posted a couple days ago.


Social engineering 101
It's a bit conspiracy. But I wouldn't be surprised that there's people around that were just trying to feed in to this hatred with useless posts just to keep it going

Why are you so determined to bet some Bitcoin, even such an insignificant amount?
I'll take the bet for 20btc
@_date: 2017-08-02 02:20:34
Honest answer: nothing. Some random numbers sort of match up with something else.

To me it reads like it's sarcasm

Have they? How do you know the price wouldn't have been higher without the forks?
@_date: 2017-04-16 08:57:17


Not without some intermediate service(the same as what we have now)


How is bitcoin involved there? And what do you mean by "the DApp"? What DApp? "DApp" isn't a singular thing, it stands for decentralized application.

How is segwit a Dapp? How does segwit make the coins instantly interchangeable?

I'm a little confused about what part of it you want explained. You're question was very general. But if your familiar with all the technical aspects you may need to be more specific about which part of it you don't understand.
I don't mean that too sound snarky. But you've basically asked the exact same question that you've just said you've already read up on.

He didn't say it can't be removed at all. He said it "cannot be removed from the network any more than any other part of the consensus code. "

That would be a monumentally stupid thing to do. Save a couple of dollars on a billion dollar transaction with the added risk of the previous owner transferring the btc out later

I like Bitcoin, I've been involved with it for years, I still hold a decent amount. But they are right, it's a gamble. Not a particularly safe as an investment.
Just because you guessed the correct lottery numbers doesn't mean entering the lottery was a good investment.

Why not skip qr codes and use nfc?

Do you mean he transferred them to gox after you gave them to him and just left them there?

They're notoriously bad at what they do. Though having said that I actually haven't heard anything about them (good, bad or otherwise) for a while

This article is completely unrelated to bitcoin other than half a sentence saying ASICs are also used for bitcoin mining. The ASIC talked about in the article isn't a bitcoin mining one.
@_date: 2017-05-28 22:52:06
So not mining bitcoins because they'll never be worth anything is the most sane?

How do you suggest getting the btc in the first place without going through some third party?
@_date: 2017-05-18 21:38:38
Why did this get upvoted? It's just a headline with no content. And it's not related to bitcoin.
