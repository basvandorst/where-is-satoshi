No, there are hundreds of posts where someone complains about having sent bitcoin to the wrong address, or them having falled for a scam and wanting their btc back.

TL;DR: I'll just ignore all the negative aspects of bitcoin and pretend we're living in a very unlikely future.
Do you realize how fucking stupid that sounds? No wonder everyone hates the bitcoin community.

Please tell me why the customer would want to choose over the amount of risk when ordering something online. I can't think of any situation where the customer would want more risk instead of less risk.


What the hell are you talking about? No need to get so mad.

I'm the one here who gets it. You can own bitcoin without being a delusional about it. You denying all bitcoins shortcomings doesn't make the currency any better, adressing and fixing the problems does.
In 20 years BTC might have caught up with fiat. Then I might finally start using instead of holding.
@_date: 2014-08-16 07:36:04
Not really. The risk is already pretty small with standard CC services. I don't see why the average customer would go through the hassle of acquiring and spending bitcoin just to slightly decrease the risk.
@_date: 2014-08-15 20:42:19


Why would anyone want to do that?
@_date: 2014-08-15 19:11:37


What makes you think companies will never store customer data just because they use BTC?  Remember that these scams still happen with standard fiat payments. And I highly doubt bitcoin services would suddenly be able to solve what other companies still havent managed to do.


See you are making an unfair comparison. You are comparing BTC of the future with the fiat of today.  I'm 100% sure those issues could be solved with CCs as well.


But they will. And when that happpens, why would you use bitcoin instead of that?


The more data needed to make a transaction, the more difficult it becomes to acquire and abuse.

Some merchants may do that, but everyone won't. A discount of max 3% is such a small percentage I doubt it would create too much pressure for other companies.
@_date: 2014-08-16 07:26:57
Well, that's not a biased opinion at all.
Calling bitcoin more secure and faster for the customer is pretty much a lie.


"Guaranteed" who guarantees that? And since when has every single company accepted BTC, after all, you said it can't be declined.


Completely subjective as well. But it's safe to say that Paypal is more convenient when it comes to online shopping.


Yes, let's completely ignore the fact that bitcoin has dropped over 50% in value during the past year. I'm sure you saved a lot of money when you had to buy more btc just to be able to afford the same things again.


That's a pretty ironic statement to make, isn't it?
@_date: 2014-08-16 10:21:04
Alternatively they keep the price the same and pocket an extra 3%.  What you're saying would be true if we were talking about double digit savings. But max. 3% really won't affect anything.

Oh. For a second there I thought you weren't totally delusional. You can't compare bitcoin in year 2100 with fiat in 2014. That makes absolutely no fucking sense at all. Saying it "has the potential" and it "could be" doesn't make the current state of bitcoin any better at all. I don't give a fuck about what it could be if I want to use the technology now.
Also for fucks sake, stop comparing bitcoin with email, internet and cellphones. Those 3 solved a problem, bitcoin just slightly improves upon on already existing methods.

Whereas btc doesn't have the problem of data breaches, online fraud is pretty prevalent.  The consumer has to be really careful when downloading software to the PC/Phone he stores his btc on.  The fact that 2-step verification isn't obligatory on all major online BTC services also increases the risk of online fraud.
I'm fairly sure these kinds of scams are more frequent than data breaches like what happened with Target. So all in all, the risks are pretty similar to what CCs suffer from.


Isn't that actually an advantage though? That makes it safer for the consumer to use a CC online. The address info is not needed to make a CC transaction, by the way.
@_date: 2014-08-15 18:30:26


Credit cards and paypal are as convenient, if not even more convenient than bitcoin in the examples you mentioned.
@_date: 2014-08-15 18:33:05
It really isn't. Bitcoin is worse in pretty much every imaginable way compared to fiat for the consumer.
@_date: 2014-08-15 20:53:35
hahaha, holy fuck that's dumb.
@_date: 2014-08-15 18:41:48


Yeah, that's a pretty huge problem though. Why would anyone use bitcoin when they risk their money every single time they try to buy something. One misclick and you could lose everything. Look at the hundreds of posts on reddit where people complain about sending btc to the wrong adress. Now imagine giving btc to a tech-illiterate consumer. Yeah you guessed it, it would not work at all.


That's bad for businesses, not necessarily for consumers.
Also, bitcoin is way more volatile than fiat. So your hyperinflation argument is pretty fucking laughable. No smart person stores all of their money in btc. So the consumer has to convert USD-&gt;BTC every single time they want to spend bitcoin in order to evade bitcoins volatility. Not so convenient, is it?
