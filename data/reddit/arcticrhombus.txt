No. Bitcoin Cash has not solved this problem, for two reasons (that I see). 
First, 8 MB can be filled up extremely easily. With empty blocks like Bcash has, transactions are essentially free.  When transactions are free the cost to spam the block chain is tiny. 8 MB blocks can easily be filled up with spam, for minimal cost. You like "Moby Dick" or The Bible and have some crypto money - post the whole text daily in every block! Why not! Scarcity is only created through full blocks and fees. And once you go much larger than 8 MB you run into some fundamental computing difficulties with transmitting data around the world  that others can explain better than me. And you reduce the number of nodes who can afford to buy giant hard drives and use up all their internet bandwidth to store "Moby Dick" for all time. And the nodes are the decentralization.  That's how you trust that the block chain tells a history that a bunch of people around the world agree on rather than what Amazon or Google or Coinbase or Antpool says it is.
Second, Bitcoin Cash torpedoes the economic future of Bitcoin. Satoshi  designed a system where every having the block reward decreases with the idea that fees from increased use would replace the block reward. And it worked! If fees stay where they are today at approximately 4 BTC per block, even with no block reward, we can see that miners will keep mining, because 4 BTC  today is worth a lot more then 12.5 BTC last year, and people mined then. Bitcoin Cash has no future because with each halving, and no fees, mining becomes more and more useless. No mining means no security. 
Incorporating the halving every four years, assuming current fees:
Now -
BTC Block = 12 BTC reward + 4 BTC fees = 16 BTC
BCH block = 12 BCH reward + 0 BCH fees = 12 BCH
2020 - 
BTC Block = 6 BTC reward + 4 BTC fees = 10 BTC
BCH block = 6 BCH reward + 0 BCH fees = 6 BCH
2024 -
BTC Block = 3 BTC reward + 4 BTC fees = 7 BTC
BCH Block = 3 BCH reward + 0 BCH fees = 3 BCH
2028 -
BTC Block = 1.5 BTC reward + 4 BTC fees = 5.5 BTC 
BCH Block = 1.5 BCH reward + 0 BCH fees = 1.5 BCH
So, by 2028, Bitcoin would just need to more than double to keep mining as profitable as it is today.
Bcash would need to sextuple.  And the situation would only get worse as the BCH block reward would go to zero.
Today, a miner might mine Bcash at 1/10 of the price of Bitcoin if difficulty is also 1/10th, because  you get approximately the same amount of tokens. (16 BTC, 12 BCH).
But in  2028 you'd be getting almost 4 times as many BTC tokens.  If Bcash were still 1/10 of the price of Bitcoin, you'd never mine it the Bcash difficulty was still 1/10 of Bitcoin. You'd only mine it when the difficulty fell to 1/40 of Bitcoin. End of difficulty is only 1/40 of bitcoin, then only 2.5 percent of bitcoin miners would be needed to mount a majority attack on BCH.

So at what point will it be appropriate to develop the fee market? Why will next time be different than this time?
"OMG 64 MB blocks are full! Fees are over $20 a transaction. I sent 1 million Cardono for two cents and 5 million TRON for eight cents. Cardano and TRON are the future. Bitcoin is obsolete. We need to raise the block size!"

It's not wrong to post Moby Dick. Just pay the market price. As a node, my hard drive space and my bandwidth has value to me. I don't intend on using it to maintain anything that anyone wants to post on the internet, for all time, without economic constraints.
I don't know enough about your second point to respond effectively to it.
As to your point about 32 MB, I agree that there is nothing that suggests that 1 megabyte is somehow the perfect size.  But it's the size we have which Satoshi also implemented as a spam limit.  The problem is that  if the long-term benefits of creating a fee market are put aside for short term convenience, a precident will be set.  And that precedent will be tempted to be repeated over and over again. And the political will for creation of the fee market will never exist and the project will fail.

For reference: [Federal Rules of Appellate Procedure](
@_date: 2015-06-05 17:35:00
An appeal is only permitted to review for mistakes of law, not mistakes in fact-finding. While the facts in the trial court frequently have bearing upon the questions of law, an appeal is - above everything - NOT an invitation to relitigate the case. 
Questions of law include: Whether the prosecution impermissibly failed to turn over exculpatory evidence; whether defense counsel was constitutionally ineffective (i.e. drunk, asleep, or moronic); whether Ross's lawyer had a fair opportunity to question jurors; whether the jury was systematically culled of people of Ross's race or gender by the prosecutor; whether Ross was denied the right to testify; whether Ross was seen in shackles by the jury and whether that would have denied him the presumption of innocence. Also note that there is a concept called "harmless error" ("Well, the jury shouldn't have seen him in shackles, but it was only for 30 seconds, and there was lots of evidence against him anyway.").
A few questions of law do require some examination of the facts of the alleged crime. For example, the Defense may allege that the prosecution failed to introduce sufficient evidence to convict Ross, which would violate his right to due process of law. However, as long as there was sufficient evidence introduced that SOME jury COULD legitimately find Ross guilty, the verdict will not be overturned.
Criminal defendants overwhelmingly lose appeals. The most common defense wins are on technical issues such as whether a specific sentencing enhancement under the sentencing guidelines was correctly applied. A win based upon deficiencies in the government's case is exceedingly rare. 
TLDR: Don't hold your breath.

However, if you don't know the secret code that proves you control that unit of Bitcoin, you are always at the mercy of the secret code holder (Coinbase) going bankrupt, stealing your Bitcoin, being commanded by the government to not pay out your Bitcoin, et cetera. That's why people say: not your private keys, not your Bitcoin.
Coinbase is essentially acting like a bank, saying "don't you worry your pretty little head about hard things like secret codes. We'll take care of that for you." Just like a bank stores your cash and valuables. It's a lot of trust to give them.

Yes. 2 things: 
1. Banks (in the USA) are federally insured. I don't think Coinbase is. So bankruptcy or theft is covered by the government for a bank.
2. Part of the fundamental guiding principle of many early Bitcoin pioneers is that the current banking system, where banks are free to lend out the money deposited, and only keep a tiny bit available for withdrawal, is immoral. It creates a danger of bank runs causing insolvency, and encourages banks to take wild risks with depositor money, knowing that they will be bailed out by the government if they go bust. The bank acts like it merely stores your money, but really, that money is gone. Some people believe that's a fundamentally unethical business model. If your money can be seized or confiscated, is it really yours?

To me, the most irreproducable aspect of Bitcoin is its extraordinarily unlikely odds of yielding its creator financial rewards. Only someone with a true passion for cryptography and monetary stability would have dared to spend the time to devise Bitcoin, with its odds of success being infinitesimally small. 
Now that Bitcoin has proved that cryptocurrency creation can be financially lucrative, every grifter, scam-artist, and get-rich-quick yahoo has infiltrated the space. Even the coins that begin with honest intentions are soon infiltrated by schemers.
As Bitcoin has turned rancorous, I've investigated other cryptocurrencies a bit. Every one of them I've looked at has a massive premine or some other sketchy aspect that makes it look like a con game.

Problem: Bitcoin as currently existing has serious limits to how many transactions it can process. It is near its capacity limit. ("Blocks are full").
One group believes that the way to increase the limit is to increase the size of the blocks. Seems simple enough. This group also states that they are concerned about high fees. (People have to pay more for a ticket when space is limited.).
The other group sees too big a downside to increasing the size of the blocks, namely, that increasing block size will make the blockchain too big. If the blockchain gets too big, then normal computer users cannot keep the blockchain on their computers. If normal users can't verify the blockchain, then only large corporations will have the resources for a full copy of the blockchain. This defeats the whole idea that anyone can verify the transaction history to prove that it is their coin. Worst case situation, if only a few large corporations keep the complete records, the government can shut down Bitcoin by applying political or legal pressure on the corporations to restrict it. This group wants to scale other ways. Segwit is a way to keep the same block size, but to improve efficiency so that more can fit in the same size block.
The other group rejects this approach, so they forked to a new coin, Bitcoin Cash, which rejects SegWit and permits bigger blocks. Some miners want this. I frankly don't understand exactly why.
It finally made sense to me when I understood the connection between decentralization and a small blockchain.
@_date: 2017-08-27 12:13:15
One thing completely unique and unreproducable about Bitcoin is the sheer improbability of it leading to financial success for its creator. This ensures that it was created with integrity, which provides lasting value.
Because, ever since Bitcoin, people see "oh, this can make you rich", most new cryptocurrencies offer generous subsidies to their creators. (E.g. "Premines"). The incentive to pump and dump is also extremely strong. This creates a fundamentally unfair playing field. In contrast, Satoshi posted about Bitcoin in a public forum, where anyone interested in cryptography could see it, and could be a part of mining from the very start. He also proved that there was no premine by putting a verifyable date in the genesis block.
I am not saying that there is no value to altcoins, but it is very hard to sort the wheat from the chaff. It requires technical knowledge for beyond mine.

Also an actual lawyer. I'm curious what you practice. I practice criminal defense. My clients enjoy the presumption of innocence while sitting innocent, pretrial, in a jail cell, while they lose their housing and jobs and have their kids taken away. 
I frantically swim upstream solo against a police department with all the resources in the worldthat has a 6-12 month head start in the investigation. If I ask for a continuance to try catch up, I "toll speedy trial" and my client sits in jail even longer. Although my client is accused of firing one shot, they indict him with four offenses because they allege four people were in the vicinity. He faces fourty years; then the plea offers roll in. 
Some presumption of innocence. Yes, the 1% of defendants who are tenacious or self-defeating enough to make it to trial will have the jury instructed that the defendant is entitled to a presumption of innocence, as he sits there with a black eye and cuts on his face from being jumped in jail. And then one hopes against hope that the instruction of the "presumption of innocence" will register against "well, the police wouldn't have pulled him in if he didn't do it...".

Bitcoin Cash is not a viable future proposition. Once the block reward shrinks to 3 BCH or 1.5 BCH per block, how will they fund the network? 3 BCH is only 6 years away.

Walk into any casino and watch the lambs heading to the slaughter. Thousands of working (and unemployed) men and women, throwing away their meager paychecks from their hours of backbreaking labor at the factory, or from cleaning hotel rooms, or from the office, on games that are provable losers. There is no mathematical way to win at roulette or slot machines. It doesn't take a mathematical proof either - just a little common sense tells you that the casino is going to make way more money than they pay out, because they have to pay their employees and keep the lights on. But people keep coming for the flashing lights and the irrational hope that they might win.
This is all to say that the median person is basically incapable of rationally engaging with the concepts of bitcoin, let alone the tech. Long term thinking, cost vs. benefit analysis, and evaluation of tradeoffs are not things average people do.
Now that adoption has spread, it's natural to have a whole bunch of slot machine junkies feeding their student loan payouts into the bitcoin casino and obsessing about whether they got a flashing jackpot or not. "Up" or "Down" is frankly about as sophisticated a concept as the average person can grasp. Hoping for rationality is a losing battle. Just let the casino flow off you like water off a duck's back and *you* be rational and intelligent. Hoping for others to do so is a fool's game.

Interesting. 
Assuming all employees at minimum wage both then and now, a worker was paid 2.45 Big Macs/Hour in 1972, compared to 1.81 Big Macs/Hour today (Big Mac = $3.99; Minimum Wage = $ 7.25). 
If the employees stick around get some raises, let's assume a $2.00/hour wage in 1972 and a $10.00 hour/wage today, the 1972 worker was paid 3.07 Big Macs per hour and the 2017 worker gets 2.50 Big Macs per hour. 
And that's under an assumption that favors the 2017 worker, because it grants them a larger salary increase. Looks like labor has been losing ground.

The poster above has terrible advice, IMO.
Credit unions are typically member-owned and member-directed non-profits. They arose to serve the employees of large companies to promote saving and allow them to access credit when they couldn't do so otherwise.
Banks are typically publicly held for-profit corporations, paying profits to shareholders.
Banks and credit unions are also regulated by different agencies, but the impact of that to the consumer is negligible. The average American will get better service, better interest rates, lower fees, and more credit flexibility with a credit union than a bank. 
The one big downside to credit unions used to be access to ATMs, but nowadays, the credit unions have a national confederation that allows you to go to any credit union nationwide to use ATMs. So I don't see a downside.

The group of people who wanted bigger blocks created their own coin. That coin, Cash, uses the same "math problem" for mining new blocksas Bitcoin does. 
Because Bitcoin was much more valuable than Cash, no one would want to mine Cash, so Cash created a cheat. The cheat basically temporarily sets the mining level on Cash to 'easy mode'. So, while normally it is more profitable to mine Bitcoin than Cash, when Cash triggers 'easy mode' it is temporarily more profitable to mine Cash. So many miners switch over to Cash, leaving less miners on Bitcoin. So, less miners means less blocks, which builds up a backlog of transactions.
Make no mistake, long term this cheat is terrible for Cash. (And even they've decided to remove it. It's gone as of tomorrow.) It causes complete unpredicatability and instability to Cash. But in the meantime, it's an inconvenience to Bitcoin as well.
The company with the most mining power is a big advocate of Cash. They appear to think that if Cash supplants Bitcoin, than they control the whole system, which is likely correct. So, they seem to have organized a pump of Cash to try to convince people that Cash is taking over before their cheat is eliminated and it becomes more difficult for them to lure miners again.

There's a big block solution already. Those people are gone. 
The only problems with full blocks have occurred because of attacks: (1) Spam attacks, and (2) BCash's EDA, which was specifically chosen to steal hashrate from Bitcoin.
Neither of those attacks are helped by 2 MB blocks. The BCash issue should be resolved by now. As for spam attacks, it is as trivially easy to spam 2 MB blocks full as to spam 1 MB blocks full. And it's equally easy to spam 8 MB blocks full, but that causes much more damage. Imagine 80+ MB/day of spam transactions. This is why BCash will fail.

BTC is decentralized. Anyone can run a node and nodes are run all over the world by individuals. It is impossible for any single government to shut down.
BCH is essentially owned by one company in China. While anyone *can* run a node, most nodes are operated by that company, and the long term planning of BCH does not include independent node operation. This means the Chinese government can essentially take over BCH whenever they want to.

There is no serious claim that he was wrongfully convicted. People dont like the drug war, thats all.
At some point, theres an argument that the sentence is inherently unfair and worthy of a commutation. I think there's an argument to be made here, for a first time offender who, perhaps, was suffering a disconnect from the reality that he was one of the world's biggest drug dealers because computers just make the stuff youre doing not seem real. Even though it is real.
Then again, uncharged conduct can be considered in sentencing. And it can certainly be considered in assessing whether we should use our capital as individuals and a community in focusing on this guy.
And the uncharged conduct here is: he apparently thought he was ordering executions of rivals, but these executions were actually law enforcement shams.
And then you wonder why the conduct wasnt prosecuted if it actually happened.
But then you realize that the conduct is right there in the diaries on his computer, and I havent heard any good argument for why to doubt the contents of these diary entries.

There is not an endless amount of Bitcoin. The fact that the creation rate of Bitcoin is regulated by mathematics is one of it's most appealing elements. The inflation rate is 12.5 Bitcoin every 10 minutes. Every 4 years, that halves. Currently, there are 17 million Bitcoin; mathematics dictates that there will only ever be 21 million Bitcoin, a limit approached in 2140. You can see that the quantity is the opposite of endless.
You could use Bitcoin for a major purchase, like buying a house, and some people have. For many people, Bitcoin has use in sending currency across borders, or buying items without doing currency exchange. One other major advantage is that Bitcoin transfers are essentially irreversable after 10 minutes or so - no more "charge backs" against vulnerable vendors.

This is a great question and something that we can’t possibly spend enough time thinking about and planning for.
Clearly, it is profitable for many miners to mine at a price of $3000 per coin, and 13 BTC per block (12.5 BTC in block rewards plus, let’s assume, 0.5 BTC in fees).
(We also know that it was profitable for many miners to mine at a price of $400 per coin, 25.5 BTC per block, in 2013. )
Assuming a constant price, if the fee market rose to 13 BTC per block, it would not be less profitable to mine BTC than it is today. 
How can we accomplish that? Can we fit 25x as many BTC transactions in a block with lightning and other efficiency and batching improvements?

I guess it is a matter of opinion. Different investors may view it differently. I personally do not see any downside to a certain undetermined percentage of BTC being lost. First, I don't know what the solution is - people lose money sometimes, like when a fiat wallet falls off a boat and into the ocean. No one knows the exact percentage of lost fiat either.
Second, what really matters to me is that my holdings are not diluted. The 21 million coin limit is all I need to know to evaluate that my BTC has worth.
If you are involved in selling a product that requires near certain knowledge of the exact money supply at any given moment, and needs to account for lost coins, perhaps some other crypto is better suited to your needs, for example, one that regenerates new coins to replace coins that haven't moved in a year. I can't see how it matters to the average bloke though.

One of the major reasons that banks do this is to make sure that the money is your money, not a loan.

Well, if you buy it from your neighbor, you're buying it from your neighbor.
If you buy it from a match-up service like LocalBitcoins, you're buying it from a seller on LocalBitcoins. 
If you buy it from an exchange like Coinbase, you are sending them your fiat money and receive a credit in an account saying that they will credit you 1 Bitcoin, like a bank deposit. When you wish to withdraw that Bitcoin, you rely on Coinbase to reach into their stock of bitcoins, and send a Bitcoin to whatever address you tell them to send it to, like a bank wire.
In other words, just like a car or a euro or a hamburger, you can buy a Bitcoin from anyone who owns Bitcoin. Once you understand how Bitcoin is mined, the rest of the process is fairly straightforward.

The rights of accused people, both innocent and guilty, are often trampled by prosecutors to get wins. This is terrible conduct that should be condemned. However, condemning the prosecutors for their conduct does not equate to valorizing the guilty person.
In Ulbricht's case, it seems like there's overwhelming evidence that he committed the vast majority of the acts of that the government accused him of. The issue of whether prosecutorial misconduct should give him a new trial is a legal question, not a moral one.
@_date: 2018-04-26 12:54:15
Not if there's scaling. If today, an average block gives a miner 12 BTC in mining reward and 3 BTC in fees, with no block reward, 15 BTC in fees would need to be generated to match this.
If today the 3 BTC come from 1000 transactions a block, in the future, 5000 transactions a block would be able to create 15 BTC in fees, without any change to the fee for any given transaction. 
This is why the lightning network is so important.

A violation of the Fourth Amendment is significant prior to trial,  but the appropriate mechanism is to file a motion to suppress seeking to have the evidence which results from the violation excluded at trial.
Trial is not an appropriate venue for raising Fourth Amendment violations.  Once you're at the jury trial stage, your Fourth Amendment arguments are out the window. Either you lost your motion to suppress, or you waived your issues by failing to raise them earlier.

Appeals are overwhelmingly about defects in the trial process. They are emphatically NOT about second-guessing the jury.
Even with a good issue, appeals are very rarely won by defendants, especially on major issues (versus, for example, a sentencing technicality). A charitable view of why defendants so rarely win appeals are because the judge must heavily weigh a jury's verdict and must only override it in extreme circumstances. A less charitable view is that appellate judges are political animals and government appointees (and often former prosecutors) who don't like criminal defendants, like law enforcement, and search for ways to avoid reversing convictions. 
Plausible winners on appeal would be:
- the judge prevented the defense from presenting key evidence or a defense witness
- the judge unfairly restricted the defense ability to question the prosecution's witnesses.
- the prosecutor kicked off all the jurors who were a particular race.
- the defense lawyer was so incompetent that he could not be truly said to be functioning as an attorney - e.g. slept through much of the trial.
- the prosecutor hid key exculpatory evidence from the defense. (Technically a postconviction, and not an appellate remedy.)
Preventing Andreas et al from testifying is theoretically such an issue, but very unlikely to win (defense gave notice of witnesses late, judge had reasonable grounds to question expertise based on vague c.v., state's evidence could be deemed 'overwhelming' regardless of what the experts could have testified to.)
So, basically procedural deficiencies are at play, not a rehash of if the jury was right or wrong.

As defense lawyers, we generally try to keep as many options open as we can. Our thought process for planning a defense is: "It wasn't my client. But if it was him, it wasn't a theft; he had permission to take it. But even if he did steal it, it might not have happened in the court's jurisdiction", and so on.
That said, the example above is an exaggeration - almost all cases involve some admissions and concessions in order to formulate a defense theory (e.g. If we see a strong claim of self defense, we'll have to admit that our client was there and got into an altercation.) 
But it's a tough call to abandon that thinking, put all your eggs in one basket, and essentially give the state one of the elements they have to prove. You're conceding that the servers are his and that he has involvement in their contents. The defense lawyer was probably trying to hedge his bets between "wasn't me" and "even if I did, don't convict (due to illegal seizure)", and he got stuck with one foot each way. In hindsight, maybe he should have seen "wasn't me" wouldn't fly, but that's very hard to do, particularly when your client is selling "wasn't me" to you as hard as he can. 
I don't know if Ulbricht was selling "wasn't me" to his attorney, but that would be my suspicion.

Sometimes there are laws that we disagree with, but we are still expected to follow them. The alternative - that persons only follow the laws they personally agree with - leads to an unworkable civilization. 
Civil disobedience is a valid exception if a law truly is abhorrent to your conscience. I don't believe that running an online drug market for tremendous profit is a legitimate act of civil disobedience - it's just being a drug dealer. 
El Chapo may pour 50% of his drug gang profits into building rural schools and infrastructure for all I know, but it doesn't legitimate his drug cartel.

Omg, I'm so confused at this point. I tried to follow it all, but I officially give up. Every day there's a whole new soap opera and more forks than an Olive Garden

Good analysis, but I still expect a large impact.
You’re looking at the “active pool”. I guess the question will be: what’s more important, the active pool, or the number of newly generated coins per day? Stated otherwise, how elastic is the demand of the sellers in the market? How much comes from miners who must sell  in order to pay their bills versus traders and investors who are making a choice to sell? If a lot of the sales volume is inelastic (miners who must sell for fiat to make payroll), then newly generated coins per day is the more important metric. And newly generated coins per day is still going to be reduced by 50%.

A classic. Never gets old.

You're bringing back memories of 15-year-old me reading "Strategic Investment" (their newsletter).

As a defense attorney, I hate criticizing other defense attorneys, because I know full well how difficult the strategic choices to be made are, and how much decision-making depends upon factors and data which is unknown to outside observers. 
But this article is absolutely accurate as to the lawyering strategies involved, and the defense's choices are incomprehensible to me. Dratel should have been doing everything possible to sell his client and the prosecutor on a plea bargain of any kind. (Not that we can say that he wasn't trying to get a plea, but that's not the impression I get.)
A really nicely written piece by someone who's done their research.
