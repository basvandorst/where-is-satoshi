bitcoin.de is the best anyway, people outside of europe dont even imagine how easy fiat/crypto can be...
@_date: 2018-01-26 09:05:12
The funny thing is, its so obvious i start to doubt if they are really that ignorant... i mean, everyone now know that futures expire today and the motherfuckers from wallstreet shorting crypto, but i though maybe they can try to hide their actions... but they dont, so obvious...

@_date: 2017-12-29 15:52:16

How this time is different from 2013,2014,2015,2016,2017... because every year there was " a bubble " which was about to burst any moment, it didnt... how this time its the bubble?? so many holders from the first days who did not sold until now, you think these people will sell?? 
Look at the support line, people buying like mad if it dips, and will continue to buy. because its an invest into the network, its not a stock.
