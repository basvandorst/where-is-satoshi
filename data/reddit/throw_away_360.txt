they wrote on their site that they want to implement it in "2018" but it's not their highest priority.

Just wait it will go through eventually.
Don't buy with coinbase, you pay 1,5% to buy and 1,5% to sell.
GDAX  ist the coinbase-owned exchange, you can login there with your coinbase account.
0% fees to buy and 0%/0.30% fees to sell. 
Save your money.
Buy at ~11.0k € and hold (and i mean 11k € at GDAX, not coinbase. the price you see on coinbase is not the price that is currently being traded with -&gt; gdax always trades around 700$ higher)

mining is not worth it anymore
literally buy 100$ of bitcoin and sell 2 hours later if the price has gone up a bit and you make more than 2 days farming bitcoin

Great work :p
@_date: 2018-01-01 20:52:09
its going to go to 50k 2018 mark my words
@_date: 2018-01-07 19:25:33
What kind of question is that?
You must decide yourself if the current price is favorable or not.
You can buy 10x 0.1 BTC or an entire Bitcoin.
If you check 'Post only' you won't pay fees (only 0.30% otherwise)
I would generally advise to not pump all your money into btc at once, at least if it's not a dip. If the price goes down you safe money down the line.

if I make 100$ and immediately lose 200$ so that im in the negative i don't have to pay anything though right?
@_date: 2019-07-21 09:09:13
And if the price drops to 5k and stays there for 2 years, and you sell at 5k then you lost half your money
@_date: 2019-07-11 09:12:36
@_date: 2019-07-27 08:10:27
Look at the price chart from 2014 to today and decide if now is a good time to invest
@_date: 2019-07-21 09:12:43
Never use coinbase again, it's a ripoff.
on pro.coinbase.com you see the price moving in realtime and you can set a price at which it automatically buys/sells (beside many more options) and the fees are way lower.
There even used to be NO fees but they added some fees, like 0.15%

giving up beer for a little bit of lottery money is a great idea. keep it up.
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:36:34
Hm I'm considering this.
What's your opinion on gdax? But on gdax and transfer to hardware wallet?
gdax vs gemini?

I'll stick to BTC for my first buy. 
Maybe later ETH don't know enough about ETH yet though.

And always those comments under elon musk's tweets
Fake elon musk accounts telling people to send their bitcoin and they will send 2 times the amount etc 
Crazy thing is I checked those addresses and there were movements of like 30+ bitcoins on there ...

Don't you think all of our countries operating on debt will someday cause major issues?
Edit: Alright I have no idea about enonomics, I admit it. Let's wait and see.
@_date: 2019-08-20 11:30:56
It doesn't have anything to do with crypto
OP says our current debt levels are a bubble and I agreed with him
we're not even talking about bitcoin in this threat i think
@_date: 2019-08-02 18:52:19
Oh no lord almighty forgive me for my typo it was not intentional !1!
Well they wanted a picture of mine, probably to verify age or something, thats just how it is
@_date: 2019-08-20 13:57:06
Imo, this is more about the national debt than about crypto.
It just suggests that compared to crypto, debt is a much bigger bubble, but nobody is talking about it. 
But I guess we can different opinions

Now my life savings are gone :(

You DONT make loans to invest money
For such matters head over to r/wallstreetbets
No, seriously, only invest what you can afford to lose.

Don't have to pay taxes if I'm only losing money :)
@_date: 2019-08-19 07:55:11
If you don't know about the subject then don't take it.
Unless there's no other buyers of course, then listen to the other commenters.
If you haven't done your research then just take plain old fiat, you can buy bitcoin yourself with that with no hassle at all.
@_date: 2019-08-21 07:41:58
'Bubble' is the wrong word for us financing our government through debt then, but the issue is the same.
But let's be honest I don't work in economics so I don't know a whole lot about all of that, it's just common sense that one day this will become an issue.

I'm trying to convince you to not throw your money away
options trading is risky as fuck
@_date: 2019-08-19 08:51:00
What sites reported news of this before today?
This is pretty important after all, somehow nobody was talking about it
@_date: 2019-08-20 11:17:11
Gambling is bullshit and should just be done for shits and giggles, like 5$ on a football game
@_date: 2019-08-19 07:50:39
So you believe in it enough to put your money where your mouth is?
Then take a look at the price swings of the last 5ish years, currently it's massively up, and what goes up will go down. "To the moon in one go" is a meme. Instead of bagholding for a year or two how about you wait until the stock you want to buy is not near all time high

japanese amazon "rakuten" launched their crypto exchange today
I mean if europe/americas amazon launched a crypto exchange it would be on the frontpage for sure
Price just went up like 600$
@_date: 2019-08-01 16:45:24
These responses are all not very helpful
pro.conbase.com has little fees when you want to buy/sell bitcoin, like 0.15%
You need to sign up with your passport and shit..
But right now I would not really buy bitcoin tbh, just look at the prices for the last 3 years, all depends on you though
@_date: 2019-08-18 22:25:51
What font are you using for this?
@_date: 2019-08-19 08:49:12
Serious question, how was nobody talking about this launch today? It's pretty big news overall.
Is there a reliable source of important bitcoin news, related to market movements?
@_date: 2019-08-19 07:52:27
Can confirm would be up a whopping 70$ if I sold now (3k in BTC)
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:54:20
am I selling now?
I bought at nearly the same price 2 years ago and now I'm almost even ... was down 70% and don't want it go down again ahhhhh
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:05:51
@_date: 2019-08-18 23:28:35
And other suggestions?
Concentrate on your career, move up the ladder and make more money. A stable income is much more important than speculating with crypto currencies.
There's no free money in this world, for every crypto winner there's a crypto loser
@_date: 2019-06-24 19:36:19
dont buy

Can someone explain to me what is supposed to happen on September 23rd?
@_date: 2019-09-03 10:07:35
What is the problem?
You go to pro.coinbase.com, you select the currency (BTC-&gt;USD for example)
then at the left side you see the buy/sell buttons, you select a value and hit 'go'
Pretty intuitive, no?
And about the time it takes for your bank to transfer your money to coinbase, nothing can be done about that..

I once looked up such a bitcoin address that they want the people to send the bitcoin/eth to.
And there were like 500.000$ on there... and an ongoing stream of small additions
Are people REALLY this stupid?
