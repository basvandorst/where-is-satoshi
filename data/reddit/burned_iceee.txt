@_date: 2017-12-14 11:44:48
Well said
@_date: 2017-12-30 03:59:38
Ok, so its really like coinbase.
What do you mean by: "and the pre-credit them so you immediately have the funds to buy, but you can't transfer anything you buy/sell off the exchange until the ACH transfer fully clears."?

@_date: 2017-12-31 06:14:29
Thanks! Ill take this with a grain of salt, but overall extremely helpful and summarized!
@_date: 2017-12-30 04:31:21
Yeah I fully agree with you on that part lol. Like I was saying, I think coinbase is atrocious regulatory and speed wise. Ontop of the already horrible customer support and restrictions they apply and bugs that seem to come out of nowhere on their websites.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:58:24
are you  able to deposit and withdraw from your card, bank account or paypal?
@_date: 2017-12-31 07:19:32
I think they basically mean the regulated, centralized, government binding currencies like USD, EUR, Etc...
@_date: 2017-12-31 07:48:11
Ahh ok, thanks!
@_date: 2017-12-15 07:08:50

You're kidding right?
@_date: 2017-12-31 06:28:00
Thank you!
@_date: 2017-12-14 12:34:09
If you're trying to figure out how to buy and sell using your bank or card, to and from counbase, you can use a PayPal account. Works for me!
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:28:49
I feel your pain man
@_date: 2017-12-30 03:40:41
As far as I know, coinbase is one of very few companies that deal and comply with government regulations... that's why they don't have more alt coins, are required to verify documents, include tax information involving their company, and I think even limits and fees too, along with many other restrictions. Anyone should feel free to correct me if I'm wrong, but I think the government is part of the reason coinbase is so awful... not service wise (That is strictly coinbase's fault), but regulatory and speed wise.

Oh okay, that sounds amazing! Thank you for being such an amazing help m8! This sounds like exactly what I need. Just one or two more questions, 
1) Does the same apply to withdraws from gemini to your bank... where it credits your bank while the transaction time is processing, that way you dont lose money when a price drops and you're still waiting on the transfer? 
2) What are the fees like on gemini compared to coinbase?
@_date: 2017-12-30 06:22:59
Lol ok, thanks!
But I meant like... because the transfers take a few days, the BTC price could fluctuate and decrease. while its decreasing, is gemini going to make a scummy move and deposit what its worth when it decreases, or will they immediately convert your btc to usd, and hold that usd value while they transfer usd to your bank?
(someone told me an exchange does what I said above, I want to make sure Gemini doesn't, im sure they dont, but I want to make sure)
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:20:15
nice! thank you!
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:58:21
I read through their announcements, I thought they already did update to segwit?
For future reference, how can I tell in the future if a company is using segwit, blockchain, etc.?
@_date: 2017-12-30 03:44:52
I signed up for gemini earlier, but I left for a reason I cant remember... but I forgot to check for something and I was wondering if you could help me?
Does gemini let you withdraw and deposit to your bank account/paypal account?
@_date: 2017-12-15 11:44:10
yeah, thats what i do
@_date: 2017-12-31 05:19:13

@_date: 2017-12-27 04:21:26
nicely put

Same, I somehow partially got out of this coinbase trap earlier today, it took 4 hours for my money to transfer to binance, and was only just now able to buy some ripple... not much, but enough to feel comfortable. Lol I started at 10am, and it took me an entire day to get just a few ripple... ridiculous though
