1/ Arbitrators are bonded. 20.000 BSQ today. 
Why do you say there is "a lack of clear politics around dispute resolution" ?
2/ Bisq runs now for more than 2 years, and had zero issues like the one related.
Yes, this is certainly partly due to Bisq being actually a small market place. But mainly it is due to the fact that Bisq is rather conservative (and Bisq is criticized for that) and that Bisq has cautious mechanisms already in place which exactly make the kind of above scenario impossible.
The worst cases we had on Bisq are 2 or 3 fiat dishonest chargebacks. 48 hours after knowing those problems, without long procastination, Bisq removed the concerned payment methods from the allowed list. Please name some centralized platform working this way ?

The last Bisq version (v0.8.0) includes F2F (Face to Face) trading.
So you now can make offers near your location.
See : [ for explanations
It's very new (august 22th), so there are not so much offers at the moment, but it is slightly growing.
Bisq F2F Offer Book is published monday-saturday in r/bisq

\- ... about webserver security : one fresh news among hundreds : [ 
it seems me obvious you are less at risk with an open-source software, designed specifically for safety/privacy, running on a P2P network over Tor, than using a webservice logging 20 times your IP, every of your click, as long as gov agencies ask them ... and hacked every week because they hold your money. Bisq holds 0 money from traders. Bisq stores nothing =&gt; there is nothing to store for hackers
\- concerning fees, the mining fees may vary depending on bitcoin mempool congestion. But the applying fees are displayed on the moment the user decides, or not, to take a trade. In the last 3 months, I remember one user paying high fees because he just traded at a moment where the BTC mempool was congested, and he wasn't attentive when hiting the yes button. (maybe it was you ?)

Bisq has actually 2 arbitrators (among 3 or 4 possibles).
There is also some relay.
At the moment, 2 arbitrators are enough, simply because Bisq has very few arbitration issues.
We are ready to have more arbitrators involved as the trading grows.
(Btw, contributors/developers/etc are very welcome on board.)

Bisq provides a bitcoin address which is strictly meant to be used for the duration of the trade. And not more.
After that, it is written and recommended to transfer the result of your trades to your own external (long term) wallet(s).
If some people decide to use those address as wallets, what can Bisq do against that ?
There is nothing as a "Bisq wallet", it's pure vanilla bitcoin addresses, how these bitcoins addresses are used is under the responsability of the user.
Bisq is a market place . It helps buyers and sellers to match the most safely possible, that's all.

Bisq :
\- secures exchanges thru limited amounts when dealing with fiat
\- secures exchanges thru use of multisig adress
\- secures exchanges by asking mutual deposits
\- provides a human arbitrator in (rare) case of dispute
atm Bisq is a small marketplace, with an average of \~30 trades per day, but since the beginning Bisq has (very) few arbitration cases, and absolutely 0 case like this one.
There were some few case of chargeback issues, but limited due to Bisq limit policy with fiat. In the 24H/48H following those issues, the concerned payment methods were removed from Bisq (even if it was of course a bizness loss).

I'm helping with Bisq support since \~ 3 months, and I didn't see any nightmare horror story.
There were worries in dec 2017/jan 2018, mainly due to numerous network issues, because the Tor network (on which Bisq P2P network is set) was under repeated heavy DOS attacks. But fortunately this seems finished.
And BTW, Bisq proposes F2F trading since it's last version.

No. At least certainly not this exact scenario.
1/ Bisq has limits (often criticized by many people) which would simply not have allowed to reach the amount related in the scenario
2/ if there is an issue between buyers and sellers, the deposits get at worse blocked in the 2/3 multisig deposits address. afaik this did never happen since Bisq network is running.
3/ The case where an arbitrator could become rogue has been considered. To become an arbitrator in Bisq, you have to bond some money (currently it is 20.000 BSQ) and you must be approved by the stakeholders. For an arbitrator to become rogue, the gain must at least be superior to the bond. Plus definitely losing its arbitrator role/job at Bisq. atm this didn't happen, and I doubt it will happen in a near or mid-term future. Bisq's code is open-source, and Bisq's working is also very open. This is quite a different way of doing things.

There are arbitrators whose job is to make a decision in the event of a dispute.
It must be however pointed that disputes are very rare, although Bisq has an average of 30 transactions per day.
There was a rather good article some months ago about Bisq in CoinIQ :
Bisq Review: Secure and Private Peer-to-Peer Trading  
(Bisq is now v0.7.1 and many features have been added.)
