They will just declare bankruptcy because of your lawsuit.  That means all your funds will be liquidated, the lawyers will suck out milions of dollars in legal fees, and you'll still take a 36% haircut.
All this after 3-5 years of having your money locked up.
Truly idiotic.
@_date: 2016-08-05 13:04:46
Your arguement makes no sense.  Exchanges need human fail safes. Its called cold storage.
@_date: 2016-08-05 01:10:44
Actually, if they **don't** socialize losses a class action is guaranteed.   With socialized losses at least there is a chance that enough people are happy with a small haircut

Over the past week a half dozen scam wallets have been approved that just steal users Bitcoins.  It's become clear that Apple will need to create a new policy for all Crypto-Currency wallets before they are approved.
That means extensive code review and proper ID verification of Developers/Companies listing Bitcoin wallets from here on out.   No more fucking around.  Every time someone is robbed by bullshit like this , it sets back the growth of this industry and gives Bitcoin a bad name.
**The VC's who have made a combined investment in Bitcoin to date of over $1 Billion all have connections to Apple executives**.
Do none of you care about the industry you have invested $1 Billion dollars in??  *There is no excuse for inaction. * 
Contact Apple today and put and end to this bullshit.
**EDIT:**  Alright, code review seems like it might not be reasonable.  But, at the very least, Apple should make sure they have verified ID's of the Developers submitting the wallets.

**THIS. BitGo is absolutely also liable. They signed the transactions !!**
@_date: 2016-08-05 00:53:08
Is the 63% haircut correct?
Why aren't the losses being socialized across all depositors?  It's not fair to just have BTC holders take the losses.  The total USD loss should be shared by all depositors.
Otherwise, I think many BTC holders will just move forward with a class action lawsuit to put the company into bankruptcy and/or receivership where all the assets (USD+BTC+ETH+LTC+ETC) are considered fair game for compensation for losses.
Class action lawsuits should also be applied to BitGo because they are half responsible for the coins since they signed half the transaction.  BitGo and Bitfinex should both pay $40m to make everyone whole.
@_date: 2016-08-04 21:51:09
It's the law.
@_date: 2016-08-03 20:25:44


Yes. You are.  You're responsible for making sure your customers aren't going to fuck up and cause damage to your brand when they lose $75mm because you were too lazy to check exactly what they were doing , or provide them with best practices.
@_date: 2016-08-04 00:27:30
Yes, legally, your deposits become liabilities in a bankruptcy court if Bitfinex is sued.
@_date: 2016-08-04 23:07:18
**THIS. BITGO IS ALSO LIABLE!! THEY SIGNED THE TRANSACTIONS!!**
@_date: 2016-08-04 23:09:19
Sorry, its how the law works.

"While the haircut % has not been made public yet, most reports range from 45% to 30%..."
Where did you see this? Everything on reddit says 63% so far
@_date: 2016-08-04 22:31:28
Oh yeah guys, we'll just make this awesome API feature to let you lift your withdrawal limits.  Oh yeah, and its the same API key that you use to withdraw BTC...  So, if your API key is compromised, you're fucked!! Just like a hot wallet!!
OUR SERVICE IS SO SMART AND GREAT!!!  Keep paying us to use it!! THANKS!!
@_date: 2016-08-05 01:00:58
All exchanges already have human fail safes. It's called cold storage.  Your argument is an epic fail.
@_date: 2016-08-04 17:14:03
All depositors have to share in the loss, it's the only fair way. And this is how it works according to the law (unless bitfinex can make everyone whole on their own).
The only way to make this happen (unless BFX does it themselves) is a forced Bankruptcy and immediate injunction to freeze all deposits/withdrawals by the courts. In a bankruptcy, the depositors funds become assets that creditors can claim damages against.
The timeline on this is **very short**. Paperwork has to be filed yesterday.
@_date: 2016-08-05 01:21:55
It won't be 60% if they socialize losses across all depositors (including USD, ETH, ETC, LTC)
@_date: 2016-08-05 02:18:48
I hope they make it work too. But BFX doesn't decide if it's bankruptcy or not. Creditors can file an injuction or class action demanding payment, and if BFX doesn't pay they are forced into bankruptcy by the courts
@_date: 2016-08-05 01:06:49
All jurisdictions have similar bankruptcy laws. The deposits become assets that creditors can claim against.
Its the law.
@_date: 2016-08-04 23:08:29
THIS. BitGo is absolutely also liable. They signed the transactions !!
@_date: 2016-08-08 19:21:40
Your money is already gone.  They don't have any USD to pay you back, because they owe it to BTC holders.  
Suing will accomplish nothing, and leave you with less money after legal fees.  The best thing to do is keep trading at BFX so the BFX token goes up to $1 in value, then you're made whole.
@_date: 2016-08-03 07:26:12
BitGo:  "Hey Bitfinex!! We're this great security service, you just send us a message with an API from your online servers, and we'll sign it not matter what! Even if **all your customers try to withdraw at the same time. Nothing unusual about that!!**"  
Bitfinex: "Huh, That sounds no better than a hot wallet. Why should we use your service?"
BitGo:  "Not sure, but we're VC backed!! Just talk to our sales guy!"
Bitfinex: "ogmogm great lets do it"!
@_date: 2016-08-03 08:40:25
Smart guys, but the setup was effectively like a hot wallet.  Not very good.
@_date: 2016-08-07 03:44:56
It's amazing that this hack went on for 3 hours, and no flags were raised at Bitfinex or Bitgo.  3 hours!!!  Unbelievable!!
Where was the real-time monitoring?
@_date: 2016-08-04 18:28:48
Because thats what the law says.  All their assets become things that creditors can claim against in bankruptcy proceedings.  Customer deposits become are their assets, and they have a liability to pay them back.  Like it or not, thats the law.
@_date: 2016-08-05 02:08:32
Thanks for replying.  Can you tell us the ratio of BTC vs Other Assets?   What would the % loss be between socializing losses against BTC holders only, vs All deposits?
@_date: 2016-08-05 00:58:31
It's a bad analogy because contents in safety deposit boxes are NOT fungible!!
The proper analogy is equivalent to the bank having 10 vaults of USD, and only one vault is robbed.  In this case, the accounts that were stored in the robbed vault can sue the bank for the losses. If they bank can't pay, they are forced into bankruptcy, which means the other 9 vaults become assets that other creditors can claim against.
@_date: 2016-08-05 02:03:45
Because that's how the law works. In bankruptcy proceedings, all of the deposits become assets of the company, upon which the creditors can lay claims.
@_date: 2016-08-04 21:50:55
No. It's the law.
@_date: 2016-08-05 12:56:56
Just a guess. How else would they have been able to withdraw so much?
There's no way Bitfinex was stupid enough to allow unlimited daily withdrawals, so the hacker must have been able to change this online with the compromised API keys.  (Either that or BitGo's servers were compromised - but they said they weren't!!)
If I'm wrong and BFX had unlimited withdrawals setup, then thats really dumb.  And BitGo would be stupid for telling them "Yeah, we don't see anything wrong with unlimited withdrawals, we'll just sign everything blindly, no problem!" It would be no different than using a 1-of-1 hot wallet -- why would they bother paying BitGo any money?  Just false sense of security for customers?  Thats bad.
@_date: 2016-08-03 21:49:18
Yes, they are.  They knew how much money was at stake, and didn't care to ask BFX what they were doing or giving them any advice.
Totally irresponsible.

That's not true.  Whatever the economic majority decides to run will be BTC.
Mining has nothing to do with it.  Miners work for the network, not the other way around. They can be fired at any time by the users.

2*pi = pi + pi.  Therefore, it's increasingly clear. QED.
@_date: 2017-03-20 18:47:39
doesn't realize that changing the proof-of-work doesn't prevent miners from mining!   GPU miners are more decentralized that ASIC miners!
@_date: 2017-03-19 20:24:38
That's irrelevant. No Core developer should have to have work with a threat of lawsuit hanging over them.
What if the devs and community decide that Casper sytle proof of work is better for Bitcoin than PoW mining?   They can't do it because the Centralized Cartel called Bitfury will sue them?
"You're doing a great job as long as you do what we say or we'll sue you".   That's hostile.

This is actually a lie.  It's about $0.5T when you consider that coinmarketcap only calculates 'circulating' supply and not locked up tokens.
This isn't how real capital markets calculate market caps.  
Coinmarketcap is a huge reason we have a bubble as people think things are valued less than they really are.
They should fix it.   But everyone benefits from the pump so they won't.

In an orderly market where the exchange is not front running or rigged, there is NO such thing as manipulation, there are ONLY bids and asks.
If you want to buy all the asks up to the moon that's your perogative.

This is why cloud companies make so much money.
Because it "doesn't bother you" that you gave them 1BTC, but only got 0.5BTC back.
You lost half your BTC, and they took it from you.
They knew the math and you didn't.
They take 1000 BTC from other people who didn't do the math either and only pay back 500BTC.
And if bitcoin goes up they all say "Oh well, i made money in dollars!"
The customers, like you, are happy when they lose money. It's really a great business. Everyone should start their own cloud mining company.

The fact that krakens software even allows this to happen with no limit checks is absolutely unacceptable.
Nobody should trade on this exchange after seeing something like this.
They have a lot of explaining to do, and the trader who took the loss should file suit for  negligence
