It'll go down to 1K. The astronomical rise in price was caused by Tether. Not sustainable.

That's great. If I were you trying to sell the house faster, I'll just lower the USD fiat price until it sells and use the money for your speculative needs. Now isn't a good time to sell your house for BTC. For example, Bitcoin Cash is up 25% at the moment compared to 0-1% Bitcoin.

In the same time frame? That took like 2 years to fall. Bitcoin took like a month

it was 6500 and  now its 7150. Do you guys not realize that the swings are too severe to be used as money? Gold does not swing like that.

It's a stupid idea. Think about it. If you sold your house while BTC was say 8K to 10K, then it goes down to 4K within a few weeks? It's way too volatile for the house market. Even if BTC goes up to say 15K, will you be able to cash out quickly enough or get greedy and think it will go higher only to see it take a massive dump?

This is really messed up.

Bitcoin is crashing but I admire your perspective.

I'd wait. Bitcoin dropped huge many times before and you will know what the bottom truly is.

Doesn't that tell you something? It's going much lower, otherwise they wouldn't do that.

It's going to less than 1K where it should stabilize. Idiots bought this coin up $20K. Does the DOW crash from 20K to 5K? I think not.
