They just want you to give more money. In reality you're not going to make more money unless you get in early and you dupe more people into signing up into your downstream. It is quite literally a pyramid scheme.
@_date: 2018-01-03 17:30:45
Are we to blame the creator of the internet for the dangers of the internet today? Do we blame the creation of the Federal Reserve for bank heists?
It's hard to imagine, but Bitcoin did exist without exchanges. And whenever one of them goes bust, Bitcoin still goes on to exist. He created the protocol to be trustless. We're the ones that put our trust into institutions like these, not him, and we're the only ones to blame.

It jumped 1k because someone sold their Bitcoin for a car, not the other way around.
@_date: 2018-01-05 16:37:24
That's 100% the issue. I won't put my money in something that I cannot prove is existing. That's the biggest value that Bitcoin and cryptocurrency has for me. I can prove that I have them. 
If a coin does not have transparency, it's a shitcoin. If the scheme requires you to give them your crypto, without evidence of the income method, recruit your friends to do the same, in order to get money in return (only at a lesser degree than previous generations of recruiters), then it at least looks like a Ponzi scheme.
They could prove that it isn't. But why haven't they? It's easy enough with the transparency of transactions that Bitcoin allows. The one thing that could prove that it isn't, is withheld. Just like every Ponzi scheme. 
If something cannot prove the legitimacy of method for it's promise of growth, it is not a good investment. Not now, not ever.

I ordered a Ledger Nano S, is that good enough? What about the transaction fees I need to pay to send to the wallet in the first place? Is there anything I can do about that if I buy from an exchange, or is it ignorant/expensive to buy from an exchange?
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:06:09
If we say that it dropped from 19k to 16k, that's a drop of 16%. 
To put that in perspective: 
On Nov 29, it hit 11.5k and dropped to 9k the day after, a drop of 17%.
@_date: 2017-12-18 06:55:08
That's a 10% dip from 20k. Probably one of the smallest dips ever, if that's where it ended. 
A month ago, dips were around 15% to 20%. Volatility is decreasing.

A better question is, what will happen to Bitcoin if a bubble does exist? Would it matter in the long term? We see regular corrections of upwards of 20% lately, but we've seen adoption increase at rates that far outweigh them. Cryptocurrency at a whole is booming.
People want to imagine that there's a big bear out there waiting to crash the market once futures come out, but I know I'm not the only one who would buy at the dip. That would be a good opportunity for many people.

I agree, it is a big deal. But I don't think it's Wall Street that's embracing BTC through the CME. Wall Street as a whole has still yet to embrace BTC as anything beyond a commodity.

Assuming 1 Lamborghini = $200k USD. If you bought in at 1 BTC = $10k with $53, you would need to see 1 BTC increase by 3,773.58 times to equal $37,735,849.06 before that $53 turns into $200k.

That's being very lenient on Coinbase. I was watching the order books when it crashed. It's very sketchy to me, that anyone would put in orders to buy BCH 3x over market price, but those orders were matched during those 4 minutes. There were also tons of orders to buy 1 BCH for 3 BTC on the BCH/BTC pair as well.
It seems as if bots had access to BCH on gdax before most people did.

Saying something negative about Trump doesn't mean it's pro-Hillary. We get it, she sucks. It doesn't mean Trump and the US Gov't doesn't suck. Don't let your hatred for Hillary blind you from the fact that Trump, as President, isn't the swamp draining, anti-corporate interest, man of the people that he projects himself to be. 
The US government is not going to support cryptocurrency since it has the potential to disrupt the financial system that it controls and benefits from. Trump is not going to change that.

If you do see capital gains on selling that gift, you do have to pay taxes on that gain however. If you were gifted $400 in BTC and it becomes $1600 when you sell it, you have to pay $1600-$400=$1200*(percentage of capital gains tax at tax bracket, which also depends on how long you waited before realizing these gains).
Edit: This is assuming that the gift recipient is paying US taxes.

I agree. It's slow, and expensive to transact with BTC. Is it the end of the world for BTC, though? I don't think so. It's definitely not perfect, but it's secure and resilient. I think that in itself goes a long way. 
It is perfectly okay if another cryptocurrency does transactions better and faster than BTC. Competition is a good thing.

Hold onto it for at least a year. Put in a little more each week/month. Don't freak out if it dips. You only lose if you sell at a low after buying higher.
