Have you looked at the comparisons here?
For lightweight clients, I'd suggest MultiBit.
If you're okay with downloading the blockchain (10 gigs), Bitcoin-QT or armory might be more secure.
They all work generally the same way. Just download one and start playing around.

The address just exists as a mathematical function. It is based off the private key. When someone sends bitcoins to your address the whole network will acknowledge that x bitcoins reside at that public address (but only the private key holder can spend them), it never needed to be online.

It depends on where you live.

Not exactly. Fiat means it's based on trust. You trust that your government will honor your little pieces of paper and exchange them for some other valuable resource.
Bitcoin and gold are not based on trust. They are both scarce and difficult to acquire, unlike bank notes.

it adds security to the file that contains your private key, but it doesn't really fit into the context of this conversation.
if you have a private key, you have access to everything associated with it. the protection is that an astronomical numbers of private keys exist, nothing else. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 23:49:07

your wallet doesn't have money in it. your wallet contains public/private key pairs. think about your public key as a safety deposit box and your private key as the key to that box. duplicating the file just makes more copies of the key to your box.


Do a fresh install of your operating system (to ensure no malware), install your bitcoin client of choice and create your public/private key while not connected to the internet. create backups of these keys (on usb for instance) and wipe them from your hard drive. 
@_date: 2013-11-06 07:03:34
The ability to deal in microbitcoins or satoshis will delay this problem for a long time. In the event that 0.00000001 bitcoins is still too expensive to buy every day items with, the source code can be altered to allow more decimal places.
I see bitcoin being used as something to store value, like gold. The 10-minute block thing is a bit of a hassle if you're just trying to buy a coffee or something. Perhaps we will be using litecoins at that point or some alternative cryptocurrency.

1) Yes. But you should keep your wallet file safe because it contains your private keys.
2) Yes. You'll need to import them to a wallet file though if you want to spend them.
3) I believe it's possible to figure out your public key from your private key, yes.
4) Yes
5) You could use something like the ATM in vancouver, but that would be connected to the internet.
6) No, you don't need any people to issue keys. Your wallet will create them from scratch, and it doesn't even need to be online.
