It started off as an awesome idea - we'll see how well they hold up to the initial promises now that they've had time + an infusion of venture capital.

I didn't see it - that would be interesting to me, can you link me?
You don't know exactly how much they have but you can calculate a min bound at 1% and work from there. They've had $100,000,000 in transaction volume so a minimum bound of $1,000,000 in revenue from inception. They've had two successful rounds of investment from very well-known entrepreneurs who I know wouldn't settle for anything less than a successfully poised business to re-up their investment in this current investment bid.

If you know their payment structure and make assumptions for monthly transaction volume you can easily determine a minimum bound for revenue. If you're interested in whether this is a VC black hole or an actual business with potential, it takes 5 minutes to crunch those numbers....

|You have to make assumptions because they very quickly stopped posting transaction stats as soon as it became clear that the run up to Black Friday wasn't continuing into December. 
In March 2013, they had 4000 transactions and $2 mil in transaction volume. They also hit something like 4000 merchants at that time and were growing at about 1,000 merchants a month at that time. By September 2013, they had 10,000 merchants on board. By January 2014, they hit 20,000 merchants. This month they hit 26,000 merchants. They're a subscription service - do the math....

You don't need central management. There is a core dev team, the concept is worked on as open source, and they've continued to make changes as necessary. And the businesses that operate on BTC pay salaries for several of them - without feeling the need to centrally manage them. What you need is to reward the devs - and that's already happening (at least with btc)...

All 501 (3)(c)'s are required to file financials. Doesn't apply to all organizations that self-classify as "not for profit". If they don't sign for 501 (3)(c) status, they're not restricted by this rule and also don't benefit from that filing status.

The same sort of scenario is possible outside of BTC. You mitigate by rigorously selecting who is actually eligible for insurance based on several factors (business age, predecessor businesses, business' market share, etc.). That's one way you mitigate, secondly, (also on the information page), you mitigate as all insurance companies by the law of large numbers. No single business' monthly transaction volume will constitute a significant portion of the company's assets. Even if there is fraud in some case(s) or real payouts, as with a currency-based insurance company, you continue to function profitably.
If you look at the information page, there are legal contracts that your criminal friend signs with us as well. The businesses that contract with us have given us an extensive amount of information about themselves, their platform and the nature of their business. The contract to except penalties if they break contract (modifications to code base) and accept outside auditing.
Anyways, if that's your single concern about why this project would fail, than I don't believe it's significant. I'm applying my real world actuarial knowledge which is a subset of that applied by Safeco and many other established companies on a smaller level. A single case of fraud, or even multiple cases, based on the the insurance issuing model isn't going to take the company down as a whole.

It doesn't stop it, but BitCoin is basically a shared transactional ledger - money doesn't move "without a trace". It's not difficult to see which addresses the money went to. If I've contracted Billy Bob's business and he was purportedly hacked, than BTC are shown to have moved from his address to another one and eventually to some North American exchange, authorities can identify the person who's identity is used at the exchange. If it's Billy Bob or one of Billy Bob's friends, red lights go off. Once the address with the stolen money is used for a transaction - they run into obvious problems. You're trivializing the laundering aspect of this scenario, $5-6 million don't just disappear without a trace and without alerting authorities. Even of the many BTC that have been stolen in various scams, so many addresses have been sitting dormant and unable to convert.
And it goes back to the law of large numbers, even if there were cases of fraud, it wouldn't do anything to shut down the company. It would reduce the assets so fewer companies would be easily insurable but at the same time, you can compensate for your losses by increasing rates across the board and making sure your swift payout gets a lot of press (driving business). It also wouldn't hurt revenue stream so investors would continue to receive (potentially smaller) payments.


No, a more apt analogy would be hacking a bank and moving money electronically. You find a hole and siphon $5-6 million to a counterpart in a territory where they aren't as stringent about personal identification. But good luck with InterPol.

IMO it's actually a bit strange that the so-called "Satoshi" chose secp256k1 without any clear reason given that the consortium that founded the group that published the paper isn't a stranger to the NSA...

The links you posted showed that thefts took place, not that the criminals were able to successfully launder them in the way you suggested: "No, that BTC will get split and moved to a thousand different wallets, and then moved randomly to thousands of other wallets, and then funnelled through a wash service where it gets mixed and split with other money. And then will get slowly traded for gold, goods, or just cash on LocalBitcoins. "
Can you provide an example of what you described? So far, on the money laundering front of known thefts:
Both cases suggest arrests. Not to mention the many thefts where the addresses have been dormant since the initial theft (even to date).

5-10 years, sure, and that's if it's not treated as a crime internationally. And statue of limitations isn't why many of these guys are sitting on their balance, one of the balances was tapped into within 2 years...


Of the process you suggested. I don't know of one case where even the first step of your hypothetical took place: "will get split and moved to a thousand different wallets, and then moved randomly to thousands of other wallets". All the major thefts are well-known, all I'm asking for is a link to BlockChain explorer with an address tied to a major theft where the crooks were smart or competent enough to even begin the process you described (splitting off to 1,000 wallets which ea sub-sequentially split off funds to 1,000 wallets).
Even if that can obfuscate the trail so it's no longer trivial, it's not literally possible to make BTC untrackable:
And even if it was somehow possible to mix than launder the money such that nobody could possibly know where it came from, the moment Billy Bob who earns 30k a year enters the Cayman Islands and leaves with 5 Million in undeclared assets, red lights still go off.
