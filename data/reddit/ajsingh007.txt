Hey OP - I think that these two articles could shed some insight
@_date: 2016-08-03 20:53:11
Apologies in advance but..
who in their right mind would ever place anything of value into Bitfinex in the first place? Did it use to be highly regarded, fast, or feature rich or something? I'm just like wtf
@_date: 2016-08-01 06:14:43
Some background -- after the 2007-08 global financial crisis, we saw the impact of both poor monetary policy and unethical practices in the mortgage/lending sector. Everyday citizens ended up covering the expense through their retirement funds or via taxes. Unfortunately, they basically paid or "bailed out" the institutions who caused the problem... which we're all supposed to trust, right? 
Anyway, one of the reasons Bitcoin was developed was to provide the everyday person an alternative means of storing value or transacting. There are two meaningful reasons for this -- one could be interpreted as attempting to prevent an additional crisis. Another would be taking some control over ones savings/earnings, which previously could not be done. You simply had to have faith and trust in the banking, metals, or monetary policy sectors. 
TLDR - It is supposed to prevent it man.

No bro... In the occasional instances of using my Shift card, I just debit from my BTC Wallet. Any other wallet I pair the card to has not worked for me to date
@_date: 2017-12-27 22:29:42
damn! I thought the discount Tuesdays were everywhere
@_date: 2017-12-27 04:35:15
shoot I don't even know bro, all I know is that it debited the correct amount from my wallet and I have my ticket. Recent purchases with this card include groceries and work clothes from the local mall
@_date: 2017-12-27 04:38:30
What I do know is that for some transactions (such as ATM withdrawals) Shift charges a fee, but your typical debits don't have any fee. Its been like that for a while, and I sure hope they keep it that way!
@_date: 2017-12-27 04:34:18
So the card debited $6.50 worth of BTC from my coinbase btc wallet over to Shift Payments, and I believe Shift Payments then credits Fandango on my behalf. I imagine they cover the cost in the meantime? Also, the card refuses to work unless you have a balance with the wallet you have linked...
I'm not sure how exactly the mechanism works bro, but it has been working like this since I got the card back in 2015
Honestly -- I feel like people won't believe me until they get the card and make a debit card style transaction themselves. So my best suggestion is to order a card and just try it my man
@_date: 2017-12-27 04:36:36
I got mine from here like years ago 
@_date: 2017-12-27 04:42:31
I'll take your word for it. Sounds like it makes sense.
@_date: 2017-12-27 04:32:46
Where I live, most Theatres in the area have $6 dollar movies on Tuesdays (back in the day it was $5), and there's a 50cent convenience fee if you purchase through the Fandango app
@_date: 2017-12-27 22:30:31
a $65 movie ticket! that would be crazy. 
Didn't even use it once, wow!

Where I live, most Theatres in the area have $6 dollar movies on Tuesdays (back in the day it was $5), and there's a 50cent convenience fee if you purchase through the Fandango app
Also, back in the day I received the card in about a week (7 days) from when I signed up online
@_date: 2017-12-27 09:45:00
how do you set it to withdraw from another wallet? I've only been able to set it to my regular btc wallet, but nothing other than that. It will just say I'll have a balance of $0 if I set it to anything other than my btc wallet.

I've been noticing what you have detailed in your article, and its been driving me crazy! The average person will simply glaze over and absorb mass media messages like a sponge. Really, its kind of sad. 
I just don't understand why those in our nation (I'm here in the US) don't embrace it now reap the economic benefits, rather than stupidly kicking it down. We're just hurting ourselves.

I feel that these events may be a distraction from the crisis between the US, Ukraine, and Russia. Why isn't it getting the mainstream attention it deserves? This is huge, the consequences may be dire. What if Russia follows through with its rebuttal to the west's sanctions and dumps the dollar? China would have no choice but to dump it too just to save themselves and the result would be absolutely catastrophic.
