Thank you for your answer. So, as I understand it, smaller blocks go with the Bitcoin-as-digital gold view which would lend itself to building things on top of the block chain?

Are you joking? I genuinely can't tell. I'm new to Bitcoin, I'm asking about what has been (I now know falsely thanks to u/Manticlops helpful comment) presented as a big issue, because I don't understand what the problem is. All I want is a simple answer. There's no need to try to bully me for being new to Bitcoin.

Well at least some people seem to be mature and willing to help newcomers &lt;3

Well, I hope it gives you satisfaction. I hope everyone in this community isn't this toxic - literally all I wanted was a simple explanation of the arguments that a relative newcomer could understand.

Ok. I understand it better now. Thank you very much for your time. :D

Why are people so riled up about it then? Also I'm not trying to troll anyone so sorry if it came off like that. I just want to know what it's all actually about.

That has nothing to do with the power of the Bitcoin network at the moment.
