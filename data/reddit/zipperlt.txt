Noticed you guys encouraging the reporting/attacking of a lot of big players in the past be it an exchange, developer, a company, a speaker, a wallet, doesn't matter. While accusing their actions or simply existence of being an attack on you? This is not ethical in my view.

They are off chain scaling solutions that "should" lower the fees.

They don't have access, their method and code for the hard fork will implement this artificially.

Short answer is yes. Somebody will say Lightning and Segwit in a sec tho.

A lot of people here think that there is an attack on Bitcoin, but those people attacking Coinbase, others are being misguided as pawns in this war of the Bitcoins.
Which one will win, because we all know it can not be stopped? The real Bitcoin can not be stopped because it is a decentralized system. The battle continues, don't get popcorn, do the research. 
Read the Bitcoin white paper, it is our responsability to understand how Bitcoin works.

Download a wallet, buy Bitcoin, send some to another wallet you created, watch transaction on the blockchain. Boom you know more about Bitcoin than some who read the books.

There used to be a website called [PaypalIsShit.com]( if I am not mistaken, but now it's gone. There were lots of horror stories posted. Whenever I am buying something and they ask money via paypal (classifieds and small workshops mostly) I suggest to send them bank tranfser instead, but they go, "no Paypal is OK". I guess not many people have been burnt yet..

Good information. This is the sort of analysis I come here for.

BSV chain mined a couple 128MB blocks today actually

Replace-By-Fee allows stuck transactions to be rebroadcasted by the wallet with a different fee. 
Without RBF, once a transaction is in the pool it's going to sit there until mined/signed into a block.

It appears to be at around 9% now 
Is it because people are transfering in order to claim the scammy Bitcoin Gold?

Of course, including Maduro and Dilma, now removed, watch shit going down in Brazil dik.

But there is no Leningrad region, perhaps they meant Kaliningrad?
Edit: Juts double checked, there is a region called Leningrad in Russia. My bad.

The above two facts you state are not interconnected. How about a well known fact that all hijackers were of a Saudi origin?

Essentially yes, it was Facebook driven. Somehow Pizzagate is not enough so start Western spring. Anyway in Libyas case, the first city to be hijacked by armed foreign merceneries was eithger Zawiya or Benghazi, where Gaddafi refused to bomb enemy due to them being embedded within civilian population. Gaddafi decided against his own and allied military advisors and lost. Bashar learnt the lesson it seems.

I have heard the accusation before (the very next day after attacks in fact) but haven't seen evidence to support it.
@_date: 2017-09-21 09:01:26
Got it!

You are a murderer for allowing the state to bomb people who elected those men to power according to their constitution. 
@_date: 2018-07-26 16:24:41
Afganistan = Constitutional monarchy, they operated within their own laws, there was much less suffering until people like you supported interference.
With Libya, country with a highest standard of life in African continent, western interference changed state from paradise to hell it is now.
Assad was recently reelected according to the constitution revised in 2012, but you still don't mind bombing those people.

Only crazy person would touch Bitcoin which isn't theirs. Blockchain keeps a record of every transfer. That's why there are many Silk Road wallets sitting untouched. Vendors realized they can be tracked if they cash out or buy something.
