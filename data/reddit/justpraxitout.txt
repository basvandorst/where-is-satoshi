Not only that, the author of the piece is clearly commenting on things he doesn't really understand.  Microsoft did not introduce a "Blockchain as a Service" offering as a part of Azure ... they're simply allowing 3rd parties to build marketplace templates (think of them as pre-built VM images) that have software already installed.  It's not a Microsoft developed/operated service ... they're only providing VMs.  There are hundreds (thousands?) of other software titles in the Azure marketplace as well...

That's still giving it too much credit.  [According to Visa's 10-K filing with the SEC]( the "big three" (Visa, Mastercard, American Express) do **$8.3 trillion dollars** in payments a year, on a volume of 148 billion transactions (that's 4,693 transactions per second, BTW).
*If* we believe some of [the charts over at Blockchain.info]( (big "if") BTC [has been averaging about 100,000 transactions per day so far this year]( ... representing [about $50m per day](
Multiply each of those by 365 ... and you get 36,500,000 transactions and $18.2 billion in USD volume.  That means that Bitcoin is doing 0.0247% of the transactions of the big three payment cards, and 0.2% of the dollar value.  And that is being *very generous* with the BTC numbers (assuming BCI is accurate) since there are transactions that are simply gambling/dice sites, people moving coins between wallets, etc. and since BitPay refuses to release any vendor transaction stats at all - we've no real way to be sure how much of the overall transaction volume is tied up in that.  Not to mention the fact that I'm using June 2015 transaction numbers for BTC, against ~~CY2014~~ 2013 transaction numbers for the big card processors.

Percentages - how do they work?
Yes, when you transact *small sums* of money, the "last mile" costs will end up being a larger percentage number of the transaction overall.  Last mile infrastructure has a lot of fixed costs -- for example: ATMs.  My nearest not-my-bank-ATM will let me take out $20 as a minimum.  For that, I pay a $3 charge.  ZOMG 15% ATM fee!

What "convenience"?  That's the part I struggle with in their business model here.  They want to embed some sort of asset value into my mobile device ... for what purpose?
If I want a subscription to the NYTimes online, I'll pay for one with my credit card - *it's really not that hard!*  If I want a new song that is streaming on iTunes Radio or Pandora, I can just hit "buy" on the iPhone screen and it's mine.  If I'm at Home Depot picking up a bag of screws, I just touch my iPhone or AppleWatch to their NFC payment terminal and I'm on my way.  If I'm Uber'ing ... I've already loaded my banking details up ... and I just walk out of the car when I hit my destination.
Those are, for the most part, very small transactions.  How am I helped - *significantly* - by having a cryptocurrency on my mobile device for any of this?   I mean, can it be done?  Sure - but if it's a convoluted mess that brings no additional value (i.e.: just look at CurrentC in the mobile payments/retail market for an example) ... what's the point?

The current network maxes out at a real-world value of roughly 2.7tps ... and mathematical maximum of I think 7tps.   Think about the quantity of devices * the quantity of satoshi's you're talking about here ... and the *existing bitcoin network* simply can not support it.
This leads me to believe that they may deploy their own blockchain.  It would be foolish to have a core function of your overall business plan resting 100% in the hands of anonymous entities, and that current dependency literally *can't* meet your business plan's goals as-is.

This is the main part.  While I've only glanced at some of this - there is nothing that I took away from what I read so far, which leads me to believe that what 21 Inc wants to accomplish would need to base itself off of the *current* Bitcoin blockchain (i.e.: the chain that starts with Satoshi's genesis block) for this.  In fact, it would give them far more future flexibility if they did *not* use the current Bitcoin infrastructure in case they needed to make changes in the future (just witness the arguments and angst over increasing the current block size, as an example) and just deployed their own blockchain.

I actually deal with PE's, VC's, and buy-side investment firms on a regular basis.  I've seen them (and advised them) on funding some really brilliant projects ... and I've seen them chase after some absolute shit (against my advice).

This is a slightly rosier picture than what was the VC mantra during the dotcom boom -- out of 10 companies, 5 would completely fail ... 2-3 would return original capital or maybe 1x extra on top of that ... and hopefully 1 or 2 were blockbusters.

I buy iTunes songs for $0.99 all the time.  I get a bill from Apple.  A $0.99 charge appears on my credit/debit card.
These are *not* impossible transactions with existing payment systems.


Currently Bitcoin transactions cost $8 per ... and that is *with* the mining subsidy in-place at a (still) high rate.  Either those transaction costs will increase as the mining subsidy continues to get cut in half, or the hashrate of the network necessarily goes down as miners unplug ... and then Bitcoin is more likely to be attacked.
@_date: 2015-05-19 13:28:41


*Exactly!*  Which is why I said above, "my nearest **not-my-bank-ATM**" which seems to have missed.
The larger point, however, is that you can make anything look bad when you compare fixed "last mile" costs with a very small transactional amount.  The last mile in any network is always the most expensive, and WU is no different in that regard - it takes a lot of overhead costs to secure piles of cash all around the world.  (who spams this sub regularly to pump his remittance service) is making a big deal out of a fixed transaction fee of $13 ([source here]( which - *conveniently* - applies to transactions of up to $50.  Would he - as the operator of a remittance service - possibly cherry-pick the absolute worst percentage?  Naaaahhhhh... 
But if you look at some of the other percentages on that same table ... if you send $500 the fee plummets to 7.4% ... and if you send $2,500 the fee plummets to 4%.  
That was my point with the ATMs example above ... the "last mile" in that network, is maintaining all of the ATM machines and the stacks of cash inside them - something that has a non-zero real-world cost.  But, if I only take $20 out of the not-my-bank-ATM ... my percentage 'fee' for doing so is huge - 15%.  If I take out a lot ($300) it plummets to 1%.
It's disingenuous math (intentionally so, IMO) ...

More importantly (and very relevant for the members of this subreddit)...


If a "21 BitShare" is 21 Inc's own blockchain network ... then this announcement today has no real benefit (financial, especially) to Bitcoin (the currency).
In fact, if they are releasing this type of embedded processing system - it would be reasonable to believe that they may want it to be on their own controlled network, if for no other reason than they may occasionally want to make a protocol change (and just look how long increasing the block size has been debated and put off).

What makes you think 21 Inc's plans here ... would necessarily utilize the current Bitcoin blockchain?  They could (and IMO, likely would) roll out their own blockchain for this - especially if they are looking to strike large partnership deals - because they will want the flexibility of making a change in the protocol in the future if needed.  Look at all the antics that have surrounded the debate of increasing the current Bitcoin block size...

These are two *completely different* arguments, that do not belong in the same sentence.  In some 3rd word/command-and-control economies where the state controls everything ... yes, I can see that no one has the right.
But in western democratic socieities?  Typically most anyone would have a 'right' to start one if they wanted to (assuming they were not a convicted felon).  Not having the *capital* to do so is a completely different argument.
Here's an example - what's another business that would require a *ton* of capital to start up?  An airline.  So your statement would effectively be like saying "Nobody has a 'right' to start an airline..." which is patently ridiculous.

That's not an uncommon time v. value tradeoff, however I would say it's not a perfect analogy because one of those values is fixed - you can *not* create more hours in a day, so if cycling 1 hour to the store and 1 hour back will exceed your budget of 24 hours in a day (once all other hours are factored in) you either have to find a faster mode of transportation which may have a larger cost ... or you have to shed hours somewhere else to make time.
So, [I asked this elsewhere]( ... what is more "convenient" about anything they are proposing?  Even if I spent an extra $180 in electricity and got $180 in Bitcoin or BitShares or whatever they will call it ... what is it *doing* for me - the average consumer - that:
* I can't otherwise do today...
* Is making it *dramatically* easier...
After all ... that's sort of been the mantra of Bitcoin entusiasts, hasn't it?I'm still just scratching my head on that - from a *payments/currency* perspective.  Authentication, however, there could be interesting use cases in what they are going after.

I actually view this as one of the reasons all of the "futures" market have popped up - with ridiculous 20:1 leveraging - as a way to extract much more cash, *above and beyond bitcoin itself* from West to East.
Think about it for a second.  Let's assume there is 1 block that has been mined, with a 100 BTC segniorage reward for doing so.  Further, let's assume that 1 BTC = $250, roughly what it is now.  The miner sells 1 BTC each to 100 interested investors, and generates $25,000 in income.  That's it.  The income for the miner has stopped ... until they can mine another block.
And they might mine another block, or another miner might get the next one.  But, if you want an *additional* income source, why not let clients *place bets on future price movements* as well.  Even better, if you - the miner - are in collusion with both the exchanges and the options markets (often one in the same) behind the scenes, and can trigger margin calls to bleed ~~suckers~~ customers from their cash slowly.

You could potentially look at it by taking all of Visa's revenue ... assume their only revenue is derived from 1-2% fees on the value transferred ... and do the math from there.

I'm of a mindset that it's better to spend your prime earning years in a higher-dollar market if you can.  If it's early in his career (early 20's) that's the perfect time to go.
Consider the example of two programmers that work from age 20-60 - one lives in SF and the other in Cleveland - and then both retire to Pensacola, FL.  It's highly likely that the progammer that worked 40 years in SF will have a notably larger nest-egg once he/she retires.

I wish more people would grasp this.  Yes, there are some penny stocks that eventually hit on X,000% gains - either justifiably or not.  The logical fallacy (even if it was a justifiable gain) is assuming that then of course it's inevitably going to happen *again* for that same investment instrument.  Buyers seem to forget that X,000% gains are much easier when you're dealing with smaller market cap numbers ... and just assume X,000% gains are coming again *eventually*.

I've always made the assumption that maybe there's $1-2bn worth of economic activity in the world, which may want to stay "off the radar" so to speak, for which something like BTC (for now) would be appealing.  But, this could be replaced by an altcoin at some point in the future if it offered better *features* to the users (most users for illicit purposes won't really give a shit about inflationary vs. deflationary, that's just what got the rabid AnCap's onboard initially).
If you divide that by the 14m or 21m coins ... you get about $70 to $100 per coin.  That's where I assume it's eventually headed (and no, I will *not* place a short position on that in an unregulated exchange in a foreign country which is quite likely front-running trades on their users or is otherwise just a bucket shop).

Highly unlikely.  Big corporations aren't that intellectually lazy with their corporate logos.  If I put a sign in the window of my car as an Uber driver ... and use the U of Uber, and incorporate a "F" before it ... and a "CK YOU" afterwards ... they won't just say "oh well, nothing we can do!"
If my Uber driver handed me this, he'd not only get zero tip (I typically do tip my Uber drivers), a 1.0 rating *and* an email to customer service specifically noting that he/she was soliciting tips.

Something tells me that an organization like Fidelity doesn't want their transactions determined by a bunch of shady unknown miners operating in ramshackle pseudo-datacenters in China.
Just because Bitcoin *can* run 100% trustless, does not mean that it *must* be run that way.  Fidelity (and several other banks/financial firms) could agree to a trusted network (kind of like SWIFT) of miners/nodes ... which carry an immutable ledger of transactions between the entities.  There would be no 51% hashpower attacks, because the network would be logically closed off (while packet transport could still run on the public Internet).

What else does this modified RaspberryPI do - allow people to "sell digital goods and services" (their words) directly via Bitcoins?  I thought Bitcoin already had that from day  - direct peer-to-peer transactions.

Trust can be a value.  It can be 0%, it can be 100%, it can be something inbetween.  For example:
* I trust a stranger walking down the street pretty close to 0%
* I trust my family members close to 95%
* I trust my close friends somewhere between 70-90%
etc. etc.
The Bitcoin model is 0% trust - it works for that.  But, there can be other scenarios in the world where less-than-full-100% trust may also exist ... where a blockchain could provide value.
According to SWIFT's statistics ... they have about 9,000 member banks in the world.  Do you think every single bank, is going to "vet" the other 8,999 globally to develop a 100% trust relationship with them?  No, of course not.
This is the prime failing, IMO, in the viewpoint of Bitcoin'ers.  Just because Bitcoin may have proved the value in a blockchain in a 0% trust scenario ... they therefore assume that *any and all uses of a blockchain are only valid in 0% trust situations*.  Personally, I just don't believe that to be true.  And neither do the VC's behind 21 Inc which just got a big chunk of cash - who have (reportedly) said that currency/store of value [is pointless](

You would have a trusted third party (some sort of consortium, perhaps like SWIFT) who would decide/maintain who the *participants* in the network would be ... but they would not be involved in any trust issues with *transactions* across that network.
If blockchains find their way into financial industries (it's possible), it will **not** be on the Bitcoin blockchain of 6,000+ anonymous ASIC miners in dodgy warehouses ... that need $1m of subsidy per day to run.
@_date: 2015-03-14 17:03:06


Trust is a spectrum, not a binary value.  There can be 0% trust (Bitcoin w/its blockchain has proved it can work in this scenario) and 100% trust, and values somewhere inbetween.  IMO, this is where the mindset of Bitcoin advocates is blinded by their investments ... they assume that because Bitcoin *can* work in a 0% trust scenario ... that therefore blockchains *are only applicable in 0% trust scenarios*.  I would disagree.

Poor analogy.  Uber and AirBnb *are* middle men.  Those businesses may not *own* capital assets, but their business depends on the *use* of the capital assets of others.
LendingClub is another good example - they do P2P lending, so that individual investors can lend funds out to people consolidating credit card debt, starting a business, whatever.  LendingClub just matches up the capital (investors) and with the borrowers ... and applies lending best practices to the handling of funds (risk analysis of borrowers, chasing down late bills via collections, etc.)   They take a "cut" of the %age ... but are effectively a "CapEx-lite" bank.

Well, yes and no.  To be clear, there are about 9,000 member banks on the SWIFT network.  If the financial companies had (years ago) decided to get together and say "Ok, we need something *better than* our current arcane FTP system ... because 'reasons'" they would have done a ROI analysis, and realized they could have never pulled it off.  Anyone who has ever been involved in a software engineering project, would likely realize this.
However, suddenly a new technology appears on the horizon - a 'blockchain' - and it's already pre-packaged in a semi-crude state and ready to go (and it's been thoroughly tested in its crude state) and suddenly the "I" portion of the "ROI" equation ... comes *way way down*.
Technically, could a centralized ledger system have been done globally with a room full of really really big Oracle RAC servers?  Sure.  Organizationally/logisitcally?  No ... never.

Ok ... but tell me, in regards to the scenario I posed above, do you believe that:
* SWIFT *vets* participants who will connect to their network, prior to letting them do so?
* SWIFT gets involved in transaction disputes *between member banks*?
That might help me frame it better, if I know what your working assumptions are for the current banking system of 9,000+ banks in 200+ countries.

Holy fuck, no ... we are not.  The most secured systems in all existence run on private networks [and end up causing scenarios like this when tampered with](  The most secured fiber optic lines can actually be run through PVC and then pressurized, so that any change in air pressure at all (i.e.: someone trying to tap in) can immediately be recognized by the network and the line gets instantly shutdown.
**That** is how highly-secure systems operate.  


Oh jesus christ, no it couldn't.  Right now the Bitcoin network has a *theortical* maximum of about 7 transactions per second, and a real-world maximum of about 2.7-3tps.

Yeah, but when you start hitting massive scale levels ... RDBMS systems really become a challenge.  That's why NoSQL systems (*eventually-consistent* instead of immediately-consistent) have gained significantly in popularity in the last several years.

"*A tamper-resistant ledger on an untrusted network*", I could agree with.
However, therein lines the problem -- big finance will not see an "untrusted network" as a benefit.  In fact, it's quite likely they will see it as just the opposite - an *unquantifiable* liability/risk.
All bitcoin'ers work themselves into a masturbatory frenzy about how it is distributed and peer-to-peer.  Some things perhaps should be (I find the concept of Namecoin interesting, although the current [root server system]( honestly works just fine) but that does not therefore imply that *all things need to be* or are even ideally suited to be.  Unless you're a rabid AnCap that hates everything.
P2P protocols like BitTorrent actually were interesting and useful, because they actually addressed a problem - lots of people trying to move *exceptionally large files around* (i.e.: mostly pirated movies) and choking off bandwidth points.  So it performed a very useful service - distributed bandwidth aggregation, and anonymity.  The use cases for keeping a ledger of money, is not the same use case as torrent'ing the latest Hollywood blockbuster, so I actually agree with the point that OP rages against - there could be blockchains without currency/store of value, and there is *zero* reason why those blockchains would need to be the current Bitcoin blockchain.

I disagree.  There is a world of difference between "trust in participating entities" and "trust in ledger accuracy".  SWIFT doesn't get in the business of dealing with squabbles between two member banks over some sort of transaction that traversed their network ... but you can bet your ass that SWIFT *vetted* each and every one of those banks out, before they let them join the SWIFT network.
The Bitcoin network solves for both of those trust scenarios, that's true.  But where your logic falls down is the *assumption* that both absolutely must be solved for banks to use it too.  I, and disagree.  The reality is -- a closed system is far closer to what the banks have been accustomed to working with for decades, so a "closed blockchain" network could be appealing.
@_date: 2015-03-14 16:29:49


You would be correct.  


Just because Bitcoin (or more specifically, a blockchain) *can* solve for trustless scenarios, does not necessarily mean that it must *only* solve for trustless scenario.
There's all sorts of blathering about on here about "well, if they trust each other they could all just use a centralized database!" but ... honestly ... these statements are likely coming from individuals who have never written a line of code in their life.  The actual *market reality* is ... that it has not evolved - it's actually much harder to do that, than people realize.  So what we're left with is [legacy/arcane FTP transfers, etc.]( that are involved in how ACH works, because it's "good enough".  The ROI on a complete global system ... likely would have never had enough justification to go beyond "good enough".  But suddenly a new technology appears on the horizon - a blockchain - all pre-packaged and ready to go ... and the "I" part of the "ROI" equation comes way down.
A private blockchain ledger - is basically that new "distributed database" (with centralized control/governance).  If you grasp that, you can quickly realize that there is a vast market opportunity for improvement on the "trusted ledger" part alone.  A blockchain without "Bitcoin".

Why it is low?  Serious question - I don't understand how the underlying investment instrument has anything to do with deferring some of your salary until some future date...
Put more simply, if you are paid $1,000 USD per week by your employer ... if you decide to "invest" 10% in your retirement you only have $900 cash that week.  Whether the $100 goes into a 401k that's holding ultra-conservative utility stocks, or $100 goes into BTC is *wholly irrelevant*.
The problem is, millennials are (too frequently) living paycheck-to-paycheck.  There's no room in the budget for retirement investing.  Somehow, you seem to think this is a "401k" problem, but it's not (especially considering that many employers *match* employees' 401k contributions ... which is basically free money).


Ah.  Now the motivation becomes clear...
@_date: 2015-03-16 01:32:49


To "just get through the firewall" *really* oversimplifies it.  There are plenty of transactional networks in the world that are **not** riding over the Internet - so first, you'd need to get actual physical access to a network connection somewhere.  Furthermore, the protocol could be modified so that new nodes appearing on the network would not be able to transact for a defined period (a few weeks, a month) so that some rogue node popping up .. can't suddently make a transaction.  And you'd have to forge a transactional message from a bank with funds ... to "First Bank of ... in order to hope to have a chance to get any money.


Bitcoin is an utter waste of resources, period.  A private blockchain would be no different than Bitcoin, it would just be a "closed membership" system ... instead of Bitcoin, where literally anyone can download the code and start running a node.   Bitcoin'ers seem to assume that is a benefit that high-finance markets would appreciate ... but, in reality ... it's a liability.
@_date: 2015-03-13 22:24:00


Network firewalls.  Kinda simple, really.  If SWIFT, for example, decided to use a blockchain - they would maintain the list of approved devices on the SWIFT network.  You wouldn't just allow anyone out there to add one.  That is something that Bitcoin'ers seem to *assume* would be the case (because it's how it works for Bitcoin) ... but in financial markets, really ... it wouldn't.
Or, as below me noted, you can also require server- *and* client-side certificates for communications ... issued from a central governing body (again, it could be SWIFT).

Wait, what does that mean exactly?  Is it ... like ... *day*trading losses, i.e.: they were trying to be all Ethereum was supposed to be a company/product/technology --- not a mutual fund.
