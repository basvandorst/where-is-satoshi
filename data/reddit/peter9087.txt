Thank you!

Dammit, I´m always too late for these kind of things.
@_date: 2014-06-01 06:59:27
Thank you for sharing your story. I agree with you that bitcoin is much more than a way to make money. I firmly believe that it is the currency of the future. And as our technology evolves I think we are heading to more decentralized society and I think bitcoin is just the first step.

It´s people like you that have made bitcoin what it is today and for that I salute you sir.
@_date: 2014-06-01 07:02:43
That´s a good way to put it.
@_date: 2014-04-25 10:20:17
Okay thanks for the fast answer
@_date: 2014-12-05 17:39:34
Okay i´ll do that.
@_date: 2014-05-30 18:13:25
Yep, I have zero experience with Linux
@_date: 2014-05-30 13:04:49
Wow thank you! This is the biggest tip I´ve ever gotten.
@_date: 2014-05-08 15:37:47
Thank you, this system is so cool
@_date: 2014-05-30 20:46:19
I will actually build it myself. Only bought the parts.
@_date: 2014-05-31 21:27:44
Great story, I can't imagine the stress you'd gone through from all the bubbles and crashes. Impresive that you haven't cashed out yet and it shows you are a true beliver in bitcoin. Thank you.
@_date: 2014-05-31 19:05:29
Thank you!

It seems most people just mined it in the begining because it was just to hard to trade it.

He is spreading bitcoin and educating people about it. Introducing it to new people. The only way bitcoin will grow is if more people start using it.

Well, the Swedish Krona has increased significally in relation to Euro over the past years.
@_date: 2014-05-08 11:40:31
I´ve never been tiped before
@_date: 2014-05-31 17:42:09
That´s awesome! Happy it worked out for you.
@_date: 2014-05-31 07:44:51
Is there a site where you can keep record of how much you bitcoins have gone up/down. Like you say how much and at what price you bought the bitcoins? 
@_date: 2014-05-31 18:46:54
Glad to hear that!
@_date: 2014-05-31 19:43:42
Thank you for sharing your story, it really put a smile on my face.
@_date: 2014-05-31 19:48:44
Interesting I newer knew how hard it was to actually buy bitcoins back then. It´s awesome that you now can live off of bitcoin. I'm happy for you.
@_date: 2014-06-01 17:04:00
Let´s hope so.

Fascinating story. I'm glad you´re able to feed yourself now and I hope you sort out your pesonal life too. Money is great and all and it can certainly help you on your way to happiness, but in end it´s family and frends that makes you happy. 
Best of luck friend!
@_date: 2014-05-31 17:15:28
That´s a good question. When I think of an early adopter I imagine a person that has gotten rich on it or could have if him/her didn´t sell off their bitcoin. It really depends on how much you invested and not only on the price. 
But for some kind of refrens point, let´s say 10$.
@_date: 2014-05-09 18:41:24
Thank you sir!
@_date: 2014-05-30 22:18:52
I have been buying bitcoins every week for the past 3 months in purpose of saving up to a computer and with reson value increase made me able to buy it earlier than expected. I will keep buying bitcoins though, for long term savings.
@_date: 2014-05-08 15:49:58
I could go for some bits :)

Me: Hey Grandma have you heard about bitcon?
Grandma: No what´s that?
Me: It´s like money but on the internet.
Grandma: What´s the internet?
Me: Nevermind, can I have some more pie please.

It feels like many of the "early miners" that manage to hold on to their coins were miners and didn´t really have a way to spend it. That´s maybe the only way to keep your cool and don´t cash out through all the crashes and bubbles. 
@_date: 2014-05-09 16:49:49
I believe this is one of the best way to expand the bitcoin community. So try to tip on other subreddits  and on twitter.
Spread the word, spread the love!

It is a swedish store. Not sure if they have internationally shipping though.
@_date: 2014-05-08 14:29:08
wow thank you. This is really amazing and a great way to spread bitcoin!
@_date: 2014-06-01 06:43:20
Damn, that´s a shame. Have you since then bought more bitcoins or did you stop completly?
@_date: 2014-05-30 16:57:17
Yeah I see how you can make that assumption. Should´ve probalbly wrote something like: I just bought a computer **using** bitcoin and it felt awesome!
@_date: 2014-05-30 18:50:09
Does changetip work on facebook now?
@_date: 2014-06-01 17:16:38
I´m just glad Sweden voted no to the Euro. Really dodged a bullet there.

Thank you for the story. I like have you kept your feet on the ground and didn't get crazy as many people that get a large some of money do (celeberties/lotto winner). I wish you the best of luck in the future.

So many people lost bitcoin at MtGox and it makes me sad every time I hear about it. Hope you have better luck in the future
@_date: 2014-05-31 19:53:59
Strong of you to manage to hold on to your bitcoin through up and downs.
@_date: 2014-04-25 13:16:24
Thanks for all the help. I decided to use the swedish site  to buy my bitcoins.
@_date: 2015-02-03 20:28:39
Yes, I am not too late!
