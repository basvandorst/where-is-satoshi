Well, a Bitcoin is backed by being able to put stuff on the blockchain. You can exchange bitcoin for the inclusion of a valid command in the next block. It's not so trivial. In fact, it's what makes coloured coins possible.

You'd be a fool not to store your bitcoin with Paypal. They are, after all, the largest online payment provider, and they have more than adequate security and insurance for your funds to be safe. Yes, you'll get the whole AML/KYC treatment, but that won't be so different from Coinbase or Blockchain. If Paypal produced a crypto wallet, I would store my coins there without hesitation. They have the technology.

Bitcoin is a dangerous technology with the potential to liberate the anarchic forces of nature that mankind has so long fought to suppress in the struggle to defend the weak and protect the poor. Bitcoin will accelerate natural selection and encourage the dictatorship of the market, money as king of the world. This is the economic singularity. What will it be like? It will be a massive leap for mankind, blood will be shed, massive poverty will sweep the earth as republics collapse and corporations raise their skyscrapers to the sky. Don't forget the first AIs aiming to manage resource consumption. Capitalism and socialism will converge into a new hyper economy where poverty will disappear along with privilege, the leveling of society into a new single proletariat defining the economy through decentralised financial engineering. Somebody else pick up from here.

Any idea why they are doing that? Is it a deliberate act to try to manipulate scarcity of confirmations? Is it optimising something else?

Let's go through what could cause this besides a computer glitch.
Perhaps the Bitcoin wiki page was linked to in a memo that circulated among a bunch of employees/members of a mailing list?
Or, it was linked to on some very popular website or blog.
It just seems very out of boundaries. It shouldn't be too hard to find out.

You can just tell Bitcoin is the word on everybody's lips. Crypto has set the world of money on fire.
Still, Mobile Monday is a pale echo of Tipping Tuesday. Also, there will be fees disguised in there somewhere, for example, to put money into your account or to withdraw funds.
The battle is only starting and already Bitcoin is leading. This ad is trailing behind Bitcoin and trying to capture its spirit. Crypto-currencies are defining the game and it's only a matter of time before the market forces centralised monetary systems to take a step back.

peer to peer system could be other scarce resources, relatively easy to

data storage. These resources would make a limited peer to peer money

This should not apply to companies genuinely just wanting to answer questions and concerns in the quickest way possible.
It would be like saying you can't have a bot that watches Twitter for mentions of your username or service and alerts you when a set of keywords comes up. Obviously the benefits of allowing such a mechanism far outweighs the problem with brigading scenarios.
Yes organised/paid/astroturf brigading is bad and should be fought, but please don't throw the baby out with the bathwater.

It's still too weird... In a few posts, x paints the perfect picture of Bitcoin, an invention that would only see the day 6 years later.

We could in fact go nuclear on this.
Start a dedicated subreddit where people post ads, campaign ideas, etc... in a [permanent revolution](  sort of way.
@_date: 2014-11-24 19:27:20
Security is also affected.
Signing a transaction broadcasts information that an attacker can use to reduce the search space he needs to explore in order to brute force a private key linked to a public key that has been used to send bitcoin in the past.
It might not be enough to actually crack Bitcoin as the computing necessary to search that space is still too high for humanity to attain, but it's still a security issue.
Can anybody with more knowledge of the issue comment on this?
