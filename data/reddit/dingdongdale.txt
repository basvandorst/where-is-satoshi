This is bullshit. Why do people post random hype that can't be backed? This hurts the page

You're a piece of shit if you take the time to tell someone they deserve it when they were just asking for some help. Too petty to spend your day focusing on yourself instead of shitting on others?

I get what you're saying! I just put "real dollars" in the title because usually people post about losing money tied to bitcoin, or an x amount of dollars in bitcoin. I just meant to say cash tho. Thanks! Happy new year too!

I find it refreshing that someone is being realistic instead of only listing the positive sides. So many people on this sub just hype each other up to the point of speaking nonsense. He’s not telling you his plans, all he’s saying is we’re entering another phase of bitcoin, and MOST of the people on here don’t really have a set plan for it at all.

Although I see where you’re going with that, aren’t newcomers necessary for growth??
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:47:10
very true, I should have just chilled out lol. But I guess its a learning experience. Eventually the fees will be low all the time too.

you can move small amounts (or any amounts) for free if you transfer it to gdax and then send to any address. You dont have to wait to build up the dollar amount.

I sure hope so man. Hearing all these dream forecasts of the near future makes me so pumped
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:37:08
Makes sense. I just gotta make use of gdax and slowly dollar cost average until I’m a medium fry;)
