My PC with a specialized virus couldn't upload malware firmware to my trezor?

But isn't it true that if you had done the opposite trade you would have made more money?  Or am I misunderstanding something?
@_date: 2016-06-23 23:09:48
Thanks. I didn't know that. 
@_date: 2017-08-28 13:54:05
Isn't it true that that trade would have made money at almost any point since the inception of bch?

We have all lived during times without large scale wars.... Not just talking about WW2 and Vietnam - governments have been doing this for millennia:

Inflation of the dollar is frequently caused by our government ‘s wars. You could also say it allows our government to fund their wars

It's like 90% of society claims "rock paper scissors is greater than video gaming"
We have more in solidarity with the gold bar investors than we do with the central bankers
@_date: 2019-06-20 05:27:00
the scales on that graph are a crime against humanity

Did you ever consider large bug screens surrounding it all?

So this is just the silicon valley buddy list?
I guess gab / dissenter / bitchute will still be banned from this kind of 'private club'
It seems like a "world of warcraft gold" - where the points are held exclusively on Mark Zuckerberg's game server
The fact that there is a need for this, highlights that the current vast amount of restrictions on money transfers inhibits business growth.

Indians have always had doubts (rightfully so) about the Rupee.  They are famous for preferring more stable methods of storage like gold.

You have a choice of only two presidential candidates. 
The other one thought women were punished too harshly in our justice system and that women are the main victims in war. 
Pick your set of delusions
@_date: 2019-12-07 13:15:19
Interesting take.  Perhaps we need to make sure that all countries have access to sound money and so all the world's governments have their power to wage wars reduced equally.
