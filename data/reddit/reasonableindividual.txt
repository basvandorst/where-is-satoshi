Just set a remindme and come tell me when I'm wrong, I'll be waiting... eternally
@_date: 2017-02-06 23:50:12
Now you included the word estimated, and that was the difference.  
Not only that, but what happens when, soon enough, 2mb blocks are full?   Pushing all but the largest of transactions off onto fee-based sidechains is the antithesis of Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-02-11 15:10:48
Don't even worry about it.. there is zero chance it gets 95% support, quote me on that.

We just need to make sure both sides are allowed to speak freely..
@_date: 2017-02-24 01:47:30
I hear that.  I've saved over 700 dollars in the time I've been using it, it's huge.  Especially now that my baby requires special brand formula (Alimentum) due to allergies.  A one week supply or so costs me about 150 bucks (insurance no longer covers it w/ prescription).  I'm a teacher and with my wife as a stay at home mom, every dollar counts.  At least by buying on Purse I can save up to almost 20% on every order.  I always tell everyone I know they need to be using Purse if they shop on Amazon.

Nodes don't represent users.  I could run a thousand nodes if I wanted to.

Very important point.

Nah, I sold a lot at 1000, held onto a good amount all the way down to the great 100ish crash of Bitfinex... held it all the way up.. 
COME OUT MY BROTHERS
@_date: 2017-02-11 15:09:33
Totally... my hope is Core realizes they cannot now move the activation % below 95%.  So, SegWit for all intents and purposes may be dead... there is 0 chance it get's to 95%, because 95% of the community and miners are NOT in support of one side.  
@_date: 2017-02-24 01:54:01
What about in countries where you can't get Bitcoin easily?
@_date: 2017-02-06 23:01:01
It doesn't double capacity, that's disingenuous.   Even then, it brings along a bunch of other code and 'fixes'  that a large portion of the network doesn't want.  If people wanted it, it would have already been activated. 
@_date: 2017-02-11 17:42:55
Yeah lol
@_date: 2017-02-08 13:01:30
We've had promises from Core before that were never honored.  I think everyone is in for a rude awakening.  There is 0% (quote me) chance of Segwit activating at the agreed consensus unless a hard fork is also implemented.
@_date: 2017-02-01 01:14:18
Awesome, thanks.   What happens post expiration?  Is it dead, or do they re evaluate? 
@_date: 2017-02-06 17:08:18
You say it's being held back by miners, but there is a hard fork option being held back by developers. 
It's time to compromise, and segwit by itself was never a compromise.  
@_date: 2017-02-08 12:57:15
Why do you claim segwit fork is well-supported?  Wouldn't that be activated if that was the case?  Just curious.
Also it's very disingenuous for you to try and link the ETF to the big block supporters.  If the ETF fails and they cite the potential of a fork, that is equally Core developer's fault just as much as it would be the big block supporters.  There needs to be compromise, and segwit wasn't compromise.
So let's compromise and take incremental steps.  Activate both segwit AND a block size increase ON TOP of the 1.7 or whatever segwit will bring.
@_date: 2017-03-17 15:15:07
That's exactly what I'm saying.  Sure, maybe the 2mb increase on top of Segwit seems silly to some, and maybe introduces some vulnerabilities that need to be addressed. 
But it's obviously needed to get this done.  And we have the best and brightest working on Bitcoin - so lets fix the vulnerabilities and make this work.  
@_date: 2017-03-17 16:51:19
A large part of the issue is much if the community wants on chain scaling, not side chains (we support side chains but don't want them to be the only way to buy stuff and shop, for example) .  I don't want to have to pay someone to use their side chain.  If we push Segwit through, and it turns out we still need more help scaling, I don't believe there would be incentive for core devs to make it on chain as opposed to side chain.  And that's a large problem for a lot of us.  We don't want to create opportunities for people to, more or less, tax us for using their side chains.  We want the same transaction fee negotiation with the miners we have been doing since the beginning. 
If there was some way to get a concrete promise for ON Chain scaling, after Segwit, as needed, so that the promise simply could not be abandoned, I think most of the community supporting bigger blocks would be behind that.  However, lots of these hard fork proposals are for years from now, which is beyond silly considering the pressing circumstances.  
@_date: 2017-03-12 15:30:51
I wouldn't be so sure.  I would put good money on devs changing the threshold for activation in order to shove it down everyone's throats. 
@_date: 2017-03-02 12:59:16
This explains why Blockstream will stop at nothing to ensure Segwit goes and a hard fork doesn't; you confirm their business model - fee based side chains.
@_date: 2017-03-12 20:58:11
May just be getting down voted for reveling in other's misery.  Anyone who traded long enough has great losses along with great gains.  No need to be a Dick.

Never will happen. 
@_date: 2017-03-08 12:36:04
It's a shame the most vocal ones engage in the debate; it seems that's all they care to do anymore - post on reddit and argue with Bitcoiners.
@_date: 2017-03-17 15:13:04
Part of the reason I want a compromise is because I know the core devs are the best devs to take us forward from a technical standpoint.  That's why I am calling for a compromise.  But, both sides have made major mistakes, and that includes core devs.  We need both sides to stop pretending to be infallible. 
@_date: 2017-03-22 22:59:04
Did I write in that post that this is what is happening? No.  I said people are upset about the comparisons being drawn.  I even said nothing to write home about.  So, maybe stop being so defensive?  Or wait, "find a new narrative." 
So welcoming, it's surprising isn't more well loved.
@_date: 2017-03-22 16:25:46
People are just upset that there are comparisons being drawn between the censorship of the US media and anything pro-Trump, and the censorship of anything pro big block in here.  Nothing really to write home about..
@_date: 2017-03-22 21:50:12
They already did offer a hard fork at the Hong Kong meeting.. But never followed through.  
@_date: 2017-03-17 14:27:43
You're definitely welcome to your opinion, but this is the type of comment that has continued to fracture the community and turn people defensive.  This only adds to make one half of the community despise the other, which impedes progress for all.  If you think you 'don't need' the BU supporters, you're just as wrong as if you assume we don't need the core supporters. 
@_date: 2017-03-10 13:05:23
'start'... I like how this is being marketed as' improved fees' Lmao 
@_date: 2017-03-22 23:46:44
All good, appreciate it. I apologize for being a Dick in my response. 
@_date: 2017-03-17 16:25:56
Roger could very well not exist and Segwit still won't activate.  It's a problem with how core devs and Segwit are viewed by half of the community that stops people from pushing Segwit, not because anyone cares what Roger says. 
@_date: 2017-03-12 17:54:13
It's the fault of the devs who made up this new consensus idea.. Then they were forced to stick with it since they pushed it on Classic and Unlimited.  And now they see it is impossible.  That's called making your bed and laying in it. 
@_date: 2017-03-17 16:14:15
The problem is we've also been told in the past a hard fork is in play, at the Hong Kong meeting.  The end result of that was broken promises.  The issue is, what incentive do core developers have to uphold their part of the bargain if half of the community gives in with nothing upfront? 
@_date: 2017-03-13 15:13:28
Wooweee the butthurt is real here.. Man will people be in for a surprise when Bitcoin unlimited forks and takes all the hash power (along with the value) and the north core-reans are left with mighty big bags. 
@_date: 2017-03-17 15:17:21
That's the same feeling half the community has towards the core developers.  Unfortunately, we all need to work past it. 
@_date: 2017-03-21 22:15:16
The fact that the whitepaper is no longer being treated as a 'constitution' of sorts goes to show everyone how far we have fallen as a community.
@_date: 2017-03-22 16:13:56
'legendary coder'...
@_date: 2017-03-19 18:43:06
Would prefer to have a neutral explanation to be honest 
@_date: 2017-03-12 15:34:36
You're joking right? Don't tell me you are seriously claiming 95% support and ALSO pointing to a Luke Jr web page as a source for facts that support luke Jr's business interests.  
If any of this was REMOTELY true, it'd be activated. It's not, so it won't, and it never will be unless devs as a whole change the activation threshold, which is exactly what I see them doing. 
@_date: 2017-03-19 15:34:20
sounds like everything  negative said about HFs then was just to push a certain agenda, got it
@_date: 2017-03-17 17:14:23
Side chains are an awesome idea.  But they aren't, and shouldn't be, the end all.  Why pay fees to use side chains on top of miner fees when we can just pay miner fees?  Side chains have great use cases but they aren't the only way smaller Bitcoin Transactions should be sent.  I shop on purse.io on an almost daily basis, and I don't feel I need another middleman skimming money off of the top for me to use their 'side chain.' 
That's very much how a large portion of the Bitcoin community feels, and it's not something objectively right or wrong.  So, knowing how core developers by and large feel about on chain scaling (and, at the very least, the appearance of a conflict of interest with blockstreams entire business model) makes it not such a huge leap to think that if they get Segwit pushed through without having to compromise on their end, that we may never see more on Chain scaling ever again.   So the whole thing is pretty simple, really.. There is a lack of trust.  The whole point of my post was to reach some compromise to instill trust once again. 
@_date: 2017-03-12 20:56:57
What does that prove lol 
@_date: 2017-03-17 15:10:45
Many, if not most, on both sides, I'd like to thing have educated themselves on the situation.  I sure have.  I'm not asking for Segwits 1.7mb increase.  A compromise would include an increase on top of that, of what I was saying was unclear. 
Anyway, I think an increase in threads calling for compromise is a good thing and signals a shift in the community at large.  We should be supporting more of these to be honest, instead of trying to lessen them. 
@_date: 2017-03-19 14:54:54
Wait, so now we are supporting hard forks?  
@_date: 2017-03-19 15:00:40
Yeah I get it, but all of the devs have continually been talking about how dangerous a hard fork is in light of the blocksize debate.  So obviously we shouldn't even consider that.
@_date: 2017-03-19 00:58:50
Guess that's the only way to run a successful company guys, wrap it up.
@_date: 2017-03-08 13:59:22
Yup, still a shame though. 
@_date: 2017-03-17 19:29:13
Don't you have to pay to open lightning channels?  In effect that's similar to a normal sidechain, then. 
@_date: 2017-03-17 16:29:18
It is.  If I make a Purse.io purchase for  .03 Bitcoin, I immediately buy back   .03 Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-03-19 15:49:17
Any hard fork dealing with block size is contentious 
@_date: 2017-03-19 19:41:50
LOL.... now that's a threat more than BU could ever present
@_date: 2017-03-19 19:41:12
So you are really going to blame Jihan for the opposition's decision to change code central to what makes Bitcoin, Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-03-19 15:23:21
Well then, if all of a sudden hard forks are okay to the core devs, that may make the other side much more appealing now too since much of the danger was inherent to a hard fork by itself... so they've said.
@_date: 2017-03-22 21:51:21
How so 
@_date: 2017-01-27 15:41:14
This guy also pushed agendas such as tracking coins and put religious text inside his code, come on lol.
