Thanks for being generous!

Even if this IS real, I doubt I'll use the PayPal BTC wallet unless they can sweeten the deal A LOT; I'd rather use wallet software made by a regular developer than a whole financial business.

true...thanks for the comment.

I invested $200 in their Hashlet program...worst decision I ever made. Sold everything and got $130 out of it after everything was sold+mining profits over the last 2 weeks.

&lt;sarcasm&gt;At least USD has an insurance section, in case your miner burns down your house or something.&lt;/sarcasm&gt;

I tried showing this to users on hash talk. They were all stubborn except for 2 users that PM'd me directly and talked about their experiences. I would post what they said, but then my account was banned.
You gotta love Gaw!

I sold everything on their hashlet program. I'm only buying from them once more, because they are selling out all of their mining hardware to make room for hashlets. They make good hardware, but I hate hashlets and hash talk to the ends of the earth.

WHOEVER JUST GVE ME REDDIT GOLD YOU ARE AWESOME! THANK YOU!

As long as you don't lose the wallet or its destroyed, then yes.
So, have multiple copies on multiple platforms. Copy the private and public key onto a text document and keep it on an encrypted flash drive.

lol I went into Krispy Kreme yesterday and walked out with a dozen donuts. There was a line out and around the building. 
Don't you just love mooching off society? :D

The price went up quite a bit too just after this was announced and I just kind of sat there watching my BTC ticket thinking "whaaaaat?"
@_date: 2014-06-02 14:31:38
Thanks kind shibe- I mean...BitCoiner...

Satoshi himself denied being Dorian Nakamoto after the report.
...newsweek so newsweek...

I laughed so hard the first time I saw this. And I was in the middle of sipping my coffee when I clicked the link.
@_date: 2015-05-22 21:29:06
Would anyone be up for this? Its just an idea at this point but let me know if you're interested. :)
@_date: 2015-05-18 01:34:33
Very wow
@_date: 2014-09-23 14:51:56
It'd be amazing if Valve started accepting BTC officially.
@_date: 2015-05-18 01:40:03
I attempted creating this a year ago. It went about as well as the name of the coin. 
@_date: 2014-09-24 15:06:41
I'm just getting into mining. Time to take a step away from some altcoins and go for the original :D

There was a DogeCoin tip feature for text messages at one point, but I think it was taken down because nobody knew about it. But popularizing BitCoin off of something like that would definitely bring attention. Good suggestion!
@_date: 2015-04-24 01:40:00
It sounds kind of ridiculous. Which is a good thing! However, instead of just one pot you should multiple to allow users to actually have a chance at winning. With one pot as it gained popularity it would basically become @_date: 2015-09-07 16:03:20

Thanks Satoshi ;)
@_date: 2015-10-13 23:38:34
I believe so. Paycoin was obviously a scam to begin with. 
@_date: 2015-10-13 22:27:21
$0.00. ;)
