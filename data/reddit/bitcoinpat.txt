The only thing missing from the article is the discussion of Bitcoin as a money transmission vs. Bitcoin as a store of value.  As A. Antonopolous always says "Bitcoin works just as well at $50 as it does at $500"
While this is true in a sense, what works well depends upon local factors as some people may need to store their wealth in Bitcoin because they have no alternative.  Others will not store their wealth in Bitcoin and simply use it for cash-in/cash-out.
This is the often used argument by banks and skeptics, that "Bitcoin is too volatile"
Is decentralization of Bitcoin diametrically opposed to price stability? Curious.
What's your take on this?
@_date: 2015-04-17 19:13:46
I'm familiar with the difference.  I am not talking about XRP, I am talking about IOUs.
*XRP is not a part of the Ripple network*
This is blatantly false.  The most heavily traded pairs on the Ripple network are XRP pairs.  XRP/USD, XRP/BTC, etc.  Every transaction involves spending XRP.  XRP is very much a part of the Ripple network and the network **could not** exist without XRP

Don't listen to the naysayers.  You are adding a ton of value and legitimacy to the Bitcoin blockchain.  It's truly remarkable that someone would be upset about a service that will be leveraging the Bitcoin network.  As for the crowdsale.  I hope that Factom does not take the Ripple Labs approach and give-away billions of tokens to their friends while simultaneously selling them to others
@_date: 2015-04-11 21:16:57
Surely you jest...
@_date: 2015-04-13 23:10:34
I agree with everything you are saying here.
@_date: 2015-04-15 03:07:54
I think that India will go nuts for Bitcoin once the bug starts... if there is even a fraction of China's volume coming from India, the price will stabilize nicely

The problem with that model of converting 1 bitstampUSD to one bitUSD is that there could be more people holding bitUSD than is possible to be liquidated through gateways.
That's why Ripple signs each USD.bitstamp or USD.snapswap and gives you the option of trusting another USD issuer at your choice.  
Regardless, you are still at the mercy of gateways being able to liquidate your IOUs
@_date: 2015-04-17 19:08:58
In some ways, yes.  
@_date: 2015-04-13 02:53:03
Muy bien!!! Gracias señores
@_date: 2015-04-17 19:05:58
Interesting.  Collateralized IOUs, gold or USD?  Somewhere you need a third party acting as an escrow or you have an issuer of those securities that must be trusted.

Good question... I have a feeling that Puerto Rico is off limits due to it's status as a US protectorate... at least for the time being.

Thanks for your reply Paul.
I think that people are so sensitive and leery due to all of the scams in this sector that many have become jaded and close-minded to new projects and new ideas.  Your patience and politeness in discussing concerns with vindictive commentators is commendable. 
I just want to say I really like the concept of Factom - especially the transparent and decentralized nature of how it works.  I am so fascinated to see what Factom will bring.
I wish Factom team best luck and a prosperous future.
@_date: 2015-04-17 19:07:13
That's actually not how it works.  IOUs are issued with a signature, so if you own USD on the Ripple network, you actually own USD.bitstamp or USD.snapswap
The problem is that these are central points of failure.  If Bitstamp or Snapswap goes out of business, you very well may have worthless IOUs that nobody will accept and cannot be redeemed.
@_date: 2015-04-02 23:28:27
Yeah, I've noticed his extremely bad grammar and spelling as well.  Apparently, it's not holding him back.  He was doing pretty well up until Paycoin... it's pretty painful watching him try to salvage the Titanic

Thanks for your reply.  I think this is the best route, and I know you guys are using Factom to build transparency into the exchange.  I'm looking forward to seeing your method.
@_date: 2015-04-13 23:22:01
Centralized blockchains don't require mining at all (ie Ripple).  They are inherently insecure from the beginning, so there's nothing that mining will do to make it more secure.  In the case of Ripple, the incentive for security falls on the company that is building it's business on top of the network.  In fact, since they are dealing in IOUs, they don't really need to secure the ledger.  The ledger is just a public snapshot of assets that are not stored on the blockchain at all, they are just a bunch of IOUs.  So if the ledger goes down, they should have a snapshot of all their customer accounts and balances.
The XRP are inherently insecure because they can be diluted (adding more resolution - more zeros .000000000000) to make more units of accounting.
In the end, all this hub-a-lub over blockchain tech "IoT" just really boils down to stamping a Public Key onto devices

Ethereum is not even released and Ether is not trading on the market, so how can you honestly say that the value has depreciated massively?  You made this up.
@_date: 2015-04-13 18:39:36
At least as far as currency, that's true.  That incentive is what has allowed the network to propagate organically.
It's very difficult for a currency network to propagate naturally without the financial incentive for people to be involved on a grassroots level.  It all started with the Bitcoin mining incentive.
IBM and Samsung are probably looking to capture a very different market - by building products and programming them to interface with a decentralized blockchain for the "Internet-of-Things".  
A certain amount of value will be assigned to this network but it's probably not possible to achieve true decentralization without the grassroots incentive of mining.
Satoshi was very wise to craft the protocol in the way it was crafted.
@_date: 2015-04-17 19:02:59
Thanks.  That's a good correction - I thought about that later.  
Good response, my point is basically that it's unnecessary to have transparency when the issuer of the IOU can fake their assets anyways.
@_date: 2015-04-17 19:08:23
this is hardly clickbait, I articulated my point and wanted to hear feedback.

Aww fuck my tooth hurts, I knew I should have bought XRY instead of XPY

Dude, do you really expect these guys to wait to release this until Bitcoin has been hardforked?  WTF ??
@_date: 2015-03-25 16:12:37
Okay you brought up a great point, that the communication between Cryptsy and the customer was bad.
At least here to talk to you and resolve the issue.  You won't get that from most altcoin exchanges
@_date: 2015-03-23 16:44:38
I agree, it's a short-term scheme to bring "confidence"
This confidence lasted about 48 hours until people realized this is just another pump and dump scheme.
By the way, I want to thank Josh Garza and Paycoiners for the usual XPY pump - I was able to make a small profit trading XPY on this hype.  
Never hold your money in altcoins - ever.
@_date: 2015-03-28 01:23:08
Interesting, sounds like he doesn't really understand the benefits of Bitcoin vs. Ripple, Stellar, Ethereum...
There's a big value in Bitcoin vs. centralized Gateway-based fiat currencies
@_date: 2015-03-29 22:08:40
I agree totally, this discussion illustrates the type of discussion that are had with taxpayer money.  I guess nobody had a laptop with Google on it to see what they could buy with Bitcoin.
It was certainly a pathetic attempt discuss Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies... but at least they are open to it and at least the professor is bullish
@_date: 2015-03-30 03:47:29
Great news...
I thought this part was funny though:
If you're a resident of one of the following countries, you will be restricted from accessing Bitt services.
North Korea
United States
@_date: 2015-03-23 02:18:00
I signed up for the invite like a week ago when it first launched just to see if it's actually possible to use this service... nothing...
I don't know if Josh Garza will ever pull this paycoin thing off, but it doesn't really matter because the fact remains we don't need paycoin or any altcoin to make digital payments.  
You can do it with Bitcoin and that's the end of it.  Confirmation times are irrelevant... once a transaction is made and broadcast it is irreversible.
Bitcoin is the only network of value for decentralized payments.  Other networks will be used for other things down the road, but not for decentralized trustless payments.

turn the horizontal chart vertical, it's not a perfect bell curve, but it's something that can signify potential large movements upwards.  there's two of them in the long-term bitcoin chart, and many are speculating there will be a third

@_date: 2015-03-29 20:39:12
dudetalking right about one thing... Coinbase and other services will likely take on this roll as "Bitcoin banks" in the future.  This has mostly to do with regulations.  
The nice thing about Bitcoin storage is that it is ultra low cost. There is also no central bank authority that can print more Bitcoins or meddle with interest rates.
When the central banks meddle with interest rates and push them artificially low, we get a situation like we have today where lower class citizens around the world have no where to save their money.
Bitcoin is really the only option outside of precious metals or other small fungible commodities like gemstones.
The traditional model of capitalism (save money and invest) is basically destroyed and we are left with a (borrow and speculate)
So, the question is, where do you save your money when the money is being debased?  The Fed has pushed us right up against the wall, which unfortunately, is destroying natural economic order with each passing day

Instant payments are already available to consumers with VISA/Mastercard and other payment platforms such as ApplePay.
Network security, decentralization, transparency, network effect, macro adoption, are more important than faster confirmation times.  This has been proven by the countless cryptocurrencies people have created that have gone nowhere.
The Bitcoin confirmation "problem" is rapidly becoming a non-issue as more services are developed to enable instant payments backed with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-03-28 01:16:17
Yeah... there's no reason why he could not use Coinbase to buy BTC...
I've used many services to acquire BTC... Circle, Coinbase, Kraken, Bitstamp, Snapswap etc and many more are available in the US and Europe.. 
As for AML, no, once your friend has the BTC, he can send it to blockchain.info or use the Coinbase mobile wallet... or any other mobile wallets...
Once he has the private key(s) Bitcoins they are his to do with as he wishes.  As for converting them to USD in Australia... there's a number of services or he could use a localbitcoins service and convert to cash with individuals

This professor is not an expert in digital currencies but seems to be pursuing academic research on them. 
Regardless, he does a decent job deflecting the fear-based assumptions of politicians.
If you take issue with something in the video, perhaps you could post a rebuttal and we could collect these rebuttals and present them to the professor and CAD Senate

I think he was merely expressing a bullish outlook from a technical chart analysis, as the long-term Bitcoin chart does indeed have that perfect bell curve shape
Of course, he also says that there are many factors which need to be considered by investors

Start with Satoshi's whitepaper, and look at the references at the bottom: 
As for scholarly articles, you will need to search a scholarly database which should be available from your college - I'm not aware of 13 "scholarly" sources on Bitcoin - but Andreas Antonopolous and other authors should also lead you down the right path: 
Andreas' book is free btw: 
@_date: 2015-03-23 02:28:17
Darkcoin has done well unfortunately the protocol relies on quite a bit of centralization of Master Nodes which are a potential vulnerability in the entire anonymous scheme. Monero and ShadowCash are others that people are developing.  
The reality is that the Bitcoin blockchain provides transparency which is extremely valuable for many reasons.

I think it's amazing that money can be stored in the blockchain completely outside of any banking institution and only you have access to it with your private keys.
Show them how much money and transactions are occurring constantly in the blockchain
