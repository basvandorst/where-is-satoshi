Thanks for the help!
Just to confirm, mined (and gifted) coins aren't considered income until traded for USD?  And you're suggesting declaring them as regular income as opposed to capital gains?   Could you declare them as capital gains anyway, with a cost of zero?  (I think capital gains tax rate might be cheaper than the standard income rate for me)
Edit: About the gold coins, it seems like the profit from the bitcoins that were used to purchase the coins would still be going undeclared.

Awesome!  I have a few questions. (US citizen)
To declare capital gains tax, I would need to calculate the cost basis of each amount that I sell, correct?  That sounds like a huge accounting nightmare, considering they came from various sources: some purchased from multiples exchanges (some of which no longer operate), some were mined, some were gifted, etc.  I even did some daytrading at some point, but that might have even been a loss, I can't recall.  
Clearly I'm very unorganized.  To simplify matters, could I just declare capital gains with a cost of zero?  (seems like the IRS shouldn't mind, since they would benefit from this simplification)
Also do mined coins require any declaration beyond the capital gains tax?  If so, should I go to the effort of refiling past year returns?  (again, sounds like an accounting nightmare if I need to calculate the value of each block as it was mined)
I purchased a few gold coins using bitcoins.  Does that purchase need to be declared as well?
Do I need to hire an account with specific knowledge of Bitcoin?
Thank you!!
