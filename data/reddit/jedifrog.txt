Hi guys, thanks for the AMA. What do you guys think about:
1. Coinjoin? 
2. Integrating into services such as keybase.io for proof of identity type services?
3. Identity management using sidechains?
4. Browser Extension Wallets?
5. Sidechains in general?
Do you guys have any nice Christmassy type promos in the pipeline?
