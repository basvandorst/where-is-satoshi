Given the crowd that has flocked to cryptocurrency in recent months/years, my concern with "Bitcoin chocolate" would be "I don't know if this person used their own bodily fluids as an ingredient".

Nor can the thousands of morons who upvoted this garbage.  This should tell anyone everything they need to know about the "cryptocurrency community".

Along with frequently failing at basic math, members of this sub and other cryptocurrency subs seem to struggle with spelling basic words such as "lose".
Definitely a bunch of future titans of the financial world here.

That awkward moment where thousands of the self-described future titans of industry and finance fail horrifically at performing basic math.

You could have easily met scam artists on the internet either way.


Unfortunately for you, most of those lottery tickets were already cashed in by the people who sold them to you.

Desperate bagholders, mostly.

Will Brock Pierce move on when bitcoin turns 18?

...because in a few more years, when it doesn't actually exist, you'll be able to stop pretending.

It's pure math, bruh.

Most people donate their bowel movements to porta-potties for free.  If you're interested in a great investment opportunity and want to go against the grain, I can probably find you someone who would be willing to sell you the contents of one.

Or not.
