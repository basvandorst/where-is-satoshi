Pretty ironic for a festival that is all about not using money

I stand corrected - That could very much be the case, good thought

It is true that the price reflects demand but that does not mean you can forecast future demand with past demand, hence my comparison with roulette. Furthermore, bitcoin is a "currency", as such it should be stable in price otherwise its not useful as a currency...

I just love how the community tries to find new hidden truths to point out that bitcoin will grow in perpetuity. Especially when they use past returns to indicate future returns. It is like playing roulette and saying: "Hey the last five times it was red so it must be red a sixth time".

Totally agree, the article in question does absolutely nothing in that regard, he only tries to predict future returns with some past price developments which is absolut nonsene, hence my comparison

If the price has all the information already in it (efficient market theory) THEN the trend is absolutely irrelevant since it is already included in the price. So you just completely destroyed your own argument...

5K or below, They hype is over and soon the invested redditors will slowly get their money out and it will drop

So you are saying that the last 2 month trend is more relevant than the last 18 months? Hmmm, boiii
