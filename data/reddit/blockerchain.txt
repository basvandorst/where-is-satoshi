Why? The fork is public knowledge and is already priced into the current market.

See you tomorrow.

They act to increase transaction throughput, which increases adoption and makes them earn more fees.

He said a single pie in a mine. So it depends on the hardness of the ore. Honestly, I don't think it will last for a month.
@_date: 2017-10-07 21:40:21
Still miners. They will get paid by transaction fees.
Other people might claim it is run by nodes. Miners just do time-stamping.
The truth is somewhere in the middle.
@_date: 2017-10-07 18:41:53
Different opinions about bitcoin scaling mostly.
@_date: 2017-10-07 19:21:14
No, not really.
@_date: 2017-10-07 21:50:21
Currently ~5-15% of the miners' income is from fees. That number will be increased if fees are rising or blocks can support more transactions.
@_date: 2017-10-08 13:03:47
One way to benefit would be to force bitcoin being a settlement layer with small numbers of transactions. You can benefit from commercial solutions for 2nd layer currency transfers. 
@_date: 2017-10-08 17:37:25
Around 15% to 30% fees.

Oh my... I am so happy when all the campaigns from people like OP are over in November.
Hopefully then we can focus on actual technology development in bitcoin again.
Have a downvote.
@_date: 2017-10-07 18:35:27
The amount of energy consumed by mining is not really related to the amount of transactions.
@_date: 2017-10-07 18:38:37
They are not trying to harm bitcoin, but they prefer different ways of scaling bitcoin.
In addition, the developers for segwit2x are paid by different companies than the developers of the current bitcoin core. Some people don't like the other companies.
@_date: 2017-10-07 20:17:29
It is open source and there are multiple people working on it. Some might not be paid at all. One of the main developers is Jeff Garzik. His linked in account tells you for which companies he is working.

Distribute across the top 6 cryptos according to their relative market caps.
@_date: 2017-10-07 19:42:58


Assuming that the pepole owning the most bitcoin are less evil. Which could be true.
@_date: 2017-10-07 20:38:29
Some people posting in the segwit2x github are paid by blockstream. I assume jeff garzik receives salary from blog. Others might be paid by different companies. 
@_date: 2017-10-08 19:37:32
Did you invent a Perpetuum mobile? Or is someone else paying for it? 
@_date: 2017-10-07 23:40:20
Might be different for SPV wallets, which might jump between chains following the longest PoW?! Is this correct?
@_date: 2017-10-07 19:32:59
I didn't hear about jeff garzik being paid by Bitmain.  Do you have information about this? 
And everyone significant working with bitcoin was invited to the NYA meeting. The Roadmap and notes of the meeting are all public.

Here is jeff's linked in page:
And decentralised projects are usually controlled by a few people with commit access and whatever they perceive as consensus. Whether this is better or worse is up to you.
@_date: 2017-10-07 19:05:58
In the long-term trend it does not look fine.
@_date: 2017-10-07 19:07:20
That is great news!
@_date: 2017-10-07 19:04:21
How is this related to developers on an open source project
@_date: 2017-10-07 18:22:38
Segwit2x has a different group of developers. People want to keep the current group of developers.
@_date: 2017-10-08 12:57:45
Except some problems arise from the fork. Then the price will go further down. 
@_date: 2017-10-08 19:30:39
? Bitcoin cash has nearly no transactions at all.
@_date: 2017-10-07 18:46:48


That is called proof-of-stake and exists in some altcoins.
And just for voting it exists on 
@_date: 2017-10-08 09:47:01
Would be nice to have alternative bitcoin implementations in order to avoid this.
