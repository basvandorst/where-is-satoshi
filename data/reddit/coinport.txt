Alright, I'll stop it.
@_date: 2014-08-22 00:56:31
I just don't see how I became high risk overnight. And when I contacted support, they told me to Verify my SSN, Proof of Address, etc. to become Level 2, which raises your limits and adds further verification. Now I still can't buy, and instead of explaining how I am high risk, one of their support members showed me the TOS I agreed to. 
@_date: 2014-08-22 12:18:19
Thanks. I just emailed them again.
@_date: 2014-08-15 17:26:51
True. Our exchange, however, has more Bitcoin in our hot wallet than the value of all our users NXT holdings. But as for other exchanges, where NXT is traded more actively, it will pose a problem.
@_date: 2014-08-16 14:09:18
Yep. But right now, we doubt that the US government even has us on the radar. But as we get bigger, we will have a backup server/plan in case an event like this happens.
@_date: 2014-08-14 23:22:17
Sorry. We didn't know about that.
@_date: 2014-08-22 00:38:46
Hmmmm, I've never heard a story like this. :)
@_date: 2014-08-15 16:18:36
I don't know. If they do are hard fork, users like me will be very disappointing. A fork destroys the whole concept of a Blockchain.
@_date: 2014-08-15 13:00:00
Thanks Daniel!
@_date: 2014-09-20 17:08:51
Omg! Just transferred $50 through a credit card, and I sent the bitcoins within 5 seconds! Awesome!
@_date: 2014-08-14 17:46:15
We're hoping to pick up some more users and volume before we get begin to take fist. We will open it to beta testers in the coming months though.
Also, what we need actually is your user ID, which you will find right above your username in the My Profile Tab in the Account Section.

@_date: 2014-08-15 22:52:17
Yep! I'm waiting for Daniel to get online and re activate the market.
Sorry for the inconvenience,

@_date: 2014-08-14 20:33:49
Expect the bonus within 24-48 hours! Also, leaving an open order near the market price counts as a trade, and will help us out a lot with liquidity!
@_date: 2014-08-22 00:44:35
@_date: 2014-08-26 20:18:26
Sure. Are you interested in the job?
@_date: 2014-08-14 23:58:00
Sure. We're working on API right now.
@_date: 2014-08-14 20:52:52
Yep. Somebody else found a list of bugs, however, none of them were security bugs. :)
@_date: 2014-08-15 12:49:41
We haven't yet began fiat beta testing yet! We do plan to include RMB, and would you like us to sign you up for the beta?
@_date: 2014-09-20 00:54:26
Yep. Just bought some, and if the priced gets any lower, I'm going to buy some more!
@_date: 2014-09-19 22:57:31
Transferring was so easy. Bought $50 worth in a few seconds! 
@_date: 2014-08-15 17:28:39
I agree. BTER is responsible for this, and what they should do if buy back some NXT and give it back to their users. Maybe they'll finally learn about a magical thing called **Cold Storage**.
@_date: 2014-08-15 12:45:03
We don't plan to add stellar soon. Perhaps in a few months.

Oh, I get it. Lol.

We understand. We hope that as we have get more volume, more users, and more review, we can gain a reputation.
Thank you for giving us a chance, and enjoy the 0 trading fees!
@_date: 2014-08-14 16:13:18
I believe I can explain it all. 
1. The founders/engineers of the exchange are located in Shanghai, with the exception of one founder, me. (I live in the U.S.)2
2. In order to  be spared from the regulating eyes of Mainland Chinese Government, but to still be treated as official and legitimate, the company was incorporated in Hong Kong.
3. However, the company itself is owned by Coinport Inc (Cayman Islands, no taxes), who is registered in the Cayman islands. Coinport INC partially owned and sponsored by Feng Li, a venture capitalist belonging to the firm IDG Capital Partners.
If that hasn't cleared this up, perhaps our Coindesk article will do a better job: 
Hope this helps. I understand that it does seem shady, but Chinese Banks don't want to have anything to do with bitcoin, which is why we registered in Hong Kong, and are owned by IDG Partners in the Cayman Islands (no taxes!).
Thanks you for your interest,
The Coinport Team
@_date: 2014-09-07 23:51:01
Anybody do this stuff?
@_date: 2014-08-15 13:10:18
1. Plans to add the following coins: Vertcoin, Monero, Namecoin, and Stellar
2. Expand charts to more periods (Add 1 minutes, 5 minutes, 15 minutes, and 1 hour)
3. Add API. We've been hearing a lot of clamor for this, so we're working on it right now!
4. Proving ownership of our reserve wallets with use of signatures.
5. Let users trade on margin. (This is just an idea, and if worked on, it probably won't be out for at least a few months.)
Hope this helps,

Sounds like a great idea! We've been hearing a lot about that signature stuff, and we plan to implement it soon!
@_date: 2014-08-15 13:13:43
I understand. In fact, I do know a lot about signing wallets, but I didn't want to go on and on about it. Meanwhile, I won't lie about it, we aren't that experienced in the crypto exchange world. I know we're relatively new, but we hope to build ourselves a reputation over time, through our transparency, fast withdrawals, and of course, never using our users coins. I'm sorry if I appeared unprofessional in anyway.
I understand your concerns, and I hope that we might gain your trust one day,

No problem. Come and try it anytime you want, and together we can make the future standard the present standard!
@_date: 2014-08-15 17:11:57
Yes, but bitcoin has been through hard forks due to problems with the code, never thefts like this.

Thanks MuchWowScience!
I assume you are a Shibe, correct? Expect to see the bonus within 1-2 days!
Well in any case,
Such Thanks,

No problem Daniel. I wish you guys the best of luck, and if I can ever help you guys out, just let me know. :)

Not yet, we're working on it!
Thanks for your interest, it really does mean a lot to us,
The Coinport Team
@_date: 2014-08-14 20:27:11
True. I'll tell Daniel to code that in. :)
@_date: 2014-08-14 20:17:11
Yes, thank you for bringing this to our attention. We see that the bitcoin fee is 2x what it should be. Expect to see the fee go down within 24-48 hours. Are there any other overpriced withdrawal fees? I'm not that familiar with NXT or BTSX.
The Coinport Team
@_date: 2014-08-14 18:52:43
I'll work on getting Daniel to lower it. If there's one thing altcoin traders like me hate, it's exorbitant withdrawal fees. 
Thanks for pointing this out,
The Coinport Team
P.S. We're working on a system to credit you guys with the bonus, so you should expect to see it within 2 days or less.

Thanks! Have you received your bonus of 1mbtc yet?
@_date: 2014-08-14 22:04:29
Kinda true. If you are headquartered, host your servers, or rely on a U.S. Bank account, you're required to do all that Know Your Customer Crap. But luckily, we're not. However, if we do open a U.S. Bank account to process fiat, we will require KYC, but we will try to avoid that at all costs.
@_date: 2014-08-14 17:28:10

@_date: 2014-08-22 00:44:30
I have contacted Coinbase support. Your support member "Seth" refused to take me of the high risk list, and instead referenced the User Agreement and TOS which stated that Coinbase has the right to refuse to sell bitcoins to me. Here is a screenshot of the reply I got: 
Could you manually remove me off the "High Risk" category please?
@_date: 2014-09-20 15:13:16
Lol. Yep. I must say, it's absolutely wonderful. Fast, easy to use. Never using Coinbase again!
@_date: 2014-08-14 20:11:47
Yep. We're adding Namecoin, Vertcoin, and Monero within a month!
@_date: 2014-08-14 20:24:26
Yep! No taxes!
@_date: 2014-08-22 00:45:53
I did do a bit of research. Take a look:
Those are just a few.
@_date: 2014-08-14 17:26:28
Sorry. Didn't mean to say that. A bit of pride began to creep in. What I meant was: It's been audited to *find* security bugs. But I'll take that all down. Sorry for confusing you.
@_date: 2014-08-14 23:12:53
@_date: 2014-08-22 00:40:18
I just don't see what might have triggered it. I've been a loyal Coinbase user for months. I've bought and sold at least $20,000 through them. If they let me knew what triggered their system that defines me as "high risk", then I'd understand.
@_date: 2014-10-01 14:39:54
I'd recommend moving to circle. I ditched coin base when I got a circle invite, and circle has been awesome. Fast support, and you can withdraw your bitcoins immediately! It's awesome!
@_date: 2014-08-15 12:48:32
Unfortunately, no. We're a small group of programmers, and our exchange isn't yet that big, but once we take off, we will be hiring more developers, security experts, and support agents!
The Coinport Team
@_date: 2014-08-15 12:52:38
Sure. I'm just a usually serious person, so I wanted to appear a bit cheerful though. You know, I'm not a support agent, so I figured I didn't need to be stone cold, but I understand.

Thanks Sigals. With full transparency means you can view our code, see our bugs fixes, and watch us work on it. The only downside is many lazy scammers will attempt to use our code to clone our site and scam some people out of there coins.
@_date: 2014-09-20 19:25:32
Sorry, but the only way to get an invite is directly from Circle. :(
@_date: 2014-08-22 12:21:46
I understand. :) Then, do you think you could ask them to remove me from the high risk list? I took all the other steps your support members "Dan" and "Seth" said. I added 2FA, and verified my account up to level 2.
@_date: 2014-08-15 22:50:25
It seems their Dogecoin hot wallet went dry for an hour, the they have now refiled it, and the problem has been solved.
@_date: 2014-09-08 11:31:32
What do you mean?
@_date: 2014-08-15 13:33:18
Yes. However, altcoin trading is quite popular, and we hope to overthrown Mintpal or Cryptsy. Once we have a large user base (5k+) we plan to introduce Fiat. **The most important thing is to find a way to avoid KYC regulation, because it's simply terrible, and such a hassle**.

True. We plan to add only reputable coins with a respectable market cap, and no premined scams. We want to keep it fast an easy to trade, like you said, you'll never have to search through pairs and pairs of coins to find what you want. We're also working on API, and we'll roll it out in a week or two. About the transparency, all trades will be identifiable by the userID, which we assume some people will benefit from, however, we want to remain completely open, and in any case, it will benefit the big traders by letting the public know their hand.
The Coinport Team

Thanks! When we trade altcoins, we hate having to refresh the page for prices, so we made everything streaming! And please include a screenshot of the items that aren't displaying nicely, as we'll attempt to fix it! Also, we hate all those new scumcoins/premined scams, they won't ever be on our exchange.

@_date: 2014-09-20 15:35:26
Did it work?
@_date: 2014-08-15 22:41:14
Nah, I think NXT will easily live through this.
@_date: 2014-11-11 05:42:45
It's so obvious they only want tips. Instead of reading about bitcoin, I guess they naturally run here and ask, acting innocent as hell.
@_date: 2014-08-15 22:54:32
We would love to do that, but many of our traders use our exchange as an arbitrage opportunity, because for some reason, of Vericoin market always is a bit below market price, and our Dogecoin/Blackcoin market is a tiny bit above market price. We couldn't have no hot wallets, as many arbitrage traders could get hurt in the small period it'd take to move coins from cold storage, as we all know how volatile altcoins can be.
Hope this answers your question,
The Coinport Team
@_date: 2014-09-08 01:37:30
It's not lucky, just **unlikely** that one pool will find a block less than a second after another pool has. I saw it happen twice. :)

Hey Sherlockcoin
Simply sign up at our website  deposit some coins, and begin trading, you should see the bonus credited to your account with 24-48 hours. However, you have to reply to this with your userID, which you can find under the My Profile Tab, when you click on the Accounts Button at the top right of the page. Please don't sign up if you only wish to get the bonus. We want traders who believe in our exchanges transparent, low cost, streaming design.
The Coinport Team
@_date: 2014-08-15 17:06:48
Absolutely! It's BTER's fault that the coins were lost. They should pay their users back. Any in any case, if they put some funds in cold storage, none of this would've happened, but it seems that they have no concept of security. Speaking of which, our exchange  keeps 90% of all funds in cold storage, so as to avoid problems like these!
@_date: 2014-08-15 16:48:04
Never thought of payday. People buying BTC with NXT won't push up the BTC-USD price, only hammer the  NXT price. But we do think BTC is in for a rally.
@_date: 2014-08-14 21:34:01
What were the issues on your Nokia! We plan to add Vertcoin soon! Please post your userID so we can give you the 1mbtc for trying us out!
@_date: 2014-12-29 20:27:51
I'm interested. Sent you a PM.
@_date: 2014-08-16 18:56:48

First off, I hate to say it, but I am no longer affiliated with Coinport. I found out that a venture capitalist firm has bought a 20% share, so the owner didn't want to give me a share of the company, so once again, Wall Street crowds the little guy like me. :(
Contact d and maybe he'll do something about it.
@_date: 2014-08-14 20:26:14
Were not headquartered in the U.S. for precisely that reason. However, there is still the slightest chance we'll require it to prevent fraudulent transaction, but we hope we won't. We know what a turnoff ID's and Proof of Address are. Would you like to be signed up for beta testing of fiat deposits?
The Coinport Team
@_date: 2014-08-15 18:29:45
Hmmm, we'll get someone to work on it as soon as we can. We only tested our site with Maxthon, Google Chrome, and IE 10-11, so we're working on fixing some bugs in firefox.

Hey There!
I just got a response from a support team member saying your DOGE hot wallets were empty, which I understand. However, we are using your exchange to provide liquidity to our exchange, so we can always have the best prices. Meanwhile, how do you like our idea of extreme transparency?
All the best,

We're not yet sure.
We'll Keep You Posted,
The Coinport Team
@_date: 2014-08-21 23:08:17
Coinbase is such a scam it's not even funny. If the price plummets right after you buy, they're more than happy to give you the bitcoin. If you buy right at the low however, and the price goes up $70, then they call you a "high risk customer", even though you've used them for months.
@_date: 2014-08-22 14:09:57
But I did verify everything!
@_date: 2014-08-15 17:10:17
I understand. We plan to reopen NXT markets within 12 hours or less. Meanwhile, take a look at this 
How ironic? The developer who forked Vericoin tells NXT not to fork.
@_date: 2014-08-14 22:00:33
Great! Expect your bonus to appear in 1-2 days.
Thank you guys for your interest, it means a lot,
The Coinport Team
@_date: 2014-08-15 16:28:08
Yep. We see NXT falling quite a bit when it comes back online. The big holders will try to use buy walls to support the price, but it won't help.
@_date: 2014-08-15 19:51:55
1 hour and it still hasn't gone though.
@_date: 2014-08-15 17:25:17
Yep. **We think nothing is materially wrong with NXT**, and a few people with dump their holdings, but in the end, NXT is still the same as it was before this.
@_date: 2014-08-22 01:10:58
Here are a few other cases:
    
@_date: 2014-09-20 15:55:26
@_date: 2014-08-15 22:43:48
Not at all. You see, rolling back the blockchain to prevent a theft is terrible, while take a hard fork to fix a security issue is completely acceptable. Bitcoin was forked only to fix security issues.
@_date: 2014-08-14 14:41:51
Hey Guys,
I'm one of the founders of Coinport. We haven't been picking up business lately, as many people simply don't want to give us a chance. So, for the next 1000 users that join, we'll give you free trade fees + 0.001 btc, simply if deposit and trade. Any feedback?
@_date: 2014-08-21 23:10:59
Yep, but that's not the case for Coinbase. If you get some bitcoin $70 cheaper than market price, **you don't get the coins at all, and you become " a high risk customer".**
@_date: 2014-09-02 22:53:41
I hate that fat fuck.
@_date: 2014-08-22 01:08:58
But the only thing is nobody's complained of being marked as "High Risk" when the price of bitcoin's gone down since they bought. Either a lot of people are embarrassed that they bought at the wrong time and I'm really missing something here, or Coinbase's risk algorithm goes into overdrive every time the price of bitcoin spikes. Oh, btw, I bought a total of 1 btc the past couple of days, so it wasn't $1.50 that I missed out on, it was $70. That might not sound like a lot, but $70 is a lot to me. I do understand your point though. :)
@_date: 2014-08-14 16:27:21
Post your username on our thread here to get a 1mbtc bonus!
@_date: 2014-08-14 20:22:17
It is truly, truly open. Here: 
That is our live audit for Bitcoin. You can track your deposits and watch them move from your deposit address and watch the coins spilt up and go to both the hot and cold wallet! You can watch other users deposits/withdrawals too! However, keep in mind the maximum withdrawal is 0.3 btc, and anything above that will be approved manually, so a large withdrawal might take an hour or two to approve. We plan to raise the limit to 1 btc soon, so as to attract larger customers. You can also view all trades, and download all data!
Thank you for your interest,

Hmmm. Could you include a screenshot of the pages that didn't display nicely? We'll see if we can fix it.
Sorry for the inconvenience,

No. What is said is that forks destroy the **concept** of a blockchain, my friend. Does anybody else concur? I did not say, however, that a fork destroys a blockchain. I did not say that at all.

Sure! Create your account, deposit, and leave an open order near the market price (preferably, because it helps us out with liquidity), or trade, then post your *userID*, not username (you can find this in the My Profile section of Accounts, and expect your bonus to come in 1-2 days!

Of course. Right now, fees are free for the next 1000 users that sign up, and it will always remain so for them. As altcoin traders,  we know how painful fees can be, so I constantly get Daniel to lower fees. We might lower the fee for the maker of the order to 0.05%, so as to entice more liquidity, which promotes market stability!
Thanks for that comment, it makes us feel good.

They are already in English. If not, just look in the Top Right Hand corner of the page, and click on the American flag. That will give you the English version of the website including the privacy agreements.
