Any plans on allowing bitcoin purchases in the iphone version of the app?

I more than likely will seeing as the difficulty from when I ordered this was around 10,000,000 and now it's a just tad bit higher at 510,000,000.

Anyone have any suggestions on a good mining pool to use nowadays? I haven't mined since MTRed went down.

Good call thanks! But is there a technical reason behind this or is it Apple's strict app policies?

When I ordered it, it was $274. No tax or shipping in my case. 7.5GH/s

More info:
1. I live really close to where they make these in Kansas, but they will not allow pickups. They shipped it regardless saying, "
I apologize for any inconvenience, but at this time we are unable to accommodate pickups at our location. However, we will be shipping your order today or tomorrow, and it should reach you very soon. "
Not too sure why but ok. I choose this so I wouldn't have to pay shipping, but they shipped it to my house anyways and didn't charge shipping so that was kind of cool I guess.
2. This was supposed to be the 5GH/s Jalapeno but it's actually pulling a constant 7.5GH/s which is a nice add on considering the form factor was supposed to be half the size earlier. An overall win in this case.
3. The temps are no higher than 58C so it really doesn't run too much hotter than my very OC'd i7 on minor loads.
4. The noise it makes is much like a very small dust buster or most modern video cards with it running at 50%, (using my 7970 as an example).
Adding more as I see it. Still currently setting it up actually. Just posting my thoughts so far. 
The basic program that BFL suggests you use with all defaults on. I haven't changed anything on it yet.
And the settings tab.
I'm not sure but it looks like by default it just mines for Eclipse MC and holds the funds at the pool. Not sure how that works. I'll be changing it to my own pool once I figure out a good pool to mine for.
