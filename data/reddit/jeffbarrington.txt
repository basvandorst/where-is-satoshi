MtGox is not the name of the price burst, it is the name of an exchange that got hacked which caused the price to burst. No such thing has happened right now as was pointed out.

I'm new-ish to bitcoin. I thought bitcoin had problems with transaction fees and speed which made it unsuitable for being used as a currency at the moment (see the discussion on the lemonade stand thread that was here yesterday). How is Japan dealing with that? I tried searching for information about people using bitcoin in transactions in Japan and couldn't find anything solid to suggest it was particularly widespread. You'd have thought we'd have seen people posting on this subreddit 'wow, I'm in Tokyo, just bought a t-shirt with bitcoin lol', but no, we haven't seen that.

I think it is from one of the more recent SpaceX launches, and the only booster which has recently crashed into the ocean unintentionally was Falcon Heavy's centre core (although success wasn't fully expected anyway). This is not Falcon Heavy, and it has landing legs on it so wasn't expended, so I think this one landed.

It's all relative though. In cities in the UK (and I take it the US too) crypto payment is very rare to non-existent. A 'handful' is a lot in comparison, and those are just the ones you know of. Even a small amount of real-world advertising is more than the nothing I've seen, and belies the fact that trading is indisputably big there (if confined to the online environment).
I agree, I've seen dumb articles claiming it is commonplace in Asia to pay with crypto, but the truth is probably just that they're slightly ahead of the west as regards adoption.

They have been removed from most with maybe one notable exception (the one they managed to land in the sea in-tact and subsequently scuttled).

I love the sand dunes there.
Not sure if you've been, but have a look to El Cotillo and Jandia beaches if that's your thing.

'a Euro today is a Euro tomorrow'
so one Euro = one Euro? This is like people on r/dogecoin saying 1 doge = 1 doge lol

'cum' is a word meaning, in this sense, that he is both a programmer and cryptographer. Youths these days.

Not out of the realms of possibility if it catches on further in the future. Faster, more efficient transport will most likely accelerate trade between different countries, and a decentralised currency will be the best way to pay for it. There are significant hurdles to overcome before that can happen of course.

With SK and China having both done this now, is it just dumb politicians who know nothing about cryptocurrency making stupid statements, the government then actually doing some research and realising they can't ban it/that cryptocurrency could actually be useful and then retracting the earlier statement, or are these governments just doing this to FUD the price down so they can buy it up cheap for themselves, knowing EXACTLY how useful it is?

I know the original film was called 'Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory' because Roald Dahl didn't approve of it and didn't want it to be called 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory', so I would have thought that extended to all of its releases.
