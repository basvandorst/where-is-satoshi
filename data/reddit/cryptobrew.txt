I agree with this, and I think its likely maybe an 85% chance it won't be approved and we will see a crash to the 800s.
@_date: 2017-02-27 00:41:07
Actually from what I read the decision will be made before the 11th.  Either it will be approved or the Winklevoss twins will be allowed to bow out gracefully and withdraw their proposal.  Probably it won't be approved.

Sure in a way there is an objective metric for POW, but don't forget that this metric can be thrown out anytime by the community, as was done for ETC and ETH.  If more of the community decided ETC was the real chain then ETH might die completely and this is a possibility in POW as history has proven.  You could even consider Bitcoin proved this when it hardforked in the past as well.
So saying that POS is not trustless does not make sense to me.  If POS is not trustless then neither is POW.  As most things in life its not black and white, and the trust is distributed across all players of the network.

I don't know, I don't read too much into the hedge fund thing, that could be happening regardless of ETF and not, plus I doubt insider information is getting out that far.  The one thing I see going for the ETF is the new administration is a lot more sympathetic to deregulation, and open to free markets.  Also I heard there are a lot of pro-bitcoin people working within the administration.  If it was Obama still in power I would put acceptance chance at much lower.

It doesn't much matter though.  If big blockers want to block segwit out of stubborness then fine, [there are other plans](  It will be pushed through regardless of what big block shills say.

I disagree with this part:


We have seen with the ETH/ETC split that its possible for the decentralized community to choose which chain and they can choose a chain with lesser proof-of-work if they decide.  So POW consensus is really not so different than POS consensus as they claim.  Fundamentally they are very similar.

This was the dumbest post I ever read.

Maybe they were hoping it would become regulated.
@_date: 2017-03-11 04:24:15
But on the contrary, their regulations and banker bailouts were partly what spurred the innovation of Bitcoin.  This is why Satoshi put in the Genesis block an article about Banker Bailouts.  In the end this makes us stronger.

Yes there is room for you right next to the homophobes and the slut shamers.
@_date: 2017-03-09 01:15:26
Nobody cares about the answer. Its to show that its a double standard, nobody cared about men's day, they are part of the evil patriarchy.
@_date: 2017-03-09 00:26:56
I am glad you don't mind hanging out in a community full of racist, misogynist, privileged white males like myself.

When is men's day?

Bureaucracies usually have a lot more organization and gatekeepers than grassroots popular movements.

The market has been shown to be pretty resilient.

lol, it was sarcasm....sorry left off the /s

Here you go: 
@_date: 2017-03-10 01:23:26
Here you go, you can pay with your Visa Credit Card to accelerate the transaction:  
It looks like it will cost you $6.50 with your Visa card to accelerate your transaction.  Sorry about this, but it will improve once miners adopt BU and the blocksize is raised increasing capacity and lowering fees.

Ohh so are you racist against white men?
@_date: 2017-03-11 02:56:12
You don't know how incentives work, which is pretty worrying considering your influence on Bitcoin.  Anybody could nuke all mining warehouses and take over Bitcoin too, does this mean that all mining facilities must be held in nuke proof bunkers?? 
@_date: 2017-03-11 03:04:08
Yeah you obviously are no Satoshi Nakamoto....But I know you only refer to him as "Bitcoin's Creator" because you fear him.  You have no clue how the incentive system in Bitcoin works.  You only miss the forest for the trees as Gavin Andresen has said.
@_date: 2017-03-08 21:25:04
I have not but I heard about it from Roger Ver.  I guess its run by Bitmain and Jihan Wu, so my guess is its legit.
@_date: 2017-03-03 08:30:23
I would expect that type of response from somebody who does not understand how the incentive system in blockchain works.
@_date: 2017-03-08 20:51:27
You can use your visa card to pay for the transaction to be accelerated.  It looks like it will cost you $4.66 with your visa card: 
@_date: 2017-03-10 01:18:16
I think the ETF will be disapproved likely because of fears over a fork and a lack of a scaling solution.  We should have handled this years ago I guess like Gavin suggested then maybe we could have had the ETF.
