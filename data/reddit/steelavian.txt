I guess my understanding is a little different, I thought you basically borrow X BTC for a fee, sell it so you have fiat, buy back at a lower price and return it allowing you to trade with a lot more BTC than you could afford. Your profit (or loss) is the price change in bitcoin minus the fee.
Is that something else?

Has nobody made a paper wallet generating java/.net/python application yet? Or is the official client it?
@_date: 2014-01-08 15:52:32
I think it's neat that people show their crafty ideas for QR codes and it doesn't really bother me that they use their own; if I was inspired to take the time to craft something I'd probably be interested in using my own code for my own uses (and I wouldn't expect random internet BTC to come in.)
I don't think people here would just give coins to a random QR for no reason. I think it's just a stupid "look I made this" post, not necessarily a motive for begging. You get votes for this, so use them.

The same as running the same GPU in another pool you mean? Is GPU mining actually still practical?
@_date: 2014-01-29 21:03:26
Thanks, Bitfinex is doing exactly what I was wondering
@_date: 2014-02-25 14:50:24
Yes, he said something about re-purposing it when all this started.
@_date: 2014-01-14 16:38:48
Yeah, individually. Seems like GPU is too. Even ganged up it would still be useless?

Have them use a tool to make the keys with BIP38 encoding, but don't let them tell you their password.
They can use bitaddress.org to generate a paper wallet with encoding, then send you the public and private encrypted keys, without the PW.

This is the most gold I've ever seen in one place

I wonder if short circuiting the query to search by date range first would reduce that time. Maybe the number of transactions in a single day would be manageable? I took a peek at your link but it's too late for me to learn something new today (tomorrow?) in EST. I appreciate the response though, quick checks like this would let lay people spot scammers a little easier -- maybe there will be something akin to biting a gold coin for casual bitcoin claims soon.
Edit: spelling, it's late.

That's a cool feature! Thanks
@_date: 2013-11-26 20:09:08
Neat, I'll check that out! Thanks!

Thanks for your comment, I didn't know about lastpass. My point about the paper wallet being printed by an offline live-cd booted computer was that it never existed permanently on any digital storage and wouldn't be susceptible to any malware. If the printer didn't store a copy and it wasn't stored in anything other than RAM, it should only be available on the paper copy.
I agree that having a small amount for spending in a blockchain wallet is probably convenient, but I wouldn't want to put more in there than I could stand to lose (like a physical wallet.)
@_date: 2013-12-11 13:50:59
That's where I got it in the first place... it's not usually right lol
@_date: 2017-06-11 06:27:49
I could make a screenshot like that in ~15 minutes in Fireworks (like Photoshop) and pretend, so yeah I think it's probably fake. It would be nice if there was a "search by amount" public web API that didn't require a desktop client (to be used as a bullshit detector.) Maybe somebody will make one.
Edit: Made my sentence structure a little less confusing.

People don't say this when the value of the dollar changes. It's a problem with the perception of bitcoin; it's not supposed to be an investment it's supposed to be a currency.
When I spent $50 on an NES game in 1994, it would be like spending $85 for it in today's money. I don't regret that I "would have had $85" by not buying it. It's a silly thought.

I downloaded bitaddress.htm from the bitaddress.org site, and it was HTTPS at the time so I assume it was legit. I transferred it via USB stick to the offline machine. I didn't do the PGP verification and I didn't think of the limited seed thing, but I suppose there's always a little risk in this.

Is there any reason Mt Gox couldn't split into multiple copies of itself so there were more entry points? It worked with the big monopolies like Bell Telephone. If there were regional Gox portals and URLs it might give people more options.
@_date: 2017-06-11 06:06:19
Dumb question I guess, but if these numbers were transferred wouldn't the blockchain have records of these exact figures moving between addresses for this date? I have no idea how to check but it would maybe prove or disprove this rather quickly. Also, I don't care about the value but I'd like to know the system is working.
@_date: 2013-04-25 19:55:29
Couldn't those be cloned out too? Gox could split into a number of smaller owned markets and just collect the fees from each. Multiple books, engines, the works. They might have different rates, but so would competitors.
Makes sense to me that they would want to strengthen the market and continue to own a large part of it -- they already made the investment in good tech and security.

I wonder if they are regretting it now. Dwolla was never that convenient on its own. The whole "pay back your friends for small amounts" seems flawed since many friends have no problem taking an IOU for &lt; $10.
@_date: 2013-11-22 23:50:27
I was trying to add 0.003 BTC to this to try it out but apparently I can't send less than 0.01 from Mt. Gox. Is this a real limit?
@_date: 2013-12-11 13:50:08
Working on a bitcoin logo for a project, sorry that wasn't clear
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:05:02
If the new rules for Dwolla are supposed to take affect on May 25th, why do I need to be verified to deposit funds right now? 
@_date: 2013-11-21 15:49:08
Thanks, I'm reasonably confident in the two factor authentication for at least protecting my account details, but it's good to know I can use the app for convenience (search per address is a pain.)

It's interesting that all the suggestions so far have been men. How about Sarah Silverman or Tina Fey?

So it's better after the newbie room?

I wrote an article about how I accomplished adding Bitcoin prices in my store. The store isn't done yet, but I thought I'd share the technique with the community!
Edit: I have no idea why Reddit used the QR code as the article image. Sorry!
@_date: 2013-11-21 17:51:08
One of the posts I read on here ( seemed to indicate that the android app or desktop app has your password in an unencrypted format locally and could be attacked by malware. I'm not sure I want my private keys existing anywhere digitally until I actually want to spend coins. Is that article still accurate?
@_date: 2013-11-23 00:00:28
Oh, good idea. I wasn't thinking that I could tip an address.
@_date: 2013-11-21 16:06:52
"Watch Only" just does the searches on blockchain.info/address/mywalletID for you and lists the balance, it's not actually a wallet in blockchain. It monitors the public key only.
