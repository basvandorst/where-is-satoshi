It will reduce by half on its regular schedule till all have been mined then it will be fees only.
The halving is not like a half life where it keeps reducing by half always having half left.
When the next halving happens  18,375,000 will have been mined.
Then 19,687,500
Then 20,343,750
Then 20,671,875
Then 20,835,937.5
The mining fee becomes small but once the reward is larger than the amount of coins left to be mined the reward is no longer paid.
I started to calculate how close the reward would be in the final block that generates new BTC but my calculator only allow 10 digits past the decimal and I'm not sure how the BTC code will handle that.

The miner can set the size block they want to build. They are not required to include all available transactions if the block is not full. This is the same for BTC and why there are empty blocks at times.

No. There will be less of it going around but it will still be around and worth more per unit.
If all but one BTC were "lost" it could still function as long as we can move the decimal point further to the right.

I just ordered a T9+ yesterday to replace my s7 that had a board die. I will get more hashes for the same power.  
My understanding is that the T9 has less chips and runs at a higher voltage for better stability.  
If you are looking for a different mining hardware company search for the following miners.
Ebit e9 plus
Avalon  
They all have mixed reviews Ebit i have seen reliability issues but it looks like they are similar to some of the S9 issues.
Whatsminer from Pangolin (sp) is less common and not as tested.
Avalon I believe has a good rep but you have to purchase a controller board. The good thing is you can run several off one controller.

No it would still be bitcoin. You would be able to spend and receive a smaller amount.
If Bitcoin reaches $100,000,000 then one Satoshi is $1. At that point we have two options the first being add an extra decimal place that we can use for bitcoin. The second option increase the prices of items to a minimum of one Sat, that will result in demend going to for bitcoin and push the price up then that will demand that items are priced higher. 
This is all assuming that prices are still in USD and that we do not have taxes to pay on items. If we have a 6% tax on an item that cost one sat the tax is now 100% on that item since you can only send one sat minimum.

You are assuming that all acting parties are in on this trying to keep the blocks small and the fees high. 
If they pass a small enough block to reduce the max size of the block then there will be a back log of transactions to be processed other mining pools will pick them up and fill the next block gaining all the fees associated with the skipped transactions.
The only way that it could be kept small is if they continually propagated blocks that are less than 75% full.
With that said what is preventing anyone from doing a withholding attack now the incentive is the same?
Also I added the following to the original post.
Set a limit on decreasing max block size. The smallest block can only be half the size of largest max block size for the last 210 blocks (about 24hrs).
I debated adding a part about a moving floor.
Hard floor 1mb
Moving floor half of the size of the smallest max block since the last difficulty change. (Smallest was 8mb floor becomes 4mb. If the smallest was 1.5mb the floor stays at 1mb.)
@_date: 2017-12-29 18:05:38
No. Currently nodes do not charge a fee they just relay the blocks and transactions.
Miners collect the fee. The fee could be 0 if a miner decides to include it in the block mined. Miners select 1mb of transactions starting with the highest fee so they make more BTC.
@_date: 2015-12-01 17:35:09
They were thinking that a miner would pass a block with as little data as possible to decrease the size. To do that they would need to be the first one with the solution for at least two blocks and have next to no data in the block for that to happen.

Other than increasing the amount of transactions need to continually increase the block size three methods I see to correct/prevent this are as follows.
1. Use the current block size to calculate how full the past blocks were. This will make it harder to continually increase the max block size.
2. Set a limit on increasing max block size. The largest block can only be twice the size of smallest max block size for the last 210 blocks (about 24hrs).
3. Increase the look back for the average instead of 6 blocks (1hr) set it to 18 (3hrs). The network will not respond as fast but it would take much longer to spam.
So if the last 6 blocks were all at 65% full and someone wanted to spam the network to increase the size of the block they would have to fill the next two blocks 100% to push the floating 6 block average over 75%. After that they would have to continue to keep the average over 75% to continue to grow.

The scaling issue needs to be sorted to increase adoption. LN might help but retailers will not manage there own node unless they are already in the crypto space and want to support new technologies.
If coinbase or other processors start using LN it could help but then we are requiring a third party to handle things for us. Yes I know many retailers are using third parties to handle there crypto transactions as it is but that is an issue to be worked on more heavily once the network can quickly handle the current load.

We are moving away from this with the new changes/additions to Bitcoin and back to needing to trust.  The person that I was responding to stated he cannot verify but only trust those he assumes is truthful. My point is that 99% of users do not verify at all they only trust. A better saying for us to adopt would be "Just fucking Verify it."
Lightening adds the need for a little bit of trust to the network. Since party A could replay an old state to try and get coins back. There are measures to prevent this where the party B would show the correct current state and get all of party B coins. This is a low chance of it happening.
Liquid network now adds a trusted centralized federated side chain. This means you have to give trust to the federated members controlling the side chain.
Exchanges we have no option but to trust with out verification.
Anyone that truly believes "Don't trust, verify" would not use Liquid, LN, or any exchange as they currently stand. In the future this might change if they become verifiable and immutable but till then if they want to use them they have to "Trust, yet verify."

That seems like a lot of BTC to use to push up the fees, since the progression of fees from 1 sat to 1400+ sat looks fairly linear to me.  
I would think the better way for someone to make the network look expensive/slow would be to dump as many transactions as possible in the mempool.  I believe the smallest standard transaction would be 146 bytes at 1 sat a byte it would take 6849 transactions to fill a block and cost 1000000 sat or 0.01 BTC to fill a block. So as of now that would cost $64.38 USD to fill one block. For the same cost as the top three sat/byte on the image they could fill 3.6 blocks making it look slower.

I don't think that is it the US gov does not want to have a global currency unless it is the USD (federal reserve note). The USD has become the reserve currency since it is the currency that oil has to be traded in moving away from that would hurt the US and weaken its leverage against other countries.  
Also if they were planning to use Bitcoin they would have held the silk road coins and not sold them off.

I believe that the header only has the calculated difficulty target. This would be fine if using difficulty and not hashrate but that would be more Proof-of-Difficulty in Time Per Bitcoin. It would be fine to use that but it does not count the total global hashrate.  
For example assume there are only 10 pools each has exactly the same hashrate and all blocks are mined at 10min. All works out the calculation based on difficulty in the header, but it is effectively only counting 10&amp; of the total hashrate.  
Now we will say 5 of the pools join together giving them 50&amp; of the global hashrate. They now find a block every 2 minutes. This would make it look like the hashrate jumped significantly even if it is exactly the same. Till the difficulty changes and now the calculation is discounting the other 50&amp; of the network.
Equation for reference:
 PPB=(mined Bitcoin/(Difficulty\*(600seconds/seconds since last block))) 
With 10 pools (using original reward for calc)
With 6 pools
This would not be a problem if there is a mechanism to report total hashes performed since last block. Having the difficulty adjust every block would make it a little more accurate but would not account for small pools or solo miners that find a block every few days.

 For your questions:
\* How prone to miner manipulation is this?
It depends on how you measure a Bitcoin. If it includes fees miners could set the pool to include the lowest fees to fill the block then move to include the highest fees when it benefits them. This would not be a problem if the mempool is cleared every block. Although if most transactions are on LN then the fees are minimal since it is off chain.
If hashes are being "counted" some how it will depend on pools being honest and reporting the total shares the miners of the pool performed in the time period.
My input
Proof-of-work Per Bitcoin (PPB) we have this already calculated/estimated it is the difficulty. To find the change in hash we would do something like (Difficulty\*(600seconds/seconds since last block))=hashcount
Then to complete PPB (mined Bitcoin/hashcount)=PPB
Above does not count for luck so you might want to have it average over the last 3 blocks.
Final equation PPB=(mined Bitcoin/(Difficulty\*(600seconds/seconds since last block)))
@_date: 2018-06-25 17:18:54
It is easy to manipulate due to the small number of holders (Not HODL). The larger the number or people utilizing  Bitcoin for transactions the better and more stable the currency. If most financial transactions were performed in bitcoin then the price would be set more by total movement of money and not based on how much you can buy and sell.

Thanks for letting me know that  there is a security issue in coinomi. For those that do not want to go to twitter  [
Now I need to find a new multi coin HD wallet.

What you can do to support it is use the coin and encourage vendors to support payments in it. the more utility and acceptance the stronger the system will be.
@_date: 2019-02-26 17:46:28
On your phone get coinomi. It allows for many different coins to be accepted and in the receive portion you can input a price that should come over for the person paying.

If fees do not go up in total per block then difficulty will go down to maintain the same profit for miners.
There are two ways to increase the total fees per block.
1. Pay higher fees per Tx.
2. Fit more Txs in each block.

If BTC plans a hard fork they could always adopt the adjustment from BCH. It is a rolling avg of the last 144 blocks so about 24 hrs. 
Although I would like to see the way mining is handled change so the miners individually contribute hash to the network instead of using pools.

Lets make it a PPV event where only BTC is accepted to view.

My wife just shouts "What I can't hear you over the vacuum."  
*She refers to the miner as a vacuum because it sounds like one running nonstop and sucks electricity.  
As a side note she has taught several of the guys at her work about bitcoin when they were asking about it.

As a tourist it would be the same as for everyone. 
Insurance is billed and patient is billed for the remaining portion the insurance did not cover based on the terms of the contract for both the patient and the medical facility.  
If there is no insurance the patient gets a self pay discount. Some places give additional discounts if the bill is paid in one instillation. The patient is placed on a payment plan if cannot be paid in full.  
(Note) The self pay discount is closer to what the medical facility would charge if insurance would pay based on procedure and not billed amount. E.g. Insurance A will pay $100 and insurance B will pay $170, if they are billed $98 both pay only $98. I the medical facility bills $300 for the procedure they will get the full amount the insurance will pay and are told to write off (discount) the rest. 
The federal tax rate is  
Rate	Individuals  
10%	Up to $9,525  
12%	$9,526 to $38,700  
22% 38,701 to $82,500  
24%	$82,501 to $157,500...  
I only included the lower brackets.
There are other taxes like social security 6.2% paid by the worker and the same amount by the employer.   
Then states have different rates in KY is %2-6 income tax. On top of that there is a 6% sales tax, property tax, county and city taxes.

Instead of prioritizing low fees how about processing based on age. Use a first in first out, possibly with 10% of the transactions processed being the ones with the highest fees.
@_date: 2018-02-06 17:03:17
You think they will have users pay only the fee needed?
Good luck.
Most likely the fixed fee they use and almost all exchanges use will still be the same or slightly smaller but still more than sent. Why you might ask, to pocket the difference.
By batching and using segwit just increases how much they pocket.

* Kentucky.   
* Private sector maintains the roads, they are paid for by the county, except where the roads are privately owned like the two new bridges and part of the highway. Also several communities roads are privately maintained.  
* Healthcare is paid for by my private insurance, I'm not of medicaid.  
* Streetlights on my road the property owner pays for it if they want one, is cheap to get.  
* Water, for city water we pay for the infrastructure to get it to the curb, then we pay for the connection and pay for the usage.  
* Social support. There is plenty it comes from individuals and non-prophets. Later today I'm delivering a bed to a lady who cannot afford her own, the gov is not helping.  
* Trash service in every town I have lived in is paid for by the owner, some places it is required to be billed with water service.  
* We have police but I would rather pay for my volunteer firefighter service.  


In the US, your worldwide income is subject to U.S. income tax, regardless of where you reside. So if you leave and do not live the in US you still need to pay taxes there.

I'm assuming but I would think he has a VM set up and let it run filtering out the combos they he knew it was not. Then let it run saving every so often, so he would not have to restart after power out ect. Then gives priority to each VM based on total BTC and when it was requested. He probably has a script to notify him if a solution is found on any VM.

I would like for nodes to have to option to block empty blocks if the mem pool has more than 1mb in it.
Like with BU nodes were temporarily blocked due to the larger than 1mb block.
If enough nodes had this as an option and turned it on the empty blocks would not be distributed giving other miners time to mine a "real" block.

Yep and you can do your part by creating your own electricity and storing it. Add batteries later and a controller to only use the battery power during peak times. If you can move from flat rate billing.
