No, there is a difference between RECOMMENDATION (Carmen Segara) and what she found.

Yes, as long as they doesn't kill or shit all over us. What we/I ask is for people to understand that no man is a fucking island. What do you think about automatization and "excess people" as a growing problem? Do you think everyone are entreprenaurs?
Why would you have less choices when you have more time and access to stuff?

You don't think that you will be liberated by having robots do the boring repetitive jobs and not being forced to do something just for money? What ~~the~~ ~~f_ck~~ is your definition of libertä?
We need a new system which main focus lies on the well-being of the human species.

Eh what? Genocide and extinction? We are on the road to extinction now as we let money dictate over science. Machines and programs are taking over more and more work already and may help us come **closer** to a utopia. I'm open to all solutions.

Well, it's only a problem in a capitalistic society where work is necessary to live, as long as we care for the people that fall out it should be good.
The difference is that all our basic needs will be covered by an incredibly tiny fraction of people. Then why would we be forced to work to exist? In my head what I speak of is kind of like a techno-anarchy. People would do what they want to, including work on things they like. It seems like you want all that just without the robots?
Every system can be hijacked by bigots and Communism has showed itself very prone to that. They find their way in Capitalism too.

The propaganda is working I see or w~~h~~ere you joking? Socialism is when the workers own the means of production, or the state owns it. Socialism =/= welfare.

Patents and laws hinders progress yes. We need more forward thinking societal cooperation with logic and free flow of ideas. Moneymaking as a priority is a hinder to development. Making "jobs" should not be a priority, making a sustainable society should be, but this 20th century "YOU NEED A JOB" mentality is in the way.
It seems that people generally don't give a shit about the future though, and when these shallow, ignorant people vote it doesn't bring forth the best leaders.

Communism is about making sure everyone has a job and own the means of production. RBE is about freeing people from jobs to do what they want. Could you tell me about the similarities? What do you not like about them?

Well I would think one could do it with less than 100% of the world? You believe they can't accept even 90%? Hmm I will be more sceptical if this is the case.


This is not much different from an rbe?


Nothing hinders you to cooperate in an rbe.


Why would you not be able to do this??
