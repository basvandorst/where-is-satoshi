likely a scam

really sucks when your family member gained a massive debt in last 5 years without telling anyone, your home is on the line and you have to bet your lifesavings on 10x+ gains though

404 not found, I wouldn't ever tell anyone if I had earned any substantial amount of money for starters, for security reasons and because I don't think it's something you should be telling around generally

that's nothing, 10000 bitcoins get you 2 large pizzas

You can get up to 3% in my country, but I live in an eastern european country where living expenses are not so high.
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:15:44
those with that interest rate are usually few months only and sometimes have hard money cap, but if you to manouever around with many of those savings accounts you should be getting at least 2%, up to 3%

ah ok then, I assumed it was just a regular dude offering a trade outside the exchange which is a popular scam

wow, double cheese twice in a row, this guy must be dodging taxes

that's completely delusional, many people still haven't seen a computer in their life
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:46:34
trust me, I wouldn't, only thing that I would change is that I would order more toppings on my pizzas than usual

it's not about having a goal to live frugally, it's simply not turning into a fool who throws his money left and right and doesn't think about future, I can't imagine it being that hard
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:16:15
uhm why exactly would you change because of money?
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:16:45
are you implying that people can smell the money from distance?

Alright, I will give you that, I would definitely get myself a new gaming PC in range of $10k. It might be doubtful, but I'm a loner who's completely asocial (reddit being exception). I wouldn't want to get a house, it's just a bother to take care of it if you don't have a family, I don't care about cars in the slightest, don't even have a driving license, I don't use any drugs. I don't care about expensive clothes or watches or phones (I only buy new stuff when previous get completely unusable) I don't go on vacations since I was 6, I prefer to sit 24/7 in front of a PC gaming or programming. I literally can't see where I could spend a large amount of money or why would I do that.

some people, many have clearly defined goals
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:11:49
depends on the country, in mine $20k a year would be living lavishly
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:09:37
What's the problem with just putting the money on saving account and living from the interest? That's what I would do if I had earned $300k+

I could be if I was a millionaire myself, otherwise it's just envy.
