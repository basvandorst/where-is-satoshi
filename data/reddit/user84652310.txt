Bitcoin currently has 8 decimal points, at what market cap are micro-transactions not micro anymore?

agreed man, he seems to be such a nice guy! love his videos and especially how he edits them. he does a really good job at breaking down what's important and, in my opinion, knows how to make things stick.

I love that! Is a hard fork then an upgrade of the Bitcoin protocol that the majority has to agree on? Could parts of the network be 'left behind' with 8 decimal points?

what about a public/private ledger for cooking recipes?
let's say there is an app for sharing recipes. every member downloads the app to access the collection and to add their own ideas. so everyone that has the cooking app shares and maintains the entire database of recipes and adds their own to the chain. that way you would have timestamped proof of existence of your recipe and could claim 'royalties' or some sort of credit/ compensation for your creativity (this could also be the incentive). you could fork them, add or change, but always find reference to the original idea. it would need a fairly light version of proof of work to be efficient and run on a tablet. just an idea :)

so does it make sense to invest into bitcoin, if currency is just the first app?
