So bitcoin can actually be sound money it needs to be censorship resistent. Accomodating every retail purchase on chain sacrifices censorship resistence and destroy the value prop of bitcoin. 
All fiat currencies are amazing at being a medium of exchange (quite a lot of advance in tech deployed to make it so) but they're not sound money. Bitcoin shouldn't thrive for low fees, it should thrive for security, finality, censorship resistence. The rest is a bonus and shouldn't come at a cost of those properties.

RBF doesn't kill 0 conf. Gemini accepts 0 conf BTC for example...
You can, as a merchant decide to not accept RBF Bitcoin tx &amp; accept Bitcoin non-rbf TX ones without any issues.
Also the original client allowed any new tx to replace old ones. However this was disabled due to DOS issue and then fixed via opt-in RBF (since asking for a higher fee to replace a TX prevents any DOS)

It's not really about supporting the network, it's about being financially sovereign by not trusting the full node you connect to if you're using a light client, instead you can connect to (or directly use) your own full node which will have validated &amp; will validate all blocks.

@_date: 2017-12-20 16:47:05
That's false. Plenty of core devs are okay with block size increase as long as it's done safely and follow a peer review process. Look for yourself on their twitter account or on the bitcoin-dev mailing list.

Bigger blocks bring more scaling problems and aren't a solutions. All blockchains currently have same scaling issues.

As far as I understand Jihan partly owns bitmain which provides 70% of the mining hardware (don't have a source on that) out there (Antminers). Antiminers seem to be the best product to mine bitcoin on the market (best meaning higher hashpower for the same or smaller electricity consumption as other mining hardware).
In themselves antminers are not locked to a specific pool or bitcoin implementation so anybody could buy it and use it and mine bitcoin core (which lots of people did and do). However large miners are reliant on getting deals with bitmain in order to get cheaper hardware and have a more profitable business. Those deal can be seen as sort of a preferential treatment and Jihan has the power to decide who gets or doesn't get the deal (or how much the deal is worth). So if you're a large miner or a large pool oeprator and want some hardware, you have to play ball with Jihan.
Please anyone correct me if i'm wrong.

Yes but bumping it once risks splitting the network and having a 'bitcoin' branding war for just a 2x increase. At least make it so it's a yearly % increase maybe even an increase that can be activated or not every year depending on network status etc..
And if you're hard forking at least make some other fixes that require a hard fork: 
This way you can probably Hard fork with a very high majority of support of users and miners (and therefore businesses) while keeping most experienced developers engaged.
@_date: 2017-08-09 13:20:55
But doing a HF just to bump block weight once without a long term solution or any other improvements has a pretty shitty risk/reward ratio.

As a UK resident, I was able to sign up to **Gemini** and after 1 day they approved my KYC submissions (proof of addresses and passport picture if I remember correctly). However I did not try to buy yet. Sadly the currency only seems to be in **USD** so possible you'll incur a bank fee if you buy with a GBP or EUR based account/card (I know my bank does add a couple percent charge for non-GBP transactions...)
I managed to buy some bitcoin with **Coinbase** a couple days ago but because of their stupid KYC I somehow could only register an account in euro (If I remember correctly, since my passport has an address in a European country I had to register as resident of that country or they would consistently reject me...). But Coinbase fees are quite high and again you might get a non-GBP fee from your bank if you can't sign up with the same currency of the account/money you want to buy with.

Well focusing on commit activity might be a wrong metric. Focusing on issues opened resolved or merge request, diversity of contributers etc is probably better (but I'm sure core fares also better against BU for that as well). It's just number of commits can be easily inflated so on its own it's not a very reliable indicator of good and well maintained code.
@_date: 2017-08-20 19:33:33
Can we stop giving bcash air time? If anything the pump is great because it allows people to get more BTC and make 2x proponents miners leave real bitcoin chain early which makes the November potential HF more and more inconsequential.

Thanks! I looked into [cryptosteel]( wallet but sadly they seem to only have space for 96 characters which seems to short for the recovery words. Storing digitally unless on maybe another offline device seems also like a hacking risk :(
Regarding ledger, I also had to use my recovery key since upgrading the firmware actually resets the device so it definitely made me aware of the importance to note that shit down lol.

@_date: 2017-11-14 02:05:22
It's indeed not terrible depending on how much bigger we're talking about. Key is to keep it as small as possible because any increase in block size potentially hurts censorship resistance property. At the same time it should be big enough that users don't see very very expensive fees on chain making 2nd layer expensive to use as well.
Problem with bumping the block size is gaining consensus with businesses, users &amp; miners to do a safe hard fork. For example some people might think bumping is quite short term minded and a longer term solution might be needed (for example gradual increase every year). Also since Hard forks are lengthy to deploy, it might be interesting to add more into it than a simple block size increase a la spoonnet (or others) proposals: 
@_date: 2017-11-14 02:56:28
Proposal would need to be written, Consensus to be reached (approach all businesses and have them be okay with it unless fair technical argument, leave enough time for peer review/feedback from users/devs as well)
Finally it would need to be coded, tested and leave enough time for all stakeholders to deploy it safely. Basically anything that any other HF would need. 
Anyways I'd imagine 1.5mb (I guess meaning 6mb block weight) would never get consensus (some would say too low, some would say not worth a HF etc), and even if it did, it wouldn't go live for at least a year...
@_date: 2017-11-06 02:44:17
Open source development versus corporate driven goal that might take the codebase anywhere regardless of whether it's supported by data, science or facts.
&amp; also having that size with Schnorr signatures would mean it was optimised as much as currently possible/known &amp; can have as much throughput as possible in those 3.8MB making the sacrifices made in block propagation and node centralisation more palatable.
Also not sure where you got those 3.8mb from as in expected average with segwit is 2.1mb as far as i'm aware. Schnorr would allow to pack more TX into those 2.1mb though. With 2x however blocks can actually be up to 8mb with avg of 4.2mb, quite a contrast to ~4mb max without.

Covert ASICBoost didn't convince BU supporters, myriad of critical bugs in BU didn't convince them, the successful segwit activation on Litecoin won't convince them either and this certainly won't.

nobody said jihan has direct control to more than 50% hash power. 30%+ is enough to block anything he wants since it would be quite risky to have a Masf with &lt; 70% signalling threshold.
Plus even if he does have 50+% hash power under his control, would be very destructive for bitcoin to try a hard fork with less than a super majority...
@_date: 2017-04-28 08:03:30
The problem is core are developers. Their aim is to be developers and not politicians. Segwit should be adopted on its technical merit alone.
@_date: 2017-04-10 09:24:16
I think it was driving this conclusion from the number of BU blocks mined lately. Of course this was the wrong conclusion to draw since it's now back up and the drop was probably caused by a power plant outage which was one of the main provider of electricity of Bitmain mining farm (maybe also viaBTC)... Again showing how de-centralised antpool is :D
@_date: 2017-04-29 06:26:40

@_date: 2017-04-22 23:00:28
The scary part is that it's not only an incentive to block Segwit, it's an incentive to block anything that might touch the header of the block no matter how good it is for the protocol.
But don't worry, bitmain said they aren't using it for the good of bitcoin although it's built in their miners, they filed a patent for it and are defending both the use of ASICBoost and the patents.


Don't worry, since they don't use it for the good of the network, they will back a "counter-optimisation" i'm sure. Oh wait:


How can it be a loss for the patent owners if they won't use covert asic boost on the maint network? Do they sell the license to use it instead so they can continue saying: "We never used asicboost in **OUR** mining farms ?"
Btw the above quotes are taken from Bitmain official statement: 
To be fair, it's almost understandable from bitmain's point of view, after all they're a for profit company, it's just a big disappointment to see people (like r/btc) still supporting Bitmain and hailing covert Asicboost despite the above statements and the huge risk on the network. Even bitmain clearly imples that covert asicboost is not good for bitcoin in that statement. 
@_date: 2018-03-26 19:29:19
Of course I'm speaking of hypothetical since it hasn't happened yet...
Still theoretically bitmain who owns more than 500k Bch could have incentives of doing this since it doesn't brick their hardware and assumption that BCH could take over might make sense in their minds. 
Long term incentives might even make more sense since now the most valuable protocol would be almost entirely under their thumbs since they bankroll it's development as well. Could easily decide to implement changes beneficial to miners to the chain which would increase their profit long term.
Regarding the pool, I agree it would be great. p2pool might be the solutions but afaik it's less efficient than traditional pools in term of block propagation speed and also doesn't allow users who arent currently mining when block is found to get a reward (Might be talking out of my ass since it's been a while since I researched p2pools). But it makes sense that a centralised pool would propagate blocks with more efficiency to the rest of the network.
@_date: 2017-04-21 14:49:18
Doubt that's what Jihan wants since SW will still kill his covert AsicBoost.

They might want the price of Bitcoin to drop if they think it will make whatever other fork they own a shitload of go up. And asics won't be bricked either because they can also be used on the other chain.
You mention also pools are comprised of lots of individual miners/entities but do we actually know how much of that is bitmain affiliated or not? 
And also it ultimately doesn't matter as those individual entities might realise too late that their hash rate has been used to attack Bitcoin. And if this attack has led Bitcoin to lose in value and the other fork to gain then at that point their interest would be aligned with the pool operators (attackers) as well.

People that are actually hoping to kill BTC in favor of BCH have all interest to split the network again and therefore are still pushing for 2X even if they don't intend on supporting it in the long term. 
It's just a way to dilute network effect of BTC, hurt confidence in BTC, and make new comers more confused claiming BTC is a mess because it's splitting again so they should instead invest in BCH (like what roger ver tried to do with his bloomberg article).
@_date: 2017-09-19 14:17:06

Apparently because you don't want to put your money on those exchanges or because you don't trust the futures contract. Or maybe if the volume you want to trade is quite large compared to the futures order books.
Although IMO all those are poor excuses but it's what public s2x proponents or futures rate apologizers have used (like garzik).
@_date: 2017-10-29 17:59:50
People dismissing the future price as an indication of post-fork price often say that people just don't trust exchange X to deliver once the fork happens they wouldn't do it for any price on those exchanges. Well, with this offer they don't have to.
Roger accepted a 1:1 swap up to 1k coins. If you truly believe hash power signalling was king &amp; b2x will be the chain surviving (and getting 'BTC' ticker), why wouldn't you take 3 bitcoin to 1 offer? We're told that economic majority is behind this fork and yet the future price is where it's at &amp; offers like Adam's rarely find buyers (although generous if you really believe in 2x). Strangely I never see such offer coming for any 2x supporter (to be fair they're a rare breed).
@_date: 2017-10-14 20:08:56
And he gets shat on by 2x cheerleaders.

The block size is not limited to 1mb anymore... Theoritical max is 4mb and average should be ~2.1mb once Segwit is more widely used.
However all points stand for any further increase to block sizes.
@_date: 2017-10-07 23:20:31
I didn't berate or insult them. The agenda i'm pushing is to make them understand mining hash rate % is a shit way to determine what is BTC and that seems pretty obvious from my comments so I doubt they'd misunderstand it. I'd love for them to clarify what time frame they'd be looking it at though when talking about 90% hash rate, and also what chain they'll be looking at (90% of all sha256 mining, or only between BTC &amp; 2x - so not including BCH) etc. 
But in the end I know they won't because their definition of BTC will change soon after the fork when most hash rate goes back on incumbent chain and they won't want to flip back their ticker because their whole goal is probably to not run a client that miners don't have control of.
@_date: 2017-10-07 22:19:05
That's my point, so they'll assign ticker/bitcoin name to whoever has the majority of hash rate right? But majority for how long?


90% upon fork day? What happens if it dips the day or week after that, will they switch back?

Strongly disagree with a lot of this. Every major bitcoin core contributor has some part in the decision making that could end up blocking potential changes to the (Bitcoin Core client) codebase assuming they have valid concerns which cannot be fixed/proved unwarranted.
This doesn't fall on G.Maxwell more than any other more or just as active developers especially considering he doesn't have commit access (although commit access aka maintainers aren't really meant to approve/block changes unilaterally and instead are just there to verify the process/peer review/testing has been done &amp; is up to standards).
And finally, bitcoin is not bitcoin core or any specific client. Users can run several different client today to follow and validate the bitcoin consensus rules. 
It's the users of the network who decide what consensus rules they follow (and therefore what define Bitcoin). If a consensus rule change is introduced by developers or other actors into bitcoin core (or into other clients) and it doesn't have consensus of the users/economic nodes then it will never become part of bitcoin's consensus rules (see fiasco of 2x).
Also similar misconceptions with the power of miners: if they want changes and need to fork the chain for it, if no users/economic node follow them they'd have just created an altcoin - just like what happened with bcash).

Well since the attack didn't do any damage to bitcoin, not sure why would the community condemn it. better it happens now and make people realise BU is shit quality or alternatively motivates BU to figure out their testing issues rather than it happens after a fork (if a fork happens)...

No, segwit alone won't do that. However it does allow easier creation of Lightning Network which could cover that amount of transactions however are not as decentralised (but do you need decentralisation for buying a 2$ coffee from the same brand everyday?). 
Also worth noting that Segwit will allow easier deployments of further on chain scaling improvements like Schnorr signature.
Here is the bitcoin core scaling FAQ: 
Here is the scaling roadmap:
In that scaling roadmap you will see that core is not against raising the max block size but it should be done after other optimisations (because protocol optimisations mean higher transactions throughput without sacrificing decentralisation) :
    Finally--at some point the capacity increases from the above may not
    be enough.  Delivery on relay improvements, segwit fraud proofs, dynamic
    block size controls, and other advances in technology will reduce the risk
    and therefore controversy around moderate block size increase proposals
    (such as 2/4/8 rescaled to respect segwit's increase). Bitcoin will
    be able to move forward with these increases when improvements and
    understanding render their risks widely acceptable relative to the
    risks of not deploying them. In Bitcoin Core we should keep patches
    ready to implement them as the need and the will arises, to keep the
    basic software engineering from being the limiting factor.

@_date: 2017-05-25 14:32:46
segwit increase the block size but i guess that's not what you meant. If it's increasing the block size limit variable then it cannot come sooner than segwit since there is no client doing this that is up to date and has been thoroughly tested. Plus it required a hard fork which requires ALL actors to update to avoid split risks that would damage the trust in bitcoin &amp; the community. That would require much more time than simply segwit UASF or current bit 1 segwit MASF.
Segwit is the only tested solution that already has significant support which could be deployed if a pool operators put their ego in check and signaled for the UASF so it would go smoothly.

Agreed that the fact that BU does have some kind of community support shouldn't be ignored however I do think active users subreddit count is a very flawed metric. Also some people might support BU but are not anti-segwit either. Generally I see rational big blockers as being in that mind set (pro bigger block but not anti-segwit, possibly just wanting at the minimum a bigger block with segwit), then you get also the people that are for some reason anti soft fork and only want hard forks etc..
I don't think it's useful to categorising people as small blocker vs big blockers since there are a whole spectrum in opinions and someone can be a small blocker now in the sense that he wants segwit activated first before deciding to want bigger blocks or not.
However I think you can categorise people as Anti-BU vs Pro-BU and  Anti-Segwit vs Pro-segwit but being an active user of r/btc or r/bitcoin shouldn't be enough of a criteria to put you in any of those categories. That's a little bit like adding up twitter followers of big name proponent or opponent of a proposal to estimate support..
I like the user counts thought on slush but it's the only big pool as far as i'm aware that offers this voting functionality also it probably is biased like you said since slush is publicly anti-bu which might put off a segment of miners. Also miners are a very specific segment of users that could have a bias itself to either proposal (although imo probably more towards BU as it gives more power to miners).
You also miss a lot of the [company support/readyness where segwit has an overwhelming advantage]( as well as [node counts]( (which is of course in itself not an accurate metric but none of the other ones are either) and also possibly polls like the one that [was done by 21](

Why would blockstream Dev have contributed to segwit if they were against scaling ? Segwit allows easier Dev of LNs which directly compete with sidechains like these. Point is blockstream is pro bitcoin and that's it, they innovate in the space in there own tech and they help innovate in bitcoin too since their tech is based on bitcoin's success.
Why would they risk bitcoin being displaced since their whole business rely on it?

except the increase hashpower mostly came from btc.top &amp; antpool so basically only bitmain. However i'm not disagreeing regarding the relevance of it. I do think it should be talked more about either by encouraging it (to make BU fork off and BTU a thing) or to continue pushing for a UASF.

'Their own peer review' yeah because that's what bitcoin open source software is about .

I want segwit like most of the companies that sign the agreement. 
Not working for a bank, just a dev and bitcoin user that would like improvements made to the protocol (allowing off chains, confidential transactions and general growth of the network) instead of updated that would prevent me from running my node and verifying my transactions.

How did roger contribute to anything except his own wallet? I appreciate his early work to spread around the word about bitcoin but that's it and there's nothing smart about any of that.
People like Adam and of course Satoshi actually contribute to the world by innovating. Look at what Roger is doing now: cloud mining and using bitcoin.com domain to just generate more money. He never contribute any technological advance to bitcoin. Blockstream on the other hand has.
@_date: 2017-05-17 16:26:04
I'd still disagree with bundling them. Segwit is tested, a bundle would have to be re-tested again and won't get the benefit of a litecoin test bed. One after the other makes much more sense. And if segwit had been activated 8 months ago when it was already ready we could already be there. But people now being against a segwit activation because it's not enough strangely weren't there 8 months ago when it would have been fine and would have allowed scaling BIPs built on Segwit.

It's a big deal because it's very confusing. Some companies understood this compromise as segwit+2mb hf all in one. While Barry seems to advocate segwit MASF now and 2mb HF within 12 months which makes more sense.
Question is what do those miners support? Segwit now without a 2mb HF? I'm quite skeptical about it...

It doesn't. It's already hitting too high gas fees.
@_date: 2017-05-13 23:48:33
Nobody ever promised segwit +8mb. Even if someone actually makes it, it'll never reach consensus... 8mb is way too much of a first step and one of the main goal of segwit was to get capacity increase without requiring a hard fork. What's the point of bundling it with a 8mb hard fork? If more capacity is needed after segwit then the correct amount can be studied and proposed, it's nonsense to do that before segwit is activated.
@_date: 2017-05-18 09:44:00
AXA doesn't have anything to do with the roadmap of Blockstream. It's their venture arm that invested in the startup. The are insurer, investing in a bitcoin business would allow them to make money on the back of technology that might disrupt other part of their business.  Plus you seem to conflict AXA with a bank. Their bank makes them very little money compared to their core businesses and they're not big FX traders like all the other banks. This is a conspiracy theory with no basis in fact.
However it's VC company (backed by Axa), as any VC company their goal is to make ROI on their investors money. They do that by investing in start ups that have potential, not by fucking with the technology that gives that start up the potential...
They invested in quite a lot of company. Strategic Venture is a good PR move, not some kind of illuminati bildelberg conspiracy.

Core broke it by not signing the agreement (only a couple Devs did) and also forcing f2pool to signal classic which broke the agreement ? And also broke it by actually releasing block increase BIPs that nobody in the miner community supported even though it was increasing blocks? And also broke it now although segwit is a block size increase? 
@_date: 2017-05-22 10:19:17

How does a soft fork keeps them in control of bitcoin more than a hard fork?
They don't want a hard fork like most people because hard forks guarantees a chain split since it requires everybody to upgrade. It's risky on a network as big as bitcoins where so many company and users rely on it not introducing breaking changes.
@_date: 2017-05-18 07:47:14
Horribly unclear. Barry mentions segwit then a HF within 12 months which does have some sense but Erik &amp; Pair seem to think it's segwit + 2mb at the same time meaning a hard fork is required and that doesn't make any sense...

Absolutely agree but scaling main chain doesn't necessarily mean bumping block size although it might need to come to that. If it does &amp; it requires a Hard fork I sure hope the HF can do more than simply bumping the Blocok Size / block weight by 2...
@_date: 2017-05-17 15:21:35
He doesn't say he is against UASF in this tweet. Being for a segwit UASF and also for a hard fork is not mutually exclusive, it just means you want any scaling ASAP.
@_date: 2017-05-26 19:33:30
Because they think blockchain &amp; bitcoin are a potentially good platform for a successful company?
Plenty of banks (although AXA is not a bank like goldman sachs or JPM), and other big companies invest in start up but it's not to guide the roadmap or micro manage the company wtf. AXA is just an insurer with enough capital and contact to have a Venture Capital fund. It's a PR move saying "we believe in the future, we're cutting edge technology" instead of trying to fight it.
If you invest in a start up, you don't go around fucking up the market that the start up is basing its success on, that doesn't make any sense.
Edit: where is the outrage that Bank of Tokyo lead an investment round in Coinbase? Nowhere because it's completely irrelevant.

They circumvented peer review and by doing so proposed something not technically accurate/feasible. 
This sub responds by saying this is not a well thought out proposal, same way as if it had been proposed by anyone else. Shouldn't matter who proposed it, only thing that matters is how good for the network/protocol it is. This is just  pandering to politics and big CEOs when bitcoin should be about tech.
But maybe it's salvageable if actual bitcoin Devs work on making it a technically sound proposal.
@_date: 2017-05-23 19:14:32
I think core needs to get on this. It's the only way to get a quality client that does what the agreement sait it would do (segwit and then 2mb) while being compatible with current segwit deployment methods... Only way to make the best out of a pretty shitty situation. 
@_date: 2017-05-17 12:11:02
But users want Segwit &amp; better offchain and that was coded in and still not in. Users probably will want more scaling than segwit offers but can't be coded in since segwit isn't activated yet.

woudn't have been too late if miners activated it when it was ready (last november).
We could even have schnorr signatures by now and possibly a hard fork as well if no better scaling solutions were found. 
@_date: 2017-05-31 16:02:36
Because Bitcoin is money. Ethereum's is for smart contracts but up to know i see no value added except for creating ICOs...
Ethereum is centralised and does not scale well. Supposed to move to POS, supposed to have sharding, supposed to solve a lot of things that up to now havent really been solved.
A lot of the current value comes from insane marketing and pump promoting it as web 3.0 which makes no sense.
However I DO think Ethereum is cool and the tech is really interesting. Doesn't mean that it's a currency like Bitcoin is.
@_date: 2017-05-28 17:51:48
Maybe because r/btc arguments are only about blockstream and axa and bildenberg and whatnot which kind of invalidates any points they're trying to make.
@_date: 2017-05-02 09:34:36
comparing active sub users for support is stupid. Plenty of people go on both sub but don't agree with BU (or alternatively Segwit).
The best you can do is node counts and company supports/readyness for segwit as well public profiles support (although these obviously don't mean anything compared to actual company readyness/support) Both of that show a majority in favor of rolling out Segwit (however it does not mean they aren't also in favor of bigger blocks, just like most core devs do, lots of people favor segwit &amp; bigger blocks).
@_date: 2017-07-01 13:41:17
More appeal to authority which is the only 'argument' that supports bullshit like this. His whole blog post trying to convince he had signed a message with satoshi's key was a scam. No coming back from that whoever says he is satoshi. 
And everything he did after that post confirmed he was a scammer (filing hundreds of patents related to blockchain, going around claiming bitcoin nodes can be centralised and should only mining nodes should fully validate etc..). He is a scammer and anyone giving him credibility is either one as well or a dumbass.

@_date: 2017-05-17 15:26:34
Why would it be quicker or more acceptable? You still have to test a block bump, you also have to decide on a scientifically based increase. And it's still a hard fork so you would have to manage to get everybody to upgrade which would take months.
Segwit is tested &amp; ready now, if miners signal it could be activated in a month which would be faster than any hard forks.
@_date: 2018-04-26 00:53:51
Me too, enjoy :)
@_date: 2017-05-24 08:23:06
They did because the agreement was signed with technical component to it (HF activated at date X, with max block size Y, segwit signalling on bit Z), those components should have been determined AFTER peer review. You're talking about companies saying "I will run this non-existing piece of software with changes making effects that haven't been studied or peer reviewed". This doesn't make much sense.
I'd understand it if the software existed, was open source already &amp; could be improved based on peer review and was ready before making any company sign (and yes some [company felt force to sign]( 
This is reckless.
And for sure they might develop a non-Core bitcoin client. But you seem to forget that peer review &amp; "vetoes" are in place for a reason, to not allow shitty code into the client that used by most of users/companies/miners.
    
    It doesn't mean the code wouldn't be tested. It doesn't even mean that people like Luke-jr or nullc couldn't give their views and feedback on the code.
If that is true then I'm all for it, however they asked companies to sign before any formal process was in place in regard to the solution, but that formal process should have been part of the agreement.
For the record I don't care what devs work on it as long as they are competent and there are enough of them.
@_date: 2017-05-24 21:20:23
And yet 95% of the nodes run their software and they implemented segwit so they might have been a good source of knowledge regarding a segwit deployment... But don't let me get in the way of politics with technical arguments .

NOT a hard fork. Chain split yes but doesn't have to be a permanent one so not a hard fork.
@_date: 2017-07-04 13:01:18
Doesn't force anything onto anyone. Not only is SW backwards compatible and opt-in but you don't have to use the chain resulting from the soft fork if you don't want to (if the economic majority and therefore hashrate doesn't end up supporting the 148 chain then you wouldn't risk wipeout right?).
No segwit proponent wants a 'digital gold' otherwise they wouldn't support segwit since segwit allows proper scaling by making LN easier to develop and use and allowing improvements like schnorr signature. As opposed to simply throwing more computational power at the problem by just doing bigger blocks hoping it fixes everything (it won't).
@_date: 2017-05-14 21:45:18

A few loud voices are against segwit activation: viaBTC, Jihan, Roger all advancing false arguments (that segwit is a backdoor by core devs, or double spends risk or that axa being an investor in blockstream and blockstream having core devs means that segwit is a banking deep state conspiracy...) Sine core developed Segwit, some people don't want it because adopting it will legitimise core. Some people are against it purely for political reasons.

One large insurance company was lead investor. Far cry from "funded by large banks".
Not to mention a lot of bitcoin start ups get money from venture arms of banks (Softbank, goldman sachs etc..). Doesn't mean any of those institutions have some kind of nefarious agenda towards bitcoin that they'd implement in any of those startups.
@_date: 2017-05-12 12:13:01
That doesn't make any sense. They spend a lot of time on developing a solutions then they spend a lot of time on further improvements also based on that solution but they don't actually want it live?
95% was set because devs were assuming it would get wide spread support since Segwit is a no brainer improvement-wise since it fixes malleability issue &amp; increase block size (among other improvements)....
They could have put a threshod of 75% like litecoin &amp; it wouldn't have mattered since bitmain would also be able to prevent the threshold to be reached.

Firstly being a big blocker does not mean supporting EC.
Secondly you can't add up the hash rate of EC with the other non-segwit scaling proposal since it's the same blocks signaling them and BW signalling 8mb blocks doesn't mean they support BU/EC either or won't support segwit in the future (like they do on litecoin)

If it never reorgs the main chain, you still have the coins on the legacy chain even if 148 'dies'. That's why there is way less risk of using 148 chain than legacy one since 148 cannot be wiped out and if it dies out you still wouldn't have lost any coin from legacy chain.

I do agree that BIP148 is aggressive, however for a lot of users it looks like it might be the necessary step to get a protocol improvement through quickly. BIP149 activation timeout is July 2018 and that's a long way to go potentially. Also it will not get implemented on main net before this November. On the other hand if the BIP-148 UASF is successful then we could have segwit this August.

Or you could just be neither. If Roger doesn't understand bitcoin enough to know it wasn't even close to being an ICO then maybe he shouldn't tweet shit about things he doesn't understand.
But I'm pretty sure he knows he's being innacurante and does it on purpose, IMO he just wants to legitimise ICOs and other shit concept like premine &amp; founders rewards. Wouldn't be surprised if he promotes any one of those in the future. Time will tell.

He didn't make any argument that hasn't been debunked several times by now (anyone can spend, legal bullshit, patents etc..).

It's baseless and just shows nchain has no idea what bitcoin is.. That plus the fudpiece Craig has been putting out lately proves they are pretty threatened by core &amp; segwit which makes sense since they are making their own client (and have said they won't open all their parents)
@_date: 2017-07-02 10:24:02
None of that ever happened...
@_date: 2017-07-02 17:03:31
Ah yes misread. So until there is a wipeout or 148 dies the only way to be safe is not to receive money. That's true whether you stay on legacy or 148 so again don't have higher risk on 148 than legacy. Also as long as 148 has enough hash rate to get to a difficulty change, you can be confident it won't die out either.
Additionally, If the hashrate not signaling segwit (viabtc, bitmain etc) do their miner activated hard fork, bip 148 would probably wipe out legacy.
@_date: 2017-07-02 16:43:13
Why? Doesn't matter if it reorgs it or not since main chain cannot wipeout 148 chain.

That's why everybody wants lower fees. But there are still plenty of cases where bitcoin is useful 100$ fees or not it doesn't lose its trustless property and censorship resistance.
No bitcoin user wants to pay 100$ fees but in the end it would still be used (at least until it gets displaced by something that scales better and is as decentralised and trustless)
@_date: 2017-06-30 12:32:17
do you really support Craig Wright in such statements &amp; believe he is Satoshi?

who? Except maybe all bitcoin holders who'd profit from having higher bitcoin prices post-segwit.

Yup, agreed.

[Classic had plenty of issues]( Also it took a while to get that code in a functional state &amp; to test it correctly and yet it still failed to get consensus after (not even talking miner consensus), very few node adopted actually ran it.
You can't just copy paste code from classic. The deployment mechanism is different for Segwit2X (also core source code that it's based on is not as it was).
@_date: 2017-06-08 08:31:24
Seriously you guys need to learn to read and see the context. He's just saying bitcoin transactions are valuable enough that some people would pay up to 100$ to get in a block. That does seem like it could be the case indeed. If you have a 5 times increase in price tomorrow what do you think will be the fee if you want to be sure you're in the first block during a high traffic day?
He never said he wants 100$ fees...
@_date: 2017-06-16 10:03:35
Hard to trust they'll follow through on signaling Segwit2x if they woudn't even implement Segwit in their own fork. Why wouldn't they just delay segwit2x signalling until UASF happens to justify hard forking and in the end never implement segwit on their fork (although like you said, if their fork has no support it will be useless anyways)? 
@_date: 2017-06-08 12:04:05
A first step solution is already there: Segwit.
I don't see how it's not smart, he's stating in the tweet: 
    still be really good if fees were much lower
Anybody seemingly misinterpreting his tweet to say he is okay with 100$ fees is doing it on purpose and therefore is only interested in conflict and would never advocate for a resolution in the first place.
@_date: 2017-06-03 10:52:23
    You don't need any testing or anything for a simple 2MB blocksize increase.

:Core' never said that, most core Devs are for bigger blocks. [The core scaling roadmap]( was [signed even by Luke]( and mentions raising blocks after other optimisations have been deployed.

Not surprising coming from ethereums pumping subreddit but none of what's in that post actually proves that it's most secure. It's just saying more $money is given to miners everyday in eth at current price (at least if you exclude tx fees). 
@_date: 2017-06-08 11:54:37
I don't see at all how this tweet is wrong. Anyone that isn't ill-intentioned can see he is not advocating higher fees. The only people thinking and spreading that's what he meant are people with an agenda to make him look bad. People with half a brain will see it for what it is. 
@_date: 2017-06-24 16:19:54
Well core software is still run by the vast majority of users and even bigger majority of economic nodes. 
Also the fact that actually Luke's proposal wasn't that laughable since it was even mentioned as an example of hard fork on chain capacity increase in the btc1/ repo discussion.
The point of a proposal is to build on it, not to be law, and nobdy cared enough to do that. There was no interest for any hard forks that anybody from core proposed, because the role was always to try to replace core with anybody that would cater to Bitmain &amp; co's interests.
@_date: 2017-06-01 07:57:54
Thought this was satire but not sure. Any arguments towards that point?
@_date: 2017-06-29 21:31:51
Bitmain's pools &amp; their friends do that yes (btc.top, antpool, btc.com, viabtc &amp; bitcoin.com).
@_date: 2017-06-07 17:59:18
Bitmain has lots of leverage due to its position as the leading ASIC manufacturer.
Bitmain also owns several mining pool (ConnectBTC, Antpool &amp; BTC.com) it also was the lead investor in [ViaBTC's A round](
So yeah: 1=&gt;mining centralisation is already an issue, 2=&gt;ASICboost does/will only exacerbate this issue.

    Why don't they spend some of it to safeguard their business, hire more developers and put more $$$
Getting competent bitcoin developers is not that easy. Rare resource which is not that interested in $$$.

Making it safe requires NOT expediting the process since peer review is a necessary part to get anything remotely safe and it takes time.
@_date: 2017-06-24 16:14:21
Core didn't AND CAN'T sign shit as a group since it's an open source repo where anybody can contribute. Some core Devs did and followed through by proposing hard forks that miners didn't give a fuck about. Not mentioning that miners broke agreement by running other clients in the first place.
 In the end segwit got bundled with a capacity increase that could be deployed as a soft fork and still wasn't enough for some miners because they were never interested in an agreement or in any capacity increase, they only wanted a hard fork for pure on chain capacity increase and nothing else. And now spend most time funding competing clients that break consensus rules because they don't understand what is an open source project.
Bitmain promised several time to run segwit but never followed through or always changed the goal post.

The part where he posted a blogpost supposedly signing something with satoshi's private key but actually didn't sign shit.

Since BTC.com is owned by Bitmain, I am surprised they're not signalling yet.

Don't know who wrote it for Bitmain but :
'Gregory Maxwell’s recent proposal suggests changing 2^32 collision to 2^64 collision to make ASICBOOST more difficult. The result of this would be a loss for the patent owners and the Bitcoin protocol. The patent owners will get nothing and Bitcoin protocol will become more complicated. The only beneficiary will be the technical bureaucrats who are engineering it. '
This is pretty deflective and clearly defends ASICboost.
@_date: 2017-06-30 12:47:31
Well IMO there are several layers of bad actors in bitcoin. In my mind Craig Wright is definitely one of the worst people in the ecosystem: a scammer that tried to pass himself as satoshi to save himself from bankruptcy and now is continuing his scam. And he can only do that because of support of people that give him or gave him credibility (including gavin &amp; roger, Matonis etc). 
If that support goes away maybe the few that still believe he's not a fraud because they follow those authorities will realise their mistake.
@_date: 2017-06-13 13:19:02
You'd need a client that will implement this segwit + 2mb, not much point in signalling it otherwise.
@_date: 2017-06-18 09:59:54
Rather: if expert builder volunteers built free houses for thousands of people and continued making improvements to it. 
Then a couple of those people that never volunteered for anything, don't have much credibility as a builder, and made money all those years from those free houses started to say they know how to built better houses. Then they say those volunteers should somehow be fired (even though you can't really block them from improving the house of other people or building new ones because you know, they're volunteers)?
Building house is obviously the wrong analogy here, but you chose it.

This would definitely show some good signs. However in the end Bitmain can just delay for two weeks their signalling and make sure a chain split happens on august 1st to trigger their own premined HF.
@_date: 2017-06-11 22:26:56
The code is open source, you can check what's in it. And there are always other node implementations. Plus core development is not centralised since hundreds of Devs work on it and they don't all live in the US and certainly the majority of them don't work for blockstream.
@_date: 2017-06-08 12:58:45
Centralisation is not an abstract threat. Governance centralisation, miner centralisation, or not being able to run validating nodes can 
 (and does) greatly affect security.
    Personally, I just don't find a coin which is only useful for black market settlements to be interesting enough. It's too small of a niche.
Doesn't seem like it ever will be bitcoin's nice since bitcoin is terrible for privacy (at the moment).
@_date: 2017-06-02 12:57:18
The whole point of BIP-148 UASF is to get miners to mine Segwit blocks whether it's by making the MASF segwit attractive or by incentivising them to mine segwit blocks post 1st August due to difference in prices (assuming it will be a positive difference of course).
@_date: 2017-06-30 11:26:23
The problem isn't as much miner centralisation for such an increase (although it is one). Problem is trying to drive bitcoin development through politics instead of scientific process w/ peer review. 
And also trying to force people to hard fork to something that isn't needed. At least if you want people to fork with you, make the HF more than just kicking the can down the road scaling wise. What's the point of creating a permanent chain split for a 2x?
@_date: 2017-06-30 15:32:11
Gavin did say he could have been fooled:
    It’s certainly possible I was bamboozled.
And Roger, I don't think he would have cared whether or not craig was satoshi as long as craig can help him achieve his goal (money, control over the protocol etc.. same reasoning for jihan)
@_date: 2017-06-19 19:10:49
It's the only one. Makes it good relatively compared to no compromise but it's still pretty shitty in term of HF timeframe. Lots of wishful thinking by segwit2x signers on that front.

86% aren't signaling for segwit2x activation and they are not 'on segwit2x'. Only bitclub is actually signalling the right bit for segwit2x (and they're not running segwit2x either since software isn't finished ). The rest are simply showing support for the 'NYA agreement' which may or may not translate in segwit2x signalling in the future when software is finished.
@_date: 2017-06-30 15:57:19
Well apparently Gavin isn't that smart (or not all the time). Craig is a professional scammer, not only dumb people get scam but IMO only dumb people continue believing someone's satoshi after showing he is a scammer. Plenty of smart people debunked craig's 'signature' shitshow:

That doesn't make much sense. Assuming BS here is for Blockstream: that company does not control the protocol or what rules get enforced. Furthermore they are proponent of scaling solutions like segwit, schnorr &amp; side chains that would help bring those fees lower.
What makes you think people at blockstream want to have everyone paying $100 fees per TX?
@_date: 2017-06-08 11:57:48
