I aint no expert but a quick google search of gold price history shows alot of drops in the 80's a 20% drop in 97 . Bitcoin is young very young and its new technology and new ideology evrybody in crypto is on unexplored grounds atm so yeah its a bit unstable .

a bit pricy but i think so are all the others they took a week to verify me and yes took a few attempts to manage to get em to accept my card but now its easy peasy ive paired up the app on phone and i buy btc through it in seconds so far im satisfied with them they also have a sell option that ive not tried but id like to know more about
