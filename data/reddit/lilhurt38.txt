Lol. We’re not getting anywhere close to $8k. I may have been a little off on calling the bottom, but we’re gonna see a massive bounce within the next 48 hours.

Meh, the faster it drops the less I have to wait for the next leg up. Look how fast it’s dropping . That’s not sustainable. It’s going to hit its bottom soon and we’re gonna get an absolutely massive bounce.

15 minute chart for the day. Earlier we had a big jump straight up in price and it has been a diagonal shape down and to the right most of the day, which is your standard bull flag shape. If you look at the 1 hr chart, we’ve been forming bull flags since we hit the bottom at around $9.5k.

Damn, I sold cause I was expecting Bitcoin to drop back down to 9.5k for a double bottom and I could pick up some more Bitcoin. Bad news is that I lost a little bit of Bitcoin. The good news is we’re probably done dropping.

Meh, give it a few more hours. We already jumped $100.
@_date: 2019-08-16 18:54:10
We’ll be at 11k by tonight.

Did you miss the part where I said I sold cause I thought it’d double bottom at 9.5k and I wanted to pick up some more Bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-08-16 17:37:27
Lol. We just double bottomed. We’re not going back down.

We’re forming a cup and handle.
@_date: 2019-08-16 19:23:54
I’m already betting on it by not selling.
@_date: 2019-08-17 01:10:29
We’ve been forming a massive bull flag for most of today. We’re about to get a nice jump in the price within the next couple of hours.
@_date: 2019-08-14 01:57:59
Naw, we’re about to bounce hard off of 10,500. We just formed the handle part of a cup and handle.
Edit: And we just hit a double bottom at the bottom of the handle. I’ll see you guys at 20k in a couple of weeks.
@_date: 2019-08-19 02:40:01
If this shit hits 10500 and drops back down again I’m gonna be so annoyed.
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:53:47
We’re gonna hit bottom at about 7500 and start our next leg up

Big ol’ bear trap
