On the contrary, the spread of autonomy is a serious problem that must be addressed.

People with autonomy have the ability to do things without having to ask anybody else for permission. For instance, they can execute a plot to fly stolen airliners into tall buildings. Therefore, the NYDFS's regulations are absolutely necessary to prevent the proliferation of autonomy. 
People must be kept dependent upon employers for their sustenance. You can't cause any trouble if you're only one paycheck away from your life being turned upside down. Any avenue that allows people who are not already wealthy to accrue large amounts of wealth must therefore be blocked off.
Those employers, in turn, must be kept dependent on bankers who can be trusted not to allow any actions that We, the powerful business interests that control Western society, would find undesireable.
We at Coin Validation™, LLC are committed to stamping out Bitcoin's potential to spread autonomy.

Creating elegance and beauty is fine, as long as it's done obediently and with permission from the proper authorities. The only thing worse than people doing awesome things without permission is people making money doing awesome things without permission.
