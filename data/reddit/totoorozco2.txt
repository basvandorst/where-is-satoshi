Authy is quite hackable and it's not recommended. It is linked to your phone number, which has been easy to steal in the past.

Right! Because of that bitcoin hasn't been volatile at all lately...
@_date: 2018-09-02 21:02:28
It is worthless because of the number of units. Our president prints money like a toilet paper factory.

Nothing that happens in my country has any logic. He has offered to open "mining University" in broadcast TV. They contradict themselves every day.

I think it is more observable when you travel above the ocean or above flatlands.

I created a Twitter bot that pulls the price from CMC and localbicoins and publishes the ratio (dollar/VEF). Please check it out and give it a follow:

Hold my beer,  I am a geophysicist. I can tell you that the data that we observe (like gravimetric and seismic) closely fits the model of an ellipsoid. If the Earth was a thin plate, the gravimetric response would be very variable (instead of a quasi constant acceleration constant of 9.8m/s^2). 
The arrival time of the earquake events closely matches the path coming from the ellipsoid model (almost spherical). 
Also, I have been lucky enough to travel by plane and observe the curvature of the Earth.

I am from Venezuela (living abroad) and I can tell you btc is the best way to send money home. There is a huge market (by Venezuelan standards) at localbicoins.com 
@_date: 2018-05-19 14:26:00
I pull the USD/btc price from coinmarketcap and the VEF/btc rate from localbicoins, the I tweet the ratio: (VEF/btc)/(USD/btc)

I see they have a RESTful API, it should not be hard. I think an Intuit crypto plugin would have a good market

I told you: because they are dirty as f*ck. The day Maduro and the chavistas fall, everybody should be put in jail. Also, they have been brainwashing everyone during the "good years" for this time.

I am telling you man, this is a 20+ years cancer that has been slowly spreading. This is the job of very smart bad people.
We have fought so much, so many people has died protesting against the government...

What happened in  Venezuela was a perfect storm. Decades of political disappointment were met by a popular autocrat that got democratically elected.
The government party slowly but steadily grabbed all power branches while also having support of the military. 
A 100+$ oil barrel financed an unsustainable populist agenda for many years.

Chávez himself was militar. He lead a coup d'etat in the early 90's. 
First thing he did when he was elected was to give political rights to the military and politicized every body. 
Quickly into his presidency, he retired every general that was against him and promoted every mid rank that was with him. 
Also, he brought the Cuban know-how experience of how to stay in power at all cost. They put in jail anyone that was against them. 
These days the military control the drug dealing and contraband. The government lead everybody to get into any dirty business if they wanted as long they supported them. 
I guess the main reason is that it would encourage this collective immoral and corrupt group to maintain the status quo at all cost because otherwise they would be sent to jail as well.

Well dude, the price of the goods factor the transaction cost and the hardware cost of conventional banking system. If they give you 1% is because the are taking more than 1%from you...
MetalPay will disrupt the cash back market BTW, take a look at it.
@_date: 2018-06-15 03:09:06
I understand all that. All I am saying is that if they give you 1% it is because they're making more than 1% from you. They are not mother Teresa

Oh yeah? Fuck you. You cannot be a supporter of Venezuela and Maduro at the same time. Choose one
