Good to know, first time I’ve heard of it, I like the idea of be able to use it with my phone and good to see more options when it comes to hardware wallets.

Oh fuck! The super mutant I got them from told me bottle tops were the real bottle caps :/

Allegedly in large amounts of cash without doing any KYC and is now facing a maximum of 40 years in prison :(

No problem I’ve filled my bags with bottle tops.

And yet there are constant posts here of people doing just that and then asking how they use Bitcoin, a lot of people jump in and then figure it out after, I did :)

No capital gains tax needs to be paid in Germany if you’ve held the Bitcoin for over a year.

I like the cut of your jib son, pay me the fee from now on and I’ll take care of everything for you!

Bitcoin can’t be censored, you’re thinking of social media ie reddit, FB etc.
@_date: 2019-04-05 16:34:32
Correct, if blocks become to big only institutions will run nodes
@_date: 2019-04-09 18:14:28
Give me all your Bitcoin, problem solved.
@_date: 2019-04-06 14:32:07
Doh! I’m the dick it’s censoring then :/
Edit: I take it back, Rogers picture would be more fitting.

Bitfinex already provide this service, so not sure why you would need to use whalelend as a middle man, I’d say avoid them, sounds like a scam.

Why is it a shock, because it’s normally the right wing that have opinions like that? Seriously though I believe Che called homosexuals “sexual perverts” but from looking there seems to be a lot of conflicting views on the subject, were you referring to a particular source? be good to see it, it was an interesting point in history.

They’ve also upset people with some of the choices they’ve made but considering their corporate nature it’s hardly surprising, they have essentially become a Bank, the irony is that it’s a major on-ramp for new people which hopefully quickly learn they need to gain control of their Bitcoin, they are a weak link but they are not a scam like some people claim but they care more about their investors/profit than they do about Bitcoin.
