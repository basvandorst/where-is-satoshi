Putting any amount of money in an unsecured, unregulated cryptocurrency is gambling. It's unfortunate they lost the money, yes, but that's how the game works.

i'm not sure if this is possible, just an idea: anybody know of a way a simple chart or scrolling price banner thingy could be put in the sidebar for this sub? i know that all the charts vary, but maybe the mods could decide on a reputable chart or a marquee with all the exchanges/rates in the sidebar. I think it would be cool to see the price changes, etc. as i'm browsing along this sub. I have 0 knowledge of how this could be done, if at all, so I'm merely posting an idea

yeah that's rough. unfortunately all you can do is wait, so don't let it bother you, just check regularly to make sure everything is in order. You can put a fraud alert on your credit file, which will prevent someone from opening new accounts in your name.

Go check this out guys! Just sat down with Ryan, really cool dude. Keep up the good work man!

Oh yeah the folder is hidden, gotta use command+shift+g. Glad it worked out for you, hopefully you don't have to wait too long for the block chain to finish importing. Took me about 6 days on a 2010 MacBook Pro. Make sure to backup your computer after though because it's a very intense 6 days for your HD

It seems like everyone wants crypto currency to be unregulated, not controlled by a central government, and as soon as shit hits the fan "uh oh we need some government here to help us get our money back."

I use Mac so I can't speak for Linux/windows. In your bitcoinQt folder there's a folder called "Application Support". Drop it in that folder, you don't need to create any folders. When you open the qt application it should have a loading bar at the bottom and say something like "loading blocks from disk". I'm on mobile right now but PM me if you still can't get it and I'll send you more in depth stuff when I get home

This is like saying rich people should give gamblers in Vegas back all of the money they lose by gambling. If losing money to Gox is life-ruining, they should have a) not gambled money they weren't willing to lose and b) not let an incompetent exchange hold that money
@_date: 2014-02-28 15:53:59
I have the opposite train of thought. In my opinion an investment should have about 50% chance win/loss and a gamble should be 10/90 or less. I wouldn't invest if I thought I had 10/90chances, but sometimes taking that kind of gamble can be fun

Your legal fees will cost more than 0.3 BTC. And I'm not sure a court will do anything unless your ID is actually stolen/compromised. I would use whatever money you plan to need for a lawsuit and instead make sure your ID is safe. Get your free credit reports, close all related accounts, change all related passwords, store some emergency funds in the case someone does get into any of your accounts.
And remember (assuming USA), everyone is entitled to one free credit report from each of the 3 agencies each year. So get one every 4 months and make sure to report any fraudulent activity. Keep all of your financial records safe, so in the event that you are compromised, the court will then be able to support you. But I don't think suing right now will get too far

Download the qt client. When it first opens it will sync with the network (can take DAYS) to fully sync, a faster way is to download the bootstrap file from block chain and sync using that. The client will create a wallet for you, but it is very resource intensive on your HD so you may want to look for alternative wallets

I think my email may have just been pulled from a mailing list. I'm the first of my friends (that I know of) to show any interest in BTC, and I've never heard of the person I received the referral from. A google search suggests he's most likely in Florida, I'm 2500 miles away.
@_date: 2014-03-01 03:48:35
Find your bitcoin folder, drop bootstrap.dat into the folder, start bitcoinQt and wait

Its gunna cost you more than its worth for a lawsuit to get back 1 BTC...

well, yes and no. The $ from the theft should be covered, yes. But should I pay it, no, either Karpeles needs to figure out who the thief is or he should be liable, not the community. Unfortunately that may take a while.

I copy pasted the quote from my transaction details page. I also see your message of "...at least $100" on the referrals page. so yeah, maybe I bought like $1,000,000 in BTC

bitcoin is unregulated, which government deals with bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-02-28 15:15:07
When you lose $ in a high risk investment you can at least get a tax break on your losses (not quite insurance, but better than nothing). Gambling has zero protection, you either hit the jackpot or take the loss. At this stage I would say bitcoin is a high risk investment, because I believe in it and think it will be doing really well in a couple of years, but at the same time its also a gamble because there's no protections set in place to protect those who lose money
@_date: 2014-02-26 16:36:37

said "M'crosoft" in reference to the tippin' fedora meme, which usually involves a gentlemanly neckbeard acknowledging a woman as M'lady. This refers to the above comment where said he tips his hat to Microsoft.
