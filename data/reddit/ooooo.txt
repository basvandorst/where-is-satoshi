My story: Man bought $10,000 of Bitcoin since 2013, finds out its now only worth $14,000 due to stifled growth of the network. 
Why are miners letting assburgers cost them so much in lost potential earnings?

Looks like they moved with about 1400 other coins to 1E6nViR5Xv1wyNXg87SamvtLJ5TyXuksLC in 2013 and have been sitting there since. So yes, probably is still hodling.

Cool story bros, but 2MB blocks are not gonna destroy decentralisation.

Shapeshift.io set their trade limit to 0 so was rejecting exchanges from ETH. 
Waiting on their support to return my funds as I did not supply a return address.

Some people favour a small block size to ensure anyone can run a node, and despite the high fees are willing to wait until off-chain scaling is developed.
Some people favour a larger block size with higher node operation costs, to allow for lower fees and less network congestion while on-chain (and off-chain) scaling is developed/improved.
No one from any sub knows which coin is going to give the best returns in the short/long term.

Yep, when doing trades on an exchange you're basically just trading IOUs.
Transactions are only created on either blockchain when you do a withdrawal from the exchange.

You do realise that "The Bitcoin ABC developers" have followed the license terms?  
If "The Bitcoin Core developers" require line-by-line attribution, it should be specified in the license.
Greg is just trolling by trying to send them a notice of copyright infringement.
@_date: 2017-09-11 13:54:37
On what basis would Github take down the repo?
@_date: 2017-09-11 14:59:23
Which changes that were merged are subject to a different license?
@_date: 2017-09-11 23:35:06
Is there a list of these somewhere? Oh, yes in the license file for the project:
There is a single condition to using the source code, and that condition has been complied with. Its as simple as that.
@_date: 2017-09-11 14:56:51
In what way are they violating the license?
@_date: 2017-09-11 13:08:37
From his post, it appears Greg is releasing source code under a license that he doesn't understand.


































And here it is:

Thanks for the reply Greg. I wasn't aware Github operated like that.
As they're repeat offenders, if you don't like what "The Bitcoin ABC developers" are doing with your source code then will you modify your license to prevent it happening again?
@_date: 2017-09-11 13:29:35
Github are not going to just take down a repo that is adhering to the MIT license that "The Bitcoin Core developers" are using.
@_date: 2016-05-23 12:53:33
Yup it won't be broken because of my greed. It will be broken because of arrogance of crypto developers who think they understand economics. 
@_date: 2016-05-23 13:03:00
Can you please expand on this? Why will they provide this service for free?
@_date: 2016-05-23 12:49:58
I live in a good neighbourhood. So I can keep a random number on a piece of paper quite safe.
When I say "signed up" I mean invested a non-unsubstantial amount of money. Sorry for the double negative - I wouldn't call it substantial, but that's all relative.

If bitcoin gains mass adoption then centralised services will be the only option because putting a transaction on the blockchain will be too expensive. 
There are many other centralised options already available.  If the seats are too expensive on bitcoins bus then people will just take other busses. Why is this so hard for people to understand?
What's your value proposition for Bitcoin if it is the same (or more expensive) than using the local bank?
@_date: 2016-05-23 12:50:59
Yes I can continue to use Bitcoin the way it is now, but I'll have to pay higher and higher fees to get a seat on the bus. This is not conducive to mass adoption.

Ok so you are happy that a safe, secure, decentralised system is being limited so as to require paying some company to protect your money?
@_date: 2016-05-23 09:49:52
It's disingenuous to expect every bitcoin user to run a full node. The amount of misconfigured nodes that don't have ports opened properly would end up being on balance a drain on the network. 
The way bitcoin was designed, I can just keep my bitcoin safe by writing down a few words and hiding them somewhere in my house. But if you want to run a computer connected to the net 24/7 or pay someone else just to keep your coin safe, then I guess you are into some other altcoin, cos that's not what I signed up for.

This is why decentralised solutions are the only option against government oppression. Like Napster vs BitTorrent. 
@_date: 2016-07-17 12:11:17
This is great research. Would be good to see it included in the sticky.

"Suppression of dissent occurs when an individual or group which is more powerful than another tries to directly or indirectly censor, persecute or otherwise oppress the other party, rather than engage with and constructively respond to or accommodate the other party's arguments or viewpoint."
In dissenters are censored/rate-limited based on the community downvoting unpopular opinions. In dissenters are censored by all powerful moderators.
Why not end all this division between small/large-blockists and let Reddit's voting mechanic decide what type of posts and comments should be seen, and save the moderation for obvious scam/spam posts? 
If everyone can have a voice then maybe this fractured community can come together again and have open discussion without the personal attacks and bickering?
@_date: 2016-07-17 11:42:48
If it is an indisputable fact then it should be in the (or another) sticky at the top of the subreddit alerting newcomers, so they are aware there is active vote manipulation and the monetary incentive to manipulate.
If everyone is aware then they can take that into account when reading comments.
