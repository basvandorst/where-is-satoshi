I really enjoyed "not a single SP500 company has doubled in value this year". Firstly, not actually true, three had stock price growth &gt;100%. But secondly, no shit, you're telling me that Walmart hasn't checked under the sofa and found another 5000 stores it didn't know it had? Nobody would expect one of the 500 highest market cap publicly traded companies to change valuation like that.

If you travel far from the speed of light you can also move forwards in time.

No. None of this makes any sense. Virtual commodity prices are as irrational as the humans betting on them.

It's more accurate to say that everyone pays an extra 3%, regardless of whether they use cash, debit, or credit, but that credit card users get a rebate.

Gold isn't rare, the scarcity is mostly due to the fact that right after people find some gold they turn it into bars and bury it again somewhere else. In terms of how much gold we actually need for "all sorts of industrial processes and products", we have more than enough gold. Those uses do not in any way justify the current valuation.
Consider diamonds. Diamonds have use in various industrial processes but you would not use that argument to defend the price the De Beers diamond cartel are selling them at.
Gold isn't especially scarce.

Holding stocks is the purpose of stocks because stocks are ownership of a company. If I hold an Apple stock then I hold a share of Apple's business activities and a right to a share of the earnings from those activities. Owning a stock is like owning a rental property, it's an active revenue stream from economic activity.
Whereas crypto is speculation. You're buying something that you're pretty sure is worthless, but you're also pretty sure that someone else will buy it off of you for even more than you paid.
