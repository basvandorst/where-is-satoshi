I'll never get the people that call those who are upset with the state of the network shills, but I do want to let you know that we are all aware of the issue. Know one doesn't want it to remain broken, but it is and complaining more isn't going to help. Hopefully it was cathartic though. Lightning and (tbh) an increase in block size will help fix this.

IMO, mods need to just start removing post that encourage speculating on price.
Edit: There are literally 3 new posts all asking "What will bitcoin futures mean for the price".

About 6 bucks.

What you are asking to do is pretty shady, but the answer is to buy it from a person or bitcoin ATM.

If you still have the wallet file then you should be able to import it into whatever program generated it. If that was bitcoin core then you're going to need to download the whole block chain, that will take a while but you are still in the clear in terms of getting your funds.

So on the block chain? There are currently 200k unconfirmed transactions my dude.

Transaction fees to exit coinbase are set according to high-fees that are currently being bid on the blockchain. Currently there are just too many damn transactions (a lot of people think that its artificial, but I'm honestly not sure) and fees are super high. TL;DR there is no good way to exit coinbase right now without paying a stupid high fee.

If you have the private key then you can import the address into electrum via File &gt; New &gt; Next &gt; Import private keys. Paste your key there and you will have access to your funds.

GDAX is the more "advanced" trading platform that coinbase has, just go to gdax.com and sign in with your coinbase account. The interface is intimidating, but you will adjust, I promise. Once you are logged in you can can "deposit" via your coinbase account.

If anyone doesn't know what this is about: Coinbase just opened the trading market for BCH.

You can purchase directly using your bank account for a fee. If you've already moved money into coinbase via ACH (i.e. not a wire) then it will be available in 4 to 7 days. When it arrives you can move it to GDAX (for free and instantly) and buy bitcoin by placing a limit order (you specify that you want to buy at price X or lower) without any fee at all. You can then move the BTC back to coinbase for free (and instantly) so you can stare at it just like all of us.
Edit: You can, of course, also just use the USD wallet to purchase BTC on coinbase, but they will charge you a fee.

Grats to everyone that was in pre-fork. Enjoy selling off your Bcash while its worth something.

Wallets are free to generate. Coinbase generates a new one everytime.

The answer would be:
("Weight" of 1 MB of Data)\*(Size of the BlockChain in MB)\*(Number of Full nodes) / (Number of Existing Bitcoin)
The number of full nodes is pretty hard to estimate, because you can't just ping them all and the "weight" of a MB of data will ultimately just be a guess resulting in something on the order of 10^-14 grams.

If you want to hold on to the money then move it into the coinbase vault. That will make sure its reasonably difficult to get the money out if something happens. Also use the 2fa thing with your phone.

Sending from one coinbase user to another dones't use the block chain and is fee-free.

Coinbase and Gdax are the same company. Coinbase is designed to not look scary, if you login to Gdax its pretty intimidating. You'll need to give real info to both, Gdax will also want picture ID. 
Coinbase lets you: Buy and sell at market price, send and receive bitcoin.
Gdax lets you: Buy via traditional trading means (Stops, limits, margins, market price etc) and has much lower fees (and zero fees if you place a limit order). 
People who want to buy a few grand worth of coins (the fee on 5k USD on coinbase would be $73.40) deposit their USD into the coinbase wallet, pull the wallet into Gdax, then place a limit order in Gdax with the money to prevent the fees.

The 1.5% fee doesn't apply until you are over 200 USD.
@_date: 2017-11-20 16:35:01
Found on the[ coinbase fee site](


I've only ever gotten a 1.5% fee when using my bank (Ally). If your bank has an online chat (or if you are willing to call) you might want to ask them about this so you can confirm.

Its only an issue if GDAX has a smaller max than coinbase for you (it, apparently, depends on the person). I previously had a max on GDAX of 500 a week, but now its 5000. Not sure if that was an error, or if it varies or what.

Everyone that uses bitcoin benefits, those calculations are used to create the next block on the blockchain. The person(s) that find the magic number are rewarded with "minded" bitcoins. The problems that are being solved are apart of the bitcoin specification. I could get more technical, but I think that's what is important for everyone to understand. Without anyone mining transactions wouldn't get processed and we would be SOL.

Just fyi: C20 differently isn't a scam, but if you are American then you can't partake in the ICO and will need to try to buy at markup after the go-live.

1.5% is the fee on 200 USD and up. if you are paying 3% it sounds like you're probably trying to buy 100 USD, is that right? The lowest fee is 1.468% 
@_date: 2017-11-20 16:37:49
Hey guy, the 1.5% fee doesn't kick in until you are north of $200, this is clearly stated on their [website]( Its also important to point out that some banks will charge Coinbase a fee for the transaction, which gets passed along to the user.
