Combine miner votes with something like Dash Masternode voting. They call it decentralized governance by blockchain (DGBB). Then you have full nodes which are incentivized by a part of the block fee (they get paid), the masternodes cost 1000 Dash each which keeps that coin off the market and locked as well. Each masternode can cast 1 vote so the people who are actually involved in the currency get to vote on these matters. There are currently around 2600 masternodes out of a total of 5400 possible if every single coin was used in Masternodes which obviously isn't the case. 
Anyways that's one way which could be considered to make this type of voting decentralized and secure.

I thought Switzerland was getting worse or something? What's to stop people from opening an account and transferring btc internationally to send to that account? 
@_date: 2015-06-12 19:39:26
Let's get one thing out of the way, no altcoin is going to take bitcoins place. That doesn't mean they're not way more innovative in every way. 
As far as decentralization goes for voting purposes, btc mining pools would be the ones voting and two or three together comprise a majority already. How are incentivized nodes run by regular users worse than that? They get people actively involved in the process.

Incentivizing full nodes is a great idea. I'll take dash anonymity as well and add it to bitcoin. Might as well take the instant transactions. Oh and the decentralized self governing block chain. And the 2FA on the core wallet.

You're a huge pile of shit, first of all let's get that out of the way. Your idiotic comment about Colorado has no way to be proven correct or incorrect. As for the rest we're not taking edge cases where the drug is not actually the drug or a very impure form which is dangerous. Drug x exhibits effects y 99.99% of the time, up to you to take it or not. Now go back your parents basement you dimwit. 
@_date: 2015-05-29 23:12:33
Ah good let me end you then.




You don't support your rethoric with anything and my statement doesn't require a source. My statement was implying that people who don't do drugs right now aren't doing so because a law is stopping them, but because they have no interest in drugs. Additionally another poster gave a source for a part of the population actually consuming less. Since actual usage numbers are hidden because of the legal aspect of it, your argument is void anyways since no direct comparison can be made between pre-legalization and post-legalization numbers. And yet my statement about people who don't use drugs because they don't care for them anyways still stands.


You can put whatever you want in your body, You just have to move to certain areas to do it legally.
There is a reason Moonshine is illegal vs other forms of Alcohol.  
  &gt; --**As for the rest we're not taking edge cases where the drug is not actually the drug or a very impure form which is dangerous. Drug x exhibits effects y 99.99% of the time, up to you to take it or not.**


Once again you take edge cases to make your point and yet you fail to understand that I'm not giving you a statistic. We're talking about people taking a drug and that drug ACTUALLY being that drug and not your stupid example which includes x harmful substance in the drug. Drug X in pure form has Y effects, those are the effects people expect and can learn about when they read up on the drug and that's the risk they take when they choose to use that drug. And to close your argument even more, the fact that a lot of drugs sold on the streets contain impurities is a known phenomenon and also something that people can choose to take into consideration when making their own choices about what they put in their body. Legalization takes this risk factor away when production methods are enforced. 
Additionally you're getting your replies mixed up, it's probably a bit too much for your pea brain to do two things at once. The only thing you've done so far is make unprovable claims, misunderstand basic things and then accuse others of doing exactly what you're doing because you're incapable of seeing how wrong you are.

For dash/darkcoin the coins are made anonymous during passive mixing before any transaction occurs. When you pay someone it uses those anonymous funds but the transaction itself is very clear on the block chain, it's the only the link before that transaction that was severed.

@_date: 2015-04-16 13:24:22
That's not ironic at all? Those are not comparable situations. It's passive versus active models of coin join which mix coins when the transaction occurs instead of beforehand. The fact that it happens before (yes with other users who are willing to mix online) means that there are more people at any given time to mix with and timing attacks are useless.

Truly a bear market, the trend is down. At one point, most likely this year, it will reverse and start trending up. There doesn't need to be a bubble every time either.

Overall I'm very glad I moved my funds over to electrum, it's definitely way easier than I thought. Now I have two cloned and encrypted USB keys with tails+electrum offline and the 12 word seed.

Well I have the twelve word seed of course in a secure location and memorized. Does electrum make paper backups easy?

Dear Luke-JR. "Go fuck yourself." - @_date: 2015-02-25 15:58:49
When you create a new wallet it gives you 12 words to write down or remember. These 12 words are chosen out of a huge dictionary of words and in that particular exact order, they will always generate the same keys, in order. Plus 12 words in random order out of a huge pool has an insane number of possibilities so you can be sure no one else has the same words. So even if your wallet is destroyed somehow, if you know your words, you'll get back the exact same wallet you had. It's called a deterministic seed. 
The master public key part is useful when you create an offline wallet. Basically, the offline wallet doesn't know how much bitcoin each address holds, what it does know are the private keys to each address. So when you go on your online computer you can create a "watch only" wallet using a master public key. This master public key allows the online wallet to know which addresses the offline wallet controls the private keys to, while not being able to generate them itself. 
So when you want to spend from the offline wallet, you start the transaction from the online wallet which knows the balances of your addresses and go offline to finalize the transaction by having the offline wallet sign the transaction with the private key.

Tails warns you now! (in 1.3) you can create a persistent password protected and encrypted partition which stores the bitcoin wallet. I've transferred all my btc to electrum on tails and associated it with an online watch only wallet. It's amazingly easy and I can sleep easy too without a worry.
Basically if anyone steals your USB key tails asks when booting if you want to enable a persistent drive and requires the password. And even if someone has that, the wallet itself is encrypted.

1000 drk is definitely not desirable for BTC (1000 btc..) although it serves also as proof of being a valid masternode and stops people from creating them for no cost. Some amount is desirable as it removed the coins from the market and encourages buying. For example 2.1 million darkcoin are in masternodes out of approx 5 million total supply. It's definitely an interesting system even if someone simply takes the code and improves it (like your first suggestion). 
Important thing is that full nodes should be incentivized, especially as the network grows. 
Thanks a lot for your input, I was surprised by your on point analysis and creativity.

They had one main competitor (full tilt) not even half their size in 2011 and after the US seized the websites and lots of funds were missing from fulltilt, pokerstars bought them and gave everyone their money back. They have earned the trust of the entire poker world with a superior product which is constantly getting better.

If the transaction cannot be double spent against because of the masternode lock and this ensures that it gets "normally" confirmed within the blockchain afterwards, I would count that as being confirmed *enough* as a merchant to let people use what usually would be counted as 0 confirmations in reality. InstantX gives 5/6 confirmations and then requires one block confirm to "fully" confirm. 
Anyways this is a good testing phase right now, we'll have lots of people trying to break it and we'll see how it goes from there.

Well in Canada I cannot but that goes for every payment method I think because of some regulations. You can use the money with their 0% fee pre-paid mastercard though. That includes cash withdrawals I think at a certain fee.

Damn that's the first time I've ever seen that approach mentioned. It would naturally cause nodes to be evenly spread as people seek out the biggest profit. For a fair (but equally rewarded) model,check out darkcoins masternode model.

I used the first 5 addresses that were generated to split up funds (In the offline Electrum with the private key)
When I opened my watch only wallet, the 5 addresses were there, in addition to another 5 since the first 5 were used. 
When I go back to my offline wallet, how do I make these addresses appear if I use them for example? 
@_date: 2015-02-26 08:31:20
Darkcoin has exactly that. Mixing is done passively and funds are anonymized in advance and they can then be sent with instant x (a consensus locking mechanism which reverts to regular blocks if tampered with but essentially confirms the transaction within seconds). 
@_date: 2015-02-23 04:05:11
Ah thank you very much, this is what I wanted to know!
@_date: 2015-02-24 19:12:11
I have to vouch for how easy this was to set up. I put 1.3 tails onto two identical USB keys, enabled persistence for electrum (encrypted password protected part of the drive that can store files) and took the seed from one USB key and restored it to the other one.
Encrypted the wallet with another password and Transferred all my coin to it. 
Electrum gives you what's called a "master public key" which lets you create an online watch only wallet which can generate all the public keys (but not private keys) of your offline wallet. 
Basically the twelve word seed means that the same exact addresses will always be generated in that exact order. So if you want to spend the coin you just make the transaction online and transfer it to the offline tails which signs it.

This is while presuming that level is reached before the next halving or the one after that.
