In my experience, CampBX accepts super fast. It's just that Dwolla takes forever to clear payments. I have to +1 on CampBX. I used MtGox for a few weeks and it was clunky and seemed disengaged. BX feels smaller and like less of a target(?) I suppose that could just be a false sense of security :/.

O..m..g. Here, have **all** the upvotes.  You, are a genius for finding this. I totally probably could have ~~Googled~~ [favorite search engine]d this but, alas it was your destiny.

This is awesome! I've been wanting two-factor but wasn't interested in the physical keys.
*adds Google two-factor immediately*
Thanks for the info!
Edit on typos.

... Except the value is exactly* where it was prior to [Fork Monday](
*note: It's basically the exact same, for purposes of this argument.

So I did some digging and found in my email, the last time I sent any BTC via BlockChain.info. So now I can reasonably assume that's when I turned on the double encryption.
Now all I need to do is try my passwords on my singly encrypted backup!
Thanks for helping.

It doesn't work on OS X Safari either :\

I can't answer the first question, but the second answer is: Yes! The primary addresses were generated prior to double encryption.

You may be on to something! I've made tons of backups (around 50 or so, not sure why), so it's plausible that at one point I didn't have the double encryption turned on!
If that's true, I should be able to import an older backup into Bitcoin-qt and decrypt with the main password!
Thank you, I'll see if this works.

Ah, well... to Multibit!

I have 14.67 BTC. I didn't acquire them all at once, but I paid varyingly between 1 USD and 5 USD. I bought the majority at 1-2 USD, then only a couple more at 5 USD. Back then I thought I was making a terrible decision buying at 5 USD...

Thanks. I've submitted a ticket to BlockChain.info. I'll let you know if I get it fixed!

Doesn't Dwolla now stated that virtual currencies are not allowable under current ToS? i.e.: bannable offense
(I can't seem to find their terms that state this but I'm looking)
EDIT: Ok, I've found the ToS discussed in this [BitCoinTalk post](

Well, I've determined when the double encryption was enabled and now I'm trying to decrypt the backup with one one password via MultiBit.
However; the password still isn't working so I think when I turned on double encryption, I also changed my main password. If I can just find which password I used then!
Thanks for all the help so far.
