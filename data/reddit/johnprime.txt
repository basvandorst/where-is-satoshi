Have you ever heard of the johnprime fund?
@_date: 2018-01-13 00:11:26
I bought it for the novelty of it, hoping I'd get an actual bitcoin bucket or something. Ah well, doesn't matter, still chicken.
@_date: 2018-01-13 00:28:58
KFC did a promo in Canada where you can buy this with Bitcoin.

I am the step dad of two kids with an extremely rare condition called MECP2 Duplication Syndrome. They will never walk or talk, etc. If there were ever a cure it would change our lives. There is an organization called the 401 project that would be amazing to donate to:  :)

Circle is an exchange, right? So I'm assuming OP wouldn't have the private key.
sandsotime: I don't know the answer off hand, but you are at the mercy of the exchange. Basically research to see if Circle gave out BCH (bitcoin cash) after the hard fork. 
Some info here:

I really wish I had bought Coke stock before I was born.
@_date: 2015-06-02 11:50:47
This would be my worst nightmare. 
... Until I realize I don't have 25 BTC to lose. Phew!
@_date: 2014-02-01 20:06:45
Dude you are amazing! Thank you :)
@_date: 2018-05-10 13:17:00
Farewall. 
@_date: 2014-04-21 23:32:44
Sounds great! Thanks for the reply :)

It's just an access point name, try not to overthink it.
My neighbours have SSID's like "Virus.exe" and "Credit Card Thief."

Giant starburst: Zero dollars cash back! 
Awww yeaaaaah.
@_date: 2014-02-01 20:08:47
Yup. I'm dumb :(
@_date: 2014-02-01 20:08:30
Yup. Didn't even realize until later when I noticed .1 btc missing. 
The funny thing is that I was going to just use bitcoind to do it but though "nah I'll probably mess something up, I'll use something with a friendly UI." Well, somehow I still managed to mess up!

This is so ridiculous it deserves an upvote.
@_date: 2014-02-02 04:06:08
Oh no worries I used that word on my own.
@_date: 2014-04-21 22:01:19
I wanted to try out your service, got verified, wanted to cash out some bitcoin and it seemed like a very manual process, which deterred me a bit. I guess I expected to be able to withdraw money through a click of a button and not by having to send an email to CS. Has this process changed in the last month or so since I've used it, and if not, do you plan to make this process a little more user friendly?

I paid at a restaurant once and the waitress was all huffy about it "I'm going to have to find the tablet...make sure it's charged....sigh....are you sure you don't want to just use credit?" I was her first.

Can someone confirm that I understand this correctly?
Essentially a txid can change until it gets confirmed in a block?
So essentially any "noconf" service that doesn't wait for any confirmations could potentially blow up because they should be waiting for at least one confirmation to determine the final txid hash?
@_date: 2014-05-07 14:04:05
I see... Good to know.
@_date: 2015-01-15 17:52:52
I'm always relaxed, man!
@_date: 2015-01-14 18:52:01
Good luck :)
@_date: 2015-01-14 19:07:46
That is true. You'd have better luck looking up the address balances than unblurring an image. If something "unblurs" one of the 0 balance addresses, then I'd be impressed!
@_date: 2015-01-14 19:01:30
What exchange are you using? I bought some using Circle today, but it's capping me at $100 a day.

"You can't get stabbed over TCP/IP" When will this become a t-shirt? :D
@_date: 2019-08-20 13:48:25
Should have went with a move believable like that he deliberately destroyed the private keys. Mailed in his HDD to tech support, seriously wtf.
@_date: 2017-11-25 01:36:17
Seriously. You can't lose. If Bitcoin goes up you get cheap Bitcoin in a year from now. If it goes down you just never complete the transaction. 
@_date: 2018-07-30 12:25:19
I'm still frustrated about the time I tried to pay bitcoin at a pub a few years back. They were in the news for having an ATM and being able to take bitcoin as payment and I'm like oh cool. So I take my buddy there and try to pay and the girl gave me so much attitude. "You mean I have to go find the tablet so you use bitcoin? Can't you just do cash?". Payment was pretty quick and painless so I still don't understand what she was upset about.

"What a bunch of fools."


@_date: 2015-03-24 20:05:57
True enough...

For those unaware, Verisign is the domain registry for dot-com, dot-net, dot-gov, and some others. They are a huge player when it comes to the internet industry.

I wish it was Ottawa but probably not, we don't get any of the cool stuff :(
