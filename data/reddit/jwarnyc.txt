How to trade this? 
@_date: 2018-01-27 17:12:13
Well that helps! Problem solved! you can close the thread now! 
@_date: 2018-01-27 17:01:36
Again, I know what long and short positions are and I also know how to use google.  But there’s no information to the ticker.   Nor how you can trade it.   
@_date: 2018-01-27 17:00:44
I see people trading this, im logged in to Bitfinex and I don’t see it.  Would you be able to tell me how I can trade this?
@_date: 2019-07-15 05:18:30
On weekly.  It’s only one bad week. Feels like forever.  Hold your tits girls
@_date: 2017-12-03 07:37:50
Fuck! I met these fuckers in New York few years back after a quick photo shoot. I was at their office. I had no clue who they were. Up until the guy who hired me said. Yeah these fella are working on some bitcoin blah blah.  I didn’t take to heart.  Nor I cared what they were doing.   But now... fuck.  I should’ve asked some questions.  
@_date: 2017-12-03 13:10:48
That day is far off as the same day I'm not going to need anything.   But it's coming
@_date: 2017-12-03 07:50:23
This was the day the guy told me watch the social network.  So I came back home.  And honestly.  They did a good job picking up the right actors. They acted just like them.  
And I'm like wait a second these guys took all their money and bought bitcoin.  I swear someone told them to going to be big.  It's like the days when ms dos was suppose to be big.   But then I didn't know shit.  
@_date: 2017-12-03 11:10:40
Fine I'll take it.    
@_date: 2017-12-03 08:12:33
Easy answer. Imagine a country that you can't even send western union.  Imagine a country like Venezuela.  You need some sort of currency.  Bitcoin.  You can send it over and people would be like holy shit.  This thing worth something.   That's it.  
@_date: 2017-12-03 07:26:55
Just take it 5k at a time. Dr Sam won’t operate on you.  
@_date: 2017-12-02 15:58:02
Betting against the bank?! Why? You know they are big scammers.  Just ride the wave with the villains
Because in other countries don't see it this way. If you go to Russian and whip out a dollar they respect it.  And they don't be like naaaaah that piece of paper lost 99% of the value in the past 100 years.  So far the US dollar holds pretty steady against most major currencies and you don't see the effects of weakening.  Well because the other countries print too.  
@_date: 2017-12-03 08:23:05
The sexy part about bit coin let's say you have a bank account with $100 
Not only it depreciates because of inflation.  You also getting charged for having checking account. You don't get shit for holding it.  
Look at btc.  It appreciates against every currency. Like 10% daily if not more. 
If you have a seller account on eBay.  And you did something wrong PayPal will freeze your shit. So who is control over your money.  The Banks do.  just now.  I wanted to send money from venmo.  It take 3-5 days. Why? It took me a second to send my cash to someone.  Why does it take few days to get my deposit money? 
With btc it's instant.  
If you deposited more than 10k to your bank acct the IRS will be knocking on your door? Why? Why does someone need to tell what you can and cannot do.  
You'll say well.... you have to pay taxes.  I'm like why do I need to pay taxes for pieces of shit that start wars and kill innocent people.  Well with bitcoin you can actually have control over that.  It's empowering. It's liberating.  It's something new.  It's something Uncle Sam can't touch.  
That's wassup! 
@_date: 2018-08-04 06:13:00
So kinda like shift card? 
@_date: 2018-06-26 14:01:43
You mean waste ton of energy? Emit carbon? What about powering some poor countries?
You understand you burning coal and natural gas to make those bitcoins? The only time and place I would say cool story bro is if the electricity was absolutely free and clean.  Then sure build your own data center for all I care, just grow some roses around and hire someone to paint the boring building.  
@_date: 2019-08-06 01:15:12
I watched cnbc once and i all i saw was these shitty pharma commercials. they made me so anxious. I'll never watch this shit again.....

The only reason I went straight to R/bitcoin to see this gif
@_date: 2019-08-09 19:58:38
Sort of feels like bch in the past few weeks
@_date: 2018-06-25 18:02:12
Last time I checked I was buying bread with fiat 
@_date: 2019-10-26 01:41:01
Guess you didn’t bite that Tesla play
@_date: 2018-06-11 01:14:35
Can someone explain if the electricity watt per bit coin  is so demanding, how can it grow to something bigger? 
@_date: 2017-11-18 05:37:13
You’re very helpful.  Did anyone tell you that? 
@_date: 2017-11-20 06:42:54
And a big 30% drop right after 
@_date: 2017-11-18 04:09:22
Anyone toyed with btc cfd? Thoughts?
@_date: 2017-11-18 16:28:08
I thought the thread was about bitcoin.  But I could be wrong.  I’m definitely wrong...
@_date: 2018-11-26 20:20:38
Sounds like hope...
@_date: 2018-11-26 00:06:56
And how does it feel to loose all this value now? 
@_date: 2018-11-25 19:02:37
So I’m shorting everything. I’m not attached to anything.  I’m here to make money not to prove anyone their wrong.  If you don’t treat it like a business, you loose money.  All markets can take steep turns and the hardest thing is to admit you’re wrong.   
Shorting btc at this price action makes your right.  
@_date: 2018-11-26 04:12:11
I hope you guys understand buying stuff won’t keep this asset be valued as 10% of the American stock market.  
I also buy stuff... but I rather use credit cards cause they give you points, cash backs and well you can pay later.  Duaaah 
@_date: 2018-11-15 03:33:39
More predictable than any currency in The world? You mean towards the down side? 
@_date: 2018-11-25 18:20:20
Love it how you like to time shit out.  
Just like they timed the 2009 crash.  
If it’s not going to zero. It would be somewhere around that.  
Did anyone in this sub bought anything with crypto? Or used it to send money to relatives? Or fund their trading account and short the fuck out of BTC(me). 
@_date: 2018-11-25 18:28:51
Its all asset classes. And ways to make money.  It’s like the GE effect.  Price action shows negative sentiment. What makes a normal person buy into negative sentiment.  There’s no glory in loosing your money into obviously unstable market. 
@_date: 2017-09-21 08:59:10
At 2800 but then I started moving to things like bch and eth and then China news hit and then another China news hit.  And that was it.  
I got hit today with euro and now I'm back to normal.  That's not even 12 hours later and I'm good.  How long does it take to recover from every BTC dips? Waste of time more than its waste of money.  While you guys are hodling your cocks.  There's so many trades out there you can do on a daily basis which rip amazing returns.  That's why the negative attitude. 
And yeah maybe I'm just a short term trader.  And I can't see my self waiting on 20% 50% in 6 months when I'm doubling my account on a monthly basis.  
@_date: 2017-09-26 20:07:15
My take was it's as real/unreal as any other "fiat" currency.  They both made out of nothing.  
@_date: 2018-11-25 21:41:03
It never works when you say it just can’t go any further. It’s funny to hear it from a hodler... hmmmm
@_date: 2017-09-21 03:47:13
Thanks mr risk management here.... you're not for profit? You're full of shit. So you're just here to sing kumbaya? Dude who you kidding? I didn't disclose time frames but you have the crystal know it all ball.  
Good luck.  
@_date: 2017-09-08 18:41:18
Sign up to biftinex as If you're outside the us 1:3 margin.  Which is nothing honestly.  
Fxtm offer 1:1000 which is retarded.  
@_date: 2017-09-21 04:00:48
You can open foreign account with fxtm.  No social security.  Just id and proof of address of your original country.  You're gold! 
@_date: 2017-09-19 02:50:57
Can anyone explain how I can cash BTC without uncle same knowing what's up? 
@_date: 2017-09-21 03:10:17
What's w BTC loyalty? Who gives a shit? So far I lost bunch of money on a very unstable currency.  It's not trending. It's slow as fuck.  You can't get 1:1000 leverage.  You don't have apps or real platforms to trade this off your phone.  I lost the BTC spirit.  So many awesome trades in main stream currencies you can take every min. 
@_date: 2017-09-21 03:20:17
Perfect comment.  I wasn't.  I did treat it as Buy and hold.  And that too went to shit! You can buy jpy and you have way more stable chance for profit w margin.   Aren't we all for profit here? Or we just want to root for some digital viral currency? 
@_date: 2018-11-26 07:02:15
Gaines are colorless.  Don’t judge others because you attached yourself to the other side.  You can’t make money if you think only in one direction.  My gains shouldn’t concern anyone. It’s strictly business. Nothing personal buddy.   The less you care about the story the more chance you have to survive this hostile environment. And if you don’t like it.  Just go plant a tree or volunteer for a good cause.  
@_date: 2017-09-15 16:49:12
That's why I'm like you know what I'm just gonna use BTC for real use like sending money from account to account with minimal fees. This SURPRISE! Down/up 20% is getting little annoying 
@_date: 2017-09-09 03:30:55
I got wiped on margin :/
@_date: 2017-09-08 13:19:23
Thanks for writing this I've been saying that the dollar is as real as BTC. I would argue that the dollar is even less real just because they can print more.   I going to share your writing on a comments I had previous fought and argued that the dollar is the same digital currency, just because we have cash laying around doesn't mean it's as real. 
Now the main question how to get BTC or any other coin anonymously.  I don't need anyone to know what I have or don't have.  I heard of monero. Any takes? 
@_date: 2017-09-21 14:13:15
And that's exactly what I'm doing! That's why I'm expressing disdain for something that I obviously  can't manage.  Also what freedom?  Everything is tracked regardless on larger scale.  If you can, help me figure out how I can cash out bitcoin without he government knowing about it and in that case Yes there's a clear advantage.  And maybe that's the he freedom you taking about.  Please don't mix making money with some higher cause.  It's total bs.  
@_date: 2018-02-08 16:53:05
There’s exchanges you trade cfd and convert your profits into btc and save in the wallet and you can send it right away.  But that didn’t answer your question.   
You do sort of in a slow typical way.  You realize your profits and you send your money to your bank account.  Some brokerage companies offer debit cards.  Which is instant payment.  
@_date: 2018-02-08 15:13:51
You clearly didn’t invest into amazon or visa. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 16:49:12

@_date: 2017-09-21 08:14:56
I obviously did. And the only thing I would need it is to cash out. Which is still pretty difficult avoiding authorities.  
@_date: 2017-10-01 08:57:26
Duaaaaaaaaaah omg I didn't see that coming ��
@_date: 2018-07-16 02:48:40
Yeah but btc going to 60k is way better headline.  Love it how people pick and choose what headlines to listen to 
@_date: 2018-07-15 18:50:29
Exactly my point.  If it takes too long to explain why you think it’s going back up.  Its simply wont.  
@_date: 2018-07-16 14:21:50
Yuuuuuge traffic I see
@_date: 2018-07-15 18:45:02
But it doesn’t 
@_date: 2017-09-21 08:49:10
Fuck the kitchen! You can play chefs all you guys want. Ill just eat ready made food.  Also you'll never gonna get rich w BTC its a lost trade since everyone and their pets know about it.  
@_date: 2018-07-23 18:02:52
Can you use shift card for Venmo? 
@_date: 2018-07-15 18:44:46
What’s the reason for it to go back up? I just really want to see your logic.  
@_date: 2018-07-19 23:07:27
Just trying to hedge braaaah
@_date: 2018-07-16 02:46:51
You mean not the same reason it dropped to 6k from 20k.  Let me get this straight.  So the same rules don’t apply from going from 20k to 2k or 0
Did anyone one on this sub actually used btc to buy anything? I can say I did, I sent money to Europe with btc.  But most people never used it for anything besides trading. And if you ask me it’s as speculative as any other penny stock.  
The difference between then and now is. There were some major headlines and news coverage. 
Do you see any of it now?
@_date: 2019-05-17 16:42:55
According to this sub.  It’s a flash crash? Go figure
@_date: 2018-12-23 23:43:13
If bitcoin community cared more about adoption rather than trading solutions.  And people weren’t as driven for quick 20% overnight profits.  We might have had a really great tool to whatever we wanted to believe what bitcoin should’ve been.  
@_date: 2019-05-17 17:17:54
What about the pump and dumps we can experience In crypto in day to day basis? Also I don’t see anyone talking about thieves stealing stocks from an exchange.  Something we’re very familiar with crypto.   Soooooo it has its own major hurdles.  Let’s not get fluffy with crypto
@_date: 2018-12-15 05:01:16
For transfers it awesome.  As store of value is Fucking garbage.
