If you need oxygen, even thin air is pretty damn awesome.

Why would a sat need a dedicated symbol?

Darnit. So you are the one driving up the price!

What's wrong with waiting to get rich? There's plenty more other stuff to do.

It's not yet Friday in some parts of the world. Plus, did he explicitly say this Friday?
@_date: 2019-02-12 18:34:13
Accurate enough. I'll take it.

The hopium is strong in this one!

My imagination is not strong enough for this one.

Maybe also think about your Google authenticator

I think there will always be people who are not able to blame themselves when crypto funds go missing. E.g. when they send it to a wrong address. Hence I believe there will always be middle men service providers taking a fee to bear that risk, even in a decentralized world.

Because every crypto kid wants to be able to store their 100 usd worth of random shitcoin with this device otherwise they tweet about how shitty the device is.

@_date: 2019-01-03 12:12:58
Thanks for sharing this perspective.

Note to self: keep funds ready for that one day &lt;2k

I recall this as if it were yesterday. To think that people here in this topic were not yet alive during that event makes me feel very old... :)

The Fortune is strong in this one.
@_date: 2019-05-20 18:58:37
They should not be totally out of luck though. Just enough out-of-luckage upon those poor souls to drive the price past the exosphere :)

I love your approach and look on things, just not so much on the 'meager' part. Just have seen too many good people pass away way before their time. So remember to live a little every once in a while and I wish you all the best in your endeavors. We'll do a toast in 10yrs on the one mln BTC :)
@_date: 2019-05-20 19:02:13
I see what you did there...... Smart!
