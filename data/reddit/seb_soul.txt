Genuinely curious but how/why would ZIRP affect value investment? I am not very well versed in this or economics/financial management. 
Are you looking at it from a consumer point of view, in that low interest encourages spending and thus revenues and profits for corporations would be higher?
Or from a business perspective where I assume ZIRP means lower weighted average cost of capital and obviously a lower WACC on a discounted cash flow means higher future cashflows.
Or are we talking something a whole more holistic? In which case I really don't know macroeconomics so I'd really be interested to hear.

How options work is like this:
It is a contract to say you have the right (but not the obligation) to buy or sell the underlying asset (in this case Bitcoin) at a fixed price before a fixed time period.
So this person or group purchased the right to buy 275 bitcoins at $50,000 at any point before December of next year. For that, they paid a non refundable fee of $1m.
So here is one potential scenario of what they could be thinking... Bitcoin is either going to grow massively, or crash like a mother:
1. If we buy 275 bitcoins, and it crashes to zero we might lose $4.4m (275 coins x $16000)
2. If it moons to $75,000 we gain 275*(75000-16000) = $16.2m
On the other hand:
1. If bitcoin crashes, all we've lost is our premium of $1m
2. If it moons to $75,000 our profit would be 275*(75,000-50,000) = $6.9m - $1m premium = $5.9m profit.
Scenario 1 = 16.2/4.4 = 3.68 risk to reward ratio
Scenario 2 = 5.9/1 = 5.9 risk to reward ratio
Another scenario could just be that they are hedging / minimizing the potential loss of a short position.

That makes it your dads fault.
How is his ignorance Coinbases fault?
What next? Is it the supermarkets fault that your dad bought 2% milk instead of 1%?

I didn't say as easily. But you claimed it wouldn't be easy for banks to manipulate, and I just proved they could very easily.
Just proving why "but marketcap" means fuck all. The only thing that matters in pumping up/down prices is the amount of liquidity on the exchange. The more liquidity, the harder to manipulate prices. And Bitcoins liquidity is fuck all compared to a big banks ability to manipulate if they so wished.

Buy into fear, sell into greed. Best way for smart money to accumulate or distribute at their ideal price point.

Tbf insider trading is only a crime in a regulated space and regulation is pretty much against the general consensus of the bitcoin/crypto world so I hate to say it because he is right. It isn't a crime.

If you are betting on the price of crypto on a spread betting site.
If you are buying the underlying asset, or a derivative of that asset (like futures), then you are trading. 
That is regardless of the amount your are spending. Except in the case of gambling, where if your gambling becomes your "trade" i.e its what you do to earn a living, I believe that becomes subject to income tax.

What would you say are the most important aspects to learn?
Like how can I learn about resistance levels and trade volume beyond the basics of knowing what they are? How to learn to a more intermediate or advanced level?
