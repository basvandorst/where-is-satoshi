I agree, actors with a lot of resources such as states, which do mass data collection beyond the Blockchain, have capabilities that the average user doesn't expect. If you don't want to get caught the safest way is to not do anything illegal.

It's been 10 years since the discussion about bitcoin's value started. I thought it was worthless and didn't buy at $20 because its "not real money". We can philosophise about bitcoin's value and watch as it currently trades for $10,000 all the way to several hundreds of thousands in the coming years.

If it's not Bitcoin, it'll be a more centralized, controlled, censored version of it. None of which will appeal to a large part of the population. So bitcoin is here to stay. And it'll take a lot to unroot it as the network effect and brand recognition is strong and growing by the day.

Is it possible to move BTC from Coinbase to Pro and withdrawal it from there for the lower fees?
@_date: 2019-07-01 22:54:34
My initial experience with them was also very negative. They kept replying to my support requests with unrelated answers from their online FAQs. It was condescending and I felt ignored as if not one gave a damn. Yesterday was the first time I felt I might get a resolution.
The lesson from this is that custodial bitcoin services will be as rubbish as the incumbent banks because they are run by humans with profit as the main goal. We must remind ourselves that bitcoin was invented to make us economically sovereign and make custodial accounts obsolete. However, while we're growing the user base, we need to be able to convert bitcoin into other currencies. But I see this as a temporary phase until the day that Bitcoin is THE currency. Long live the dream.

It's as if they're all pegged to Bitcoin. Hmm...
@_date: 2019-07-20 19:31:19
Now it's super easy compared to 6-8 years ago. You'd have to go into some dodgy IRC room and trust the miner, who had BTC, wouldn't run away with your money.
If you're in the US CashApp is probably easier than Coinbase.
But you have to bear in mind that the incumbents aren't going to make the onramp to Bitcoin, a tech that might make them obsolete, frictionless.
@_date: 2019-07-02 17:39:38
Lightning labs have created one of several lightning implementations. And one of of many companies who have built lighting wallets. Lighting labs don't own the lighting concept or protocol or wallet. So when you say you the lightning app, it's so generic that it shows that you don't know what you're talking about. Always try to be as specific and accurate as possible, especially when complaining about something, if you want to do it with credibility.
@_date: 2019-07-04 11:47:55

@_date: 2019-07-23 07:45:01

@_date: 2019-07-07 09:20:10
The reward is related to the risk of how much bitcoin was bought when. Early adopters had the biggest risk and the biggest reward as the network is growing. But back 5 years ago noone knew for sure if Bitcoin would still be around now of if it'd take traction. It's the same today relative to the future, however I'd say less risky considering the size and growth pattern of Bitcoin. But one should never take the past as a definition of the future. So invest cautiously. The golden rule of "don't put in anything you can't afford to lose still applies today".

Lighting is still in its infancy. Andreas Antonopolous has high hopes that it'll handle millions of transactions with very cheap fees. He also says there are other solutions and improvements being worked on. 
These things take time to get right and refine. Just think of the early days of the internet. In the 1990's everyone would have told you that there's no way the Internet could transmit video at 4K. But solutions were found. 
The advantage that bitcoin has is that the problem of scaling doesn't require laying down new hardware and physical infrastructure. It's just a software problem, which I hope/suspect will be fixed much quicker than the Internet bandwidth problem was. But will happen cautiously as there are very high stakes while upgrading a network worth billions. 
So be patient, read as much as you can on it, and try not to let it stress you out as we have some of the most skilled engineers working on it.

Fees and speed of transactions are being worked by the lightning network. If you have used it, you'll understand why that's no longer an issue to sweat over. And with this not being an issue, the currency with the biggest network effect momentum is the most relevant currency. I don't see any altcoin taking over bitcoin's network effect and brand recognition anytime soon. If ever.

The wallet I use, that generates the amountless invoices, is  - it's a more fully featured version of tippin, and supports many social networks.
The reason I know that Lightning supports amountless invoices is because I had the exact same problem withdrawing some sats from another website. I contacted the developer and he said that this was the issue and fixed it in a few minutes. Hence why I asked here because it sounded like a quick fix.
I'm glad that we demonstrated the capability of the Lighting network. Is it possible to have the bot updated?

Network effect is so underestimated. Most alts showed up due to Bitcoin being too successful too quickly and the protocol struggling with the demand. The speed and cost of transactions is being handled by the Lightning network so that kills 80% of alt coins main purpose. The other major thing alts tried to fill in the gap is privacy. That's already being tackled in other Bitcoin projects such as coinjoin and many more privacy features are on their way. Smart contracts on the Bitcoin blockchain or side chains are also here via Taproot for example. This leaves 99.9% of alcoins as being redundant as they were never as decentralized as Bitcoin nor will ever have Bitcoin's network effect. The Bitcoin brand is known globally, alt coins can't compete with that. Altcoins were created by two people. Impatient devs who couldn't wait for Bitcoin's dev pace and get rich opportunists who saw a chance to get rich by exploiting the noobs. This is why I am bullish for Bitcoin and a Bitcoin maximalist and feel sorry for those that fell for the altcoin craze a couple of years ago in the hope that it would surpass Bitcoin. Sorry guys, your alts are pointless.

@_date: 2019-07-15 07:37:24
So if exchanges trade more BTC than they have this inflates BTC and makes it seem it's more readily available and therefore cheaper. Hadn't thought of that before. It probably also applies to custodial wallets such as Coinbase and CashApp. It'd be good to know as these services hold huge amounts of Bitcoin.

In 2012 I installed this weird app, I read about in a forum that would give you free money. I noticed that it was using all my CPU power and uninstalled it immediately. "There's no such thing as free money", I thought. 2 years later people were still talking about this internet money thing and before installing the software again, I read this PDF that some Japanese guy had written. My mind was blown! I started mining straight away. I tried to buy BTC but it was only available OTC in some IRC rooms. Risky to give $30 for 1 btc to someone I don't know, I thought. What the heck. Later I built a mining rig which lasted about 3 months before mining became too difficult to be profitable with GPUs. Since then I've been buying on and off and every year more confident in the technology, the economics and future of Bitcoin.

That'll never happen. Sadly to get into Bitcoin people have to understand why the fiat system is broken and unfair. Most people don't give a shit past cat videos. It's more likely that something centralized and introduced by a large corporation takes traction into the Billions. Yes, my faith in the average Joe is this low. I hope I'm proven wrong though.
@_date: 2019-07-07 09:43:44
I have in the past sent transactions successful at 1s/b. I had to wait a few blocks but it went through. That's why it's insane that some wallets and exchanges don't let you choose the fee. Most of them will way overcharge for a fast transaction and then blame it on the network traffic.

Bitcoin network was clogged up due to demand and at the same time Ethereum ICOs euphoria made everyone believe it would cause a "flippening" of Ethereum taking over Bitcoin. The FOMO made people exchange Bitcoin for Ethereum and failed to see most of the hype was a scam. When the hype died and very little emerged of ICOs people realised they had been fooled to sell their most valuable asset and started buying BTC again.

With wallets it depends how much you're investing. Custodial wallets like Coinbase or CashApp are a good starting point if you don't mind buying bitcoin without anonymity. Then phone and desktop wallets are the second best, depending on how much you're storing. I would use software wallets like your back pocket cash wallet. If you feel uncomfortable walking around with a certain amount of cash then buy a hardware wallet like Ledger. These provide the best security because they are not connected to the internet so can't be hacked without access to the device.

Exactly no other network has the amount of talent working on Bitcoin and layer 2 solutions. It's a matter of time until the capacity and other problems are resolved just as the HTTP protocol's capacity restrictions for delivering HD video was resolved.

Look up network effect.
No other crypto has the exposure, the longevity, the security and the free advertising that Bitcoin has. This creates imense network effect momentum. Even if other cryptos may have some advantages, they can never replace bitcoin in the above.

I disagree. It's all relative to lifestyle and materialist ambition. If you want to drive lambos, yes 1million is nothing. If you want to live the simple life 1million is more than enough for a middle aged person to retire on. Buy land, a small house, an electric car, solar energy, have an edible garden and enjoy the elements, the bees and the birds. You may need a bit more if you're doing it as a couple. But it's totally doable. This is my plan.
Oh and if you retire to a country with a much lower cost of living than Europe or the US, then you'll be king.

Whoever risked the most will have the biggest reward. Initial investors bought bitcoin when most laughed and didn't believe in its value. In the end they will be rewarded for participating early and helping bootstrapping the interest in the network.

It's up to users to manage their own privacy. There would be nothing stopping Facebook users using a wallet with more private features. Also, the bitcoin protocol keeps evolving and privacy will improve for sure. 
There's also Lightning Network, which is already more private than Blockchain transactions.
@_date: 2019-10-29 13:41:24
The incentive had to be there for early adoption. It makes sense to reward those who believed inthe technology first and risked the most.
You've described a dictatorship, regardless of ideology, will look like what you described. Real socialism is a form of democracy. If there are taxes it's because the people voted for it to pay for public services which the majority of people agree are worth having for the common good. If you have a single leader or a cabal calling the shots, that's not socialism.

"High" fees is still a FUD topic? The Lightning network put that to rest a long time ago. Also timing is everything as is the ability to edit your own fees. Learn about the tech and you won't pay high fees.

This and also the fact that the people who bought early had the highest risk therefore have the biggest reward.
@_date: 2019-08-12 15:27:47
People who risked the most will have the highest reward as they were the ones to believe and laid down the groundwork for newbies, when everyone else mocked them.

Money is just the tip of the iceberg where the naive populus has been taken advantage of. Remeber the society we have today was molded by war winners and who wins wars if not the most powerful, ruthless, deceptive of human beings. I'm not talking about the poor sod in the front-line. I'm talking about those in decision making positions. Humans have been at their mercy for milenia. Only now we're starting to see how manipulated our naivity has been taken advantage of, just as an adult manipulates a child but the child is starting to become capable of critical thinking.

Why would there be a flurry of opening/closing transactions on the Bitcoin Blockchain if you can keep channels open and transact on lighting indefinitely?
Also, the Blockchain will become more efficient and eventually scale up to allow more transactions. You are assuming that the Bitcoin blockchain will never scale and that no work is being considered to scale it, which is wrong.

"First of all, we want to be able to afford it, and we can, easily." Affordability is a relative concept. If people are struggling to pay the bills and food how can they afford private healthcare? For as cheap as it may seem to you, for them it'd be unreacheable.
"Right now, massive amounts of tax money are spent on wars, bail-outs, corruption, inefficient buraucracy and secret projects hidden deep inside the conglomerate of three-letter agencies."
Agreed. Lot's of waste.
"...a better idea would be to give ownership of the company to the people working there."

With lightning you use unique invoices for each transaction so the account addresses are not revealed. There are also already ways of improving privacy using a mixer. Haven't used it yet but exists precisely of your concern. Also, you don't use the same address. You should create new receiving addresses for each transactions so that privacy is improved. But I understand your concern, that people who value privacy may be put at risk by people who don't. Hey welcome to planet Earth. Sadly we're all being held back by the lowest common denominator. But that should stop us trying to educate and evolving.

The blockchain is not private but there are ways of conducting more private transactions if the user follows some precautions. Lightning is one of them, creating new addresses for transacations, coin joins, etc.
A lot of what you describe is not a problem with bitcoin but the infrastructre around it, such as exchanges.
I agree that Bitcoin has much to evolve, but where have Bitcoin's problems been solved without compromising on decentralization, scarcity and open source?

Erm, the left vs right paradigm does not apply to the size of government. Historically there have been both sides of the political spectrum using the government institution to increase power and oppress populations via all available means - monetary oppression just being one of the tools.
It's not the government that's the problem, any large institution with centralized decision making and unchecked power becomes corrupt and will use all tools at their disposal to keep and increase their power. This is particularly notable today with multinationals, some of which have more capital and power than many countries combined.

Why do people become obsessive about a particular topic? Perhaps because they see the transformative potential for the planet? Perhaps because that particular topic had a deep impact in the way they perceive the world and they feel strongly that the world would be a better place if everyone knew about it? Perhaps that is what Bitcoiners and Vegans have in common.
As for the stereotype that vegans have the need to tell you about veganism. Even if that is what some vegans do, how would you know that it's an accurate representation of the whole vegan community if you don't know how many silent vegans you came across?

Is it really all they ever talk about? Or are you using an anecdotal observation to pain all vegans the same? Would you know how many vegans you came across who didn't tell you they were vegan? Of course not. 
If someone is passionate a particular topic, like most people are in this forum about Bitcoin, does it make them part of a cult? Or is it simply something they are excited about and want to share with the world?
Be careful creating stereotypes out of prejudice.

Absolutely. After having read the Satoshi white paper in 2013 and doing more research in the days after, I knew Bitcoin's potential was enormous. I bought and mined for a while not as a get rich quick motivation but as a, "wow this technology can change the world and I want to be a part of it".
Understanding the tech made me feel confident in my investment and resolute in holding during volatile periods. If you don't understand what you invest in, if you're not in it for the conviction, you'll be swayed out of your position. You'll later kick yourself for doing so and learn the hard way.
Moral of the story, always understand what you're investing in and never go full in or full out.

I mean it in terms of adoption. If you've been around for a while, you probably know of Linux, how it was going to be the future of operating systems. Surely everyone would choose to switch from M$ Windows to the very capable free alternative. It didn't happen because 1) people don't understand that they're being scammed by the current monopoly and 2) it takes effort to learn and switch. I fear Bitcoin may be stuck in this unfulfilled potential forever.

Problems I see with ETH.
1. Devs pre-mined and kept an absurd amount.
2. The currency inflation is currently quite high.
3. Vitalik holds too much power.
4. They have in the past reverted transactions to retrieve coins from a hack. Existence of a potential central point of corruption and manipulation.
5. Many tokens can and have been created on the Ethereum blockchain which require no ETH to interact with, so the ETH currency is kinda useless.
6. Dev features oversold and underdelivered - where's the promised POS?

@_date: 2019-09-08 09:39:41
1. Because alts overpromise, underdeliver and underperform.
2. They are created by a few people for greed not for charitable reasons. They are get rich quick schemes for the owners, not users.
3. They are centrally controlled meaning that they can be coerced and corrupted even in the unlikely event of starting with noble goals.
4. Many are pre-mined and don't allow mining -- see any alt on coinmarketcap with an asterisk beside its name. It's amazing how many noobs don't realise this con.
5. Also there's nothing that alts offer that Bitcoin doesn't offer either on the base blockchain or isn't being worked on second layers.
6. Alts are a scam to separate you from your sats, the most valuable, the most censorship resistant, the most secure, the original, the daddy of all cryptos --  Bitcoin.
