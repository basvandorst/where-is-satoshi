Their community, their rules. You agreed to that when you signed off on their EULA and TOS. They're not beholden to authorize auctions of something just because it's legal.

One funny thing is how much the tech scene in Los Angeles revolve around supporting the porn industry. Every other tech guy down there has a connection, did work, or are working in the industry. 
From listening to them I think the perspective is this. 
On one hand bitcoins solve a major headache:
Chargebacks. Major players deal with chargeback often. Middle-aged father of three and a dog gets caught with an unexplainable charge on the bill then calls in to renege on it. Or after billing doesn't care for the site and tries to get that 50 dollar charge wiped clean. Payment processors side with their customers, in this case the guy that spends $100k a year on debt. 
With bitcoins the payment is transferred and non refundable. They get to have more power by controlling a major bottleneck in operations, that of payment. 
On the hand now operators can't play the subscription game. 
When they do setup shop and get big with millions in transactions with some shady payment processor AND manage to hold on to a valid credit card number then they love to play the game and milk a sucker dry. 
That slip and slide charge tactics generates a lot of revenue. And lucrative trumps the pain. 
Until solving the pain is as or more lucrative the status quo is here to stay. 
Though to be fair, whichever way the wind blows the porn industry, they blow harder.

Tons of people pay. When they value quality and convenience for whatever specific niche they're into.
