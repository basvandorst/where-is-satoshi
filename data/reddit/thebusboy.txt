I actually agree that this is an important thing that should be brought up more. It's easy for anyone to get blinded by their good moves, but during the $7800 push I almost sold at 7550 with the thought that it would fall back to low 7000s by the end of the night, and if I had done that I would have lost a lot on the short term. It's hard to admit when we have short-sighted decisions on the internet especially when no one has to know, but I'd love if more people came out and acknowledged the bad decisions they almost made/did make in order to add a bit more skepticism to the whole environment. It's healthy to acknowledge we made good and bad gut calls, but even more important is understanding that gut calls are really slightly above gambling decision making for most of us. Without tons of data to at least back decisions, it might as well all be schoolyard talk for everyone claiming they understand price movements.

As a college student with just a little spendable income, I've found that this system is what works best for me. Papa Johns probably doesn't love it, and I do miss some of my weekend pizzas, but at large my only regret is that I don't have more money to invest.

Would you be willing to share any of the especially interesting readings/videos you've found? As someone extremely interested in the space I'm specifically interested in potential uses of blockchain technology, so any out-of-the-ordinary theoretical implementations would be great to read about.

Please let me know what response they give you

Color: Charcoal grey. I mentioned it in a thread yesterday for the guy who is attempting to sell his bitcoin rollercoaster model, but some of your shirt store vendors should try to get in touch with him. Best of luck everyone.

This isn't meant to be an attack on you, but I just don't see how a vigilante justice system is a practical punishment system in a society. That's coercion of an individual who believes that they are acting on behalf of society, but that seems to allow massive mental gymnastics on behalf of the individual to justify their actions. I would be genuinely interested in reading about how vigilante justice could theoretically police a society with any semblance of protection against the majority

The $50 price point (if you can manage to profit on it that low) appears to be the sweet spot to me. I'd imagine most people getting this will understand that there is a decent bit of technology that goes into creation, but siting at $49.99 makes it just affordable enough that people who have done well on bitcoin might say, "You know what, it's not that expensive and it's a symbol for how well I've done. Why not?" On another note I would be advertising these things extremely hard during periods of rapid price increases (the $1000 day being an incredible example). This product might have a ton of hype purchases, so get eyes on it everywhere when it's showing off a vertical climb. Maybe try to get in to talks with the guy who runs the bitcoin payment shirt website here because I've seen him/her/them doing a decent job of advertising around forums, and even if you have to give them some % cut of sales I'd guess their site also sees a ton of traffic during major price events. Finally, great job turning it into an actual product; I've been thinking about trying to make a personal one for myself, and I'm glad to see it's an achievable goal.
