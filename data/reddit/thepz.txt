How could they test this short of *spending* Bitcoin?? It's not their responsibility to ensure people are going to sign up for legit websites
They're doing the right thing taking them down after the fact, but you can't expect them to pre screen for these kinds of apps and catch 100% of them

As does every software marketplace ever. You make it sound like Apple is scheming to wrong devs

You guys act like this sub is bitcoin central when in reality it accounts for a very very small  percentage of people that actually have money in it on a global scale
@_date: 2014-12-18 01:40:55
What the h*ck man! Excuse my language
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:01:45
This is seriously some grade-a entertainment. Every post on this sub addresses it as if this is bitcoin central of the universe. Wake up, it's not. This sub in reality is a very small percentage of actual bitcoin owners. Enough with the bitcoin psas.

Because most people cant let it consume the entire conversation, and it suddenly turns into an aggressive sales pitch

California recently enacted a lot of restrictions on device sales which inadvertently effects the whole US market

In (near) real-time? I don't think we're quite there yet.

What a stupid question.
'Do you assume the government agency responsible for the mass tracking of digital communications was involved in the tracking of the most prolific illicit website to this date?'
No. Fucking. Shit. 
The methods they use are extremely hands off

Pretty sure it's valid for the remainder of the month

The client probably only is that big. The current blockchain is different than the client

I am not down for more madness. I couldn't buy or sell bitcoins during the last one because of it I was just able to sit back and watch, wasn't fun.

If your not paying for electricity than theres no overhead just startup cost. Impossible to just "break even" unless you stop when you break even
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:21:02
theres gonna be an initial upswing, so many people waiting to buy coins! ITs gonna spike and maybe burst again
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:53:56
Waiting on a return period that long with bitcoins is more of a gamble, your either gonna strike it HUGE or its gonna be nothin. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:59:58
Don't be silly, set an investment amount in USD, and stick to that investment. Don't base it off the value of the BTC in USD. In theory it won't matter you still have the same chance of getting a profitable return.

Its new means its the best time to invest, and we won't know where any investment will go in 3-5 years. Youre situation seems like no reason not to invest. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:54:30
No one can help you with that information you provided, its like saying my car wont start what do I do. 
Bitcoin is not a scam, you are suffering from user error. What part did you lose the money? Depositing? Withdrawl? There are several steps within each too.  
@_date: 2013-04-11 00:02:16
FPGA not sure if you can get one for 500 tho
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:35:04
Agreed. I coulda saw this a mile away. Its like traffic on the highway, chain reaction of people just slowing down each other for nonsense. DONT SLOW DOWN TO LOOK AT THE ACCIDENT DUMBASSES JUST CONTINUE YOUR DAY AS USUAL, DO THE SAME WITH THIS

If BFL is in fact going to be released, its probably too late to get one at a reasonable time before its too late. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:39:15
What did it sound like on the site? Like a gong lol??
@_date: 2013-04-11 03:54:28
From what I have gathered once all the terahashes from the ASICs get unleashed GPU mining for bitcoins will be useless. BUT many people will still GPU other cryptocurrencies after this happens, such as litecoins.

Regardless its not illegal. Businesses can treat customers however they want

They would only help bring the market to its true final equilibrium state even faster. We are still only in the beginning thats why it is so easy for the price to be manipulated.

"... as if thats legal."

Watching any show targeted for children under 9 years old is weird, let alone 9 year old and under girls.

Almost every piece of advice is dont be prepared to spend than you are prepared to lose. 
Anyone investing in anything should no that there is no such thing as guaranteed money, that is just common sense, which a lot of people on the internet lack

I had 1.6 bitcoins that I bought earlier in the week in 2 seperate purchases, 1.1 @ 165 per btc and .5 at 185 per btc. 
I got rid of them at 183 per btc, came out *just* over even

LETS GO RIDE THE MAVERICK BRAH ALL THE WAY!!!

If it was through their official support channel through them YES, you are totally right. 
Over a 3rd party forum NO.
Also in the EULA/Terms and Conditions I am sure it says they have the right to do it in whatever time they see fit if their servers are experiencing issues. They would be stupid not to for reasons like this.
