Ha yes, i do realize that the time value is obviously quite longer for LQMT, but my point being that BTC is following a very similar pattern in basically a condensed time period. 
I personally am a bit of a risk taker, so i'm hoping all the best for BTC... just throwing out a fair warning..

First &amp; foremost I am definitely not discouraging BTC at all! In Fact, I think it’s a great decentralized crypto-currency. However, I am just throwing out there a simple &amp; fair warning for in terms of “investing” in BTC. 
In General, people like routines and patterns in life. They tend to do things and do them again and again in the same way. Same goes for stocks and trading in the market. People get the initial hype, buy in, and then some get scared and sell off when they see a dip in the price. After the initial hype dies down a bit we will begin to see the stock begin to equalize at the true market value.
In this chart comparison, we are comparing two very volatile and young “securities”. BTC on the top, LQMT on the bottom. Both had a tremendous state of hype, which then followed by several crashes and several recoveries. The interesting part is that you can see a very consistent pattern between the two charts.
This is just a simple comparison chart between two young and hyped up securities. I and nor does anybody have any idea of what the future outcome of BTC will be from a value point of view. Only time will tell.
**TL DR: Similar chart patterns between BTC &amp; LQMT.  Don’t invest $$ you can’t afford to lose. Higher Risk = Higher Payout.**
