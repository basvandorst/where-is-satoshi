Yep. And if you check google trends, you will see that Russia feels the same way in terms of search interest.

bingo, these guys are late to a potential party for once and they will be consistently trying to find ways to find time to catch up over the next few weeks. This community should be prepared for more of this language from this ilk. He is basically writing to say, "hey guys, I own Bitcoin too but just relax okay. I need time to buy more before it starts to take off anymore."

Agreed. An admitted speculator of the currency with the Forbes microphone, buying himself time to free up more capital while the pickins are good.

They better outlaw cash too with that kind of logic.

Interesting note. This was a really well assembled article. And such timing of release! :)

It's funny that you guys don't even acknowledge that this is also a huge characteristic of a large pump-and-dump in the works.

That's what I can't decide. If it has a few years or a few months. I could also be really wrong about it too.

Dammit! Sorry to go off script everybody! "to the moon!" amiright?!?

Absolutely, this place is full of starry-eyed evangelicals. When was the last well - upvoted post you saw explaining why bitcoin could fail? It's just not the mentality of this community because so many have a lot at stake. I understand that but this makes it different from many speculative markets I've been around and contributes to the volatility, I believe.

Reddit is full of Bitcoin Gordon Gekkos now didn't you hear?

What is the discount if you don't mind me asking?

Haha, you must not have lost a dime or you'd be singing a different song. I think it is more constructive and conducive to long-term success to analyze what went wrong and offer alternatives and discussions on prevention from it happening again.
I don't think Bitcoin is a bubble, nor did I lose any money here, but I will tell you that your comment and its attitude are often found in the anatomy of the creation of speculative bubbles. Positive news skyrockets to the forefront of the discussion and any negative is shrugged off and left unexamined. Be a proponent of the technology and not an evangelist. The former is better for Bitcoin's future because it acknowledges weaknesses and addresses them before they compound into a larger threat to the success of the idea as a whole.
