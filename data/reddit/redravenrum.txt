That's actually the fascist view of bitcoin. "Bitcoin *should* be used this way." The anarchist/libertarian view would be that it's your choice, you can do what you want with it, and the market provides what users demand.
The point of bitcoin isn't to force everybody to use it the same way. That's the system that we're in now, trying to get out of. The point is to let people opt out if they want to; to let them use it as they see fit for themselves.

Isn't this just the inverse of an ad hominem? Instead of blaming someone for their past work, he's being unduly credited. By that I mean, obviously he deserves credit for the things he's done in the past, but the current mess in bitcoin isn't about that technology, and on top it's not really even about technology at all, it's mostly political infighting. His technical contributions aren't any kind of qualification for open source/political leadership. In fact I'd argue that they're actually bad, since they provide a bias for thinking his opinion is worth more than others'.

Why does it seem coincidental? OP didn't give us any kind of timeline about when he issued the report vs when he got banned. Also, people get banned from Coinbase all the time for silly small things like buying weed on Agora - why is it *so* unlikely that OP did this from his account? Third and most important, *why* would they ban him as a result of a bug report? That's a valuable user to keep around, it wouldn't make any sense.

He did get a reward, did you read the post?
@_date: 2015-12-17 00:16:07
No it isn't. Of the top 10 BTC-USD exchanges I'm pretty sure bitfinex has been the only one offering it for a while. It is definitely *a* liquidity source for those who provide it, maybe even primary for bitfinex. But it's a false statement that most have it.

I guess we'll have to agree to disagree, as my points regarding this are above


This isn't really how most companies work.

Circle really can't be beat in terms of security so I would go with them.

This will be considered evil until Circle follows suit, at which point it will be recognized as savvy business practice and of course they'd all make it that way.

If every 10 minutes, 20 people join the line, then the queue grows infinitely and wait times get increasingly worse, so waiting is not a solution.
@_date: 2016-03-05 23:51:35
This is true. However, in our vehemence in trying to force Coinbase into behaving in a way we want them to, we also squeeze out smaller "mom and pop" players (regular users) who don't have the same resources, making bitcoin worse for everyone.
@_date: 2016-03-06 10:54:08
This kind of communication is the kind of thing that validates some of the points in his blog post.

Really? At least one co-founder of Coinbase seems to be pretty enthusiastic about Lightning: 
@_date: 2016-03-06 10:50:13
I mean Coinbase is already paying tx fees at thousands of tx per day so I think that's empirically false.
Basically you are ensuring that Coinbase will not get competition because the scaling costs of competing with them become prohibitive.
@_date: 2016-03-06 23:39:10
There are several services which accept bitcoin payments and spin nodes up on AWS as a service. There's nothing really shady about it. Who would pay for all that on their own?
@_date: 2016-03-05 23:49:19
SW sounds awesome and I'd love to see it developed. But I am skeptical of the timeline and the hesitancy to hard fork it. For these reasons, to me, it does not seem like something that should be considered a scaling solution.
@_date: 2016-03-05 21:08:15
While I agree with you, since it's an open protocol there's no way of enforcing it. The expectation should be that people will always act selfishly. Which means we can't expect them to change, we have to offer solutions that take that into consideration.
@_date: 2016-03-07 06:13:47
I agree with the cause but not the interpretation. There's clearly a vote going on - to me, these new nodes spinning up are the result of people placing votes in that election. Meaning regular users spinning up nodes using spin-up services provided to them. How would it look different if it were actually organic in your view?
@_date: 2016-03-05 23:52:45
Then we'd squeeze out a lot of normal users for no reason.
@_date: 2016-03-06 10:53:12
And that's why we should increase the block size.
@_date: 2016-03-06 20:46:20
I think he's pointing out the maxed out blocks with that screenshot, not the mempool.
When I originally read this tweet it sounded nice and like all was well, but the more I think about it the more I realize that "average" of anything, especially over 24 hours, is not a good metric.
If there's peak traffic at a certain time of the day where blocks are maxed and txs get delayed by hours, it won't seem like anything once it's been averaged out. But it still happened.
So I think reporting averages basically glosses over any issues that could be starting to come up. A better metric would be % of blocks filled over time - it would be interesting to see how that is going up/down, maybe even over the past year or so.
@_date: 2016-03-07 00:55:50
The purpose is not propaganda. The purpose is to support Classic. I have spun up nodes. I'm not a propagandist. I'm an actual bitcoin user who's been into it for years. I'm not a talking head. And while my personal experience is anecdotal, I find it very difficult to believe there aren't many more like me, and that this isn't where the new nodes are coming from.
If they were all fake I'd expect the count to be much more erratic, with many more coming on or going offline at once. The fact that the growth has been steady and consistent over the past month is, to me, an indication of its genuineness.
@_date: 2016-03-07 00:34:16
I understand your argument, but I don't think it's true. You could argue that so many nodes on AWS is bad centralization, but to me it seems the more important factor is ownership, not really geolocation or datacenter location. It doesn't matter that these nodes are located closely in those terms, as much as it matters that any given person running a node can't shut down the other ones on AWS on a whim.
Don't get me wrong, nodes hosted on local hardware might be even better, but the likely case here seems to me that large amounts of independent people are spinning up resources. This is the way the distribution model of much of the internet works today; that bitcoin nodes are following a similar pattern is completely unsurprising.
@_date: 2016-03-05 20:36:45
I don't think you can realistically expect people you don't know with unknown incentives to try to do any optimizations for the sake of the network.
People are selfish. If we want things to change, the incentives have to be economic. Meaning spam should be cost prohibitive.
If we get to the point where the difference between sending 1x or 2x its regular transactions makes a difference, that's probably in the category of a few dollars of fees per tx.
You could get this from a fee market, but at this point, bitcoin breaks for many use cases for regular people. We haven't actually punished big players, who have lots of resources, like we intended - we've punished the small guys.
Which is why we should move in the opposite direction and increase the cap, allowing both, and reducing spam by making the difference to fill a block a much higher price than it is currently.
@_date: 2016-03-06 20:03:20
It might just be a place where people are allowed to think for themselves.

@_date: 2016-03-06 20:20:59
I mean why even reply if that's what you're going to say?
Do you not see what he's talking about?
@_date: 2016-03-06 10:52:18
Exactly, I completely agree with you. While the engineers all argue about the specifications of the bus, regular users are starting to just hail other buses. Spot on.
@_date: 2016-03-09 08:32:47
I don't think your last paragraph is necessary. If time will prove things, let it. No need to associate me with the irrational and the blind before that happens. I could say the same things to you and they'd evolve into a flame war and nothing would have been added to the discussion. You may be right. But when you pat somebody on the head and say "poor you, not understanding things," it shows that you do not respect who you're talking to. People generally don't open their minds to learning things from those they don't respect.
From your stats, I think clearly some fraction of people who run any kind of node are going to remain somewhat up-to-date with their versions. The decision to upgrade your node doesn't seem to me to be equivalent to deciding whether or not to accept a fork in the longer term. When you're looking for a new job, you generally don't turn down raises. When you're looking for a new car, you don't stop filling the gas tank. Obviously not every Core user is seriously considering a switch, but the fraction is unknown.
It's also unknown what percentage of Core nodes are cyclical. The pattern is clear, but does that mean 100% of Core nodes follow that pattern? 50%? 20%? The dips and hills could be much more extreme, and for this reason I think it's reasonable to assume that the majority of Core nodes are not cyclical. If you accept that most Core nodes are not cyclical, it is easy to accept that many Core nodes as well also run in the cloud. And if this is true, they're also easy to spin up. And if this is true, one might expect to see Core nodes replaced as quickly as they're migrating.
It's a possibility. I don't think I'm trying particularly hard to "miss the obvious." Some nodes migrate, other nodes replace. Something like this doesn't require a conspiracy, just people who believe in both sides. As one side grows, so does its opposition, in lockstep.
I'm not denying that the Classic nodes are probably mostly spinups. I'm sure most are. But what I am saying that a spinup node doesn't represent some kind of fraud. I believe they represent real people taking an action they believe can influence developer / miner trajectories.
I think if they were fake the chart would be much more erratic. It wouldn't be slow, steady growth. If the nodes were fake and only responding with the proper agent, not doing real networking and block validation, I would have expected a DOS to have no real impact, yet we can clearly see a significant dip in node count when that occurred.
And if you accept that they're real nodes, then they have real costs associated with them. And especially over this length of time, that cost will have added up to a lot of money. I find it much more likely that this cost is spread among individuals who believe in the fork, committing to nodes organically, than a small set of conspirators [meticulously] planning and paying for all of it from their own pockets.
@_date: 2016-03-06 00:40:18
Yeah maybe. But I mean there's other buses out there that are working perfectly fine. Litecoin has 4x the space. Ethereum has 12 second block time and seems like dynamic sizing. And maybe these will have issues in the future that are as-yet unseen, but they're not driving into trees and seem to take reasonable approaches to solutions. This flat-no drama to the increase just seems irrational in comparison. I can see the other buses. They're real, they're working, and that makes me skeptical of the very strong desire to not go that way with bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-03-05 23:50:25
Yeah, metaphor stretched too far, I don't get it.
@_date: 2016-03-05 21:07:37
I agree. It would be great if those things were developed!
I also think the bus should be made longer in the meantime. A doubling in block size would be a good thing.
@_date: 2016-03-07 06:16:36
How is it inflating if they are real nodes that I'm paying for?
Don't these same arguments apply to Core nodes?
@_date: 2016-01-01 20:49:18
Funny how it seems to happen to companies who voice support for an increase in blocksize / bip 101.
@_date: 2016-03-05 20:32:42
The reason a "fee market" is bad is because if the bus only has 10 seats, but 20 people want a ride, not everyone can ride, no matter how high they're willing to bid.
So sure, people can compete on fees. But we should also increase the size of the bus.
@_date: 2016-01-01 21:04:38
So how do we start the conversation about what implementation to move to?
@_date: 2016-01-02 02:36:57
XT for example is already being run by some.
@_date: 2016-03-07 07:56:59
Yeah I would say that I agree with most of that. I don't think anyone is trying to be dishonest though. For people who do not have hashing power and realize the futility in trying to acquire it, this is a way to express an opinion. Kind of like marching in the streets in protest. It has little practical value, but it has influence, and that influence makes it worth it if that's what you believe in.
This isn't an important point, but I think also that one or two nodes per data center would still be low. Because that would mean only one or two users are taking advantage of that entire data center to host a bitcoin node. And if that's just some dude in Kansas whose credit card expires, then the node shuts off and we've temporarily lost all the potential of that whole data center. For the simple purpose of redundancy, more sounds like a good idea.
I also believe that outside of just the Core/Classic issue, this is likely to be a development that re-occurs in future client debates. AWS is very popular now, and this is just sort of how a lot of people deploy things these days. I remember about a year ago, even before the whole debate got any big, there was a service that let you spin up regular Core nodes on AWS by paying to a bitcoin address. That wasn't for any kind of propaganda - regular users saw it as a cool, helpful thing. The current ones are just replicas of that same idea for Classic. And I think if bitcoin had been released today, we might see a much larger fraction of Core nodes operating this way.
@_date: 2016-03-07 08:19:11
So I think that the data you provided is open to interpretation and there isn't a real way to know what is the truth. Your explanation does sound reasonable, but there are other possibilities as well.
For example, Core does seem to be on a general downtrend over the last 1.5 years or so. How do we know that more Core nodes have not been getting spun up in response to Classic nodes getting spun up? If Classic had not been announced, what would the Core line look like today? It's very possible that it may have been a continued downtrend, and ironically maybe the debate with Classic has spun up nodes on its own side to counter the influence.
In other words how do we know that many of the Classic nodes are not old Core nodes, switched over? How do we know that the downtrend that would have been there was not filled by Core favorers, spinning up their own clones? What if there is much redundant mirroring on both sides? This does not seem like an outlandish possibility to me.
If "organic" Classic growth were defined by a corresponding decline in Core nodes, you could perpetually convince people that Classic growth was fake by simply spinning up enough Core nodes to maintain its original balance, and that seems just as easy of a rigging.
It also seems like a possibility to me that many of the Core nodes do not represent active opinions, but are potentially unattended nodes chugging along without supervision. Passive nodes that are set and forgotten about don't seem to me to be representative of informed voting.
If each month nodes were made to automatically shut off unless their operators had to manually select which version to run the next month, what would the chart look like? I have a suspicion that it would include fewer Core nodes.
I don't know much about miner commitments. I've heard that both sides have been getting commitments, and signatures have been getting placed on papers, and actions have not corresponded to those agreed upon obligations, on both sides. I'm sure there are piles of evidence to be dug up from twitter. I think that's a whole other debate though.
@_date: 2015-03-17 04:30:48
Are they, though? Consider: if you were a scammer, wouldn't it be in your interest to complain about your canceled orders so Coinbase's policies become more lax?

I think you mean figuratively.
@_date: 2015-11-24 23:43:21
No it doesn't.
Also wasn't there a poll a long time ago that showed that more users had lost bitcoin do to their own mistakes at key management than to third party services?
Operating your own keys is crucial to monetary freedom, but that doesn't mean it's right for everyone in all, or even most contexts.

Any exchange dealing in fiat must necessarily have a traditional banking relationship. Because of risk and regulation, banks don't give relationships to decentralized networks, only other centralized companies.
@_date: 2015-03-17 04:29:15
It's funny because Circle's cancellation/complaint rate is actually higher, they just have fewer users so people don't hear about it as much.
@_date: 2015-03-17 04:33:59
1) You can buy at Coinbase, Circle, Celery or Trucoin
2) Any of those sites just let you store it there, but if you want to store it on your computer (honestly, probably more dangerous than a *reputable* cloud wallet) look at the desktop section on bitcoin.org: 
3) Probably not. Since bitcoin is a protocol, it is also necessarily global, which means one (or even multiple colluding) government entities could never truly shut it down. Hamper it for a while, sure, but not cancel it outright.
@_date: 2015-11-25 06:20:55
Okay, you basically said "I disagree with you" wrapped up in a bunch of fluff and no content.
