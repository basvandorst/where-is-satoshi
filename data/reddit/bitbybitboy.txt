I have to say, the more time I spend with anyone or anything related to cryptocurrency that does NOT reflect the core fundamental basic beliefs of preventing centralized power with one person or a group of people ( and NO, miners do not have centralized power within the Bitcoin community as per Andreas Antonopoulos ) The more I find myself discarding the value they   are trying to sell me on. Ripple and others who are trying to CO-OPT a movement that was created by Bitcoin with old school, out dated antiquated centralized control systems are now all in the same category of holding zero value to me and my principles. Those of us that have all walked down similar paths to find Bitcoin are for the most part, of the same mindset, and those that are just trying to take the short cut to fame, fortune and power are missing the whole fundamental point of this movement. This is expected to happen thou, with more and more exposure to what is valuable about Bitcoin , you will unfortunately get the bad actors that come along like from an old scene out of a tired old B rated movie they are just trying to rejuvenate their failed mission in life to be famous. The one thing that these people are missing, as long as you hold onto it, you will not fail, and nothing can derail you from your ability to succeed,  is your creativity.......... the smallest amount of creativity gives one more power to change the world over the one that appears to have the most power. And this is why Bitcoin will change the world, NOT centralized Altcoins.
