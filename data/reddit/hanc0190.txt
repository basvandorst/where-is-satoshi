I'm really worried about a hard fork on the horizon. This doesn't look good.
@_date: 2017-03-15 12:53:15
There is obviously that, on top of it, emergent consensus seems like miners have a huge say in deciding the block size, and nodes have to gradually bend over and accept.
@_date: 2017-03-28 13:02:26
I read the whole post and he had some valid points. And I hope you can see it too. Particularly the part explaining the damage a contentious hard fork can do, should BU force one with 75%+ hashing power.
I have said it before on this forum that the difficulty adjustment for the Segwit chain (minority chain at that point) will be a hurdle to overcome, and you have to take into account that Chinese miners attacking you by mining empty blocks.
I like Segwit, not sure when/whether it will be activated.
Edit: I'm interested in your opinion on what your solution to the adjustment of difficulty is, should the hard fork happens and Core chain becomes minority chain.
@_date: 2017-03-17 14:33:36
Which is why a "consensus" hardfork is very important. It's important to strike a deal with Roger Ver and Chinese miners. Perphaps a deal that involves:
1. Segwit activation
2. A very well defined trigger mechanism for future block size increase, so we don't get stuck in political quagmire anymore.
3. Roadmap to Lightning Network and other off-chain applications.
I'm on the side of Segwit, but I understand a contentious hardfork would probably destroy Bitcoin. We need a compromise to bring as many people on board.

On-chain scaling can never achieve VISA level of transaction rate. A blend of larger block size + 2nd layer solutions is the only chance. Even that is limited.
Bitcoin can process 5 transactions per second. During a black friday sale, there are 30,000 transactions per second. I am not sure if any of the current cryptos can achieve that level of scaling, without sacrificing decentralization. I hope anyone can prove me wrong though.

So everyone needs to process about 256 MB of data stream into their hardrive, every 10 min?
Not sure if anyone has that big of storage, for an amateur I meant.
Edit: also, bigger blocks travels through network slower, allowing room for double-spend attack.
@_date: 2017-03-22 16:37:02
So what's their solution for scaling? Bigger blocks?
Edit: "These were put in place to stop people from ballooning the size of the block chain before the network and community was ready for it."
So I guess their solution is bigger blocks. I'm not opposed to bigger blocks but blocks too large could be problematic because: 1. fewer people can run nodes handling bigger blocks. 2. bigger blocks take longer to propagate on the network, making BTC more vulnerable.

I have run it for two days and the only issue so far is that Pi only has 1Gb of memory, and Bitcoin Core Wallet requires 2 G, so the wallet crashes sometimes. But you can use swapfile command to increase your memory.
As for guide, I used [this](
But there are couple of things you have to pay attention to.
First, change




Second, make sure you update your blockchain on your PC, as it is much faster than updating it on Raspberry Pi.
Third, I don't recommend "Return Swap File Back to Default", as the memory of Pi is only 1G, and you need 2 G to run the GUI version of the wallet properly.

I own both BTC and ETH. Neither is perfect, but I like the way ETH is mined, which penalizes ASICs. ASICs is just too expensive for an amateur like me to afford.
The way BTC is programmed will give rise to mining cartel. We are already seeing this impact with Chinese miners' rogue-ish behaviors.

@_date: 2017-03-15 20:47:47
I would agree. I can provide two nodes right now. And I think I can sustain 2 nodes with 2 to 4 mb block increase. But BU's emergent consensus gives too much power to miners, nodes can block sizes too large that they don't want to accept, but nodes will be dragged alone it seems.
@_date: 2017-03-21 15:01:39
I think this should be taken seriously, Roger Ver has about 300,000 bitcoins. It will send BTC price plunging if he sells all his BTC for BTU.
Also, I'm a little worried about the difficult on the Core chain, if more than half of the miners switch to BU. Without a HF to lower the difficulty, Core chain will become... difficult to use. But if you HF, there could be 3 types of bitcoins, aka, a total shitshow.
@_date: 2017-03-16 19:32:28

Miners think they are in control of the Bitcoin. But ultimately the users and the market will decide what value Bitcoins have on the market.
Giving miners cartel-like power would, in my opinion, discourage new comers. In the end BU might give bitcoins "digital gold" status. Which is fine, but I worry that it won't be used by people in their daily lives to buy stuff, which, I think, was what Satoshi wanted.

I was a small blocker until recently, until I read Mike Hearn and Satoshi's email exchange. 
That was way back in the day, when Mike Hearn just started getting to know Bitcoin, and did not understand much of the underlying scaling roadmap at that time.
Many of Satoshi's visions were thought to be wrong, but turned out to be right. I think on-chain scaling is the way to go, and running a node doesn't provide security I need. A simple hardware wallet + SPV wallet (as Satoshi envisioned) is good enough.
@_date: 2017-08-25 14:03:21
If my predictions are right, on-chain capacity increase of SegWit will not be enough because:
1. Transaction demand is still too high for SegWit blocks to handle (a good thing because BTC is getting more popular. And a bad thing because everyone has to pay a higher fee, potentially giving up territory to Alt-coins.)
2.  Not everyone will use SegWit transactions (either because the user doesn't know how to, or doesn't want to), so we don't get the full benefit of capacity increase.
The 2x for SPV wallet is actually incredibly simple, you don't even need to upgrade your wallet, since SPV wallets only check for block headers and ignore block size. It will have a long term effect on nodes though, so that's the trade-off.
@_date: 2017-08-29 17:05:50
If 51% of the miners are honest, then running your own node doesn't provide much of the benefit, I would worry more about virus and stuff. Realistically, using a hardware wallet provides more security benefit.
If 51% or more of the miners are not honest and are attacking the network, then your node won't be able to protect you.
@_date: 2017-08-26 02:59:18
LN only exchanges IOUs of Bitcoin, not actual Bitcoins. You need to open a channel and close a channel to use LN. And those can take up on-chain space, you need on-chain capacity.

Coinbase signed the NYA, they will list segwit2x as Bitcoin.

Yeah, who defines what real Bitcoin is though. You think 1x should be Bitcoin, I think 2x should be Bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-08-01 21:20:03
I think it will be likely, if the blocks are full for a long time. The LN whitepaper mentions this:


Last month I believe there was a period where blocks were full for a long time. Heavy congestion I believe. I think that was bad for LN. In the long run, we need a dynamic block solution, IMO.
@_date: 2017-08-10 14:52:55
I might be in the minority here but I support 2x hardfork.  The 8mb segwit2x blocks are fears overblown in my opinion. Segwit2x blocks will only occasionally get to that big, in most cases, segwit2x blocks will have an upper limit of around 4mb.
Going beyond 4mb means a miner will have to take out transactions for room for witness data. Doing so is not maximizing profit.
Also there is the issue of how quickly segwit transactions can be adopted. I know Electrum cannot do segwit transactions on day 1 of activation. Do you know any wallet that can do segwit transaction quickly? Litecoin had segwit for ages and Trezor is the only one that can conduct segwit transactions.
@_date: 2017-08-29 16:08:16
On the other hand, if BTC has 8mb blocks and blocks are full with everyday transacion, BTC could be worth $20,000 a piece.
@_date: 2017-08-22 20:28:34
If a spam attack and render your network too expensive to use, maybe you should come up with a solution for it?
@_date: 2017-08-21 16:01:30
If 8mb happens once in a while I am very sure BTC network can handle it.
BCH network can handle a 8mb block, so can BTC. Unless you are running Raspberry Pi 3 node then... you should upgrade your hardware.
@_date: 2017-08-21 13:49:01
I also want 2x. Been redditor for years.
@_date: 2017-08-10 18:36:21
Users on this forum have also said BCH would not have any value after the chain-split. It still has about 300 dollars per token. So to say segwit2x chain does not have any value is.. I don't think will be the case. As for the 2x hardfork, I think odds are in 2x's favor, because:
It's not just the miners who are for the agreement, it's the exchanges too. Coinbase is for the agreement, so are major Chinese exchanges. Barry Silbert negotiated the agreement, so Poloniex is on board. SegWit2x will become BTC, if these exchanges say so.
Now you can say, well people can dump 2x coins for 1x coins. Well that's technically possible, but will be difficulty and risky because:
1. Moving 1x coins off exchanges takes long time. Currently, at most 10% of the hashpower don't support NYA. So block time will be 100 min. Forget about difficulty adjustment, that takes 150 days.
2.  As we have seen in the BCH fork, exchanges are in fear of 51% attack on BCH, and require 20 confs. This makes getting 1x coins to the exchanges exceedingly difficult. Not sure how many users would prefer this.
3.  There is no guarrantee that exchanges will list 1x coins in the first place, so a lot of users will withdraw from exchanges before the fork. This will probably make traffic on 1x coin even more congested.
4. SPV wallets will follow the longest chain, regardless of block size, as they only check headers. So that's a sizable community following segwit2x already.
What I think will happen:
As it currently stands, Core is losing, I know Core has amazing talents, but you need hashpower to generate blocks given the current difficulty. Core can, propose a hardfork to reduce difficulty, like BCH did. But, doing so would make yourself an alt-coin, not Bitcoin. BCH was briefly recognized on Electrum as a fork before its difficulty dropped and violated SPV's rule and was no longer recognized by Electrum.

Schnorr signature combines multiple signature into one, so that would help with countering spam attack, but it does nothing to everyday transaction where I pay from address A to address B + C (where C is a change address).
Some estimated that Schnorr only increases on-chain capacity by 40%. So at the very best, SegWit + Schnorr is like a 3mb-4mb hardfork.
Lightning will help, but keep in mind that LN is only exchanging IOUs of Bitcoin. To actually acquire Bitcoin, you need to settle on-chain. Preferably the more often the better. Unless you buy coffee regularly, opening / closing a channel just for one small transaction is not worth it. They are, BTW, 2 transactions, worth of 10 U.S. dollars these days.
@_date: 2017-08-09 15:48:04
According to [bitcoinfees.21.co]( &lt;10s/Byte transactions are taking 4-98 blocks to be confirmed. Each block is on average 10 min, so that's 40 min to 980 mins to get the first confirmation. Not good.

Can you really argue that a node wallet provides more security benefits than Electrum + Hardware wallet?
What are the benefits of running a node against Electrum, really?
@_date: 2017-08-25 11:39:43
There is more nuance than that, yes? 
While it's possible that a segwit block can reach around 4mb, it actually does not carry that many transactions in that block. Because it's filled with witness data.
The real block size limit will be around 2mb, because going beyond that will cause miners to lose transaction fee, generally. 
**Edit:** please note that in both 2mb and 4mb scenario, block weight can max out at 4,000,000 byte, which is the actual limit of a segwit block. 
Having a set limit with the potential to provide drastically different transaction capacity is one of the objections raised against SegWit.
@_date: 2017-08-12 15:12:03
You know SPV follows the longest chain, regardless of block size, yes?

Notice that you didn't answer anything to bitroll's question. Bitcoin Core's 1mb chain will have, most likely, a tiny portion of the majority hashpower. Like it or not, hashpower is centralized in those companies, a casual user like you and me didn't purchase mining machines. Hashpower = control over the network.
Hashpower will become a huge problem for Core because the blocktime on 1mb chain will be in the 100 min, and difficulty adjustment will be 100+ days.
@_date: 2017-08-22 18:41:51
LN is good, but you will need to open a channel, and close a channel. Either count as 1 SegWit transaction.

@_date: 2017-08-24 12:48:34
SegWit is a small on-chain capacity increase (a block can carry more transactions), which introduces a new way of calculating how many transactions fit into a block. Long story short, blocks now are restricted to a 4,000,000 byte (4mb) **block weight limit**. These new segwit blocks might have a **block size** that's larger than 1mb.
To see what each block's block weight/block size, [use this page on BTC.com](
If 2x hardfork is deployed, this block weight limit will be increased to 8,000,000 byte (8mb).

It is, and so are Bitcoin Classic and Unlimited. But those are compatible with the current blocksize, and are compatible with 2x size too. Are they not valid nodes? Shouldn't their voices be heard?


From his email exchange with Mike Hearn, and from Satoshi's forum presence, I believe that he would have coded that in, had he  been able to. Most likely he was dead, but I wish that was not the case.
I don't think segwit softfork should be rolled back. I'm not opposed to segwit, I just think that on-chain scaling should be done in a swiftly way that transaction fees don't rise up so much that Altcoins get an edge.
I know you probably want to mention LN as a scaling solution. But remember that LN needs on-chain settling, periodically. Also, LN could probably give exchanges a lot of power given that they are the ones with enough coins to be hubs. And that is centralization, since most LN users would initiate 1, or at most, 2 channels to one of these hubs.

I think you mean you run a Bitcoin Core node, and 2x is invalid to your Core node. Which is fine, there are other types of nodes that would accept 2x chain. And here is the fun fact, it doesn't take that much effort to set up nodes. Someone set up like 5000 ABC nodes when BCH forked off. Only nodes with significant economic values (exchanges and mixing services) matter.
1mb limit was never the permanent solution. It was only acting as the temperay spam filter. Satoshi himself said the 1mb can be lifted with a miner mining a larger than 1mb block, and see if the rest of miners accept it.
There are only three fundmental rules that define Bitcoin as what it is, if you read the white paper.
1. 10 min block time (difficulty changes to make sure that)
2. Block reward halves every few years
3. Proof of work system (SHA256)
@_date: 2017-08-21 15:30:29
Clearing up your FUD.
segwit2x has the potential to reach 8mb, but average segwit2x block size **limit** will be around 4mb.
Going beyond 4mb means miners will have to kick out transactions to make room for witness data. Doing so would reduce profit, unless the attacker is willing to pay an astronomical amount of fees.
Also I'm pretty sure BTC network can survive 8mb, if it happens once in a while. BCH just had an 8mb block few days ago. The network didn't crash.
@_date: 2017-08-09 19:22:35
Let's have a 1x vs. 2x hardfork with no replay-protection on either side, and let the market decide?
The longest chain is Bitcoin, since SPV wallets can't reject blocks larger than 1mb (nodes can, but SPV won't).
@_date: 2017-08-26 05:39:32
The chain with the most proof of work is Bitcoin in my opinion.

You are right. But this is also important for Bitcoin because: F2Pool boss has said in the past that he wanted Litecoin to activate segwit and see how it goes. [His words were]( "We’ll do it on Litecoin first and then make an evaluation if it is feasible on bitcoin."
If it goes well he will signal segwit for Bitcoin. It will segwit significantly, if f2pool signals.

None of exchanges on board. You can't split away with just 20% of the hashrate.

@_date: 2017-05-15 00:53:34

The blocks are full. Need larger blocks
@_date: 2017-07-21 13:43:26
I read the whitepaper, it said that you have to trust 51% of the "honest nodes" (hashpower) to be honest.
So to say it's completely trustless is not true.
@_date: 2017-07-05 13:08:19
I think BIP91 will force an BIP91 signaling of 100% of blocks to be BIP141 by Jul 31. 
This will render BIP148 harmless

UASF will not work if it does not have grass-root support. And the grass-root does not seem to care.
@_date: 2017-07-28 19:12:24
The biggest criticism I think for SegWit is that because it's a softfork, people who are slow to upgrade will slow down the capacity increase. So it looks like SegWit will be activated at [block height 481825](
How many wallets can provide SegWit transaction capabilities starting at block height 481825? How many exchanges?

It's time to take Peter Todd's FUD about BIP91 lock-in not equal to segwit activation off the stickied.
I have always said that miners will stick to the agreement. They have everything to lose if price drops.
The amount of FUD and conspiracy in this sub is frankly, embarrassing.    
@_date: 2017-07-05 17:08:24
I now just hope that I can use segwit transaction right after segwit activation. I know a lot of wallets are segwit ready but I don't know if there are guides to using a segwit transaction.
@_date: 2017-07-18 19:54:01
Problem is even more serious on LTC as one pool (F2Pool) controls 50% of the hash.
@_date: 2017-05-21 18:13:31
Ah, no there is a difference. 
Pow change means you are throwing all miners who invested millions under the bus. Your future chain, whichever pow you decide to use, will attract much less capital to secure it, as people know that pow can be changed with ease.
I'm not sure if that's a good way to go about it. Blocksize change is not a big deal, as long as it is not changed aggressively.
Edit: you might not like it but crypto currencies are always a balance between couple of desired properties, two of them are low transaction cost and security. You CANNOT hop on one proof of work to another and expect your chain to be secure. Chains with proof of work easy to change will attract less interest to secure it. You open yourself to attacks.
@_date: 2017-07-09 13:44:47
That is a confusing explanation
@_date: 2017-07-14 01:01:56

@_date: 2017-07-19 02:49:22
If miners are using relay network to connect to each other, then they can hear each other when BIP91 is activated. 
What GMax described is a case where BIP91 enforcing miners can't hear each other and non-enforcing miners are building the longest chain.
GMax's theory is unlikely because:
1. Antpool is enforcing, and can out-hash all non-enforcing miners by itself.
2. Miners use FIBRE to connect to each other.  They can build on each other's blocks and orphan non-signaling blocks just fine.
@_date: 2017-07-14 02:12:53
Miners activate BIP91, forcing all blocks to be signaling BIP141. BIP148 won't do anything if all blocks are signaling BIP141. 
@_date: 2017-07-10 19:08:41
So, does this mean if segwit is activated, I can start segwit transactions on these wallets, right away?
I see all three brands of hardware wallets (Keepkey, Trezor, Ledger) are ready. And Electrum is ready. That's nice.
Edit: I'm a little dubious on this "segwit-ready" status. Not trusting this unless devs of the wallet come out with a statement saying segwit transactions features are ready and pending activation.
@_date: 2017-07-25 19:08:42
This is just hilarious.
@_date: 2017-07-01 11:36:31
Well if the real demand after segwit activates would be 1.7mb. Shouldn't the average block size remains 1.7mb, after they raise transitional block size to 2mb. I mean changing the limit does not change the demand.

Sucks that I have to trust some other node to validate transactions for me. Oh well, let's hope one day I can set up my own Electrum server.

So far this works (but I understand it does not provide as much security as TailsOS). Electrum can be bundled with Tor browser to sign transactions through Tor hidden services. I have not tried it with TailsOS though.
@_date: 2017-07-20 12:25:17
I think you meant BIP91 locks in. Then later BIP91 activates, orphaning any blocks that do not signal for BIP141. After a difficulty adjustment period, segwit (BIP141) locks in. Segwit then activates around Aug 15th.

I prefer SegWit but let's face it, the fixes you mentioned (malleability upgrades, linear scaling of sighash operations, signing of input values, versioning...) can be done without SegWit too.
Bitcoin ABC client fixed the quadric sighash problem already. Zhuoer Jiang, who is in charge of BTC.top, has said they plan to fix txn malleability through a hardfork too.

Bill Silbert led the negotiation, so that's Poloniex on board with the segwit2x roadmap. Coinbase is also on board, Bitpay is also on board. Bitcoin txns pool is obviously larger than those three, but to say that no one wants to use segwit2x coins is just not true. 
Most people do not know the technical details of the fork, they will use whichever coin their exchange gives them.
@_date: 2017-07-05 16:31:27
Yeah, I appreciate your help and up-voted but that is not I had in mind. I was just wondering if there is a wallet that can interface with a hardware wallet and can still broadcast on Tor.

If you step out of this subreddit you will find that all major economic players are backing the agreement. More than 80% of the hash is on board with the agreement.

I am a fan of LN but please don't forget that you need to open and close channels on-chain.
This is not talked about often on this reddit, but Poon mentioned in his LN whitepaper (yes I read it) that when people try to close channels but can't (blocks are full), they might lose money.
Poon suggested a dynamic block size in his whitepaper. Yes I know, the author of LN whitepaper preferred a dynamic block size.

Miners have started signaling BIP91, a protocol that will do exactly what BIP148 does: orphan blocks that do not signal for BIP141(segwit). 
Because supposedly there will be a 80% hash rate majority adopting BIP91, they can effectively force all miners to signal for BIP141, segwit.
@_date: 2017-06-25 16:13:37
No longer. My mistake.
@_date: 2017-07-21 13:53:49
No, 100% of blocks are signaling "NYA", which is the agreement that outlined segwit-2x roadmap.
