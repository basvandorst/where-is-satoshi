Technically shouldn't he be from Crete?  In which case I'd just suggest a short ship ride to Cyprus to visit a Neo &amp; Bee to find someone to explain this to him.

bitwise XOR is bitwise addition modulo 2.  I'm just saying it isn't wrong to call it addition.

That is _technically correct_ in binary.

Man, I'm happy with this sideways movement.  I just learnt that I'm not a daytrader, when I just lost ~$2000 over the past couple of weeks after making more than ~$1200 by luckily catching a few of the big movements.  Now, I'm just buying and hodling, and need some time to build up my cold storage using paychecks in the coming months.

Actually I thought she was quite well informed, I mean she even mentioned that it isn't quite clear what the reasons behind the whole Mt Gox collapse were.  I don't know what more you expected her to say.

Banks can easily afford to be free because they are actually borrowing _your_ money.  The return from market investments on the money you have at the bank is their fee.  
Banks provide you a lower interest than the market and in return they lower the risk.  In principle this is a great system, the problem is when banks are mismanaged and gamble away the money and then beg for bailouts.

Gee, thanks for the tip :)

Yeah, I short-sold some on the margin at $550, hoping to buy back in at the bottom ~500-520, now it's looking like that may not happen.
I'm just treating any minor losses I make here as course fees for learning about speculation :)

Actually my OCD is to make all buys in multiples of 0.01 btc.  What really upsets me is if you buy $100 of btc and get like 0.21052632 btc

That's pretty much how coinstar works.

Just watched this interview and bought a set of rechargeable batteries off his website instead of going to a physical store tomorrow.  Didn't even have to launch my wallet, just sent the money straight from my account on the exchange.

2 cents = $0.02 ≠ 0.02 cents
