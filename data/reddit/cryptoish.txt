or, you know, he didn't believe in bitcoin.  
  
not everything is a conspiracy people.

he was probably FUDing so the lizard people could grow their hands. NWO y'all
@_date: 2018-01-09 23:54:41
no, it's like saying he didn't believe it to be a viable project

I sold my BTC position, because I think the tech has been outpaced by other coins. That said, I hope it really does hold as the new gold and all of you become perversely rich, and banks are forced into a more competitive market.  
  
go get 'em

that's an interesting point on BTC. Once the volatility settles it could be a strong store of value - but wouldn't PoS counter this for coins like ETH?  
  
For Monero - if it becomes illegal, yes it could become more valuable, in the same way all blackmarket wares are, but the risk is enormous. At that point we're literally talking about committing crime for profit. Also, the transactions within Monero maybe invisible, but once you try to pull it out - it's back on the grid, no? There would be a trail of user converting xBTC from Monero.

that's interesting.  
  
so then, say an account in question has a record indicating a possible atomic swap from monero - i would assume the first thing the state would do is say "where is this from?". Then there would be no counter-record from another legitimate (legal) chain, correct? essentially a smoking gun?

I could see this too, with a few notable large variables:  
  
What point is a store of value (BTC) when someone could store that value in any other coin they had? Stability with growth seems to be the only reason to store value, which is very different from today's BTC.  
  
Monero - I love the concept, but given the beacon it is/will be for money laundering, I could see it being made illegal and/or a high risk of funds being seized. It just is positioned to piss off the state so much.

I'm not seeing the cause for alarm bells - why would I conceal (read: from the government) my digital currency holdings for non-criminal reasons?  
  
the taxman is already going to come down on people not properly claiming these gains. I'd prefer the tech not be used to launder money.

i would think the same way they seize all illegal funds/wares - catch you with it and take it.  
that may sound oversimplified, but if someone is being investigated for money laundering/trafficking, there are ways to catch them red handed. they caught mr.silkroad with his laptop open and logged in, right?

*reported  
  
Edit: I mean reported crimes, not post reported.

nah - i can't explain why BTC should keep going up, so it's the same to me as putting it all on red in vegas. might work, but it's only me betting. i invest in tech where i understand its place in the market.  
  
same reason i didn't buy into Tesla when it went below 200 about 3 years ago. I didn't know anything substantial about the company's finances, only that "I think Tesla will do well." To me, that's gambling, not investing. I don't enjoy gambling.

Huh, I placed it at 176,240. Where’d you get the extra one?
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:34:53
Man it hovered in the $8999 ballpark then shot up to almost $9100 in seconds!
