Fuck man. I wish I did the same. I accidentally told my coworker I had a whole coin like 3 months ago and now it’s like they say sarcastic funny hating shit all the time now. “ Next bill gates” “Super rich” “thousandaire.” It’s pretty exhausting and sick to see how people treat you differently once they find out you have some change. I haven’t told my parents or brothers yet
