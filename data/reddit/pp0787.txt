They are talking about transaction fees, which you pay when you transfer a cryptocurrency.

I feel shitty cuz i bought some more today at 14,500....should’ve waited a bit more and could have bought even cheaper

Haha...he for sure owns a 5 bedroom on Silk Road Dr.

I have a lot invested but one thing which Bitcoin has going for it is that drops are not something new to it. I read somewhere that on 5 previous occasions it has lost as much as 80% of its value on a single day(Ethereum takes the cake here as it lost over 99% of its value on a single day) . This sort of checkered history gives me a slight relief in a weird kinda way.

Have people forgotten the time( earlier this month, just a few days back) when Bitcoin made a move from $12k to $19k in a matter of hours. Guys did not have time here to make memes and you are worried about a $1000 drop from yesterday?
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:52:03
Remember it like yesterday
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:42:42
They didnt knew as you were 2 years ahead of your time !!

Buy it fast before the price reaches stratosphere again
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:08:40
I still buy it for 50 cents in my dreams...though thats not gonna happen in this lifetime now. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 04:23:17
Absolutely, that was my first thought too. If every non investor is predicting that its a bubble then maybe its safe to assume its not.
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:09:56
Just do a simple Bitcoin news search and be surprised by the negative news surrounding Bitcoin everywhere. Its as if every major news organization and bank is working overtime to spread FUD among the masses.

May be a team of Hal Finney and Nick Szabo

Well there aint no other option apart from these two

Transfer to some other wallet/exchange/vendor to buy some stuff/other cryptos etc.

And the man that Newsweek claimed was Satoshi(Dorian Satoshi Nakamoto) lived a mere 2 miles from his house. That cannot be a coincidence.

I sold my entire bitcoin  thinking pretty highly of myself as a fancy day trader...just 2 hours later rally started which still hasn’t ended and i am just watching the memes now on reddit. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:44:04
Yes...i had 1 bitcoin which i bought at about $10000...then i sold it around 7 dec thinking of profiting from day trading, and then the crazy upward rally started...i bought and sold fractions after that(all at a loss). So, in my experience if i had just hodled up, i wud have more than20,000$ at current prices while i ended up with a minimal profit. So,yes hodl is the best.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:33:29
Yes, just dont sleep tonight. It might be a long night tho.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:34:14
‘Barely any utility’ ?? I am pretty sure that if Silk road was still running today then Bitcoin would have reached $10k a long time ago. The authorities wanted Bitcoin dead but the power of this technology always finds a way back.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:37:03
Bitcoin might fail but the future is definitely not Fiat. A 100 years from now we will definitely not have paper money and given the rate at which society progresses as a whole, this will come even sooner. Governments will try to regulate everything, but there will always be trendsetters like Satoshi Nakamoto and Ross Ulbricht present.
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:08:35
So basically until the other exchanges allow you to withdraw the other currencies in fiat money, your fortune is tied to the price of Bitcoin.

How i wish silk rod was still operational !!

I saw Cardano go upto 14 billion in a few weeks. This is unreal.
@_date: 2017-12-28 07:00:43
Bitcoin may very well be a bubble but with all the pundits claiming that it has already peaked and will only go down from here is very likely not true. I am pretty sure that it will go much higher. If at that point it pops up and comes down by a huge margin, only then it would have been established as a bubble, certainly not now.
I read somewhere that high mining fees were responsible earlier for bringing the price down during earlier “bubble” pops

Ask Roger Ver, he’s a nice guy who doesn’t believe in Bitcoin, shouldn’t be a problem giving away what you don’t believe in.

Thats my car. I just bought 0.3930 bitcoins today.
Now stop following.

How do we interpret this chart ?
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:59:28
Suppose i have 1 bitcoin that i brought through coinbase, if i log into GDAX now, will i be able to see that 1 bitcoin there ? If yes, will i be able to sell it on GDAX and receive money in my bank account already linked with CB ?
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:01:37
Coinbase. You must be new.
@_date: 2018-03-19 14:39:30
Satoshi would be proud of you.

Yeah got a cash advance fees of $20 for purchasing $100 of bitcoin

Makes sense. Either call it a 62 % correction or do not call it a 556% increase. Increase and decrease must be on comparable timelines.
