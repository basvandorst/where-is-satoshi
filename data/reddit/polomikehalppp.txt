Dave has been around for years. He tried and failed on a wallet of mine from 2013 as well. He is legitimate though, check bitcointalk. Been doing it forever.

Sounds like a fun time! Where was this? Anything interesting that you learned about them as people?

Identifying someones true motivation is as simple as seeing if they measure the price of alts in satoshis or usd.

Bitmex, Bitfinex, Binance, Okex are all beyond US jurisdiction. Bitmex doesn't even have KYC and has 10x more volume than any other order book, allowing up to 100x leverage. These are the top 4 exchanges by volume.

Still no yubikey support though.

You'll never get anything but a biased narrative.
My narrative is BCash is afraid of lightning network. Settlement takes place on the base layer so it is beholden to the security that the base layer provides. I've been watching this unfold for many years.
@_date: 2018-06-14 22:49:28
BTC is the OG. Without bitcoin you are introduced to endless forks and no scarcity. All BTC has to do is continue to be BTC. You can't fork, clone, or improve upon that.
@_date: 2019-08-28 01:50:51
Coinbase is a pretend bank. Who cares what they do.

Yea that is literally the entire point. And it will happen. And without an ICO. (lol)

So if USD becomes worthless so does oil and gold? What you are saying makes no sense to me.

Wait, maybe i"m being silly right now but then what is the peg of the basket? I'm sure causing a good laugh here but it isn't making sense

To which address should I send my medical bill for the cancer I was exposed to?

The fees are as low as 1 sat right now and adoption of segwit and lightning make it incredibly unlikely that fees ever bubble anywhere near ever $10 again.

The block reward halves regularly with another coming up soon. It is working as intended.

Describe to us your vision for a superior global currency candidate if you wouldn't mind. The accumulation of BTC by various entities is based on transparent and fair economic principals. BTC is infinitely divisible leaving no shortage of translatable units. How would you suggest this situation is improved?

The best part of this whole thing is how XRP got cucked into being the most elaborate and expensive testnet of all time. The XRP community really believed that the banks were going to buy their bags and make them rich instead of just cutting them out of the equation.
@_date: 2019-04-08 15:43:00
I was just debating a friend that shills EOS about this. I need some more ammo to explain in clear technical terms. I've got ammo, I need extra.
@_date: 2019-04-08 17:31:00
Can fork. Keeping BTC down holds them all down. I understand this is getting very conspiracy theory just entertaining wild hypotheticals.

@_date: 2019-04-08 16:50:50
Impressive awareness ratio.
@_date: 2019-04-08 16:31:33
I appreciate that, and it largely aligns with the way I try to explain things. I've been here for 8 years following the technology well before there was any serious money to be made.
It is hard to explain to people holding tokens with ICO origins what that financially-neutral standpoint feels like.
I feel like Bitcoin becomes a punching bag for the most technically ignorant arguments seeking wealth overnight.
@_date: 2019-04-08 16:37:59
But once you buy it all how do you get more of it? It is completely worthless at that point too. It is cheaper to just shove it down before a serious wave of people start rejecting the system you control.

Are you sure about this? How did you come to that conclusion?

Seems we agree.

We don't assume guilt, we prove it or we don't. This is a fundamental tenant of our legal system. Who are you to act as judge and jury? Nobody.

Those charges were dropped. 
@_date: 2018-03-27 09:43:33


You have tried and convicted him of charges unilaterally. He was not charged with or convicted of such things in a court of law. What more do you need to see to provide him with the presumption of innocence?
@_date: 2018-03-29 07:27:10
Yes, but it would be pretty irresponsible to not cash out the btc immediately. 
@_date: 2018-03-02 10:49:40
The first mover status of bitcoin is an objective truth in an ocean of subjective tribalism. It is the only characteristic of any coin that can never be imitated, iterated upon, cloned, forked, or be challenged in a debate of merit. Without bitcoin, cryptocurrency has no scarcity. 
@_date: 2018-03-25 16:18:56
Convince me you are somehow an expert worth listening to. 
@_date: 2018-03-16 07:37:05

Keep all details to yourself. You have a multibit classic wallet file on your hands. Google from there.

@_date: 2018-03-25 14:38:15
I don't really see an issue with the off-chain mechanics of lightning since the second layer would ultimately be beholden to the settlement layer inheriting all decentralization and security characteristics in the process. 
@_date: 2018-03-27 09:38:04
Certainly this single post on reddit will impact market sentiment.....
Look at yourself.

I can't buy groceries with gold either. Gold still holds value. 
@_date: 2018-03-05 09:46:50
It matters primarily to establish the cost basis of the 2 BTC for tax reasons when you cash out. I would just put the fair market value of 2 BTC at the time of the transfer as the price. 
When you sell or trade the BTC, that will be a taxable event where the cost basis matters. Just keep accurate records and you are good. Don't fudge numbers here.
@_date: 2018-03-29 10:41:46


Well, yes. I can't easily buy a car or house or pay off debt in BTC. If you aspire for more, what exactly does that entail?

Sold enough recently to cover my expected tax burden resulting from 2017 sells to purchase a home, pay off all family debt, and buy a vehicle outright. Still holding well over half.

lol are you serious? get outta here man, that isn't how this works.
@_date: 2018-03-27 10:57:08
Sure, on a personal level you can do that. Everyone has a right to their opinion. To presume better judgement than the courts in such matters is entirely arrogant and in poor taste however. Just my equally valid opinion in support of our well established societal norms. A shameful approach indeed.
@_date: 2018-03-28 23:26:25
Looked into basic attention token? One of the few projects in the space that I really like outside BTC. I wonder if it would be suitable for content creators somehow.....
@_date: 2018-03-25 13:13:34
I think this is a fair interpretation. Until the channel is settled on the btc chain all activity within the channel exists in a state that is less than definitively immutable.
@_date: 2019-01-05 22:28:06
What is racist about pointing out the reality of having no state? Get real. There are reasonable limits to your ideals.

Yes they take US customers. It is unknown but unlikely that they report to the IRS, and no you cannot deposit or pull out fiat  on the platform.
Have you never used binance? It is arguably the highest volume exchange in the world. OkEx has high leverage margin trading and has been accused of falsifying its volume with good evidence:

Andreas has been educating audiences, viewers, and governments on bitcoin for almost as long as it has existed. He wrote the book "Mastering Bitcoin" which is essential reading for any developers looking to work in the space. The respect he has earned is second only to the likes of Satoshi, Szabo, Finney, and [insert bitcoin legend of choice here].

Yes, Bitmain controls Antpool, BTC.com pool, and Viabtc pool which collectively are close to or exceeding majority hash power. The concept of decentralization is at risk here. This is no trivial matter and Bitmain is a bad actor. However, I want to bounce some thoughts off the community here. Under the assumption that any attack would shock the market:
1) Why would someone with that much hash power attack the very thing that generates profit?
2) In the event of malicious action why would the mining community not shift resources to another pool to protect their own profits?
Read my post history if you doubt my sincerity.

You mean paid shills. There is no such thing as a crypto expert, and if there was, they wouldn't be sharing their knowledge with you on youtube.
