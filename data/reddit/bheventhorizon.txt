I'm concerned that the auto-login or unlocking  - without any password or other authentication (fingerprint, iris scan) tied to the fob owner - would be risky. The scenario I imagine is someone knocking you to the ground, grabbing your fob, using it to start your car, driving to your home and taking that Renoir you bought with your bitcoin windfall. Note I didn't say the assailant would use your fob to take cash out of an ATM because I'm assuming cash will no longer exist!
Also, with the block chain approach if you forget your private key, you're in serious trouble. I'll assume the fob is only used to gain access to your devices and locks and that something else (if you want to use the blockchain for this too, smart contracts ethereum style?) establishes ownership. And that with ownership established, you could get a new fob, etc. (like getting a second key for your car now, a pain but it can be done).

I can't speak for Bruce but I don't think his goal was to say "Eureka, we have a way to replace fiat, here's the proof!" 
I got the impression he was trying to demonstrate the potential of bitcoin. If someone had asked you, say five years ago, if you could send money (or gold or a stuffed toy, something of value) to 80 people globally from Alaska to Zanzibar in 15 minutes from your computer for a tiny transaction fee you would have probably laughed. And rolled on the floor if you were told you didn't need to know any personal information about the recipients.
Now, instead of laughing, we raise our eyebrows and say "hmm ..." and start imagining the potential.

The Paypal fee is zero if you are sending or receiving money from friends or family - but only if the money comes directly from a bank account. Keep that in mind when sending/receiving. 
Still, I completely agree with everyone's sentiment here, namely that crypto will be the way to go - hopefully sooner rather than later.

Get your BTC out. Then run, don't walk.

Hmm ... then maybe BTC should just split 1000:1 so the nomenclature can remain the same. Instead of mining a total of 21 million bitcoin, 21 billion would be mined. Instead of 25 bitcoin mining rewards there would be 25000 bitcoin awards.
And a slice of pizza would cost about 3 BTC.

btcnr, "stupid" may be too extreme, a person who hasn't read up much on computer security might be surprised to find out the following (without the quotation marks) passwords were cracked after being told to pick 8-10 words or a mishmash of symbols:
"I like it. Have always loved the eagle with our symbol"
"Ph'nglui mglw'nafh Cthulhu R'lyeh wgah'nagl fhtagn1"
"allkesh is right.We have to move foreward."
"i m from germany searching kontact in german language"
"maybe anesthesia after visit of dentist..."
"the Montana crew gets the garage though right?"
Also, note a common keyboard pattern used in passwords:
