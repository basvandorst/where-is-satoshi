Bought 1 in mid December, still hold what I don't spend.

This applies to centralized fiat, not BTC.
The rules of fiat currency do not apply to decentralized cc (crypto). All governments will need to treat cc differently for it to be implemented in their economies. The world economy of cc is entirely deregulated because it is decentralized.
should definitely be a thinktank for how we move forward, and not just to the moon posts. That's what doge is for.

That's a bit pessimistic yeah? What about the ease of online transactions?
@_date: 2014-03-30 20:57:23
Excellent work will you be adding more exchanges like coinbase?
Also is this app on git?

And an open door for another crypto

True, but then you're trusting a third party with your credit. Many people may not understand the security risk there. 
With bitcoin, it's just as easy, but without the third party. Now the only thing you need to trust is your computer and the receiver will not be able to access your private key, so the only thing they could do is send the money back.
Your credit card numbers are not encrypted, and if the same fraudulent purchase laws applied to bitcoin, you would see an incredible amount of security measures in place for merchants because of the financial liability of being hacked.

The interest on your card is cheaper than transaction fees?

It's not *that* they can tax it, it's *how* they tax it that matters. The IRS should tax it under new crypto laws. It's not a currency from another country, so foreign currency laws do not exactly apply.
What the government should do is tax it on the average annual exchange price.
As for pulling us out of a recession, we do not need to eliminate fiat currency. We just need to recognize Bitcoin as a new electronic currency. It is new technology. The real problem is that this technology is threatening wealth in the higher tax brackets by taking value from the USD. To which I say: So?
Cryptocurrency is not going anywhere. The blockchain is a technology that could be taught as a fundamental breakthrough in computer science in the coming decades. It eliminates the middle man in electronic transfers of wealth, and assures that the wealth is a true and valuable asset.
How can the government just ignore that?

Yeah I edited my first post my mistake. 
My point is that this tax code bullshit will come and go like all things do. I think if we started treating it less like like a commodity and more like a currency, we would move forward as a community. As this community grows, as will its influence. 
New laws already need to be written surrounding cc. But where we stand, those laws are not written yet. As we move forward - and I think people who *truly* believe in bitcoin will agree - we need to push for its *use* not for its *price*.

Which makes it a better store of value.

If i found your card on the ground, I could use it. If I found your paper wallet, I couldn't.
@_date: 2014-03-31 10:18:22
Maybe that's because we're all so obsessed with its price index.
@_date: 2014-03-31 10:50:45
That is true, and I can see a tax revolt on the horizon if nothing is done about mega corporations paying little to no tax.
I don't think this tax thing will go away overnight, and it certainly is not good news for the average bitcoiner. However the complexity of it may cause either an iPhone scenario where people leave the country because of its bitcoin policy, or many people to ignore the code and pay no tax on any bitcoin related purchases.
Perhaps a new white collar bitcoin black market is coming for tax evaders wanting to buy a house or car anonymously.

lol troll account
@_date: 2014-03-31 07:09:22
Cool stuff man I was not aware that coin base was not an exchange
@_date: 2014-03-31 10:34:25
If you hate spending your coins, why do you have them?
@_date: 2014-03-31 10:53:48
That's a debit card not a credit card, and that is another third party with your information sitting in a database.
Edit Also if I found your card I could walk into walmart and buy whatever the fuck I want with your money.
