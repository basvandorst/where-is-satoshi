Yap, I know this method, I'm waiting for gdax to verify my Id and can check if I really have that balance or not. Thanks for the help.

*”Coinbase then created a transaction to spend the balance (0.00441718) to the address you asked it to (19Q5D...) minus a (steep) 381.51 sat/B fee of 0.00085839 and the mystery 0.00003016 BTC to 1M9Rq5b...”*
Here is the issue I did not ask coinbase to send it to that address. It was already made as a payment/transaction as soon as the 0.00441718 btc arrived.
I only wanted to check how much would it cost to send this to an exchange site’s wallet and then I realised that there have already been made another transaction, did not even clicked on the next button.
Coinbase aztomatically forwarded my incoming funds to two another address what I don’t even see in my address history. :(
Seems like I should open a ticket, question is how long would it take for them to answer it.
But thank you so much for helping me and analysing this cluster ***.  :)

So when I sent out my BTC from my Hardware wallet (0.00452100) to Coinbase it already took some, the 0.0001 BTC/Kbs and that's how the amount of the $75 worth of bitcoin came to me (0.00441718 BTC). So this is the fee what goes to the Hardware wallet's company.
One of the addresses where the last transfer went is coinbase's *"storing fee maybe?"* (0.00003016 BTC) the other one is actually mine (0.00352863 BTC). And the transaction fee (0.00085839 BTC) is the miner's who "transported" my bitcoins to me? So if I'm right is it always going to be a *"hidden"* fee? And why does my wallet show me the 0.00441718 BTC amount instead of the real amount I have? I'm still confused. I know I might sound stupid, but I just started to get into it and already got the basics and tought I know everything but now I just see these *"random"* fees and it's kinda confusing.

On my coinbase wallet it says I have 0.00441718 btc and when I want to send it it says I have to pay a 14usd fee.

So this is coinbase's fee? And when I just receive a payment to my wallet it automatically "transfers" it to their addresses and only subtracts it when I send my btc to another wallet?
