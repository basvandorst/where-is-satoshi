Well, if you were part of the company that did customer support for Mt. Gox as a whole you all were the *WORST* customer support I ever dealt with.  Yet at the same time I'm very happy you all were terrible because I deleted my account at Mt. Gox and avoided a potential financial catastrophe. 
I guess I'm saying thank you for being a shitty customer service rep because you kept me from losing money.

That's reassuring.

That's an interesting conspiracy that I think could be plausible.  It's far easier for organized crime to steal from an exchange like this than, say, the NYSE.

This is my concern as well.  I created an account and was in the process of being verified before I cancelled my account.  I regret doing that now.

Whoa, how did you know?

I read earlier today 1 out of 5 companies in Japan have at one time or another paid off the Yakuza.

Regardless of whether there is an announcement this is an improper way to handle it.  I'm so glad I didn't invest through Mt. Gox.  Waited a while to get verified and then cancelled my account when it took too long.  
I actually feel badly for all of you who lost.  I think the concept of virtual currency is great but there are no measures to prevent this from happening again.

A Yakuza shakedown seems far more plausible to me than some of the other stories out there.  If Karpeles was already making money hand over fist why kill the golden goose unless one is afraid for their life.

Agreed.  The problem isn't with Bitcoin or other virtual currencies.  It's with a particular exchange.

Thank you for the clarification.  I think what happened is awful for so many of you.  I'm glad I didn't make a deposit but I have concerns about my personal information I submitted for the purpose of being verified.  I guess it's Lifelock for me.
