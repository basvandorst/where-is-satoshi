It may look as a spam but i think it is standing and supporting my project that is constantly removed. I don't have another account and i know it is difficult to gain trust but noone is legit until he proves himself!

1 person posted that this must be a scam! rest of them are discussing about the project so i can get some feedback. As i posted "I will provide more information about myself, project details and web page as soon as possible" although most people posting in here are anonymous. Anyway i will consider what you said but my problem is that this community is really open for those who already have gained trust not giving a chance to a new member like me. Thanks

And what do you propose? To start my account now gain trust in 1 year and then post my project to get feedback and support?

What part says that it is vacation? its about trying to survive on bitcoins around the world spreading the revolution in every corner!

You may or you may not like this project but you cannot say i am begging for bitcoins. I am trying to fund this trip which  seems like vacation but the way i see it is as a bitcoin missionary as was mentioned to a previous comment.

Thanks for sharing your opinion! Is vacation trying to live only on bitcoin and why this is the first bitcoin world trip ever?
@_date: 2014-08-14 15:30:27
Its not vacation its surviving in a world 99% doesn't even know about bitcoin!
