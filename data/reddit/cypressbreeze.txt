You can do it with Foldcoin
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:22:47
Or better yet, SODL now and rebuy later.
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:22:04
Trying to time the market perfectly is impossible. Even if the correction happens in a few more days after reaching a higher price, making these kind of sales when the price is good is a very safe way to protect yourself from loss.
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:23:18
I absolutely agree with you. I believe in the tech, but with so many yet to be resolved problems, this price is driven more by speculation than actual worth. If anything a big correction before things get too crazy will be healthy for the future of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:48:39
Yeah, I say go ahead panic sell like crazy! If possible, at least 50% drop would be nice.

I'm not just easily believing what the video is saying. I am hoping for someone to explain a little better what the other side of the story is.
@_date: 2017-12-01 06:49:54
I posted this not trying to push this video as my opinion, but just sincerely to say "I saw this, can someone give me the other side of the story?"
But getting downvotes and sarcastic replies like this just shows me that people are just being stubborn and agressive.
I don't think "Bitcoin Cash" is the "real" Bitcoin. The world obviously chose otherwise.
But it seems to me that the real problem is the community on all "sides" has become too headstrong, too agressive, too stubborn, too unwilling to listen to opposing views, too easily upset, and too greedy.
Is it so bizarre that I would post an opposing opinion asking for more information and expect meaningful discourse?

@_date: 2017-12-01 07:33:36
Yes, thanks.
@_date: 2017-12-04 21:45:39
This satirical clickbait makes a good point that there are environmental issues with crypto that need to get addressed.
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:36:50
I sold all of my bitcoin right at the peak.  Now time to start buying back at a profit..
@_date: 2018-05-13 00:10:26
The article is bullshit. But I'm (barely) a millennial and that is what I'm doing.
@_date: 2017-08-05 05:52:45
Yess I is all da softbanks.
@_date: 2017-08-23 21:50:50
Can you explain how and why lightning nodes will be banks?


@_date: 2017-08-20 22:14:35
Can someone explain this? A Twitter post is insufficient.
@_date: 2017-08-30 21:48:59
I think it is more like, "[bitcoin] might even turn out to be the [successful] invention of a new kind of money!" (Implied words in brackets.)
@_date: 2017-08-23 13:40:14
I wish there was some way to get an unbiased summary of the conflict.
Edit: Wow! Thank you for the many great responses. It will take me a while to read through all of them. :)
@_date: 2017-08-05 07:12:36
Soft bank is a cell phone company. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 21:47:49
This needs better explanation. What are you talking about?




@_date: 2017-08-30 13:26:08
There is no explanation about DaVinci. But she does say something like, "It might be the invention of a new kind of money, huh, DaVinci?"
@_date: 2017-08-30 21:44:17
The only problem is that you offer support for so few other coins. Why not support Litecoin, etc? Do you have any advantages over your Japanese competitors like Coincheck that offer support for lots of alt coins?
@_date: 2017-08-05 08:20:16
Yes. This is the point where we all need to say thank you. They have all made our futures a little bit financially better. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 08:52:54
Hmm. Thanks for the info. I can see the good she the bad in that. Coincheck also has bad exchange rates and fees.
@_date: 2017-08-31 08:51:49
Thanks for the info.
@_date: 2017-08-30 21:15:18
I live and work here in Japan and I have to say that this is a gross exaggeration.  
@_date: 2017-08-30 13:47:56
Greetings from Japan.

About 7 pm. On a commercial during a famous cooking show.
@_date: 2017-11-08 12:57:54
The irony is here in Japan this video is blocked.
@_date: 2017-11-02 22:22:05
This is the most foolish attitude possible. This kind of attitude will guide crypto down the path to becoming a bubble. Adoption is so important. 
Anyway, the solution is just buy that much more litecoin now. By the time the album comes out, litecoin will have gone up in value and you will have a little extra litecoin leftover.
Edit: Litecoin or Bitcoin or Björkcoin or whatever coin your preference may be.

Best argument against Bitcoin Cash I've seen yet
@_date: 2017-09-07 09:25:28
I sure hope so. Forbes doesn't seem to understand it very well yet.
@_date: 2017-09-14 09:09:22
But the to the moon thinking is just as unsound of a philosophy as the fake news. We need to push for adoption, not speculation.
@_date: 2017-09-09 11:20:24
This is EXACTLY me this week.
@_date: 2017-10-22 06:44:33
I'm so tired of people posting endless lambo to the moon memes and not doing anything meaningful and productive to push for adoption or plan how Bitcoin can succeed in spite of all the recent hard forks and fragmentation in the community.
@_date: 2017-10-02 13:17:57
Pro-tip: save them both for later.
@_date: 2017-10-08 12:57:56
Wish this sub was less meme and more useful information.
@_date: 2018-04-30 02:35:35
Don't get me wrong, I think bitcoin is important and I think it will remain part of the crypto ecosystem, much like gold plays a part of the current financial ecosystem - a store of value that is not used much for everyday shopping.
I think it is a little unrealistic to ignore the significance of all these generation 2 and 3 technologies out there.
Regardless, only time will tell what the future will hold. 
@_date: 2018-04-10 09:51:41
I'm so confused. The logo is the Bitcoin cash color with the Bitcoin tilt
@_date: 2018-04-09 09:13:30
Yeah an Trump has more truthiness than any other president. Lol
What is this bullshit presentation anyway?Q
@_date: 2018-04-29 22:25:52
Of course.
@_date: 2018-04-29 19:48:14
This is why projects like iota and nano are so important. We are wasting too much energy mining Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-04-30 00:11:29
I think it matters a lot right now. The carbon footprint of society is already so far beyond our solar energy output.
Bitcoin is better than traditional banks, but with better solutions out there, we need to consider them or we are being just pro-establishment and narrow minded like the banks.
@_date: 2017-07-30 11:30:01
Zune is.
@_date: 2017-07-31 14:50:42
Yeah, that's the obvious outcome.
@_date: 2017-07-29 08:49:44
FYI Minidisc was HUGE here in Japan until Steve Jobs came along and drove them into extinction.
@_date: 2017-07-17 09:48:42
Did you already get rid of all your ez bake ovens? I'm looking for someone who takes Bitcoin as payment.
@_date: 2017-07-31 23:08:45
It's strange, no one really explains very well how to actually do this.
@_date: 2017-07-29 13:05:38
Well, that is what happened. Didn't you hear of that too?
@_date: 2017-06-14 04:44:05
I sincerely hope that the meaningful implementation of the technology can happen soon enough fast enough and successfully enough that it can keep up with the speculation bubble.
