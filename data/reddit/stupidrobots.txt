Can someone explain how something is "Not a real currency" if I can buy and sell things with it?

We're not that far.  We've been over 100k before and it's growing fast.  What happens when we hit that limit?

I own bitcoin.  I like bitcoin.  I've spent bitcoin and earned bitcoin.  I still really have no idea what the hell it is at a fundamental level other than magic internet money that is a big middle finger to big banks.

My response to "but nothing backs bitcoin" is "nothing backs gold either" and watch them go "b-b-but inherent value"
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:17:09
It seems like there wouldn't be a covert way of doing this though.  Like if some huge financial giant wanted to really get deep into bitcoin, it would be very public knowledge quickly, yes?
@_date: 2012-09-20 04:55:48
I drilled into a bitcoin and there was a worthless USD in the middle of it!  What do?

I would but I just struck up a deal with a nice Nigerian prince who's going to be delivering me a bitcoin miner any day now.
@_date: 2016-07-07 14:20:06
In an anarchocapitalist society you would likely see banks that use fractional reserve and some that don't.  The ones that do are engaging in a risk behavior that the others do not engage in, whereas currently all banks use the same risk because they themselves have no liability if things go pear-shaped.  By placing the responsibility on the bank instead of a federal reserve, silly risks like this would be removed.  This is why one didn't see too much of this sort of thing before the 20th century.
@_date: 2013-01-29 19:41:25
yeah it bounced off of $32
@_date: 2013-07-07 04:08:02
This billboard isn't helping.  It's just making bitcoin look like it's for a bunch of weirdos and nerds.  If you were to ask 100 people what the hell this sign was about, 99 would have no idea.
Something more like "Send any amount of money, anywhere in the world for free.  Bitcoin.  Plan B.  Learn more at  would be so much better.

It is an unholy mixture of private and public where the profits are privatized and risks are distributed onto the public.  It's absolutely the worst of both worlds.

How would a nigerian prince trade hundreds of thousands of dollars for bitcoins? 
@_date: 2013-02-22 15:28:24
as someone who has been bitcoining since 2011, this sure seems awfully familiar.
@_date: 2013-08-29 14:22:51
but wait I thought we'd need government to force him to do this sort of thing?
@_date: 2013-11-07 00:35:47
What a new and refreshing argument.
@_date: 2013-10-04 23:41:48
Well I was going to give you 30 bitcoins but now I guess I won't.
@_date: 2013-06-17 02:54:21
Sold when it hit $20.  Thought that was the peak.  Looked at it again and it was over $100

Noted. I just posted here because so far as I know, the Bitcoin is the only deflationary currency that has any traction on earth aside from things like commodity metals

Deflation would encourage people to spend money on things they need and not spend it on useless crap they don't because the money will be worth more to them waiting in a bank than on some spur of the moment gadget or toy.  When the market focusses on necessities like food, shelter, communication, education, etc then that's where the most competition will be, and that's where the most efficient production of goods will be found.  Thus, the poor/underprivileged would be main recipients of a deflationary system.
