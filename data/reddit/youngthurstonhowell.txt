It isn't working better. If Bcash had the same transaction volume as Bitcoin their fees would be much worse because they have less capacity despite having larger blocks.

Coinbase and Shapeshift are completely different services. Coinbase is an online wallet where you can also buy cryptocurrency and Shapeshift is just an altcoin exchange.
@_date: 2018-01-10 17:35:16
Just because Bcash has a larger blocksize limit doesn't mean it can handle more transactions. If they had as many users as Bitcoin they'd most likely have even bigger problems.
For example [Bcash block  mined a few hours ago by bitcoin.com, was nearly 8mb in size but only had about half as many transactions as a typical BTC block. You also have to take into account Antpool which caps their Bcash blocks at 2mb, and the fact that a lot more empty blocks are mined on BCH.
So in reality BCH does not have greater capacity than BTC, which is why Bitcoin Core has prioritized other optimizations that will be more beneficial in the long run.
@_date: 2018-01-30 22:00:13
They're using Coingate to handle all that. They don't accept Bitcoin 
or altcoins directly.

You are retarded. The original Satoshi client would reject Bcash transactions because Bcash is an altcoin that has replay protection. It's also on an incompatible chain with less accumulated proof-of-work.
@_date: 2018-01-15 01:05:23
Most of those outputs are for less than $0.10. That is not normally how people transact with Bcash. You can look at any normal block that isn't being purposely spammed like [this 7.7 mb block]( and see it still has fewer transactions than the average Segwit block. This is because they aren't using block space very efficiently and that's why I don't beleive they can handle BTC's transaction volume when you compare typical behavior on each chain.

No surprise they're also shilling Zcash. Roger is one of their investors.

You're not literally sending an email. You just type a person's email instead of a regular wallet address and Coinbase will credit that person's account with BTC. I believe PayPal works like this also.

Once you send bitcoin to an exchange they will send your entire deposit into one of their cold wallets and gets mixed with everybody else's funds. There wouldn't be any leftovers in your deposit wallet. The 0.00000104 BTC is just a credit on your exchange account, not the amount left in your wallet's address.

Bitcoin.com is scammy as hell. Ever post is paid ICO shill crap and trolling Bitcoin. Such a shame he is prostituting the Bitcoin.com brand so these ICO scammers can have the appearance of legitimacy. Someone else should be in charge of the domain.

Bcash wasn't actually banned from anything other than ICO fundraising. Your title is misleading.
@_date: 2017-08-22 18:56:58
There was already hundreds of altcoins out there before Bitcoin had scaling issues. Ethereum just made it easier for anyone to create an altcoin and profit off people's greed and FOMO. It is unrealistic to expect BTC to grow at a rate where it would be worth the tens of thousands of dollars per coin that Roger thinks it should be worth. High fees is only part of the problem and Segwit will help with that. Another issue affecting user experience is long confirmation times. No amount of on-chain scaling can give you near instant confirmation because it still takes ~10 minutes to mine a new block. That is why second layer solutions are needed and delaying or blocking those solutions has only contributed to damaging Bitcoin's user experience.

There's no demand for Bcash anyways. Even if they called it Btrash, Shitcoin Trash, or JihanScamcoin it would not affect their bottom line. There's no reason for exchanges to be politically correct and create confusion by calling it Bitcoin Cash, for the sake of one or two idiots who might actually want to buy this useless altcoin.

That's the same guy who was stalking me on twitter. He had blocked me after I criticized Roger and Fake Satoshi, but he would unblock me just so he could reply to my comments with links to stupid Blockstream conspiracy theories.

I don't know if Bitmain wants to do something like when they have an IPO coming up. If it's more profitable to mine BTC they will only be able to switch over the hashrate they own themselves and independent miners on those pools will stay with BTC.

The true Ethereum just like the real Bitcoin is decided by consensus. Just because a small minority of people wanted to keep the old immutable chain alive doesn't entitle them to keep the name, even if they did have the moral high ground.

[Here]( is some interesting information on the connection between Ayre and Craig Wright. According to Reuters, Craig filed Bitcoin-related patents through EITC Holdings in which Ayre is most likely a shareholder with the intent of selling those patents for "upwards of a billion dollars". This seems to be their motivation for pushing so hard for the online gambling industry to adopt BCH and dump BTC.

What logical explanation is there for why they would change their mind so suddenly? Is BTC(1x) going to remain Bitcoin and the forked chain will be B2X like they said 2 days ago? Or is hashrate going to decide? Or is it the market? Or is it market cap? Their first statement was definitive but now they are being vague and contradictory for no apparent reason.

They're not trying to stay neutral though. Two days ago they clearly stated that they would continue referring to the current blockchain as Bitcoin and the other one would be Bitcoin2x. Today they said that the chain with the most work would be Bitcoin but a few sentences later they say they're going to let the market decide. They've taken 3 separate positions that contradict each other.

And they also believe crazy conspiracy theories. And similar to trump supporters who believe the Bible should be interpreted literally they hold up the original whitepaper as if it were a sacred text and any new concepts that weren't thought of when it was written would be a violation of their God Satoshi's vision. The leader of r/btc, Roger Ver, like Trump is a rich narcissist who constantly tweets stupid things, is a pathological liar and is probably not as wealthy as he claims.

The Ripple token is a scam. It's 100% premined centralized garbage. There is no fair distribution, they just printed money out of thin air and gave themselves full control over the entire supply. It's not trustless because it only takes a few dozen validator nodes to change consensus rules.

Nova exchange seems like a very small exchange. They probably don't have the resources to deal with forks.

Bitcoin isn't printed from thin air. It's mined using electricity. Satoshi didn't just decide to give himself a bag of 21 million BTC on day 1. That's basically what ripple founders did with their shitcoin.

More people didn't support Segwit2x until Roger decided to come out strongly in favor of it. Before then there was near unanimous agreement that anything with Segwit was not real Bitcoin and 2x was a DCG corporate takeover.

It would not be possible to recover lost funds on Coinbase since they own the private keys and they have disclaimers stating that sending Bcash to a Bitcoin address will result in permanent loss.
As far as the address formats, a Bcash address can be represented in CashAddr or legacy format so it is still possible to send BCH to a BTC wallet and vice versa as long as you are using the legacy version of your addresses. Some BCH wallets have stopped supporting the ability to send using the legacy format but sending coins to the wrong chain is still a problem that exists.
