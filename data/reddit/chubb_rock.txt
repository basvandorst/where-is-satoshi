i assume their target market is the same as most financial institutions: consumers and businesses.
have you actually tried Circle?  i doubt it, since virtually no one has.  Nice FUD though.

i'm a xapo user (and a coinbase and circle user) and like what they have.  i also think their CEO wences casares has done a ton for spreading knowledge on bitcoin.  maybe i should just create burner accounts to post?

No one was charged a dime.  The fees were posted before anyone ordered a card.

i'd like to ask one question: does it actually work?  if so it is the only debit card on the market (ANX is a prepaid card).
if it works, can u send it to me instead of cutting it up because you don't like how it looks?

(sigh) if I park my car in a garage and leave the keys with attendent, does he own the car?  It's called custodianship, and there is a very large section of our economy based on it. BNY Mellon, for example, is a custodian of assets, they are not lending out those assets, anymore than the garage is renting out your car or Xapo is lending out your bitcoins or using them to pay fees. They hold them for you, but you own the bitcoins. Nor do they (or any other legal custodian) use what is in their custody to pay fees.  (Where did you get that one? FUD?)
As mind-blowing as all that may seem to you, it's actually pretty routine.  It's not bs, and it's not fractional reserve banking (which is what I think you intended to say ). Be careful about pantomiming all the torch and pitchfork rhetoric on r/Bitcoin before you know what you are talking about. 
As for how they pay the fees for you - I think they transfer money, as people do normally with other financial transactions. 
They are doing their users a favor.

You are 100% correct on all counts.
@_date: 2014-08-08 12:20:57
that is your Xapo debit card 
@_date: 2014-08-07 02:21:44
same question: does it work? if so, can have yours?  i'm not so picky about how the first btc debit looks.
@_date: 2015-05-15 02:32:41
um...no. but it does respect the right to privacy.

i think the Xapo debit card does have a chip, fyi

i agree with you on your fundamental point: it is about trust, not just of a custodian -- every financial system is based on trust.  when that trust goes away, you get runs on banks, currencies collapse, etc.  
but i think there is an inordinate amount of mistrust in the bitcoin ecosystem right now, so when a company actually offers to pay miners fees for their users (!), it's called "bs". something's wrong with that.
regarding multi-sig: it provides a great solution for a subset of the population.  it has a large voice in the bitcoin community but,  unfortunately, 95% of future users of bitcoin will NEVER adopt multi-sig.  Sorry, ease of use trumps being your own bank.  i am about as into bitcoin as anyone on earth, and even i don't want to deal with multi-sig.  if bitcoin ever reaches mainstream adoption, it won't be with multi-sig wallets.

they are paying the fees for you.  
holding the private keys for customers is not the same as owning them
