keep thinking some digital currency has more value than things like water/gold/silver
Human Value &gt; Material Value.
You can't use bitcoins for anything other than holding assets, it's practically worthless. 
Let me ask you, Can NASA coat their satellites in Bitcoin? Fuck no.

I'd never get into crypto, it's a scam, you morons over hyped a product that has barely been in existence for 10 years, and you morons say "ITS GOING TO TAKE OVER GOLD!!!! OMFGGGGGGGG" ...
The joke is, Gold has been used as currency since 700 BC.
You dumb fucks are delusional if you think some digital coin is going to overtake a metal that has REAL WORLD USE.
Bitcoin has ZERO REAL WORLD USE.

"if everyone" ... you do realize crypto only currently has 3 million users, right?
You do realize, there are 7,597,209,251 humans on this earth, Right? 
You do realize almost 50% of the planet doesn't even have power, right?
You do realize over 50% of the planet is starving and has no clean water right?
You do realize, the USA government has over 250 TRILLION dollars in assets and resources, right?
Again, Like I've said before, Pull that long black crypto cock outta your asses, it's obviously so deep it's hitting your brain and causing cock confusion.

I thought bitcoin was heading to 1 million in 2018?

I love how material value &gt; human value.
Jokes on all of you
Water is more valuable than anything on this planet. 
the fact morons are putting value on something that can't better a humans life, proves how mentally ill majority of humans are. 
I'll wait for the "B-b-b-b-b-but you can't spend water!!!" .. no you're right, it's only the fucking foundation to our existence. 
If you went to 3rd world nations and said
Bitcoin or Water, you bet your asses 1000000% of them would be begging for clean water. Not some useless "virtual monies!!!!"

tell that to the Chinese who steal everyone's shit and makes money from it themselves while screwing the developer 
@_date: 2018-01-24 16:38:10
keep trying? LOL.
I don't need too, Enjoy your Fake currency that has 0 insurance, and is backed by absolutely dick.
The United States Government has over 100 trillion dollars in resources and assets, the IRS alone brings in almost 5 trillion a year.
Yeah, The USD is going to collapse!!! OMFGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG
Also, Can bitcoin be used in smartphones/computers and about 1000 other things? Nope, Unlike Gold. 
So again, Have fun with your completely useless product that has been overhyped to get idiots to buy into it. 
Human Value &gt; material value. 
I'll make sure when shit hits the fan in &lt;50 years to give you a couple bottles of water from the freshwater lakes I own 
People who buy into crypto are just mad they're still broke as fuck after the 2008 crash. 
Also, Have fun paying those capital gain taxes in crypto, you think the IRS is going to accept some shitcoin? LOL NO. 
I can't wait for the day we start seeing NASA coating their satellites in bitcoin!!! OMGGG!!!! I can't wait!!!!!!! 
And Like ... OMGGG becky!!! I can't wait until they replace all the gold they use in our computers and smart phones with bitcoin like OMFGGGGGG INVEST NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
and like omfgggg i cant wait until we humans replace water with bitcoin too!!! LIKE OMGGG GUISE!!!! INVEST!!!!! 
Maybe go watch the shitcoin documentary on netflix and see how big of spammers bitcoin users are, they rented a building beside the New York Stock Exchange and they SPAM everyone, they stand outside and rape people "INVEST NOW" like fucking nigeran spammers, I can't wait for the FTC to start busting skulls, what theyre doing in New York is illegal as fuck, 
You think companies stand outside the NYSE and spam everyone? "OMFGGG INVEST INTO GE!!! NOW!!!" fuck no, because its ILLEGAL.

and I bet you run everything under your personal name, so have fun getting your ass pounded by whatever tax agency you have to deal with. 
And no you can't, you can upload in CAD, the transfer to USD, etc, stop acting like you can just goto coinbase and buy straight with USD, it's a pain in the ass in other countries. 
And no, I won't ever accept shitcoin as a currency, it's not, it's a valueless overhyped product that was marketed in a way to make people think theyre "fucking the system" over

Keep thinking crypto is going to destroy a financial industry that is literally running quadrillions in volume, Crypto barely has 3m users, go outside dumb fuck and 99% of the population could care less about some other currency.
Keep sucking that crypto cock. It sounds like your deep throating it by the truckload. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 18:18:21
Lol "Killing" ... What, making $200 a day? No thanks, I'll stick to my industry that consistently has made me 10,000%+ ROI while doing nothing and has about 500000x more reach than crypto ever will
And you're entire thought process is flawed, it's a pain in the ass to buy crypto in many countries besides USA.
And all that shit you talked about, only matters in the USA.
Go overseas where the majority of the humans live, and they want food, water, and housing, they don't give a fuck about watching big brother every Tuesday night at 10, they want power, they want clean water. You act as if 99% of the human population lives in the USA, the USA barely accounts for 5% of the planets entire population. 
You think people in Canada are buying crypto? Fuck no, Why would they? You can't buy crypto in CAD, you have to buy it in USD, and you realize how shit the dollar is? You're basically paying an extra $300 per $1k transferring it over. 
Maybe don't work a shit job, it's not that hard to pull in $100k+ a year these days, use your brain.

there is a difference between being a realist and a quitter, people who think BTC will reach 1m are pretty drunk on something, you can't have 1 thing have more value then the entire planets GDP Lol...
also bitcoin has bad scaling issues, plus fee's are stupid high for small transactions
