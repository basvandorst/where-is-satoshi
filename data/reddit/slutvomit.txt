Classic Bitcom

All of my friends talk about that openly (savings, income, investments, debt). I think a lot of people imagine their friends being more judgmental than they really are.

If you have any faith in altcoins, it would make sense for you to distribute a certain % among some of the other top 10s if that is your goal.

I bought at an all time high which then crashed by 30% and stayed low for weeks. 6 months later, I'd made 20g profit. Don't panic, just turn off your phone and check back in a few months.

Haha maybe. Always a chance.

I checked the top 10s a year ago and 9 of them are still top 10. While I agree with you, and 85% of my spread is in BTC, I think alts have a good future.

I don't have millions and I know my friends are all roughly the same class as one another evidenced by the fact that all of us have jobs and none of us have Ferraris.

That has to be one of the worst tattoo ideas I've ever heard of.

You had a kid when you were 16?

It's at a high of 10,000 AUD.
@_date: 2017-11-04 05:47:23
Says 10,000 AUD exactly at the top.

Bitcoin already is a standard

It's 10 years old dude. Loads of things take a long time to get going. I'm sure airplanes weren't the most consistent reliable things in the world in 1915 or whenever it was. There are multiple countries with *real currency* that are volatile and borderline useless.
I don't understand why so many people hate Bitcoin. No one is under any grand illusion that it's going to dethrone the USD, or VISA, or AMEX, or Gold. It's just a new way to think of value, and a lot of people are excited about it because it's very clear that there are tremendous problems with our current monetary system.

Maybe there is and I'm just naive that people are that deluded hahaha.

What do you use? I'm in Australia and I have no idea where to buy BTC without paying a 10% fee
@_date: 2017-05-31 23:45:07
Jesus, how much is it worth now?
@_date: 2017-05-29 23:59:25
I think that's because EFTs can be reversed up to a certain point but BTC xfer. What price did you buy on 8k? Sounds juiiiicy
@_date: 2017-05-29 23:09:18
Cool, thanks. What do you say when you go into a branch to deposit money?

I don't think you understand how tax works. :/
