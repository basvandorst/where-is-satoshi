Just lost my .01 bit coin there-- got the bonus...lost that too. 
Having fun playing there though. Though I'm broke, I may come back there one day to play a few hands.
Thanks for the service.

USD or any other stable currency...It's just a way of gauging worth of a currency. If 1 BTC buys a DVD player today, it may be possible that it can buy 4 of them next week.
Its volatility is proven.
 I'd rather sit and watch my DVD player turn into a hamburger, than miss out on it turning into a 50'' LED TV

Invest what you're willing to lose. That's the advice I've taken. I'm an absolute novice as well, but after just sitting back and watching for the past week or so-- the approach I'm willing to take is to spend what I can, when I can, and just ride it out. If you're gonna buy today-- sell tomorrow, you're not going to change your life with 2 BitCoins.

Honestly, I did expect a few trolls, but the lot of you seem to be mature guys who are genuinely interested in helping out. It's the only reason I even started this thread.

Gonna say what no one wants to be said-- but
When it levels out for some extended amount of time, I expect people to be more comfortable spending their coins.
But think about it...if I spend 1 BTC to buy something @ 68 Dollars today--- and it shoots up to 200$ next week-- I just paid ~130$ more than I should have for it.

Because no one ever did anything horrendous for "legit" currency like the dollar, right?

It's gotta be run by the same standards that most online casinos use. I was playing black jack and was getting the typical--bet low---win. Bet High-- get inexplicably bad beats.
