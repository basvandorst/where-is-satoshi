Is a Trezor's primary benefit in long term storage/protection, or does it have benefits in sending BTC with anonymity as well? Im new to this stuff too. Thanks

Thank you for the input. I will definitely save the list for the next time if I buy again. Hostile how?  
And I guess my assumptions with confirmations are correct? Takes multiple confirmations and can take a couple hours before being ready to use from wallet?

Can you please recommend a better wallet for Android? I actually found BitPay from that Bitcoin.org list previously, and I researched a little on Mycelium, greenbits, etc and most of them had various negative reviews. It's a little overwhelming trying to decide the "best" one. I am look for security and ease of use, no mining etc. Thank you.

I am going to send to another wallet soon, can you recommend anything for Android? I have looked at the BitCoin.Org wallet list (which has BitPay) and I researched before even getting BitPay and it seemed a lot had some negative reviews..

I noticed that there's lots negative reviews for just about every wallet. There was one limitation I came across with BitPay that freaked me out. I thought my funds were stuck in the wallet or something (im a noob to btc), but eventually got them out. It did the trick I needed and no errors, so I'll give it that! Cheers

Thank you very much for the explanation.  I am going to send outside of BitPay ASAP and never look back. First and only wallet with them for this 1  BTC purchase. Dammit...

I thought that was the case, and I did read about that Wasabi integration recently. Thank you!

Thank you very much for the input. The ATM is Coinflip which I read is really easy and has a good reputation. Is it possible to buy from coin flip then send to wasabi wallet and mix, then tails/electrum? Or do I have to buy at wasabi to get mixed? Trying to use cash if possible. Thanks again
