As of now, it is an alternative to the dollar and some view it as a commodity not a currency. If it begins to be accepted on a mass scale and people begin to trade with it globally it could definitely have a negative impact on the us dollar and other
 currencies.

BitBuy is ran by Justmake Inc. ( We are running the site to generate interest in bitcoin and help fund our enterprise cloud software. You do bring up a good point, it would probably be really helpful to display this on the website. We are going to add this now. Thanks

If the market continues to fall then it is a strong confirmation that a new bear market has probably started, with a final bottom around $250-300.

Justmake is a cloud engine that we are currently working on that will allow users to build software and apps using a user friendly, intuitive platform.
Once the user has built their software using the drag and drop tools we are building. The software is instantly available across all platforms and devices 
Our goal is to put the user in control of their software. Basically, we want to give the users the technical legos that will give the user the ability to build whatever they want!
We are a two person team and we need some help to get other developers and designers on board to help with the project. We currently have the cloud engine built and the front-end user experience developed. We need help pulling the remaining aspect of the project together.
If you would like to help out via bitcoin our wallet is: 1KNdbEDtH5vVvWKgnEMsfvSBxVEF1RN7GJ
Thanks to any and all that help fund the Cloud Engine!
