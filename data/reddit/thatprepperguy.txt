Hi, smurfmaster, my name is Evan Wilder. 
It's nice to meet you.
So, Japan has finally deciding on inflating your currency. I'm not surprised, considering they were the largest buyer of U.S. debt.
I personally don't think you should be transfering into Bitcoin or silver and gold until you get facts. 
I will present them here the best I can.
Bitcoin is a computer algorithm that allows anyone with a computer to trade with each other as long as they bring their U.S dollars as collateral. (Sounds like an iTunes gift card scenario to me.)
Silver, on the hand, was used by people and civilizations for thousands of years. Also, it's a depleting resource now. This is important because we have silver in almost all of our electronics. There's an industrial demand for silver especially because technology has a unprecedented use than ever before. 
Even if silver wasn't money, as a commodity, it will still be as useful. The medical community is experimenting with silver as a cure for cancer because of silver's anti-microbial properties. :D 
Outside of being cryptocurrency, what use Bitcoin have? Ask that for yourself.
I'm personally invested in silver bullion and I would never touch Bitcoin.
Smurfmaster, here's this for helping you.

Chris Duane is a good guy who make mistakes (like deleting opposition's comments - which in my book is NOT tasteful.)
I can see why literally Bitcoin is a malinvestment of my time (you can invest in Bitcoin if you want).
I've already seen the Bitcoin crash all the way to a mere cent. I will never bank my financial future on it ever.
But what misinformation is involved with Bitcoin? Please elaborate.
