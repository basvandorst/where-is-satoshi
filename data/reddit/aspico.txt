In this page  (sorted by Turnover), it seems clear that turnover is in SEK and not number of shares (because it's shared accross different ETN's).
Right now Turnover shows 6,000,000 SEK, so it should be 3,000 BTC (not 30k BTC)

I remember earlier this year some patents were filled by patent trolls. I think at that point Coinbase said they were going to file patents as well as a protective move. Am I misremembering? I cannot find what I am looking for on reddit.
