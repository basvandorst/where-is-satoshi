Sorry about that! My fault. We were migrating to another provider... hopefully should stop bouncing now. :) We stalk reddit and the web to find people like you asking questions though. Feel free to also contact us on r/bitspend!

Stay tuned..

Thanks for the review! I'm sure Justin will have more to say but I can say.. stay tuned.. :)

We'll be back ASAP btw! Probably within a week or so. Launching a lot of new security features and streamlining ordering and adding more anonymity features.

I think we here at [Bitspend]( were actually the first, from the [first grocery bitcoin order]( about a month ago.

Send us an email if you know anyone interested :)

Why not keep them as bitcoins until you're ready to spend, and then use Bitspend when you're ready?

Sorry, we already have a James.
Joking! Thanks for your submission!

By the way, we here at Bitspend are happy to order any products you need internationally as well. :)

James here from Bitspend. Can confirm no one here would do that. We have plenty of people loving us without needing to resort to such chicanery. Please disregard this obviously fake review and seek out the many other positive and natural reviews from reddit and the web abroad.

Another shill, probably a competitor. Please downvote. We want nothing to do with these kinds of posts.
@_date: 2013-03-31 14:15:28
Ja, dank der Wunder der Google. :)
@_date: 2013-03-17 04:58:30
Stay tuned..
@_date: 2013-03-30 15:48:53
This was not us, we swear. Please check the other comments in the thread. We suspect competitors.
