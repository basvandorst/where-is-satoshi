I have 4 oppened channels but I can't make a single payment on yalls or strablocks. This is the error I get : "parse error: Invalid numeric literal at line 1, column 4"

Nothing different from precedent debug.log.
I'm giving option 2) a go.

To skip the synchronizing blockchain phase I've copied the files from another node to my external drive (NTFS). When I launch my pi and check the debug.log it says I have to rebuild the database (-reindex) ... but the database is perfectly working on the other node. I don't understand why this happens since it is a perfect copy of the working databse.

I would like to make my IP public, any eclair.conf example ?
I added [this]( but my IP doesn't show up in the [explorer]( plus it says I have 2 channels opened where I actually have 3.

Option 2) worked.

[Result] ( with option 1).

I made a mistake, today's price is lower. Percentage is right.

AFAIK you can't. I edited coinmarketcap's html to create this table. I made a mistaske for devcoin, today's price is 2.805e-9 BTC ...

I 100% agree, past performance of October and November were the best.

Interesting, but it's not a measurement error. This change was 100% real and reflects bitcoin's volatility.

Every fiat is pumping bitcoin.

Many expected to have crypto dividends with B2X fork, since  this will not hapen investors are moving back to altcoins for better risk/reward chance. Anything can trigger a jump in bitcoin price (technical improve annoucement like lightning network, news like CME trading ...). Things move fast in cryptos.

It's a PC.
I'm using Kraken for exchange, it doesn't look like they're supporting UASF BIP 148. 
As for a wallet I'm using paper wallets, what will happen to my bitcoins once there is a soft fork ? It's a bit abstract, I imagine nothing happens to those coins until I move them ... It's the way I move them that will determine on which chain they will continue to exist, isn't it ?

I'm afraid I will miss the train, [this]( is too slow. Any tips to speed up the process ? I've already raised the database cache to 2000mb.
