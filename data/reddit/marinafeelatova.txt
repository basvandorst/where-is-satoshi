 crypto is not dead, maybe bitcoin will be dead soon but other coins, which use modern technologies of new generation, like CREDITS, EOS, Ethereum, will be rising up and rocking the market!The blockchain and smart contract technology remains intact. There was no Credits security breach, no superseding technology, nor any threat that renders CS, EOS and other cryptocurrencies useless. The supporting phenomenon that popularised cryptocurrencies in the first place is better than ever and represents an alternative to the legacy financial systems \(and other systems\) that we have in place today.

 *If we are going to solve societal issues such as extreme poverty or infectious disease, we need to make sure that every cause is getting the money they were promised, especially from the world’s most impactful donor group: federal governments. Credits claimed about blockchain, that it is very useful in medicine also. I think it is the future..*

 Smart Contracts are not a toy you give into the hands of people who have no training. As they need to be rigorously analysed procedures to handle value and trust. Formal specification initiatives of Credits are way more promising.

Dont you think that Crypto finally offer a way for us to control our own destiny. For the very first time in the history of the world, we have a way to generate and distribute money without a central power. People will have control over the money they rightfully earned. I wish only that BTC would have a better transactions speed like CREDITS for example.

Imagine having the opportunity to be part of the internet revolution in the 1990s. It was a perfect opportunity for you to acquire a vast amount of wealth and more importantly, bragging rights. The rights exclusive only to the initial investors and backers of the revolutionary technology, and that which could serve as your lifetime legacy. That recognition goes beyond material wealth and it really is currently at your fingertips. How many can claim the rights of being the few that took part in the development of a revolutionary part of human evolution? Very few. Cryptocurrencies are the gateway to that legacy.Such crypto as NEO, EOS, CREDITS, BTC etc...

 *With exchange offices closed, sanctions and the rial dropping like crazy it seems like a good idea to use Bitcoin. I know that there are a few people selling and buying Bitcoin in Iran with LocalBitcoins. For now it seems like Bitcoin is literally the only way to get money out of the country... but with the rampant inflation of the rial a lot of people won't be able to afford it. Also with BTC I owe Credits and NEO*

 Investing in bitcoin becomes old. Nowadays there are new blockchain technologies are coming up, they are more profitable, fast and easy to buy. For example EOS or CREDITS with much faster transactions speed and SC supporting

New investors are coming to our exchanges while existing ones are regaining interest after the drop because they’re getting good value and are making money as the prices of cryptocurrencies move higher. For example Credits.

The cryptocurrency industry is still small — the total market capitalization of all cryptocurrencies to date is about the size of one typical S&amp;P 500 company, according to CoinMarketCap. And as with any nascent trend, the risks are high.  Crypto finally offer a way for us to control our own destiny. For the very first time in the history of the world, we have a way to generate and distribute money without a central power. People will have control over the money they rightfully earned. I wish only that BTC would have a better transactions speed like CREDITS for example.

Everybody invests in crypto today... I ve chosen for my investments Credits and Eos as they are one of the most profitable

I think we have a much different payments in the future, we will use our smartphones to pay. So we need a very fast TPS and small fees, I think that Stellar or Credits currencies may take forward positions in the feature because of their tps

 Hello, i am newbie in cryptocurrency but want to earn some money. Is it too late? I think it would be good to buy Ethereum and Credits.

 *This shows that it is possible to deliver payments in a way that has never been done before – by directly swapping cash from buyers to sellers, resulting in instant settlements. Thats why we need faster tps which can be provided by Credits platform for example.*

 *Timed with the 2017 crypto bubble, 5104 BTC was turned into $55 million for charities. I'm happy and proud of the impact that will come, mostly thanks to the amazing charities and the dedicated people behind them. Also with BTC other cryptos are rising up too \( such as NEO, EOS, CREDITS, etc\).*

 *Any person who buys, sells, or otherwise transacts in cryptocurrencies, whether online, or otherwise, does so at their own risk and will have no recourse to the Reserve Bank or to any regulatory authority in the country. Investing is always a risk thats why pple should trust only to secure coins like CS or Neo*

Ye, Im totally agree with you!!
@_date: 2018-04-04 09:39:03
I think that this should be done a long time ago.

hey guys, i tell u that the dumb shit has hit the fan when one bleeding scammer calls out other bleeding scammer.
@_date: 2018-04-05 13:19:05
Well, I am a newbie and I ve invested in BTC, CS and EOS. What do you think?
@_date: 2018-04-12 16:32:08
So many talks about that Credits coins... Im ve really started about buying some too.
@_date: 2018-04-12 16:30:37
Me too thinking about adding that CS and EOS in my portfolio!

I think that they use an old type of consensus, now platforms should use a newer type of consensus - DPOS consensus it is the fastest, most efficient, most decentralized, and most flexible consensus model available now, some platforms like Credits and EOS alredy use it.
