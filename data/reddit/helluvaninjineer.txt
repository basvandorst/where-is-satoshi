It uses a dictionary of 2048 words, which represent 11 bits of a key. Then it gives you 24 words, which results in 264 bits for your private key, including a checksum. The odds of you ending up with the same private key as someone else in this method are 1 in 2^256, or 1 in 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007913129639936.

I have a word of caution for anyone who chooses to go the route of backing up their paper wallet online. I feel like BIP38 is given a bit too much credit in this write-up. The main security of paper wallets is that they're offline. Putting it online, even with BIP38, then makes it so the security of your computer and your choice of online backup, AND the security of your password used for BIP38, become the weakest link again. A keylogger can easily capture your password, and if you have a keylogger running, they probably already have your paper wallet backup, or a way to access where you stored it. To better secure against this, don't backup your paper wallet online, but instead physically place backups in several different locations. However, if you still want an online backup:
1. Keep the backup on your computer for as short a time as possible, and before putting it on your computer, name it something innocuous. I recommend changing the file extension as well so it doesn't stand out as a PDF (or other format). Renaming to .lnk would make most people ignore it entirely 
1. Upload it somewhere with excellent security and two factor authentication 
1. Do not save your login or password for the service you uploaded it to on any computer 
1. Preferably, the service you used is only to be used for this purpose and nothing else, so you're never logging into it unless you're retrieving your backup. This significantly reduces the risk that your wallet will be compromised from your end. 
1. DO NOT USE YOUR BIP38 PASSWORD FOR ANYTHING ELSE, PERIOD. If someone has a keylogger installed, they're going to try all your passwords for other services and combinations / variations of them to unlock your wallet. Your wallet password MUST be entirely random and independent of all your other passwords. 
Edit: I got some questions so I'll just go ahead and answer them here.  There's no particular reason to use .lnk, it's just a random inconspicuous extension I used as an example.  The important thing is to go with any one of a range of file extensions that don't stick out as something potentially interesting (.docx, .ppt, .jpg, .pdf, etc) and it would accomplish the same result.  Also, be sure to rename the file back to its original extension (probably .pdf) before you open it.

Bitcoin can easily drop to 0 and never recover, or it could keep going up significantly more. Any money you put in should essentially be considered lost or you should be using it to buy goods and services. In short, don't put any money in that you're not ok with never seeing again.

ANONYMOUSLY. 
Seriously, money changes relationships. Even if you think you are great friends with someone, they might view you as someone who won the lottery and thus can spare 10k. After all, it's only 10k, and you didn't really earn that money anyway. 
Seriously, tell as few people as possible.

Be sure to check out just from an asset allocation and investment standpoint, not a BTC standpoint. 
@_date: 2017-08-07 21:48:54
Just make sure you keep this to yourself and us random internet folk.  Good call using a throwaway, but don't tell people IRL that you have a BTC.  Sure, right now it's "only" $3300, but if BTC hits $1MM then you'll have people coming out of the woodwork asking for handouts.  After all, you won the BTC lotto and have a million bucks, surely you can spare 5 grand to help me out!
@_date: 2017-08-12 16:08:38
Probably under 15 million if you think about all the BTC that's lost forever. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 16:25:14
The thing here is it's easy to imagine HODLing back then, but in reality, if you bought $500 worth of BTC at $2, do you really think when it spiked to $70 you wouldn't have cashed out? It got there so fast and your $500 turned into $20,000....
Be honest with yourself. At the time that was exponentially higher than it had ever been and $20k is a lot of money for most people. 
@_date: 2017-08-06 02:50:10
Honestly that response sounds like what a 13 year old would think a smart person who knows economics would say.

This is better advice than blanket "always hold it yourself." 
Security is hard. I know because it's been my job my entire life. Some people are going to screw something up along the way and get unlucky, it's inevitable. For those people, Coinbase with proper security configuration will be less of a risk overall. Note I didn't say no risk, but less risk. 
If you're going to use Coinbase though, at a minimum setup 2FA, preferably via Google Authenticator. Make sure your email address also has 2FA enabled or you just shifted the vulnerability point. Beyond that, their more advanced options and cold storage are probably a good idea.

It's only just now starting to gain traction, and only in limited markets by places that have *massive* amounts of infrastructure built-up already like Walmart and Amazon.  It was 20+ years ahead of its time....and I don't think saying "well you were right, just early" to everyone who lost all their money on Webvan gets them their money back.
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:35:24
You can buy fractions of a bitcoin.  For example, 1 mBTC is only $10 right now.
In BTC, that's 0.001 BTC.  But it's not like the USD where the smallest unit you can have is $0.01.  It can be divided up much, much smaller, so even if you only have a small amount of money you want to put into BTC, you can still do it.
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:31:57
I bought the dip at 7200 and 6900. Then at 5800 I didn't buy because I figured it would go down more. Doh!

Assuming capital gains taxes, you're looking at $1.5 million.
That's $60,000/year in income for the rest of your life. Most, if not all, won't be taxed. Based on your current salaries, you could basically retire, or at least quit your jobs and do whatever you want. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:12:25
It's really the opposite. Most young people have debt that needs to be paid off to avoid as much interest as possible. And the opportunity cost of missing out on decades of compounding gains in regular investments is massive.

Would you put 75% of your savings into Lotto tickets? What about blackjack? Roulette?
As with anything, past performance is not indicative of future results. Just because Bitcoin is doing phenomenally well doesn't mean it won't go to $0 in a year.
By all means, buy BTC, use it, and HODL. Encourage others to do the same. But treat it as part of a balanced and diversified portfolio.
Buying Bitcoin at this point is similar to buying stock in a single Silicon Valley startup. Sure, we all hope it'll be the next Apple or Microsoft, but it could also be the next Webvan.

It's the same thing as investing in a single company's stock instead of mutual funds or index funds.  Only that single company is a disruptive tech startup in a brand new industry and they could go bankrupt at any moment.  Or they could be the next Google.

I have a strong background in mathematics (including introductory crypto) and computer science, and Bitcoin still hurts my head a little.  I *know* that it actually makes *more* sense than state currencies, as it isn't subject to the whim of a single person or group of people (e.g. The Fed and QE) but it's a bit different trying to get your brain to accept Bitcoin as just as "legitimate" as USD when you've known USD your entire life and BTC is just "some made-up series of numbers on the internet."
Yes, I understand scarcity, value/worth, and how it's both a currency and a method of monetary transfer, and I understand both State-backed currencies and Bitcoin, but it's still hard for me to tell my brain to accept it.  Given that and my background, until it has *much* more widespread acceptance (read: all Starbucks accept Bitcoin), can you really expect the general population not to act like that?
