Hallo Shapeshift, 
This is sad. Your service is realy good. But After this news i'm afraid to Do a timedout transaction to you, which was not going through because of not connected peers. Will i loose my ether, when i do a transaction is 10days old? 
@_date: 2016-04-18 11:07:37
wonderful idea.
- developer got ticket from opener with estimated amount of time to solve problem
- developer accept ticket
- developer close ticket and get automated money if opener accepts solution

that is an interesting project, but i think more to the direction of sharing your own bike, which is saved through a special lock. This lock can be opened through the blockchain. Therefore the lock has to be connected to the blockchain and there must exist a plattform who brings owner and the persons who wants to rent together.
Further it is necessary that the lock needs a power supply. right?
What do you think? is this possible?
@_date: 2015-06-22 15:32:09
Im going d'accord on this

@_date: 2015-06-20 19:55:38
The banks for the bitcoin are the music Industry for file sharing (or metallica for napstar)
@_date: 2015-06-22 15:29:38
looks similar to the idea i have in my head. I need a plattform where i can offer a bike for rent
@_date: 2015-06-22 15:30:25
thats definitly a topic to think about. are smart contracts a way to care about?
@_date: 2014-07-01 06:47:11
Sooo, this was my last bet. Thank for your information

@_date: 2017-08-18 09:31:17
I like hardforks. Everytime a small amount of new btc (After Trade) and a new upswing, when hardfork is done :)

yeah, i'm asking me the same... its like "ok people we have mail, we dont need email, sooo email is banned" ... but how can a government revoke the user from sending emails?`stopping internet? this is maybe possible in north korea, but not in europe.
2017 will be (finally) the year of Bitcoin. EY follow, Sweden follows, R3 is split up...  europe will understand in 2017 that they have to work WITH the blockchain technology not against this technology.

Wtf? If Bitcoin would be illegal no Business could officially accept it. If Heroin would be legal.... I cant imagine. But i'm sure we would destroy ourselfes
@_date: 2016-12-31 01:53:52
I guess everything was once in a time legal, because it was not illegal... I guess we have now much less addicted people 
@_date: 2016-12-31 01:31:04
Is this your Plan or your hope?
@_date: 2016-12-31 02:01:41
Or they will be merged somehow. But whats The Point? 
@_date: 2016-12-31 02:00:20
Rise from there sounds like a dream ;) but yes...  This would be The end
@_date: 2015-08-03 13:26:00
sounds very interesting to me. I found this paper: 
is this what are you looking for?
@_date: 2015-08-03 13:46:09
at the end zhang writes "Future study should consider the possibility of imposing a certain degree of regulation on
cryptocurrency. The regulation may help cryptocurrency defend itself from market violation.
The fall of the market of invisible hand could also be studied and be compared with
decentralised cryptocurrency and unregulated market."
is regulation still a important topic? :D
@_date: 2015-08-04 14:27:53
First of all thank your for your comprohensive explanation. I will do a literature review and will then talk to some research associates to supervise me. This is a very interesting and  tricky question.
@_date: 2015-08-04 06:38:19
hi targetpro, where is the problem? can you give me a hint, please
@_date: 2015-08-03 13:30:03
Would be a nice paper title "Why the blockchain matters", but what would be my research method? Literature review?
@_date: 2015-08-03 13:35:00
Both are very interesting topics.
1) I found the following paper:  is this what you are looking for?
2) Sorry, but this is not my business ^^

they can do plans to establish their own blockchain, but they can not kill the idea of an indepent and trustful electronic cash system. fuck you blockchain alliance you're doing it wrong.

Its a great idea! i uploaded a file and the process until done works brilliant, which includes account register.
Can you offer an API?
@_date: 2016-07-17 13:18:47
do you have an idea when it will be released?

I plan a informationsystem for a research group at the university of goettingen as student Assistent. I think about a document management system based on your functionality - fully integrated in our processes and projects. Opensource

Funny! Currently i'm developing in my master thesis a mobile application to support environmental behaviour and its name is "eCoin". :D
@_date: 2016-07-26 10:45:01
it is not relevant whether its a currency or not. finance crisis and wars will confirm the invention and benefits of bitcoin.
please don't get me wrong i'm no supporter of crisis or wars, but if you have a look at the current political situation, especially in turkey, it looks like there is soon starting a war (i know there are current already wars). but the bexit and the situation in turkey affect especially the euro and in russia the bitcoin is already a foreign currency. so i give a shit on the miami judge
