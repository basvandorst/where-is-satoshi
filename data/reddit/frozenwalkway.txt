Yup I almost started mining. What made me stop was how long it would have taken me at the time to download the blockchain. Hard drive space for games ugh lmao.

IDK when you can resell used cards for more than they bought them for a year or 2 ago it is sort of indicative of at least an aftermarket rise in price because of inherent value now placed on ability to mine.

It also wasn't so easy. At the time it included having to find someone in the real world to give cash too for bitcoins at least when I was thinking about it. I don't think exchanges we're trust worthy yet

Yep stock market will crash and Bitcoin will be ushered in by necessity as the global backup currency.

I learned about Bitcoin when it was trading for dollars. I could mined but my hard drive was almost full and it was 20+gb download for the block or w.e. 
I'm not bitter but low-key it was the worst mistake of my life

I'd rather just coinstar than do the work

Form a country and open a funeral home. Got it.

The problem I run into is most people have trouble with understanding regular money also.
