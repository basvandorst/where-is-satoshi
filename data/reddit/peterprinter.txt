Sort of funny that this article gets heavily upvoted when this sub is in a panic about a mining pool centralizing a lot of hash power...

So this was actually a quote from Professor Bitcorn?

A request: while the destination address has been provided with the instruction "find the origin", most of us don't have the patience or time to dig through the chain to do so. Nobody has apparently discovered the origin address (or at least has not posted it on the thread).
Can you just tell us the transaction chain so we can confirm for ourselves?

This is actually (1.5). They'd never let you make it to the port to leave...

$200K deposit required. Sweet.

Blockchain.info counts all blocks *relayed* by a mining pool as being mined by that pool; the mining stats page says itself that it's a "rough estimate". 
The bigger the pool is, the more blocks it will relay because it is super well-connected to the network and it will relay blocks to blockchain.info before that site receives them from the pool that actually mined them.
There are more accurate measurements for hashpower out there that actually do some analysis of where the blocks originated. Blockchain.info does zero analysis.

Yeah, there are ~170K of them just in those addresses and God knows how many of us have coins that went through SR before it was shut down. It was the largest mixer in the BTC economy for years... you can probably only safely assume that coins mined since it was shut down never passed through it.

Have you seen government procurement processes? I am not sure that even the NSA can keep up with private-market Bitcoin ASIC developments.
Not saying it's impossible, of course, but this isn't something NSA can just enter into a top-secret contract with, say, IBM for and Bitcoin is gone next month.

Dude, if wasn't afraid of the surgery, I'd totally sell one of my kidneys for bitcoin. 
They do say: "only invest what you can afford to lose", after all...

Maybe, maybe not. I'm sure most people thought Microsoft wasn't going to be displaced as king in 1998. I would say Bitcoin's current superiority is even more tenuous than Microsoft's.

The fact that GHash.IO is 50% on the blockchain.info mining pool stat page DOES NOT mean that GHash.IO has mined 50% of the blocks for a given time period. The mining pool stat page measures blocks *relayed* by a pool which is not a 100% accurate measurement. 
GHash.IO, because of its size, is well-connected to the node network -- probably better connected than blockchain.info -- and will relay blocks found by other miners before blockchain.info receives them from another node.
There are more accurate measurements out there. Blockchain.info's measurement is essentially as an uncritical spectator.
That said, we should be worried about the pool being as large as it is. We should NOT, however, be relying only on blockchain.info's stat page for our panics.

Um what? Pools are made up of individuals. If a pool's manager chooses option (b) and begins the attempt, individual miners could simply choose to leave en masse (because such a move by the pool will destroy the value of their bitcoin holdings and their hardware), thereby negating the attack and destroying the manager's business.

I wonder what sort of backdoors are just sitting in "open source" code that people use all the time. "Oh, it's on github, it must be okay."
@_date: 2014-06-10 15:58:05
People generally just inherently trust blockchain.info despite the problems it has been having lately. The company has been overextending itself lately and this bug is probably the result of the engineering team not being able to properly audit its own product and/or the management pushing an unfinished product to market for whatever reason.
@_date: 2014-06-09 18:42:27


I don't think that's what it was suggesting. I think it was saying that auditable yet trustless voting can be done on the blockchain (for example, by giving each voter one satoshi per office/issue and having the voter send his/her satoshi into the address that represents his/her choice).
Which is all well and good... but this process has issues of its own which need to be overseen by a trusted party (keeping track of fraud, making sure the network was stable at the time of voting, etc.). You can't just ignore the issues.

So we could than attack that pool as it gets close to 51%?

While CEX.IO sits on roughly half of the hash-power of GHASH.IO, it is *only* able to maintain that power -- i.e., by buying more ASICs -- because of the fees it extracts from exchanges on its platform. If people stop using CEX.IO, it will no longer get those exchange fees and will no longer be able to purchase additional power.
However, if people see CEX contracts as a way to "have your money make money!", it'll never work.
Edit: also, if people stopped using CEX, GHASH will be forced to start charging fees on its pool, thereby getting rid of the biggest advantage it has over the other pools.
