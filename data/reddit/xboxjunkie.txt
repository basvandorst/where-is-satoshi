It is not going to happen. If you had watched Facebook Libra hearings, you would know the US government doesn’t like a currency that it cannot control. It is the same for every government. The best outcome of crypto is to replace gold as hard reserve asset. Total gold market cap is 8 trillions while crypto is 250 millions. Even crypto achieves only 1/8 of gold cap, bitcoin should be worth ~ $40,000. That is my conservative target by the end of 2020.

Stock market is so boring compared to crypto world.

Why was the government so worried about a few hundred billion dollars bubble? The entire crypto market cap is smaller than any one of the FAANG stocks. It is peanuts compared to the scale of 2008 financial crisis. It wouldn’t create a dent on the world economy.

IRS want send and receive bitcoin wallet addresses too. Coinbase should keep fighting.

What is the chance someone else rolls the dice and gets the same private key? Will they be able to access everything in you address?
