I am trying to do it on my own using the website but it keeps telling me the account city is wrong.   All I did was copy and paste from Bitstamp, Reading, Berkshire RG7 8NN

Did same thing on yahoo.  Scammer got into my account.  Instant bought 10BTC and tranferred them out to some address.  Coinbase is saying i am liable for the $10k theft.

About 2 weeks ago I typed "Coinbase" in to Yahoo. The clicked on the first link not realizing it redirected to a phishing site and entered my credentials and authy but, it didn't let me on the coinbase site. A few minutes later I got an email that I had bought 10BTC and instantly transferred them to some location. I had very little BTC in my account (which also got swiped). Now Coinbase is saying I am liable for the lost funds. Spare me the lectures about not realizing it was a redirect. Btw, the phishing site is still on yahoo. I am also surprised that Coinbase has not published any warnings about this to make more people aware. The URL I clicked is gone but has been replaced by this one

I think my situation added to this change.   About 2 weeks ago I typed 'coinbase" in to yahoo.

When I did it on Decemeber 31 it redirected to "coinbaise.com".  Note the misspelling.   When I try it now, it goes to "  I did not try logging into this site for obvious reasons.   If you copy and paste that link, you will notice it is an almost exact image of the coinbase real site.   I notified them instantly of the breach so they could attempt to try and stop the transaction.
Also, the bogus sites ask you to do the 2 step authy, which I did.  They then use this info to log in to the real site and steal your money.
