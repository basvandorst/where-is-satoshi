It seems this system was signed into my personal nick when that post was made. 
"We" consists of ZIGGAP LLC, a Delaware Limited Liability Company. We're in the process of hammering out a card offering.

Hi ferroh,
It's a bit more complex than simply getting someone's card information and PIN. 
Using methodologies we developed in other high-fraud businesses we are able to get our fraud rate down very close to zero. We accepted traditional credit cards on QuickBitcoins.net for 6 months without a single instance of chargeback, and those are much more risky. The additional security offered by debit cards allows us to streamline our anti-fraud measures making them virtually transparent to the customer. This allows a safe and secure purchasing experience for consumer and merchant alike.

Please check the About Us page on our information site to read about the qualifications of our team. The biometric security consists of a fully encrypted laptop which requires a fingerprint and voiceprint to log into.
We are choosing MoneyGram cash deposits because MoneyGram is bitcoin-friendly and has an existing infrastructure that allow us to receive funds via cash from practically anywhere.
Also, we're talking about MoneyGram cash deposits, like what someone does when they pay a bill at a MoneyGram location. We're not talking about sending cash to a person via MoneyGram transfer. This is already exactly what BitInstant is doing excepting using a 3rd party company, ZipZap. You see all those different locations you can make cash deposits on BitInstant? They are all just MoneyGram locations. 
We're going to go directly to MoneyGram and get setup as a business that can receive payments, instead of a using a 3rd party payment processor like ZipZap to receive MoneyGram cash deposits. No middle men allow us to charge a lower rate. 
And yes, our rate would be the lower than any other major competitor, including BitInstant.
Thank you for your interest. I hope we have clarified our business plan a little better, and please don't hesitate to let us know if you have any other questions.
@_date: 2012-12-01 08:37:22
I've pinged him regarding this issue. I'll let you know when I hear something back.
@_date: 2012-11-14 15:45:29
Our rates would not be lower than Coinbase. Coinbase isn't considered by us to be a competitor. They allow you to buy and sell coins via ACH bank withdraws (eCheck) which require 3-5 days to clear and are easily reversible in cases of fraud. They also have a $100 limit on ACH transactions. We're going to be truly instant, with higher limits.
We also realize that people don't want to go out and have to pay with this for cash, which is why we are also going to offer the option of Debit-Pin based purchases. 
This will allow customers to purchase coins from the comfort of their own home for a slightly increased transaction fee of 5% compared to 3.2% for MoneyGram cash deposits.
@_date: 2012-12-31 13:37:02
We've sent some inquiries to PaySafeCard about getting registered to accept them, but have yet to receive a reply. Hopefully, if all works out well, we will be offering them at a much lower rate than any other current offering.
@_date: 2012-11-14 00:21:58
Hi Jesset77,
We never see the customer's PIN. PINs are entered in a payment page hosted and secured by our payment processor. No sensitive payment information will ever be stored on any ZIGGAP servers.
@_date: 2012-11-14 01:15:34
We have chosen to go with an online pin-debit system to significantly reduce or eleminate fraud. This reduction allows us to completely automate the process of accepting from-home card transactions.
We're still negotiating between processors, however both of them work with the PULSE payment network. The system is **extremely** secure. In fact, it's more secure than standard CNP credit card transactions.
Here is a short presentation provided by PULSE that explains the system, it's security features, and advantages.

This seemed to be happening in a single version of a single browser. This has since been resolved. Thanks!

Hi cosmicboy,
That section of our TOS is more about payment methods we're going to be releasing soon, and in order to prevent chargebacks. It's not as much about cash. We're going to tier the information we require based on payment method. For instance if you want to pay with upcoming methods you will have to submit more information than if you want to pay with cash.
@_date: 2013-03-14 19:06:38
Not at this time. I wish it was, but like you see a lot of places doing these days we have to comply with AML/KYC laws. 
@_date: 2013-03-21 01:25:28
Hey wrkDS,
If you have any questions about how it works don't hesitate to let us know. We've got phone, live chat, ticket, and email support available for you 7 days per week. We don't require any bank account info.

Hi bitcoinpharmacy
We're soon going to launch a Credit Card to Bitcoin website. I think a partnership would be extremely beneficial for both of us, and for Bitcoin in general.  
If you're interested in a partnership please don't hesitate to reach out to me at ryan [at] ziggap dot com
@_date: 2013-03-24 14:01:25
It says it right on the front of the website: NAB Cash deposit. 
Once registered create an account, Get Bitcoin, click NAB Cash deposit, then follow the instructions presented. You'll get Bitcoin in no time.

We're taking a look at this down. We've got this tracked down to an issue with the API our TNI provider uses. Thanks for your patience.

Funny you bring that up. That's something we're working on *right now*.

We don't define "terrorist". 
We don't label people terrorists. 
We download lists compare names. That's it. 
If you match then we decline your transaction and I get a ton of paperwork to fill out.
It's much easier to say what you are saying when you are not the one who's potentially subject to penalties in the event Uncle Sam decides he doesn't like Bitcoin.

Yes this is absolutely possible. Please just place an order on the site and it will walk you through the process step-by-step.

Sorry about the inconvenience. I know the process can be a bit frustrating when dealing with the clerk. Feel free to give us a call at 1-855-WE-BITCOIN anytime you need any help. We can walk you through the process step by step.
Keep an eye on our twitter and news feeds - We're always working on better ways to get Bitcoin.

Earlier today we were having a few issues with our ordering system, but that is no longer the case. As far as I knew we have had no issues with our phone system. I just tested it actually.
Can you please explaion how you were having an issue making an order? I would be happy to look into it and see what the cause of the problem is.
@_date: 2013-02-21 22:16:18
Out of an abundance of caution we check all people who use our site against terrorist and other watch lists. We're not required to do this, but we figure it's better to be safe than sorry.
Basically if your name is Bin Laden and your birthday matches we don't deal with you.

Where on their website do you see an option to buy Bitcoin with your cash?
@_date: 2013-03-17 00:00:41
No you should not call ZipZap on this matter.
ZipZap is a payment processor. That's all. They are the ones who take the payments, They receive the money and then their servers tell the merchant's servers (In this case BI) "Hey we got this money, you can send product now". To be more specific it's more like "Hey payment in the amount of $XX.XX received from customer number 12345678". Then BI's server goes and checks to see which order or customer that customer number belongs to and takes the appropriate action. After this ZipZap takes out their fee and does a bank transfer for the amount left over to the merchant.
So BI servers receive that message and say "Ok great, I'll go ahead and send over the product". If the money is received and ZipZap tells BI it's been received then ZipZap is doing their job, they haven't done anything wrong.
In this instance it sounds like ZipZap did everything they were supposed to but BI just never sent you your product. That's all BI, no one else. They are the ones responsible for sending you the product or a refund. You do not need to call ZipZap.

We would like to, but unfortunately this is against PayPal's terms of service.

As I've said before. This post was not made by ZIGGAP. If you view the original post you will see that the author deleted it immediately after, which was probably intentional. This way there is no way to verify who the original author was. 
Conspiracy? No. 
A single person who's attempting to discredit ZIGGAP? Apparently. 
@_date: 2013-03-20 01:49:29
Yes, someone will be available as long as you call during business hours. That's all you need to know! That account number is directly linked to your ZIGGAP account. After you make the payment everything is automatic. You don't have to contact us by email afterward. It will use whatever information you have saved on file. 
@_date: 2013-03-23 20:41:17
We're back!

Unfortunately we will not be implementing this in the near future. It's a pain, we know. We apologize about the inconvenience and hassle. 
We prefer to have a layer of manual intervention on both our part and your part in an effort to combat fraud.

So are you the person that made this post, Daniel? Impersonating someone can be considered identity theft. I advise you to stop.

Hey there,
While the site is back up, we're not quite back up and running quite yet. We'll make an official announcement when we are. As of right now when you try to pay at a location your money will not be accepted. 
Keep a watch out for the official announcement!

It's not as simple as simply taking someone's CC number and sending them Bitcoin. We have an advanced fraud mitigation strategy that brings our chargeback risk very close to zero. 
@_date: 2013-03-14 04:51:26
At the moment we're just waiting for approval from our Australian counterpart's bank. It can take up to 30+ days and then we can begin implementing it.

We treat Bitcoin like digital goods. And all goods fall under OFAC regulations. 
Let me quote you a couple of things:
"As part of its enforcement efforts, OFAC publishes a list of individuals and companies owned or controlled by, or acting for or on behalf of, targeted countries. It also lists individuals, groups, and entities, such as terrorists ... designated under programs that are not country-specific. Collectively, such individuals and companies are called "Specially Designated Nationals" or "SDNs." Their assets are blocked and U.S. persons are generally prohibited from dealing with them. [09-10-02]"
"All U.S. persons must comply with OFAC regulations, including all U.S. citizens and permanent resident aliens regardless of where they are located, all persons and entities within the United States, all U.S. incorporated entities and their foreign branches.... [09-10-02]"
