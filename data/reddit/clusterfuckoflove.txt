what could someone legally be doing by moving that much coin at once ?
(thanks for the link)
@_date: 2013-04-02 16:18:40
or guns.. or anything shady. I question BTC's legality in 1 year.
 not because of what its being used for but what people are hearing its being used for.
@_date: 2013-04-02 19:41:12
well they cant outlaw it but the general trend is a cashless society.
@_date: 2013-04-13 05:18:20
when are they likely to be ready? 
can I pay in BTC ?
can it be used for LiteCoins ?
@_date: 2013-04-10 06:38:02
I dont think people will see it as a regular currency for everyday use for a while now. Not here in Australia anyway. But for online purchases of little things I think is were it will really take off.
Maybe to subscribe to a website or buy a set of armour in some MMO. 
At the moment it is being hindered by mystery and confusion. I'm not the smartest person in the world, nor am I the most stupid and I am having trouble working my head around it.
If I am 'umming and erring' then how can I expect my dad to buy BTC to spend online ?
(rhetorical question)

this worries me. its hard for the regular person to access Silk Road, or even know about it, but people dont yet understand BTC and if they hear that it can and is being used for illegal purposes I can image BTC being made illegal too (so no shops will use it).
eg: FOX News headline. **Bitcoins being used to fund terrorists.**
then what happens?
@_date: 2013-04-10 06:43:43
the metric system. I love it. Its all Ive ever known. But still lots of people out there dont use it and dont understand the 'm's.
@_date: 2013-04-10 10:44:47
im a fucking nice person :)
@_date: 2013-04-02 16:44:30
Do you think they wont want to know how much you have, what you are spending it on, and how much they would be getting in tax revenue if it was paid by conventional means.
If you are a US citizen you might want to see what the Patriot Act allows the government to do. 
I'm in Australia, and our sales tax is 10%. If I buy something worth 100$AU with BTC then the government is missing out on $10.
If I get paid $10 to mow someones lawn thats $1 they dont get.
Oh yes, I believe they will want a big say in this and if they dont get their way they will fuck people over.
@_date: 2013-04-05 14:23:45
cool. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 06:31:41
more details please.
When did you first start, with what, did you mine, etc.
 
The more I know the more I can do too. 
I have some money that I need to invest and I have no retirement fund. I'm almost 40 and scared of the future.
@_date: 2013-04-02 15:02:59
thanks.. time to move my post again /bitcoinhelp was empty.
@_date: 2013-04-02 16:08:04
wtf am i getting downvotes? I am asking a legitimate question. I'm not anti BTC, im just asking if BTC can survive if its being talked about in this way.
@_date: 2013-04-05 13:59:26
is there a REDDIT pool happening? 
I'm still new to all of this. Currently using BinMinter. Getting 261.1 by using my video card. 
I have no idea if this is high number.
Just started. No BTC in my account yet.
BitCoin Guild is at 36.6% at the moment. Respectable without being a risk.
@_date: 2013-04-02 16:38:53
yes. depending on the notes in your country you might see 'legal tender'. BTC may end up just like bartering which is non-legal in some countries because it isnt taxed.
how does the governments of the world feel about transactions that cant be taxed ? 
@_date: 2013-12-21 09:34:30
only very slightly over-exaggerated as fuck.
@_date: 2013-04-05 19:34:46
it pays out every 3.5 to 7 hours. 
@_date: 2013-04-05 15:16:34
thanks :)
Yeah I like no fees :D
@_date: 2013-08-12 18:22:25
Good luck with that. 
They cant regulate the banks, how are they going to regulate a virtual currency with no ties to any country which can be traded without anyone knowing about it.
@_date: 2013-05-02 11:36:45
i doubt that. i would hope. what I really think is organized crime moving money.
@_date: 2013-04-02 18:35:13
i think that is an excellent point. Countries such as this would embrace BTC just as they embraced the Euro.
I think its going to come down to a few select countries though and Spain isnt one of them. 
The US, Germany &amp; China are the 3 big ones. China will accept it without doubt. 
The problem lies with the current banks. The ones that were too big to fail. They have lots of $$$ and therefore lots of political power. 
MasterCard, VISA, American Express and countless others are not going to take this lying down. They stand to lose too much. I think I pay 2% per Mastercard transaction.
Now, imagine these banks using their persuasive powers in the US senate. 
The whole BTC screams of a socialist movement. Whether it is or isn't doesn't matter, the words are enough to cause enough havoc and confusion that a bill would quickly be passed making trading in BTC illegal (under the guise of not being patriotic or some shit)..
I hope I'm wrong, I really do. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 06:41:08
I see a coin as a cent. I've always associated the two. The decimal point system also confuses me as they are usually reserved for cents. $0.00 etc.
@_date: 2013-04-17 17:01:48
its operation like this that will make mining not worth the bother for so many people and so the wealth will not be spread out. my opinion anyway.
Whats the point when 1 person can do 65 gigahashes per second ?
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:10:26
currently 90$ US. 
Ouch. not looking good. real shame. I'll keep mining.
wait, its up $5 in the last 5 minutes.. BUY BUY BUY!
back at 90.. SEEEEEEEEEEEEEELLLLL!
@_date: 2013-08-13 01:07:28
if your bank wont, another bank will. Its really not that hard.
@_date: 2013-04-02 16:28:44
yes I read the article, and I think its great news. I love the idea and theme of BTC.
Do I think we can have a currency that the government doesnt control? no. 
I wish i believed otherwise. I really do.
