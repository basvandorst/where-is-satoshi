problem is I have no idea how to add these commands you guys write... i just see the icon for bitcoin and i click it.. i dont see a command prompt.. 
@_date: 2015-12-02 23:54:07
well, it's been 11 hours so far :D ... but hopefully when I get up in the morning it will be there..   so you don't still think that it didn't go through and broadcasted?  or do you think it did and I should just wait?
@_date: 2015-12-02 23:27:40
But how come I see the transaction on the blockchain.info site?
@_date: 2015-12-02 23:32:40
this is the address that i sent it to... 
if you put it in block chain.. it shows up
@_date: 2015-12-02 21:20:24
you mean the transaction ID?  It's in the bitcoin wallet .. how can that be helpful?
@_date: 2015-12-03 07:02:08
wow man that would be awesome!  would be handy to have it any way... how are you so knowledgeable about this stuff? are you a programmer?
@_date: 2015-12-02 22:44:44
haha being a total noob I have no idea what getting mined means... just was concerned that the funds would get lost or something... I was reading in some forums that I should resend with a higher transaction fee... is that possible?  I can't seem to find the option for it in Bitcoin... and as soon as I see it confirmed I will let you know!  thanks a ton for your help bud!

when you say run bit coin with this .. you mean i should type in the run box of windows:  bitcoin -zapwallettxes=1 -rescan?
@_date: 2015-12-02 23:00:06
thanks man!  I'll wait for your answer
@_date: 2015-12-05 21:30:42
to anyone having the same problem... after about 2 and a half days the confirmation came.. if you used bitcoin core...  the best thing to do is just wait it out...  thanks to everyone for their help!
@_date: 2015-12-02 23:48:03
Ah.. ya I saw that also on blockchain.info.. i was wondering what that was... I'm so confused! lol

no I have no clue what that is... I'm also trying to find out how to set the default fee in bitcoin core to 0.0001 but I don't see the option for it.. 
@_date: 2015-12-02 22:31:54
ah... I just checked and yes.. it's very low... 
its Transaction fee: -0.00000416 BTC
how long would you guess it will take to be confirmed?
also, do you have any idea why such a low transaction id was charged?
@_date: 2015-12-02 22:30:29
where should I put the transaction id?  when i put it  in the main search it says Unrecognized search pattern
@_date: 2015-12-02 23:55:46
got it! thanks a lot bud!  will be in touch if it doesn't get through... 
@_date: 2015-12-02 20:55:03
It's been 7 hours now since I made the payment.   It was the standard 0.000001 btc that the bitcoin wallet asked...    is this normal for it to not even go through 1 node?   right before I made this payment, I had transferred the btc from my localbitcoin wallet to my bitcoin core QT wallet.. that earlier transaction already has 42 confirmations... this one has Zero.
@_date: 2015-12-02 23:44:06
thank you a lot for your help.. but I really have no idea how to do the zapwallettxes and rescan...   is there any chance you could explain that to me, or refer me to a link where its explained how to do this with bitcoin core?
@_date: 2015-12-02 23:21:51
got it! Is there anyway to add this transaction fee to the payment that is already sent? or is my only option to just wait?
@_date: 2015-12-03 20:50:55
thanks a lot man! &lt;3!  how long would you estimate that will take?
Also, how did you search for the transaction ID if I may ask?  Whenever I put the transaction Id into the search box it says pattern not recognized..
