Not taking $200k a quarter for Tibanne (of which Mark is the sole employee) will probably help burned investors as well...

Agree, but this only holds water IF emerging markets want to buy and actually couldn't at all in any other way. Im super bullish on BTC and have been for a couple of years don't mistake me for being someone trying to talk the price down. Just bringing a little balance to the constant circle jerk ;) 
@_date: 2014-11-23 16:13:46
It is indeed. 
@_date: 2014-07-02 13:10:30
Correct me if Im wrong but someone bought them with the intention to provide liquidity in emerging markets i.e sell them and this is good news ? 
Surely a private investor is the best possible outcome, one who isn't looking to sell. Like I say correct me if I'm wrong but this is basically saying they are going to be sold, 30k BTC previously out of circulation is about to re-enter...
@_date: 2014-03-18 12:04:55
Thats the most retarded thing I've ever seen. If you held BTC and wanted to buy LTC you would trade your BTC for LTC not sell BTC for fiat and then buy LTC.

lol, Jorge Stolfi will not be accepting your change tip, of that I can guarantee :) Just check out his anti Bitcoin ramblings on bitcointalk to see for yourself!

You can buy Tesla and other company shares as well as trade FX and commodities on 1broker.

And this my friends is exactly whats wrong with the current community. Even people who claim to believe in bitcoin only really care about the fiat value. 
"nothing is more exciting than making fast money"
Bitcoins gone from a fantastic anarchic project to a bunch of people trying to get rich quick. 
"I should have sold above $1000" so some other poor sod can hold your bag. S'alright though as long as you got rich for doing nothing eh.
@_date: 2015-01-30 19:08:10
Yawn, I'm allowed my opinion on whats wrong with the current community. Especially as someone who has been around Bitcoin longer than OP and have seen how it used to be. Intelligent people with intelligent thoughts instead of the constant circle jerk and shouting of moon. Real interests in developments and how to further the project and not a bunch of gambling addicts getting kicks from the price going up and wishing in hindsight to have passed the bag. Which the OP openly admits they are guilty of.

Wow, nice comment. How about you get back to school and learn how to use grammar.
@_date: 2017-10-06 11:03:24
Oh I dunno, hmmmm.
Maybe all the users and what they want. Businesses, which is all the economy and mining hasrate is, IS NOT Bitcoin!
@_date: 2015-03-21 14:39:07
For 10 minutes and they said it was just due to the mail server being down. I was able to withdraw immediately when I heard the news, no issues. Plus even if they did halt withdrawals for 10 minutes I think a company is allowed 10 minutes to think about protecting their private business and business interests when they get reports of people receiving PM's being asked to be mules for known stolen goods. 
@_date: 2015-03-25 23:57:19
Double spend and change wallets.
@_date: 2015-03-21 16:09:59
Did I say anything about them not being temporarily down, the beginning of my comment says "for 10 minutes" so why were you telling me they were temporarily down for. They were working again when I wrote this comment while this subreddit was freaking out. The added bit wasn't aimed at you, it's my opinion for anyone who might of been reading this.
@_date: 2015-03-21 02:55:15
Withdrawals are working btw. Nice bit of FUD though...
@_date: 2015-02-02 12:16:33
Much appreciated 
@_date: 2015-02-01 00:45:34
Because the amount of coins mined per day will half to approx 1800. Basically reducing daily inflation by a significant factor. Less coins mined = less coins to dump on the market. Miners also will receive half the reward for their costs. Its not quiet this simple but theoretically miners will have to either switch off or get more usd for their coins to cover their costs.
@_date: 2013-11-19 15:47:17
Same but its still gone up about $200 since I sent my payment out. Luckily I'm trying to buy more coins and have a decent stash I'd be livid if I had sold on localbitcoins or spent my btc on something and was trying to replenish at market rate at the time. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 15:06:51
It still doesn't require a central issuing organization. Nobody is issuing bitcoin.
Business WILL NOT accept bitcoin just because it helps their bottom line. Businesses have bills and outgoings too. They have shareholders to please and do not want to be getting caught in legal matters. Hence SOME regulation. I mean what are they going to with a ton of bitcoin and no way to pay the bills? Convert it to fiat obviously and thats what we dont want. It creates volatility and still carries with it all the pitfalls we are going against.
How do you propose the bitcoin community set up the system itself when the system is already established. Bitcoin is trying to join the system but without the downfalls of fiat. 
I agree that it would be great if there was no regulation and there was a free market but unfortunately the rest of the world doesnt work like that. Business and people need guarantees and insurance. A business knows that if someone was to hack their accounts they would get any stolen money back. What are they going to do if someone gets their private key? Again obviously there should never be any chance of that and wallets should be encrypted and offline but that will not be the case. Bitcoin is still very hard to use and you do have to be technically minded. 
You seem to have this idea of an anarchist currency that's allowed to circumvent all other laws which bitcoin could be BUT you will not get mainstream adoption and big business investment pushing it forward in that case will you?
@_date: 2013-11-20 11:04:31
Is this the standard of people who we have in the bitcoin community? Screaming, crying and panicking because an extremely new idea isn't perfect and has growing problems? 
@_date: 2013-11-19 15:53:22
Same for everybody. How such a huge exchange that at the moment can literally print money cant support an infrastructure to deal with the traffic is beyond me
@_date: 2013-11-20 14:18:20
I think you've just gotten really lucky then to be honest. I've spoke with several people myself included who have been waiting about a week. Lucky you :)
@_date: 2013-11-19 15:38:28
I'd sell a bit and buy myself something nice but if your financially secure without your btc investment just buckle up and enjoy a once in a lifetime ride! 
@_date: 2013-11-20 16:44:31
Bitstamp has been having some serious issues with DDOS and their banking software. Some people have been waiting for a few days btc transfers and about a week for wire transfers. Theyve literally just got back up properly and credited all deposits etc. I imagine the guy will have his BTC now
@_date: 2013-11-20 11:01:11
My personal opinion is that as soon as people deposits show up in their bitstamp accoutn (some people have been waiting a week) then they will be rushing to buy. I beleive this mainly because people who are waiting on those deposits generally sent them when the price was in the low $400 and have been tearing their hair out trying to get in all the time watching the price rise and rise. Many of those same people will jump at the chance of these cheaper coins.

You should check out frozencoin. Its a quark fork but with a much better mining distrubution model. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 17:29:23
Great so I'm excersising my right to freedom of speech. Nobody wants to hear your whining over and over again. I asked you a question about what your trying to achieve. You seem to think you lost money but how can that be the case. 
I actually replied to one of your other threads and told you WHY this happened.
Furthermore the rediquette does not encourage duplicate posting and flooding the new feed section.
@_date: 2013-11-20 12:52:47
When was this though? I've deposited before and had it on the same day. However they are having some serious problems atm and I've had a deposit in limbo for a week. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 12:23:31
For a one time quick and easy purchase localbitcoins as mentioned or bitbargain.co.uk are your best bets.
@_date: 2013-11-20 17:23:44
Mate, you really need to stop posting the same thing over and over again. What are you trying to achieve?
@_date: 2013-11-21 14:13:13
Why do people keep touting that bitcoin as anonymous! 
It never has been. 
In regards to regulation not all regulations bad. I think the majority of us here are hoping that in the future BTC will be worth more and be exchangeable for many goods and services. This will not happen without at least some sort of regulation. Big business are not going to accept your internet money without certain guarantees and regulation in place.
What the community is against is things like coin taint which damage the fungibility of bitcoin. 
Do you really think that we will achieve 100's of billion market cap without big investors and big business? 
And do you think that they will jump into bitcoin without at least some guarantees and guidelines?
@_date: 2013-11-20 17:38:44
Here you go then I'll help you out been as your obviously so asinine you can't even read comments in topics you have created. 
The top comment in there is from me. 
You haven't lost anything stop moaning.
End of story. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 15:49:40
The simple fact is though business won't provide it if they can't do so with set guidelines and in a way that won't put them on the wrong side of the law. Small business yes, but anybody who makes serious money, no. Also I think you over estimate the demand for bitcoin accepting businesses at the moment. The vast majority still haven't even heard of bitcoin and as soon as they say can I pay my bills in it or get my shopping they really don't care. 
Don't get me wrong I do generally agree with you but trying to act like an underground anarchist currency isn't going to get us very far in the civilized world. 
The difference is with bitcoin though is the fundamentals never change. Its deflationary, decentralized etc and with just standard regulations and guidelines it can be what it was supposed to be. Anybody campaigning for no regulation at all and for business to just do it anyway is a long way off the mark.

This is a post from hazek bitstamps owner on bitcointalk forum. Nothing to worry about 
The fee has been reset and is now being recalculated which takes 2 seconds per every user(after maintenance server has to re-calculate the last 30days of trading for every user).
While the fee may not be correctly displayed the correct fee is applied when trading. This can be confirmed in your transaction's log.
@_date: 2013-11-19 14:48:14
I too have money in limbo to bitstamp a look at their facebook page points to banking software issues. 
I'm sure you are as annoyed as me about the massive price rise since the SEPA payment was sent. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 13:49:53
Really like the new additions. The animation of the coins moving stutters quite badly though.
@_date: 2013-11-20 11:42:38
Exactly. The vast majority who complain would do exactly the same thing if they were in the positions of power. I just wish I had alot more fiat to take some coins off these people who think that they were going to be millionaires over night. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 14:58:44
I agree the 29 hour wait time I have on my support ticket is testament to their poor support infrastructure. Everyone understand being busy and abit of patience and leeway is needed but they need to recognise they are a large business handling serious amounts of peoples money. Imagine if you couldn't get in touch with your bank for this long!
