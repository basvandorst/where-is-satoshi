I went to steps 1-4, but currently cycling through  again back and on step 2. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 19:01:30
I understand the value of BTC, but at the same time, why not have some other alts work for you to earn more BTC? That’s where I’m at now. Working out fine so far...especially after the big dip a few days ago. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:22:39
Same. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 01:57:32
I’ve had the opposite...people asking if they should but now. I said yes. 
But that’s mostly because I told a few people they should but into when it dips hard. That was when it was at 16,000+ the other week. I feel confident in recommending them to buy now around 10,000. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 06:24:55
I got excited for about a half second 
@_date: 2018-01-12 02:32:12
The chicken standard? 
@_date: 2017-12-12 13:32:50
Let’s see another 30% gain! 
Dilly Dilly!

Why is there such a big price difference between Blockchain wallet and Coinbase price? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:21:52
Hoping to see sub-13 so I can buy again. Otherwise I’m staying with what I got. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:48:50
Or hundreds
Or millions 
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:29:11
Thanks. I know Coinbase is backed up right now, but I didn’t realize GDAX to wallet would be a wait. I was under the impression that was instant. I was wrong. It’s in progress now. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:36:28
Wasn’t that only like 2 minutes? 
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:45:37
*holds pinky to mouth*
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:39:39
You are 100% correct....but I can still have a little regret buying at 16,900 yesterday though. Haha! 
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:43:17
I wish I started from the bottom. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:23:01
Yes. Domestic adoption can run anywhere from $10,000-$40,000 USD. It’s outrageous. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:57:32
As long as that same bat is used for me when it was 5,000 a month ago. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 02:47:05
I’ve had a few conversations lately with very intelligent people who were unaware of this. I informed them of this fact and recommended some easy ways of buying into it. 
Funny story...I was one of those people a few months ago. I actually heard Glenn Beck mention it on his radio show (who knew right!?). He recommended buying in a $100 or so. So I did. Now I’m glad.
@_date: 2017-12-19 02:48:17
Hodling at whole new level 
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:44:16
Currently LTC at $137. Shoot me. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 14:25:59
The more I see involvement of Wall Street and other financial institutions, the more I see BTC going up. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:55:59
Haha I thought the same. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:21:54
But but...ok ok you’re right 
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:22:58
I think that’s a decent amount. Just be careful. I did the same, and within three weeks I did it again, and again...and again. I’m done. I promise. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:09:43

50k by Jan 31 is a bit optimistic. But we can al hope, right!?!? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:20:43
This really isn’t for the faint of heart. I sold 100% of my litecoin yesterday to put it in BTC. Of course litecoin hits all time high this morning. 
Honestly though, I’m still good with it. I like bitcoin long term growth better. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:26:25
You’ll be alright. It will be back to 18-19 within days. 
Source: wild guess and gut feeling :)
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:58:17
When it started to rise in value...and then it kept rising, and now people foresee it to rise more. It’s hard not to focus on that honestly. It’s money, not my family. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:09:05
Bought at 65. Sold at 100. 
*sad face*
Considering buying at 180. 
Edit: it’s at 227 now. I’m diving in. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:35:56
Good point, but still...no one knows. It may be back to $1000 next week. Doubtful, but it could happen. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:45:04
I’m freaking out with major FOMO over here. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:51:39
Donald? That you? 
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:35:29
lol sorry buddy. I feel the pain. LTC currently at $160. 
Slow and steady wins the race I guess. Next time I won’t panic buy or sell. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:35:48
A couple thoughts:
1. If it all goes to crap after futures, no worries. You’re not out your life savings.
2. If it goes to 20k+ you’ll be tempted to put in another 250-500. Be safe. Don’t get crazy. Do only what you can afford to lose overnight. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 14:31:47
I’m a complete rookie noob...but how would futures be bad? It seems as it would only bring more legitimacy and action around BTC. What’s the other side of thought on that? Why would it be negative? 
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:48:38
What about CFA? I love their chicken 
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:21:16
Isn’t GDAX Coinbase as well? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:47:17
Yep. I’m learning that. Only been doing the crypto world for about 6 weeks now. It’s nutty...but a little fun. Well, at least the last 6 weeks have been haha. Ask me in a year. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:46:27
Probably because it will...and then will sink back to slightly higher than what it was a week ago and people will call it a dip. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:49:40
Since BTC is down today, is it bad timing to purchase other crypto on exchanges using BTC? I’m new to this. Most other crypto is also down today, so that’s why I ask. Tanks for the help.
@_date: 2017-12-24 06:58:51
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:25:29
I could, but I went LTC for my other buy. It seems LTC, BTC, and Ethereum were all good buys today 
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:57:56
Ok I’m buying the dip. Got in at 11,700. 
It could all go away I guess, but I see it hopping back up quickly 
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:55:01
I was trying to sell some litecoin today on Coinbase so I could transfer it to btc. I kept getting error messages one after the next. Eventually I sold but only after price went down a couple dollars more from the first time I tried. Frustrating. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:47:04
Congrats on retirement savings. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:26:27
Hopefully IOTA and Monero 
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:07:19
I take it you bought at 18,500? Ha! 
@_date: 2017-12-09 14:34:37
This is ridiculous out here!!! It’s only up 44% this week! WHATS THE WORLD COMING TO????!!!?!

Unfortunately it’s not quite as easy as getting a plane ticket to the UK and taking a child home.

Beanie babies are a worthy investment. I’m still stocking up. Aren’t you? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:04:32
Off the rails? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:00:23
Maybe? But it could go to 25,000 next week. Who knows. 
There are also predictions of 100k in 2018. No one knows. 
@_date: 2018-03-02 15:05:55
Yeah my first thought was the spouses friends...who then go on to tell others. It multiplies. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 02:21:48
No I don’t. That would be stupid.

Lies...credit cards are getting declined left and right for crypto. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 04:47:00
Extremely accurate except for the other atls not falling as well haha
@_date: 2018-02-20 02:58:00
I’m skeptical of how this is more beneficial than just buying bitcoin yourself for however and whenever you want to. Plus, where do you buy your groceries? 
@_date: 2018-04-06 15:19:19
That’s awesome. I love me some duolingo
