Until people use bitcoin as money as it was designed, and not to earn dollars, which it is meant to replace, it will stagnate.
Dont try to twist bitcoin into a settlement layer either, it's purpose is stateless currency issued by an algorithm, which no government has power to issue, period end of story.

Sorry that disappoints you, we still have not fully worked out our tiered AML and KYC policy yet, but Fingerprints are only used to tie to the SMS number used, and any other data collected. If you would like, you can venture to our site, and see MY (CEO) personal Fingerprint Data on the website, if I wasn't completely comfortable in our  Encrypted Data, I would not do that. 
You must remember the USA requires us to comply with all Anti Money Laundering and Know Your Customer laws as your local Bank Branch, we are just doing it with a machine, and software, and in a minute or two you get bitcoin, simple as that. If you want to sell us coin, no confirms for anything under $100, anything more than that and it's one confirm, and you get cash. 
We also only require SMS and Fingerprint up to $1000, so if you can get that from Coinbase, or any other instant provider without providing your ID, Tickle me scared they will be shutdown pretty quick. 
We are trying to fight for less and less AML and KYC, please don't hate on Fingerprints, or Photo's of your ID on site for transactions over $1000, it's to appease the great Overlords the Fed. 
We are trying to make it SAFE and 10x easier to get large-ER amounts of coin bought or sold for cash, than dealing with local-bitcoins and possible scams. Bear with us as we try to spread bitcoin physically, in a cross of something they already understand, ATM's.

No, not like that you don't. The value in buying a robocoin as an operator is zero.  I fought my state for approval to NOT be a money transmitter, because I'm not. These are two party transactions, and photographs of customers taken, along with sms and fingerprint. Identification cards ala: Nazi Statism only required for transactions of massive amounts, or volume totals cumulatively. 
Robocoin is creating what's called regulatory capture, and any true bitcoin enthusiast knows, this is a negative impact.

I operate a BTM that is registered with FINcen, But I am not state licensed as a money transmitter, and I have APPROVAL to operate without such licensing, as we are an UNBANKED BTM, all our models will remain unbanked, all coins bought by us are held, and then re-sold. 
We adjust the spread to favor one over the other if we need, IE, we need more bitcoin, we buy it closer to market price, if we have to much coin, we sell it for closer to market price. 
This is the only way to do it and argue you DO NOT transmit money, and are simply an exchanger at a state level, if the state is not NY. 
@_date: 2014-08-12 07:37:45
Cash a Check? 
I certainly have put my thumbprint on quite a few. 
Also its either that, or I can't have transactions over $100, because I have to make CERTAIN that no one else can come up and use the machine as YOU once your Identity has Been Verified, there is NO human to Check your ID, and I certainly don't want people to have to show it every single time to the camera, once is more than enough for ID verification, Fingerprint to PROVE to the machine it is you after for subsequent transactions. If its not your Bag, sorry, but in the future, NO one is going to be able to sell Bitcoin without these policies in place, well they could, but not if they want to keep a REAL bank account as well.
It is as much for us as it is for the customer, if someone buys bitcoin under your presumed ID, and then funds terrorism, or looks up and pays for kiddie porn, you are in serious shit. 
This makes ABSOLUTELY certain, that someone cannot buy bitcoin, under YOUR identity, in the physical world, by either forging your ID, stealing it and your phone, or a multitude of other ways Identity Theft Happens. This ultimately makes absolutely certain, without physically HARMING someone, or under GREAT duress, that you cannot steal and tarnish their identity. 
Also here is a FULL SNAPSHOT of MY Encrypted Fingerprint Data, if you can decrypt that....well....your worth more than bitcoin is alone. 
@_date: 2014-11-01 00:50:52
See the reason we don't cash out bitcoin for any percentage on Coinbase or any other exchange, is simply this. 
WE ARE NOT A MONEY TRANSMITTER. 
We buy and sell coin, and act as a liquidity sponge, if you would like to bow down to almighty regulators, and this is all dependent if your bitcoin business can even get a bank account (trust me you won't here in the USA), defeats the decentralized model of running them this way. 
The cool thing is there is nothing stopping you from buying your own machine, and getting your own opinion from the state based on your operations, that your expensive lawyer attains for you. 
We run our machines the way we see fit to operate them, without being a part of a broken financial system, we hold our profit in bitcoin, we do not profit in Fiat as some would like to, as I suspect that is all you would be interested in. We are one of the few smaller privately held, and personally funded, decentralized bitcoin ATM operators in the USA. 
What do you do again besides come on reddit and shit on me after snarkily offering to buy my machine from me because you think you can somehow do better? 
Let me clue you in, if you think you can do better, then by all means go and do it, but the fact that a competing Robocoin can't even get placement, and lost their Co-Founder in  it does not look good for anyone who isn't in this for the reason of furthering the cause of BITCOIN, not your fucking fiat's bank account balance. 
Also let me clue you in to location fees, taxes, accounting, hosting, running full node wallets in the cloud, my time, my brother's time, and the multitude of other factors, and then let's talk brass tax. This does not even include legal and compliance costs, which could range you anywhere from $10k to $100k USD. You are obviously just mad, but you can certainly just go and buy your own machine, and then 6 months from now, when it is still collecting dust like the majority percentage of other USA purchaser's of these units because they cannot, and will not get approval to operate how you are thinking, you can call me up and I will buy it from you for half price.  
Also if you are tense from this experience, you DEFINITELY need to reconsider buying a bitcoin ATM. 
This is fucking Fisher-Price on the fun scale in this world.
@_date: 2014-06-20 06:00:16
I will counter on ONE point, I am about to launch a machine, I will have more liquidity and be using a HOT WALLET meaning, you are not SITTING around and waiting for your coin, if you want more than $1000 of coin, you have to link bank accounts, wire money, or use coinbase, and then on top of that wait days for them to deliver the coin. At MY ATM you will be able to purchase up to $3000 in CASH with an SMS verification and Fingerprint Scan, sorry its in the USA and states Require AML and KYC, it is a reality of the United States. 
Also, Buying coin in bulk, I do NOT get it for full bitstamp price, I buy from second market and there is a premium to not move the market, so the fact you do not know these things, means you have much to learn about a financial market and financial services of ANY kind, bitcoin included. Bringing it into the mainstream costs significant time, money, and capital. I would love to see you plunk down $200k USD to operate them in multiple states.
Also my prices will be SET not floating, I have a set profit margin and that is it, in 5 states, so if the prices flies past mine, It will remain at its lower profit margin set price....I would love to see anyone else do anything like it.

Bitstamp price isn't "the" price... You realize bitstamp has about a $50-60 spread on any given day from low to high, yes? Now what you have to realize is because how fast bitcoin does move in relation to Fiat, you must have what's called operational margins, those margins are going to be larger than any exchange they are being pulled from, otherwise the companies providing bitcoin, will be out of business faster than they can get in business. 
Right now we are still in bitcoins infancy, but to build bitcoin over the top of an ACH or magnetic stripe type system is pretty backwards to the protocol and what it was created for.

As they should if they want to hold private keys for customers, multi-signature or not, you are a fucking bank then. You have to have transparent audits and the whole 9 yards, and prove you aren't running a deflationary, multi-faceted asset class/currency as a fractional reserve like a bone head.
Same goes for coinbase, xapo, Circle, they all use or imply the bank technicals of yesterday when it's absurdly dangerous to do as such.

A few from Mensa, some from Mathematics and other competitions I have won over the years.....you are seriously lacking business acumen....Look at Coinbase's Spread, and come back to me with a 1% figure, because it is more than 1% on EVERY transaction, Bank Processing has a minimum 0.15 Cent Charge on $1 BTC buys. Right now a buy of 0.00175 BTC is $1.04 with a 0.1 Cent Coinbase fee, and a 0.15 Cent Bank Fee. So it is $1.20 for $1.04 in BTC....that is a bit more than 1%....and if you dont see a bank fee....you are inherently LYING, every single fucking bank will charge this fee....if you dont see it, coinbase HIDES that fee and bakes it in, since THERE BANK will charge them for it.

Ya, again I am going to rant here. 
These fucking regulators think they are just king of Rome and all its subdivisions. They want your cake, and my cake, and then they want to make sure it's expensive as fuck to make that cake with regulation in other horseshit made up regulatory capture agencies. 
Excuse me good sirs. Last I checked I was born on sovereign USA soil. The reason your pompous, self serving selves have a right to sit in those $6000 executive ergonomic suck your balls off chairs is us. Now that I'm old enough to create a business, you wanna suck it dry? So much for backbone of America right? 
But guess what? 
The free lunch at barrel length of a gun is over, we have social media, encrypted messaging, and all sorts of fun little apps and gadgets that mean you have zero power over individual self. Not the least of which is counterparty, or ethereum, or blocknet potentially. 
True. Freedom.
To crowd-fund or create microeconomies or state level crypto currencies, collegiate level and student loans could be provided by POS sidechain coins by a schools alma-mater, the possibilities are endless in a free crypto society, free of artificial currency devaluation through hyperinflation, being just one of a multitude of problems with our current economic framework. 
I only hope people listen to tiny fish like me, yelling at them to not follow the school into the trawling net, but into the open ocean that is freedom and security.

1. So what 
2. It is still FUD 
3. Have fun with that exchange and "more favorable rate" And getting your money out of banks, the point of bitcoin is to remove them from the equation. 
4. No they won't and honestly the numbers speak for themselves. And yes it is still cheaper at an ATM location, because the savings in bitcoin is not in the acquisition OF or purchase of said bitcoin, it is in the network transaction fees, of which there is no visa hammering 3% on merchants, and no western union taking 13% on international money transfers. 
There is still MASSIVE savings buying bitcoin from an atm with a 7% transaction fee, for the purpose of sending STORED VALUE over an OCEAN. Completely missing the point in USING and furthering the network adoption, it is about REMOVING shysters from the equation. 
Once your local mom and pops start accepting bitcoin through a merchant service such as Coinbase.com and they see that there are no 3% transaction fees, of which eat into a good deal of local and small businesses bottom line, they will see the light, and so will you. An atm operator charging even 7% is still a NET savings overall for the purpose of transacting STORED VALUE.

I cannot emphasize this enough. 
You do not get it yet, Mr Santori, Mr. Goldman Lawsky, you are irrelevant here, your futile attempt to subvert bitcoin for incumbent control (yes I mean your best buddies the Bankers, and Mastercard) , will be counteracted at the protocol level at every turn. The protocol does not need you. It's a better solution than anything you have ever offered, fact. 
The code maintainers are creating at the protocol level, transaction address decoupling, to make ALL REGULATORY AML OR KYC THE LARGEST WASTE OF HUMAN RESORUCES AND MONEY TO EVER BE SPENT.
Businesses that hold customer funds, whether the customer holds keys or not, should be insured, example? BLOCKCHAIN.info and their RNG fiasco. 
But I digress. Business selling bitcoin live on and off exchanges include a 3rd party, they should absolutely be regulated as well. 
But for instance my company which sells and buys bitcoin in the most decentralized way possible....by gasp profiting in bitcoin as well as not selling or buying off exchanges, and appropriating liquidity and spreads to even out what's needed at any time. Example: I have 8 btc but need more cash then I have to replace coin sold, I used to have ten, so what do I do? I increase the spread on "we sell"side premiums temporarily and decrease the" we buy" spread, and entice more people to sell us bitcoin. 
I do not need costly insurance or bonds, bitcoin is our bond. It's more secure and guaranteed than anything you can offer. We don't hold customer funds, you give us cash, or coin, you get INSTANT cash, zero wait or confirmation lag, we give cash on zero confirmations because WE CAN trust the bitcoin network more than any settlement system EVER before. 
Regulating bitcoin is like putting a 3 foot gate in an open field with no fence. Let that sink in.

With the Bitkee cards you ABSOLUTELY know if your package was tampered with after leaving their facility upon reaching you, the services are not even comparable to me.

This is exactly what it is, except volume and other numbers can actually be attributed to one "identity". I don't know your name, because that is just silly stupid, and I argued that centralizing this information, much like credit and other data, is moot for cash two-party transactions, between one entity, and a sovereign citizen in the USA.  It just leaves the door open to more Targets and Home Depot Hacks like the past, instead of the future of security it can provide. 
If they are on USA soil and they are a "terrorist" well, that means that Hundreds of Billions of Fiat Dollars, and years of oppressive privacy laws, failed. Is it really so hard for people to logically deduce this? These are not our problems. 
Also, this just means law enforcement must use the very same tools, to forensically link an identity, with the information I have gathered, they just must actually do some real Investigative work, and my gosh, know for certain who is actually partaking in so called "criminal activities", not just be able to point at a person buying a few hundred dollars in bitcoin per month, and automatically have the ability to suspect criminal actions. This is assuming guilt over innocence, and is constitutionally backwards. 
The onus of proof is NOT on me as a business, or my customers, its on the Government to prove or disprove you as a criminal! And rightfully so I believe. People like Jordan Kelly would befriend the Nazi's if it made him wealthy, and "safe", this is despicable and I for one hope most people avoid their company like the fucking plague it is.
We are citizens of the United States of America, and Two parties absolutely do not need to log and register every transaction with Identification Cards like the Nazi's did, just because a Government Agency says so. This is absurd, and the fact we let it get that far in the hands of the Jordan Kelly's and the Fred Ehrsam's of Bitcoin is disgusting, and wrong.

Really....Its called a dusty environment, and its a 2 year old keyboard, 
My Keyboard came without ANY fucking issues and it was just as expensive as this teeeeny tiny device, which has about $25 in parts, There is no way this cost anymore than that in ACTUAL parts, injection molding and all. 
What I am bothered by, is the actual build quality, the quality assurance and inspection before these go out the proverbial door, and what happens after the fact. All those things matter in a "consumer" mass adoption bitcoin wallet. 
My keyboard on the other hand probably cost about Twice that.

I have spent a bit more than that, I will be launching a Genesis Coin Machine in Portland, Oregon in a week-ish, with several other states that I have the rights to operate these machines exclusively.

I understand hardware is SIGNIFICANTLY different than hardware....
But for the cost, it needs to have a bit better build quality, just spudging it lightly with a plastic tool MEANT for prying plastic has marred the clean injection molding edges. All to remove a plastic film left entirely seated underneath the housing??? That seems not right to me. 
If you think the Generation that goes and whines about slightly mis-aligned Chamfering on iphone's are going to tolerate ANYTHING like this, in fit, finish and quality, bitcoin is going to be niche forever.

Probably not to all of it, who is liable for compliance, who is liable for cash, who is liable for the bitcoin hot wallet and replenishment? Without guarantees it is liquid and stocked at all times it is worthless to an airport. 
Most the airports want a cut of transactions anywhere from 25-50% of all fees, on top of a monthly rent fee. I would love to entertain setting up an international corporation to do this, but I would want the same exorbitant salary equivalent financial sector jobs get paid, which is close to the $200k a year mark. 
To be honest just look at Planet Capital, companies like them will have them out in airports very soon, but if you think they will have no fees, or even less than currently exist, you are mistaken. There will always be fees. Nobody does anything for free.

Ubi will work, trials across the world right now, what it doesn't have in place though are the automated factories that will pay 80% tax on earnings, why so high you ask? If automation increases production 300-500% (it does) and revenue goes up 200%, they can pay 80% in taxes on a machines output, how? Because each machine adds twice the value ad its cost comparative to humans. It's simple. 
Bitcoin will be MORE than $100k, best estimate is $500,000 USD by 2040, why? Because game theory, that's why, one country holds as reserve, sets off a chain of events unprecedented in the battle for sound money reserves.

Why would I charge close to what it costs anyone wiring even a minimal amount of money to bitstamp to get coins would be charged. 
I am in business to make money, and I have done well at that. I think the only business I miss out on is because I don't have hundreds of thousands to float, and sometimes, demand outstrips supply of BOTH bitcoin or cash. 
My only problems are "good" problems, am I leaving money on the table? You bet your ass I am. But I just don't have it in me to go sell hard assets like real estate and other things that are truly valuable, to service a community that bitches about me making money to do it. 
The reality is. The only people fucking crying like babies are the people with thousands of dollars in coins, who bought high and are pissed they didn't invest in businesses that make a mint. And they want to undercut it. 
Get bent people, you want a decentralized economy, go spend $30,000 and 6 months of your own time creating a brand and legal entity, and everything else that isn't discussed when starting a business. And do it at a loss. I swear everyone here is like a High School dropout, or our education system was really that bad in the mid 2000's because everyone here is spouting off business management ideas like they have a clue, when they could not manage a fucking wendy's. Start a financial services company, get back to me, then let's talk about fee's. 
If you can do it better. Do it. If not your just a crybaby. Just for arguement sake, I have one single competitor being a robocoin in a mall. He pays 15x what I do or more in rent, close to $3800 a month, and charges 5%. He worked in the banking industry and somehow he managed to lose fucking money doing this. 
Me on the other hand, I have never worked in a bank, hate financial services, and still managed to pull out profits.
Who is doing it right and who is doing it wrong? He has too little volume, and I have too much. What a conundrum right! 
@_date: 2015-01-25 23:22:15
No, the fact is they could have employed them to make all the regulatory bullshit go away, I know one large holder in particular that could have ended it all with his holdings, and still sit on 10k plus. But no, he is waiting for people like me to build out the value in the bitcoin ecosystem so he can cash out on people just getting into it. 
Get real, read between the simpleton lines, and understand what I am saying, Large holders, won't even invest in the bitcoin ecosystem, so then why will anyone? 
Again to reiterate my point, people with IQ's the size of a potato should not become wealthy from doing nothing, that is going to create more problems than it solves in society. 
For instance if I had 15,000 coins, I could have ended homelessness in one US state, no problem, and had 10,000 coins to spare. Anyone not doing good or something WITH those coins, is a royal piece of shit.

I could introduce you to ten personally, several of which had never even made transactions with their massive holdings too, you have zero fucking clue. There are folks out there with !0,000 coins, who DONT EVEN KNOW HOW TO USE THE DAMN SHIT. Period. They have to be hand held through a transaction, while you stare at 10,000 coins in a blockchain.info wallet. 
If you only really knew the sheer level of potato that thinking coin will reach that, for folks sitting on 10,000 coins for a decade at that point, doing nothing with them, you are mistaken. Coin will never go over $1000 with that kind of untold wealth potential in the hands of what amounts to toddlers.

It would have been cheaper and easier to fly to Hong Kong, reinvent my entire existence, and setup shop there than to appease and go with this bullshit "regulation" we are being dealt.

That is because of financial regulation required by the Federal Government in the United States of America. Its also because bitcoin is a more powerful form of value, their are no Chargebacks, so if you use credit or debit, they must verify the funds are coming from the person who says they are purchasing the coins. 
@_date: 2015-01-25 12:36:50
Not to be the Debbie downer, but I have to. Until large holders with 10,000+ coin they are just sitting on, invest in the ecosystem, the pipe dream of that is just never gonna happen. 
First hand met people who could have ended any regulation talk, by just buying off politicians with jobs that paid 7 figures. Nope. Sitting on it doing nothing. This is the downfall of the ecosystem right now, too many under educated folk got lucky, and expect their luck to be built for them. 
Until investments are made with coin. Merchants converting will always outpace the adoption, same with mining pressure until the halvening at the least. 
Moral of story, if you have 50,000 coins and are dreaming to be Elon Musk wealthy, all while playing video games and banging hookers the whole way up, dream on dudes.
Now if you want to invest 3000 coins....to make. Millions in fiat, all while making your remaining Bitcoin holdings worth the $10,000 you dream of. That is defintely a plausible scenario,  but flying around the world buying five star shit with it, while expecting fiat/time/lives to be pumped in to build an ecosystem for it, well that isn't gonna happen guys, the legacy encumbents will win with lobbying power to the tune of  hundreds of millions, and the right people being paid off. 
Say merchant adoption one more time. What matters is the greedy one cent cost average holders who want to make the Forbes list off the backs of those who are building this with real work and fiat, well....Its kind of sick. Heres reality if you made 1000 coins in any capacity ever, and don't run a Bitcoin business furthering the ecosystem, you are the problem. And will never see the purchase power of Bitcoin you dream of.
I know first hand several 10,000 plus straight holders that don't do jack shit with them, except wait for moon.
You all have to realize there are still holders doing nothing, who could crash coin to $1 right?  Until those people's holdings are thinned out, prepare for sideways market movement, nothing over $500. Wanna know why?  No one with real money, or time, or work invested, is gonna continue when one rogue dumbass can bear whale still. Fact. 
Here's a thought experiment, would a coin holder who has 15,000 btc right now, give 1,000 btc to buy a Bitcoin company and make his own holdings worth more?  If not, what's the point?  Riddle me this, if a holder won't make the effort, or see the value,  then what the Fuck is the point?
One mega moon waiting holder, could have made a company, hired supernintendo lawsky with a guaranteed 7 figure contract, and fucking ended all his horseshit before one word of dumb was uttered, but Nope, moon! Right? 
Honestly not meant to be as dick as it sounds, but reality hurts. I don't want some of the folks I've met to be Elon Musk wealthy, I think that's a mistake for the entire species of man, truly and wholeheartedly. I believe that is how the future of Mike judges idiocracy starts. People with the skillset of a potato with the power to buy islands and armies is fucking terrifying, don't you think?

People work hard to bring these services to the bitcoin community, and to bitch about any fee when you are a millionaire several times over from nothing, is straight fucking wrong. This is more than one person I have experience with acting like this as well.

You can make password protected HD accounts, based on seed and passphrase, so if an attacker got your seed from a piece of paper or hardcopy, he would still need the PASSPHRASE to decrypt the proper Key table.
In that instance, you can create dummy accounts under the presumption of duress and physical access to you and device St same time. You can have the seeded normal wallet with a PIN with a few hundred dollars spending coin, and then the seeded wallet with a pin and PASSPHRASE with the real coin.

Every single one is yes. They all have baked in wealth made already, a house build in 1982 for $55,000 and rented out for 35 years netting $400,000 + profit after taxes are accounted for over that term, then expecting to sell it for $400,000, so net total profit on lifetime of ownership over 30 years on property is exceeding $750,000 and almost at $1,000,000. 
This is a simple duplex, no renovations done over 30 years, minimal. Maintenance and upkeep if any ever done.
This is why the millennial generation will never see home ownership because the generation previous vacuumed it all up, while bleeding the country dry with expected pension payouts, and then expect to sell it for profit to a hedge fund benefiting from QE and over valuations on tech and non producer asset vehicles (stocks). 
It's almost just impossible to put it all into perspective for someone who doesn't get it, but wealth was stolen and it's never coming back.

Sorry you are wrong, and its a great cover to say, "no funding sorry" but the reality is the SEC is going to be looking into wherever Garza's money went and came from, and that includes Buttercoin, since they cashed him out.

Bitcoin business owner here, I will tell you what, I'm giving up on the industry for several reasons, not the least of which is I can't keep up and feed myself, let alone pay bills or keep the bitcoins flowing with the combination of price drops and severe volatility even for bitcoin. These things coupled with people bitching about buying bitcoin at an inflated rate, when I can't even fucking eat, has bent me the wrong way for the last time. 
Wanna know how many people I have met with hundreds if not thousands of coins, who could change out business outlook instantly who do nothing except shit the coin down on unwitting newbies? A lot. Wanna know how many coins I have at this point to my name in profit? None.
From coinbase originally getting our business bank account shut down in what can only be described as anti-competitive practices, since their operation was and still is no more legal than ours to this day despite what coinbase says, thanks 
u/barmstrong! To greedy bitcoiners who just want our hard earned fiat for their free bitcoins, I can't take it anymore, I loved this with everything I had, but the entire community as a whole fucking broke me. If you can't tell I'm at my wits end as far as what bitcoin did to me over the last year, bright eyed and bushy tailed I wanted to help spread adoption through a bitcoin atm, little did I know I would personally go fiat bankrupt while doing it. 
Thanks whales! For everyone who sits and scalps on exchanges with bots for more fiat, thanks! Can't forget the rigged futures market and okcasino! You guys have all been swell. Now I need to go find a way to make back a year of lost earnings and somehow get out of the hole bitcoin helped put me into.

If this is the case, this is why banks are not allowing bitcoin companies, I have theorized this for years now since running a bitcoin ATM, EVERY single bank shust down our accounts as a company, even registered with FINcen, and had state approval to operate saying we weren't money transmitters, nope.

Ding Ding Ding. If the people who like bitcoin, are only interested in how to trade it for fiat or dollar values to get more dollars. They are going to perpetuate this system. 
Now of they start a business, grind, and accept BTC for their services and hold without cashing out for $ and only spending at other merchant that hold a portion or all of a transaction in bitcoin, we will see stagnation. 
"to acquire wealth, you must produce it" meaning, just trading value for value, will ultimately fail, and it's why the system of bitcoin was invented in the first place. 
I'll start the ball rolling, I will rent my house out in Midwest area for 1 Bitcoin static, price of USD irrelevant. Its worth $800 a month minimum. So 1 bitcoin, regardless of price per MONTH, a contract stating you pay me 1 bitcoin and you get a place to live.

More money to be made building spy and zero day type tools for bitcoin and blockchain then there is furthering it's development. 
My only real hope for true development work is folks like Cody Wilson and Amir Taaki who cannot be bought, contrast that to Jan Moller who will build spy and analysis tools for money. 
Blockstream and the like will also build tools to license for spying, any wallet controlled by a 3rd party will eventually have these tools, if you do not hold private keys assume you are being tracked, traced and put on a list.
