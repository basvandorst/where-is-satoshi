Also, the leak in question could be faked from the leaked document from Snowden right ?
Not saying it is, but technically that 16 characters string seems like a poor proof considering it could have been in the wild for a while.

I just decided to switch for a week to DDG. Honestly, I'm amazed so far! 
!bangs are just great. Instant answers kind of any. And there is a ton of useful gadgets. 
Even the simple infinite scroll list result that Google never bothered including is cool. 
Like the WOT displayed for each website. 
Honestly, I came for the privacy but DDG packs really a ton of good features. Give a try!

(french native here) There isn't a single line of text from Mark Kerpeles in this article.
I wonder how you can assess his french grammar skills from an article written by a journalist.
The fact that everyone hate Kerpeles doesn't mean we should spread bullshit about him.
EDIT: Oh I see; it's about it's personnal blog...

Just curious but is there any sort of compression already in use for that kind of data ?
I'm not saying that would be a solution but obviously it's data that could be compressed efficiently.

May I ask how much you had to select answers? 
I mean is that only a fraction of the answers you had?
EDIT : ah you already answered that below. Sorry about that.

Well, if you are convinced the trend of bitcoin will be soon downward, doesn't it makes sense to sell your coin ?
If you don't believe in a currency, why would you keep your coins ?
Selling is not immature in that context, it's the only logical decision he can take after that post.

Technically, it isn't. But thanks for spreading misinformation.
Edit: I meant that for Crystal Meth but considering those unverified rumors that all media in France has chosed​ to ignore (for legal reasons at first but now because it looks terribly fake and the timing...) are mostly displayed as facts on Reddit... That may apply to your whole comment.

Can you elaborate on the anonymous part ?
If you mine your own BTC and use them, It seems rather anonymous to me.
Or maybe you want to point out that it's only anonymous if you make the effort so that it actually is ?

Coin tumblers only makes it more difficult to track if I understand the concept correctly.
It's still possble to completely supress traceability using other mechanism.
1) Tom gives to his shady BTC launderer 5 BTC.
2) The launderer insert the 5 BTC in his wallet A.
3) The launderer gives back 5 BTC (minus fees ?) from his second independant/distinct wallet B.
The public "ledger" won't keep any connection between the original BTC and the one Tom received back. Yet the "dirty" BTC will still be present and traceable from the launderer wallet A.

As far as I know, traceability and anonymity are distinct things.
I think it's adding even more confusion to tell people it's not anonymous because there is a public ledger. It's not related.

They use the term "funds" quite a lot in their recent news. I wouldn't be worried too much for your GBP.

This was the first thing that got interested in Bitcoin.
I was on a trip in my parents house. We of course lost internet the second I step a foot at home. Consequently I decided to use tether through my smartphone 3G access. Connected my laptop via Wifi.
Then finally tried to buy something on Ebay through Paypal.
Epic fail. Paypal refused all my payments because their "automated bullshit anti fraudulent payment system" denied all of them.
Finally surrendered and called Paypal's hotline. They told me they couldn't override the security system even though I gave them a ton of  personnal infos. Only way was to get my account "certified" or some other bullshit and that needed a 48 hour long procedure...
I will do my very best not to ever use Paypal again.
Hourray for Bitcoin !
