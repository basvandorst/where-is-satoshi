Depends where you are from. If your country has high inflation or economical troubles then you can see bitcoin as gold to store value. If you like to use it for payment and don't wish a bank to find out it is  better than sending cash by mail. Otherwise you don't need it at all.

it split from serbia after serbia lost about four wars.

Weird use of the word regulate. Regulate doesn't mean bitcoin will be outlawed. In almost every country in the world it means they can tax the shit out of you.

I obviously talk about the present. You don't see people going around talking about how Michael Jackson is the king of pop. But he was ten years ago.  Deutsche Bank has way less capital than the EdB.

bad argument. I don't see how it would be difficult to encode something in the blockchain and send the location of the code to someone. Finding a code in pi on the other hand is way more difficult.

what kind of shitty bank do you have?

There was no explanation to speak of. If you don't know what bitcoin is how are you supposed to understand what decentralised currency means. Summarized it felt like "Look at these people, they are now rich but some CEO's say it's bad and now look at this random family eating dinner".

Obviously... If it had no value you wouldn't need to pay income tax on bitcoin. That is hardly suprising

I understand both... its not complicated.


I didn't. I hate these straw men arguments. But since we are putting words i each others mouths. I don't think having sex with a donkey is OK but if you want to I can't stop you.
You think SegWit is part of the base layer? And also LN? 1mB blocks are part of the base layer? There were loads of changes already. Did you even watch the video. Read the white paper of bitcoin there is a big difference between then and now.

Coca cola changed their recipe because in the blind test pepsi was favored. They never tasted the same. New coke tasted better than pepsi so the management was not doing something ridiculous. Your analogy doesn't hold since it implies we shouldn't change Bitcoin, so no LN either. Bitcoin unlike Coca Cola has to evolve.

it solves no problems in computer science. The problems you listed have been solved for ten 10 years before bitcoin emerged. If you are interested in that subject look up Bit gold.

Only two reasons stretched to look like six...

Like I said, read the white paper. None of these things are in there. I never implied a hard fork. I said evolve. You don't agree that this is an evolution?  The block size only was a soft fork because previous blocks were smaller anyway. Youre trying to catch me out while nothing I said is even remotly offenive.

The article states that they already pay taxes... I am pretty sure it will be taxed the same as any other currency
@_date: 2018-03-22 22:34:09
programmable? Are you confusing it with ethereum? Other than a currency there is nothing bitcoin can do. It sure as hell is not programmable. Computers communicating without intermediary human intervention exist since over 30 years. Bitcoin isn't even a complicated idea. One month would be more than enough if you ever used a computer before.

Not true at all where I am from. A bank may not default any money if the amount is 100000 euro or less. I am certain there are banks in america with a similar system as well.
@_date: 2018-03-20 15:02:20
Why do you always start with the consensus algorithm? I don't want to change it for fucks sake I never said I did. Stop these stupid straw men arguments. Also stop this notion that Bitcoin should be called Gaylordsmoney, its a stupid idea. The white paper shows how much bitcoin has changed, something which you for some ridiculous reasos want to refute.

what a load of rubbish
@_date: 2018-03-23 09:20:08
Nope. What you wrote is though. In Germany the government created a new Institution (Entschädigungseinrichtung deutscher Banken GmbH). All banks and credit institues in Germany have to pay contributions to this institute. No tax money is used... thats obvious. As long as a bank pays the contributions which it has to do your money is safe.
@_date: 2018-03-23 10:19:16
Any german bank not just deutsche bank. There has to be equivalents in other countries. Its not a groundbreaking idea. My printer is also deductible but I wouldn't say tax payers paid for it.

Yeah and what about scientology right guys... what are we talking about again?
