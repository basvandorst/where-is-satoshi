too bad the japanese don't seem to be taking to bitcoin much.. mtgoxJPY still has hardly any volume.. pity when it's probably the easiest country in the world to buy BTC.

people sell number only visa/mastercards and topup codes on bitmit too.
 
 
I don't think this is a really great way to buy btc.. it's anonymous though so I guess it's good for people who don't want to use their bank account.

There's your mistake.. don't use the Qt client. IMO newbies should probably use the blockchain.info web wallet. As for your other points yes the prices take some getting used too, but people can deal with that.. it's really no different than when traveling in a foreign land.

mt.gox did use a sub company that owned their dwolla account. I don't think they have the necessary mafia^Wbusiness connections to get an agreement similar to dwolla's one with veridian credit union.

if you discount it enough, i'm sure they will but yea I've never bothered trying.. you didn't say where you are but assuming it's the us you should probably create accounts with dwolla and campbx. I think there's still a month or something like that wait before dwolla will allow you to send money to a bitcoin exchange though.
