Segwit was never about increasing the blocksize.

Nope. If, for example you and your sister shop at the same supermarket, and you want to make a lightning transaction to your sister, you will only need to open a channel to the supermarket. 
You will only need to connect to the network itself. After that you can send the tx to your sister, through the supermarkets node. The tx will find it's way through the network to it's destination. That's why it's a **Network** after all. You will only need to keep a few channels online at the same time or even better: just a single one.


Yes, you need to make an on-chain tx to fill up your funds.

Can you provide some background on this?
Dream team devs? Who are those? Why did the others removed them from developing Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-01-22 06:21:26
Opening a channel requires a regular on-chain transaction.

Or just you know... don't keep 1 MILLION worth of assets on a single damn exchange. That's just straight up retarded.
@_date: 2018-01-22 08:48:19


Keeping such a huge amount of assets on an exchange is always a bad idea. Especially if the exchange has been as shady recently as Bitfinex.


I respectfully disagree. I've been involved in Bitcoin for just a month and simply reading this subreddits [FAQ]( I've learned this lesson.
@_date: 2018-01-22 22:21:18
No, I don't think so (I'm not sure). Nodes can't tell anything but the previous and next hops in the network that the tx needs to do.

You forgot spam attackers bruh.

It's definitely that, and it might be even more. Hopefully the power of smart contracts will make it possible to use LN for several things.
@_date: 2018-01-18 20:20:21
The tx fees are high right now because there is a huge unconfirmed tx backlog thats not mined yet. The LN helps with this because it lets you make txs offchain and in a secure way. You only need to make transactions on the blockchain when you open and close your LN channel. The tx fees on the testnetwork are around 10 SAT per tx,

Yeah... I will not spend 100$ to store my 5$ worth of BTC on a cold storage. A Paper wallet will be fine for me.
@_date: 2018-01-19 16:13:41
Yeah, probably Blockstream or TorGuard.

I'm going to play the devil's advocate here and say, that the EU and the ECB handled the topic of cryptocurrencies pretty well so far, so I'm not worrying about this.
@_date: 2018-01-29 07:43:15
Does it have SegWit tho'?
@_date: 2018-01-20 16:41:52
Yeah, it does not make it less likely. But if you don't have a reference, I think what's even MORE likely that you just made this stuff up. Some people can act without thinking about their own benefits or having a hidden agenda you know... 
Also, what good would it do for the LN dev team if they establish the most connected-to node on the Lightning Network?

I don't really know about businesses. The advice I've heard about cashing out large amounts of crypto is to do it in smaller installmets. Also, if we are talking about life-altering amounts of money, getting in touch with a financial advisor and a lawyer is also a good idea.

Seems like people are willing to risk their money for mainnet testing in hope of earlier adoption. Whats wrong with that?

Hopefully with the release of the new Core wallet this will change.

LN can potentially scale up to processing millions of txs per second, so yes.
@_date: 2018-01-22 23:01:31
Yup, I just looked up the same article. This means that the LN adds another security and privacy layer to the "classic" blockchain transactions. Really cool stuff.

My guess is that he refers to the market capitalization of BTC compared to other cryptos.

As far as I see, according to this prediction, the price will be around $40,000 by the end of 2018.

So if a thief gets one of my several private keys in my wallet, they have access only to the BTC connected to that private key? Not the whole wallet?

I'm fine with the limited trading pairs, for as long as they don't support BCH.

My mom has issues turning on her computer and using her email and facebook accounts. Do you honestly think older people could handle an Electrum wallet?

Can you provide source on that?
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:16:36
Sadly, Coinbase is probably still the best choice for computer illiterate people who want to get into cryptos, simply because it has the most user friendly interface.
@_date: 2018-02-07 12:42:35
Yeah, my guess is that they really want to push the Bech32 address format adoption. Luckily there is a workaround to solve that problem, so you can generate P2SH addresses with Electrum.
