Bingo.  It's a 3rd party forcing their way in and demanding payment and claiming to offer "services" in return, and consequences if you refuse.  
When groups other than government do this, they call it a "protection racket".
@_date: 2016-06-10 10:20:01
My point still stands.  Having a way to sidestep the protection racket doesn't make the mafia some virtuous organization.
@_date: 2017-01-31 16:50:06
I feel the same way about the mafia.  They offer protection in exchange for a little extortion, they give back to the community, protecting local businesses from competition, provide discounted merchandise...but if you cross them, they break your kneecaps.  They may overreach sometimes and bully people, but I know if we just got *the right people* in there, we could change it from within.  Don't just complain about the extortion and murder - BE the change you want to see in the world.
@_date: 2016-06-10 10:33:48
Your retort is simply asserting the opposite of my statement.  Tell me how avoiding a protection racket -  in which "services" are forced upon you, and funds extracted from you under threat of force - is theft.  
You sound like one of the boss' thugs saying, "the Don provides you a service...not paying is like stealing from the Don. You wouldn't want to steal from the Don, would you?  You should pay up, or..."accidents" could happen, you know?"

What has become of this and other western forms of representative government is the natural outcome of running a nation by popularity contest.  Democracy is a failure.
@_date: 2017-04-30 06:08:15
A full and direct democracy would be interesting for sure, but it's still a form of government where 51% of people are allowed to do things to the other 49% that would be considered otherwise immoral. If everyone voted in a completely direct democratic process to round up and kill all the Jewish folks, would it be any better?  What if we voted to ban gay marriage?  Or force chemical castration for all homosexuals?  What if 51% of people voted to confiscate 25% everyone's income to fund wars and social programs?  The tyranny of the majority is real. 
People cannot delegate rights, through political process or otherwise, that they do not possess, themselves.  I cannot vote for someone to murder my neighbor because I have no right to murder my neighbor.  I cannot vote to steal my neighbor's money because I have no right to do so myself. There's nothing magical about a majority that renders immoral acts moral... It's all smoke and mirrors.

Voluntary interaction.  Polycentric law.  Complete decentralization.  
We need government to build roads, right?  Nope...government just pays other people to build roads.  No reason we need politicians to take their cut off the top then dole out contracts to whoever gives them the best kickbacks.  Where there is demand for roads, someone will step up with supply.  It might look different than we know it now, but that's not necessarily a bad thing, and even if there were some disadvantages, resources would absolutely be used more efficiently and it would eliminate the farce of democracy that got us where we are today.
We need them to keep us safe!  Well, private security firms can do that without the perverse incentive to criminalize any many things as possible (so as to secure funding), and the accountability that comes with the ability take one's business elsewhere.
We need them to keep us safe from bad drugs and food and everything else?  The world is scary!  Private firms can and do provide quality assurance, testing, and certification in the free market already.  Underwriter's Laboratories is a wonderful example of how such things can work...they are the folks who make sure the toaster you brought home isn't going to burst into flames and burn your house down.  Nearly every electrical device sold in the US is UL listed, despite the lack of any legal mandate.  There's a demand for safe appliances and the market answered.
We need them for national defense, right?  Well, tell me what the incentive would be of invading an utterly decentralized society (that, incidentally, is likely well-armed).  You think The Middle East was a quagmire?  Try invading a country where there IS no central authority.  There's no way for them to surrender...you'd just be kicking a hornet's nest.  To say nothing of the fact that such a country prospering and importing and exporting like crazy, without trade restriction...no sanctions, no tariffs, no nationalism to drive protectionist policies...and no military to stir up trouble in the rest of the world.  A stateless society would be utterly pointless to attack.  
Ah...well, I figured it out.  The one thing a free market could never EVER provide.  It could never ever create a currency because you need government fiat to ensure...erm...oh shit.  This is isn't it?  Okay..nevermind.

[citation needed]  I'd would counter that *certain* danger is every bit as valid, and they certainly were in danger.  If I were to promise to murder someone 2 years from now, that person hasn't any obligation to wait until I'm at their door with a knife to take defensive action.
Again, stop using language of "legal" and "illegal"...it's not germane to the conversation at hand.  When people talk about "self defense" in this case, they aren't speaking about legal terms.  The legal system that created this mess with it's War on People (or drugs, as they put it) is merely a decidedly immoral actor in this horrible situation.  They are the source of the danger to SR users.

The appropriateness of the terminology is predicated on whether the state's response to the release of that information would be considered aggression.  
In legal parlance (which is irrelevant to the discussion which you originally criticized) , no... In plain language, using that same dictionary you mention, it absolutely is.  Drug users and dealers who have not engaged in any violent act are victims of aggression when they are imprisoned or assaulted by law enforcement officials.  If DPR was acting to protect the safety of these individuals from state aggressors, he was morally engaging in an act of defense.  Legality is irrelevant and your harping on the point is akin to me, as an IT professional, bitching about improper use of the word, "server" in a restaurant.  Your inability to recognize context makes you appear dense, and inhibits productive conversation.
Legal doublespeak merely serves to obscure the nature of the act, and I won't entertain requests to engage in such deliberately deceptive verbiage.  
@_date: 2013-07-26 17:28:54
I'm assuming you realize you'd need to pay them...because even big strong ex-army dudes need to make a living.  That being the case, I would hire a bunch of big strong ex-army dudes and form a security firm.  We would contact burntsushi and offer our protection services.
It's very very likely that others would do the same...so I'd have competition, and be incentivized to keep costs low.  Also, if one of my guys flew off the handle and assaulted a homeless guy or minority who happened to be strolling by my client's residence, that guy would be fired instantly, and restitution paid, lest the public begin thinking that my firm is a bunch of violent cowboys, rather than well-trained, disciplined security officers.
So that's how protection can be provided without coercion.
Now, let's contrast this with state security services (police).  When they fail to do their job, nothing happens.  When they beat a homeless man to death, maybe a press conference and a paid vacation for the perpetrator.  Perhaps empty promises to investigate themselves.  When they shoot a minority, it's another day at the office.  Can I call up Joe's Police Co. down the street and switch providers?  Can I not pay my cop bill (property tax) this month...call up and cancel my service?
Nope, because there's no competition, no choice, and their "services" are compulsory.  
Oh, as another example, let's pretend it's me you attempted to bully...the first month your thugs showed up, I may be out whatever amount they deprived me of.  The second month, your friends will leave in body bags.  I don't care how tough they are...they can't punch through a hail of bullets.  Owning a gun or 5 may prove to be a more economical choice than hiring Hexapus' Security Services...but at least you'd have a choice.

@_date: 2013-07-22 03:10:28


Well, it poses a threat to state-issued currency, and policy reflects as much.  So I'd say it's certainly conducive.  Gold doesn't magically bring about anarcho-capitalism, but a currency that competes with fiat is certainly a positive with regards to libertarianism/ancapism.  
It pulls things more in that direction, which is why governments tend to abandon it as a standard, and discourage its use as they grow larger and more controlling.

They certainly haven't done shit to prevent the US terrorizing Pakistan and Afghanistan with drone strikes.  160 children and counting are dead...and their parents and siblings will be the next ones to plot an attack on the US, and they will use that to justify further violations of *our* rights, and further attacks on their homelands.

I'm going to need you to justify that assertion.  The threat of being kidnapped and locked in a rape cage doesn't count?  Why?  Is it because of the magic blue uniforms your aggressors wear?  The shiny badge they flash?
Your entire argument hinges on the purchase or use of substances being anything other than a peaceful act.  This is a huge presumption.  
If anything, buying on SR made such transactions safer, less prone to violence, and better for everyone.  By shutting this site down, the state has made the purchase and use of drugs far more dangerous.

@_date: 2013-10-01 07:02:35
Not that I will excuse the actions of this individual, but the drug war is what created the climate that makes such violence possible.  
How often do you hear about shootings over a bottle of Mad Dog?  But there was massive violence and organized crime surrounding alcohol during prohibition.
Government creates black markets, and in turn, creates massive profit incentives for unscrupulous characters.  There's a reason Escobar didn't smuggle cigarettes.
In the end, far more people get hurt by the conditions created by prohibition than are ever hurt by the substance itself.  Not to mention, there's a far greater chance of innocent people being drawn into the fray, as drug cartel activities take over neighborhoods.

Whether it "holds up in court" is utterly immaterial.  Those making the case for defensive action are doing so by applying a consistent moral philosophy, not the capricious and fickle standards of a growing police state and their so-called "justice system".  Conviction in a court of law has no bearing on whether someone's actions were right or wrong.
@_date: 2013-10-08 10:06:31
Exactly...no one buys the "reefer madness" shit anymore...you have to frame the drug trade itself as a violent and dangerous element of society.  Link it to terrorism, gang violence, etc...nevermind that prohibition is what *creates* the conditions for this violence.
If people start seeing that people not only use, but purchase high-quality substances from reputable sources without a violent element, they'll start questioning the necessity of the state's War on ~~Drugs~~ People.

Absolutely no one making this argument is suggesting he will escape prosecution on these grounds.  They are discussing whether DPR's actions were justified under the non aggression principal, and how such a situation might play out hypothetically in a libertarian justice system.  No one is speaking of a legal defense here.

No, I mean it takes away power from the corrupt people.  Why buy an impotent legislator.  Bitcoin puts power back in the hands of the people...puts their activities outside of the reach of political power.
As a completely made up example I pulled out of my ass:
Big tobacco buys a senator to get regulation against e-cigs passed.  Well, now people can order it with bitcoin online from anywhere in the world, and the regulation is meaningless.  In practice it will have *some* effect, of course, but I'm saying it lessens the influence of political power.

So, your sense of morality is defined by the state then?  If the state doesn't call it "self defense" it's murder in your mind, is it?
Just remember, everything that happened to the Jews in Nazi Germany was *legal*.
*This* is the discussion at hand.  Not what some corrupt state defines as legal/not legal, self-defense/murder.  We are discussing reality, not juiced up legal terms designed to justify kidnapping and extortion.

I was (probably incorrectly) interchanging "ideals" and "philosophy"...I actually looked back over my comment and considered changing the word, but was on my phone and was too lazy.
But yes, gold as a currency is compatible in the sense that no government can print more of it...which is tangential to core libertarian philosophy, the issue being forced monopolization of a fiat currency (which in turn allows for inflation and much of the other nastiness we see).  Also, it also has a small edge over paper fiat in the area of anonymity, since you don't need a serial # to make it valid.

I have yet to see the NSA make any effort to take down a US drone, or prevent the US government from picking sides in middle eastern conflicts, so at best they are way too selective in which sort of terrorism they are against.

Bitcoin will make government obsolete anyway.

Erm...your logic doesn't follow.  By robbing the bank, you were committing an actual act of aggression.  Operating SR was a peaceful activity, for which he was blackmailed by this person, and the person didn't only threaten to harm him, but thousands of other peaceful people who used SR.

If doing so puts them in immediate danger (and it unquestionably does), it's certainly worth discussing.  It's hardly black and white, as you seem to suggest.

Net neutrality is a great concept which would certainly influence my ISP buying decision (such that it is in the current market)... but the absolute last thing I want is government involvement of any kind. All of the crazy hyperbole everyone is spewing about it in this thread is ridiculous. 
There is no mandated net neutrality right now... And even in this manipulated, distorted marketplace severely limited competition, none of this crazy apocalyptic stuff is happening... And the more alternatives (like Google fiber) become available, the less likely it is to ever get that bad, and the more the trends in that direction will reverse. 
On the other hand, has a government program ever reduced in scope, cost, or reach over time? Is everyone completely blind to history?

Cool... So what the Nazis did wasn't murder, because it was *legal*.  Gotcha.

Nah...when a violent street gang shoots someone for crossing into their territory or wearing the wrong colors, the action is publicly decried.  No one blames the victim or makes excuses for the gang.
When government thugs cage, maim, sexually assault, or murder someone who broke one of *their* rules (such as purchasing a prohibited substance, or failing to pay protection money, or trying to bring 4oz of liquid on an airplane), the public at large shrugs and says, "He knew the rules".  
There is no outrage.  There is no community movement to make our streets safe.  There are no youth intervention programs to prevent children from falling into careers in government.  
Very very few people perceive agents of the state as the common criminals they are.

So long as you use unobfuscated language, they certainly are.  But throw a magic shiny badge and a nice costume into the equation, and the nature of an act changes, right?  Tell me, were the German officers rounding up Jews in the 40s aggressors?
