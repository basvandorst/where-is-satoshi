Hmm those queues don't look that big and the press love to hype a bank run story. Can anyone from Greece confirm this?
@_date: 2015-07-12 21:39:07
Someone earlier said not to do this but I'll look into it. This suggestion has been both upvoted and downvoted in seperate comments. Confused.
@_date: 2015-07-12 21:41:39
Yep this is the reason it's cutting out, it's currently on its side vent in the air.
@_date: 2015-07-12 20:34:14
Don't have access to another computer at present.

@_date: 2015-07-12 20:38:31
Why what is it?
@_date: 2015-07-12 20:32:33
Already done this, marginally better but as I said it's 2 years worth and the laptop cuts out frequently...
Are Electrum or Multibit options for me, don't know much about them?
@_date: 2015-07-12 20:44:30
Been looking at Electrum as an option, know little about it though.
@_date: 2015-07-12 21:40:02
reluctant to do so as I don't wanna break it entirely
@_date: 2015-07-12 22:12:37
It just went from 70% to 58%, stop toying with me : (
@_date: 2015-07-12 21:39:24
There's 1 in there.
@_date: 2015-07-12 21:39:42
Thanks man
@_date: 2015-07-12 20:43:25
Ah I see
@_date: 2015-07-12 21:38:30
Thanks dude
@_date: 2015-07-12 23:21:35
Yeh as soon as it gets close it overheats and cuts off.
@_date: 2015-07-12 21:51:32
Letting it ride, currently on 67.77%, fingers crossed.
@_date: 2015-07-12 22:21:15
Currently on 95.35% please don't cut out on me now, shitty laptop...
@_date: 2015-07-12 22:47:28
Awesome How....?
@_date: 2015-07-12 20:47:36
"It's probably easiest to wait for the sync to complete"
This is the crux of my problem.
@_date: 2015-07-12 22:24:54
Yep you're right... Ah I see why this has generated more interest than I expected. This is like a crap version of one of those "I just found a safe" posts. Only I already told you what's in it...
@_date: 2015-07-12 20:58:11
It will not load. After the last time the computer cut, I restarted and got the error "Error opening block database. Do you want to rebuild the block database now?"
Just had to start again from scratch, narrowly resisted urge to run outside into the street and fling this shitty laptop into the traffic.
