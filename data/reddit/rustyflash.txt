A bank terminal which is used for a total of 50min a day but is running 24/7 is waste of energy.

The full-time troll on Twitter is not the leader of this dollar shitcoin imo
Anyway... I agree that it's a worthless shitcoin. Clearly a bubble. Wait for it. Don't buy the dip ffs

Only futurists can see the future. The masses are stuck in the present. They got no time and energy to think about the future.

Love how /all is making assumptions on stuff that OP has never written in the first place lmao
There we go again fuckers... again and again...
@_date: 2018-01-13 17:27:02
I can't.
Have to buy EV and solar panels to bring regular costs down to a minimum so I can buy more bitco... wait a sec...
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:22:46
I'm here for the good memes.
Don't need financial advice. I'm into cryptos so I am a financial expert by nature.
@_date: 2018-01-16 17:03:57
It's really funny how the people who blamed everyone else for being a stupid tinfoil hat became absolutely ridiculous tinfoil hats. Within a few days!!!
Who is controlling the world "deeper"? The fuckin Bilderbergilluminatigoldmansachs or is it just almighty Putin lmao
Who cares? Hey, if Washington Post decides tomorrow that friggin Powdiepie is the man behind the curtain then everybody would go like "Ok, he is clearly pulling the strings."
I stopped arguing with these zombies.

You are top comment.
Still hope for mankind.
Can't wait for my cryptos to TESLA 2 the moooooon
@_date: 2018-01-16 17:34:09
Which is true I guess?!
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:40:25
I thought the picture should look better than the actual product? u know... marketing and shit...
@_date: 2018-01-16 17:30:46
Bullshit John! You made your first big dollars with selling shit that didn't work. Funny thing is that it was broken weapons and as far as I know guns should work to get some blood in the streets.
"Never take financial advice from people who want to rip YOU off."
Common sense
@_date: 2018-01-19 00:42:40
So they can decide between:
Being completely fucked
Being completely meaningless
I'm fine with both outcomes.
@_date: 2018-01-09 00:44:39
I would even invest more.
If I make 10k with cryptos tomorrow then I would probably order a solar roof for 10k the day after lol
If I make 100k with cryptos I would invest with other people into one big fucking EV charging station which gets powered by solar roofs and backup batteries.
If I make 10mil with cryptos I'm building that shit myself lol

Yes you are. Any Tesla is absolutely fine!
edit: It's not a sports car. You can fit parents+ 2 children in the upcoming roadster. It's gonna be the perfect all-day family ride.
@_date: 2018-01-09 00:02:26
Guess nobody would argue against that.
@_date: 2018-01-09 01:07:12
growing like cryptos
@_date: 2017-12-31 13:13:05
Thx bro! I thought the general public was well educated about the topic.

@_date: 2018-03-30 22:19:17
It doesn't matter if the justification is "good enough".
It already works very well for a lot of things. Just because you don't take part in it, doesn't mean those things don't exist.
@_date: 2018-02-15 22:40:05
Women, gay people and religious minorities?
@_date: 2018-03-11 14:25:19
I do.
@_date: 2018-03-11 12:25:51
It won't be banned globally so the people who want to make money with it and work in that field would just move and probably would make a lot more in the future. If things get banned somewhere the people living in the country where it's legal start to make more money since bans don't have a big influence on real demand. It's just paper.
A lot of drugs are banned in a lot of countries but I can assure you that production and demand for all drugs has always been in a good state.
If cryptos become the safest option to pull off a "criminal" action due to increased government surveillance and paranoia than what would happen with it's value/price?
@_date: 2018-02-15 14:04:50
This is true imo.

@_date: 2018-02-22 18:10:41
That's why I think this picture has more truth in it than some might think.
You can end banks. You can shut them down, blow them up, kill 'em all... a lot of things we can think about.
Which of those examples would also be possible for bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-03-02 14:14:13
You capitalize verbs in German if you use them nominal.
@_date: 2018-02-14 14:18:39
Remember when there was a "1" before that 9000? Wasn't that long ago lmao
@_date: 2018-02-15 13:55:13
It's not. Very common in developed countries to buy real estate before it's actually finished.
@_date: 2018-02-22 18:16:52
It's funny how many of you don't give a crap about crypto and rather worship the almighty bankers cause they are almighty so nobody should even think about establishing something else lol
@_date: 2018-02-08 16:00:08

We didn't all live in Africa the last hundreds of years. We developed different from each other. Assuming that all races are equal with their intellectual capability is crazy to me when almost everything else is different.
In fact - You can measure it everywhere.
There is a reason why white asians do very, very good in intellectual fields f.e.
We can just accept that. Why do we have to be so upset about the fact that we are NOT equal? It won't change anything.
@_date: 2017-05-14 22:08:56

No. I use cars the same way.
@_date: 2017-05-14 22:20:05
I think you made very clear what's the right thing to do.
