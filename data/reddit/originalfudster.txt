I know the OP was talking about holding, waiting years for the investment to grow in value and something about staying faithful to the one and only Bitcoin, so even I don't believe what I'm about to say. But for the sake of argument, I'll point out that it is possible to turn less than $50k into $2.8M by trading between Bitcoin and alt coins. If he did that, he wasn't actually holding Bitcoin, but at least he was holding crypto currencies as opposed to cashing out for fiat. At that point he would've cheated on his Bitcoin wife however. Either way, I agree, he's full of shit.

That would be true for a traditional investment, like capital assets or even equity. When you can predict with reasonable accuracy that the investment is underperforming yet insist on holding on to it, then you are in a sunk cost trap. 
Similarly, it would be true if you were gambling that money at a casino. When you keep playing that roulette with "house money" even though the odds are against you, you are in a sunk cost trap.
However, crypto currencies are not traditional investments. There's no way of predicting with reasonably accuracy that the investment is underperforming. No one knows what the proper value of, say, Bitcoin is. There are no balance sheets and PL statements to look at. Six months from now the coin could be traded at $600, or it could be traded at $60,000.
Crypto currencies aren't like roulette, either. The odds aren't against you. If anything, it's like poker. The odds are the same for all of us, and with enough skill and a bit of favourable variance you can keep on winning.
There are no sunk costs in crypto currencies, as long as the whole damn thing doesn't collapse for good.
