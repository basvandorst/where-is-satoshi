For all those hating Bitstamp in this thread: Good luck trading on Bitfinex again.

They are not asking for 1 million BTC, they said that they will give the files to the best files to the highest bidder, but they could also give more files if the auction achieves 1 million BTC.
Besides, maybe 1m BTC doesn't sound too high for those who know what are in these files.

Thankfully I was around in 2013 to learn with Mt. Gox that I should always keep control of my BTC.
@_date: 2018-01-10 19:42:08
So what are them?
@_date: 2018-01-08 01:18:51
Bitcoin Cash might work for you.
@_date: 2018-01-09 20:50:18
No. Satoshi said the block size should be increased by changing maxblocksize and not by changing bitcoin into segwitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-08 01:24:31
They're opening a champagne
@_date: 2018-01-10 16:39:12
Because it is a spam.
@_date: 2018-01-08 01:20:01
Bitcoin has already increased the block size. The fork is called bitcoin cash.

Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System  - Satoshi Nakamoto
"Bitcoin can already scale much larger than that (Visa) with existing hardware for a fraction of the cost."  - Satoshi Nakamoto
It can be phased in, like: if (blocknumber &gt; 115000) maxblocksize = largerlimit
It can start being in versions way ahead, so by the time it reaches that block number and goes into effect, the older versions that don’t have it are already obsolete. - Satoshi Nakamoto
Would you like a few more?

I've quoted him saying all those things in my comments in this thread. The dev team doesn't want to follow original bitcoin vision as it was described in the white paper, so the only one (Gavin, who was chosen by satoshi to continue his work) who tried that had to leave and now is working on bitcoin cash.
@_date: 2018-01-08 01:42:11
You are probably referring to the option to go to coinbase, convert btc to usd, withdrawal usd to your bank account and then use these usd to pay for your Microsoft purchase?
@_date: 2018-01-31 16:00:06
But the devs said BTC is not for spending, it is only for holding. Shouldn't we wait a few more days until the savior LN gets ready?
@_date: 2018-01-09 20:54:31
Altcoin discussion shouldn't be allowed here.
@_date: 2018-01-09 15:11:05
You have no idea what you're talking about.
Email from Satoshi Nakamoto to Mike Hearn:
"Hi Mike,
I'm glad to answer any questions you have. If I get time, I ought to write a FAQ to supplement the paper.
There is only one global chain.
The existing Visa credit card network processes about 15 million Internet purchases per day worldwide. Bitcoin can already scale much larger than that with existing hardware for a fraction of the cost. It never really hits a scale ceiling. If you're interested, I can go over the ways it would cope with extreme size.  By Moore's Law, we can expect hardware speed to be 10 times faster in 5 years and 100 times faster in 10. Even if Bitcoin grows at crazy adoption rates, I think computer speeds will stay ahead of the number of transactions.
I don't anticipate that fees will be needed anytime soon, but if it becomes too burdensome to run a node, it is possible to run a node that only processes transactions that include a transaction fee. The owner of the node would decide the minimum fee they'll accept. Right now, such a node would get nothing, because nobody includes a fee, but if enough nodes did that, then users would get faster acceptance if they include a fee, or slower if they don't. The fee the market would settle on should be minimal. If a node requires a higher fee, that node would be passing up all transactions with lower fees. It could do more volume and probably make more money by processing as many paying transactions as it can. The transition is not controlled by some human in charge of the system though, just individuals reacting on their own to market forces.
Eventually, most nodes may be run by specialists with multiple GPU cards. For now, it's nice that anyone with a PC can play without worrying about what video card they have, and hopefully it'll stay that way for a while. More computers are shipping with fairly decent GPUs these days, so maybe later we'll transition to that."

Anyone know the details(maturity, IR, payment schedule, etc) of this bond ?
@_date: 2015-06-19 12:25:55
Thanks. Now I understand why bitcoin price just dropped.
@_date: 2015-06-09 18:33:34
exchangewar.info is listing usecryptos.com as the biggest brazilian exchange, although it doesnt look brazilian at all. They  dont have BRL trades neither bank transfers to brazilian banks.
@_date: 2015-05-23 17:39:56
Nice idea. Thanks for your work.
I have a few questions:
where are the transactions?
How does a miner include a transactions  in a block? 
Why does a miner include a transaction in a block ?
@_date: 2015-05-30 15:41:18


Since blocks already have an average of about 500kb and the limit is 1mb, this attack would have cost 40x more with a limit of 20mb.
@_date: 2015-05-30 16:28:11
Well, but the attack cant be effective this way, since miners would prioritize normal transactions with standard fees. So the only transactions that would be delayed by the network would be those of the attackers.
@_date: 2015-05-31 05:56:03
Just change your btc for monero on any exchange and do whatever you want with your moneros. You have privacy and anonymity.

Individuals in China have a limit of 50k usd a year to move money out of the country. Companies have to ask for the government permission to do so.
@_date: 2019-02-09 23:50:56
Sometimes I wonder why people still cares about this guy.
@_date: 2015-07-14 23:02:47
He fails to understand the reason why chinese NEED to buy bitcoins, which is the same reason that makes the arbitrage between btcusd and btcrmb to be impossible. Besides, the "inflow/outflow" of money on the bitcoin economy has nothing to do with the economic activity by itself.
@_date: 2015-07-15 01:01:02

This sub is unbelievable. How can this post get 100 upvotes?
@_date: 2017-04-30 20:09:42
I find it very worrisome that someone like Nick Szabo says this kind of things. In the end it means that he believes bitcoin is flawed by design and can't survive without the help of an organization like core to protect it against evil agents. Maybe that's why the altcoins are gaining so much market cap.
@_date: 2017-04-30 22:09:30
Well, if that's the case then bitcoin is flawed and it can't last much longer. What makes bitcoin valuable is actually its trustless properties, which no other currency in the world has. If it turns out that bitcoin doesn't have this attribute then it is just like any other fiat currency, just a bit fancier.

The first comment is wrong. ETFs buy the underlying asset every time there is new money coming into the fund. What they do on a monthly basis is probably recalibrate the positions between the currencies.

I get what I pay for. I am using my personal situation to prove that it will be possible to run a full node in Brazil, with a connection that costs only 25usd monthly, even with a much higher block size limit.
@_date: 2017-05-12 02:02:42
I live in Brazil, the case you posted was in US. My claim was about Brazil and I've never heard about a similar case here. The post from this topic is bullshit as many people already explained.

Do you read? I said I live in Brazil and you show me a link with a case from US claiming it is a proof that my internet is not good for running a full node with a maxblocksize bigger than 1mb?
This whole post is bullshit. Most of the countries outside of africa and the middle East do have access to an internet connection much better than the poster claims.
