I was wondering bitcoin has been around since 2012 but I notice it wasn't until May of this year when all these crytocoins go up. Is there any particular event that triggered this
@_date: 2017-12-05 09:19:34

@_date: 2018-05-10 19:49:07

I have a question , i currently have btc in a legacy bitcoin address in coinomi and i was wondering if it is a good idea to transfer it to a ledger nano s with a segwit address? 
@_date: 2017-02-14 10:16:52
do we need to show id even if we are looking to buy small amount of bitcoin like 900 worth. I thought id was only for over 2k
@_date: 2017-08-14 04:26:17
that was for accounts before 8/1/2017. seems account after this date required verification
@_date: 2017-08-13 22:31:36
Just wondering how you can buy so much btc, did you use an exchange like coinbase and did you have to wire them money and I am not sure if bitcoin will eventually go back down and altcoin will go up
@_date: 2017-08-14 02:53:45
well besides shapeshift, are there any alternatives? I want to get some neo but shapeshift does not have it
@_date: 2016-11-01 02:59:46
I had the same thing happen isn't there anything i can do
@_date: 2017-11-09 23:08:36
You should not keep so much in the exchange and use several exchanges. Also you can try getting their physical address and perhaps traveling there and talk to someone. It is surprising they give so little information.

Anyone here ever use western union online to send cash to buy bitcoin? Do they ask for a lot of identify verificaiton questions
@_date: 2017-11-02 08:15:00
oh you can still buy even without verification?
@_date: 2017-11-19 10:48:14
I mean for the western union. Did you just western union the money and provided your bitcoin address
@_date: 2017-11-06 08:03:57


wow what a pain. That stopped me from buying then
Was there coinbase then
@_date: 2017-11-03 09:18:43

@_date: 2017-11-03 05:00:20

@_date: 2017-11-06 07:50:37


I think DCix had a reverse stock split
@_date: 2017-11-02 07:25:42
@_date: 2017-11-03 07:03:31
were you able to buy immediately or did your account need to go thru verification
@_date: 2019-02-27 10:57:27
what made you say that
@_date: 2017-11-19 10:42:16
how did you buy it
@_date: 2017-11-03 08:45:42
how long did it take? and was it 4% for using credit card? did credit card post as cash advance
@_date: 2017-11-06 07:51:37
how did you get btc back then?
@_date: 2017-11-03 06:33:25
I was wondering if you always buy bitcoin from atm and then you buy it once from coinbase and transfer to your litecoin or eth wallet, does it expose your litecoin or eth wallet to coinbase? 
@_date: 2017-11-19 10:40:34
how did you trust the seller before and how did you trust the facebook group
@_date: 2017-11-02 06:49:26
craigslist is not safe because sometimes people don't show up a lot of trouble
@_date: 2017-11-02 05:56:15
It is a software not website?
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:22:33
They already did distribution nov 8 they sold too soon
@_date: 2017-11-06 07:47:46
how did you buy bitcoin in those days?
@_date: 2017-11-06 07:47:51
how did you buy bitcoin in those days?
@_date: 2017-11-07 20:39:42
was mt gox rate low?
@_date: 2017-11-08 09:30:11
did you keep all the btc you earn or converted it to fiat
@_date: 2018-02-02 03:38:26
what if you buy gbtc (bitcoin stock) do you still need to report that seperately or will it be lik ea stock
@_date: 2018-03-08 10:33:31
but coinbase ban accounts if you send funds to a casino bitcoin address so isn't this concept similar
@_date: 2017-10-10 01:35:04
Just wondering , how did you the keylogger get to your pc? also all these years how did the person who install the keylogger know you had bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-10-10 01:33:01
oh how?
@_date: 2017-10-25 08:32:33
i mean if you need to buy bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-10-28 10:00:01
I try localbitcoin but when buying bitcoin in person what is the safest way? If he hand the person cash first that person might run away but the other person won't transfer the bitcoin until we give the cash
@_date: 2017-05-16 01:41:56
what is your oldest date? perhaps amazon takes awhile to check
@_date: 2017-05-16 02:06:14
oh you should never trust exchange with bitcoin because they always find every excuse to hold bitcoin , as soon as you get bitcoin just cashout . Did you tweet 
@_date: 2017-05-08 06:28:07
Did you have any money there, did they return your money
@_date: 2017-05-05 18:26:37
why did you wait until 2017 to announce this and not earlier.
@_date: 2017-05-02 06:17:06
was it an automated latter and did it require responding to. that amount seems low
@_date: 2017-05-16 01:54:30
did they contact you yet or provided more details? Also, what was the why you never transfer the bitcoin out. 
@_date: 2017-05-13 06:32:04
Just wondering what is the best network to buy bitcoin from? Should I use coinbase or some other network
@_date: 2017-05-16 00:55:22
but if that is the case shouldn't amazon block his account for using stolen gc
@_date: 2017-05-08 06:31:37
The thing with bitcoin is that it has a history a lot of users, the LTC and ETH are still too new at the moment
@_date: 2017-05-07 11:14:34
Do you know much in savings we are talking about based on percentage like rough guess. I also do mining on the cpu, but these are 7700k processor we are talking about. 
@_date: 2017-05-29 00:49:08
How is it possible that one guy from China has so much power. It makes no sense considering bitcoin got adapted in US first
@_date: 2017-05-27 18:02:50
oh for both? For hero and the other one?
