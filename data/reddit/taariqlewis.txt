Congratulations to the Chronicled team! By tracking sneaker authenticity and provenance, they're opening up a whole new use case for the blockchain.  People have been talking about doing this for a long time, but Ryan and his team are actually executing. This is a fabulous use of the blockchain and could be humongous if it catches on!

I am sorry, but it's my view that sidechains are delegating long term innovation off the main bitcoin blockchain and over to these sidechains. If anything, that will lower iteration and change in bitcoin core and allow further forks to freely innovate or copy sidechain innovations into full forks with their own hashing power. 
The incentives for speculative profit will always be higher for developers if they fork or copy good ideas and launch a competing coin for short-term profits. Developers aren't going to wait around for long term innovation and the bitcoin core developers have just taken annoying calls for blockchain innovation off their plates. 
This won't hurt bitcoin per se, but I believe sidechains will allow for faster creation of a better bitcoin replacement or fork using bitcoin as low-cost, low-risk lab before a full fork.

Building an effective compliance program to protect customers and prevent criminals from abusing your business is an important step towards reducing your risk.
**Topics we will discuss include:**
* What laws and regulations apply to digital currencies and digital currency systems?
* How do these laws apply to various business models?
* How can a company comply?
* What happens if a company can’t comply?
* Can officers, directors and employees be liable? What about investors?
* Are companies outside the US also expected to comply with these laws?

Via Maaku (Maaku7 on Reddit): 
"First, a significant amount of work needs to be built on the “burn” transaction before it is used to claim the coins on the other chain, for the simple reason of avoiding DoS attacks. Then there is a length of time called the quieting period during which the return transaction and associated proofs are published, but not finalized, and anyone else can step forward with a reorg proof and rollback the transaction. Finally, there is a period of time afterwards analogous to the coinbase maturity where the coins are not spendable because a reorg could undo the peg transaction.
So that's three different waiting periods, each of which would probably be in the range of 100 - 144 blocks, if not more. The exact parameters are not set in stone at this moment, but with that in mind we should expect a peg transaction to take at least 2-3 days to fully clear, depending on the final choice of parameters."

Thank you for posting this. There are assumptions about miner behavior with sidechains that have yet either to be explained or put into practice. 
~~If mergemining is an "option" for miners, they can hold any chain hostage. Ideally, miners would be smart to collude to set mergemining fees at a rate that all miners will benefit from sidecoins that really want the protection and can fund the cost.
Ah, to be a bitcoin miner right now! Good times!~~
EDIT: I think we have a fork of explanations here that appear contradictory to my uneducated eye. Will either or clarify the two claims on the requirement for merge mining? 
Much of my questions around the issue surrounded the requirement for merge mining, but now it seems that merge mining is no longer required. Help please?


Merge mining may well be a good idea, but it's not a fundamental requirement of the approach.

Thanks for sharing that point. Yes, Zerocoin-type functionality can be implemented here, but again, if that functionality is not &gt;= potential for profits, then you'll Zerocoin-type functionality blossom on the altcoins first before a sidechain or you'll see both, but the altcoin version may get more usage as the economic incentives (especially to the developers of the altcoin) are higher.
@_date: 2014-04-12 13:09:58
I think you'd still need to convince miners to mergemine any and all the sidechains and there's no requirement for them to agree to this. They may just not like what your sidechain for some reason or the other. 
Therefore, security guarantees still lead preference for (1) and (2), but not (3) and well, what about (4)?

Can we do some more analysis on the transaction fees assertion? I am intrigued, but I don't see the full picture. Won't those fees will be constrained by the amount of BTC that went into creating your coin? You'll need more BTC to keep up the fees to both miners and to your side-chain developers. Compared to the cheap/low cost way folks create altcoins, I'm wondering how high these fees will need to be to incentivize sidechain use. Thoughts?

*"This is getting into implementation details, so pay close attention to the parts which seem contradictory. Conceptually anyone who wants sidecoins and has bitcoins or vice versa can simply move value from one chain to the other, in essence destroying bitcoins and printing sidecoins albeit in a reversible process. However, this takes a considerable amount of time to clear -- about 3 days -- and blockchain space which requires fees. So in practice we fully expect that someone wanting to trade bitcoins for sidecoins will use a distributed marketplace and atomic cross-chain swaps in order to buy one coin with another, by finding a buyer at the other side. Use of the pegging mechanism will be limited to market makers who arbitrage when the price starts to deviate from the peg. Make sense?"* Source: [Maaku Explains BTC restoration with sidechains](

3 Problems with Sidechains as so far presented to us: Economics 101: Profit Incentives.
* No economic or profit incentive for speculators (good or bad)
No sidechain coin can make a profit over it's original, pegged BTC value to the coinholder. Given this fixed exchange rate, if it's cheaper and easier to make speculative profit with an altcoin fork, forks will continue. If you think have an idea for a truly innovative altcoin or protocol, why peg it to BTC when it can attract millions of dollars in funding? Even quality crypto innovation has little incentive to peg itself to BTC's value: See Ethereum
* No security guarantees against a 51% attack.
Merge mining requires convincing miners to mergemine your sidechain. Even though this is a low cost for miners to update their software, you are the mercy of the miners' decision making process. If you fail to convince a miner or pool, your chain will be as insecure as an altcoin, but now without profit opportunity. Miners will then prioritize on economic incentives for their hashing power. If you can supply none to the miners, then you are just as insecure or maybe less secure than an altcoin fork. It would be in the miners interest to demand a "pay-me-to-mergemine-your-sidechain" incentive in the same way many altcoins pay to be listed on the altcoinexchanges, such as Cryptsy, but this time it's BTC pegged value. That's free money for miners.
* No lower costs than creating an altcoin fork of bitcoin/litecoin
Creating a sidechain requires creating a coin that must be secured somewhow. Since this coin is "firewalled" from Bitcoin, development of a timestamping ledger (blockchain) will require new software development. Given that we already have forks of bitcoin and litecoin with established blockchain creation software, altcoin forks still appear cheaper than sidechains.
EDIT: If my economics blows, let me know with a comment attached to your downvote. I'm sure I can learn something I missed.
@_date: 2014-04-10 23:52:39
Today's investors invest in premines all the time. I am always amazed that they keep investing (See Isracoin), but then again, they do this because they are speculators who are looking for floating coin price action. They buy/mine cheap, extremely low cost coins and then for trade these on the altexchanges for BTC or LTC. If this behavior wasn't profitable, premines would die off, but profits are to be had and the alt exchanges encourage this behavior. I'm not sure that to simply assert the sidechain's existence will be enough to discourage premines. If you can't ban the behavior or provide greater incentives to do other behaviors, the forks will continue.

Thanks Vitalik, but do you have any crypto of fiat examples to backup the assertion that spending subsidies will not substantially reduce hoarding? The Hollywood example is interesting, but I'm talking about microeconomic models that mimic the ideal cyrpto-economic players and behavior models. In my view, if we want cyrpto to act like a good substitute for fiat, we should look at what spending subsidies do for US government when investment and hoarding (banks not making loans for private investment) is low. In Bitcoin, we have barely any lending economy (excluding Bitfinex SWAP market) so I think we have a problem.
For example, the Obama Tax in the form of stimulus checks to consumers. Did that increase hoarding/savings or consumption? Hal Varian is an economist I respect and his thoughts (  were that in the absence of private investment (more bitcoin businesses) stimulating demand and spending is your only alternative. So, Iit would seem to me that spending subsidies via Proof of Transaction should encourage more spending and less hoarding. 
I'm no Economist, but I don't see any evidence that says more spending subsidies actually do not substantially reduce hoarding behaviors when implemented across the entire population of available wallets. Instead, I see the opposite and the opportunity for increased economy. Of course, I'm open to be educated of any errors in my understanding.

No the bitcoins are suspended and the sidechain will hold the new cointypes with their new blockchain. 
However, if you ever dare use a CFD on a sidechain, please don't tell me. CFDs depend on stable underlyings to function properly. Bitcoin only has 12MM+ units today and is highly illiquid. If your sidechain (derived from bitcoins) is a CFD contract, then there's an incentive for me to print up bad news about China and bitcoins and watch your CFDs lose value as I take up the other side to drink up the profits. 
Hold on. Excuse me..my mouth just began to water and I have to put my fangs back inside. The smell of blood...you see..I hope you understand.

Yes. That's what they are, but that doesn't mean they aren't useful. There are quite a few use cases on proposal including smart contracts and other asset-issuances as well as other coin innovations. If you have no care for the speculative profits of your coin's demand, then this would be an ideal use case, but you'd still have to secure your blockchain somehow.

At DigitalTangible we were founded on 3 key principles.
* **We never touch our customer funds:**  All DigitalTangible transactions on our site take place directly between our network of gold dealers or our via P2P trading catalog. The power of Bitcoin allows our customers to conduct direct purchases with our gold dealers and other customers.
* **We never touch our customer's gold:** All our gold is shipped to and stored in a distributed network of bonded, insured depositories. Our customers use their PrivateKeys on their Bitcoin addresses to control the flow and direction of their gold assets. Our customers can verify their gold holdings independently of us and we display all holdings publicly.
* **We are regulatory compliant:** We perform KYC/AML on all purchasing and trading customers in our system so that bad actors cannot attempt to redeem any of our Counterparty gold tokens for physical gold or cash and use our platform as means to subvert the law. Thus, all customers can acquire gold Counterparty tokens on our platform can trade with confidence and security that the system is both transparent and secure. 
It is our objective to change the way any person can acquire real, physical gold for trade, investment, and payments.

Remember Maaku's last sentence of my submit above? 
"Use of the pegging mechanism will be limited to market makers who arbitrage when the price starts to deviate from the peg." Maaku
So yes, there will be market makers who will arbitrage from bitcoins to Fubar when the price begins to drift from the peg so they can profit from this activity. I'm not sure who can qualify to be a market maker, but maybe the company building this Sidechain technology may issue market maker licenses for this activity. This is my understanding so I may be incorrect as well.
@_date: 2014-04-10 17:55:56
Thanks for sharing. Okay my review of your thoughts.


Why? Just because it's possible doesn't mean it's profitable. Why would moving to a sidechain be rational profit seeking for any coin which exists to maximize all possible profits for the developer of that coin?


Well more is better than less and having security from the biggest herd is better than trying to secure from scratch. Also when 1,000 sidechains ask the small pool of miners for mergemining hash power, how will this work out?


What inspired your conclusion here? The data seems to show different given the many scamcoins with positive marketcaps. Most of the scammy coins prove that you can spend maybe just $1,000 making up a terrible coin, get some mining pools to mine the coin and then create $103,299,186 literally overnight Source: [Coinmarketcap.com Isracoin 04/10/2014]( 
Question: Given the easy profits, why would any rational developer give up profits to stay on a sidechain?
@_date: 2014-04-10 16:28:51

I agree with your first point. No argument there. 
I'm not sure about the second and third sentences. I'm not sure how the Mastercoin example fits here so I can't respond intelligently. I also don't understand the last sentence. I'm not sure what proprietary software you're referring to given that all software from altcoin forks are open sourced as well. 
Maybe I have it wrong after all. I'll guess we'll see how this evolves.

But have you even studied the restaurant business? It's highly fragmented for that very reason it is an exception. Now, extrapolate that to mining and what you get? Fragmentation of coins like we see with every new Scrypt coin for the past year throwing out new tokens. Centralization's power to discourage coin forking has some value. Centralization supports network effects and increases the cost of fragmentation, which for digital money is not always a bad thing. 
@_date: 2014-04-10 18:24:28
Good catch. It's supposed to be free for miners. However, that doesn't mean any miner will merge mine your coin. You are dependent on them to say YES and that still requires economic incentive. They don't have to even pick up the phone and answer your call if they don't want to do so.
@_date: 2014-04-11 14:51:08
This is an excellent model. Do you have any current bitcoin market behavior that either validates your model or correlates closely with it?  
My observations show that over 200+ altcoin forks validate the need for easy short-term speculative profits in illiquid markets. Folks like their speculation and don't mind losing BTC if the profits are big enough to trade. Remember, when I ask for exposure to ethers, I am asking for outsized profits with the possibility of a full loss. 
If folks (bitcoin and litecoin fork and feature developers) really cared about bitcoin value insurance, we'd see more demand for that feature today in the markets, but we don't. Why is that?
@_date: 2014-04-18 21:19:45

@_date: 2014-04-10 23:45:32
If we don't understand the alignment of incentives then I think it's hard to argue that sidechains will disrupt the current process for launching altcoins. Yes, I agree that there will be some niche markets for sidechaincoins, but now we're really not talking about a game changer or disruptor as advertised. We're guessing about the process. Also, the costs to launch an altcoin with your own software still seems more cheaper and frictionless than trying to bid on tx fees with miners who or may not like your particular sidechain.

Well even if sidechains don't exist yet, you'd see some sort of substitute filling the need/demand for the feature. I myself thought the altcoins did this job.

@_date: 2014-04-10 17:05:05
Well, I think you now have a new problem: For most other useful applications, they will have little incentive to sidechain and deny themselves speculation profit because if they are, by definition useful, they have the same if not more incentive to float their coin value. Just because we don't like scamcoins abuse of the profit incentive doesn't mean that other useful applications shouldn't take advantage of it. I'm not sure of the value proposition for sidechains as we go down the rabbit hole.
@_date: 2014-04-12 21:33:28
A new idea and I might be wrong: Sidechains may actually encourage more bitcoin miners to enter and stay supporting Bitcoin. More security for bitcoin will mean more security for sidechains that need mergemining.
A large fee-generation opportunity from thousands of sidechains seeking mergemining security from bitcoin miners could generate new profits for the bitcoin mining pools and encourage more miners to enter, if the profits are sufficiently attractive. Miners can extract more rents from more mergemined-sidechains as well as compete for block rewards.

@_date: 2014-04-11 23:07:01
If we don't know the answer now, most likely the solution we are proposing adds no substantial value to the problem we want to solve: Encouraging Bitcoin core innovation at low risk to bitcoin core. 
Miners are profit-seeking. Rational miners will maximize profits by requiring that sidechains compete for mergemining hash capacity at the highest possible price. Rational devs seeking to maximize profits will seek out cheaper substitutes that are good enough to deliver relative to their investment costs and mergemining costs. Rational devs will also seek maximum profits, not pegged profits, unless they really want the peg limit on profits for a particular reason. Rational miners can't attack every altchain as there is no real profits in that activity unless they are also playing the pump and dump game, as well. 
Therefore, from the perspective of profit maximization, I don't yet see much evidence of strong incentives for miners to either attack altchains or for devs to take their best coin innnovation into sidechains. If I'm wrong, I'm glad to be educated and corrected.

"If you're a Bitcoin company and you open up a bank account and don't tell us, you have maybe 9 months before we shut you down. Most Bitcoin businesses can't stand up to our 3-month AML/KYC security audits anyway. And meh.

Sidechains are not the end of altcoins. In fact it seems that , sidechains will be just another way to create altcoins of many other flavors, but they will use BTC to fund the creation of coins on the new "chain". So, you can propose that .0004 BTC = 1,000,000 SIDECHAINCOIN at creation.

You forgot to include that Counterparty has ALL the security of the bitcoin blockchain as it's transactions on Counterparty are recorded there. 
Therefore, any contracts or assets built on the Counterparty protocol do not require developers to fight and compete to convince miners to mergemine their new coin. 
Also, all Counterparty transactions pay miner fees for their financial transactions to be included in the blockchain, just like everyone else. However, I digress. This thread is about Sidechains, not Counterparty.

Yes, these "atomic transactions" make sense to shuffle the bitcoins around, but how will that work? Will there be a maketplace for posting cross-chain exchange transactions to do this shuffling? How will we know which bitcoins should go into new sidechains to fill the growth in value? Who will build this functionality to enable this shuffling? Who will pay to enable and to maintain it? What will that cost?
Lastly, I don't understand the corporate bond analogy and the conceptualizing of flow patterns. Do corporate bonds allow for atomic transactions between them?

Meh. I think we doth protest maybe too much Professor?
Blockstream is a rockstar startup with $21MM in funding from leading Silicon Valley investors.
Blocktream's job is to convince the world (including you and me) that its Sidechains technology is *THE NEXT AWESOME THING IN BITCOIN* that will change the WORLD!
The Sidechains paper is not sponsored by a non-profit or university so it doesn't misrepresent itself, at least to me. Thus, I can feel okay that the Blockstream team is pursuing its corporate and fiduciary duty to promote this new technology and its view of the Bitcoin world. That's not evil. That's just business.
We don't have to agree with the Sidechains view of the world and we still have to see if we will ever use the product.
So, in the end, I don't think you're wrong, but I think a startup's gotta do what a startup's gotta do: Sell the dream!

My new hypothesis has 3 guesses: 
Guess  Creating "public good" type coins like Namecoin, Zerocoin, CharityCoin or similar tokens where speculative profits of the sidecoin are not critical to the developer would fit nicely into sidechains.
Guess  Experimental coins for testing new ideas won't require you to fork bitcoin or litecoin software. Just spend some bitcoins, create your sidechain and get to testing! You'll still need to create a blockchain somehow, but it might be easier than trying to create an entirely new coin. These coins may not require lots of security via mergemining.
Guess  Guaranteed security from minerpools willing to mergemine your coin. If a mining pool really likes you or the philosophy of your coin, you can convince them to mergemine your coin (subject to costs) and tout your security wins as a reason for the public to engage your coin. 
These are my 3 guesses, but assume I'm wrong as I'm trying to understand the alignment of incentives as well. I'm learning with you.

Yes, folks keep mentioning the fees to miners. How big will these fees need to be to justify miners making a selection to mergemine my sidechain? If sidechains are supposed to host 100s or 10,000s of altchains, I'm guessing that cost won't be cheap. My guess is that many sidechains will just eschew mergemining security entirely for some other alternative: An altcoin fork?

Luke. If a customer present an RBF payment, we can refuse to accept it. We have no intent to take payment and defraud customers. Also, you lack of legal understanding is telling. Fraud is only fraud if no consideration is given, not if payment is presented and rejected.
@_date: 2016-01-06 19:06:59
Thanks for the clarification. See, even I could use some education on the workings of RBF as a merchant processor!
Yes. We use BIP70 for all payments between customers and merchants.
as per comments [here]( we are going to be looking for the warning flag and not accepting those transactions, if we are able to freely inform our customers that we will not and provide them other options.  It is my understanding that Opt-in is a flag for the recipient and gives us a choice. Am I wrong here?
Luke, it should be our own choice to decline RBF-flagged transactions that don't align with our interests as merchants just as we can decline users who wish to pay with Visa or Mastercard.
There's no argument about whether we accept Bitcoin. We are proud to have more 50 - 70 year old customers using Bitcoin on our platform, daily than any other bitcoin company. However, our business interests is in maximizing revenues and limiting costs to conducting business. If RBF risks to increase our business costs, we will take action to minimize that risk and we will do it without losing any love or utility for Bitcoin.
Luke, I think you need to realize that as we continue to change Core, changes that are outside the interests of the merchants whom need Bitcoin software to function to stay profitably alive, will result in rejection or disuse of those features. 
This is straight up commercial software engineering and product management. I hope that helps and thank you for engaging with me.

I think he's trying to say that we're glossing over the security implications and not giving users an understanding of the choices available to them.
@_date: 2016-01-06 05:02:43
It simply means that we will not accept RBF-flagged transactions. Really, it's not even material to us because our wallets will not allow RBF since we already determine the fees for our customers.
Most regular "non-bitcoin-savvy" consumers have no idea what fee they should pay anyway and would prefer we just take that chalice of pain away from them.
I'm not sure how the accusation of fraud fits in your remaining premise or conclusion, but think I answered the first question. Yes?
@_date: 2016-01-05 20:53:25
I think the nature of the circumstance is a very low priority and perceived risk at this time. We just haven't lived it, Peter, so I agree it's possible, but relative to the other drama we're slogging through, we haven't given it much thought.
Our merchant processing requires that all our consumers use our hosted bitcoin wallets to pay our merchants using payment channel requests. 
Thus, we manage the fees for all txes in each merchant payment completed on our syste. Our risk/circumstance for low fee, double-spend attack, is pretty much zip. We're building follow-on transactions so complete fee control, per tx, is required for our business-case.
Did I address the point correctly?
@_date: 2016-01-05 18:22:59
Yes, we live in the real world too and 0-confs were never a problem for customers. 
However, 0-confs sit in the mempool. They are easily malleated transactions that can screw you up when the next bitcoin attack comes. Our bitcoin merchant problems are rarely ever customer or merchant related. 
It's the limitations or features of good old bitcoin software that cause the most pain.
@_date: 2016-01-05 20:07:31
Great question. We deal with thousands of consumers who use us as their primary wallet for merchant payments. Most of these consumers are no familiar with bitcoin so we are an end to end solution for both merchants and their consumers.
Within our wallet, not an issue as we control fees dynamically. As per low fees, we have yet to hear any of our consumers or merchants even have awareness of fees, their impact, and how to maximize so they are not stuck. Most of the users that come to us via other wallets, already come via Coinbase or Circle that manages fee issues quite well so it hasn't been a problem. 
It's our view that in the broader scope of bitcoin consumer adoption, low fees is not a problem that is killing growth. RBF is a great piece of engineering, Peter, but not a cancer cure for merchant bitcoin acceptance hurdles of which we struggle daily.
**EDIT: Our biggest cancer pain right now? Full blocks slowing down our magical ability to delivery bitcoin txes in each block and super fast. We are also watching our tx fee cost rises with a watchful eye. Not a problem today, but forces consideration of substitutes at a certain price.**
@_date: 2016-01-05 18:44:07
Thanks for the added awareness. As a bitcoin merchant processor, opt-in RBF or full RBF doesn't solve any real problems that our customers or merchants experience using bitcoin for payments, but we'll definitely be checking for that flag!
@_date: 2016-01-06 20:27:55


I won't argue rationality here. Rationality is not this debate, but the value proposition of RBF for bitcoin merchants. The debate is about a feature that merchants/consumers have not vocalized or expressed demand, but a protection against a problem that is not really a problem. 




Not yet, but there's no evidence that the feature is even wanted or needed. Again, I argue that this feature is being forced on users as a protection against double-spends that is not a problem today. If you have evidence of demand for this feature, I would gladly welcome it.
@_date: 2016-01-05 22:53:16
Agreed. I thought that was understood from my next sentence: "If you want your bitcoin business to scale with less risk, don't do it."
It's a risk tradeoff that becomes more expensive as you grow. 
@_date: 2016-01-05 18:27:33
Check the blog post above. The issue isn't customer or merchant fraud. The issue is malleability of 0-Conf txes. That's some scary and nasty stuff if you expect to scale your business on bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-01-05 20:10:06
Excellent catch and well said. 
Yes, we tracked via txid because we built new transactions on the prior 0-confs in the mempool. We lost this magical ability after the last malleated attack. However, it was a sobering view that there may be more undiscovered merchant risk in 0-confs transactions that are unknown unknowns. 
My advice is for growing/scaling bitcoin merchants for whom transaction risk is a real cost that hurts profits. Ain't nothing wrong with taking a 0-conf, but it's unsecure and could cause more risks down the road.
@_date: 2016-02-06 23:06:10
The Lightning Protocol is just software. It is not a Hawala network nor does it really appear to facilitate Hawala type transactions any differently than just on-chain bitcoin transactions. 
Hawala networks are powered by intermediaries, Hawaladar's, that agree to take / send payment on behalf of someone else, while settling up separately. Hawala networks are great for remittance networks where exchange rate prices are extremely high. 
Individuals who use (or intend to use) the protocol to conduct money service type businesses (say acting as a Hawaladar) will need to follow the laws of their respective jurisdictions, just like anyone using Bitcoin to facilitate exchange between say USD and BTC.
See FinCen write-up on [Hawala Network its role in Money Laundering via Remittance](

Also a cautionary tale for **ALL** US Based Bitcoin companies that are in the MSB/Money Transmission activity. 
If you exchange BTC for USD in USA and are not licensed at the state level, you can still be convicted of breaking federal law for conducting MSB business without a state license.
@_date: 2016-02-06 23:45:21
When in doubt, I always go back to the sauce:
These should apply for LN transactions as well.
**Users of Virtual Currency**
   A user who obtains convertible virtual currency and uses it to purchase real or virtual goods or services is not an MSB under FinCEN's regulations.8 Such activity, in and of itself, does not fit within the definition of "money transmission services" and therefore is not subject to FinCEN's registration, reporting, and recordkeeping regulations for MSBs.9
**Administrators and Exchangers of Virtual Currency**
   An administrator or exchanger that (1) accepts and transmits a convertible virtual currency or (2) buys or sells convertible virtual currency for any reason is a money transmitter under FinCEN's regulations, unless a limitation to or exemption from the definition applies to the person.10 FinCEN's regulations define the term "money transmitter" as a person that provides money transmission services, or any other person engaged in the transfer of funds. The term "money transmission services" means "the acceptance of currency, funds, or other value that substitutes for currency from one person and the transmission of currency, funds, or other value that substitutes for currency to another location or person by any means."11
   The definition of a money transmitter does not differentiate between real currencies and convertible virtual currencies. Accepting and transmitting anything of value that substitutes for currency makes a person a money transmitter under the regulations implementing the BSA.12 FinCEN has reviewed different activities involving virtual currency and has made determinations regarding the appropriate regulatory treatment of administrators and exchangers under three scenarios: brokers and dealers of e-currencies and e-precious metals; centralized convertible virtual currencies; and de-centralized convertible virtual currencies.
A final type of convertible virtual currency activity involves a de-centralized convertible virtual currency (1) that has no central repository and no single administrator, and (2) that persons may obtain by their own computing or manufacturing effort.
**c. De-Centralized Virtual Currencies**
A person that creates units of this convertible virtual currency and uses it to purchase real or virtual goods and services is a user of the convertible virtual currency and not subject to regulation as a money transmitter. By contrast, a person that creates units of convertible virtual currency and sells those units to another person for real currency or its equivalent is engaged in transmission to another location and is a money transmitter. In addition, a person is an exchanger and a money transmitter if the person accepts such de-centralized convertible virtual currency from one person and transmits it to another person as part of the acceptance and transfer of currency, funds, or other value that substitutes for currency.

This is a wake up call to every Bitcoin CEO reading this thread. WE are ALL at risk and we could be next.
If you can do one thing today, start a simple controls program for your company, run by your compliance team:
1. Digital Signatures on ALL employee emails with directives. No digital signature? No action. Encryption required for all transaction emails maybe?
2. Compliance team reviews all internal money movements over $5,000.00 between employees. Compliance is a bureaucracy, but if ever they were needed, it's in slowing down fraud incidents just like this one.
3. Use BitGo, Xapo, or Coinbase to lock up large balances of corporate funds and reduce employee/corporate risk of losing working capital.
I welcome other ideas, but the easiest way I see is to always slow down money moving inside your company. Thoughts?

Great questions I'll try to share my ideas, but I'm mostly guessing and mostly biased!
1. I agree with your feeling so I should clarify that when I use the term "industry" I am not inferring an appreciating price of bitcoin as part of that definition. In my view, the industry consists of the individuals pursuing competition with incumbent financial institutions. R3 is now a well-funded competitor who just validated a market opportunity that the incumbents had previously ignored.
2. Banks will continue to be banks and regulators will continue to regulate. Legacy systems will improve, but I think trying to move a herd of 22 banks to adopt a standard won't be swift. Remember Chip Cards in USA? Banks compete with each other so any bank that can compete outside the herd and win, will be looking for an edge. Also, as startups, we should now be pointing our investors to look at R3 as validation that a substantial market disruption opportunity exists.
3. Lastly, R3's innovation still comes mostly from Bitcoin. Tim wouldn't be writing his latest blog post without the bitcoin ecosystem's thriving innovation and evolution. Take away Bitcoin and R3 and the banks will be on their own. Again, innovation happens at the edges, not at the center of the herd so I'm not worried that the price of bitcoin will benefit in some way. And if Tim doesn't write about Bitcoin, what will he write about? &lt;/EVIL GRIN&gt;
Hope this was helpful, but corrections and further thoughts are welcomed!

Centralized services provide tools to offload risk, which should be the a key objective of any financial services company. However, I'm not sure what's the point of your statement. 
BitPay paid their insurance premiums to a centralized clearing house for pricing risk and they deserve to get their payout. For the rest of us that don't have the funds to pay insurance premiums and then the attorneys to fight our lawsuits, there's the centralized services I listed. I'm always open to other ideas if you have them to share.

To tha moon! I say we break $500 before Jan 1, 14
@_date: 2013-11-07 04:26:41
Thanks! Yep, I hope I get a chance to use them again with some of the awesome feedback here!

If Bitcoin wasn't [labeled money]( by a Federal judge in August, then I would say...barter your way to the moon. 
However, in the US, bitcoins are now considered money at the Federal and state level so any Localbitcoin trading in the US appears to be a money transmission activity. Thus, operating outside the law would appear to be a personal risk.
I'm not a lawyer nor am I giving legal advice, but I hope I was helpful.

Retweeted! Nice work!

"Market Capitalization" isn't the correct term since Bitcoin isn't an equity or a company. 
Rather, we should use "Total Value of Coins Outstanding" or something more appropriate to the value of the coins. see the following posts:

Yes. Transaction fees are an incentive for mining and their low cost an advantage for businesses. I missed that one.
@_date: 2013-11-07 03:10:30
Thanks! Yes. In 5 minutes, you're supposed to explain consensus and SHA-256!
@_date: 2013-11-07 08:07:02
Thanks and nice point about security and defense of the network. Will add to my list of talking points as well. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 04:01:09
It can definitely be done. I will store your example as a fine talking point about the process off mining and receiving bitcoins in a controlled and pre-determined rate. Let's hope I get asked again so I can drop the awesome example here. Thanks!
@_date: 2013-11-08 17:51:36
Thank you very much for the tip! I am appreciating bitcoin micro-transactions immensely now. This is great. Thank you!

Thanks for the paper Peter. Going to read it right now.

[gives us a really nice one from on the crash. "This would be pretty tragic if you could die from jumping out the window of your mom's basement. -"](
@_date: 2013-11-07 06:02:42
Agreed. Mining is a meaty topic. I'll take your notes as further talking points on which to bring forth the innovation it enables. This goes well beyond just currencies, as well. Great point.

Awesome! Just booked my hotel at the MGM Grand. PM me details and I'll check for you on arrival. I get there on 12/9
@_date: 2013-11-21 01:26:53
This is the correct answer to the question. I believe the other folks meant  well, but conflated Smart Contracts with volatility risks. It's still very risky to do contracts in BTC due to the deflationary volatility, today. Yes.

As a Fixed Income trader told me on Thursday. There's lots "faith" buying, then testing reversals with profit taking, then pushes ahead. This is a wild ride so just strap yourself in and aim for the moon. Trying to forecast the tops is futile.
@_date: 2013-11-07 05:37:16
Thank you. It was a first shot and hopefully I'll have others where I can do better. Never found out why I got bumped, but so I guess it was legit.

The problem is that most customers of porn want IMMEDIATE satisfaction. Setting up a bitcoin account is currently too slow for many adult entertainment providers that need to deliver "IMMEDIATE", cheap consumption and then upsells to the more expensive package subscriptions. Most bitcoin merchants also don't support the innovative upsell subscriptions on their BTC merchant platforms.
@_date: 2013-11-07 03:14:00
Yes, I should have used the term "network effect" that continues to grow with more awareness and more usage. Thank you! I'll make a note. Love the idea about puzzles as searching for needles and getting a prize for finding the needle and verifying the transaction. Thank you! Love it!

How's your experience with BTCChina vs. Any-Other-Exchange-Insert-Here?  Also, a Chinese account is not required to use their exchange?

I am currently working with adult content providers. Another big pain is that porn viewers don't like waiting. They want to "enjoy" their paid content immediately. Given the time it takes to setup a bitcoin account and then transfer from your bank account, using a credit-card is still faster.  As such, the porn industry high merchant fees are actually less of a pain if a user can pay within a few minutes to quickly get hooked on becoming a recurring customer.

Bitcoin business is myself and my co-founder who love bitcoins and want to make it work in broader transaction contexts.
Our mission is to boldly go and increase bitcoin use among merchants. To seek out new merchants and new markets with high credit-card risk. To help them migrate these merchants to bitcoin as a way to reduce merchant fees and open up markets that were previously very hard or impossible to access.

Great post twobitidiot. However, as long as the onramps to Bitcoin are limited by the US commercial banks' distaste of anything bitcoin (until there's sufficient regulatory clarity) I'm not sure what Circle has that Coinbase does not, by way of changing the rules of the game to actually deliver a win for consumers.
@_date: 2013-11-15 07:38:56
Not to be a pain, but the law is the law. Operating outside the law is a risk you take, but as long as you are aware of the consequences, it's your decision. So many folks are operating outside the law so our hope is that the law changes so that you can do your business safely. However, beware the law, particularly the State, Federal, and Tax laws.

I'm late, but this was very clear. Thanks and I'll be re-reading again
