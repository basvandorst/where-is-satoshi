Nothing is broken, it's just the statistical nature of solving blocks.  If a block is found on average once every 10 minutes, then a few times in 425,000 it's going to take significantly longer than that.  
The only problem that this will cause is a massive backup of transactions since every block is at the size limit.  But you have to be careful what you say about the block size limit around here.

The difference here, though, is that it is a fundamental property of one of the currencies that has been / is being exploited in the nature of the theft.  Someone could have chosen to keep their value in fiat because they were wary of the security risks associated with the exchange's Bitcoin storage.  Yes Bitfinex is the entity at fault here, but it's Bitcoin's irreversibility and decentralization that makes a massive hack like this possible.
For full disclosure, I have a small but significant amount of fiat on Bitfinex, so I'm obviously biased in the matter.  But I think this is an interesting and tough question to answer fairly, and probably something that websites should start explicitly stating in their TOS.
Also, is it out of the question that Bitfinex could absorb this over a couple of years?  If they're willing to invest in security now I bet they could retain half of their market share.

While you're technically correct, I think most of this board believes that these types of measures are more destructive than productive and necessitate their own prolongation. 
(I'm not 100% sure prolongation is a word, but auto-correct isn't auto-correcting so I'll roll the dice.)

This mentality is killing our economy as we speak.
