Eureka, it works! I registered, voted and withdrew the proceeds.

Disney has gotten really expensive, but my niece has a pass. When we were in LA, we told my daughter that her cousin was taking her on a prison tour so that she would learn to be good. She went crazy when she saw they were driving into Disney Land.

I don't mean to be picky but, while they are on pallets, I don't think that they are actually "wrapped".

That would explain the expression on his face in the photo.

That's aussieum! Now I have a new word I can test out with my client in Australia.  So could I say "I live across the river in Pennsylvania where the rate is lower"?

Go Dad! That is exactly what my daughter would do with those stickers.

I don't know my son's Reddit username so I will have to forward this by email

Makes sense now. I have been involved with graphics wraps for tour buses and cars. I can see how you could do that with a kiosk.

Julia Tourianski is wonderful. I could listen to her for hours.

I apologize if this comment comes across as uninformed but it seems like the IRS position could be viewed as neutral or positive, that is, if I have to accumulate some BTC for my business, I can book this as an expense. If BTC were cash, I would be stuck holding profits. Please explain the circumstances where this interpretation is negative for a small or medium sized USA based business. Serious replies only please.

"Rates" is that British for something?

Transactions are more efficient than they have ever been before and yet merchant fees keep climbing. The Visa MasterCard duopoly is designed to tax ordinary consumers and pay big banks.

Spoiler alert - this is not a list of who the top BTC hodlers are.

TIL there is a sub called where the farmers hang out. I don't know many farmers but I did work with a big operation in the tree fruit business. Their farms employ very few people and they are all very busy so they are not interested in selling their cherries and such in quantities smaller than a rail car.
That doesn't mean there isn't a niche for some other company to come along and make it worth their while to sell smaller lots direct for bitcoin.
Actually, I did work with another smaller scale farmer, again not cacao, and his main issue was cash flow. He was willing to sell at close to half price if he could get paid a year in advance.
Sorry for so much text without answering your question. Just trying to share what I know.
