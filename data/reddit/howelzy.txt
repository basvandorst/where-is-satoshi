Cheers, the ironic thing is... if they ever give me permission to search, that'll be the second time i've mined those damm coins! 
Was easier the first time! :)

I don't need to look at my twitter to know what Bitcoin is, i read the whitepaper... in 2009!
Sorry if a bunch of guys came in, changed the original tx structure and want to masquerade it as 'BitCoin'.
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:19:36
Single (and yes i know there isn't any Bitcoin address' with 7500 coins stored in it) 
So your next question is how are they in a single address? 
Lets just say it was more than 7500 :)
But please don't ask me to post the public address. I'd rather not have people drooling over it etc

Well they managed to recover 99% of data on board Space Shuttle Columbia... after it exploded, crashed through the atmosphere and landed in the ocean.
So its possible... :)

lol cheers
@_date: 2017-12-05 01:18:06
actually i haven't received a single penny for any 'interview'.
would be interested to see those photos you took with the drone...

@_date: 2017-12-05 01:23:59
you know about 1% of the story... so give it a rest.
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:46:38
Difficult yes, impossible no :)
Also, i do know the date the drive was thrown out, and you are correct that they have records that would help narrow the search area considerably.
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:44:49
I dont keep 'whoring myself in newspapers'... i've turned down many tv/radio opportunities. 
Reporters email me questions, i answer. Simple.
@_date: 2017-12-05 14:30:53
Yes accidentally... as mentioned in a reply to another comment in this thread, you guys know about 1% of the story with regards to how it happened, sequence of events etc.
I can handle all the name calling crap its water off a ducks back to me, but just know there are details and facts which you guys aren't aware of. And probably never will be because i don't want to share them with anyone.
And yes i support Bitcoin Cash, but lets not get into that here, might get banned ;)
One other thing, i've never had any money from news reporters for 'interviews' i've given them. The only reason i ever agreed to speak to the media in the first place was in order to promote Bitcoin and to potentially find some people who might be able to help recover the drive, both financially and professionally.

Hi :)
@_date: 2017-12-05 14:13:58
A couple of production studios have approached me about doing this, but until the local council (who own the land) give permission to search the landfill theres nothing to film or document :/
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:01:54
Cheers... but you probably wont like what i have to say :)

As mentioned above the site is huge and would be a nightmare in the dark, and even for $1 billion you wouldn't have a chance in the dark.
If it's going to be done it needs to be planned out and executed professionally.

lol, OG bitcoin miner from feb 2009 getting told to GTFO... only at r/bitcoin :)
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:37:50
Maybe because i don't want to share that information with you... Why should i show you MY bitcoin address? I don't want anything from YOU so why should i jump through hoops for you? Also i don't give a shit if you believe me or not tbh, because quite frankly it doesn't make a difference either way does it? Doesn't help me get them back if a random on reddit believes me or not.
and anyway, anyone who really wants to find the address and gorp over it can do so easily enough by looking at the blockchain so how about you jog on! 
@_date: 2017-12-05 14:46:27
Ok thanks, will do.
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:19:15
The coins are exactly where i left them :)
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:43:14
Correct, could only be done with the correct permits and authorisation from local council and environmental agencies.
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:09:59
not if i dig it up first :)
@_date: 2017-12-05 02:35:25
yeah thats me... 
Elaborate more on the story? I mined bitcoin in early 2009, the drive containing the private keys was accidentally thrown out in 2013. Local authority have never allow me to search for it.
Oh and it was more than 7500, but who's counting...
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:10:39
Local authority have never allowed me to search :/

Ghostbusters!!! 
Had to be done :)

I don't see SegWit listed...

Back in early 2014 i secured funding and put together a plan to look for the drive which would have included documenting the process for a national TV channel, raised a reasonable amount with decent terms which would have been enough to build specific filtering/sorting machines, pay staff costs, pay for relocation of ongoing operations and to 'convince' the local council. Unfortunately the director of operations at the landfill site wouldn't even take my phone call (i was told he didn't want to discuss it with me, end of), local councillors weren't exactly helpful and the local mayor is a symbolic figure only (as in no actual power to make it happen). Anyway as the price started to crash down $500/$400/$300 it become economically unviable to recover it and its been sat there ever since. In 2016 the powers that be around these ways decided to extend the local M4 motorway which when complete will cut straight through the landfill site lol, the motorway isn't actually built yet but work is due to start in spring 2018. Details can be found below for anyone interested... 
 (Black line is the new motorway)
@_date: 2017-05-28 10:37:51
i am :)
@_date: 2017-05-28 08:22:57
lol, actually i never started looking. The local authority would never allow me to look for it, 'health and safety'... shit happens!
 
@_date: 2017-05-28 13:45:07
Correct :)
@_date: 2017-05-28 13:38:26
