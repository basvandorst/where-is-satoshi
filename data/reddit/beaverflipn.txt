Don't invest what you can't loose.  Diversify over time. dollar cost averaging is a great way to get the best deals with least amount of stress, cause we can never have perfect timing.  Litecoin looks like to be breaking out though.

I follow a guy named Oscar on YouTube... FYI I do not follow futures and will not ever try.  I do own btc though... He said the cboe was 1 btc to 1 future.  CME was 5:1 so the profit and loss margin was much larger.

well...... i see your point but even if we are in the late stages of the F-flag to your graph we could easily see a the final stages or the blow off top or if we haven't seen the blow off top 16k. if history repeats we should see 4 big pull backs the a F-Flag then a blow off which we haven't seen. could come from going mainstream next month?
market growth and adoption rates are off the charts..... I'm betting on a short term trade and big money coming into play by Feb.  .... i'm in at theses levels.

I've been considering bitcoin for awhile. Although thought we would have a pull back after $6,000 and yes we did... short lived seems like its over bought here. wondering if the run up will all be a buy the rumor sell the fact like... XRP's last announcement.  any thoughts?
