If Lightning is the TCP/IP stack.. is it open source and free to use like iP?
I'm sure i read the creators get fees from transactions. Which will completely destroy this promising upgrade.
@_date: 2018-01-21 20:31:22
80 dollars a month for &gt;200gb for those who are wondering.
@_date: 2018-01-19 16:24:20
U can still send payments via lightning to a specific person/business. Or you can use a hub that has many channels already setup. It is your choice to go for the centralized method. Or not.
Bitcoin remains decentralized only

If you can buy satoshis from Bitstamp and send them to your wallet without touching the base chain it would be immense. 1000s of people sending satoshis without having to pay that "high fee" to get onto the network. Only settling to base when funds are very large.

Don't think anyone is against increasing the block size by a couple of meg. But it's the manner in which it's done. Segwit does not jeopardise the network as it doesnt require a hardfork. It's best to squeeze as much as we can out of the current block before we consider a hard fork.

Banks will not use XRP. They will make their own version. Or pair up with other banks to make one. They would never give any power to another party. Especially one that would dump 1billion xrp each month.

@_date: 2017-12-09 11:55:27
You get different receive/public addresses per transactions, so it does not really work if you received your coins in multiple transactions.

Have a read about submarine swaps, splice in/out. The new loop in/out too.
 Soon you will be able to send to LN adresses from LN or BTC and vice versa. Without closing channels.
Rebalance channels yourself. Not requiring you to ask for incoming liquidity. 
You have valid questions. Have a read up on the roadmap and just be patient.
@_date: 2018-10-02 23:15:04
So to run this with your own BTC full node and lightning node. You will need to pay for a plan that's 40 dollars a month minimum?

I tried this. Currently synching a full BTC node with LND...
For those wanting to try out lightning or just run a BTC node, this is a great method for just 8 dollars a month
1. Setup account and add credits at LundaNode.
2. Add the API details from LundaNode onto [
3. Wait to synch.

@_date: 2019-12-21 14:26:08
People moan about how long it will take to onboard people to the lightning network due to the 4tps onchain. But they don't realise in the future people will be buying and sending only lightning btc. Bitfinex is showing how this will be done. Not many people will run their own nodes and make their own channels, but this is ok for small instant purchases. If you require the full attributes of bitcoin then it can be used for a larger fee, longer wait times... You have both options open to you.
Bitcoin will have all its applications built on layers. Just like how the internet protocols are built. OSI layer. This is the only way to achieve scalability. Would you put millions of people in one broadcast domain using MAC addresses for sending and receiving packets??  
Edit: Added some more.
Remember when there was fears of IP address space running out... The guru's created VPNs, NATing and later IPv6.
Only fear i have with Lightning is as the nodes and paths increase to thousands maybe millions one day. How will the routing cope about learning the best route? Currently on the internet we create areas, basically grouping a bunch of nodes and summarising their paths at the gateway, this obviously has problems in a trustless network.

PoS (peice of shit) is basically a mechanism for making large holders more money. Most likely. Exchanges will stake some of your coins and make a tidy sum off it. 
Great thing about PoW is that it is external to the system. And has created a brand new industry. Anyone can join mining. More capital more likely of success. PoS requires a newcomer to purchase a lot of coins to have a chance. Zero competitive market.

Please read the Bitcoin Standard. Or Audiobook it. You will realise the value PoW has on Bitcoin

How will it consume 50% of Earth energy? Christ! You do know there is a point that will prevent more mining once the price plateaus... It will not be cost efficient to mine Bitcoin. E.g 1 BTC = 1 million. Energy cost = 1.1 million. Prices never moves more than 1% due to immense liquidity.

Any reason why altcoin shillers/bitcoin haters keep badgering on about how PoW is wasteful and their coin has a better version of security? Expending physical energy to secure and provide scarcity should be expensive and difficult.
Sometimes i think it's because they want their coin to 1000x, sometimes it's just because they hate bitcoin or they are stupid?

I hope some day a bitcoin + lightning node is a simple plug and play device like your router from the ISP.

Don't invest in bitcoin unless you are in it for 3-5 years.
