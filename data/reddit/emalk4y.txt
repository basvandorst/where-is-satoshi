Depends if he can hold on til then without losing his shirt. One would hope the other 25% of his "life savings" are readily accessible. Don't be daft - never invest what you can't afford to lose. That applies to bitcoin, other crypto, and any traditional stock. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:11:50
Apparently, lots of people. Just saw a thread on about a sob story of a guy who had 75% of his "life savings" in crypto. Stopped reading. That's his own damn fault.

Been mining in slush's pool for the last two years. Successfully have a balance of 14 BTC atm, all mined. I live in a student house where rent includes utilities (electricity, heating, etc) . My entire house did it last year with their midrange GPUs. I successfully mine at 400Mhash/s when needed. I haven't spent a penny on anything other than the initial setup.

I have my Bitcoin-QT wallet encrypted and I frequently back it up to Dropbox and a memory stick. Where/how do I use 2FA though?

So I play soccer with my friends as a hobby. Therefore it's not a sport, right?
Garry Kasparov and Magnus Carlsen are competitive grandmasters who play Chess for a living, much like Tiger Woods plays Golf competitively for a living. But noooo, chess must be a hobby because you said so.
Fuck off with your lack of logic. A Kin degree doesn't make you know everything.

But they have &gt; 80% of all BTC transactions. If they "lose" their position, who replaces them?
I don't use MtGox since I'm in Canada (Just made a CaVirtex account two days ago) and there's no lag there, looks like, but we also have hardly any transactions in comparison.
@_date: 2013-04-08 22:15:43
Thank you. I do frequent backups of my wallet (encrypted) to Dropbox and a memory stick, so that's not a problem. As the other posters in this thread (and you) have said, I'll back up and then install on top of my current installation after exiting.
Thank you!
@_date: 2013-03-22 18:49:07
You, sir are a dumbass. Anyone who's using/mining BTC likely built that desktop they're mining on, rather than having a pre built pile of crap. No bloatware/crap ware there. Next: official Bitcoin client with encryption enabled periodically backed up to a TrueCrypt archive. (last part isn't even necessary, long as the dat file is backed up someplace safe) Go ahead and try to steal that. 
@_date: 2013-03-19 17:57:05
What application do you use to mine LTC? Is it cross compatible with standard BTC miners, such as poclbm, guiminer? 
@_date: 2013-01-10 02:55:43
I built my main desktop rig a year and a half ago: i5-2500K and a Sapphire 6970. Overclocked it to 920/1400 originally for gaming, then realized I had access to one of the best mining cards around. I'm a university student living at a rented (shared) student house, and electricity is covered under rent (has been for the last three years in the different houses I've lived in), so I can leave this thing on whenever I want without worrying about paying for a costly electricity bill.
I mined occasionally last January to April (while in school), and came up to around 8 or 9 BTC, back when they were worth ~8 USD. I haven't done anything since then, and came back to [bitcoincharts]( to see the price had gone up to $13+ USD, but the block reward had halved. I said no matter, I'm back in school, and I've been mining away whenever I'm not using my GPU to game or do intensive work. I set it to allow 30fps to other processes at all times, so I can browse the web and watch videos comfortably.
I get about 410 MHash/s on my 6970, and I mine for [Slush's Pool]( using [GUIMiner]( over OpenCL.
I currently have about 12 BTC total from starting up again (includes my previous BTC). It's somewhat slow, particularly with the half block reward, but it's nice to get some more use out of my card, which still performs beautifully, and is quite a bit better than the 5850/5870 since I don't have to worry about cost vs benefit, thanks to unlimited electrical utilities.

Oh holy damn, that's awesome, particularly since you're 15! When you said student, I automatically assumed you meant college/university student, haha, as I don't know anyone under that age who even understands Bitcoin, let alone mines it the way you do. That's fantastic on your part!
And yeah, you explained perfectly. That's exactly what I wanted to ask about, thank you. :)

@_date: 2013-04-08 22:14:47
Ah no I'm familiar with the link, just moreso wanted to know "how" to install the update, as I was unsure what installing on top of a current installation would do. answered that part though, but thank you!
And yes, I'm somewhat familiar with the other wallets out there. I do personally prefer using Bitcoin-QT though. (having seen Armory and Electrum).
@_date: 2013-03-27 11:50:39
What competitor is there for Canadians? MtGox is shutting out North Americans from march 31, and cavirtex has super high fees, and coinbase is just garbage now, no?
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:31:33
CaVirtex in Canada seems fine too.
@_date: 2013-04-03 07:13:41
Sorry! by "rates" I meant the fees on Cavirtex, as they're much higher than those on mtgox. However yeah, I do follow CaVirtex's price for CAD and MTGox's for USD.
I'll give Cavirtex a shot then, thank you! It seems the most reliable at least for us Canadians.

Is 1-888-812-2525 the number you called? I found the toll-free number from their [contact]( page. I tried calling them a few minutes ago regarding a question about verification and it went to voicemail. Not sure if it's the correct number.
@_date: 2013-04-02 18:25:51
Any more? Those rates are astoundingly high compared to MtGox. I'm in Canada too and wondering what else there is out there.

You're an idiot. OP asked for input and constructive criticism ("don't be too harsh") and that's what he's giving her. It Is a good video but it CAN be improved. That's always the case.

Well it used to be 100mb per file when they launched, so that's already a major improvement. Did not realize they'd upped to 4gb. Nice!

What does yours consist of, if I could ask?
@_date: 2013-03-19 07:04:54
I'm wondering, what would "initial investment" be considered if one acquired all their bitcoins through mining via a non-dedicated miner? (e.g. a gaming rig running a high end AMD GPU such as my 6970). It wasn't initially *built* for BTC mining, but I've got myself a solid amount of BTC from over the past few months.
@_date: 2013-04-11 02:27:43

But according to the media, it's super volatile because the biggest exchange (MtGox is such a joke) fucked up, therefore Bitcoin's future is at risk!
Think of it from someone just trying to get into it. MtGox is playing the biggest part in ruining that. Typical "Too much power? Let's use it for short term gains" mentality of theirs. Disgusting.
@_date: 2013-04-08 22:13:15
Ah, did not realize it was just a re-install on top of the old one. I assume my wallet would be untouched? (It's already encrypted and I back it up frequently to Dropbox and a memory stick)

@_date: 2013-03-01 19:25:42
Ah sorry for the vagueness. I was curious about your farm, as you put it in "quotes" haha. You answered it, thank you.
That makes me wonder, are you simply running multiple desktop workers with assortment of 5830s and the other two cards in there? Or do you have a workstation set up somehow? I ask because I've been meaning to do something like this for a while, as I'm also a student (student house, utilities included in rent, no need to worry about electrical costs, etc) and I've only got my main 6970 in my desktop. So, wondering what your setup looks like/consists of. Any more details/pictures would be awesome!

Unfortunately, Google Wallet is still not widespread outside of the US. In Canada, it's not even a valid form of purchases for most physical goods, and we can't even install the app on our phones without workarounds. :/
So I'd say Amazon is the prime choice here if they've been following this debacle.
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:25:31
I mean we wouldn't know. We don't have math degrees. It's just speculation man.
@_date: 2013-04-11 06:57:41
Yep, I remember that! I had just started mining when it was at $11, slowly up to $30, then down to $3. "Nope, there's no future, just sell and move on with your lives."
And you're absolutely correct. Here's hoping people actually learn their lesson this time and switch to other exchanges.
@_date: 2013-10-25 06:41:55
Perfect explanation, thank you :)
@_date: 2013-08-22 21:03:10
Hm, well when I ordered, BTC was worth $102/105 USD (~$110 CAD?) meaning I would've "spent" close to $700 CAD (6.6 BTC = $660 USD = ~&lt;$700 CAD)
That's initially what I thought too, but I'm in Ontario, and our HST is 13%, so $50.28 seems like an odd amount for that. Unless Canada Customs is only GST? (meaning 7%, which comes up to $49-50)

I have never spent a penny on BTC (not yet, anyway). Been mining faithfully for the last year and a half at 400 Mhash/s with utilities paid for. Now that it's finally starting to become too much effort, I was considering selling, but decided to wait out the storm. Woke up the next morning, saw its value had plummeted by 50%, shrugged and went on with my day.
If it drops to $2, I lose nothing. If it goes up to an obscene value, I gain ... well, obscene value * amount of BTC I have.
In it for the long haul.
