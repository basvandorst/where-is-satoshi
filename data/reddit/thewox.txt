Unless they have shorted the stock. Then they have an enormous incentive.

Most expensive car you'll ever buy.. :)
@_date: 2017-08-19 10:01:23
Can anyone ELI5 what this all means? I just wanted to buy BTC.
@_date: 2019-06-13 06:26:12
Random says "Bitcoin is the only option we have."
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:27:24
It'll dip a around 9k, he can buy some then.

Less bumpy? Dude if you are looking to buy the eth and you think btc is bumpy, get ready.
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:17:00
This man is playing fucking 5d chess folks.
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:41:48
I don't want to be a dick either but I am sure jfarbs did some of the googling before posting this important information. I trust his wit.
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:12:38
You could always sell it for that sweet BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-03 19:01:04
Level 9000 is coming.

You sir are a poet and a scholar. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 21:08:07
This guy knows things no one else in crypto has ever thought of.
@_date: 2019-04-08 14:12:17
Wouldn't it be hilarious if they put that exact quote of yours on your gravestone or urn one day?
user 0d35dee:
"its important for the weak to expire, this is the only way we can move the species forward."
@_date: 2019-04-08 12:58:54
How about basic human fallibility? 
@_date: 2019-04-09 01:43:30
The irony was too great not to.
@_date: 2019-04-25 11:27:18
You will be thankful one day.
@_date: 2019-04-08 14:13:49
Sorry dear you say "decentralized"?
@_date: 2017-04-01 07:09:56
I have given up, and I pray my coins will be worth something one day basically. 
@_date: 2017-09-17 20:13:20
Fees tho
@_date: 2017-09-17 20:06:05
The fees are going to be an issue for some..
@_date: 2017-09-30 16:29:34
@_date: 2017-09-19 19:33:27
Dude it's not worth it. Many don't get it.
@_date: 2017-10-15 06:27:14
I had something very similar with Litecoin, it just would not send. Eventually I was able to shapeshift it into dash and then it sent. Still beware of Jaxx.

Get his phone.

Five hundred million? Pah, this was only the beginning. Zimbabwe were printing trillion denomination notes!
@_date: 2017-10-11 22:06:05
Also the decimal placing is just terrible. Tech like Iota is coming and may be a real contender one day for day to day stuff and BTC might become a dinosaur.

Coffin, meet Jeff.

TBH I don't understand how much flak Vorhees gets. He has always been very balanced in his opinions and reasoning in interviews and has done a huge amount of work to support and strengthen the crypto ecosystem. 
@_date: 2017-07-04 22:43:59
Please excuse my ignorance I'm a bit of a pleb. Your hypothetical scenario with one coffee sounds challenging, but realistically how will BTC achieve scaling to instantly cover all transactions?
@_date: 2017-07-26 20:43:28
THIS IS DOG
@_date: 2016-07-03 07:16:05
Can someone just explain what this actually means for us normal people?
