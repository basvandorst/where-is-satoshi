How can I receive this change? How do I tell Mycelium to send the change back to me?

As long as you export it to a flash drive, you'll be able to do that

Use Circle, they have no fees for selling Bitcoin and pay top-dollar (currently 1btc sells for $388.14). You won't be able to find a better deal ANYWHERE.
It's also instant free withdrawal to your Star or Plus™ Visa or Mastercard (check the back of your debit card, most Wells Fargo and Chase banks have it, it looks like this (bottom right of card): 
(and no I'm not a rep for Circle)

This site requires you to be 13 or older to buy Bitcoin using a checking account: 
~~The fees on that site are very high though. I suggest using Coinbase and lying about your age.~~
Update: I lied, turns out Bitquick's fees are lower.

Use a debit Visa/Mastercard or a bank account, not a credit card, then they won't:

But so is the selling price, so you can buy Bitcoin from other exchanges, transfer them to Circle, sell them at Circle for a profit, and cash out.  
Unfortunately I couldn't find a way to do this because other exchanges, such as Coinbase, don't allow instant Bitcoin purchases, you have to wait at least 3 days for the Bitcoin to come into your account, and by that time the price of Bitcoin will change, while on Circle, it's instant
Or you can simply use Circle as a day-trading platform with no fees.
However, I can sell all the current Bitcoin I have for Circles asking price (which is higher then at Coinbase) and cash out.
So... I ask the question again, how does Circle make a profit?

What do you mean?

I'm sorry, old thread. Didn't realize you edited. To get a wallet address you can simply download a wallet to your computer (you can be any age for this):

Aww sweet. Your using the app right? It's not working on Android but I have my old IPod Touch. I'll try installing the app.
@_date: 2016-01-12 20:07:55
Can you login though? When I try logging in I get "Error 500 Apache Server down"
@_date: 2017-01-06 03:50:42
Coinbase is down too - cant login
@_date: 2017-01-06 04:00:40
My guess is they are trying to prevent people from selling Bitcoin during a crash, which (I guess) is a good thing, BTC-e is down too.
@_date: 2016-11-04 08:59:02
Awesome, thanks
@_date: 2015-03-02 09:13:48
For my own safety I suppose

They do tell you were the card is from: 
"Cards are issued by Bank Zachodni in Poland, not by us. "

As scheduled, the US Marshall sent the Bitcoin from seized Silk Road assets today.

I didn't, here is the proof: All of the recent bets show the transaction ID. If you click on the transaction ID, it goes to Blockchain with the information about the transaction.

My question is "if they will still be worth anything"
@_date: 2015-03-15 21:39:27
How do you explain this then: 
@_date: 2015-02-14 20:54:52
Yup, if you want to change that place a bet for 0.001BTC lol
@_date: 2015-02-14 20:58:42
No, it's all in the rules. A gambler send funds to the Bitcoin address they want to bet on, and if they win, the funds instantly get returned to the Bitcoin address they were sent from. So you don't need an account for this. One of the cool features of my site.

That's what I'm trying to find out, I need suggestions for my future plans. Right now I'm just trying to gain users so I am setting the payout/chance ratio equal.

This has nothing to do with the discussion

Reminds me of my site: Luckybit.net 
@_date: 2015-02-27 21:22:00
Are you saying my post is wrong and there is no way to track transactions by going to Blockchain?
@_date: 2015-02-14 19:58:32
It's in the rules. The Bitcoins get sent back to the address they were sent from. But thanks for the suggestion.
