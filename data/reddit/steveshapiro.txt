That means you can't do anything about tumbling without outright making crypto illegal

Nowadays it sounds a lit bit crazy to see migration of populations to BTC country, but if there will be a country with bitcoin as currency it would attract bitcoin "adventurers" from all over the world.

Just a pair of underpants? maybe that one were made from gold or silver? That can describe his buy

I am not suprise that he denies being Nakamato! But that doesn't tell anything cause there is two possibilities:
1) He is true Satoshi and so he is lying cause he doesn't want a high interest from publicity
2) he is not Satoshi and is telling the thruth

I like him and his videos about Apple.
Actually, we are "the starry-eyed dreamer who sees the ideals in all of this." That's why we like bitcoin and I m sure he was not the only one to start questioning

Surprised there was an interview with Mark Karpeles. The interview gave a hope of getting bitcoin back and lots of new questions.

Well! That make sense why they drops to 7th place. Another reason maybe it's because of the situation with their national currency?

Need to prove - otherwise it seems to be a commercial for PayPal. Can you show the video and the blockchain? 
@_date: 2014-03-07 14:03:36
OMG! Maybe they used the news about Satoshi to make these scam? or even they started this rumor

Arthur Nakamoto, thank you for sharing it with us. As for me, I am far from believe mass media expecially Newsweek. Reporters have a general lack of respect and they may use any information to make their newspaper more popular.
