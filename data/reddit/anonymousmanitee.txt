But in large amounts? I.e. 100k and up.

Genuinely curious - but how liquid are your crypto assets?

I know this is of no help now, but consider buying with a credit card (or debit card not linked to any main account) in the future. While there are daily limits, it’s usually faster (and safer) to make multiple purchases over a few days, rather than relying on a single huge wire transfer to come through in time. Also, the fees seem steep but they really are nothing... 10% or whatever it is is peanuts in cryptoland... Just my 2c... I’ve too have experienced wire transfer anxieties (the whole range of emotions - from anger, to self pity, to apathy, to rationalisation lol) and don’t wish it upon anyone... Hope you get your funds sorted man.

Mmm no no no

Nice try but you can tell some of it went over their heads, especially the hash rate one lol

Ideally you should keep your crypto PC pretty clean. But in this case I might suggest moving your coins to an exchange with 2FA...  even then leaving coins on exchanges isn’t a great idea, but at least the 2FA will be harder to break if they do glean your usernames/passwords. Idk man, for me anything dodgy goes on a different machine.

So you say what your problem isn’t, but you never say what it is (other than that you don’t understand - whatever that means). Dafuq dude, what’s your point?

...8 cents??? Gotta learn to weather the dips sooner or later

You might be able to wire transfer to an exchange that doesn’t require verification but your bank might ask wtf you’re doing. Idk tho, everything I go through has required at least some form of verification where fiat is involved. It’s probably that few of us are under 18 so we don’t really know ;) above all, stay safe, be careful with your debit card and don’t get scammed :)

Sure thing
