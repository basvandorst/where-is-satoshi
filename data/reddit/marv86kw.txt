Well, that's great and all, but I really don't know much about what alternatives I have to trade btc easily. Can you point me to who I should be dealing with?

Just opened an account Sunday with etoro and dumped 2k in it. Waiting ot verify to up total to about 10k. Will be an 7% exposure.
Fomo is real here... Btc was $10.9k and today its effin $12k..
God help us.

I'm not sure I follow. As I understood it, etoro has a cryptoexchange and what I'm buying is the actual underlying coin. 
Do you mean its a derivative indexed product? I specifically asked if it was a synthetic pricing mechanism and they said no, that its possible to transfer my coins to an external wallet. 
Would appreciate if you could clarify what you mean, and how to go about buying real bitcoin vs what you're saying is a "bet"?

Well, what if it is?
And if i withdraw where do I put it? I don't want to deal with complicated wallet mgmt.
Any good exchanges or brokers?

Can you expand on split the investment? Didn't get what you mean.

Hello. I just got off the phone with the CS rep. He mentions wire transfer purchases will let you own btc in a client wallet where you can transfer them out. For CC funding they allocate your btc in a subwallet in a for clients, whee they will transfer it out to you iphone request.
I asked about them not doing coin xfere, he says yes that used to be the case but now they have the wallet and exchnage etc so they can do all that stuff.
I'm primarily interested in trading btc,, going in for a ride on this and seeing where it goes for a few months. My concern is being able to sell the btc and withdraw the greenbacks.

Who said anything about day trading? I'm allocating 5% of my portfolio to btc with some entry exit conditions, its tactical allocation for momentum. I'm long term bro.
I'll look into this coinbase and others. Thanks for the tip.
Of those mentioned, any difference between them?
