If I still have Bitcoin there, wasn't there some form we have to fill out to get the money back if it ever does?

Thanks, that was exactly what I was looking for.

Can you ELI5 this? I just added some money to Mt. Gox last night (haven't purchased anything yet). What's the process once I make a BTC purchase? How do I store them locally vs. on Mt. Gox?

40 second lag now, down to $93.12

Well Mt. Gox is re-opening at 10PM EDT, so 9 for you

If you can get this one to load, it updates fairly quickly:

Managed to load after six minutes. Down to $98

Agreed; I used Bitinstant to get money into Mt.Gox quickly this afternoon before the crash and I took my cash to a local store, they did the moneygram, and when I got home it was in my Mt. Gox account. Not bad.

You're basically asking someone to give you anywhere from $60 to $120 depending on what minute it is tonight. Read up on the FAQs and then try a small investment once your funds clear. You don't need to buy an entire coin, you could buy, say, $10 worth.

I think he's saying that he uses the randomized generated password feature of KeePass. I haven't used it, but I think it will generate a password, then save and auto-enter it for you so you never have to "know it."

Also, from what it looks like initially, your forms aren't protected with CSRF tokens.

It's still up; instant drop from 102 to 95.
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:11:25
It dropped to $76 now it's bee-lining for $90 again.

Easiest thing I did was take $203.95 to a local CVS. They MoneyGram'd it to ZipZap (the $3.95 fee) and then ZipZap gave it to Bitinstant (the site that coordinated all this). When setting up the deposit, Bitinstant allows you to specify the Mt. Gox account. You incur a 3.5% fee through Bitinstant, but it really is the quickest way I've found if you want money in an hour or less.

I put in $20 so far tonight and have watched it go up and down like a slinky. It's oddly addicting, but I'd never put in anything I couldn't live without.

Where can you find the lag time?
EDIT: Nevermind, saw it on this page:

Sent you guys an email, but using "Secure" and "HTTPOnly" flags for your cookies would be advisable.

When it came back up at 2AM UTC there was a little bit of movement before they opened the floodgates. Perhaps that's what they're doing here, who knows?
