“Uh yeah man. This piece of paper the government just printed is worth 5 chickens. It’ll probably end up being worth more later. Trust me.”
Regardless of the context, the way you delivered your point could make anything seem sketchy and cause people to be skeptical. 
The problem/hurdle to overcome with adoption of cryptocurrencies is how stupid the general populous is. They look to the banks to fix their fuck-ups as opposed to taking responsibility for their own actions (looking at you people who enter their credit card credentials without concern for fraud occurring because they can just pester the bank until they get their $ back) and so long as they have someone to blame and scream at, that is the method of commerce they will prefer to use. No one even bothers to think about our monetary system, how it works, and how broken it is. But it’s all they know and are comfortable with it, therefore they are resistant to change. A vast majority of the world seems to be comfortable with the current system in place and unless you can explain to individuals how it benefits them financially they couldn’t care less. I truly believe it will take another depression for people to even consider using cryptos as a form of p2p cash beyond us early adopters
