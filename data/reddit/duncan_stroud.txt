I found a piece of code that does the trick... (from here 
    var HDKey = require('hdkey') 
    var cs = require('coinstring') 
    var seed = process.argv[2]; // arg[2] is your base64 key i.e.    '0C28FCA386C7A227600B2FE50B7CAE11EC86D3BF1FBE471BE89827E19D72AA1D'
    var hdkey = HDKey.fromMasterSeed(new Buffer(seed, 'base64')) 
    var hex = hdkey.privateKey 
    var version = 0x80; 
    //Bitcoin private key 
    console.log(cs.encode(hex, version)) 
~&gt; npm install coinstring hdkey
~&gt; node ./keyconv.js 0C28FCA386C7A227600B2FE50B7CAE11EC86D3BF1FBE471BE89827E19D72AA1D

Thanks! checking it out now

Correction:  The js code does not match the output from  :(
However, this python code does (from the same link)
    import binascii
    import hashlib
    import sys
    def privateKey_to_WIF(pk):  import format ==&gt; pra importar nas carteiras
        privWIF1 = hashlib.sha256(binascii.unhexlify('80' + pk)).hexdigest()
        privWIF2 = hashlib.sha256(binascii.unhexlify(privWIF1)).hexdigest()
        privWIF3 = '80' + pk + privWIF2[:8]
        pubnum = int(privWIF3, 16)
        pubnumlist = []
        while pubnum != 0: pubnumlist.append(pubnum % 58); pubnum /= 58
        WIF = ''
        for l in ['123456789ABCDEFGHJKLMNPQRSTUVWXYZabcdefghijkmnopqrstuvwxyz'[x] for x in pubnumlist]:
            WIF = l + WIF
        
        return WIF
    
    k = sys.argv[1]
    rs =  privateKey_to_WIF(k)
    print(rs)

yes, I know, like I mentioned in my post... but I need to convert hundreds, thousands from 65 to WIF.  Any ideas how?  Is there a utility, library, algo, etc?  I have been looking, but not found anything yet.

I did as well, but it seems that unless you were previously among the "chosen", we have to just wait until this testing phase is over before you get access to the bitcoin feature?

The questions has to do with apparent ease in which my 2FA security was breached more than my loss of bitcoins.  hitBTC does not control my gmail account or my 2FA authenticator. And the question was "how is this possible?", not "should I keep my coins in a service".  Should I stop using email as well and only use snail mail?  Should I stop using online banks and only use brick and mortar banks?  Should I stop shopping on Amazon and only go to the local K-Mart?  It's a security question, not a bitcoin question... which you might have gleened if you had read past the second sentence.

Sooo... for the rest of the "unchosen", we have to just wait until this testing phase is over before we get access to this feature?

The same happened to me last night on my hitBTC account.  I need 3 unique 2FA passwords to withdraw coins, and yet, someone managed to get in anyway (and I do not use SMS 2FA)... and I got the same lame "you were probably on a phishing site" response.
Clearly, there is a way to hack 2FA that is not being talked about.  
@_date: 2017-11-28 01:44:46
How about the question "How can I do online bitcoin trading without losing my bitcoins, even if I use 2FA at every access point?"  Is that bitcoiny enough?  Nevermind, I will take this to another forum... as clearly this is of no interest to crypto-traders. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 02:59:24
Agreed.  I lost 100 coins on blockchain.info, and one of their supposedly top tech guys, after digging around, even admitted it was very "odd", "unexplainable".

I have that.  The money online was specifically used for trading.  Until someone develops a trading app that runs as a local client against your own wallet, this is an issue that will continue to plague many.  I am  trying to find out how to improve security, for myself, and for others who have suffered the same fate, of which there are many, I can see (specifically, mysteriously compromised 2FA)
