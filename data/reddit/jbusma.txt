Atleast with dark wallet here's how it goes.
Send to stealth address, look for tx on blockchain, see where funds were sent, get balance.
It's like adding a step, but by no means secure.
As far as utility it's like a restricted public key, which is better, but you can still see where funds went.
@_date: 2014-08-30 18:07:55
hmm. Good point. But if they proved they owned an address one month ago, and we can still see the balance, doesn't that prove they still have the reserves, assuming it all adds up?
@_date: 2014-07-01 19:04:06
I almost agree...almost.
If the loan is in fiat, and btc simply used as a means of payment, then the means used to transfer the funds are really irrelevant.
1 individual with 333.33 btc will probably not loan it out at mortgage interest rates. They would rather hold it, if they think the yield will be better than the interest.
However, when you ignore the difference in investments, and simply see the btc as an instrument of payment, now you can get 200k people around the globe to loan you a dollar, and suddenly you have a house.
The point of btc lending is not to offer a better ROI than holding, its about letting a large number of investors contribute easily to one larger goal.

Examine the information they gather!
They got social, phone number, email, address, cc info, and banking info in one central location.
They will be kept afloat by the NSA as they use this to create a digital map of sorts in an attempt to de-anonymize the blockchain.
Users that receive funds directly from circle members, but don't use the service will still be at risk because if they have enough of your friends mapped out, they can use the blockchain to analyze your history by extension.
This becomes exponentially difficult the more degrees of seperation you have between yourself and circle.
Think like....facebook, but instead of gathering everyone's identity, they will have complete access to everyone's financial activites.

Ok, props to you guys for running what could be one of the best exchanges so far.
HOWEVER, your proof of reserves shows nothing. It'd be really easy to run a script to check for a bunch of addresses that add up to what your reserve is and post the public keys.
To truly verify the reserves, and present a first of its kind, real time audit, You also need to post a signed message from each address so that individuals may verify ownership.
Otherwise, looking at this from a true skeptic's point of veiw, you're just listing a bunch of addresses that I have no idea if you own or not.
@_date: 2014-10-23 03:00:24

And yes, bitcoin buying shouldn't be a crime, bitcoiners are not criminals. But helping launder money from stolen credit cards is a crime. And not even a victimless crime, like selling drugs of pirating movies.
I'm all for civil disobedience, but this guy is ALLEDGED to have thought he was helping launder stolen money. And that crime has several victims.

@_date: 2014-05-09 14:09:52


Ok go on...


@_date: 2014-09-10 17:46:45
Let's do some math children!
Assuming a stable price of $500, and an approximate rate of 3600 fresh coins per day, at a rate of 10 minutes per block and 25 BTC per block, this means that if the price doesn't change there was a demand for $1.8 MILLION worth of coins that day.
Now exchanges are not perfect, and the numbers don't unfold exactly that way because the price moves, but it's a damn good estimate.
So if there is $1.8m daily demand, and the daily production drops to half, 1800 coins per day, What needs to happen?
I leave this open for discussion.
@_date: 2014-10-22 10:24:04
People also need to come to terms with the fact that we admit the blockchain is vulnerable, the venue for it just isn't financially practical (51%).
While I agree with AA on the fact that a 51 wouldn't kill bitcoin, I sure as hell wouldn't want to be holding when it happened.
I think an elegant way to put it is as follows: With hacking a centralized service, hackers are incentivized by MILLIONS of people's credit card information, potentially worth hundreds of dollars per person.
If someone wants to do the same with your bitcoin, assuming a local client is used, they have to execute an attack with only your puny life savings as their reward.
As far as altering the blockchain, it's the difference between getting unauth access to one server, and literally every node in existence.
@_date: 2014-09-29 21:57:26
If you're not long term holding, sell now.

And no bitcoin institution is reporting random tx so...
@_date: 2014-11-30 20:38:50
I've sead it before, and I'll say it again. All this means is that they controlled the addresses at one point in time, and are using the same sig over and over
Unless they sign the most recent block hash (equivalent of a newspaper in a ransom photo) There is no proof, just a good likelihood that those addresses are still under their control in the present.
@_date: 2014-11-30 19:50:59
To verify balance, yes.
But private/public crypto works like this:
To prove you have ownership of a public key/address without revealing the private, you take a message, and sign it with private key. The signature is then independently verified using the public component.
No message, no verification. Ideally they would use the latest blockhash to establish real-time solvency.

When will consider giving full, real-time proof of reserves using public keys of cold storage, and digital signatures such as Coinport.com does?
This is great news, but now we have to trust Stefan, when we would all prefer to be able to do the audit ourselves.
Looking at the source code, it appears that not even Stefan verified ownership of the addresses!
They just gave him a bunch of public keys that might, or might not, belong to them.
So not only are we trusting Stefan to verify that the user balances mathces the addresses listed...
We are also trusting Stefan is also trusting OKCoin that all the public key's they claim to hold are really theres, without proof.
This is great work, but it has a long way to go.
@_date: 2014-09-19 01:00:02
But here's why that's wrong.
1. The algorithm you deem wasteful, and expensive makes it that much more difficult to uproot the network. If the algorithm was easy to solve, and didn't require special hardware, what would prevent people from "solving" their own blocks and spamming/relaying via false nodes.
2. As long as no one achieves 51% of network hash rate, it's relatively easy to assume, and not that hard to prove that pools are not colluding with malicious intent.
3. Verification isn't instant for any sort of payment we have, except cash. Credit cards can be reversed up to 6 months down the line. Double spending requires massive technical knowledge and luck to pull off. Not really worth it for a $4 cup of coffee, and why not make them wait 10 minutes before driving off in a corvette?
4. This is where you really start to lose rationality. Miners costs (electricity, hardware) are RELATIVELY constant, if there are less coins being produced does it makes more sense for the price to rise to match the lessened supply, or tx fees to go up?
5. Assuming the network is online, otherwise why even address the issue of longevity, and you hold your private key, your coins will exist for eternity.

If a wallet is deterministic, there is no need to keep a wallet.dat file server side, yet alone encrypt it.

However, using the transparency of the blockchain, hopefully users will be able see their deposited funds go from the deposit address, to the listed hotwallet address, to the cold storage address eventually.

Electrum generates all your keys from a 12 word seed with 128 bits of pure entropy. It uses trusted servers to check the balance of the PUBLIC addresses, and gets the information that way.
No one but the knower of the seed will ever see the private keys.

All strawmen aside, I'm not going to claim that hacking is a myth, or impossible. Part of what turns people off to bitcoin is you have know all this "computer stuff": booting from a CD, offline key generation, encyrption.
I'm just trying to collect some anecdotal evidence as to whether or not this has actually been a huge problem for people, not if it will be.

It's open source, and JS is executed client side.
bitaddress is "good enough" I'd think it'd be more likely someone with network access intercepts the privkey when you send it to the printer than from your browser, but what do I know.

I think the best case scenario is this. You purchase with US bank wire, for no fee, then send bit coins to your aunt in Nepal, then she sells them to circle (2.9% fee) to her debit card. Or she sells them via local BTC/LBC.
This is infrastructure, it's very pleasant.

Well it's like this:
If you restore your wallet from seed every time, then why take the chance, albeit very small, that their server might be compromised and your passphrase guessed?
Your seed is all you need, and trusting it to an online service, even when the work is done client side feels iffy.

Why are poeple recommending paper wallets?
OP, paper wallets are great if you're HODLing for the moon, laminate it in your safety deposit box, and sit tight.
If this is just spending money, or you're just protecting yourself from insolvency, then you need a local wallet Bitcoin-QT. As long as your passphrase is a bit better than password123, you'll be fine.
If you're extra paranoid, boot up some fresh linux and put it there.
@_date: 2014-08-26 18:07:40
Absolutely nothing. Bitcoin uses SHA256
@_date: 2014-08-14 20:27:05
This would be as simple as making the post message:
"We currently have x.xx BTC in port!" (clever right? just chance for NXT/DOG/whatever)
Then at the end of each day/hour have post of list of the signatures in json format, and they can be easily checked via a forloop (distributed in python on github so anyone could verify).
You may even consider a small bounty (1 mbtc?) for having users post their calculated proof of solvency on social media.
All food for thought :)
@_date: 2015-01-03 20:13:22
I'd argue there is nothing brave about this at all.
The point is to show non tech-savvy people that bitcoin isn't stolen because it's inherently insecure or poorly coded, but rather idiots have bad security.

Yo bithernet, I'm happy for ya, and Ima let you finish...
But if the api is access via BitID, which is just crypto signatures...
What keys are signing? Because if its the same hot wallet keys, then guess what, you still only need the hotwallet keys to be compromised to drain the wallet.
A better solution might be to have the second signing pair on your phone, with the first on your computer?

Murderous drug lords are much easier to prosecute.
Also, darkmarkets take business away from the cartels, and do infact reduce violence.

@_date: 2015-01-29 15:59:28
So are the private keys stored on the wallet or the phone?
If the privkeys are on the card, is the transaction transmitted to the card via nfc? And then signed locally and sent back the same way?
Also, if the keys are generated on the wallet, how do they get there?
Perhaps use accelerometer for proper randomness, and then display 128-bit seed at a time for recovery purposes?

This is inherently insecure. Now you're back to one seed compromised and poof. This literally undoes all the work of multisig.
@_date: 2015-01-19 16:40:35
With every wallet I have encountered, all that is needed to veiw the seed is password entry. That means that the same typical means (keylogger) used to bypass encryption also renders single-seed wallets vulnerable. Even if your wallet was special and unique, and would never show seed, Master Priv Key still needs to be held and encrypted locally.
It's not about entropy, its about the fact you gain literally zero security in application. Why even use multisig if all addresses come from the same seed? If someone can put a keylogger on your machine, you bet your ass they can write 20 lines of python to derive the multisig arrangement from a seed.
@_date: 2015-01-19 23:45:13


Oh the bluetooth telepathy option, right.
You are correct, restoring from seed itself can be made immune to keylogging by asking for words in a specific order.
The attack I have in mind goes something like this:
1. In order for a locally stored, single signature wallet to be compromised, the attacker must have access to wallet.dat AND keylogging to avoid brute force decryption.
2. Using their stolen copy of wallet.dat and logged password, can get seed (in pneumonic or hex)
3. If all three sets of keys are derived from the same seed the attacker has compromised only one device, yet able to generate ALL the keys needed to move funds.
Compromising one device is all that is needed for non multisig wallets as well, you gain nothing by implementing multisig in this manner.

@_date: 2015-01-29 16:04:58
As a skeptic myself, I agree. But hopefully the OTP will be used to in an ecryption scheme to ensure that the card is ONLY receiving NFC messages from the phone and not spoofed ones.
@_date: 2015-01-20 16:35:50
If the API is needed to sign all transactions, then how is the cold storage private key (Cold[0]) accessed? Is the authentication once per device? Or is it done per transaction?

GBTC can already trade, but they have a 30-day exclusivity arrangement with Merriman Capital. I tried to call my broker and make this happen first thing Monday morning, but Merriman said they only work with 100k+ clients.

The shares must be backed by bitcoin holdings. The going rate is 0.1BTC = one share GBTC so they can theoretically issue more shares if they acquire more bitcoin.

Governments banning bitcoin would skyrocket the price.
The demand would ATLEAST stay the same, but more likely increase(see Streisand Effect). And now you have to get it from your local shady, bitcoin dealer. That's a price hike not increase.
