That's a much more descriptive version of it yes! But many people on the internet overestimate the general population, without irony people such as ourselves are more in touch with reality and how the future is becoming the present, however the amount of people that are still blissfully unaware BTC, let alone it's implications, is bewildering, the vast ballet of the population have lived their lives under a government, working for a fiat currency which they can then use to buy what they need/want, as have their parents, and their grandparents before them, as autistic as it sounds a lot of people don't like change, the classic "If it ain't broke don't fix it" will become a lot more predominant over the next few years, influencing the public is all banks need to do to gain full control over the world of cryptocurrency, due to democracy, we know it's for the best, but your 81 year old Great Auntie Meredith doesn't.

Underestimating Banks will be the downfall of BTC, you don't understand how influential they really are, they were responsible for the January crash, they control the world, we are just a small group of resistance fighters that they're allowing to think are gaining control over our lives, they could pull the plug tomorrow if they saw fit

These posts are so sad.
All you're doing is trying to convince yourself your get rich quick scheme will work but you're just in your own little bubble of reality making painfully cringey photos such as this one

Bought in November last year, before hype bus came but got caught up in ICO's and lost it all

Money breeds money, if you have initial funds then you have more opportunity... 
Then there's also the possibility you're chatting shit.

What nonsense have I spewed exactly? I speak nothing but the truth, you're talking yourselves in believing that you will profit from bitcoin but the data says otherwise

I don't look at the graph - I don't follow crypto anymore, I am still subbed to Bitcoin because before now it didn't actually bother me seeing the occasional post but this is just childish as fuck.
People believing they'll get rich through  crypto are just sheep thinking they're wolves because they're getting scammed in a new way, you aren't the people making the money, it's the whales that steal £50 from you at a time slowly robbing you as their stack gets bigger.
