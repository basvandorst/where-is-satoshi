I understand your view here but it sounds like you are being a little difficult. I received the exact same questions. I answered in complete but general statements on where the bitcoin came from and how I intend to use it. I didn't try to explain every transaction. They responded with a thank you email and that was the last I heard from them 2 weeks ago. It's unfortunate but I think they are just doing what's required by the regulators.

Interesting, I will have to give it another try at the pump. I agree with your thoughts below on using it. I still don't like the fact that it uses Visa and the merchant has to pay their fees but I figure the more we use it the more bitcoin transactions are being processed. Hopefully, in time, more merchants will accept bitcoin directly.

I received mine 3 days ago. I have tried using it twice with mixed results. My first order was great. I paid my dish bill using the card, just to try it. It was processed instantly at the current market rate (according to the price on coinbase exchange) with no fees. My second attempt was paying for fuel at the pump. The transaction was declined. I am not sure why but I suspect it has to do with their pre-approval.

Isn't this the same story?

For those who read the article but miss the comments. "Stellar network experienced a ledger fork".

I just made my first purchase to try it out. You get the instant 3% discount and another 3% in Egifter points, which can be used on your next purchase.

I can confirm that I very recently received something from them...a refund!

First of all, let's be clear for all the readers out there that this is NOT a bitcoin issue. This is a classic case of you invested/gambled with more than you were prepared to lose. What made this even worse is you used margin on your trades. Yes margin enhances your wins but it also enhances your loses. This situation could have taken place in stocks just as easily.
Now on to what to do. It sounds like you may have $75k of the original $300k. If this money is in fact "the family's" money, I think you need to come clean and let them decide what they would like to do. I wish you luck though. It is a terrible situation.

This is the smart way to use a credit card. However, as most people live paycheck to paycheck and have over $10k in credit card debt, this is not how it is normally used. I agree that bitcoin will never replace the "credit" card but it could definitely impact the payment utility of the card itself.

Received mine today. I set up the account and compared the btc price to coinbase. Circle was cheaper. I'm not in NY though.
@_date: 2014-06-23 02:58:56
I have used it twice now. Once for myself and another to send a gift. I love it!

Although I like your point, the most something can drop in a period is 100%. 300% is not possible.

Watch this if you have questions on whether they are using the Bitcoin Blockchain. They are using Factom which uses Bitcoin.

Umm...shorting it

I'll take a brief stab at it. Although I don't disagree with the statements he is making, I think he is making a critical error. Bitcoin is still a baby. He is looking at the baby and saying he will never be a professional athlete because he is too short, can't jump and can't run.

I think you answered your own question. All you have to do is follow the money. The bankers fund the politicians. Of course they will continue to support the hand that feeds them.

All the panic sellers need to get back in before it goes above $400 again.

Ummm, 2 days ago when this community said it was nothing but spam transactions, my transfer took 3 days. Isn't it great how quick bitcoin transactions have become.

I have been paying this way for probably 5 or 6 months now. The unfortunate truth is that there is no benefit to the customer as compared to credit card. It would be nice if there was a discount. I personally choose to pay via bitcoin to promote it as a viable payment system. Hopefully it continues to grow and catch on.
@_date: 2015-07-21 00:08:06
It is certainly a possibility. However, given the amount of VC investment going into the bitcoin space, it more likely to see people using bitcoin but not necessarily knowing they are using bitcoin.

That's 700 billion, not trillion.

I believe I saw this earlier by the CEO of 21 Inc

Hi John, I just ordered the card. I see this as a great transition until most merchants accept Bitcoin payments directly. I'd like to make a request though. It would be awesome if you also offered the ability to automatically replenish any spent btc, with no fees added.

Anything can happen in the short term. However, I personally believe we continue to see higher levels. We have the halving only a few months out now. We are also hearing really positive current developments such as the EU treating it as currency and the Abra app, which actually uses the Bitcoin Blockchain.

I guarantee miners have to sell most unless they have a large bank roll behind them. Whatever they choose to hang on to, I can only assume they hold for the same reasons as others do. This in itself is demand. As to when the rise happens, my crystal ball is broken. I believe it will. Maybe it's already started? We've gone from $200 to $290 pretty quickly. Some will sell now but I think we are just getting started. Where is future demand going to come from? 250 million people in Indonesia; 350 million people in USA; 1 billion people in India; 1 billion people in China

Spend some time learning about how ALL fiat currencies are created out of debt. Here's a good place to start.

I see a B in the middle of that coin.

When it comes to using bitcoin in conjunction with coinbase/bitpay, it no more difficult to explain than dollar with visa or dollar with PayPal. Basically the same thing only saving the 3%. Sounds like a no-brainer to me.
@_date: 2015-02-15 15:02:35
Please elaborate. How is this good news?
@_date: 2015-02-18 02:43:44
So exactly how does an ONLINE merchant accept CASH upfront? Accepting credit cards is not cash. It is an electronic payment platform that charges 3%. Coinbase &amp; Bitpay allow for instant payment without the 3% fee. How is that a waste of time?

What you fail to realize is that the miners need to pay their power bill. There is a daily selling pressure of 3600 Bitcoin. Likewise there is a demand that meets this supply at the current price. You seem to think that the other 70% will fill this gap after the halving. This will not happen unless the price goes up. Many people, such as myself choose not to sell at $300.
