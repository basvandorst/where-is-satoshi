FYI: this is bull crap

This has to be a joke.

Because if they didn't, eventually the Nazis would have invaded them too. Do you expect compensation every time you do something good?

Here's my advice: 
* Find a financial advisor, someone trustworthy. Hire them. Take their advice before you take ours. 
* Liquidate enough to buy a home with cash and cover the taxes
* Let her leave her job and at least enjoy the financial freedom until she finds something better
* Withdraw a little each month while she does, if you need to
* Don't stop working. Even when you have a lot of magic money, having a job will keep you grounded. Living the rich life is a great way to waste that money quickly. 
Some of the richest people in the world stay rich by being frugal. They don't waste their money, they don't show it off, they don't buy frivolous things. They just invest it wisely and protect their wealth. Food for thought.

Because most people are incredibly stupid with money. Financial advisors spend all their time studying how to protect wealth and they have seen all the dumb stuff that people do, so they can tell you what NOT to do.

It's the slickest, most professional looking and convincing pump and dump operation there is. The fact is, so many people follow their advice that you are guaranteed to make a profit buying whatever coin they announce the moment they announce it and selling a little while later. Just look at what happened to ZenCash when they announced it in their October newsletter. 
As always, trade at your own risk.

Just like capitalism

What if I told you they get things wrong on the same level with most topics?

IMO if the end result is that she never has to work again and she gets to spend more time with the kid, or you can afford to have more kids without having to worry about the cost of it, or you can put away money for your kid(s) to inherit, that's more valuable than stuff you could buy or having a more exciting lifestyle. 
You could also just leave the money in the "bank" and enjoy a nice vacation each year. 
Personally I don't trade crypto to eventually afford a lambo. I trade it so I can build a better life for my family. To each their own, of course.

Would you still be at a loss if you had held until now?

It gives people right to property and the fruit of their own labor. It empowers people to make their own contracts and bargaining agreements without political intervention. How is this hard to understand?

Most people in the world are stupid, yes

These donations created massive sell pressure by handing large sums of Bitcoin to organizations that had no intention of holding Bitcoin long term. The article admits this. Some of these recipients were even going to exchanges and dumping on the open market. 
This was not a net positive for Bitcoin.

I’ve been in crypto since 2014 and 2017 feels like ages ago. Probably the lack of sleep is to blame.

I might have used the term incorrectly, my thinking was in this case they need the cash and don't have it. 
@_date: 2019-01-29 18:43:33
Themselves, maybe? What if they wash trade with user funds and they’ve ended up with a gap?
@_date: 2019-01-29 16:53:00
I wonder if they are running a fractional reserve.

This is a little misleading because the premium in $GBTC was still there right after the crash, so it's not like you bought for $40k and then sold for $17k a day later, you sold for more like $35k. Just wanted to clarify this.
