Agree. Just waitin' on the axe to fall. Then we rebuild.

You can buy gift certificates for my restaurant, coffee cups, tee-shirts and pay for your meal with cryptocurrency at my business.
We've been in business almost 70 years and I am opening us up to accepting cryptocurrency.

I wouldn't even use Paypal unless I just had to but a lot of people are still using traditional methods.

Lord help him. Just give him a real hug and tell him how much he means to you. It's worth more. I swear.

Huh? He's speaking about the spread across multiple exchanges in U.S dollars. He never once mentions Tether and was  simply speaking the spread. It's a pretty good arbitrage opportunity at the moment to be honest.
But the U.S. dollar is not based on anything either if that also should be said. The days of the gold and silver standard are long gone aren't they? :)

Despite what everyone is saying I think it's in a good range right now. With lightning network and crypto in general poised for real world applications I'd wager that we'll look back and say we touched what was possible at 20K then the tech started catching up. I think we will look at 6,500 as a good buy.  
But that's just my gut.

Samsung and Iconloop (Icon) have an MOU and Samsung is using their ChainID in this. Nice to see coins working together for the greater good.

This is true.

Nah, Restauranteur actually. I have really been trying to get my head around these patterns over the last month. ;)
@_date: 2019-01-07 00:00:56
Total manipulation. I have had the last month off and been watching the charts almost full time....   
Yep. Just normal investing here folks. &lt;/s&gt;

Well I've upped my initial buy watching like a hawk from .30 BTC to right over .40 BTC in four weeks just on trades.   
To me, that's awesome.   
 But you are correct. Perhaps I should have not said patterns, but herd mentality.   
I think we have to go down to 3 again but may be wrong. In any case I can realize my gains and keep investing through the year this year. It feels much better than this time last year.  
Cheers.

Just made this for 2019. 2019 will be special.
@_date: 2018-12-31 23:13:58
Awesome. I proposed to my girlfriend the other day on Icon. Good work!
@_date: 2018-12-31 23:13:06
Same to you. It's been a difficult year for everyone in all the crypto space but look at what everyone is building. 2019 will be like a breath of fresh air!
