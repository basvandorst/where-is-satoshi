Money has always had some sort of link to the state. Going back as far as mezopotamia you find coins with state stampings on them.
People sorry to tell you but no evidence exists of money originating out of barter. That is a fairy tale spun by the libertarian crowd.

Blockchain without tokens means a centralized party has to finance the database. So it stop's being blockchain tech and just becomes a database.
Miners issue bitcoins in return for the capital needed to run the blockchain. Bitcoin's represent credits ie permission to write to the blockchain they maintain.

Bitpay going away is good news. Gallipi ran a circus and mislead people when he said merchants were adopting bitcoin, when in fact they were accepting fiat from Bitpay.

Disgusting and morally repulsive. Is there any use case for bitcoin that does not involve pornography, gambling, drugs?

Anyone else tear up on this news? Satoshi is alive and his bitcoins are safe.

99% do not have any money, intellect or purpose outside of mindless consumurism. That is just fact and they should be ignored(like everyone else does). 1% of the world is 70 million people, larger than most countries.

Bitcoin network costs real resources to run and it only makes sense that *shock* users of it pay for it.
This subreddit wants other people picking up the tab for the transfers of bitcoin dust to and from each other.
