OpenSSL isn't "a stable library", it's a massive pile of shit.
Soft forks such as OP_HODL do not require non-mining nodes to be upgraded, transaction prioritization "changes" are not part of the protocol, and don't require any one in particular to upgrade to them.
Whether you like the reasons for which I want to add a node to the network is pretty irrelephant. The point, is that such a node has no actual need for upgrades.

As the CTO of Paymium I can tell you we've already met the majority of the people that are going to be at the hearing, the important thing here is that a chamber of our parliamentary system considers Bitcoin important and significant enough to conduct such a hearing. That's the real victory.

EU directives are translated in local law.
The HMRC communication doesn't say much about maintaining fiat balances on behalf of third-parties, which is the crux of the issue.
The question isn't really "is an exchange subject to banking regulation?" but more "what regulations is a company that maintains fiat balances for its users subjected to". If you state it that way it becomes much easier to answer.
There might be local differences in the interpretation of the directive by individual member states, but I highly doubt that the interpretation the UK made was "sure, collect money from the public and provide bank-like accounts, nope, that doesn't entail any auditing, reporting and compliance requirements".

@_date: 2014-02-27 11:16:50
It's a pleasure arguing with you! Thank you for the time you're spending on researching documentation and references.
However, the interpretation of "commercial agent" is incorrect, being a commercial agent requires that such a relationship is formalised in a proper intermediation mandate. There is no sign of such a thing in their ToS.
Furthermore, the fact that BS will, on-demand, issue electronic money in exchange for fiat (the RippleEUR IOUs they issue, again, not to be confused with the XRP aka "Ripples") finishes to put them out of the scope of what a commercial agent can do, even if there was a proper intermediation contract.
That's incidentally the stance that was held by Mark Karpeles about the MtGox activity. I told him in 2011 that it didn't work like that, followed a few months later by a French court telling him that, indeed, presenting his activity as the activity of a commercial agent was utter bullshit. The main point was that gox was moving funds and issuing payments on the "exclusive instructions of its customers", as opposed to a commercial agent acting in the general framework of a one-time contract.
(And I'm not even going to get into the VAT shitstorm that this interpretation would lead to)
Nice try, but still no :-)


I misworded the argument I guess. It's not because I can't think of anything else that BS accounts must be analyzed as payment accounts, it's because it's a textbook example of what a payment account is, how it works, and what it's used for.
A final digression about Ripple, because that doesn't seem very clear for you (not meaning that in a condescending way though): there are the Ripples, aka XRP, on one hand, and IOUs that circulate on the Ripple network on the other hand.
* Ripples are like Bitcoin, tokens that are not issued in exchange for funds, neither is electronic money
* IOUs that circulate on the Ripple network, *these* are issued in exchange for funds, and tied to the "gateway" that is issuing them
IOUs are redeemable at the gateway that issued them, BS issues electronic IOUs for EUR deposited with them, these IOUs can be transferred among Ripple users, these IOUs *are* therefore pretty clearly electronic money as defined by the PSD.
* [Legal documents]( regarding the 2011 MtGox lawsuit analyzing their activity as being a payment service

I don't think there isn't an obvious answer to this hairy issue. FTR we have/had the same problem in the EU wrt the VAT (value added tax).
I think the answer depends essentially on the taxation treatment of barter.
But that doesn't necessarily rule out altcoin exchanges from operating in Australia as it is not necessarily their responsibility to collect the sales tax on behalf of the traders.
I'm neither Australian, nor a lawyer though.
@_date: 2014-07-03 14:10:56
No. That stems from a fundamental misunderstanding of yours.
Your misunderstanding is that there somehow exists, a universally accepted thing called "the Bitcoin exchange rate". There is no such thing.
Bitcoin is worth, in fiat, whatever the best bid is, it's neither the best ask, nor the midpoint, nor the last trade price, but the bid.
Your reasoning that there somehow is a hidden fee, is based on the mistaken assumption that you could sell your coins at the reported last trade price (say 500 EUR/BTC for example), whereas in reality you could only sell them for the highest bid, at best.

As has been repeatedly said, Bitstamp is not regulated. Just because they have a KYC procedure doesn't mean they do things properly.
They are still mixing all client funds on a corporate account, without any kind of financial license whatsoever.
This will end bad, when UniCredit decides the party is over, then the party is over, Bitstamp gets sued in Slovenia, fined, pays the fine from customer deposits (which are legally their property since they sit on the corporate account), just like this happened to MtGox in France in 2011.
Kraken is in the same case, friendly bank, for now, but zero financial compliance despite all their marketing efforts to advertise the opposite.
The easy way to see this kind of stuff is :
* Are you sending funds to an account in the name of the company owning the exchange? Yes? Bad.
* Is there any sort of financial registration number in their ToS? No? Bad.
The same happened to MtGox in France in 2012, in the US in 2013 and will repeatedly happen until bitcoiners go through the trouble of actually reading the ToS of exchanges with which they sign-up.
You have been warned. Once again.
Stay safe

@_date: 2014-02-26 13:19:47
It's a very good sign if of the account you're sending money to is in the name of the financial institution itself, the institution that is licensed to collect funds from the public.
It *may* be in the name of the corporation owning the exchange if and only if said corporation is licensed itself, at the very least as a financial intermediary who is under contract with an institution that is licensed as a payment/credit institution.
If such is the case it's legally mandatory (at least in Europe) to mention it in the ToS, which is why I advise to carefully read them, skip the marketing talk and go straight for the financial license(s) reference numbers.

Well, who knows, maybe their lawyers feel like it's ok to walk on the thin line.
Or maybe it's because they feel they relationship with their bank makes this whole thing less relevant.
Maybe they feel they can do it because the confusion around the status of Bitcoin.
Or maybe they don't have any lawyers, or that their lawyers are fucktards.

Regarding the tracking of money on the blockchain my opinion is that it is neither possible practically, nor desirable. But that's a completely different issue :)

That's dumb, arbitrage is not done that way, because if you have to wait for your transfer to confirm you're going to get beaten anyway by people who have enough capital to leave at both exchanges. Which is the correct way to do arbitrage, not herpderping like you describe.

I seriously encourage you to contact me at Paymium if you want to pursue this further.
We actually sold Bitcoins to the French customs for one of their operations.
@_date: 2014-02-26 23:22:39
Nope :-)
Firstly, your reasoning is based on the assumption that BS is counterparty to the trades, which is incorrect. It's in their ToS, towards the end.
Secondly, even if the "pre-payments" analysis was correct it would raise VAT-related issues, if as a corporation you sell some generic good/service you have to add VAT on top of the sale price, obviously that's not what's happening there. A notable exception to this is the case of precious metals which usually have their own specific taxation rules.
So if BS isn't counterparty to trades there is no other qualification their accounts could fall in than payment accounts since you're using them to pay other users for gummy bears. Incidentally that's also the analysis that was made by a French court of law in 2011 when Karpeles got in trouble with its bank.
Regarding the Ripple thing you're confusing Ripple coins (XRP) with the RippleEUR for which BS acts as gateway (ie. the issuer), remember that the only thing that circulates on the Ripple network are IOUs for fiat (and XRP of course), the *exact* definition of electronic money.


I didn't say that, I said Bitcoins are unregulated :)
You also seem to be overestimating the differences of interpretation of the PSD between member states, the UK has PSPs too, Ukash being a good example of a british PSP.
Again, the issue isn't Bitcoin, it's the fiat accounts.
@_date: 2014-03-25 22:58:25
They didn't arrest the guy by using coin-tracking techniques.
They found him using good old police work and used the coins to entrap him from what I heard.
When they bought the coins they simply told us they needed some for an "operation" but they didn't say much more, kind of sane if you think about it, they weren't allowed to share any details with us. Likewise it's not like they report to their banker when they pull some cash, that's going to get used to purchase some drugs, out of an ATM.

Hey Jesse, Davout here
Nice to meet you!
I was actually referring to the EU regulations, it's good that you're registered as an MSB in the US, but afaik you're banking in the EU.
Whether you're registered as an MSB in the US is irrelevant to the business you do within Europe, with European customers.


No, you're not registered as an agent, OTOH, bitcoin.de is.
The way you organize fund movements among your corporate accounts is probably as relevant as my underwear in this discussion, the points are:
 * that they're your corporate accounts, 
 * that you provide a service in Europe that hasn't much to do with a  US MSB license (the laws in the US and Europe are different, surprise, surprise!), 
 * that in addition to that you are, either confused about what it means to "operate under Fidor's banking license" or should mention an agent contract in your ToS, like bitcoin.de properly does
Competition is a good way to push everyone forward, towards competitive service, but also towards increased customer funds safety.
Chill out, nothing personal, just a few facts I'm interested in discussing with civil folks!

Yes you are. You can not compare prices expressed in two different currencies without assuming an exchange-rate value.
What you call "exchange rate" is always an approximation, in efficient markets the best bid is always less than or equal to the best ask for an arbitrary asset.
@_date: 2014-02-26 22:33:29
First of all, Bitcoins are absolutely irrelevant to the issue, the questions would be similar if Bitstamp traded gummy bears.
What you outlined is a good way of putting it "People who keep balances at Bitstamp give up ownership of their money and only get a claim on the company in return". The nature of the claim is what is defined at the European level as "electronic money", which, if the analysis is continued, makes them an e-money issuer, as described in the PSD (Payments Services Directive).
The case is even more clear cut with the RippleEUR they issue, it's a claim on the issuer, expressed in fiat, and redeemable in fiat.
If you think about it from another angle you'll realize the service an exchange provides is essentially peer-to-peer payments, I pay John for gummy bears with BS standing in between. This activity is described in the PSD as well.
In conclusion, the accounts that are opened are not bank accounts, and don't function as such at all (maybe I shouldn't have used the "bank-like" terminology), however they have the exact characteristics of what is referred to as a "payment account" by the PSD. Maintaining payment accounts *is* covered by the PSD as a regulated activity.

Excellent question.
Paymium is the first payment processor to also operate an exchange. This is very good because cutting an intermediary out of the loop creates value for everyone.
In other words, since we already make money on the trading volume of the exchange, there is simply no need for a hidden fee in the exchange rate.
If it is evidence you want I suggest you go try one of our merchants and see for yourself.

Yeah well, accounting is what keeps me busy the most these days.
Being a counterparty to trades doesn't solve anything, because you trade the issue of compliance for the issue of VAT.
Regarding your questions related to AML on BTC transfers the answer is no. We don't do specific AML checks for large Bitcoin transfers, that might change the day Bitcoin gets legally defined as some sort of monetary instrument in France, but to date they're still gummy bears.
We also avoid this issue altogether by requiring that 100% of the accounts be verified, it removes a whole class of problems altogether.

No shocker here. That doesn't mean that a license isn't required to hold AUD on behalf of a third party, if you read carefully...

Like a lot of questions the answer to this is: "it depends".
You're dealing with humans at a bank, each with his own specific set of incentives that may or may not have an interest in helping you.
Generally speaking it's hard to integrate fully with a bank for a lot of reasons, some technical, some political.
Another approach is to integrate with financial institutions that aren't banks but are still licensed to hold funds on behalf of third-parties, in Europe institutions like this are referred to as PSPs (Payment Service Providers).
If you want to dig this further I encourage you to do some research on the Payments Services European Directive for which I've linked a starting point below.

- Bank issues a SEPA recall, which may or may not be successful
- Stolen customer gets funds back from Unicredit (Bitstamp's bank) or maybe not, because honoring SEPA recall requests is not mandatory for the receiving end
- Customer's bank is pissed off that it has to handle it's pissed-off customer
- Customer's bank is pissed off that the flaws in their online banking security make them look bad
- Customer's bank may even sometime refund valuable customers from their own pocket
For all these reasons, it makes complete sense for them to simply prevent people from sending money to an obviously touchy IBAN and justify it by "because fraud", rather than "too many of our customers got pwnd due to our shitty IT".

Without SW, LN participants must simply run their own node to watch their own channels, which also happens to be the correct incentive alignment.

Code complexity at the LN level isn't really problematic. And TBH I don't really care about the LN devs having some more coding work to do, it's a second layer after all.
LN without SW means you can't delegate channel watching to someone else, it's not really about "corner cases". If you want channel monitoring you'll have to have your own node, with transaction malleability present you won't be able to delegate it trustlessly.
So on one hand there's SW which would incentivize people to *not* run nodes, introduce some more code complexity to Bitcoin itself, and make the dangerous precedent that the Bitcoin consensus rules aren't actually immutable.
And on the other hand you have the option where Bitcoin shows clearly it's core rules aren't to be tampered with, and requires people to actually run their own node to participate trustlessly.
Seems to me the choice is pretty easy.

So? We don't have a block size problem yet either.


It doesn't work like that, there's really no reason for a pool to set a $1 threshold when the marginal cost for including an extra transaction is order of magnitudes lower than that.
For what magical reason would this particular miner forgo a $0.9999 profit if this marginal cost is $0.0001 ?

You're not listening, it does not make sense for a miner to "demand $X for a transaction".
A miner will include a transaction in his block if it is profitable for him, which starts at one satoshi with big blocks and O(1) propagation.
There is no "miners will group together and make some cartel to force some minimal fee" because as soon as you have a single miner that disagrees, he gets to take all the money left behind by the cartel.

It's obviously up to LN devs to make their implementations compatible.
It's factually correct that LN doesn't require SW to work. Without SW it simply requires people to run their own node to watch their own channels. Quite the correct alignment of incentives.
To rephrase, the proposition that the "LN would suck without SW" boils down to "we must make a complex change to Bitcoin, remove signatures from blocks, create a precedent of the Bitcoin consensus rules being up for negotiation, so that people who can't be bothered to run a node can use it in some other form".

Not saying an MSB license is necessary at all to do business in Europe, I just pointed out that :
 * It's irrelevant in this discussion,
 * And that even if it were, the specific license you hold would *not* be the correct one as you seemed to be inclined to believe
What you're missing has been discussed extensively in the thread you're apparently commenting about, and more specifically [here]( for exact details.
Holding fiat on behalf of third-parties is a heavily regulated, and precisely codified field, I do encourage you to peruse the European Payments Services Directive as a general piece of advice.
Bottom line: if you're maintaining fiat balances on behalf of third-parties, that requires at best a Payments Services Provider (PSP) license or at worst as a full-fledged credit institution (bank) license.
Saying that you rely on Fidor implies they have the customer data on file and perform their KYC diligences themselves or delegate it to a registered agent.
You're not registered as an agent apparently, correct me if I'm wrong.
Just scratching the surface here, let's get a little bit deeper:
 
 * Issuing electronic currency requires a Electronic Currency Issuer license, which is above a simple PSP license, you issue electronic currency, as defined by the PSD, each time you issue a EUR-denominated Ripple IOU (more about this in the previously linked discussion),
 * Maybe I'm wrong here, but the margin trading features you seem to be offering would probably qualify as providing users with some sort of credit, another juicy can of worms, let's not dig in that direction yet
I'm sure you mean well, I'm sure you throw lots of money at your lawyers, I'm sure you don't mean to rip anyone off, but that doesn't change the fact that your current setup appears quite flaky for someone who reads your ToS and reads the European Law.

There can never be a centralized pricing schedule in a decentralized system.
Furthermore I think you vastly overestimate the need for speedy transactions where there is a big difference between 10 minutes confirmations and 3 hours confirmation. And you'll get a 3 hours confirmation if ~5% of the miners don't participate in your vision of a mining cartel.
You cannot have a sane transaction fee market anymore than you can have a sane sand market in a desert. Or a ice-cubes market on the north pole.

Not with O(1) propagation times.
In such a case miners have an incentive to include any transaction with more than a single satoshi as fee.
And even if you have a million of those per block, that's still like a bitcent per block in fees, good luck keeping the miners interested...
@_date: 2014-03-27 17:12:39
They *say* they maintain client funds segregated, that's something you can do when you're a PSP (Payments Services Provider), being a "bureau de change" is something completely different than a PSP which is *legally* mandated to segregate funds. The *legally* part is the important one.
The fact that they're banking in Poland and that they "maintain accounts and relationships with several other banks in Europe to ensure continuous usage" isn't really reassuring. If you read between the lines it means : "we weren't able to find a bank in the UK so we settled for a polish one, maybe we told them about our Bitcoin activity, maybe not".

It's not as clear cut.
When you have a soft-fork'd rule that went into action recently without a very large hashrate differential and with lots of nodes still running older version then yes, reverting it is much easier than an actual hard-fork.
To exaggerate a bit, when Bitcoin just soft-forked, it is in a situation where the "reversal" hard-fork is very easy to perform because a vast majority of nodes don't enforce the new rule yet.

Yet the point is pretty simple: the immutability of the Bitcoin rules has much more value than these features on a second layer.

The problems of Segwit were already explained, should you want to know more, that's up to you I guess. The "gains" of Segwit are really not that interesting, it basically allows a couple extra features for the LN, and that's it.


How can you, with a straight face, assert that it was "nothing significant", and on the same line ask "what was the damage" ?
Since when is a chain fork "not significant"? Are you insane? Am I missing something? Is this In this case the damage could be contained because it was early 2013, Bitcoin was much, much smaller, and it was still possible to get a majority of mining pool operators in the same IRC chatroom at the same time.


Why would I be afraid? Apparently the Bitcoin network as a whole is pretty sane and therefore cheerfully pisses on the "core" devs heads from the height of its insane hashrate.
@_date: 2017-01-23 17:50:52

Was explained up there, because they think Segwit's problems are not worth the gains.

That is correct, but not the point.
The original point was that currency debasement is the only way for governments to be able to repeatedly bail out bad actors, and that it is not possible, and certainly not sustainable with straight taxation.
Which demonstrates that Bitcoin does indeed prevent bailouts that don't come at an actual cost for the one doing the bailing out.


which has to match the bank's public proof of solvency on one hand.

Of course, fractional reserve is legal up to the solvency ratios, and is no particular secret. The solvency-proof requirement won't be a legal one, it's simply that such financial institutions would have a much easier time attracting new deposits and customers by being able to communicate and prove their solvency ratio.


That's true for paper cash, not so much for Bitcoin. For Bitcoin it's actually the opposite, small amounts are tedious to move, and cost a lot in fees: good luck moving 10 million euros accross continents in less than half an hour, for less than 1,000 € in fees...


Absolutely. Banks runs are black swans though, they don't happen often, but when they do... The point here is that with comparable solvency ratios (say 10%, and I'm probably generous) a bank-breaking run would only require 101 people with a million in assets. Definitely not far fetched.


We're talking past each other. I'm not saying Bitcoin will destroy banking, in the sense of "financial services providing support in the allocation of capital and day-to-day payments", I'm saying Bitcoin will destroy socialism by making the group unable to steal from the individual through currency debasement.

This is a strawman, the political message is not about "banks being inefficient as payment networks". Bankruptcies are a normal part of business that Bitcoin won't prevent in any way, it might even make them faster. But Bitcoin *will* prevent bail-outs, since they will have an actual cost associated to them, it's those who do the bailing out who'll end up bankrupt, without the possibility of conjuring new money into existence.
So yes, the statement is perfectly relevant, and perfectly underlines that the money quantity will now be perfectly *finite*. (And no, Bitcoin and fractional reserve are not mutually exclusive, there'll be banks inflating the currency supply by doing it, but no, without bailouts there'll be a limit to it, good lenders will prosper, and bad lenders will go broke).


See previous response. Ludwig von Mises doesn't write much of these quotes nowadays, and certainly not in contemporary newspapers. Also the "libertarian author" could have been seen as an "accomplice" in your theory.


Again, maybe you're right in your interpretation of the facts, but again, this is strictly not exclusive with a political statement.


See first answer, the headline looks perfectly suitable to me. I don't think he was in a particular rush either way. Do note that he communicated on his ideas way before the genesis block date.
To me, the timeline looks like this :
 - Nov. 2008 : E-mails about his ideas and concept, keeps developing
 - Jan. 3 2009 : Sees this absolutely perfect headline, is almost ready, generates the genesis block, dates it from that point of time
 - Jan. 9 2009 : (six days after) communicates about the new release.
Without a particularly interesting headline like this one popping up randomly, he'd probably have generated his genesis block on Jan. 9th.

Printing more money is the only unlimited and frictionless way of taxing people. You can otherwise tax people up to what they have (you'll probably face exponential resistance doing that).
The printed money supply is infinite, the directly taxed money supply is bounded by what people actually own. 
That's a fundamental difference, with regular taxation you can only have bailouts on a limited scale financed by cash (similar to an insurance scheme) where the one doing the bailing out bears an actual cost for doing so.


I'm waiting, not going anywhere.

It's pretty obvious that those who broadcast transactions for a coffee actually desire coffee. But that's not the point, the point is that the network as a whole might not be interested in replacting these bytes accross *each single full node*, every single one of them expending  CPU time for verification, and storage space by permanently recording the transaction.


Bitcoin does not need to "convince" people, or be nice to them, or easy to use. 'People' don't get to try SWIFT with a few cents before deciding whether they're ok with it, nobody's asking their opinion.

I didn't say you said it, I said that you could logically consider this a hardfork only, and only if you also held the opinion that "the code is the spec".
If you think there exists an undocumented specification that bitcoin-core developers adhere to tacitly, then it can only follow logically that what happened was a discrepancy between the specification and the implementation that was pushed, in other words a bug.
A bug that caused a short fork, granted, but that wouldn't qualify as a hardfork in my book. If there were official support for older releases, the fix would probably have been backported.
@_date: 2015-08-21 21:49:59
There is no consensus today that blocks should bloat to accommodate the idiocy of confused, and technically illiterate, micro-transacting monkeys.
This is not a debate, this is a fact. If there actually were a broad consensus, the block size would have been bumped a good while ago.
So if this consensus existed before, like you claim, it must have shifted. 
But then again, the idea that it existed before is retarded, I'm here since 2010, and I did not "sign up" for this. For as long as I've been around, everyone with a functional cortex, has consistently been saying that raw Bitcoin was not the correct tool to handle arbitrarily large volumes of transactions. For the pretty simple reason that blockchains do not scale well, by design. So no, you don't get to assert what I've signed up for.
What you get to do is go stand, facing the corner of the room, and think (yeah, tough, right?) a little bit, because no, nobody cares about you wanting a "faster horse".

They're quite common in Bitcoin.


There's no such thing if all the transactions that are valid for this, ahem, "altcoin", are also valid Bitcoin. An altcoin is something that does not validate under Bitcoin's rules. A hardfork creates an altcoin, a softfork is... meh...

That's unrelated to what I wrote.


I'm not interested in arguing your straw man that "there is nothing that holds eternal universal value".


Just because the block time interval is 10 minutes does not mean transactions will take a single block to confirm, with consistently full 1mb blocks, maybe they'll settle in a couple of hours, or in a day. And that's perfectly fine.
I don't care what satoshi set out to engineer, this isn't a religion. Bitcoin sucks at payments but is good at keeping in control of its actual owner without much effort, which is a feature that nothing else is able to provide today.


The technical definition of inflation refers to prices, not money supply.


Look, you should stop with these "guarantees" straw men, nobody is arguing that.


No, I mean that its supply is known, that it can't be debased.

Yes, and it'll be the transactions nobody really wanted anyway that'll get dumped, leaving their seat for the most valuable use cases to support.


If you let your node eat an infinity of RAM that's really your problem, not the protocol's, or the network. Just drop a bunch, they'll appear inside blocks anyway if they were important to have after all.


Either it gets a place in the next block, or you're not paying enough.

The March 2013 accidentally lulzy hardfork.


You do realize that this creates massive incentives for cartel members to cheat one another and that this essentially reduces to the prisoner's dilemma? The only way this could ever be reliably pulled-off is by a single entity hashing faster than the rest of the network, and keeping that edge for a while, and at that point we're pretty much discussing the documented limitation of Bitcoin, which isn't unlike "crypto is broken, because if I have the secret key I can eavesdrop on your conversations".


How is that so complicated?


That would be because that's how a soft fork is defined,


The system will stabilize to one single branch as soon as 51% of the miners enforce the soft fork, letting those who don't enforce them lose money, which is creates a growing incentive to further stabilize.
While this might create temporary larger reorgs than usual, clients that haven't updated will, other than that, be mostly unaffected.


If you're referring to the "the implementation is the protocol" related issues, it's pretty off-topic to this discussion. Otherwise, do enlighten me.


That's not really a problem, should I wish to split my coins after a hard fork, there's a bunch of ways to do that reliably.


You aren't familiar with the idea that these non-fungible coins could be traded across forks and actually give the power to choose to the large holders instead of the miners?


See previous answer, there can't be a lasting coexistence of two branches of a hard fork, because it's a fundamentally unstable economic equilibrium.

There's a difference between obfuscation and encryption. Obfuscation relies on the obfuscation algorithm remaining a secret, encryption relies on a key remaining a secret.
It then follows that there can not exist a secure obfuscation method, *especially* in this particular case, because by definition, knowledge of the obfuscation algorithm has to be known by anyone wishing to enable 2FA.
Now if you want to do encryption, you'll have to transmit a key as well, *aaaand you're back at square one*.

I really mean "does not depreciate". Whether some things appreciate faster is irrelevant. Like Groucho said "Either this man is dead or my watch has stopped."

Seriously, I don't know if it's old age, alzheimer, or the prolonged exposure to academia that is responsible for your brainrot, but either way I do encourage you to review the precise definition of a soft fork.
Someone having the majority of hashing power could theoretically prevent any transactions from going through and slightly delay halvings (but not for an *arbitrarily* long time of course), but that is in theory, in a vacuum populated by spherical cows and other such nonsense. Whether this makes any sort of economical sense, or is possible for an arbitrarily long time without the assumption of infinite resources, is entirely undemonstrated if not completely retarded.

Let me quote from the article: "This means that someone who wishes to pay for very little with Bitcoin will be forced to use something else, so to speak is forced to "give his seat" to someone richer. This is exactly the point and the intent of Bitcoin : to force the poor to yield to the rich, universally, as a matter of course."

Yes, not necessary with bitcoin directly. Maybe using a network of provably solvent financial institutions, able to serve everyone, not being bound by KYC and AML.


Market dynamics are currently not exactly in favor of micro-transactions, and it doesn't really look these precise dynamics are going anywhere.


That would be hashcash and would consist of doing a certain proof of work for each sent e-mail, in order to make it provably expensive, not exactly "sending bitcoin", but more like "burning some bitcoin", without even requiring the overhead of an actual blockchain.

@_date: 2015-07-06 23:32:56
The limited size of the blocks that the miners currently broadcast has no logical link on whether we 'need' a hard cap or not.
Because without it, miners can reduce *their* blocks size, but attackers can broadcast massive turds for everyone to process and keep around.

Nothing stops anyone from saying anything. The network as a whole and the alignment of incentives prevents people from doing stupid shit and shooting themselves in the foot. The bitcoin network itself doesn't really care about what satoshi envisioned, and that's the beauty of it, it's like a kid, you birth it, but you don't have the slightest clue about who it actually will become, you can push it one way or another, but only to a certain extent.


There is no logical link between the first and the second part of your proposition. Or if there is, the implication is that satoshi was infaillible which I refuse to agree with, being a rational person. In other words, maybe Bitcoin can be a reliable currency in a different way than satoshi envisioned.

You won't have that for fiat of course. But if it was possible we wouldn't need bitcoin in the first place.


I did, you are correct.


I am referring to the prevention of currency debasement which is achieved by anyone being able to verify the full history independently.


If that's so it'll be because blocks are consistently full, but wait, doesn't that mean success? So which one is failure, and which one is success?

I have no idea about this, I'm saying it is technically possible. I am personally working on it for my own business, and you can demand it from the entities you give your business to. We are all responsible and will all get exactly what we deserve.


Because your logical fallacy there is "no true scotsman", in other words you argue that Bitcoin should behave some way because that particular way is the "true" way that you claim was set forth by the holy satoshi in his first white-paper coming. And I don't usually discuss logical fallacies. And if for the sake of entertaining the conversation I actually did, I'd point out that the core feature that was intended was advertised in the genesis block and is the inability to debase the currency. See? We're not going to get very far debating what satoshi thought, intended, or had for lunch.

@_date: 2015-07-30 16:25:18


Which doesn't have anything to do with protocol-level consensus.
If it had any sort of significance, miners wouldn't have customized their software to skip block verification altogether for example.

Let's stick with the original point shall we?
People don't pay if they're not forced to, outside of charity of course, and I don't think it's a good idea for Bitcoin to rely on charity.


Actually not really, because the block space is a resource for which exploitation represents a socialized cost, in other words, when a miner sells a slot in a block, it's every single node that bears a cost. 
Constraining a socialized cost doesn't look anything like socialist to me, it's more like restricting the amount of wood that can be chopped out of the rainforest per unit of time, to ensure renewal of the common resource.
@_date: 2015-07-24 07:50:41
Sure. Miners technically *can*. But ultimately the ones who decide which coin lives or dies, are the rich, the ones able to dump on a branch and hoard on the other.

You assert causality "miners naturally limit the size of blocks" when only correlation "blocks are currently maxed out at the soft limit" is observed. Correlation does not imply causality.

if the point is to collect transaction fees, it makes more economical sense to mine on that fork. the concept of 'attacking' it doesn't really make sense.
however, by shorting one of the coins, large holders can sink one at the benefit of the other, because then, transaction fees become negligible in comparison with the benefits of mining on the fork that has the coins that aren't being massively dumped.

Actually yes, mined blocks need to be broadcast and need to be downloaded and checked by everyone actually using Bitcoin, that is, actually checking the full history independently.

We observe a factual decrease in full node numbers. If it's harder to maintain a full node then I don't see why that trend would reverse.


IBLT makes them propagate in constant time, if they weren't big, IBLT wouldn't be necessary, but it doesn't help with storage, download, bandwith and verification costs, at least for the initial sync.

 - general ineptitude, unhelpfulness, and dismissiveness of their "support" staff,
I have tried them, gave them a few chances, I will never use them again.
@_date: 2015-07-07 10:37:28
What I am saying, is that IBLT actually removes the incentive for miners to keep the block size small.
It creates the perverse incentive to include whatever comes their way and carries a fee if they don't run the risk anymore of getting their block orphaned due to a large size that propagates slowly since IBLT would greatly help with constant time broadcast.

It does allow me to independently check that I'm actually receiving Bitcoin, and not some ersatz. That's a core feature of money, being able to independently verify its authenticity. I never claimed it "helped" the network in any way other than by giving it increased resilience, and making the blockchain data very widely available.


We'll never know for sure, but despite that I see it parrotted around, as if it were some sort of fact. There are myriads of other cryptos which differ from Bitcoin in lots of ways, most of them NOT being their block size limit.


Did I ever say that? I said I didn't want to fix something that isn't broken on the grounds of fabricated problems sold with artificial urgency. Certainly not if the "solution" was decided in some sort of "committee".

@_date: 2015-09-08 06:20:40
If you make it harder to run a full node you'll make it harder to receive money independently, you'll make it harder for bootstrapping nodes to find peers (and that's also the case for pruned/castrated nodes), you'll make it harder for SPV wallets. Not to mention that you also make it harder for people to keep miners in check by auditing their work.
In other words, if you make it harder to run a node, you make the network more fragile.
If these are acceptable to you, you may be better served moving debt on Ripple because that's pretty much how it works.

@_date: 2015-09-06 22:50:37


That's soft-forking, and it doesn't have to be private.
The only voting you describe makes miners able to restrict themselves to a subset of the rules I'm already okay with.
But they don't, and shouldn't, get to vote for relaxing these rules.
This is pretty similar to miners overwhelmingly voting for a 42mn coin supply, nobody is asking their opinion.

My proposal does not prevent 0-conf transactions in any way, they can still exist, and any party can independently assess the chances that it eventually makes it into a block given the transaction's fee.
In other words, this proposal makes it impossible to stupidly assume that no matter what junk you throw at the blockchain, it'll eventually get included and confirmed. And that's a goddamn feature.
Not that relying on zero-confs was a smart thing to do in the first place anyway...
@_date: 2015-09-01 22:06:55


There's a reason behind some of the magic numbers, some others are pretty random, thing is, they're here now, they're a given. If Bitcoin to be re-created from scratch lots of stuff would probably differ. But that's irrelevant to what's necessary to *change* them.


That's not my intention.


When you say this you should probably clarify *who* is refusing, if you mean the 'core devs', they're not my personal alpha and omega of bitcoin. 
Anyway, I think the root of the problem is that people want to change Bitcoin, without accepting the consequence of altcoining themselves away, which implies less moons and prices, boiling down to the fundamental issue some have with it, that "Bitcoin is unfair".


I'm just trying to clarify, in the thought experiment, there's also the built-in assumption that both cases are mutually exclusive.


Truth is not always in the 'middle ground' on one hand, and on the other hand there might not even exist a 'truth' or 'optimal magic values'.


You seem perfectly reasonable, yet you somehow have the expectation that this environment isn't going to be messy. Well, too bad, it *is* messy. Bitcoin is a messy, dangerous, scam-infested, controversial environment, better get used to it.
You can't really expect hearn to shut up, and you can't expect the core devs to accommodate his fantasies... So I guess the bickering isn't going anywhere, is it?


you expect people to be civilized? on the internet?
@_date: 2015-09-05 21:21:19

I know, but that doesn't change the point. Which is an accessory point anyway, the main point being that Bitcoin is not consumer-level technology.
@_date: 2015-09-08 00:12:16
First of all it's not "why add an artificial scarcity" it is "why we should keep a critical incentive".
If I had to summarize the argumentation I'd simply argue that miners don't only consume their own resources, but they also use the common good, namely space on everyone's hard drive, and the bandwidth used by nodes to relay transactions. And you can't expect a natural economic equilibrium to form when a private gain is balanced out with a public loss.
The limit doesn't impede on the miner's competitive environment since all of them are subject to the exact same limit.
Also read [this]( for a discussion about marginal costs of including transactions in blocks.

How does it make any kind of sense that people having different requirements for their different use cases all use the same system?

@_date: 2015-09-09 22:53:30


Even if this was true, you said yourself that "Peers in the network have a varying requirement of confidence", it obviously follows that some use cases can perfectly be addressed with good enough substitutes for this coin.
Now that's not really true, when you settle a debt, the common currency is usually preferred, which doesn't mean a reasonable other currency, of equivalent value can never be substituted for it.
When you go to the restaurant, the prices are quoted in your local currency, and most of the times multiple payment methods are accepted: cash, credit card etc. There's never the religious requirement that everybody pays exclusively in even numbered 20 dollar bills...

No, I'm saying the transaction is delayed because there is an additional lag in transaction confirmation for the merchant.
Face-to-face transactions credit card transactions, and online ones with 3DSecure can hardly be charged back, from the PoV of the merchant the experience is frictionless and secure, even during peaks, whereas Bitcoin simply delays transactions.

According to what you just said it should read "Download this page locally **and audit it carefully**".
And even this isn't very secure, are you familiar with the Android random number generator bug that got a bunch of people buttraped?
Basically a flawed PRNG made the ECDSA signatures extremely weak, and made it possible to recover the keys from signatures. The point here is that crypto is hard, and hard in a pretty specific sense. Hard in the sense that if you invert a single screw in the book holder you're making, your whole house instantly burns down.
A better approach for this product would be to stay away from the "signing" part, because obviously, the dude who made it has no idea what he's doing.

If the meaning of "unexperienced" is not very clear to you, I'll let you borrow my (dictionary)[ Once you're clear I suggest we keep the topic on your actual idiocy rather than on your meta-idiocy.


Like what? Make sure not to confuse *actual facts* with your own rich imagination.


Why should I accept your built-in assumption that Bitcoin is consumer-level technology? Are people not using planes to travel despite most of them not having the slightest clue about the inner workings of a turbo-fan engine?
The passengers of the airplanes are not idiots because they have no idea how the turbo-fan works, *you* are an idiot, because *you* are the one insisting that jet engines should be dumbed down to the level where understanding how axial compressors, combustion chambers and turbines because "they are worthless if one can't use them directly".
Analogies are very good tools to work around the intellectual limitations of the audience, so let me keep using this one with you. Bitcoin is the plane, planes are awesome and complex, there are much more people who travel with planes than people who actually pilot planes. That doesn't preclude the passengers from benefiting from the technology. Planes changed the world without everybody having their own plane parked in their own driveway.
Now go do some thinking, you wasted enough of my time.

Let's not get into what Satoshi "intended" or what "reasons" he had. Bitcoin is what it is, Satoshi is not here and this is not some kind of church.


You can hardly speak on behalf of "the world", because what if some people do need it, who are you to know? What if some people do actually think there's tremendous value in a unit account that no one can cheat? What if there was value in not having the money supply depending on politicians?
What if you were simply a part of the congregation of idiots that spontaneously forms around anything revolutionary? (well, a different congregation than but one nonetheless).


Since you really insist on what Satoshi said and didn't say, let's quote him properly, he said it "could" be lifted.


And that's understandable, some people feel like they did just buy a hammer and really want to see nails everywhere. That fees have to be paid is a no brainer, and that without correct incentives to pay them they won't be anything else than microscopic is also a no-brainer.

There are a few vulnerabilities that exist with this, just because they haven't been actively exploited doesn't magically make them go away.


It seems my previous point did not sink in. Your key does not need to leak directly, or even encrypted for it to possibly end up compromised. ECDSA signatures use random numbers as part of the signing process, a compromised PRNG means your keys can leak through the signatures themselves. Checking the traffic leaving your computer wouldn't help at all here.


I haven't seen the actual code. And this is not about "liking" it or not. This isn't a tupperware meeting.


Chill out, have a deep breath.


Actually yes, precisely in this exact sense.


That is absolutely not what I am saying. More reading, less imagining.


The braindamage in this reasoning is pretty mind-blowing: *"I sodomized this slut without a condom, I didn't get AIDS. Therefore unprotected sex is safe"*.


Actually yes, in the scenario where the private key leaked from the signature and you re-use this particular address.

@_date: 2015-09-07 06:44:14


You are correct, so what? Bitcoin is experimental in its very nature.
We do however have some empirical data regarding non-full blocks with the five last years of activity. This data strongly suggests that the number of nodes will decrease with in increase in resources to run one, which isn't very surprising, and that in the absence of a suitable fee pressure fees have remained ridiculously low, and nowhere near enough to pay for Bitcoin's security.


I didn't argue that. The "stress tests" were nowhere near noteworthy, or... stressful.


A legit transaction is one who ended up in a block, no matter what you'd like it to be. In exactly the same way the legitimate owner of BitCoins is strictly defined as "he who can sign a transaction with the relevant private keys".


Have you ever considered that maybe, maybe Bitcoin is not consumer-level technology? In the same way nuclear fission is not consumer-level technology? 


First of all, it was all decided by the  cult, not blockstream, whether blockstreamers may also be hidden asseteers is another topic. The cap was public all along, the idea of a fee market was public all along, so the idea that the fee market is a "surprise" is so fucking retarded that even the XT folks now make that argument reluctantly.


That's not really how this works, the PIC calculates how much he needs, including safety margins, and loads up just that. Anyway it's not a really valid comparison, should there not be enough for everyone in bitcoin, and should the coffees really need to be a blockchain, then there's always merge-mined altcoins.


I do get your idea that it's arbitrary, but so what? It's been arbitrarily set to 1mb, so has the coin supply, so what?
@_date: 2015-09-01 15:49:29




It's not a problem, even when the network gets 'attacked', bump your fees slightly, and poof, you confirm in a timely fashion.
If ATM operators can't get their transactions to confirm, it's up to them to fix their problem. They're not welcome to push it onto Bitcoin itself.


Yes, blocks *will* eventually be consistently full, and that's a feature, because once the block reward goes away there won't be anything else than fees to secure the network.

@_date: 2015-09-01 13:46:38
Premature optimization is not *always* bad, however, when you aren't sure that something will be a problem, and if the 'fix' can't be rolled-back later, you'd be much better served waiting to see what *actually* happens.
Maybe most users will use a third-party such as coinbase or whatever? Maybe bitcoin evolves in a direction where the value of transfers increase but the volume not so much? Who's to know?
In this context, the only sensible course of action is obviously to refrain from compulsively wanting to fix stuff that isn't broken.

If IBLT is deployed, it removes the incentive to keep blocks small for miners, and actually incentivizes them to throw whatever carries a non-zero fee into their blocks.

When they ask for the books, well, that contains the transaction histories, that's kind of how accounting works, and gets audited.
And I'd even go further, it would be perfectly normal to ask for transaction IDs and addresses to check that what's declared on the assets side of the book matches an actual physical asset, be it Bitcoin, it's exactly the same with an account balance at an other bank, the tax authority can perfectly request matching bank statements.

The OP is misinformed, the words "Monnaie électronique" have a precise definition. Electronic money in the context of European and French regulations means "a transferrable claim on the issuer, expressed in fiat.
Bitcoin is not electronic money as it is legally defined in Europe and France. It is absolutely not in the scope of this article. Which country would be moronic enough to try and forbid Bitcoin ? The Streisand effect would be massive.

Yes absolutely, I think so too. Ripple IOUs are IMHO a perfect match to the definition of "electronic money".
But just one thing, these regulations are made on a European level and already a few years old, the link that the OP provides is simply a French transposition in the French law of a European directive. Nothing really new here.
But I think you're absolutely right and that Ripple faces even bigger regulatory challenges than Bitcoin because it's easier to stick it into the already existing (and bloated) regulatory framework.

As far as I know they only buy and sell Bitcoins directly (ie. not intermediating a transaction).
In no way do they store funds on behalf of third parties or otherwise transfer funds amongst their users.
They simply buy and sell an asset, like they'd buy or sell any kind of commodity, the key point here is that they *are* counterparty to transactions, unlike other exchanges which intermediate a trade during which currency transmission occurs.
Last time I checked Coinbase was by no means transmitting money on behalf of third-parties.
What makes you say they are? Like, what feature of the service they offer would qualify as money transmission?

fail, block timestamp is part of header and gets hashed into the proof-of-work
you wouldn't be able to generate blocks far ahead of their "due" timestamp otherwise the network would simply discard them

Bitcoin-Central runs on Rails 3.2 and is not impressed by these shenanigans.
It also has been operating since 2010 without a single hack taking place.

Avemo is talking about some imaginary "grave fundamental issues" not specifically about whatever.
Using resource locators containing key materials is perfectly fine as long as the URL remains secret. Pretty much the same way cash stays secure in your wallet if your wallet stays in your pocket. 
And that's not something hidden in the guts of the system, it's litterrally written all over it so you know exactly how it works.

You mean I could simply publish an address and pretend to be collecting donations on behalf of Bram Molenaar, right ?
Could be the case I agree, he's going to publish something on the vim mailing lists though, so it should get cleared up soon.

I'm the CTO of Paymium.
And you are an idiot.
Instawallet was hacked. Fact.
But this "issue" you describe had absolutely nothing to do with it. Which is precisely the reason why your begging for a tip was diligently ignored.
I am, for the last time hopefully, going to spell out, in simple words, why you are an idiot :
 - Google can not magically guess Instawallet URLs unless Instawallet was leaking them, and it wasn't
 - Google indexes Instawallet URLs after hitting Instawallet's frontpage, these wallets are usually empty
 - Some of these wallets weren't empty, this is because some people scammed other people by luring them to already exiting Instawallets by creating an HTML "a" tag with the "href" attribute pointing to a wallet, but a text displaying the root URL
 - Google also indexed URLs that were posted publicly
This has already been discussed multiple times.
So, wake your brain up (or your spine, whichever commands your mouth) and repeat after me : "Google did not magically guess URLs, Instawallet did not leak URLs, the reason I did not get a tip is not because davout is cheap, it is because I am an idiot and a whiny punk bitch".
I hope this clears it up for everyone.

I think I understand very well.
I operate an exchange since 2010, which has been the first exchange to ever become regulated, and can tell you from my experience that the biggest hurdles are regulatory, the code part is comparatively very easy.
What I'm saying is that the value proposition doesn't really make much sense if you take a cut from the trading fee.
We are in the process of licensing our platform to a third-party (in other words competing directly with bex.io and buttercoin) and the percentage cut of the trade fee has been out of question from day one.
What will happen to clients of buttercoin/bex that are successful is that they will switch to a proposition where what they pay is a flat fee, or at least something where the commission does not correlate linearly to the fees collected.
The exchange business is going to be very competitive, and the exchange-as-a-service business is going to be even more, there is an extremely low barrier to entry. Gosh, there are at least four or five open source trading platforms!
Their model does include getting regulated at some point and operate their own platform, which is probably the only part of their business model where they are going to keep making money in the long run.

LOL, this guy is obviously quite new to Bitcoin, because the first exchange to properly operate within the financial regulations framework [announced it in 2012](
Regulation is not a goal in itself, the goal is to protect the exchange, and protect its customers by segregating its funds from those of the corporation running the exchange.
It's a win-win-win.
* The exchange gets better protection
* The customer gets better protection
* Bitcoin mixes in more deeply with the system to better dissolve it from the inside
And don't even get me started with anonymity and privacy, as soon as you touch a bank *poof* it's gone.
The article is : sensationalist, factually incorrect, and its author completely fails to comprehend the bigger picture.

I don't stand for that, I'm simply saying banks don't work the way you think they do.
Once an IBAN is blacklisted at a high level it's sometimes impossible to override at a lower level. Which, if you actually think about it, makes sense because it can protect against some forms of social engineering at lower levels.
Just facts, no judgement here.

Old shit is old : 
The actual reason is way less sexier than most of you imagine, it's simply a fraud prevention measure.
Thing is, when a criminal phishes a bank account the easiest exit is to cashout at a Bitcoin exchange, and that's exactly what happens.

Yo. It's a problem with Instawallet. Not with this user.
It's all explained here : 
This person e-mailed the support stating he had a problem without giving any details letting us fix it.

Well, try it out for yourself if you want to know for sure, don't take my word for it. Do you really think Google would risk creating a massive shitstorm by publishing URLs containing stuff like session IDs et al. ?
I stand by my opinions and maintain that Instawallet is a brilliant idea, it's not my idea but I nonetheless think it's brilliant. Lots of folks will sling FUD around without thinking it through. Would you connect to your bank's website from an untrusted computer? Well, then don't visit your Instawallet from there. Would you let your computer remember your sensitive password if it's shared by many people? Well, then use incognito mode.
Instawallet is an awesome idea that rests on the very same foundation as a username/password authentication : a shared secret that you protect as best as you can and that transits encrypted over the internet.
