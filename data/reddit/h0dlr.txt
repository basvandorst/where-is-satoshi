*It is all the more wonderful to consider the glorious way in which Bitcoin has outsmarted the experts, including me. And this is precisely why I adore market forces so much. No one is in charge of them. No one can consistently outthink them. Markets keep us humble. They constantly remind us that even the most astute and prescient observer can be surprised, even shocked.*

Barely and at what cost? 
@_date: 2016-11-23 15:23:31


wouldn't OP argue that anyone who's invested $millions into mining equipment has the most motivation to understand Bitcoin &amp; do what's right for the system? In fact, couldn't it be argued that he, who has put up/risked his hard earned fiat into what heretofore has been a great success, understands Bitcoin the best? What better indicator is there? 
@_date: 2016-12-15 06:56:29
Wow, did really stoop that low? 
@_date: 2016-12-15 09:04:18
What are you talking about volunteering? 10-11 of the top contributors to core are being paid huge salaries by Blockstream. 
@_date: 2016-12-17 08:26:04
Most of the miners are producing full blocks. Lift the limit and they will build &gt;1mb blocks for the extra fees over time to offset falling rewards. 
@_date: 2016-11-23 14:36:47
I agree 
@_date: 2016-12-16 19:42:21
That's great, "I insist you're you!" 
@_date: 2016-11-25 12:21:55
I agree, the reasons for not increasing capacity are indeed political: 
@_date: 2016-11-25 15:45:03
Worse. Since political positions often involve lying about one's vested interest. one can admit to being rationally greedy and be honest about it. For instance, BU devs don't have any financial conflicts in the form of for profit companies they've set up to profit from their position. 
@_date: 2016-11-26 22:09:22
You're correct though I find it odd that you make that argument as that is one of the reasons I believe there is too much adversarial thinking devoted to this sigops attack by core dev. 
@_date: 2016-11-22 12:40:21
Such anger 
@_date: 2016-11-19 05:07:39
That's pitiful if you ask me 
@_date: 2016-11-30 19:43:44
No, I know exactly what you're talking about. I just don't agree with your characterization of it. A 3.7mb spam block world be highly disruptive and more common with SWSF since it's easier to perform since they can be merely spam . SWSF amplifies this. Since a sigops attack is purely a theoretical FUD one that's never been seen in the wild before, it's unlikely to ever happen with BU. Having said that, simple tx limits, like 100kB, would stop it in its tracks. BU is also talking about a much simpler sigops fix, either flexible tx's or parallel validation. 
@_date: 2016-12-29 18:53:45
Yeah, but his point holds. Just because you can't envision it today doesn't mean it will never happen. 
@_date: 2016-11-25 06:38:28
A 4mb block would consist of one single multi input attack tx whose signature is essentially 4mb
@_date: 2016-12-16 16:10:20
So why does everybody around here always FUD about huge uncontrollable spam blocks with BU? 
@_date: 2016-11-21 21:29:51
That there is a financial conflict of interest that he ignores. 
@_date: 2016-12-17 16:23:16
You people are fricking paranoid 
@_date: 2016-12-09 06:20:03
No you aren't. The only ones with any incentive to run full nodes for high fee high value onchain tx's will be banks. A settlement layer, remember? 
@_date: 2016-12-15 21:37:35
This is great. You're hated in your own sub. 
@_date: 2016-11-28 00:07:25
Why world I want to do that? I must remain a SW full node to fully function. 
@_date: 2016-11-21 14:26:15
Those spam attacks only began July 2015 as blocks and mempools became full. That's because it's easier and less expensive to spam in those conditions (takes less spam to fill a block or overwhelm fixed memory, and more chance that the tx rolls off the mempool w/o having to pay fee). 
@_date: 2016-12-16 16:08:00
Run all the nodes!!! 
@_date: 2016-11-28 20:33:27
The whole sigops attack case fud is purely theoretical. Never been seen before and unlikely that a miner will act to destroy his investment. 
@_date: 2016-11-25 12:24:43
 ignoring 
@_date: 2016-11-23 14:33:43
That sounds like a threat. 
@_date: 2016-12-16 16:14:44
Since when have miners "cheated" the system? even when pools like ghash, btcguild, &amp; artforz's got up to 50%, they didn't run wild doing double spends. You ought to be thanking miners for doing their jobs well over the last 7y instead of constantly modeling them as a threat and trying to redesign the system to route around them via offchain solutions. 
@_date: 2016-12-15 20:38:58
Lol how you try to make this about Roger when this reddit and its manipulation was the subject of the video.

The you for a wonderful tool from an early adopter. 
@_date: 2016-11-17 12:37:17
Nothing's changed. 
@_date: 2016-12-19 15:39:10
Yep, it's all part of core's strategy of my way or the highway attitude. For example, their insistence that big blockists have not compromised on the way down from 20 to 8 to 2mb while core has with SWSF.  lol, point to parts of SWSF that core has been forced to add that they didn't want in the debate? I saw one flippant answer to this, I think from Luke, that responded "blocksize increase". Well, if that's the case, remove the 75% discount to prove it. Because that's where the increase is coming from when you look how is applied in the code. 
Bottom line is, you're right. There's no compromise here. 
@_date: 2016-11-25 06:33:44
That says nothing except it can't 
@_date: 2016-12-16 22:29:46
That's the point. Let the miners increase the blocksize in coordination with BU full nodes. 
@_date: 2016-12-15 09:07:43
Nobody knows how to soft fork in a &gt;4800 LOC new block constructing change with a 75%discount either. 
@_date: 2016-12-16 16:16:45
BU incentivizes them to build bigger blocks to include more tx's and get more fees. 
@_date: 2016-11-27 22:40:59


That's a hypocritical argument because it's what is used to argue against simply raising the block size to the same level. 
@_date: 2016-11-28 00:18:37
Thank you for the badly needed reality check 
@_date: 2016-11-19 04:58:56
I thought this was about the community and Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2016-12-14 14:03:56
What's your real name? 
@_date: 2016-12-08 15:07:09
Again, where do you derive such certainty? One would think you invented Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-11-21 21:33:50
Again, you're committing to your own preconceived notions about what the network can handle, now and in the future. I admit, I don't know for sure, which is why I argue that both options need to be able to compete to find the truth. 
@_date: 2016-11-30 03:02:45
The sign around are only being inserted because of all the FUD spewed out by Greg &amp; core dev in their attempts to capture development and push their proprietary products. 
@_date: 2016-11-18 13:38:49
But bitfury and Ckpool have been voicing support for what, a month already? Still not ready? And no, ddos has never been a problem for core. 
@_date: 2016-11-21 15:07:53
Changing a constant is simpler from a coding standpoint compared to SWSF. I'd think you'd get that. Especially if you make maxtxsize 100kB.
Plus the network conditions that exist today are much different than back in the early days when a temporary limit was needed to prevent spam. Persistent, expensive spam today in the absence of a limit would be robust due to the economic incentives of miners to prevent this. 
@_date: 2016-11-30 03:01:15
Your scenarios made no sense. Struggling miners are going to turn around and suddenly be able to easily make attack blocks? No way. They have to be self constructed solo mined non std typically single tx attack blocks that take just as much hashing resources to make (compared to honest blocks), not to mention the losses inflicted while trying to do so, since as you said they are struggling. And it would have to be a larger miner to do it in a reasonable amount of time, not just a small struggling small miner. You forget that the economic incentive structure means that the honest larger miners are racing ahead solving blocks as a herding super majority. 
@_date: 2016-11-28 00:24:36
Why would I ever want to be a partially validating node that can't serve up the blockchain to other bootstrapping nodes? No, I will choose to remain a SW full node. Too bad i won't save on any processing or storage as has been claimed. 
@_date: 2016-12-16 13:29:18


We have been trying to tell small blockists this for years as the reason why spam blocks in a bigger block environment won't happen for many many years. 
@_date: 2016-12-08 14:55:29
Isn't that a routing problem? 
@_date: 2016-12-15 09:01:25
Maybe Roger actually has a valid gripe about trust? 
@_date: 2016-12-08 14:59:50
Many of you have made this a "technical" argument. once you cross over to monetary theory, you lose. Because, name one money in all of monetary history that started off as a settlement layer. 
@_date: 2016-11-21 22:15:51
Phones have nothing to do with this debate. They run SPV wallets and that won't change.

Says the guy who clearly hadn't read any Mises or Hayek. 
@_date: 2016-11-30 12:13:01
Like i said, we should go back to your original scenario where you were arguing *with* me that type of attack block wouldn't happen in the 3.7mb SWSF scenario because it isn't economically worthwhile to the miner to do so, lol. 
@_date: 2016-12-15 09:53:47
Since I'm talking about Bitcoin as Money and a public good, yes, I think core devs should be volunteers. Look at BU for a good example. It consists of volunteers whose code has been up and running perfectly fine for over a year now most of that time unfunded. Only recently, because of its good work and honest vision, it's been able to attract  anonymous donations. That's quite different than a for profit corporate model with equity options and incentive bonuses  funded by investor money. 
@_date: 2016-12-08 17:21:09


SWSF would be much harder to roll back and would require a hard fork as it fundamentally changes block construction and creates new address types that are ANYONECANSPEND. SWSF is &gt;4800 LOC.  BU or any blocksize increase can easily be soft forks back down to 1mb if need be since it's a simple rule restriction. 
@_date: 2016-12-16 15:58:43
Your SW tech analysis was immediately shot down by good guy johoe, who doesn't lie. Like you.

Trezor is open source. That's a big advantage. I also like that it doesn't use a proprietary secure element. 
@_date: 2016-11-24 18:03:15
Correction. They are ignoring SWSF. 
@_date: 2016-12-08 17:13:42
Your historical definitions are wrong. Gold started off as a p2p transactional system between individuals without tx fees or an overlying layer. Only with the advent of central banks and money printing did the concept of settlement system come into play with fiat as the overlay. 
@_date: 2016-12-16 16:06:26
If you're talking about BU, it's AD function will automatically cause modes to rejoin longest chain. 
As far as blocksize and concensus, blocks have always differed in a smoothly linearly rising size over 7y. 
@_date: 2016-11-18 13:36:19
No, I don't think so 
@_date: 2016-12-16 16:53:22
I knew someone would bring that up. That single episode double spend was by a rogue employee who eventually got fired. Ghash *voluntarily* and actively backed away from 51% but still rightly got deprecated by the community. Which just shows what can happen to a miner if he abuses the network with spam blocks in a BU situation. 
You also forget that SPV mining was spawned as a counter to full jacked up mempools with full blocks. Invented by Wang Chun, it was a way to get started mining on headers before completing full block tx validation. Relieve full blocks and mempools then maybe they'd stop SPV mining. 
Finally, you guys keep ignoring Antpool's pool manager's announcement that they are testing new pool logic and that this 0 tx spell is temporary .
@_date: 2016-12-08 18:26:43
That forces all current regular tx's to pay 4x that of the new SW tx's. That discount is meant to drive tx's offchain to LN hubs. That's a major change to Bitcoin and reflects an overall bearish attitude towards Bitcoin onchain itself or, IOW, what works right now for something that *may* work later. 
@_date: 2016-11-25 12:50:12
The politics on display in that article do directly influence the ability to upgrade the protocol. It's called trusting the core devs to do the right thing. Or not. 
@_date: 2016-12-17 18:22:38

@_date: 2016-12-16 22:30:30

@_date: 2016-11-24 12:22:29
Or maybe you're wrong and he's right? 
@_date: 2016-12-08 15:03:19
If fees were cheaper, it wouldn't cost so much to consolidate multi input UTXO's into one tx. 
@_date: 2016-11-22 12:42:27
Hey numptie, who set the 95% threshold again? 
@_date: 2016-11-25 12:38:07
If you read the linked article, you'll find that politics are being played by everyone, including core dev, which greatly exacerbates the problem you're afraid of  
@_date: 2016-11-25 06:30:32
What new data? 
@_date: 2016-11-25 16:21:01
You can call it what you want. Just look at the details of what's going on and it's clear. 
@_date: 2016-12-08 17:42:45
Core doesn't have 100+ devs. They even include Gavin and Jeff on that list. No, they're more like 10-15.
@_date: 2016-12-15 15:50:50
Their pool manager came on the other day and said they are testing new pool logic. Takes time, no biggie. 
@_date: 2016-12-09 00:42:59
And you sound like you don't understand Bitcoin. For 7y, Bitcoin has had no effective cap so why haven't we had 1mb blocks the whole time? 
@_date: 2016-12-08 17:14:21
Not compared to SW tx's 
@_date: 2016-12-16 17:49:23

Yes, we're pulling a Hillary here 
@_date: 2016-11-28 00:20:41
Great info! 
@_date: 2016-11-29 10:08:28
Lol, now you're really reaching. Any miner in that situation still has the incentive to move for coins that have the potential to go to the moon in value due to its fixed supply. Which is easy more than his hope of attentive to attack the network mining a sigops block and bring able to muster enough money to short bitcoin on an exchange which he'd probably never be able to get out in real terms. 
See? Now you're arguing against the other side of your mouth, lol. 
@_date: 2016-11-21 23:18:28
Not when most users use SPV wallets 
@_date: 2016-12-16 13:26:22

Instead of installing one of those Tesla PowerWalls, might as well put in a Bitcoin ATM. 
@_date: 2016-11-24 14:59:32
Huh? Miners are not limiting the amount of fee. It's the blocksize cap forcing too high of fees. 
@_date: 2016-12-08 15:40:32
Not through your soft fork mechanism since you have to disadvantage regular tx's through cost to do it. 
@_date: 2016-12-16 17:48:38
Who's cypherdoc? I heard he's a legend. 
Johoe knows what he's taking about, lol. 
@_date: 2016-12-30 06:54:07
I don't think miners are as corrupt as those coming up with a scheme like that. 
@_date: 2016-12-15 15:26:06
To pretend that their employer, especially at this relatively early period in Bitcoin history, has not or would not want to influence the protocol to their own benefit is naive at best. 
And yes, since people are motivated by philanthropy to make the world a better place. The BU devs are like that. They never went into the project asking for money nor engaging in any for profit companies. They merely have coins, as early adopters, that they want to make more valuable as well as help create a new revolutionary new form of money. They will go down in history as freedom fighters. 
@_date: 2016-12-08 17:17:18
Seems you misunderstand the big block argument *still* to this day. I don't claim I know either so my solution is to open up both onchain and offchain development channels and let them compete. Unlimited vs SW. If SW is so much better, what are you afraid of? 
@_date: 2016-12-15 20:05:27
You sound tough 
@_date: 2016-12-30 06:51:40
Sure, where's your proof? 
@_date: 2016-12-08 14:51:59


@_date: 2016-12-23 16:50:41
I think that's true. It'll be more of a niche item 
@_date: 2016-12-09 00:14:24
Because I don't believe core dev should be driving anything. Nor should BU. If they were honest, core dev would let the two solutions compete by removing the limit. 
@_date: 2016-11-21 14:04:46
If you're so confident about your scenario, remove the limit and let the two options compete. If LN is as great as you claim, it should be chosen freely by all Bitcoiners  right? 
@_date: 2016-11-19 04:56:47
Removing the limit is not putting everything in hands of miners. If they don't please users, nodes, and merchants, everybody just leaves and price goes to zero. And miners don't want that coz of millions invested in HW. 
@_date: 2016-12-16 22:31:33
They publicly promised to cut their hashrate back and they did. They still got punished. 
@_date: 2016-11-21 20:39:40
What you are claiming might be true if you weren't seen to be pushing offchain solutions (SC's &amp; LN) that compete with onchain scaling. But you are. 
@_date: 2016-12-16 16:18:26
It's not. Core is pretending it is. 
@_date: 2016-11-23 14:56:29
But that's OP's point. He doesn't think core dev, who controls how the protocol works, is representing users. 
@_date: 2016-12-19 20:01:25
Then take out the discount 
@_date: 2016-11-21 14:07:13
If malleability is so important of am issue to fix, removing the limit won't make any difference as the community should overwhelmingly choose SW enabled LN, right? 
@_date: 2016-11-23 22:15:54
I thought this was strictly a technical problem, not an economic one? 
@_date: 2016-12-16 13:20:55
Yeah sure. Aren't you  the one who wrote that ridiculous blog piece? 
@_date: 2016-11-24 15:12:12
Because the 1mb cap forces them to order the acceptance of only the highest paying tx's. There's only so much space in a block. 
@_date: 2016-12-14 15:47:07
Stop using socks 
@_date: 2016-12-14 10:48:28
No, he has an infinite capacity for denial in the face of reality 
@_date: 2016-12-16 13:18:27
Yes they are, really. Otherwise, you are an authoritarian. 
And btw, blocksize is not and has never been a consensus parameter. 
@_date: 2016-11-21 14:41:25
please explain how that follows. The onset of those spam attacks could also just mean that a simple blocksize limit increase could be the solution. 
@_date: 2016-11-29 21:41:59
And this is where I can tell you don't understand Bitcoin. What you try to  portray as a weakness by accusing me of depending on "trust ", is actually an "understanding" that miners will act in their own best interest in NOT attacking the network with these never been seen before sigops attack blocks. You said it yourself but won't admit your waffling back and forth depending on your argument. As Lopp said: "One of the greatest assumptions made by bitcoin’s security model is that the majority of miners are honest – that they are working to secure the blockchain rather than attempting to undermine it." 
@_date: 2016-11-19 14:36:56
Nope
