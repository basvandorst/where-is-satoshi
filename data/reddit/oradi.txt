That's what I'm doing mostly. I'll sit on what I have through the holidays then sell and cash out. 
Got burned on bitgrail, everything I bought tanked, and the amount of pump a dump invites I get invited to is annoying.

I sort of get it... People start getting paid out bonuses and then realize where they stuck some money last year when the big boom happened. "Let me see what crypto is up to"

Hope you're taking questions. If not maybe someone in the community knows?
I think this is a really awesome idea and definitely something that interests me. That being said, being paid solely in bitcoin kind of scares me. Why wouldn't I just get paid normally and then convert it over? Sorry if this is a dumb question, still kind of new to the bitcoin world.

Lots of grocery deliveries going on in the bay area still. 
I've actually been considering going back to it as, even with the delivery fee, I tend to spend less money overall because there's no impulse buying going on. 
Only downside is I can't pick the exact produce or meat I want. Great for pre-packaged stuff but I try to avoid that.

It's this easy? Manually transferring is a pain but I always thought it was a necessary evil since getting my employer to pay me in multiple ways is a pipe dream . 
Will definitely have to look into it more then. Does anyone here have any experience with the Bitwage platform?
