That's interesting. How would a merchant recognize that a particular transaction had been signed by GreenAddress? Would this be out-of-band information?

I feel like that represents a loss to the network-effect awareness needed to promote btc as the *currency of the internet*.

Why rely on tipbots rather than proudly flaunting a btc address as a post signature on reddit?

Does Mycelium have support for sending from a specific bitcoin address (instead of any address in the wallet/account)?

This kind of shit drives me nuts. You have fully empowered them to commit identity fraud, and received no valuable service in return.
If you have any lawyer friends then get them to write a nasty (legally speaking) letter and threaten to sue for breach of (collateral) contract and lack of performance. You provided details in consideration for using their bitcoin funds service. Even if it goes nowhere - you at least get to waste the time of their legal department for a few hours and have a chain of documentation if anything more serious did happen.

What's your reason for this?

This is what sold me on blockchain.info.

What are the complaints regarding btc-e ?

Are other finance students interested it bitcoin? Have lecturers ever mentioned it in classes/tutes?

What is the advantage of allowing an external party hold a private key over your account? 
Doesn't it just mean they can prevent you moving bitcoin, if they're subject to a court order or bankruptcy proceeding etc?.

Of course it helps! Whenever AMazon key decision makers discuss it formally or otherwise, there exits another piece of evidence that can be drawn upon, pointing to consumer demand.
Also it's ironic - that after signing the petition, they have an option to sponsor the motion for a nominal amount from $10-$50. 
How many more people would contribute if they offered a simple bitcoin address textfiled, instead of requiring the user to submit their credit card details!

I've spent the last week learning about and buying bitcoin. A few questions:
* For someone running bitcoin-qt, it exposes their ip publicly as a bitcoin node. Surely this presents a risk for zero-day exploits (eg buffer-overruns) leading to possible compromise of the wallet.dat?  
* Anywhere to buy commodities/equities with btc? If not, then is it possible to purchase exposure to these markets in btc (like a futures market). Is this the goal of projects like counterparty xpc?
* Apart from blockchain charts, I've been looking at Google trends for use of 'bitcoin'. Any other searchtools that track usage of bitcoin terminology? For example on sites like facebook or reddit to help guage adoption?
* With a 21 million float - how many btc have already been lost?
* Double spend verification is slow. 20mins compared with cash, atm, paypal - is this a problem for retail useage? If I increase the miner fees/incentive to say $1 - how fast will it be processed?
* Are there POS devices using QR codes for bc available?
A+ thanks!

find exchange -&gt; register and proof of identity -&gt; swift transfer -&gt; and you have an efficient market with enough depth to buy/sell qty.

A good analogy is that the Blockchain is like a transport protocol stack. eg. http embedded in tcp in ethernet frames.

There's some confusion arising about the terminology of a 'peg' which is being used in two entirely different contexts.
In a typical central-bank managed currency peg, the central-bank holds the currency to some proxy target (by manipulating interest rates) against the natural market equilibrium price. If the central bank stops intervening then the price reverts to equilibrium. Examples are the recent Swiss Franc appreciation or George Soro's famous bet against the BOE.
For a 'pegged' asset like bitUSD, it's the market itself that sustains the peg, and not some dominant central actor. It's similar to the way a futures contract will track the underlying spot price of an asset with small deviations for frictional costs, and the opportunity cost of lost interest earnings.

short term traders do, so they can catch the next pump. for someone that believes in the long-term proposition of bit-assets they would withdraw to wallet/cold storage same as for bitcoin.

If dpos is evidence, then blockchains can redirect the heat they generate as a mining by-product, into something more valuable to society.

Thanks for the explanation.

Hi, I know this is old, and I upvoted you, as you actually know swift. 
I understand that the swift message represents the fast electronic authorization, but I'm struggling to understand how the settlement process works.
Does settlement with swift involve corresponding movement of physical currency, or a mailed bank check, or money-market bonds or something to credit the destination bank? 
How would it work for a USD swift wire-transfer from a US bank branch to an Asian branch for instance?

What is the advantage of constructing the aggregated tx hash using merkle ordering versus simply hashing the txs in the same sequence as they are incorporated in the block?  I believe it may be SPV related but not sure?
