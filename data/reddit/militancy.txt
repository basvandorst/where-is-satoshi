The get rich quick scheme part is where weak hands get scared by the new low price. The gamble is if you can buy more at a better price  before the panic stops. Worst case scenario is price recovery before you can buy back in.

Technically yes, and it was profitable in ye olden days, but is now comically unprofitable. Dedicated hardware (ASICs) has been developed that, in short, makes your home computer look like an abacus for the purpose of mining Bitcoin.
Mining on consumer hardware is still possible with a number of other cryptocurrencies because they were intentionally designed to make ASICs prohibitvely expensive and/or have little gain over consumer hardware. The intent of this is to prevent centralization of mining resources by allowing any relatively modern computer be a relevant mining tool. However, there are downsides to this as can be seen in Monero, where botnets wielding a huge number of computers are beginning to make up a large percentage of the network hashrate. Asic resistance as a means of decentralization lead straight back into centralization.
