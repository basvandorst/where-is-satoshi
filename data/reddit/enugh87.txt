What do you think Asia will do? BTC up or down before the futures? My bet is a major correction around 11k.

I'm not letting anyone influence anything to my opinion, I just wanted to point of view from someone envolved with the subject. I'm thinking and doing my analysis from the point of view of mass psychology and the probabilities in each scenario taking in consideration the facts and not the rumors neither the speculation or expectations.
The facts I wanted to clear and confirm were: Early adopters are geeks that understands the tech, also geeks that loved the concept, also geeks that only bought it for gaming... Those geeks (I´m kind of one too) are the ones that I'm trying to think alike, not because what bitcoin is or its future, but because the can crash the market again if they build an entire sell-off.

Yes I think the same but my brain makes me remember people are greedy, that is why I think option 2 is the most realistic one, that is why an opinion from those early adopters would calirfy a lot the sentiment and set us ready for the reallity. 
The facts I see are: 
Those early adopters are geeks who bought it for the tech or for gaming.
Either way, they have had 4 years to learn and see BTC booming and crashing hard and they now know btc has a lot of room of growth, they should be wise by now.
Their profiles if they are geeks indicates that they don't care much about the money but the tech is their goal.
If they are gammers, they care more about the money but also the tech, so thy are the ones that would sell more of their portions but they are greedy and have being in the market long enough to hold the majority.
Just a few will sell the majority and hold a small portion.
Either the case, the FUD around MtGox should be shutting down within the next weeks, now we need google and FB adds and the ETFs!! 
That is my gut =)

Wow, thanks for the answer, that clears my vision a little bit

Let's be clear, these are great news because it means they (MtGox) are not going to sell again, but once MtGox gives back the BTCs to their owners, what would happen?
1. Owners will sell to take profits - They bought really really cheap so they are holding large ammounts, they could be millionares
2. Owners will sell only a portion and wait fot 20K again to sell again higher.
3. Owners will hold and wait fot BTC to get to \~20K or new ATH to sell.
Any thoughts?

It will take some time tho... For people to hear and react about this, will take a few days and for us to go back to ATH will be needed the help of facebook and google adds to get again to massive attention and atract new buyers. Also we are waiting for the ETFs, but again, it will take several months and an accumulation phase end =)

Could anyone explain to me in regular words the meaning of this post of him? English is not my first language and I just got confused.
This post means Gox will sell anothder 160k BTC and then reimburse investors with fiat? Or Gox will reimburse 160k BTC to investors (in BTC)?
What is the outcome from all this Gox tragedy in a less technical English?
