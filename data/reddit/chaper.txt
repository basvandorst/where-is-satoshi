Didn't know Gary Busey had surgery and went to work at the IMF.   
Fair play to him.

I believe it's a typo in the first mention. Coinrail was meant to be written.   
They mention Coincheck as an example of hacks that happened in the past. So their use of it is perfectly legit.

No human interaction means more robustness indeed. I've 'ever heard of problems with slots and other such games of luck. Poker is a different beast as superuser have been a problem in the past but random number generator hasn't been caught acting up AFAIK

I'd believe that, if fairness was at the heart of gamblers, online gambling would be clean and proven clean since day one. That being said, i don't believe much online gambling is shady. I'm thinking that most of it is actually legit as far as odds and payouts are concerned.  
Withdrawal issues, and otehr such things are not. But the math checks out. Management is a different topic.
