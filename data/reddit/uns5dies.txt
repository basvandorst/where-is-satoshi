"He claims 10 percent of his net worth is now invested in cryptocurrency."
I'm sure the average redditor here is way above this. Not a true HODLER just a random GAMBLER

When I was a teenager I asked my mum if I could plant marijuana in our garden. She refused. Then I said that otherwise I would have no choice than to buy it to dangerous people and that it might be toxic or adulterated. Well, you can replace marijuana for bitcoin and say that if they refuse you'll have to meet someone in person through local bitcoins and they could steal the money from you so they have no choice to help you buy it with your OWN money and send it to the address you want.

just try to be nice but persuasive, I actually think I was right when I was telling this to my mum and finally she agreed with the condition that I will keep up with the good school grades. If you are thinking already in investing in bitcoin I assume you have good grades too so just try to tell your parents you know what you are doing and you are rationally aware of the dangers of this kind of investment.

This comment is more inspirational than your original post. It's great that we are moving to a more free society where everyone could chose their own  path.

Seriously why you guys even hold coins in the first place if you are afraid government will find out. Wasn't this all about some independency from the "system"? The more I read about these tax posts about people wanting to cash out the more hopeless I feel for bitcoin. Satoshi must be turning in his grave... oh wait
