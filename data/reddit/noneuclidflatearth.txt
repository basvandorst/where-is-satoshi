Bitcoin is volatile and illiquid.  The only real use cases I can see are 
* Move money out of oppressive regimes without having to purchase physical goods
* Speculation

You're just young and have no idea what an actual economic collapse looks like. The great recession was nothing compared to the booms and busts of the gold standard era. It's not your fault that you haven't experienced these, but it is your fault that you haven't studied them if you're going to be a Bitcoin evangelist. Control of the money supply IS an extremely important tool. I understand the desire to get the humans out of control of money, but money is a human invention. It has to be managed. A better thing to do is to try to bring as much transparency as possible to that process rather than abandoning it all together.
@_date: 2018-11-23 21:49:06
Centralized or decentralized control doesn't really matter as much as the market demand for a currency. When deflation hits, demand for a currency skyrockets, causing more deflation in a viscious cycle. Credit markets seize, because no one wants to give out loans. After all, they are getting a high rate of return just holding currency. Why would they choose to invest in anything? 
This is the exact scenario we saw with gold when counties were on the gold standard. After all, gold wasn't run by a central authority either. 
 Inflation is bad, deflation is even worse. The ideal inflation target is 0, but 2 or 3 percent is more appropriate to prevent slipping into deflation. The central banks of the world have done a pretty fair job of preventing economic collapse. There's no way gold or Bitcoin could ever do better.
@_date: 2018-11-27 22:59:38
Bitcoin's overhead is about the same or more than cash.  So what's the point?
Also, you have to pay your taxes.  That's how society works.  If you purchase things with bitcoin to dodge taxes, then you're freeloading off of the taxes of others.  It's just stealing by another name.
@_date: 2018-11-26 03:05:58
Right but if that happened they would be 0 though.
@_date: 2018-11-23 15:24:08
Deflation collapses economies. Why would anyone ever want that?

Oh those 1s and 0s aren't made out of thin air. It takes the energy of a small country to produce those!
@_date: 2018-11-27 20:09:24


It's not though, because purchasing things is only one small piece of being an effective currency.  A currency must also be a mechanism of debt, so people must be willing to take out loans or initiate contractual obligations in the currency.  Nobody in their right mind would take out a loan (like a mortgage) in bitcoin, it's far too volatile.  Similarly, nobody is going to sign a rental agreement in bitcoin.  Imagine if you agreed to pay .5 bitcoin every month in rent.  Some months the renter would be bankrupt, other months the property owner would be bankrupt.  And there's no good way to know who it'll be.
Also, bitcoin is only taken by starbucks because hardly anyone uses it (if 10 people used bitcoin at the same time it would hold up the line to a massive degree) and there is a middleman (that gets a cut of the proceeds) handling the transaction for them.  Bitcoin was supposed to be fast and low cost.  It is neither.

What you're talking about is not really a currency then, it's a commodity.  Which seems reasonable, bitcoin can be a commodity for some specific use cases.
I just don't think its going to take over the world, or ever be anything other than a tiny little side-show.
@_date: 2018-11-27 20:11:31


That's true, but how can the even more severe boom and busts of the gold standard be accounted for?  Doesn't it seem like the federal reserve system is less bad?
EDIT:  I should clarify, I'm also worried about government debt.  But that can happen with or without a gold standard.
@_date: 2018-11-25 06:30:55
Probably not, but for a few Bitcoin I'd consider it.
@_date: 2018-11-23 02:20:25
That's what I'd say too if I was about to lose everything on Bitcoin speculation....
@_date: 2018-11-25 02:48:24
1 BTC will be worth 500,000$ by the end of 2019. Guaranteed.
@_date: 2018-11-27 19:16:02
But doesn't that add extra cost?  You have to pay the middleman, and that's on top of paying the miners to get the transactions processed.
One of the big selling points of bitcoin was the low cost per transaction, but that seems to be rapidly evaporating.
@_date: 2018-11-27 15:57:57
I guess, but fees on cash are 0.  My last cash transfer took 10 seconds.  I just handed the cash to the person I was buying something from.
Also, this whole "redditor for 2 months" thing is an ad hominem attack, which is a logical fallacy.  You're attacking me personally as a way to discredit my arguments.  The person making an ad hominem attack usually does so out of desperation, knowing they have the weaker argument.
@_date: 2018-11-23 19:41:28
Your response indicates you have very little historical understanding of how money works. Study the great depression and the recessions from the 1800s, it will help you understand how money works.
@_date: 2018-11-26 03:06:53
And this is how the scheme works!
@_date: 2018-11-27 14:32:22
I mean, it's a better currency than Venezuelan Boulivars, but definitely not better than dollars, pounds or euros.  Only 500 transactions globally per minute, takes hours to complete, requires paying a fee for every transaction, doesn't work without the internet, consumes inordinate amounts of resources to process...  What about it is better than fiat currency?
@_date: 2018-11-28 16:20:41
lol. ok.  bitcoin is good for taxes, but it isn't.  its low cost to transfer, except it isn't.  its fast, but fast is 6 minutes at best.
you're a zealot, probably because you have too much invested to see clearly.  good luck!

We had that system once, it was called the gold system.  It fell apart in the 1920's and caused the worst economic depression in modern history.  Why would we want that again?
@_date: 2018-11-27 19:14:09


Right, but I can plan for this by investing my money in stocks or bonds.  Dollars may depreciate 2 to 3 percent in a YEAR, bitcoin can do quadruple that in an hour.  Stability is a desired trait of a currency.  Bitcoin doesn't have any stability at all, ergo it is a poor currency.


I'm not a shill, except maybe for cadbury creme eggs. I will never not eat a cadbury creme egg when I have the opportunity... As to bitcoin, I just like economics and bitcoin is a fascinating, contained piece of economics.  I believe it's foundationally unsound as a currency, but it's fun to watch the attempt.  I think that bitcoin is acting a raw commodity at this point.  A commodity detached from any underlying intrinsic value outside of contractual ownership.  It's like an academic experiment, but for real money.
@_date: 2018-11-27 20:15:02


Am I though?
@_date: 2018-11-27 21:20:02
Low cost. Cash is no cost. Try again.
@_date: 2018-11-26 03:04:17
For sure. How much were you able to buy?
@_date: 2018-11-27 20:25:07


Not really though.  A cash transaction can be as simple as handing money from one person to another.


Not true. The lightning network requires a 3rd party clearinghouse to post transactions back, which does cost a fee.  It may be to a clearinghouse and not a bank, but a fee is a fee.


Everyone can see all transactions by everyone for all time.  That IS the blockchain.  The only anonymity you have is that someone may not know that your wallet ID belongs to you, and the lightning network may partially obscure some transactions.  The feds already have a blockchain aggregation tool they can use once they have your wallet ID to draw a map of all of your bitcoin spending.  My bank may tell SOME people about my spending.  Bitcoin tells EVERYONE.


Jury is still out on that one.  Even if it does, a deflationary currency is a terrible currency.
@_date: 2018-11-23 04:54:46
The real test of a currency is whether or not you'd take out a loan or schedule a recurring payment in that currency. Imagine the havoc if peoples mortgages we're in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-12-12 17:52:29
That's a fair point.  In Western countries the banks are secure, but good luck if you live in South America, Africa, etc...

@_date: 2018-12-28 03:04:58
Good old FDIC.
@_date: 2018-12-19 04:49:50
So why are people using exchanges?  Isn't it totally unnecessary?
@_date: 2018-12-12 21:38:52
Bitcoin isn't going to solve boom/bust.  If anything, it'll make it worse.  Just like gold did back in the 30's.  Currency begins to deflate, causing people to forgo spending and seek to hold currency, which makes the currency deflate even more, and on and on.  This was a fundamental problem in the great depression, and will be a fundamental problem with any currency system that has a fixed supply but elastic demand.
@_date: 2018-12-26 15:55:07
For a technology that is supposed to have super low transaction fees, bitcoin sure has high transaction fees.
@_date: 2018-12-14 05:07:58
Sure, if you timed it perfectly, you could have done very well.  Just like tulip bulbs or collateralized debt obligations.

@_date: 2018-12-20 04:48:11
My plan is to buy lots of Bitcoin and store them in a large vault. Then I will print paper notes in reasonable denominations that can be transferred easily from one person to another offline. This way you can simply give the proper amount of these notes to the shopkeeper in exchange for the item. If a person chooses, they can redeem these paper notes at my storefront for the Bitcoin in the vault.  Of course, it is highly unlikely that all the notes in circulation will be redeemed at once so I can probably print more notes than I actually have to increase liquidity.... Ahh shit. I accidentally reinvented fractional reserve banking.

Totally agree. That dottering old fool just Mr. Magooed his way to success consistently over 60 years. Anybody could probably do that. Bitcoin investors are basically an intellectually superior equivalent, and sure they may be down 50 to 80 percent right now, but within the next 5 years Bitcoin will replace all fiat currency and each Bitcoin will be worth millions of dollars! Maybe billions! A new ruling class of Bitcoin elites will reign supreme in a glorious libertarian future. Wars? Economic crises? Impotency? All will cured by the soothing salve of Bitcoin, smoothly ushered in by a new aristocracy of crypto-anarchistic philosopher Kings. Warren Buffett will be a footnote in a history book no one reads.

But it's much easier to rob someone of their bitcoin because it ISN'T in a bank.  Simply get the wallet ID and you lose everything.  Illicit exchanges and hackers have wreaked havoc.  And that's not even counting cases where people lose their wallet IDs because of disk drive failures, house fires, etc...
A huge number of people's bitcoin has been lost or stolen, and there isn't a good way to get it back.  I feel 100 times more secure about the money I have in the bank than my cryptocurrency.

In fifty years the kids of our kids will be asking us why we didn't invest in "the next big thing", but nobody is going to say, "Hey, Grandpa, you sure were smart to not sink all your savings into dogecoin."

Do you think that people may not trust themselves to be able to safeguard their keys? 
People use banks rather than gun safes to store their retirement savings because if the bank loses your money they are insured and legally liable to get your money back, where if your gun safe is robbed there is no such legal recourse. Is this a legitimate service in the Bitcoin space? Should people be able to outsource the holding of their Bitcoin for a small fee in order to have legal recourse were it lost or stolen from that institution?
@_date: 2018-12-12 23:40:26

A Wallet ID (also called your Wallet Identifier) acts similarly to a username you'd use to access your email, or log into Facebook. To log into your wallet, you'd use your Wallet ID, password, plus any form of Two Factor Authentication you've enabled.
It looks like a string of letters and numbers, like the sample Wallet ID below:
A Wallet ID is only used for the login process, and it's different from a bitcoin address. In other words, it can't be used to send or receive funds. For security reasons, we strongly recommend you don't share your Wallet ID publicly, or with anyone.

Haha, yeah, they'll be like, "Geez dad!  All you have to do is integrate your car with your bitcoin wallet and route that through the quantum computing subnet - then the carwash door will open.  Wow.  Do you old people even understand anything?!?!"

I just wanted to say "thank you for using a logarithmic chart starting at 50 dollars and not .5 pennies."

Did you try to offer them bitcoin?

Couldn't those places simply act as a clearinghouse, negotiating the purchasing and selling of bitcoin between two private parties without holding onto the bitcoin in the middle?
Isn't your wallet your "bank account"?  Can't the bitcoin be deposited there directly without any long-term holding in the middle?  (Or even the ability to for the middleman to hold long term?)

how is bitcoin a stable investment again?  i don't get it.  
incidentally, shouldn't "dow jones" be replaced with "s&amp;p 500"?  the dow is only 30 companies, with really wonky price weighting.

You are not forming coherent sentences.

Certainly possible, but the odds that my bitcoin will be irrevocably stolen are lots higher than the funds in my bank account.

Of course governments love Bitcoin, it allows unprecedented traceability of transactions. The government could know nearly everything about you with your entire transaction history on public record.
