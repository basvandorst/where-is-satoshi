you are absolutely brilliant. I am so sorry that your brilliant beautiful mind is stuck in this century, you were obviously meant for a different (more advanced time). You must have a really hard time being surrounded by people who don’t understand your brilliance or appreciate the true amazing-ness of your code. I am blown away by you, keep up the incredible work bro. There ARE people who appreciate You
