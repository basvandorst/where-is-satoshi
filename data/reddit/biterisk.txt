As long as you're okay with losing what you have in. That's really important as well.
I first bought in when it was just above $10k last week. I literally almost cried when it dipped to below 9k. I started panicking and wondered if I should sell now before I lost everything.. but then I just held. I decided I was going to be more upset if it went back up after I sold. I'm glad I held right now, though I'm still ready to lose it all.

You can't beat yourself up over it. My husband was mining bitcoin years ago and I wasn't supportive because we weren't paying for the electricity and I didn't understand it. Then he used his last bitcoin to buy a graphics card on newegg thinking it hit it's peak. I hate myself for not researching it back then and looking for more ethical ways of going about it. But honestly we would have probably sold early and been even closer to being comfortable, yet not. Haha, it's just life. You can't know the future.
It's just not worth dwelling on. Buy in now if you'd like and can. The reason I bought in now is because it was killing me that we missed out and I decided I wanted a small piece of it at least.

I just want to see it break 14.4k before bed. :(

Awesome! Good for you. :) You planning on hodling?

You should be okay in the long run.. but remember, don't put in what you're not willing to lose.

They're working on it. :D

Apparently whenever I buy in, it dips right after. So I'll let you know the next time that I buy.

Aren't you sweet. :P

Wow, truly incredible. Congratulations to him! I'm sure he'll put it to good use, especially considering how highly he is spoken of around here. I can't imagine the gratitude he must be feeling right now.

I've been watching gdax.com.

Good luck to you - and thus all of us!
I just bought in last week. Then a dip happened and I was losing my money.. fast. I started to panic and wondered if I made a huge mistake. I thought about selling at a loss because I thought Bitcoin was crashing before my eyes. I thought I joined too late, but I resisted and didn't sell. Now I'm a few hundred richer, haha.
Stick with it during the highs and lows, if you can! It's definitely a roller coaster, but I personally believe in it. Just a little bit of advice from my experience so far. :)

Well, next time I'll let you know when my buy urge is overpoweringly strong and then you'll know when to sell in preparation for the dip. :P Seems fool proof so far. I agonized over when to put $50 in tonight and seriously 5 minutes later after going in at around ~14,350... it dipped down to below 14k. Not significant with that amount, but still annoying.
I'm just going to keep hodling myself. I couldn't put enough in it to bother trying to sell and rebuy.. too risky that I'll get left behind and not be able to get back in.
