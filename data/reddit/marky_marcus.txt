How much privacy does "our identity" have left anyway?
The NSA spying/data collecting has been as bad or worse than anyone expected. Also, the IRS was caught taking a close look at the tax returns of people who belong to certain political groups, and people get fired from their job for certain types of donations.

I personally think they are all gone. 
I mean imagine, you are in your house making a new currency FFS.  Just thinking that in 2008, 2009 must have been like thinking you are going to make a paper airplane out of a safety deposit box! Like, this is never gonna fly!  Meanwhile you're mining thousands of BTC a week oh bunch of random hardware. Are you gonna back up your keys? I wouldn't. I mean come on.. this is just a game right? a proof of concept. It's not like it's going to be worth BILLIONS! who knows how many times Satoshi had to reinstall linux or replace his hard drive on his miners when BTC was zero dollars! You have to pay someone to take your coins. Are you gonna waste your time backing up keys? 
so yea.. I say they are all gone to bittie heaven.

This same ATM was at the Texas Bitcoin Conference the week before SXSW.  I used this very machine.
As the video shows, there are two steps to exchanging Bitcoin and Fiat in any bank or money exchange setting.
1.  Verifying identity and KYC/AML registration.
2.  Exchanging fiat &amp; BTC.
This vending machine lets both processes take place.  The registration is, of course, tedious no matter where you go.
At this vending machine, the one time registration consisted of inserting my (TX) driver's license, my palm print, a scan of my eyes, and giving a phone number.  The machine thanked me, and said it would give a txt message when I was approved.  It took about a minute for that to complete.
I went to the back of the line, and when I got back to the front, I said I wanted to buy bitcoin.  I put my palm in the machine, inserted a $10 bill, and it printed out a QR code with a brand new address and private key.  A very precious piece of paper that presents a security concern until I move the funds elsewhere.  I'm sure the cell phone got involved somehow, but I don't remember that.  I have a blackberry, not an Android, and I wanted a paper receipt.
I assume that I can now go to any ATM in that network, insert my palm, and do a transaction.  
Ahem.  I always include the miner's fee.

It would be cool if they did. I would actually consider using Ebay again. 
As an old football coach of mine used to say "I see better than I hear."

That would be utterly insane if he had anything pertaining to his private keys stored in his inbox.   That would be serious bad news...

It is a familiar denomination. Changing the way we think about something takes time. Many of us all ready take losses when we transact business because we pay exchange fees to top off our stash when we spend bit coin.

Bad prediction for this company and the holders of bitcoin at MtGox. That's the most exciting topic in bitcoin world. 
@_date: 2014-06-15 07:52:36
Great effort. Two students able to rise half million for good cause. The more and more bitcoin acceptance is good for bitcoin community.

So, I knew about Bitcoin since 2011, but I didn't catch the train on time.
I'm back now, bought some, but recently I decided to try to mine and see if it's worth it.
Now, damn me and when I use my brain after my hands.

Well this is true for any money transmitter, and considering the size of the paypal network I have a good feeling that they will know how to comply with all applicable laws (and if they don't already, they can sure afford the lawyers to figure it all out).
Hopefully paypal will allow people to accept bitcoin and add bitcoin as an alternative currency in their account (much like international seller accounts) with an option to turn that bitcoin into whatever currency they like for a fee. That way in the beginning people can accept bitcoin and turn it into fiat if they wish. Then little by little as they deal more and more in bitcoin they will just keep the bitcoin balances in their account so that they can bypass the fiat exchange fee.

This outta be an interesting report.   I think you would get some better traction around here if you charged less though...

That's the time to make new charts as there's nothing clear with MtGox. Only lots of predictions based on feelings and a little bit of information.
@_date: 2014-02-16 07:39:46
That's as difficult to answer as it is difficult to predict what will happen with this company. there are different vista on it.

The stories of young bitcoin millionaires might be fun and exciting if they are true. 
In reality, people who are actually rich might be smart to keep quiet (for better security), and people willing to claim they have great riches could be embellishing their status just to get attention.

That's a good news, finally we can buy more merchandise online and offline..without cashing out BTC

A lot of big retailers have started accepting Bitcoin but at the same time not many new avenues for purchasing Bitcoin have appeared.

Bitcoin is not anonymous either (despite many "news" stories claiming it is)
I value privacy, but for me it's probably too late to really matter much.
Who has an identity that is currently worth more than $10?

This guy is confused about what bitcoin is and Gox was - bitcoin is not Gox. Is ach unsafe because a bank was robbed or someone's identify stolen?
He also mixes up the meaning of "unstable" and comparing price with the protocol. If he is talking dollar value stagily he's sadly very mistaken there too.
There are many more issues with this 'expert' and in short Boston Univ should be embarrassed to have their expert so uninformed.

Love the idea -- once I work through the entire whitepaper I'll get back with some feedback.
@_date: 2014-06-29 16:33:38
Western Union would include bitcoins if they were "regulated"

Very constructive post about altcoins. I also meet many people who are against altcoins and even think alcoins heart bitcoin's reputation but no arguments at all just yelling 'alctoins are bad' 
Futhermore, I think there would be some leaders in alts and many other small alts, but all of them would take their own place or die. Both is quite good. 
More interesting to predict who's gonna be the leader?!
Nowadays, I see Bytecoin (bcn) and some other alts prospective. What do you think?
