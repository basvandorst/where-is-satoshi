Not to be a downer but i seriously doubt this will be worth much when he goes to college. Bitcoins a bubble, it'll pop and the price will go down to a somewhat consistent price after people quit speculatively buying it. 90 percent of the traffic of Bitcoin now is people that have no intention of using   it as a currency or ever using it instead of the USD they all just buy it in the hopes of selling for a higher price and not every one can do that.

IMO gold is highly divisible and secure.

They have to have cash in them no matter what incase someone wants to sell their bitcoins.

If bitcoin ever crashes and becomes worth a few dollars a bitcoin I’m sure you’ll be very happy that its unconfiscatable.

One of two possibilities happened either this guy was an idiot or most people wildly underestimate the impact the fax machine had

That he doesn’t exist and this is just fabricated to make people feel less insecure about their bitcoin purchase?

He could use a different name to lure them into another in person transaction and bring the police with him to bust the scammers

Maybe if you assume a different name online you could either trick them into thinking you are someone else trying to sell bitcoin to them and bring the cops with you to the meeting or convince them you want to pay cash for their bitcoin and bring the cops, there scam is irrelevant if they can’t cash it out some how

In all reality it really is bitcoins problem because when people hear about an unregulated currency that is being used for money laundering it scares them away, even if it just as easy to launder traditional  money just the thought that there is something in place to prevent it makes people feel safer using it

Then what is the whole purpose? If it never works out as a currency then crypto is the worst investment imaginable unless your trying to make your money before the bubble pops, and yes crypto is a bubble, the only thing that keeps it from being a bubble is the possibility of it being a real usable currency  someday.

Everyone should be spending crypto everywhere they can other wise well all be stuck with valueless imaginary money ultimately if everyone buys it to hodl then eventually noone will want it

Yes butmy point is that if its just a store of value for too long then in a few years it will technically store your value but will be nearly impossible to liquidate.
