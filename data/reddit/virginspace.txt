I fully agree with you that Bitcoin is so much more but this thread and your original comment is leaning more towards speculating its price to fiat which you were passing off as advice. Not so much about the grand ideas and the inevitable destiny of Bitcoin. 
If you genuinely believe that particular single sentence is an indicator of incompetence and is irrelevant to the discussion to Bitcoin, I don’t think this conversation will get far at all. 
I realise my initial comment was a bit out of hand so I apologise for it.

She held on to Bitcoin for more than five years. I imagine it’s a lot longer than your average Redditor and she has made a great ROI which she is reinvesting into real estate. 
Let’s not be jerks on the Internet giving financial advise to other strangers.

My income denomination is approximately split 50/50 between contract work and trading. For the former, it could be USD, EUR or HKD depending on client preferences. If it’s a different currency with low liquidity we just default to USD. I personally prefer HKD since it’s pegged to the greenback and liquidity is pretty low so my rates in HKD nets me an additional 1% - 2%. I’m pretty flexible on this matter as long I get paid in BTC. If a client prefers Ethereum, I’ll just point them to an exchange. 
When it’s time for living expenses, I’m fortunate to have a few OTC buyers ready to scoop up some BTC for market rates.
I have generally steered away from cards due to the fees and my skepticism towards banking overall. I’m pretty much 100% cash when I hold fiat. Anything that requires online payments can be bought in Bitcoin if you are determined! 
The rest is denominated in sats ;)

Bitcoin and crypto in general is still highly speculative. None of us knows if Bitcoin will outlive the currency you consider ‘valueless’ and stating otherwise is not very sensible to me. 
10K BTC used to buy you a pizza. Today 1 BTC buys you a $10,000 high end kitchen with marble counter tops. It’s absolutely mind boggling how far we have come so let’s appreciate the situation for what it is. After all this is what price discovery looks like.

Thank you for the wholesome response. In my situation, I can’t allow myself to be ignorant in any way towards Bitcoin. My income and expenses are 100% Bitcoin.

OpenDime is a good idea but $100 in a Trezor isn’t ideal

Long time hodler but I don’t mind spending my bitcoin since a large part of my income is in crypto. This and other forms of merchant adoption streamlines accessibility to the existing economy for us who are really into this.

OP how was the QR code presented to you? Might had been a slight chance that the vendor slipped in their own address on top of the legitimate one.

This looks exactly the same as Blocknet. They’ve just replaced the logo in the top left corner.

I’m not sure if I follow. Isn’t this @_date: 2018-10-25 02:40:47
Isn’t OP afraid of PayPal chargebacks?

Been using purse.io for about a year. Most recent order came in the mail today! Expecting another one on Monday. Everything’s from Amazon. Live in SEA and have not had any issues so far.

Ok. If you have any friends based in the US, they could always fill in for you. Gift cards online usually are at what 1 to 5% premium? Just give that to a friend instead. Alternatively accumulate items at a forwarding service (using a friend) and send in one massive batch a few months later if you are not in a hurry.
Or check paxful. Might be something of interest that could work on there.

I think people are suggesting that your intentions and the quote are not really intended for the same audience. Satoshi wasn’t directing it at the uninformed, just the informed and ignorant fools who doesn’t or refuses to ‘get it’ 
Art arguably should be about distributing knowledge and while this one does so... it’s not really exactly that yet
Either way it looks really good but try to find a revised composition if you are planning on using it as a display item but if it’s really for personal use who the hell cares.

Lydia is a keeper. A good balance of skepticism and open mindedness.

Wow how is 15,000% return in a few years ‘not that bad’ Literally anywhere else; 100% gain in a few years is drool worthy. We be crypto and so spoiled but then again this is crypto after all...

Bitcoin would have to rise 120x to match that. I guess the rest is up to our imaginations

You are speculating a bit too much on the potential costs to attack a POS system. The problem is that we don’t know how much (or little) it could cost to attack what is supposedly to be an immutable POS trillion dollar coin. 
Granted this uncertainty also extends a bit into POW but it is more manageable and predictable.
Edit: Think about this. POS would be secured by the same speculative asset that it is trying to protect.

2017 
“Let’s activate Segwit”
“Successfully activated Segwit, we did it bois”
2018 
“Lightning is coming!”
“We are actually getting there”
2019 
Zoom out enough, these are moments to be written down in history as major accomplishments.
