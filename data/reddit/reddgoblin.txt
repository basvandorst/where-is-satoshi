Bitcoin maintains value because it has limited supply and offers a standard unified protocol for P2P money transfers.
Having unlimited competing CCs in real-world use creates fragmentation in the protocol and hence reduces the overall benefit.  It also introduces unlimited supply to the ecosystem - hence no longer being a store of wealth.
Alternatives CCs are great for experimentation / testing new ideas, but any true advantages should be incorporated into bitcoin itself while maintaining the current blockchain.

Um, I'm not planning on manufacturing tshirts - you get to keep the design.  It's just a fun contest to encourage people to contribute to the bitcoin community.

Only invest what you can afford to lose.  Bitcoin is currently at over $200 - hopefully it goes up, but it might have another big crash.

I would recommend  to new users instead of coin base.  It seems to have fewer problems and lower fees.

Yep.  Someone trying with robots to cause boom and bust cycles = profit.
