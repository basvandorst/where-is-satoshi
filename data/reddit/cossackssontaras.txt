Technically, they could have done this transaction for free. When transacting large amounts (e.g. 1 BTC) you don't need to pay to get included in a block right away (as long as the coins haven't moved in a reasonable amount of time).
[This]( transaction didn't need a fee, for example. (Notice the confirmation time - less than 1 minute.)
The 200k BTC transaction's fee was either hardcoded by their software or included as a courtesy.

7 TPS is possible, but only if the block was filled entirely with one input and one output pay-to-script-hash transactions. 3 TPS is the observed average based on transaction sizes.
7 TPS could be theoretically exceeded if the transactions were just OP_TRUE scriptsigs. You could have thousands of transactions per second... but they wouldn't be the secure cryptographic ones we rely on. They'd be unusable for currency.

 This bitch bought his groceries with a series of large numbers referencing previous movements of value as seen by every computer in a gargantuan decentralized network and proceeded to use another big ass number to prove he knew this *other* big ass number without having to reveal it, and had the previous big ass number correspond with a fucking big ass number provided by the store so that funds witnessed by the first big ass number could be transferred to who ever owned the corresponding secret number involving the latest big ass numberand this is all donned without asking for permission, without paying any fees, and without a middle man. This all just happened in 0.4 seconds on a phone, and the freshly forged transaction propagates to every fucking computer on the network in five seconds so that now ten thousand nodes will remember it forever as soon as a fucking enormous application specific network of incomprehensible fuckwads of sha hashes can make one low enough to be considered impressive, in an endless race to do so before any other pool can. As the transaction propagated to the pool, and is considered priority, it is included in the next block to be remembered for millennia - as long as the network lasts - on every node that will ever fucking exist in the next 50,000 years.
And now someone can buy groceries with this method.

What we really need is some tools to help prevent it. If you keep your savings in a multisig or ss wallet, and give some of the keys to trusted friends, you'd be fine. The friends would not have enough keys to conspire with until you died, and you'd have enough keys to spend with at any moment.
It's not a limitation for bitcoin, but a problem with its users' methods of storing coins. Not everyone does it in a way that their loved ones could access it if the worst happened.

The genesis block has a surprising number of leading zeroes.
I don't know how much computing power satoshi had, but he may have been working on getting a hash that low for days. I don't know if he could have solved it between when the screenshot was taken and the timestamp on the block, with a few hours padding to account for timezones. It's still incredible for 213 blocks inbetween, though.
Then again he theoretically could have prepared the block in advance... But the NY Times headline limits that to when the article was posted.
This is very interesting! Are there any other screenshots left behind? (And does a dump of the old wiki still exist?)

I too regularly use my Chase Savings Account, and trust them to keep it working and private.
It is important to note, though, that anonymity is possible on the block chain. By never reusing addresses, occasionally or always using stealth addresses, and staying on the down-low about which addresses are yours will move you from pseudonymous to anonymous. Nobody knows where your coins go then, or which coins are even yours in the first place.
Currency aside, bitcoin makes a lot of things possible. The block chain was invented as a tool to create decentralized trust. Bitcoin is just one application of that tool. When bitcoin becomes valuable, mining becomes a major incentive. Competitive mining makes the block chain very widespread and trustworthy. Currently, 99% of what you see on that block chain is records of financial transactions. But what is really possible is much more than decentralized currency.
Because of the block chain, there are things that are now possible that were never doable before.
* I can prove that a document or file existed at a certain time without relying on an entity who is capable of lying to me.
* I can permanently propagate a file to every node that records the block chain, making censorship difficult and Streissand easy.
* I can prove that I own a specific amount of money (this involves bitcoins) without risk of forged documents or lying companies. I can also sign messages only visible to their intended recipient to prove that it corresponds to those funds and that I (the signatory) can spend them.
* I can commit a contract whose validity is publicly agreeable and known.
* I can issue my own form of digital commodity. This could be stock in a small business, redeemable tokens, worthless coins, or stakes in an asset. The possibilities are extremely broad.
* I can broadcast a message and choose when to decode it for public viewership. I can prove that this message was written at or before the time it was initially broadcast.
* I can create a fund (again using bitcoins) that can only be spent with a proper percentage of signatories. If I am in a group of 5 friends and 3 of 5 say we should spend the money on pizza, and 2 of 5 say we should spend the money on calzone, the money will be spent on pizza.
* I can lock funds or commodities so that they cannot be spent until a specific date.
* I can transfer any sum to any recipient with an internet connection for free.
* I can upload files to the block chain so that they will be remembered forever and never deleted. This can be images, documents, videos etc. This costs either hashing power or transaction fees.
* I can create trustless lotteries, drawings and bets. We no longer need to trust casinos or gambling sites to be random or have an edge.
I can keep going on and on with this list. I understand if you're skeptical about bitcoin, but don't confuse it with some virtual pump and dump. This is so new that there's nothing to compare it to, and saying it is just a currency is a massive understatement.

No, just fifty that we know of - and on day 1.


Satoshi said he left to "work on other things," but he did it for bitcoin, as one last contribution. His leave was proof that the system could work without him, that he didn't profit from it, and that nearly one *million* bitcoins in his posession could not be stolen by the revelation of his home/identity by a future fuckup.


Satoshi was very thorough. He openly scolded others for deleting used private keys. There's no doubt in my mind his keys still exist somewhere.
I like to think Satoshi will come back someday. Imagine, X decades from now, 1 bitcoin is $100,000. Imagine what $100 billion could do. All in one transaction, Satoshi could donate billions to whatever charities he deemed reasonable. This could be his next contribution; Bitcoin was only the beginning.

The source wasn't released until 10th January AFAIK (the genesis block was used twice - once in a week-long test, and then again in this six-year economy); although there were already 700 main net bitcoins in existence between blocks 1 and 14. (These fourteen blocks were the only ones solved on 9 January)
Block 12 has a strange extraNonce figure. It was mined by a different instance of Bitcoin than the rest of 0 to 14, so maybe I'm wrong and someone *else* solved a block there. Could just be satoshi making sure nodes work properly one last time before sharing their source. If this is the case, 700 bitcoins were technically premined! (Only 50 of those 700 ever moved, though)

The only difference between SHA-256d and Scrypt is that Scrypt is made to be very memory intensive, so that ASICs aren't manufactured. Now that there are Scrypt ASICs, Scrypt is pretty useless, and brings nothing to the table that SHA already does.
Not to mention that sidechains will allow Bitcoin mining to happen with Scrypt anyways. Meaning that eventually all Scrypt hardware could be used to collect sidechain transaction fees (in BTC), with the same block target as Litecoin.
What I'm saying is, when sidechains come out, Bitcoins will be able to act like Litecoins, or any other altcoin with a chain, without actually losing the value that a Bitcoin already has. They'd still be Bitcoins, but with 2.5 minute blocks, or 10 minute blocks, or 50 second blocks or whatever the chain you're on agrees to. So I don't really think a fundamental flaw would be much of a problem, as until it is fixed everyone could stay off the chain with the issue.

 Litecoin exists so that GPU mining remains profitable. Its sole purpose was to make a more Bitcoin-like version of fairbrix, which was a clone of tenebrix, which was the first scrypt coin (heavily premined). Scrypt was designed at about the same time asics were, and was intended to keep graphics cards providing income. Everybody mined with them, and didn't want those investments to go sour from rising difficulty.
Scrypt did its purpose. Now it has asics, though, so it no longer possesses any advantage.  All Litecoin has left are speculators and asic miners, and, judging from the price, they want out.

Fees are an arbitrary bribe decided by the buyer. The bribe is for miners to include their transaction quickly, before another miner gets the opportunity.
Large transactions do not "require" fees. Small ones don't need them either, but they may take a while before someone confirms it.

The E is 0x45 which serves to tell us how long the arbitrary message was. Convert 0x45 to decimal and you get 69; the length in bytes of the message! This way we know when to stop reading the message and when to start reading what follows it.

The block chain would survive, and a hard fork could be started to manually adjust the difficulty to a fraction of 1, and begin a physical network. Blocks would be printed on paper and human messengers would be made to transfer blocks to other nodes. Mining would be done on paper. A winning hash would probably have three or four leading zeroes, and a block would take significantly longer than ten minutes to find and propagate, but transactions could still work if you can send them to the paper network. Fees would be very high because it would take a lot of math to verify transactions.
Calculators and solar-powered miners (like on a TI-84 or something) would be developed eventually, and the difficulty would be allowed to rise again until electric networking and math becomes reliable again, when the chain would return to its digital state and hardfork again to allow the last few years of low difficulty "paper blocks" to remain valid (and subsequently all transactions that took place therein) on the client. Difficulty would rise slowly, and then quickly, as mining equipment is recovered. One party finding lots of ASICs puts us at risk of a 51% attack; so, a new (perhaps temporary) algorithm-change would be necessary, while keeping SHA mining on a sidechain in order to accumulate and count all available traditional mining power. Once it is clearly shared, the algo could switch back, and everything would be back to normal.

Nobody is assuming that. Satoshi continued mining. Current estimates are that he holds 985,000 BTC, 668 of which were "premined."

I'm certain Satoshi made his own little testing chains between 2007 and 2009. We actually do know that the genesis block you see today was used in two chains; a week-long final testing chain, and then again staring on 9 January, which is the chain you see today.
We know very little about the "proto-bitcoin" chain using our genesis block, but you can check web.archive.org to see bitcoin.org in 2009. There are screenshots of it. Those transactions with Alice and Bob do not exist on the real chain.

Hey, you're a different guy.


I can write a program and upload its SHA-2 hash to the block chain before releasing it. Then if anyone steals it, I can point to the hash and everyone will know that I had it first.


Okay, but now it's going to be on the block chain *forever*. Torrents don't last forever, Tor isn't really related, and Twitter/Pastebin could decide to shut down/censor information any time.


How do you know that?


The only problem here is that you trust them. We all know how honest they really are.


You give your virtual commodity value. This is what reddit is doing.


Except for the "prove that this message was written at or before the time it was initially broadcast" part.
(Not all of this is bitcoin specific as it is block chain specific)


You annotated my text to say "again using magic beans" here. I can also do this with other virtual commodities (stock, bonds, assets), and I can do this with smart contracts.


Okay, but I still have to be actively trusting them to hold my money. I don't like that very much.


Who said we're buying and selling bitcoin? That's a ridiculous waste of money. By the time this system propagates further, you won't have to.


Imagine cloud storage, or Streissand attacks.


There's too much lying going on out there. Too much fraud. This will help us find well-meaning systems and keep us there.

We don't send money to the "genesis block" per se, but rather to the address that received the unspendable 50 BTC genesis coinbase:
    1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa
Money sent to this address is "sent to Satoshi." The original 50 BTC are the only coins on it that are technically "lost." They were, by accident or by design (we don't know), made impossible to spend. The address works fine, like any other address, and if Satoshi (should he come back) were to empty it, he could only remove the 15 BTC on it not mined from block 0. (Those 15 coins were sent to the address by various people over the years. Donations to Satoshi!)

Perhaps, but not all days see 144 blocks solved, nor are all blocks found 10 minutes apart.
Blocks are kind of like points in time for transactions, for a transaction was not considered to have taken place until it was put in a block.
Transactions actually do not have timestamps. Only blocks do, so they're kind of the base unit of recorded occurrence on the block chain.
This system would be ideal for transaction records, or smart contract dates, but not much else.

They didn't have value at the time, and the bitcoins mined in the genesis block are unspendable. In terms of today's value, 50 BTC is $15,000 and you could solve a few blocks of 50 a day back in 2009 with just a laptop.

That's still risky. If the block they put the transaction in were orphaned or staled, the transaction to the empty string wallet would stay in the mempool and anyone on Earth could make a transaction sending the 50 BTC to themselves to be put into the next block.

1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa is not a proof-of-burn address. Satoshi almost certainly has the private key. The 50 BTC from block 0 are unspendable because the transaction is not included in the database, not because the private key to redeem the funds doesn't exist. Any additional funds it receives are spendable.

Money protocols should not be controlled by any entity.


Money should be a system and not a product.


Being "as cheap as possible" does not equate to being the product of a business. Bitcoin isn't a business, and it's undoubtedly cheaper than Western Union etc.

You shouldn't need a client; raw transactions will do.
It really shouldn't be anything to worry about. Again, once your payment gets 1 confirmation, it is irreversible by any means and time to send your product. :)

How about the genesis block :3
@_date: 2015-03-15 17:57:50
It's possible to mathematically prove ownership of a bitcoin address. I highly doubt the money will be returned without it, so you could lie and say you own the sending address, but you wouldn't be able to prove that without the private key.
FYI, you don't reveal the private key, either. Just a derivative of both the key and the address; that way we know you *have* it, but not what it *is*. This is also how the network verfies that transactions are sent from the rightful owner to the designated recipient.
@_date: 2015-03-21 23:03:35
What I'm implying is that there's nothing that really *can* be done. Our best bet is to stop trusting other people/services with our money (you'd think Gox would have taught us that much) but that's probably never going to happen. :/

This probably wouldn't last as an encyclopedia article; it'd be more productive to make a page on 
@_date: 2015-11-24 03:41:25
Well, it'd have to be something you'd see in a print encyclopedia. If it isn't an article, it's not allowed, and "how-to" guides don't meet that criteria.
Bitcoin.it is here to stay, though. It's not restricted access, you just have to prove you're not a bot. I agree that the content is outdated, but most people aren't interested in helping out. Mark Karpeles was actually in charge of the wiki's funds, and he's in jail now, so editors can't get paid anymore.
I really want it to be a viable resource, though. I made a new logo, and some sister projects, and I make as many contributions as I can. I can activate your account if you PM me your username. :)

im abot to bow your mind
bitcoins are round
take a ruler and bake a cake that looks like a ruler
now you have a bendy ruler
put the ruler around the bitcoin
its some inches
now take the real ruler and draw a line down the middle of your coin
now use that line as a diameter and measure it with the ruler
take the measurement from the cake ruler
double it
divide by two times the measurement from the real ruler
holy shit its pi
but you made a cake ruler not a pie ruler
draw a "pi" tick on the real ruler and eat cake
pi is bitcoin related **condirmed**

I like to think that someday, a bitcoin will buy a lot of change. Let's assume there's 20,000,000 BTC total and they're $1,000 each (several years from now).
If Satoshi were to return, he'd have enough money to make a lot of changes. The most circulated estimate is that he mined ~985,000 BTC. At $1K each, that's a billion dollars.
Imagine what a billion dollars could do; and now consider the somewhat crazy idea that a bitcoin could be worth $1M someday. Then there's a trillion dollars, waiting to be spent on the future Satoshi envisioned for us. NASA gets a trust fund, WikiLeaks gets a trust fund, everyone gets a trust fund! Satoshi could give fifty thousand organizations five trusts each in one transaction with OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY.
That may sound silly, but think about it. Satoshi's first contribution was Bitcoin; their second could be bitcoin*s*.

Coins propagate throughout the world pretty fast. You might have heard of Laszlo's 10,000 BTC pizza... Those coins are now *everywhere*. Every one of us with coins used alongside coins that can be traced back to 2010 (which is pretty much all of us) has a little bit of that 10,000.
So, if stolen coins are flagged as such, they're going to get melded with good coins. Then what do we get? Sort-of-good coins? If you use two bitcoins, one good and one stolen, in a transaction, the output will be two half-good half-bad bitcoins. If you were to split those two coins up again, into two different addresses, there'd be ~~know~~ no way of determining which one was good and which one was stolen.

1. It was 184 billion, approximately 2^64 BTC
2. There was no "hack" by the traditional definition (it's Bitcoin, there's nothing *to* hack)
3. The coins do not exist anymore and the block chain does not acknowledge that they ever did
4. This wasn't a very big moment... At the time only about twenty people knew that this happened until it made headlines years later

This means that you can make backups of your wallet. If you keep 10 BTC in your physical wallet and it gets stolen, you can still spend it from a copy at home.
