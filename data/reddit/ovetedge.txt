Not a surprise. I just try transfer all my Bitcoin out to buy suggested coins, an hour later still no full confirmation. 
Bad sign.
@_date: 2017-11-11 02:34:39
No, you check my Coinomi message. And my Bitcoin still with Shapeshift not being confirm yet.
I'm in desperation ATM.
@_date: 2017-11-11 02:40:09
Try send some Bitcoin out, especially through Shapeshift or Changly. See how's yours transaction speed. Then come back to tell me if I'm scam or you're as desperate as me. ( Hours later, still not confirmed )
By the time the transaction all confirmed, the coins I want to get in may be little too expensive or the Bitcoin sink even further. Bad for me. So, how's that I scam? Stupid

Finally. I was panic. 12 hrs later..finally... Bought ETH to wait until BTC price stable at 3000. Hope it will at least give me 50% gain for my pain.

Doesn't matter what you think, people will keep buying it until one day in the near future 1 BTC = 1mil, then buyers slowly fade away when everyone is a seller. Entire chain collapse to $2.50 / BTC. Die down for awhile, the cycle will slowly start again.

What crime he committed to make him a con-man? As teenager or young rebellion selling fire crackers? Or he denounce his US citizenship? Or he started earlier in BTC? If so, shouldn't Don Trump a Con-man of con-man? He launder money for Russian gulags by with those overpriced estates, accepted loans as investment without interest? Lie about many things, create lots of fake news try deceive public? Never release his tax return, something is definitely hiding...Gosh! Shouldn't him be in jail or charge with treason instead reward him a highest honor oval office President job?

Unlikely. He may become much poorer to feeding himself with instant noodle from vending machine for few months, eventually bcash will crawl back from few dollars to as high as couple thousand dollars within couple yr. Didn't BTC encounter such dramatic event before? Let's consider BTC only 21 mil supply is fully recognize by all banks world-wide. You may have a severe BTC shortage, BCH could come in as an alternative of BTC branch then ETH follow by IOTA.

Make sense. I'll be denial myself if I involve into BTC as founding member as well. Reason is so simple, if my goal was to create something hopeful change the world but I didn't profit from it. Why should I get myself famous in return possible harrassment by govt or even behind bars with phoney charges by law makers. Beside, IRS will be a nightmare and too much attention could ruin my health.  
I rather have the secret go to grave with me with satisfaction that I was one of the main player to change the world offer alternative may save many in future.

If Bitcoin split again, isn't it benefit us all like BCH? Extra profit into pocket?
@_date: 2017-10-13 02:10:34
Like many others, I don't care those mumbo jumbo tech savvy crypto things...All I care : will the transaction speed from one end to the other confirmation significantly improved? Will the fees reduce to be able compete with ETH or most of the altcoin?

If he is Satoshi, then I'll be his great grandfather who just travel through worm-hole leap forward into future.
@_date: 2017-10-13 02:13:01
Then still an absurd unrealistic basic day to day useable coin other than century old metals and gem stones we invest in hope it will appreciate over time. Glad that I dump all my BCH for BTC last week just for the sake hope it rise in value plus possibility split. Then will get out to BCH again if new BTC has no significant gain and real world coin other than simply a King of all coin.
Father of all coin = BTC
Mother of all coin = ETC
Children = altcoin
Break away family = BCH
Struck out offspring = IOTA. ( May create it new branch in future )

Is that possible to file a class action lawsuit against sagwit2 and company for any incurring capital lost?
@_date: 2017-10-08 16:51:16
Satoshi Nakamoto whoever he is, must be glad that he detached himself from Bitcoin world.

Ethereum Cash = NEO ?
@_date: 2017-10-26 03:14:23
Oop! Bitcoin crashes to $100 in 2 month...hold!
@_date: 2017-10-23 01:51:06
Seems pretty easy. Turn your Bitcoin into Ethereum.
Set a contract. Once the person got your locked ETH,  Money Gram or Western Union you the cash. Once cash out, send the unlock key to sender right away.
@_date: 2017-10-20 05:02:29
It could happen. If Trump couldn't control himself with his alt-right buddies and Kim JungUn work in sync, a push the nuke button, kaboom! Bitcoin vertice straight line up to 1 mil within hrs.
@_date: 2017-10-26 12:41:07
Sounds like people speculates on oil, when it gone beyond 100/ barrel, everybody, including experts, traders and journalists said the same thing: cruel oil will never see $50/barrel again.... Then not long after it crashed to below $50/brl.

Misunderstood on banking. Fees income for banks are not the prime income. Main revenue are from borrow depositors money to generate larger income through derivatives and lend it to businesses at higher interest. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 22:03:55
Is this mean there may be a Bitcoin civil war erupts lead by hardcore Bitcoiners? If so, will there be a new Bitcoin born as BCH mass migration 1 to 1 exchange at full BTC price with everything remain same except increase 50% blocksize? If so, will the Segwit2 took over Bitcoin plummet to below BCH within 48 hrs?
@_date: 2017-10-09 17:07:52
Another tax heaven for the rich?
@_date: 2017-10-09 00:47:49
Meaning? If I transferred all my BTC from exchanges and mobile wallet to paper wallet, I may be risk of losing the potential value if SexWit 2 take place?
@_date: 2017-10-11 21:11:35
Nah! Unlike China or Russia. America gov't most likely will not do those thing any more. However, will do something even worst, lock you up with creative criminal charge or having IRS to seize every penny never owe, then lock behind bars indefinitely. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 02:10:43
Not only that, even the Ethereum hardfork will be taking care of. Excellent wallet.
@_date: 2017-10-17 01:56:27
lol. Never knows WikiLeaks is fund by Russian gulags, Putin buddies, and alt-right conservative with Bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-10-23 14:36:41
It's not pump altcoin dude! Just a suggestion beside I didn't realize she's restricted only to BTC.
@_date: 2017-10-28 16:38:25
Actually, invest in Bitcoin riskier due to volatile price greater than stock is balcony. Stock price could do the same to investors. I remember Bre-X, Global Crossing, Morgan Stanley, Lehman Brothers, Yahoo, even Amazon, and Apple before Steve Jobs return. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 04:13:01
I've a new idea. Let's hardfork BTC again on Jan 2018 calls it BTA (Bitcoin America), then again in Mar 2017 calls BTE (Bitcoin EU), then again in Jun 2018 calls it BTA (Bitcoin Asia) then again in Sept 2018 BCA (Bitcoin Africa) final one in Dec 2018 BTP (Bitcoin Pacific)
Let's make 2018 a yr of Bitcoin hardfork yr.
Everybody wins.
