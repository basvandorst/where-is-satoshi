I don't care much for technical analysis, trend data or market speculation. I'd prefer raw experience. So what drove you to hold on through three years of growth and decline. Did you truly believe in Bitcoin or had you just put a small enough amount in that it didn't really matter which way it went? I'm really curious. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 19:53:01
So, again, like most things in life, Bitcoin will either suck or be great. Revelations.

@_date: 2018-01-25 19:54:55
If you can point me to one argument for or against Bitcoin based on anything other than speculation I'll be very impressed. The very nature of Bitcoin is such that no arguments can have any basis to begin with. It's purely a matter of opinion, self-study and speculation. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 19:52:12
Wow, that sounds like a great way to kill small business. Being able to accept online payments from day one is the only reason I have a business. I can't even imagine how many opportunities came and went because people didn't have the infrastructure to properly execute ideas.

You're making absolutely no sense, sorry. People will continue to trade Bitcoin irrespective of what the price is, they may just be more price sensitive and that may be an indicator for volume based measurements. But to be honest I'm note even sure what you're trying to ask. 
@_date: 2018-01-25 20:14:13
It just seems so backwards to do business that way. I've never understood why businesses push back against technology instead of trying to fight it. It reminds me of the whole Kodak dilemma. I must have learnt about that in every year of my commerce degree - don't fight what you can't control. Very seldom does it end well.
@_date: 2017-12-29 21:13:57
There's very little fundamental reason for _anything_ to happen with Bitcoin. At the end of the day the price is driven purely by the demand for and supply of the coin. Any price estimates are purely speculative, nothing more. The platform for 'take off' could be $5,000 or Bitcoin could go to $0 tomorrow. Nobody really has any answers, and they never will for as long as Bitcoin is what it is. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:11:13
I've never understood cryptocurrencies being compared to companies. I understand that companies retain a majority share to run companies, that's logical. Is that to say that a cryptocurrency is therefore a profit driven entity? Surely that conflicts directly with the very nature of what a currency is?
Edit: I need to do more research. I'm dumb. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:14:53
The fact that your mind jumped to defend the purchase of property when I hadn't even mentioned it indicates that most people associate property investments with the purchase of property. You're furthering my point. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:56:05
Wow holy fuck. You should really read back on your logic and find the flaws. What you're saying is that stocks have a determinable value and Bitcoin doesn't.

1. Slow transfers.

With respect, the Netherlands makes up less than [half a percent of the global population]( and isn't exactly a representative sample. In countries like [Zimbabwe]( where their own currency (Prior to switching to the Dollar) was for all intents and purposes worthless, Bitcoin is far, far more accessible than any investment offered by any institution. 
Bitcoin wasn't built for the first world economy. It was built for the global economy. The first world effect of Bitcoin will be less prevalent than the third world effect. Bitcoin is fundamentally changing people's lives in places like Zimbabwe, Venezuela and India.

Those are all good solutions but, comparably, Bitcoin is a far more accessible short term solution. Try and put $100 into property. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:32:40
Surely fucking not. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:45:00
Because Bitcoin and any other cryptocurrencies are not companies. 
The price is driven purely by demand and supply while in companies the price is driven by demand and supply in addition to thousands of other variable factors. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:04:45
There's no central body regulating the price of Bitcoin. For this reason the price on different exchanges is determined by the demand and supply on those exchanges. First world, third world, it doesn't matter. If GDAX takes off one day with demand it could be $2k higher than another exchange. Arbitrage will kill that disparity quickly but you get the point. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:21:54
Sigh. Bitcoin futures themselves do not involve a shift in volume, traders shorting Bitcoin by buying into it *based* on their futures shifts volume. 
The total volume of money going into Bitcoin futures is not going into Bitcoin. A percentage of it will based on the aforementioned practices but not all of it. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 07:06:57

The latter would probably be sufficient unless you were being audited. I could be wrong though. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:41:14
Confirmation bias. You're holding the coin, of course you subconsciously want it to perform well.

Ah, I stand corrected. That makes a lot more sense.
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:44:53
I think its important to note that it doesn't have to be one or the other. The two can coexist. I just feel that for the time being, for the most part, Bitcoin is a more accessible form. That's all. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:27:16
Fair enough point, my apologies. 
My point of view is not to have a utopian view of something that we all have very little control over. At the end of the day nobody knows what futures will do to the market. So as bad as FUD is, this 'Bitcoin will survive anything' mindset that a lot of people on the sub seem to have is just as damaging. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 21:16:18
I don't think many people are stepping forward to openly admit that they received $1.8mil worth of Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:46:12
You deposit $100 into your wallet and use an exchange to purchase 'pieces' of a Bitcoin. I can't really recommend much beyond that because my country has a very small scene with few players compared to the US, Canada, etc. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 22:03:27
It was more of a light-hearted joke, not intended to offend. I don't say college in Spanish because I haven't the first clue how to speak it. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:10:38
When you're looking at an exchange you need to look at their buy and sell orders (Usually but not always represented by green for buy and red for sell). The buy and sell orders will meet at a middle point (Which can be thought of as the current selling price). A wall is a lot of sell orders at a particular price. The wall will literally look like a big wall of red that the buy orders need to 'break through' in order for the price to continue going up. 
Also pls nobody roast me for this. I'm trying to explain it in as simple a term as possible and I'm not sure how it's coming off.

I understand that there's various ways to invest in property that don't involve purchasing physical property. But a lot of people don't know that. And that's why I think Bitcoin is more accessible than property investments. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:16:21
How did you manage to gain Bitcoin? The value of your holdings may have appreciated but that doesn't change them. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:41:20
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:52:15
With respect the level of some of these questions astounds me. 
Multiply your holdings times whatever the current price is, it's not difficult. 
0.0007 x 20 000 = £14
@_date: 2017-12-13 06:07:18
What I've noticed is that there's an equivalent practice to panic selling but in the form of buying. 
There's an indication of a price uptake and suddenly it flies. But then it has to taper off because the demand isn't sustainable. Once the demand wears off the price stabilises and we're back to, as you say, a stable point. 
When the above happens on a big scale (Think movements of $1/2k+) I believe that the regulative process could be regarded as a small correction or the price correcting itself. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:40:24
The only possible positive conclusion that I can draw from this is that the founders have a vested interest in (at the very least) the short term success of XRP.

@_date: 2017-12-03 18:18:32
That wasn't the point that I was making. My point was that it's *more* accessible (For now) to deal with Bitcoin. The same may not be true for you. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:15:28
It's very difficult to trade at all, let alone day trade, any currency/stock that doesn't have any fundamental indicators attached to it. 
With Bitcoin the only measure is demand and supply, so in a sense what you're daytrading is the volatility. And because there's no way to determine which way it will swing, you stand to lose and/or gain an unbelievable amount. It's looked down upon for how inherently risky it is. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 08:41:50
This is a great analogy and ties in well with the sentiment that Bitcoin is the new gold standard. I think a fundamental stepping stone in Bitcoin's development and projected success is acknowledgement that it doesn't have to be everything; it can be a store of value and stop there. There will be other players in the game and that isn't a negative thing. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:35:21
Slow down bud. 
1. You have less idea than anyone else who the volatility of Bitcoin will benefit. Probability is just a fancy way of saying I have no fucking idea but I'm hoping for the best. 
2. Bitcoin futures do not involve the purchase of any Bitcoin whatsoever. So no, volume does not necessarily increase as a result of futures launching. 
3. The history of Bitcoin has absolutely no movement relating to futures. Looking back in history will not provide us with any information on a best course of action. 
4. You don't even know what power the government took from you in the first place. What exactly do you intend to take bacK?
@_date: 2017-12-13 12:30:41
Yeah, this transaction sounds like it was going to be flagged one way or another. Wasn't very sharp to take $1.8mil out at once. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:57:57
Yes. As more money enters crypto in general, small movements will be less significant. $100 000 movements between banks don't really shift much but Bitcoin buy/sell orders for $100 000 can show, especially when there's disparities between exchanges. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:24:04
1. A good percentage of those holding Bitcoin are doing so for investment purposes despite what they might say. In order for Bitcoin to succeed it needs to be adopted. Investors are not adopting the technology, they're simply piggy-backing on those who are. This flaws any progress of Bitcoin, evident now in the price being driven by demand/supply investment and not by widespread adoption. 
2. Bitcoin is massively speculative. There is no intrinsic value other than it being a store of value and medium of exchange (Which, while *adding* value, doesn't give it any *underlying* value). 
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:33:56
They'd never lie about holding. Surely not.

A scenario in which the price doubles while the number of transactions remains the same is highly unlikely. But yes in that hypothetical scenario the fees wouldn't go up by much.

I mean he's not *wrong*. What he says makes sense because they are correlative in nature. But (imo) it has more to do with the demand for the coin than it does with the price of the coin. As demand for the coin increases so to do the transaction fees, logically.
