They are blatantly illegal under US law, which is what pisses me off. It's not like plenty of us didn't recognize the possibility a few years ago; knowing they are obvious securities and would require a lot of overhead beyond a white paper kept many legitimate entrepreneurs from proceeding. Most of the ICO offerings are from greedy scammers who don't care about the law, and when you get into to bed with those types, you will lose money. They care about making themselves rich, not the investors.

I see ICO ads plastered all over the internet, unsolicited, and I receive unsolicated SPAM for ICOs at any address I've ever publicly used in anything Bitcoin related.

This isn't a PSA, you dumb cunt, it's just your opinion and nothing more. Express your opinion all you want, buy don't misrepresent it as some sort of public service announcement. That you think your opinion is tantamount to a PSA is what is truly delusional.

Everybody doesn't know though. Most of the users here are grossly undereducated wannabe-libertarians, but there is a reason why the US has laws separating qualified investors from the average Joe. Josh Garza's Paycoin bullshit is proof of how many morons will fall for these ICO scams. I'm all for the potential of the blockchain, Bitcoin, and the evolution of how businesses are owned and financed, but the exchanges and sites trading these scam coins are guaranteeing that the SEC and other agencies are going to step in sooner rather than later. It is going to rock Ethereum hard.

Your logic is bullshit. All the people who knew how to exchange Bitcoin for Paycoin clearly didn't recognize it for the scam that it was.
