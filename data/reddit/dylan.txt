How’s that different from cash? A bill of sale signed by both parties.

To kick things off, use promo code redditBTC for 10% off within the Cryptocurrency collection. 
@_date: 2014-09-17 15:04:32
This would be a question for -- My intention is to keep the discount for your first campaign within our cryptocurrency collection live. BuySellAds may or may not choose to give a discount on funding your account with bitcoin / cryptocurrency at some point down the line. 
@_date: 2014-09-17 01:37:43
for reddit gold we use coinbase, for ads we're using autorize.net currently.

This would be a gift for a few of my friends who have discussed wanting to own bitcoin themselves but have been too afraid to get involved, would be a relatively low amount (I was thinking $10 USD), and would be a small portion of a larger gift.  
@_date: 2014-09-16 20:02:27
I hear you. We'd love there to be more bitcoin subreddits in the list, but most of them are entirely sold out. I can promise that if / when they are not sold out, they will be added to the collection. 
@_date: 2014-11-28 19:27:19
looks like you all figured it out, but feel free to PM Me if you need to talk further about this!
@_date: 2014-11-28 18:14:18
I believe it ends at midnight EST, actually. 
@_date: 2014-09-16 17:28:26
This would be a question for BuySellAds, since they are handling the bitcoin payments. I *believe* that they are converting, but I can't speak for them. We do convert BTC that comes in for reddit gold. 
@_date: 2014-09-17 15:00:32
Believe it or not, this wasn't my intention. 
@_date: 2014-11-29 16:13:15
yishan was always extremely pro Bitcoin, and that hasn't changed since he left. 
@_date: 2014-09-17 15:05:18
umm... not sure if... 
@_date: 2014-09-16 19:11:46
Currently that is the case. We are looking for ways to expand this, but it will be very dependent on demand. Currently we focus most of our time on improving our self-serve system, which impacts the sponsored headlines you see at the top. Those are our best performing and most engaging unit. If we saw a lot of success here, we would absolutely be open to expanding, so we really appreciate the feedback!
@_date: 2014-09-17 14:22:03
Thanks -- i get annoyed when writers don't understand this, but I try to  understand, it's a complex culture. 
@_date: 2014-09-16 19:45:00
The payment systems aren't the same and don't function the same. There is no advertising "account", or we could create a solution like BSA has. We would have to move away from our current payment processor and thats just not something we have the time to go through, lots of other priorities. If we found people were using this often, and bitcoin became a larger contributor to gold revenue it would be easier to devote the resources. 
Thanks for whitelisting reddit!
@_date: 2014-09-16 22:25:10
We are here more than you think! ;)
@_date: 2014-09-17 14:51:56
We are actually able to have expenses paid back to us via bitcoin, if we chose that. 
@_date: 2014-09-17 16:20:51
Cool. I'll keep this in mind moving forward. Feel free to utilize our sponsored headlines, which do allow this!
@_date: 2014-09-17 14:53:11
I'm sorry that you feel that way. This wasn't our intention. 
@_date: 2014-09-17 15:05:56
sorry to hear that -- Where would you like to advertise? 
@_date: 2014-09-17 15:33:19
@_date: 2014-09-17 01:43:09
We can definitely consider changing up the subreddits listed here. What we went after in this list is everything that is not currently sold out. The reason there are so many dogecoin subreddits is that the dogecoin community has subreddits for... lots of things. They're very passionate and create successful communities around all sorts of different topics. That said, through the rest of the week I'll be looking to expand the targeting into what is available. Which would you like to see us include? 
@_date: 2014-09-16 21:18:59
I think you are, too! Thanks for helping out and supporting reddit!
@_date: 2014-09-17 02:04:07
Feel free! There is a list here:  
My plan was to go through that to check all of them tomorrow. 
@_date: 2014-09-17 01:56:38
Thanks -- I just added: auroracoin, blackcoin, digibyte, mastercoin, myriadcoin, monero, tacocoin, vericoin to the list. 
@_date: 2014-09-17 01:45:55
We hear you. That may be an option down the line, but we think these collections are a good start. 
This is how larger campaigns work on reddit -- However we have a team of people that helps manage that, it's a much larger process so we are somewhat limited in what we can offer currently. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 20:56:54
Technically right now, it's not. But it will be again soon. stay tuned!
@_date: 2015-01-16 00:00:54
infamous!? 
@_date: 2015-01-15 20:41:00
This is a house ad that we run to promote the bitcoin subreddit. Nobody is paying us for running it. 
@_date: 2014-09-17 01:39:51
Currently this isn't an option. If you're looking to target alone you can use our sponsored headlines for the time being. If inventory in becomes available, we will absolutely add it to the collection, or spin it out on its own. Stay tuned. 
@_date: 2015-08-29 16:51:37
~~twitter doesn't let you target ads by search terms. It's certainly possible they are targeting people who tweet about bitcoin, but they're not targeting based on search.~~ 
@_date: 2015-08-29 17:01:50
interesting! thats new since i've used it. thanks for the heads up
@_date: 2015-09-24 20:54:06
if you read the article, the patent applications were filed 18 months ago... 
@_date: 2016-05-20 15:42:22
eh, yeah, i mean, tough to say because OP didn't put too many details. I was assuming it was some startup that was doing bitcoin stuff and probably raised a round or two. Certainly a could tank a small business though, yeah. 
@_date: 2016-05-20 15:30:03
Eh, $16,000 shouldn't really sink a business. It will hurt, but it shouldn't really sink them... 
@_date: 2015-02-22 05:02:32
but with this youre paying THEM on top of the service that you could just use yourself. IE --&gt; Postmates. This is really a shitty idea that just marks up other services. 
@_date: 2015-02-13 23:05:15
This is a free ad. Its not being funded by anyone.
