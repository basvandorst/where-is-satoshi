Um, isn't Bitcoin XT intended as a replacement for Bitcoin as a whole?
I suppose you could continue to use Bitcoin in addition to Bitcoin XT after XT activates, but it certainly seems like it's intended to be a replacement.

It would be an incompatible blockchain, not the same blockchain. They would share the same initial history, but at the point where XT becomes incompatible with Bitcoin, they would diverge. If I understand correctly, at the point of divergence, every bitcoin would effectively be split in two, so you could spend it separately on the XT network or the Bitcoin network. I'm not entirely clear on whether the Bitcoin network will continue to operate in spite of 75% of nodes trying to push an incompatible blockchain. Either way, it seems pretty clear that it's intended as a replacement since it won't even activate unless enough people switch to it.

Can you imagine holding up the express lane for 10 minutes for your "fast confirmation" to come through?


Really? How much are the spammers paying per transaction? I wouldn't have thought they'd be paying giant fees.

The library change was intended to be nothing more than an implementation detail. It still managed to produce a blockchain that was incompatible with older clients. The new, tiny change, is intended to produce an incompatible blockchain.
The scope of a change is not proportional to it's size.

Bitcoin never had fast confirmations...

How about if, instead of wanking about who deserves to use the name "Bitcoin", I just make my question more explicit: What will the old clients do if 75% of the network starts pushing larger blocks?
As I see it, there are 3 possibilities:
  1. They accept the large blocks into the blockchain but continue to produce small blocks themselves. (Seems very unlikely.)
  2. They are unable to function because of too much invalid data received from the XT nodes.
  3. They continue to form consensus and advance the blockchain separately from the XT clients. (Seems the most likely to me.)
Is there some other possibility I neglected?


Last time, the fork was accidental and some people went through some trouble to ensure there was a stronger proof of work for the chain that was compatible with all clients. With XT, the whole point is to create a blockchain which is not compatible with all clients, so I doubt anyone will make a sufficient effort to have it abandoned. Of course, if 75% of the userbase stops accepting the original bitcoins it may be enough for them to get slowly abandoned over time. It's unlikely everyone will instantly switch though.
