I could mention how you are not financially successful, how you are deeply lonely, or the psychological profile of the typical troll (underachiever, low income, few friends, often physical insecurities or perceived deficiencies, borderline sociopathic tendencies).
But I do wish you well. Maybe someone will offer you some wisdom, or you'll get a job, or meet a girl.

Bye! Don't let the door hit your ass on the way out, concern troll.
It's a tough world and I think laying into the company that will first be made obsolete by Bitcoin is one of the first truly smart things this community has done in a while.
Play offense, not defense. Western Union is a sleazy money moat that rips off immigrants and those who are "unbanked" - the very people who stand to benefit from cryptocurrency the most.

In what way is this wildly deceitful? 
You use a Western Union form to send money via Western Union. You use a web form or QR code to send money via bitcoin. Seems quite accurate.

It's Thanksgiving week. You aren't traveling or with family, you're just spreading negativity.
As I said in my post, either a) mental instability and envy b) lowly paid cubicle astroturfers. Plenty of dumb, unfriendly assholes on the Internet. You're just one in  million buddy.

Took a while, but I gotcha. :-)
@_date: 2014-11-25 23:09:57
You're a fucking idiot. :-)

Good, another lonely broke loser to play with. Or are you the same person? It doesn't matter. You don't matter. :-)
And the more negativity you spread, the harder the universe will fuck you. Although by making you an unhappy, lonely troll who spends all day railing against an experimental online technology, I think you might already be in your own personal hell. Either a lack of intelligence or a lack of money. Neither are fun places to be.
