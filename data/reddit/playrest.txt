all bitcoin addresses already exist, gazilioshmazilionbizilion of them, so u just need to know private key of particular one and u can access it, u can make up lil story in ur head "lil hood had a pig" and then encode it in sha256 and import in bitcoin wallet and u can access the contents ofc it probably gonna be empty :P

i never sleep in mosquito spots, point of sleeping in wild is to be invisible, never bothered by anyone, noone even thinks someone is sleeping in some random bushes. im disgusted by toilets, even when visiting my mom i would shit in the woods.

i never been in a shelter, i sleep wild in bushes, i love it! my gf tried to domesticate me but i find living in artificial cave rather fucked up, i love i can just wake up and go never to return also i can stand up and pee right there and trash around and not care if kitchen sink gets pluged and ofc no bills no taxes(even if rich just the fact u have to pay something gives me anxiety i have no time for dat shit), obviously warm climate helps!
