How high do you think bcash will go? I want to invest before it's too late. It's already ~$2800, and 2 days ago it was at $1700...
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:44:51
Ok, I said how high do you *think* it will go? Just asking for opinions but nevermind
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:44:18
Yeah nothing is happening

Why is it that when Bitcoin goes down in price, litecoin, ethereum, and other small coins go up? Bitcoin went from $19,750 to $19,000 and litecoin went up from $288 to $322 and Ethereum went from $689 to $710 and dash went from $899 to freaking $1230. I don't get it.

I haven't been verified by Kraken yet so I can't even do shit. And this is all while the prices for alt coins are skyrocketing.

I just ordered yesterday from their official website!

In order to get verified with Kraken do I have to provide my income? Or is that only with Tier 4? It said something about using fiat USD and proving what your income is...

They actually don't know shit about investing money because their last investment hardly gained any profit 
Edit: They also made this decision to buy rather quickly and it seemed kind of reckless to me so I need an outside perspective
@_date: 2017-12-26 04:49:17
You should email them that is kind of weird..
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:59:56
Like american USD
