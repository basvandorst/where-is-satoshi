Sorry, meant to reply to you directly.

How about a dynamic system which tracks the price of heroin on the darknet and adjusts the amounts accordingly?

Their GDP has recovered precisely to its smoothly growing long-term trendline. The 2004-2008 GDP bubble was a symptom of the crisis, not a real sustainable increase.

If they reversed all the trades, how can you possibly be in the negative?

No native support for the tonal system for starters.

Don't try to change the topic. You said that there's a strong body of evidence that there were other DPRs. Where is that evidence?
@_date: 2015-11-29 01:11:24
Yeah but people like you are idiots so it does not really matter.

That story sure explains all the current SR-related stuff found on Ross's personal laptop when he was caught red-handed.

21's real business plan isn't to produce anything useful, they'll just use that $100M VC to pay themselves handsome salaries until the jig is up. The potatoes are out so that they can say "well we tried".

If you had completed your assignments yourself you might have actually learned something.

Also redditard culture to post about even the most mundane occurrences.

With the level of legal understanding you've demonstrated I don't think you'll be keeping your position as an "institutional investor" for very long.

God creates dinosaurs. God destroys dinosaurs. God creates man. Man destroys God. Man creates dinosaurs. Dinosaurs eat man. Woman inherits the earth.

For you too.

No, it's not entrapment. See myths  and  in the comic. All Ross had to do was to say "No, I'm not going to hire a hitman to murder these people". Instead he said "Great idea, please also torture them until they return my bitcoins".

What is this bullshit, how come I'm not allowed to prey on other traders' trivial and obvious mistakes anymore? Fucking statists!

Balaji already knows their business plan is shit, it's just that his current livelihood depends on keeping up the charade.

Because he has no idea how Linux actually works.

Lol, that "strong body of evidence" evaporated real quick.

If an economical niche for serving the IT needs of 65 million wealthy people opens up, other companies will be literally queuing to fill it up.
@_date: 2015-11-21 21:29:05
Not true. The attempted hits were part of the evidence for the kingpin charge of which Ross was found guilty, and it was enough to convince the jury.

If the nazis had financed their rise to power with bitcoin, people like you would have literally cheered them on. You are a real shitbag, Bruce.
