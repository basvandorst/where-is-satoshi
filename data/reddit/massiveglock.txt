Then why discuss things then? If a man was telling people on reddit he wanted to put all his money into lottery tickets, should no one highlight the risks purely because he could win and become a millionaire?  That is some weird backwards logic you appear to be condoning there.

Hedges are investments made to offset potential losses from other investments. For example someone, a hedge fund or a bank etc may put money in renewables before the decision on legislation which could have a negative impact on petroleum. If the decision impacted petroleum companies,  renewables companies might go up in value offsetting losses; if the decision didn't impact petroleum companies , then youre pretty much where you were minus the cost of investment and any losses you made which, if you had performed your due diligence, shouold be bearable. The point is that process of hedging is a calculated risk taken to mitigate losses. The world of finance and trading is brutal and there are vultures out there with information and market leverage others do not have who will use it to make profit.
Inflation reduces the purchasing power of money and in the uk for example where interest rates are low, money in the bank does lose value. I understand why someone might want to invest in other things which may increase in value. 
Your reason for buying bitcoin is based on the assumption that the traditional money system will collapse. Where is the evidence for this? 
1 bitcoin has lost 12000 dollars in the last year which equates to 80% of its worth. How have you factored in this massive lost into your reason for buying?
Surely if the financial system collapses, the infrastructure required for bitcoin, I. E. Internet, computing , electricity etc will be impacted.  Bitcoin requires high technology, how could it be used as currency in a mad max type scenario when for example things like petrol, bottle caps etc etc  old be used instead?

I'm not denying bitcoin and crypto have their place in the world or can be utilised as a currency in the future.  I am denying that bitcoin is worth investing in because it is 'deflationary' like gold is. It seems in these forums that people who lost out on bitcoin go through some weird self preservation routine where they justify to themselves how actually they're not idiots who lost out on a gamble, and its only going to take patience to get back on top. Bitcoin is not like gold at all. 
I wasnt inferring traditional currency and coinage etc cannot be replaced with crypto. My point was that people are investing in bitcoin and lite coin etc hodling  believing it will go up in value, which in itself invalidates it as a currency. If currency ceases to be utilised to transfer worth,  it will be replaced by something that can be used. If another crypto currency comes along which doesn't suffer from insane irrational speculation, it might replace the older crypto currencies hence the market will drop out the bottom of bitcoin.

You've lost all your money. Stop buying any more because it won't go up  cut your losses now.

Gold is used because it has intrinsic value as a rare and precious metal. People wear it, people use it to plate things, it is used in on circuit boards etc. That's why it is used as a store of wealth. Assigning value to something abstract like a digital currency is risky because market sentiment could change very easily against bitcoin for example. Why is bitcoin special, why can it not be superseded by another cryptocurrency?  Why do people want it?
@_date: 2018-12-13 05:42:08
To directly answer your question, simply because bitcoin is not currently traded as a currency for commerce. Although it is a currency, it is currently traded purely for investment. Who for example is using the bitcoin they accumulated when it was increasing in value to actually buy things? People are still 'speculating' on its value hoping for it to climb like it did before. Such climbs are self defeating for bitcoins future viability because they make it volatile and so not suitable as a currency; volatile currencies are usually replaced. 
@_date: 2018-12-14 07:27:18
Who is using bitcoin to to actually buy things at the moment? No one. People are treating it purely as something to invest in. As such it is currently not viable as a currency. 
Because it is not being used as a a medium to exchange wealth, it will not be adopted by the masses. 
For mass adoption, stabilsation of the currency needs to happen and this will only occur when it loses its extreme volatility. Having dropped by about 12k in the last year no one sees bitcoin as safe.
Prospectors need to understand that the bubble was a blip caused by sudden adoption by many people thinking they could make a quick buck. Many people lost money and with bitcoin appearing so extremely volatile, no business in their right mind will accept it.

You're deluded. What makes you think it will go up? 
@_date: 2018-12-15 11:29:22
I agree entirely that the value of any object is dependent on its perceived worth and what people are willing to pay for it.  Gold has some unique properties and is rare,  hence it is obvious why people perceive it to have high worth. 
What is unique about bitcoin which cannot be replicated by other crypto currencies? 
@_date: 2018-12-14 08:11:51
Companies were initially looking to support bitcoin because they saw it as an exciting new technology, it seemed to be relatively stable with an upward trajectory and so risk was low, and it was good for pr showing how modern and forward thinking the company was.
If a company is accepting bitcoin now then they're idiots and shouldn't be in business. Bitcoin has reduced in value in the last year by approx 12000 dollars. That kind of instability is extremely unattractive for a company as in accepting bitcoin they would be taking on additional risk.
One guy one beer if it is true that any business is actually still accepting bitcoin still isn't mass uptake.

Advice is there to take or leave. Good, caring advice is always warranted. That advice could save someone from ruining his life on a gamble.

Gold is a precious metal which has physical use and intrinsic worth, just like bitcoin. Oh wait...
@_date: 2018-12-14 14:57:55
"The only reason businesses don't accept is because governments and banks are afraid of it". Pretty small reason I guess? Are you stupid?
@_date: 2018-12-13 10:49:35
My argument was for giving advice. You seem to be in agreement then.

Gold has special properties which make it intrinsicly valuable. What special properties does bitcoin have which can't be replicated by another crypto currency?
The masses have adopted gold. The bank of england and federal reserve for example have huge stockpiles to underwrite bank notes. 
@_date: 2018-12-15 09:36:11
Other metals HAVE been used. Gold doesn't rust as well so doesn't degrade which is why it's used as reserves, but there could be replacements in the future. 
Elaborate on network effects?

Currently, investing in bitcoin is gambling. Don't confuse it with investing in stocks, currency, futures etc where you can carry out research and due diligence; while bitcoin is seen as a potential get rich scheme it loses any value as a currency and so becomes entirely unpredictable. 
 A friend has lost a lot of money in bitcoin and you will continue to do so if you put all your money in it. Why I hear you ask? Because you don't know anything about its worth now or its future worth and you are investing what appears like a large proportion of your income into something you hope will increase in value; this is pure gambling mentality and gamblers always lose.

Bitcoin is a gamble. The trading and investment strategies people present are based on pseudo economics cooked up at best naive students and kids who think they're more intelligent than they are, and at worst, by larger players in the bitcoin market who have enough market leverage to influence bitcoin price, artificially inflate it, and then cash out with aforementioned naive people losing all their money. This is precisely what happened when the bitcoin price peaked/dropped. 
Shrewd investors carry out due diligence. Long term and short term traders for example follow financial, political, environmental, sociological and economic developments across the world for most of their working day before making investments. Crypto morons simply 'invest' a lot of money in crypto based on information from the crypto rumour mill, spend their time circle jerking each other off in reddit forums about hodling, despair when they lose all their money, then go into self preservation mode thinking this is all part of the crypto journey and that with patience and 'strategies' they will make their money back. 
Crypto definitely has its place in the world. Just don't think that it is exempt from the requirement of due diligence before investing. You. Will. Get. Fucked.  Due diligence on something so insanely volatile is nigh on impossible and so I'm not going to invest or go short on it because it is fundamentally a gamble.
I put 5% of my salary into my pension.  In the uk the company I work for matches my 5% so my investment basically doubles instantly.  My pension is invested over the course of my working life and should increase in value. Seems like a sound investment,  with minimal risk, and good security. Definitely definitely definitely more attractive than speculating on something where the unit price has gone down by 12000 dollars in the last year..... it's fucking insane and it's ruining lives.
