It's like a confessional in the comments section. I too have sinned.

The Dot.com bubble was really a stock market IPO scam. Wall street traders were packaging up any 'Dot.com' they could get their hands on to issue stock as IPO's. Which is why the ICO's do have something in common with it, but not Bitcoin.

I come here for the memes, most of the advice is worthless.

Everything is impossible until someone proves it isn't. The theoretical work for quantum computers suggest that today's best encryption will be worthless in the future.

Oh and buy a hardware wallet with Trust funds, keep it in a safe deposit box under the trust account.

It took a couple tries to find the right banker. Once I got the right guy, it was very simple. He had me fill out one of their forms called a "Certification of Trustee" and that was basically it. They didn't need copies of my Trust documents. The hardest part was getting the institution trading account. I got ItBit and GDAX. ItBit was faster, but they had many questions (remember your 'business' is the retirement trust, not what you actually do, your source of funds are the rollovers). GDAX took longer but was painless.

This is the kind of article that really offers me reassurance when I start to listen to the critics. The author fundamentally misunderstands what he is writing about, so his opinion is worthless.

The price will always increase. That's the beauty of an asset that holds value, when your currency (USD) is designed to steadily lose value through inflation.
Ask your Grand-dad how much a candy bar cost when he was a kid.  A candy bar isn't worth more now, it just costs more because the dollar is worth less.

I ran into the same issue. I used Wells Fargo. Are you using a Trust? You have your EIN?

I see it as investing in value. Imagine if TCP/IP was something you could have bought a share of in 1996. TCP/IP isn't the internet we know today, but it is what todays internet is built on.
Bitcoin is the foundation that the future of digital money is going to be built on. That is the intrinsic value.
Yes, most people only see it as a way to make money, but that doesn't mean they won't.

I didn't mention bitcoin to Wells Fargo, but I don't think it would matter. The wire isn't going to some shady foreign account. The exchanges you'll use are US based, licensed, etc. and using FDIC insured accounts to boot.

Can't you make a cash deposit into a bank account with a dealer on Localbitcoins? I imagine there's a bank or credit union near you.

I'd recommend leaving the Trezor at home. Theft or loss is too likely while deployed. You can set up Mycelium on a mobile device and connect it to the Trezor. Sending bitcoin from Mycellium requires the Trezor to be connected, receiving does not. This will allow you to verify the balance, and it will give you receiving addresses to transfer bitcoin off the exchange.

Not at all, but I can't withdraw cash to purchase bitcoins, and I would like to invest a considerable sum. I thought an exchange would be the place to go.

You can set up a self-directed 401k or IRA. You rollover funds into a 401k that you manage yourself, and invest it however you like. It took me a few weeks to set mine up. The most difficult part was establishing an institutional account with an exchange. That was required because the funds must always be in the name of the entity of the 401k/IRA and not your own name.
I used these guys. [

You sound incredibly self-righteous.
Bitcoin isn't a replacement for PayPal. It's an alternative to fiat currency. Personally, I'd be truly excited if PayPal accepted Bitcoin.

I had this same issue, it's frustrating to know some people are successfully getting refunds, but every time I called it was "too bad, so sad".
I did get a refund after I contacted the guy who opened this [thread](
He's not publicly posting how to do it, because it involves a direct email to someone at PayPal, but I sent an email yesterday to the address he gave me explaining things and I got a refund today.
Actually, here he's posted it to Reddit. [Here!](
