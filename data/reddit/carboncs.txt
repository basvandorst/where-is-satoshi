They're raised $120+ million USD, CEO is a Stanford veteran, board member at a16z, and is about to head the US FDA.
Oh, and did I mention that their investors include major influencers?

Exactly. What they've implemented so far is like 1% of their total capacity.
They've yet to open up about their plans regarding embedded mining.

Wish I could. Highly qualified(ex Citibank CEO, Dropbox CEO etc have invested in it) people have been investing into it.
I believe in their vision, yes. It's an amazing concept.

Horrible way to project bitcoin to the wider audience
@_date: 2016-10-07 14:45:06
If you don't want to spend much, ledger nano S or the ledger nano  are pretty good along with.
@_date: 2016-10-05 14:55:28
That's just a coincidence(and in my views, quite intriguing)
@_date: 2016-10-05 14:53:23
Once upon a time, there were 2 things a man possessed:
1. A cryptographically fluent brain.
2. Goldmine of knowledge pertaining to economics
Also, he experienced the broken system of value exchange called "money". He also valued privacy.
This man, probably went on to create bitcoin under the pseudonym "Satoshi Nakamoto"

+1, make yourself resourceful.
