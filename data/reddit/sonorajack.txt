It gets less and less "retarded" as the price of bitcoin rises. I prefer millibits (mBTC) currently, since 1 mBTC = about  $1. 
I can quote a price as 157 mBTC, instead of "One point five seven bitcoin cents". 
But yeah, the wallet should give you the choice.

Oh, sorry! You're too old to use bitcoin. :-(

MilliBits are where it's at!

I tell / ask people about Bitcoin all the time. Work it in to almost all conversations with all people every day.
I've noticed that people over 40 are much more responsive that people between their teens and 40ish.  I often say, "If you install the app on your phone right now, I'll give you some free BTC."
The older people take me up on it much more often.
Teens &amp; 20's seem very apathetic to it.

Bankers. Governments. Drug lords. Organized crime. Maybe a mega corporation.

As an "unbanked" agorist, I can't purchase things conveniently online because I have no debit/credit cards.  And as an organic dry goods provider,  I can't take credit card payments from remote customers without revealing "taxable income".
Bitcoin is my solution to both!  
I receive BTC from remote customers, and spend it on Amazon via purse.oi and buy hotel &amp; airfare and shop at almost any store, even big box stores, using sites like gyft.com and cheapair.com.
I gladly receive it as payment or exchange FRN's for it.

Who the frack is paying taxes on Bitcoin tranactions?

You'd better not speed or under-report cash on your taxes,  then.  And be sure to report all money you or your kids make at garage sales, lawn mowing &amp; baby sitting gigs, lemonade stands, etc. 
And be sure to get a biz licrnce for the child care, and a health department inspection for the lemonade.

Bitcoin is not for law abiding citizens (slaves). It's designed as a tool of subversion, to undermine the banking system and the State. That's not just one way of using it; that's is main purpose.

We go out and buy groceries with bitcoin because we know it increased 5 to 15% in value since we accepted it as payment or exchanged most of our paycheck for it a few weeks ago, and thereby increased our real income &amp; spending power. 
And because we understand that bitcoin isn't worth anything until we spend it.  So we treat bitcoin just like federal reserve notes - we spend some of it and save some of it.
