People will mine... transaction fees? I don't understand that part. Would you mind ELI5 how miners are still involved regarding transaction fees?

You can't transfer 5 figures into a foreign country without it getting flagged, investigated and ultimately taxed. I've tried between UK an US. Had to ratchet the amounts down. BTC would obviously help, but market fluctuations are very volatile so could still cost.
Still less paperwork.

Thanks for the clarification. My knowledge is all based on UK/US transactions, and boy do they get grouchy if you try that exact approach with anything 5 figures.
On the plus side, this whole post has raised some interesting topics - thanks OP.

That's remarkable - how many separate transactions do you make? I'd love to hear specifics.

Ah, I hadn't thought of the reversibility of CC transactions, hmm. So in general you'd say there's not good way to use a CC to buy Bitcoin? That's a bit of a shame, so convenient!

Would love to know of these plenty of services!

Yeah, just saw one for $102,655.24 - damn
EDIT: Another for $204,489.49 holy...

I wish I had any understanding of what all these details are... the more I try to get into BitCoin the more I feel completely ill-prepared. :/

Interesting idea! Sounds very useful, although has the craigslist issue of having to meet someone and trust them.
@_date: 2013-06-25 13:26:44
Haha, thanks!

Last year it could, but due to the influx of miners, the algorithmic complexity has increased to the point where your CPU is basically out-classed and has no perceivable ability to earn BTC.
This is where ASIC-based custom hardware miners come into play. Here's one, and it only costs ~$13,000  :|
As like most everyone else, really wish I had left my CPU running a year or more ago...

Bitinstant sounds interesting, thanks! I hadn't heard much about it, could be handy.
