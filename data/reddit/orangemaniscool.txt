Lighting network will make ETH irrelevant to most users. Neat in theory but couldn't secure a niche before lightning was invented.
Same thing applies to Monero (XRM). Neat in theory but it's utility can be cloned on top of the layer 2 protocol for bitcoin and this, cannot justify its risk for people to hold unless they are just fans and like the tech.

@_date: 2019-07-03 00:09:39
How so? There are transactions that can be settled on the lightning layer that breaks chain of custody on the base-layer (main blockchain). Privacy is retained even after going back out to the main blockchain.
Exiting to the base-layer could involve entirely different coins so how would you prove correlation?

Are you suggesting layer two mixing doesn't work? Why is it a 'bandaid' instead if a new improvement?  Your language suggests there is something bad about it. It seems like a pretty rock-solid way of guaranteed privacy provided no user error (which is present in all systems)
@_date: 2019-07-05 19:16:02
What I was referring to was that investors that demand financial vehicles with full transparency will choose financial players that provide that service.
It's not all or nothing for everyone.  Choice is a good thing and the tech allows for full transparency while also offering a way to use the tech to provide more privacy.
I don't see a problem here.
@_date: 2019-07-04 16:51:32
I think you are missing how the two fit together. Yes, lightning can make bitcoin anonymous and difficult to impossible to trace.
On the other side, banks would have to explain why they are onboarding the funds into the lightning network which removes the transparency.
The point is that banks can choose to display full transparency if their customers want it.  A public blockchain is a feature but doesn't hamstring performance if full transparency is not needed (Hedge funds, etc.)

If person A makes a transaction with person B but funds the channel and moves money to person B than its pretty simple. But what if person B settled transactions for persons C, D, and E using only person As bitcoin for funding all channel activities?  You cannot trace person C, D and E to B when B settles the channel.  
You can't see the private activity in the lightning network.  You just know that someone started with a coin and now a different wallet has that coin. You have no idea how many new owners it had before moving back to the base-layer.


It could. It also could not.


Lightning network allows for exiting out to an entirely different blockchain.  Exiting out to a different currency and then onboarding back onto lightning is pretty private if you use different settlement counterparties.
I call bullshit on 'cannot be added on after-the-fact' as hot-swaps totally make it possible.

Interesting bit of trivia: Roger Ver shamed Andreas Antonopoulos recently about "squandering" his massive bitcoin trove back when it was still valued in the hundreds by reinvesting it in various bitcoin projects to build infrastructure and raise awareness.
Those bitcoins, if held, would've made Antonopoulos a millionaire easily.  Ver shamed him publicly for not hording and devalued his opinion in the bitcoin community as a result.  Ver acted like a rich dick and made fun of Antonopoulos for "being poor".
Roger Ver is a selfish prick who could not see the enormous following Antonopoulos built up over the years.  How could he? He is only focused on himself and whoever he wants to bully that day.
Well, practically overnight, [there was a large bitcoin community backlash]( to shaming a man who has contributed so much over the years.  This backlash manifested in direct donations to Andreas' wallet, making him a millionaire in the process!
Andreas Antonopoulos went on to tearfully thanked all his fans for giving him their support.

Something that never happened before is happening.  Traditional bonds and stocks are going through a time where it won't make sense to buy them.
Major investors (pension funds representing lot's of people's retirements) that are forced to buy traditional investments will be royally fucked chasing the decreasing value of those investments.

It's a good bet that anything the shitcoins can do BTC will be able to do better.  Lightning network is a great example of a protocol being developed on top of the BTC protocol.

Consensus of full nodes accepting updates. This has happened many times over the years as new updates to the blockchain are discussed and tested on the test net for months in advance. 
When something big and necessary passes the testing and public debate phase, an announced date is set where the nodes who want to participate will switch over to the new protocol.

nope.  It just won't be able to tell you if its confirmed until you have the whole blockchain.

Time to upgrade the protocol.  Being too early is better than being too late.

Apple was a trillion-dollar company for a short while.  An immutable ledger that anyone can use as a timestamp or a system of trading value securely should be of similar value or higher.

[Here's a basic primer]( on the difference between the Treasury and the FED.  Printing physical dollars shouldn't be confused with controlling monetary policy.  It seems like you are purposefully playing ignorant to avoid the fact that the FED is quasi-government.
Creating credit is better than actually 'printing money' and the FED controls that power.  They can 'print money' by creating it out of thin air in the form of credit/future liabilities.

Keeping it open source is imperative for security.  If you have to trust a third-party you weaken your overall security for convenience.

Sure, bro. Keep telling yourself that a 'private bank' that prints money for the country is not connected to the government.

This is last week's news posted in a new article with dates left out of the story (Wednesday instead of Wednesday the 18th of September)
This looks like bot article writing or the author simply didn't care about the facts and posted it today thinking the sensationalism will drive more traffic.

Interest for loans will need to come from value somewhere else.  This finite supply means creating new money through interest cannot occur without that value coming from somewhere else.
In nature, all nutrients must come from finite sources which allow for things to grow.  Organisms die and their remains fuel the natural cycle.  Money is supposed to follow this cycle as well but we could never achieve it until bitcoin.

Still not the greatest sign when there are no private sources for this window.  The government now has to act as lender of last resort.

I feel the same way.  Some people are upset that some other people have made the switch and refuse to look backwards.  It's simply a personal decision and everyone is allowed to vote with their money.

No.  My knowledge is based on historical fact.  If everyone is equal than those that are built to work harder will be labeled as evil for acquiring more wealth.  An they will be targeted by the communist government workers for punishment and wealth confiscation.
Communism has a flawed systemic problem.  You want the outcome to be equal but the work of individuals will always be unequal.  If you take from those that have acquired more they will resent you and abandon the system that punishes harder work.
This is why all communist countries ultimately have strong restrictions on people leaving the country.  They are forced to suspend liberal values and restrict their smartest people from fleeing the economic system that restricts their personal growth.
It's the logical consequence to the idea of treating everyone equally based not on their personal freedoms but on their material wealth/station in life.
This explains why communist governments always take the form of dictatorships.  There can be no freedom if you want to keep everyone equal.  People are not equal.  There are people driven to work hard and there are people too lazy to get off the couch.
**Equal** **rights** **not** **equal** **ability**
see [Harrison Bergeron](  Great short story by Kurt Vonnegut about a dystopian future attempting to deprive people of their natural talents in an effort to force equal ability onto the population.  Kurt Vonnegut didn't suffer communist fools.  His writing is as relevant today as it was decades ago.
