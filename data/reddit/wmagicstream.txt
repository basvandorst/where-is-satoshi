So if the Bitmain IPO fails BCASH = 0 ?

Bitcoin is the only digital scarce asset in the digital world. The only one that is not equivalent to a database owned by a central authority.
Bitcoin as a hard asset: you own it, or you don't. Like Gold.
Here is a real scam, now over: the OneCoin scam: [

If you look at Ethereum for what it is: A standard database ran and fully controlled by a Company. A standard database without any specific, or magical property, but with a JavaScript engine, that you can lend for some transactions.
Like an Oracle SQL database, with poor performances, hosted by an external and questionable company. If you think like this, you will be OK.
@_date: 2019-11-21 09:34:56
In speaking of databases, the OneCoin scam (wbd168) is enlightening.
Ripple and Ethereum are equivalent to our standard databases. As far as I remember, before Bitcoin happened, nobody was dumb enough to bet on a private money managed by a standard database. What next?

Same logic, transposed in the software world, that steel is more useful than gold, and so steel must have a higher valuation than gold.
Bitcoin is an interdisciplinary project: Engineering, Cryptography, Economic and Software. Ethereum is pure software project, and equivalent to a standard database owned by a few people.
@_date: 2019-11-27 00:18:43
This is not FUD. Ethereum is very centralized, and their communication is misleading.

Vitalik as the best Scammer? We have to look at OneCoin (wbd168). Ethereum is likely worst!

I agree with you; Bitcoin is not perfect, but Bitcoin is what it is. We must focus now on the layers side. Schnorr + Taproot are an improvement, and this is the only changes that make sense. On the other hand, Liquid is the proof that full privacy can still be implemented. Layers are the only way to go, but are still an unclear territory.
Bitmain is not the number one anymore; This is a good thing.
The Plan B stock-to-flow price model is a confirmation that only Bitcoin (like Gold) follows a scarcity metric. And a confirmation that Alts are only driven by marketing hype, and are fixing bugs that don't even exist, and are not even taken seriously by the people invested in them.
@_date: 2019-10-07 09:45:34
Segwit 2, with Schnorr and taproot will happen. We must be patient, and we can't put the cart before the horse.
@_date: 2019-10-29 00:45:17
Alts (everything but Bitcoin) are the ultimate proof, you can't replicate Bitcoin. This is the same with Art, owning 'Mona Lisa', or just a replica made by some crooks, is not the same thing. Bitcoin is 'unforgeable costliness'; Alts are not!
*A shitcoin is anything promoted as a form of money whose supply is easy to increase. In other words, anything other than gold or bitcoin.*

The easy money and war argument is also developed here:
@_date: 2019-10-07 09:34:58
PoS was studied before Bitcoin was ever released. PoS is fine when nothing is at stake. The 'nothing at stake' is an important condition, and is OK with all scamcoins.
Bitcoin is designed to resist state level attack. Bitcoin is the only modern sound money we have. If you think that any random snake oil technology adds any value, you are definitively missing something.
Nano is a wonderful scamcoin. Have you learned any lesson by now?
@_date: 2019-10-07 10:41:53
Bitcoin targets an unoccupied economic niche: Sound money. To be successful where Gold failed, you must be state resistant. Only Bitcoin achieves this goal, everything else are just companies.
Using the expression 'Bitcoin maximalism' after the 2017 hype, is a just a way to tell us that you have no clue about what is at stake; or you are just a scammer like Vitalik.
The Ethereum 2.0 concept is already obsolete. Bitcoin + Liquid + RSK + Lightning are already more powerful and are designed to be scalable and fully decentralized. We must forget the *premined* token: ETH.

* Bitcoin is an ultra hard monetary asset - A better Gold
* Sh\*tcoins  are marketing operations. They are printing free money for insiders and  friends. The price is pumped by marketing operations. When they are out  of money to pay marketing people, the game is over.

Bitcoin is successful because Bitcoin is sound money. Bitcoin covers the vacant niche left by the end of the Gold Standard. This is the main reason why no Alt can outcompete Bitcoin on the long run.  The software side must resist state level attacks and be sustainable for decades, But the monetary/economic side is what really matters. We can only process \~500000 tx by day at the base layer, this is fine as a final settlement layer (like a today central bank).  Layers are mandatory for scalability and to address the payment system requirements (BCASH rhetoric). Layers allow to implement full privacy too. This is the right way to go.
Ethereum is the definitive proof that *everything at the base* *layer* goes to unscalability, and full centralization.
Bitcoin is a hard monetary asset, operating as a genuinely decentralized protocol. Alts are not defined as a hard monetary asset, and are not protocols too, and none are decentralized.
@_date: 2019-10-24 10:28:48
The difference is simple:
* Bitcoin is an ultra hard monetary asset - A better Gold
* Sh\*tcoins are marketing operations. They are printing free money for insiders and friends. The price is pumped by marketing operations. When they are out of money to pay marketing people, the game is over.
*A shitcoin is anything promoted as a form of money whose supply is easy to increase. In other words, anything other than gold or bitcoin.*

'Code is law' was from Ethereum people marketing garbage. Code is law was their rhetoric.  And the DAO fiasco happened. They did a *rollback.* The code was not law anymore, and we have the smoking gun that Ethereum has no immutability property.
They are selling the decentralization concept on their fully centralized system too... Nonsense!
@_date: 2019-10-07 14:58:36
Privacy at the base level (monero) can't compete against Bitcoin. The transaction size is too huge, and very few people use it. Segwit 2, at the base layer, is the only technological option we have. It will be implemented. If Bitcoin is banned outside China. It will be for the sound money properties, not for privacy reasons. A new Executive Order 6102 will be ineffective against Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-12-11 15:30:32
I'm trying to explain that something like Ethereum is functionally equivalent to a privately-owned database. But Bitcoin is different. All the properties are real and genuine. Nobody is in charge, nobody can't undermine any property; like the censorship resistance, or the scarcity. Bitcoin can't be described at all, with the database metaphor.
@_date: 2019-12-02 15:02:39
If you can't understand money from the analog world; Why Gold succeeded, and iron, zinc, copper, glass bead, and etc... failed.
You can't understand what we are trying to achieve with Bitcoin. You will just think that Gold succeeded because of a random magical event. An event that can be done again, and again, and again... with anything else... If you are able to think rationally, and leave the magical world. You know that Gold was the best monetary good, because Gold is the **scarcest** one. If you grasp rationally what scarce means, you can grasp what Bitcoin is.

Jimmy Song articles are the right ones to explain what we are doing here.
You are in the **Bitcoin** forum. Not in a snake oil forum.
@_date: 2019-12-11 15:00:22
This is the reason why Bitcoin is a protocol. We all agree about what Bitcoin is as a protocol. When we are running a full Bitcoin node, we are enforcing the protocol rules. The idea of *emergence* is the right one. Bitcoin as the whole, with the network effect, and people following the *don't trust verify* rule are locking all the properties that make Bitcoin fascinating. And the properties of the whole Bitcoin system are more than the properties of a Bitcoin full node.
This is what Jimmy Song is trying to explain in the following article:

Decentralization, in this field, is a one-time event: Bitcoin
You should read the links below to understand:
@_date: 2019-12-11 14:38:12
A privately-owned database system like Ethereum is open to the public (1), and shows an artificial scarcity characteristic (2). Both properties are easily updated, without friction, by the people with full control:
Bitcoin belongs to a different category. The decentralization is the key.

[ *The Myth of Technical Innovation...*
@_date: 2019-12-13 09:57:18
Bitcoin is unique, and fundamentally different:
Ethereum is a classical database system ran, and fully owned, by a private company. Without the shiny marketing, and the hypes, this is just old database tech, and out-competed, with something like Oracle SQL. With its JavaScript engine, it allows to target people with web knowledge, and mislead them about what the enterprise is really about. There is nothing magical, nothing new from a technological standpoint. The only novelty, 10 years ago people were not dumb enough to play with database controlled, free market money.

Smart contracts are marketing hype: *The Myth of Technical Innovation.* This is covered by the Jimmy Song's article.
