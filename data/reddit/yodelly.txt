I feel ya .I went through similar situation invested good chunk of my money in to bitcoin and other cryptos starting from 2017  march i was obssessed over cryptos i intoduced my friends to cryptos most of my friends started investing but one of my close friend started investing through me like your boss he was just too lazy to do things on his on also he wasnt that tech savvy.i traded with my and my friend's money with his permission.Most of my trades were pretty good made profits for both of us .on the other hand my other friends started hodling they or own heap of profit now you can imagine they invested in around june.when i became too confident i started leveraging my trades  made ton of profit things went south when one of my trade went terrible because of my stupid decision rather than believing in myself and trading skill i was being emotional with my trades i took a big loss on that single trade, at this point my friend asked me not to trade his share.i kept his share safe in the wallet.i still had my capital and my profit i was desperate to getback  the money i lost in that trade. i was depressed  and  was not thinking straight.i wouldnt make the lost money  without leveraging. i'm lot less on capital since i cant touch my friends capital so i decided to take the risk used his share and mine to leverage again took loss again and my position got liquidated lost my capital and my profit and now whats left wont be enough to cover my friends share .Luckily i didnt take any loan or didnt invest too much that i cant afford but i lost considerable amount of my capital from my savings.But it taught me a lesson .

Yeah  after you sweep the coins will appear on your app.i think with copay there is small mining for sweeping not aure though.other wallets like mycelium, bitcoin qt,blockchain.info also provides sweeping feature.There is plenty of youtube tutorials.
Nano s.
Also keep this in mind if you want to do transaction more often i would recommend hardware wallet because they are portable and you can use them anytime anywhere.

Is it possible to see the network stat supporting segwit in real time?
@_date: 2017-07-23 13:01:15
You can use some wallet apps to sweep your coin from the paper wallet for example copay has an option to sweep coin from paper wallet .
If you are going hardware wallet i would recommend ledger as it has small form factor and the ui is very neat and uniform among all the coin.it also supports more coins than trezor as far as i know.

Restore your wallet using backup seed  to another wallet where you can use custom fee .

Yes you will have 10 btc in both the wallets as far as i know their official statement said if the split happens they will support both chains and the funds will be available in both the chains .i hope this clears out your doubt.Don't take my word for it .see the last sentence in the link i shared .so i wouldnt worry but in case you dont want to take chances ill suggest you convert 50% of your btc to usdt and hold 50% of your btc so you will have 50% of your btc in both the wallet atleast you wouldnt loose any chance of getting both coins.
