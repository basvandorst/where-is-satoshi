Why is it making me wait 4 business days..how did you get it in under 10 minutes
@_date: 2013-11-24 20:48:57
it's not like wallets are troublesome, most people need them with their license and other things they use everyday when going out.

you're the community that loves your bitcoin so much, convince someone interested like myself to buy in. what's so great about it. sell it to me.

I wasted over 5 weeks waiting for a US bank deposit for my sale of 8 bitcoins at 121$ per. I finally got fed up with their shit and asked for a refund and just bought bitcoins back with it. Waste of my fucking time, if I just kept the bitcoins I would have made alot more

same shit happened to me yesterday. after like 4 days of waiting to find out my order has been cancelled. granted the price has went down since i placed it , i'm still angry nevertheless because i'm not doing anything wrong and don't know what they base their fraud protection services on

you're also crazy if you think this is going to be something that's there as long as "buy gold" has been.

I was hoping I could get a more up to date sort of feel for why it's so advantageous to have BTC over FIAT right now , i'm sure the FAQ isnt updated daily with the news thats going on right now with it and was hoping for a summary of such

I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say you deserved it
who in the fuck invests their LIFE savings on something going so rapidly up and down like btc?
why not do something like stock trade, and OBVIVOUSLY not your entire life worth.
so stupid
