 *Weak hands will sell, long term investors will remain committed. Because they know that bull markets are born out of bear markets. Because valuation gets compelling after a 90% decline.* 
Apart from all this gibberish, how much do you actually have invested in Bitcoin? I feel like the average investor here has somewhere between a thousand bucks and twenty grand tied up in Bitcoin, with dreams of it expanding a thousand-fold. Most "investors" in the world are dealing with six, seven, and eight figure sums. The total investment of most of the BTC people here are barely even rounding errors.

Entire exchanges have been hacked or had their coins lost. A guy the other day said he'd lost 170K when his computer crashed. That sounds pretty insecure to me.

Ouch. I would stop doing that if I were you.

You also can't lose your house that easily. Someone claimed the other day to have lost 170K in BTC.

It's funny that you think that the version of the show you watch has anything to do with how things actually played out. They create a narrative, and selectively edit hundreds of hours of footage to show what they want to show.

That you own a house, a car, a 401K account, keep a few hundred around the house for emergencies. . .that's the stuff that makes you a dick? I guess we move in different circles. &lt;shrug&gt;

Try sending your Bitcoin to the guy selling you gas or pizza or to your landlord or the utility company.

And if it hits $50, what will your proportion be? How about if climbs to $3700. . .but it takes until 2032?
And do you only do cash/crypto? Don't you have any standard investments, like a 401K plan, etc.?

And yet people make mistakes all the time. The mistakes one makes with BTC are very unforgiving, as witnessed by the story the guy told the other day.

That's true religion right there. The sun is a burning ball of gas you say??? FAKE SCIENCE!

If you believe the bottom is 900-2100, why wouldn't you sell your BTC now and buy again when you hit those prices?

What is your net worth, 0.42 BTC or something? But hang on to it, I'm sure it will be worth billions some day. As for me, I'll take my financial advice from other sources than low-level crypto speculators.

Nah, it's a typical bear market, which is \~20-30%. Get back to me when it's down 85% like BTC.

How many Brazilian Cruceros do you have? Those are also worth zero. If there's no market, no way to buy or sell, no computers that maintain the evidence of your holdings. . .

Some day your .37 BTC investment will be worth millions. I just *know* it's true.
