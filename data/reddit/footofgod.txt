And at the same time we get to deal with the billion "my Bitcoins were stolen from [insert wallet where you own your private keys and it's supposed to be secure]! Don't use them!" Seriously, what do some of you want? Money that's SO secure that you can never use it? Okay, if that's your thing. But Bitcoin as a whole doesn't work if that's its only purpose, meaning you're not so safe afterall because the would-be Bitcoin economy collapses.   
What do you want? From an exchange, how is there not some level of trust? You just have to have it somewhere unless you're going to go mine it yourself and, again, Bitcoin doesn't work if literally everyone does that.

No, but as a poker player, I've bonus grinded before. It's really nice if you want to play. If you want to instantly double your money, it's not. It takes a while for it all to be withdrawable. Now, of course, if you deposit .05, withdraw your initial .05, and just try to double up the bonus, you can withdraw the doubled-up winnings, so its like freerolling .05 BTC.

I have considered the idea that this is the desired result of the US Gov't trying to drive Bitcoin back into the realms of obscurity. I haven't really worked out a conspiracy for it, because I don't really consider it a conspiracy: it's just business as usual. With their think tanks, somebody on the payroll obviously understands the gravity of Bitcoin, and understands that, while they'll tell the public it's incredibly vulnerable, it's really not. It has to be taken down by well-timed blows and propaganda to suggest what's going on and shape the public's reaction to those blows, throwing salt in the wound. You give them a gentle nudge that, in the long run, would be no big deal, and you convince the public that it's *obviously* a fatal blow. Once they believe it, it's too late.  
However, I think they've failed. Really, it'll just lead to another stabilization, then explosion. And they might have well predicted that, too, and are going to cash in on it. If they can't kill it, they might as well make bank trying.

No. But ever heard of chaos theory? The idea that small changes in initial conditions in systems (including the roulette wheel) result in vastly different and unpredictable outputs?   
However, in another breath, I'll say that if you could just cross off 3 numbers [on a 00 wheel] that the ball was not going to land on (or 4 numbers it was not going to land on with 75% confidence), you could gain an edge. I will admit that, with practice and patience, this is hypothetically possible. But I remain skeptical.

Never said it was impossible, though I am skeptical. Chaos theory is not irrelevant. It's extremely relevant. Wheels are built around it. That's what the little diamond-shaped extrusions are for. Once the ball hits that, or if the ball ever reaches airbound, the outcomes from the initial conditions spread so sporadically, you'd be lucky to cross off a meaningful sector. Because of chaos theory. Just like a coin can have a heavy bias if you catch it in your hand, but if you let it hit the ground and roll around as it will, even a 40-60 coin approaches a 50-50 again.

Trading is exactly like gambling and, specifically, exactly like poker. Some people have an edge and a bankroll to ride out variance. These people will make money almost always in the long run. Then there's people who maybe have and edge, but play so much of their roll at once that its just a matter of time before variance eats them alive. They could be longterm winners, but they'll never get there because they don't respect risk of ruin and the fact that, in large samples, extraordinarily unlikely things can happen. If you cant recover, youre busto. Then there's everyone else who thinks they have an edge, dont, and don't understand the differences that go into being stuck in this class. For these people, it is pure gambling.

With the exception of a few stories and occurrences in history (like Monte Carlo), there is no repeatable method that seems to actually be working. Variance could account for a couple unreproducable results, even after tens of thousands of spins.   
Again, NEVER SAID IT WAS IMPOSSIBLE. Just skeptical and even if it is possible, its obviously very, VERY difficult and precise.

But we have no nation, no gdp that needs to be sustained, in the example of Bitcoin. Is it even comparable, and how much so? Inflation exists to keep the economy going. Calling the uses for Bitcoin an economy is dubious at best. It certainly is ignoring the role a country's economy plays in its development, ability to defend itself, ability to form economic interdependence with others... see? It's just not really the same. I think trying to apply the theory of one to the other just doesn't work. It might be a bad thing for other reasons, but discouraging consumption and all the things that apply to a country's fiat currency are certainly not them.

You can't make things of this nature simple to the common person to understand. People don't even understand how the dollar works - they just see that it does, know that they'd accept a dollar and that others would accept a dollar, and maybe know some economics 101. I doubt they know about the fed, how they calculate how much money to create, buy and sell T-bonds to adjust inflation, and the endless things that actually go into the dollar being an effective (debatable, I suppose) means of transferring and storing value.
The most important things that are simple to explain are: no, bitcoin can't be "hacked" or created out of thin air because it's a big ledger, we all have the ledger, and the discrepency would stand out and look, more and more people accept it, so it's obviously legitimate even if it isn't fully mature. Nothing else can be made *that* simple. You can compare it pretty closely to gold mining, but then you'll have to explain gold mining to people, and again most people don't understand that in the first place. I don't think trying to explain these things to people is a waste of time or anything, but pretending it can be made easy and accessible to the point where people just "get it" with little effort on their own part seems silly. Bitcoin is at the cross-point of things most people understand the least: economics, math, and technology.

Their business model works by predatorily targeting people for the cause of addicting them from a young age. They want to (and do) make money on the intentional harm of other people. You do not have an informed choice when you are young. You can say "well, that's wrong, but..." but that's how the whole system operates and they get caught again and again and again. They don't make shit off casual smokers. They make bank off life-long addicts from a young age and masking the effects of their products with marketing, and their business model follows that to a T. I'm not sure what the right opinion or course of action should be, but complacence as though they have clean hands and it's mature people making bad decisions on a fair playing field is definitely not it. Ditto with alcohol.

Point taken, bit its still a system where you have to give your money to the Elite bankers to allow them to get an even bigger share of the wealth distribution just to have them give you back just enough to keep up... If they don't just take/lose it all at with little consequence.

I've found that people seem to believe this magical essence called "money" actually exists within the glittery confines of shiny things. It's troubling, really.  
I have another friend who thinks gold is only valuable now because it is useful as a conductor and that utility somehow = value as a currency. I pointed out "isn't it a problem if it's as useful as it is valuable, because then you'll take it out of circulation to use it? Like if your paper money was also the best wallpaper and you were torn between putting it up or spending it... isn't that a bad property of money, not a good one?" He still held hard on his point.

MLM is a weak workaround that perfectly mimics the setup of a pyramid scheme, but techincally skirts the heart of the law to be "legal" by having a worthless product that offers almost no opportunity for profit vs. signing up new people.
I don't think there's only scams in Bitcoin, I just think if you're going to pretend MLM isn't a scam, I don't want anything to do with anything you touch or support. Bitcoin isn't all scams, but it's undeniable that it attracts the worst of people because it is a great platform for it as it stands. It's the Wild West. And it's powerful, and that attracts scumbags at any rate.
@_date: 2017-01-18 15:24:54
You should run a pyramid scheme. Them mental gymnastics. If you honestly buy all the crap you just spewed, I feel very, very sorry for you. Never go into legitimate business. There is a difference between an MLM/pyramid scheme setup and normal, non-predatory business practices that still allow for heirarchy without being predatory by nature.

I bought my first two coins at $50. Had about 7. Sold them when I got married for a down payment on a house. Pretty bittersweet looking at it now. I was going to buy back in a couple months ago then had a boiler bust. Oh well, might miss out on the crazy, instant gratification, but Bitcoin still has paid huge dividends and I was always HODLER before life took precedent, so I'll get back in the soon.

This is an issue with the websites and centralization. A DDoS attack is completely different. Is it an issue? Of course. Is it what you're making it out to be? No way.
We have an option to use any trader. More traders will sprout up out of necessity, diversity happens, DDoS attacks do less and less, adjustments are made and only people who don't understand what they're doing with money they don't have lose a lot and view things like this as a catastrophic meltdown. Seems fine to me. Seems no different than the shit companies have pulled in the past to manipulate the market. Hmm, didn't Wall Street execs just make away with billions upon billions of dollars and get no jail time? I could have sworn I saw an article about that. No, you're right, this is *totally* different. Because computer h4x0rs.

It does put new businesses in a weird spot because every user pretty much knows they could be the first, and only, person being bitten by a scam. As a result of "first to act loses," nobody acts, the businesses (most of which WOULD BE reputable) sell almost nothing and fail, and the market doesn't expand at the speed of one where it's the merchants getting burned (i.e. how it currently is with chargebacks etc.).
Kind of an interesting dilemma. There's got to be a neat solution out there somewhere.

The level of misinformation being spread is unbelievable. We were talking about bitcoin poker at my local league. I had a few people interested in buying a couple coins off me directly so they could play poker. Long story short, someone eventually chimes in and insists "just see, in a year, bitcoin won't even be a thing!" How could you ever get that impression? I had to inform him "um, you know bitcoin's been around for like 4 years already, right?" I'm sure he had no clue. People seem to act like the first time they heard about it was the moment it became important/into existence. *shrugs*

Everything is only valuable because people say. That is not what makes something fiat or not by itself. Do you really think shiny rocks have some actual objective value? The reason it is valuable is because it is scarce and can only be gained at a certain rate, usually one that does not surpass the growth of a society/economy, so it's been a perfect non-fiat currency for a long time. Bitcoins cannot just be printed. They are mined in a much more similar manner to gold. They are finite and scarce. Anybody can potentially mine them both. Can you print a dollar? 
@_date: 2013-10-26 02:20:28
