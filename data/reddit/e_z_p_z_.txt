So glad to see this bitcore turd finally getting flushed. When this was sitting at 20k it was stinking up the whole sector and making other projects that have much better tech and actual practical uses look risky just by association.

Face it guys: 
 bitcoin has 0 utility. Between tx times, fees, and volatility, it must be without a doubt the single most useless currency ever circulated. "store of value" is a cope meme that popped up out of no where in the last couple months when it was clear that bitcoin had become antiquated and could never serve it's original purpose.  The ONLY purpose it has is to buy it and that a "greater fool" will come along who will buy it off of you for more. That works for long enough but eventually you run out of fools as the price gets so absurdly high and no one is THAT dumb. That is the point we are at. the party is over. They just flipped on the lights and you look around the bar and you see everyone still left hanging around at 3am for how they truly look. 'tis but a sober realization.
