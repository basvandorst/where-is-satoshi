There's not really any reliable sources.  Wikipedia has Saudi listed as legal.
But it's completely unregulated there
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:48:20
The source is an old news report without citations. It's the only news report that makes such a claim.
There's actually a Bitcoin ATM in Saudi..somewhere. too lazy too Google it.
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:41:42
No it's not.
Edit: Some banks might refuse to deal with Bitcoin exchanges. But there is no law banning it.

The system tricks you into freedom.
@_date: 2017-12-02 04:37:28
Yes. Because of the difficulty.   In 6 months I made back just over 1/3 of what I would have if I bought Bitcoin outright.
There's still a chance it could get profitable. But if difficulty keeps increasing I doubt it.
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:37:39
Has the transaction been confirmed?
@_date: 2017-12-01 10:37:46
Nicehash. Or mine altcoins. But don't expect to get much. A few cents a day maybe on a laptop. 
And if you're considering buying mining hardware, you're better off just buying Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-01 05:40:13
Leave a seed key.
Or a hardware wallet + pin.
Or both.

The noise will drive you crazy. Literally.
@_date: 2017-12-01 05:38:14
Yeah, best they can do is tax it and enforce KYC and AML. 
Maybe a few more rules and regs for exchanges (think fake sell walls and pumping/dumping), but there's not much anyone can do once you have crypto in your own wallet...besides keep track of the address activity (which is already being done in the US AFAIK)
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:35:16
Check the address in a blockchain explorer. The transaction should show up. It probably just doesn't have any confirmations yet

I have a Genesis mining contract. They pay. Seems legit. I made my money back.
But I would have made more if I just bought Bitcoin.  Unless the contract stays profitable for another year or so. Since profitability is down now

The problem with governments not being able to print their own money is there is more pressure to collect higher taxes and charge more for services .
This way the government operates more like a private corporation. Which might be worse than what we have now.
Neither situation is ideal IMO. 
I would say that there's so much more to dealing with this problem than removing the control over money.

Your keys, your Bitcoin.
Not your keys, not your Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:37:42
I dislike that term "the real Bitcoin."
But I agree with your point wholeheartedly.
Consensus is the most important feature.
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:42:59
I would argue that Bitcoin will need to scale faster to accommodate a large increase in users.
The fees and confirmation times aren't too horrendous right now but it could get much worse.
Segwit needs to have higher adoption. Lightning Network needs to be implemented. And dare I say bigger blocks? 
Actually bigger blocks wouldn't be such a bad idea right now. 2MB would probably be enough for the foreseeable future, especially as more and more wallets implement segwit addresses.
@_date: 2017-11-26 00:06:21
It's not difficult to write down a seed key on a peice of paper and put it in a safe.
It's not a perfect solution but it's what I would do if I had a large amount of cash sitting at home.
The bigger problem is stolen funds due to security exploits in hot wallets.
The solution might involve the use of multisig .

GPU mining altcoins doesn't really help Bitcoin any more than buying bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-11-26 08:31:43
Because its easier than saying one bitcoin is worth 2 camels and 3 bananas.
The value of bitcoin is changing and you need something to compare it to. Paper money is just a convenient comparison.

It won't ever reach 21m. Block rewards will keep halving every 210,000 blocks and the supply will get approach 21 million but not exceed it.

The block reward for mining Bitcoin will halve in June of 2020 from 12.5 Bitcoin per block to 6.25 Bitcoin per block. 
So the supply of new bitcoins will decrease.
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:09:03
Don't forget the next block halving in 2020.

You need to import your BTC keys into a BCH wallet. 
Don't forget to back everything up first.   
And move your BTC to a different address before recovering your BCH from your backup.
A quick search will get you the information you need.
Link below is a good place to start.
@_date: 2017-11-22 21:05:30
From a financial perspective, no.
Buying Bitcoin will be your best bet for maximizing profit.
Buying and running mining hardware helps the Bitcoin network. And you will most likely turn a profit eventually (probably in less than 12 months for the newer models).
If you are purely after profit then just buy Bitcoin. If you want to help the network become decentralized you can buy Bitcoin and buy mining hardware OR run a full node.
Don't get me wrong buying Bitcoin does help in that there's more people holding/spending/accepting Bitcoin on the planet.
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:21:54
double check the address, if its on the blockchain explorer the coins are with that address.
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:18:40
I'm pretty sure Genesis is legit. I have a small hashing contract with them and compared with what I mine at home with my hardware, it all checks out.
But everyday I wish I would've just bought Bitcoin with my money instead. Every single day.
Telling myself I'm helping decentralize the mining makes me feel a little better though. ��
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:14:41
I know exactly what you mean.
@_date: 2017-11-27 04:10:13
Yes segwit adoption would be ideal. And LN would really solve the fee problems. 
And I agree bigger blocks aren't ideal.
There's 2 reasons that I think a block size increase would do more good than harm (but only if there is overwhelming consensus).
1) segwit adoption is moving at a very slow pace, and though fees aren't a huge problem yet, if segwit adoption doesn't increase substantially soon, the fees could skyrocket.
2) bigger blocks would make full nodes more expensive to run. I don't see it being a problem for slightly bigger blocks, obviously 10mb blocks would be insane. But a 2mb block I think would be fine. 
I would prefer to see higher segwit adoption rather than bigger blocks, but if network congestion gets out of hand, somebody somewhere is going to have to do something sometime.
