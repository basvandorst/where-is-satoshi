He's trying to buy drugs on the dark web, that's why it's not practical for him.

How will roads be built if there are no  taxes?
@_date: 2019-03-20 14:35:54


Yes, 99% of people not wanting to give their personal info are doing illegal shit.
@_date: 2019-03-19 21:04:21
What kind of illegal shit are you up to?
@_date: 2019-03-31 09:18:45
What if it's 15$ in 2 years?
@_date: 2019-11-26 23:00:14
Yeah you're too optimistic.

His thief probably yelled jackpot as he opened his browser
@_date: 2019-11-26 22:01:32
Are you from the future?
@_date: 2019-11-27 09:41:37
yes he did
@_date: 2019-11-27 09:20:18
Wait what... your phone doesn't have a password? WHY?
@_date: 2019-03-26 07:37:49


Wow, you have $4000 and you need to be anonymous about that?
@_date: 2019-08-04 12:15:50
That's not how any of this works.
@_date: 2019-08-25 11:17:06
Well, it really depends what payment method you used on localbitcoins. If you're lucky, you might find someone willing to sell for below spot price :)
@_date: 2019-08-06 21:27:37
I can see how this touches a nerve in you, but the truth is  : credit cards work fine and they offer a really good level of security for both (host and guest). If I get a random request from some dude who wants to pay me with bitcoin and ON TOP OF THAT wants to remain anonymous I'm simply gonna suspect that something is off there, maybe they want to get drugs delivered to my house? Fuck that.
Bitcoin is a good way of transferring money internationally. Don't except Airbnb, Amazon, eBay to start accepting it though because they simply won't and I will guarantee you that ;)

My concern is that the withdrawal fee is very high. Suppose I buy 50 bucks on paxful, I want to send that 50 bucks to an external and for  that I'll need to pay 5 dollars to do it, that's 10% of what I bought. Does that sound fair?
@_date: 2019-08-25 07:53:50
Localbitcoins charges 0.00005 btc (50 cents) to withdraw. Paxful charges 10 times more than that.
@_date: 2019-08-06 07:25:30
Why would they accept bitcoin? My credit card works fine there.
@_date: 2019-08-25 08:03:26
We're only talking about sending out bought BTC from paxful to an external wallet here. You charge 0.0005 btc for it (5 dollars) which is too much.  When did you lower these fees? Are you saying it was MORE than 5 dollars at some point? Every user is paying 5 dollars and you're batching 35-40 transactions at a time (that's every 30 minutes) and sending them out at a low fee which makes takes more time to confirm. You're making around 180 dollars every 10-30 minutes (rough estimate) just because you're taking part of people's bitcoin.
Coinbase Pro doesn't have a withdrawal fee and I'm pretty sure they're more secure than you.
Localbitcoins has a fee of 0.00005 btc which is 10 times lower than you. That probably explains why they have more volume than you.
@_date: 2019-08-24 18:34:08
Localbitcoins doesn't do this. Their outgoing tx fee is 0.00005 btc (50 cents).
@_date: 2019-10-25 15:56:54
This is old.
@_date: 2019-10-04 18:55:45
you can buy them back? duh
@_date: 2019-08-24 18:36:26
The 12 sats/Byte was taken as an example as I was writing this post (and sent a tx a few minutes earlier), it took one hour to confirm. The cheapest and fastest fee that should be used right now is around 30 sats, so they definitely underpaid while \*getting\* overpaid..
@_date: 2019-08-24 15:32:58
Their business model is based on taking 1% of successful escrow trades, not charging more than is fair for outgoing transactions :)
@_date: 2019-08-25 07:57:50
Yes but at least they're being honest. Let's say person A signs up for the first time on localbitcoins, just wants to buy his first $50 of BTC and sends it to his external wallet, they will pay 0.00005 btc and that's it, they won't pay 0.00015 because they didn't deposit any bitcoin to localbitcoins.
Compare this to Paxful, they will lose 5 bucks to send to an external wallet, so your logic is that they're paying for deposit fees indirectly, something the average 50-buck-wanna-try-bitcoin-for-the-first-time will never do.
@_date: 2019-08-31 12:27:50
Yeaaah no.
@_date: 2019-06-02 09:12:50
Maybe he sold at 19k.
@_date: 2019-10-25 17:10:55
Sounds like you did something bad and you're mad they found out.
@_date: 2019-06-22 19:32:03
Just bought a hefty amount. See you in the moon guys!
@_date: 2019-06-01 16:42:53
He was probably banned for breaking their conditions and/or doing some shady things.
@_date: 2019-10-27 21:17:19
For me it sounds quite normal. They asked you  for proof of funds and you didn't deliver. Hence they closed your account.
@_date: 2019-06-01 19:13:22
No it's not, but getting banned on a platform is definitely shady? He probably used to send his bitcoin to the  dark web or scam traders there.
@_date: 2019-12-07 08:46:39
no it wouldn't
@_date: 2019-09-18 15:25:02
I think it's safe tosay that they saw you were depositing huge amounts of BTC to their wallet and started asking questions.. And if you HAD to come here to whine about it means you cannot give them the documents they ask for, which probably means you're doing some sort of illegal/scammy stuff.
@_date: 2019-09-02 21:46:13
I  know man, it's annoying and they have no volume.
@_date: 2019-09-18 15:43:54
I think anything above 10k is huge to them.
@_date: 2019-09-01 07:15:47
@_date: 2019-09-06 07:53:41
So that you could sell your bags at a higher price?
@_date: 2019-09-05 18:29:25
Why did you ask?
@_date: 2019-09-08 13:50:33
Why not 1.01?
@_date: 2019-05-31 15:55:57
It is a bit harsh. He could have forgotten to update his price as you don't necessarily need to use the automatic option.
@_date: 2019-05-30 09:08:15


Yeah because bitcoin was worth nothing, it didn't have anything to do with the banking crisis, bitcoin was an infant project, you would have needed an infinite number of bitcoins to buy a phone.
