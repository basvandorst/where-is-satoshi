.1388111 btc. Nothing compared to you guys but it still hurts as a college student with no income.

Did you get this resolved? I've been having the same issue for a while now and have not heard a word from them.

Why not just buy one of the chinese mice off amazon? You can get a good one for 8-15 bucks. I own multiple 50-80 dollar mice and a few chinese mice and you're losing very little when using a cheaper one.

People in other countries dont use beanie babies as a source of currency when their exchange rates or trust in government issued notes drop. Or to send money to support their family in another country. Or pay for goods and services without having to deal with big banks or paypal. 
Comparing the two is ridiculous.

Wtf is this? I'm a pretty novice web developer, but I can pull stuff out of my ass that looks better than this.

Haha, this reminds me of the MMG in Kingdom of Loathing. 
I had a 20 loss streak using this betting system and lost like a hundred million meat. 
I no longer use this system.

Everyone has this story. Had a chance at 1/5/10/20/100etc dollars but didn't buy in because too hard/didn't believe/too lazy and everyone regrets it. 
Buy now if you don't want to keep regretting not getting any bitcoin before it goes even higher.

Only 3 of us, but we have a lot of people interested buying some

you can buy bitcoins in fractions
the lowest denomination is 1/100,000,000 of a bitcoin (also called a satoshi)

You deposit money, use that money to buy Linden Dollars, and then exchange those for BTC, and then withdraw it to your wallet.
