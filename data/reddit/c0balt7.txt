What does this even mean LOL
@_date: 2018-01-25 16:11:05
Which bank did you withdraw to?
@_date: 2018-01-10 15:24:29
I’ve got a positive story about coinbase (for once), sent some euros via SEPA deposit, received within 6 hours!
@_date: 2017-12-04 15:11:24
Yeah their one GPU gaming pc will not make them any money at all, it’s silly
@_date: 2018-01-12 22:32:08
I am also out, just transferred to GDAX and then to my wallet so this shitty company can pay my transfer fees for me, cya 
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:04:10
I can imagine quite a few people, considering the events of the past 2 days
@_date: 2017-12-04 11:05:48
Go directly to GDAX instead of using coinbase, coin withdrawals from GDAX to a wallet are free one way
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:12:05
Exactly! People need to take a second to stop and think about the great team of devs behind the technology we invested in 
@_date: 2017-12-04 23:25:15
Should be a few hours, I believe &gt;72 hours and it will just bounce back but I’ve never experienced this, there’s about 50k tx backlog, so may be a few more hours than the original estimations!
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:25:49
How do you guys set it up? Automatic payments or a log in and manually purchase every X day?
@_date: 2017-12-25 09:09:20
“Go ahead give us a fine, we can afford it” like a throwback to the JP Morgan case!
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:36:20
Oh man we still doing the bitcoin name calling? Segwitcoin LOOOL
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:36:58
Yeah I’m hoping the transaction is stuck! I’ll pass over the info, thanks man
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:45:29
Someone posted that their friend works at coinbase, and it would be a good time to get some BCH as its coming sooner than you think
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:35:41
Yeah that is true, regulation would ruin the crypto market much more, I guess illegal isn’t the right word, it’s more of a moral issue at this point 
@_date: 2017-12-04 23:22:28
I purchase using GDAX, the exchange that coinbase uses. From GDAX I have been able to withdraw my coins to my wallet (Breadwallet iOS) for free! GDAX needs bank transfer tho
@_date: 2017-12-06 09:26:52
GDAX bro
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:32:00
 Think he was sending from exodus to coinbase, but due to the newly implemented BCH wallet, pressed the wrong address 
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:04:52
Ah nice I hadn’t thought of it from this angle, thanks! 
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:44:27
We’ll just agree to disagree! I think I’ll just stick to BCH and BTC because then there’s no problem
@_date: 2017-12-04 11:07:16
100% listen to this guy, GPU mining is definitely on its way out, and unless you’re willing to pay the mad electricity bills and put up with all the heat generated, then invest instead
@_date: 2017-12-06 00:29:23
Yeah same here. UK market for crypto is rather illiquid it’s an issue 
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:34:58
Yeah I thought that would be the case, I think it was around £500 or so, don’t know the exact details 
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:33:13
@_date: 2017-12-04 21:13:03
Thanks! Might look into the API, bun the coinbase fees 
@_date: 2017-12-21 09:59:34
Well it is illegal, and I think it’s illegal
@_date: 2017-12-21 09:46:43
I guess it’s one of the problems that comes with being decentralised and unregulated
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:41:02
What is the big deal about Bcash? It’s literally a shorter way of saying Bitcoin cash to me it doesn’t sound derogatory at all. 
And if grown people are getting that worked up over a name it really is a bit embarrassing 
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:29:07
Reminds me of the FIDLAR font 
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:46:44
Happy for you man! 
@_date: 2017-11-03 09:43:33
Yeah I’ve been doing some more reading, downloaded the blockchain app instead and it seems better to me?
@_date: 2017-11-17 10:59:38
Okay I’m from the UK and what i do:
1) download Revolut app for iOS/Android 
2) turn your £££ into €€€
3) transfer directly to GDAX (the exchange coinbase actually uses)
4) transfer to your wallet from GDAX
This way you cut out the nasty fees from coinbase! Just bare in mind card transfers to revolut max out at £250 per 24 hours, and can take 1-2 business days to reach GDAX!
HODL fast, my dude
@_date: 2017-11-09 15:20:44
Yeah man that’s been really helpful, thankyou
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:29:57
Even though GDAX is the exchange for coinbase transactions?
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:30:13
Thankyou I thought so, quite new to this so just making sure!
@_date: 2017-11-17 09:28:22
I assume GDAX will be temporarily suspended too then? 
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:49:42
Payments in euros from Revolut to GDAX, and then set limit orders meaning 0% fee!
@_date: 2017-11-17 11:18:23
Yeah dude, otherwise your bank will fuck you with SEPA transfer fees (up to £25 per transfer from high street banks) 
It seems to be the recommended way to do it from the UK, as the GBP market is probably the most illiquid right now. 
Coinbase is fine for storing BTC or EUR, as transfers between coinbase and GDAX are free, but like you’ve said, you have your wallet set up so you can avoid coinbase and it’s fees altogether. 
I can’t really help you with alt-coin knowledge, as I’m more of a core-coin person unfortunately! 
Tips I can give you, are learn to not become addicted to watching the price movements. 
Become detached from it as you will make losses at points, try not to panic sell!
Try to use limit orders on GDAX, as if a limit order fills you won’t have to pay any fees on the purchase itself (however the fees are extremely low I’ve found from using EUR)
Don’t take investment advice from anyone online, try and do your own research into what you think will happen - it’s your faith in the blockchain that helps after all!
@_date: 2017-11-06 18:25:39
Honestly I hold so little BTC I feel quite comfortable keeping them in blockchain.info, I feel the transfer fees will cut in too badly right now haha 
@_date: 2017-11-24 21:07:49
I don’t have that much disposable income rn, so I didn’t invest much in ETH, and bitched out of investing more at €280 rip 
@_date: 2017-11-17 14:32:28
So a limit order is basically ‘when BTC hits price X buy amount Y of it’ 
Means it can be done automatically and you don’t have to be there when it fills!
@_date: 2017-11-28 08:20:41
So revolut almost acts as a bank, so you just set up a SEPA payment from revolut to GDAX, using the details provided on GDAX
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:37:41
Always a big thanks to those people who buy near the highs, and allow us to break the sell walls!
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:17:52
Literally the same thing I was gonna do, hold through these times and keep faith, I pray it gets there before the next spike! 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:07:31
In the same boat as you my friend, just gotta wait it out! Think the 0 is a visual glitch, close and reopen the app and it should be still stuck at 40
@_date: 2017-11-05 22:22:36
Nice thankyou, I’ll check them out. Is there a monthly fee for the account?
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:45:25
Username checks out !
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:54:59
Because the uk market sucks for international payments, I use revolut to transfer my money into euros and then send that internationally to GDAX for free! It’s allowed me to get into BTC
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:16:50
100%, setting up a wallet for yourself is free, and then advertising that you accept BTC can be next to nothing! 
@_date: 2017-11-24 19:47:15
Holy shit if this goes through 
@_date: 2017-11-09 10:37:28
Would this be free with blockchain coins? If I sent them from blockchain to GDAX then to electrum?
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:21:49
Impressive dude, very jealous you had that set up!
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:39:26
Luckily the way I do it I’ve never had to pay fees, i crunched some numbers today and my outcome was hold through the dip and buy extra instead of selling and rebuying :/ 
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:39:33
Ah yeah interesting, it’s been a pretty hectic week hasn’t it!
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:00:14
Do you use regular or economy fees?
@_date: 2017-11-24 20:53:16
The technical capabilities of ethereum make me have faith in it, I bought in at €260 and it almost hit €400, and that’s over a period of ~3 weeks, I think it’s definitely smart to diversify coins 
@_date: 2018-02-22 10:57:09
Chances are, you make an impulsive trade out of FOMO and it won’t pay off in the long run! Day trade if you don’t mind never sleeping peacefully again lmao
@_date: 2018-02-18 11:08:03
How can anyone be 100% sure that there’s a prize at the end of this? Could easily be a moneygrab, with a faked winning story X months down the line 
@_date: 2018-02-18 12:49:19
I’d like to think so, but would they be able to see the answer?
@_date: 2018-02-21 23:01:40
If you’re in this for the long-term you should probably start trying to become desensitised to price movements and less addicted to checking
