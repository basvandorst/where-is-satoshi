This is nonsense.  Anyone selling now would most likely be paying short term capital gain taxes (assuming they got in when the madness started).  Also, most people will have a larger deductible in 2018, so it would make more sense to sell them.
Most likely scenario is that people who got in late are selling now at a loss to offset stockmarket gains.  Or, people are trying to avoid being the last ones out of a perceived bubble, which may or may not be popping.

It means investors in crypto don't want to pay the high fees of converting their money to fiat, so they are putting it in Bitcoin instead, hoping that it is more stable that the others.  Many are also putting it in tether, which is why that is the only 'crypto' with a larger market cap since Jan.

at $300,000 it will be worth more than all the gold in the world (above ground).

FYI, it has gone up about 200% against bitcoin since the start of the year.

Someone should make one with the Dollar talking down to BTC.  Or even - at this point - the Turkish Lira talking down to BTC.

Well the price is currently 57% lower than it should be.  If you want to say "the log of the price is only 10% lower", go ahead and say it, but the point is that McCafe bet on exponential growth starting July 17th, 2017 and we have not seen anything resembling exponential growth since then.   It only looks exponential if you go back to the beginning of bitcoin.  Even if you were to fit an exponential from the point of his original tweet, you get a fit that looks like it doubles in price every year, which would still put you way off the $1 million mark.  (by the way, you cannot fit an exponent if the number has changed less than two decades, which is the case here)
When comparing logs, you have to fit the base, not the value.  McCafee basically bet on base 10 growth, when in reality it looks like base 2 growth (80% off).  And everyday it passes it looks closer to base 1 growth.

Looks like it's off by about 100 - 200% or so.  Everything looks small on a log plot.  
@_date: 2018-08-31 18:06:44


Plot the bitcoin price from July 2017 to now.  It is not exponential.  In order to fit to an exponential, you need a least two decades of growth.  July 2017 was $2,700, one decade is $27,000, two decades is $270,000.  We are not even on a power 2 level of growth ($2,700 -&gt; $5,400 -&gt; $10,800).  If you want to claim a power of 10 every 15-16 months, we are also not on that current trend, (we should be at $18,800 at 13.5 months), but you could not even attempt a fit until 18 months  from now.   In the absence of fittable data, the best you can say is that we are below the necessary growth rate by about 80%, with nearly 70% error in the fitting.

Nothing dims the pain of losing half your money better than somebody else losing 60% of their money.
@_date: 2018-08-31 18:08:10
That is comparable to what you pay when you try to transfer fiat to btc or vice versa.
@_date: 2018-05-23 11:24:45
Just so people have some perspective, if Bitcoin were to hit $350,000 it would be worth more than all the gold in the world (above ground).
@_date: 2018-08-31 16:20:27
Well if you are going to run the number through functions to make then look better, why not just take the erf function of it?  That grows even faster than an exponential, and then we are not behind at all!

Still waiting for that 70% increase over 9000 that Tom Lee promised this week.  So far it's been a 6% decrease.

Someone will probably do another pump and dump.  They'll buy $1 mil worth of BTC for $10k to get the price up there, and then sell $100 mil worth that they bought at $7k.  Wallstreet is loving this right now - a bunch of young guys thinking they'll get rich is just too easy for them.
@_date: 2018-05-27 21:34:32
Anyone got a plot of lira vs. bitcoin since the start of the year?  My guess is the lira is up about 80% over btc.
@_date: 2018-05-14 17:51:52
Some whale made a big buy to try to manipulate the price.  It took a step up and now it is slowly falling.
@_date: 2018-05-28 19:06:40
I don't expect a really hard bounce.  Now that Wall Street is so invested in it, I think BTC will more or less follow valuation indicators that are similar to stocks.  Just like they value companies based on P/E, they will value BTC based on # of *real* transactions (i.e. not just buying one crypto w/ another crypto).  So once we hit bottom, the price will more or less follow adoption.  The problem is that most people are buying BTC as an investment.  There needs to be users for it to actually gain value.
@_date: 2018-05-28 14:57:31
It is doing something.  It is doing something pretty dramatic actually.  I'll probably buy back in once it's below $6k.
@_date: 2018-10-17 14:49:30
Is there anybody at this point that doesn't suspect Bitmain machines of being stuffed full of Chinese gov't hacking hardware?  They are currently at 38%, and I'm sure if you include all bitcoin mining hardware made in China, it would be above 51%.
If malicious hardware got into Apple and Amazon stuff, it is almost certainly in all mining rigs.  There is a reason Intel isn't allowed to make their chips overseas.

FYI, if Bitcoin hits $350,000, it will be worth more than all the (above ground) gold in the world.  That should give you a little perspective.

In principle you can evade taxes and buy drugs and stuff.  Otherwise there is no point (unless you live in venuzuela).  It's a bunch of made up money, and the $100b price is set by only $250k of transactions.
@_date: 2018-11-15 13:46:53
Plot twist, it's gonna take 50 years to get to 202 billion, and then the rest of the 'gain' is just dollar inflation.
@_date: 2018-11-14 19:15:06
I have my buy set at $4k.

that guy is gonna look smart in a month or two
@_date: 2018-11-14 19:12:10
Pretty darn likely.  Bitcoin use (actual transactions to purchase goods) hasn't gone up much since it was worth $10 a few years ago.  Only the price of a bitcoin has gone up.  We all know right now the price is being held in place by whales.

Does nobody remember when Buffett cornered the silver market?
@_date: 2018-02-09 05:01:50
Looks like its dropping again.....  
Real dip will probably be similar to a '14-'16  style drop.  Probably going to around $3k.  Possibly lower if another coin takes over.
You can move a dropping market with a really small amount of money.  Right now wall street is pumping and dumping just enough to get people to keep throwing money in.  HODL means decades, not months.
@_date: 2018-11-14 19:09:14
Can someone remind me again of "what cryptocurrencies are here for"?  Aren't they just to buy drugs and evade international money transfer fees?  Are there people here who still think inflation is the reason?  I hope not.

Here is the number of transactions per day over the past two years:
This plot signifies not how much people think bitcoin is worth, but how much it is actually being used.  I've had bitcoin for 7 years and have yet to use it for anything.  There has never been a scenario where is was better than cash or a credit card.
@_date: 2018-07-10 13:02:26
The number of transactions per day is [less than it was 2 years ago](    That is the main indicator that is keeping major institutions from buying in anymore.  How can you call something a currency if it isn't trading hands?
@_date: 2018-07-07 00:39:26
You can really tell from all the market movement ....
@_date: 2018-07-10 13:04:51
The trade volume includes people buying other cryptos with bitcoin.  We could just trade BTC and ETH back and forth for a day and make the BTC volume spike.
@_date: 2018-07-31 22:08:57
Aaaaand ...... we're below it.

Or just short it and watch the money poor in.  Shorters have doubled twice since january.

The price drops are usually gradual declines.  The increases are step functions.

One person buys at $7500.  Then everybody else starts buying at $7500 and the first guy unloads a bunch of shit he bought at $6500 to all the suckers.  I can't believe how gullible these cryptotraders are.
@_date: 2018-12-11 16:06:52
There has not been a scenario where using bitcoin would have been cheaper or faster than using cash.   Not when I've traveled, and not when I've purchased anything.  I could maybe imagine a few cases when I'm paying a friend for a split dinner bill in another country, but that hasn't come up yet.  What have you used it for?  
In 2009/2010 I tried selling my car on bitcointalk.org and nobody wanted to buy it, but since it was early I got sucked into libertarian communities who were excited somebody was willing to make such a big transaction w/ bitcoin.  I am not a computer guy or a libertarian, and I more or less just went with the flow for a year or two, looking for a chance to use it, which never happened.  
@_date: 2018-12-11 10:43:40
History doesn't really repeat itself, and technologies aren't always adopted.  (Concord, 40Ghz switches, Lyme vaccine).  I've messed around w/ bitcoin since 2009 and have never actually used it for anything.  The only people I know who do use it are drug dealers and people trying to get money out of China (not used for that anymore).

Sad part is that even when you pick cherries, the drop then was only half as bad as the drop this year.
