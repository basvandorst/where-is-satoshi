Any "big" dip like the 18k to under 10k one is the only shit I get scared about now

I was gonna yell at you for having your private key. Well played, well played..
@_date: 2017-11-23 01:08:05
I wish. It seems to just be another barter item in game. (albeit a crazy valuable one.)
@_date: 2018-03-14 23:29:35
Been in BTC since it was about $220...
This is still how I feel on the daily with all the fluctuations.

Kinda what I figured.
@_date: 2017-09-06 02:40:04
FUCKIN' HODL.

Trezor.io is the best wallet around, most secure because they need your Trezor or your private keys.
@_date: 2017-09-06 16:03:47
How is that important? The significance is probably going over my head right now.
@_date: 2017-09-06 02:34:01
What happened now?
@_date: 2017-09-06 02:33:36
What specifically should I be learning? I was taught how to mine cryptocurrency. Not how it can be used, apart from being like money. I have a generally understanding of how the blockchain works, and what mining actually does. But nothing about shit like ethereum, and how altcoins can run programs or whatever they do.
@_date: 2018-02-05 01:55:06
They could, but the backlash they would receive would be ridiculous. They can, but don't.
@_date: 2018-02-05 12:37:16
Commenting to helpfully get an answer as well
@_date: 2017-09-06 17:23:54
Is that a book, YouTube series?
@_date: 2017-07-01 16:07:50
And people don't realize that? I mean sure, your setup seems a bit expensive for the new or just gettting serious miner. Which isn't to say I'm not either. But in the long run, Solar Mining is the best option. Anyways, power cost was the first thing I was taught when I was learning about mining. And that the best case scenario is what you're talking about.
Two questions though, why do you keep reselling miners? Why not just use them continuously? And what do you grow in your greenhouse?
@_date: 2017-07-27 13:23:42
Why won't there be a split?
@_date: 2017-07-01 05:47:21
Well of course you'd be profitable when you don't pay for power. At least not directly.
@_date: 2017-07-01 19:33:31
So you keep reselling your S9s?
@_date: 2017-07-18 00:12:52
H O D L
@_date: 2017-07-01 22:45:27
And you buy more? Why not just hold onto them?
@_date: 2017-06-30 02:36:05


I'm not sure what that is. And couldn't someone take the drive? Even if they can't get anything off it. I'm in school right now, I don't want to have my coin on a drive someone could swipe. Even if they can't access it.
@_date: 2017-06-30 03:58:07
Okay, that's easily understandable.
Why doesn't CB give people their keys?
@_date: 2017-06-30 02:44:04
I was only taught how to mine, build rigs, etc. I wasn't made aware of any issues with CB until recently.
@_date: 2017-06-15 13:42:03
Okay, so WHY is bitcoin falling so hard? I'm not that nervous because it's happened before. But this is a sharp decline.

Holy hell the Hardware wallets are expensive.
Is the Blockchain.info wallet a good alternative to a desktop wallet? I'm sketched out by relying on physical hardware as I mainly use my PC for gaming and occasionally it likes to crash. Which I know if I store BTC on my PC I have the potential to lose it.
@_date: 2017-06-30 12:21:49
Thank you for the explanation
@_date: 2017-06-30 12:19:42
I was taught all about ASIC miners, hashrates, power consumption/efficiency, altcoins, Hashnest, difficulty, etc etc. Said teacher just told me to use CB for BTC, and Bittrex for altcoins. At the time BTC was super confusing, as I didn't know who/what to believe on the internet so I believed him.
@_date: 2017-06-30 03:59:09
The places I'm seeing they're around $299. Which I can cover, but I just bought another RX480 for mining eth for about the same price.
Sounds about right. The only way to be 100% secure is to have your own keys. Can you come up with your own 12 word phrase? or is it random?
@_date: 2017-06-30 04:45:27
You are very right about that.
@_date: 2017-06-30 12:26:24
Thaaaats super shady.. &gt;_&gt;
@_date: 2017-06-30 04:49:28
That's a very helpful read

That wall of links was all I needed.
Whats a good alternative to CB?
@_date: 2017-06-15 14:12:06
This is a bunch of bullshit. I can see why people would panic.
@_date: 2017-06-30 02:22:07
Can you explain what a Hardware wallet is?
