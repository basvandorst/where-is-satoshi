I normally do this but I got caught with my pants down I was on Bittrex stuck in a coin called Gambit trying to sell it back into BTC so I could then transfer back to gemini and if need be convert back into cash then buy on the dip. Luckily I have sold this coming at a loss and sold back into BTC and now have it in Gemini and will be ready to sell if BTC takes another big dive and will buy and hold  till I recover all profits and then some ��

Anyone else having issues with Bittrex? That site is a complete piece of shit! Any little dip in the market and you can't buy or sell, nothing! Total garbage! Goes to show you should we ever have a major correction like 50+% drop we are fucked all sites will shut down and your money will disappear!
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:06:37
Maybe I need to switch! Gemini is finally up now. I filled my order unfortunately I missed out on some good profits as it's creeping back up!
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:52:26
When will btc rise again? It seems like everyone is trying to get out of bch good thing I sold that last night lol. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:43:47
Which exchanges are actually up so I can buy???!! People are acting like the sky is falling just because Bitcoin is down 8% LMAO. This is nothing. I've been in this game long enough to see it crash 80% and come roaring back!! Now that's a crash so get off the damn exchanges so I can buy!!
