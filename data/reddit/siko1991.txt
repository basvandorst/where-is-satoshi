Why? Don't you want to earn from fees of payments routed through you?
@_date: 2018-09-09 09:10:24
Does that mean that you will open a 5k channel with me ?
@_date: 2018-09-09 10:21:32
I thought that on chain is only for settlement and normal payments should be done on 2nd layer solutions.
5k is not that big, not that rare. It is a normal payment.
5k can be a payment for a car, or a salary.
If not on LN, where will such payments be handled?
@_date: 2018-09-09 09:27:41
True. If I am the only person receiving a salary on-chain, then there's no problem. But what if other people want to use it too?
If LN is not for 2nd layer scaling, but for micropayments, then are there other 2nd layer solutions, that actually aim for scalability?
@_date: 2018-09-09 12:15:29
Thank you for the discussion.
@_date: 2018-09-09 11:56:28
Thanks. Good reply.
@_date: 2018-09-09 15:37:55
Ok. In that case... Tell me where the border between micro-payment and big payment is.
I will ask the same question with smaller numbers.
The salary of a Venezuelan is 30$. Is that small enough for LN?
Will you open a channel where you stake 30$ and the other stakes 0$
Most people in this post focus on the number and not on the question.
@_date: 2018-09-09 10:04:42
But will they open the channel if I don't stake money on my side? What is their incentive?
@_date: 2018-09-09 09:18:45
5k is a very "normal" payment. It is a salary.
So... How do people receive a salary in Bitcoin then?
On chain won't work (for everyone) cuz blocks are full.
LN won't work cuz you will need to have money in order to receive money.
@_date: 2018-09-09 08:46:50
So.... A bank?
@_date: 2018-09-09 10:03:23
So it's a honest bank.
@_date: 2018-09-09 10:42:31
Isn't that very risky for the buyer?
He'd want to move the money right away (because I know his PK) and it is no longer an off-chain sending.
@_date: 2018-09-09 09:53:03
Well... It makes sense for the payer to keep most of his money in channels - it gives him more liquidity and enables him to make more money by being used as a good routing node for payments.
It doesn't make sense for him to promise me 5k and not pay them, because that is a crime, and I can sue him.
@_date: 2018-09-09 09:23:58
You assume that the payer will have 5k just laying around, collecting dust.
What if the payer has put his money in other channels and tells the recipient "connect to LN somehow and I can send you funds"
@_date: 2018-09-09 16:20:14
Cool. Thanks for the good info.
@_date: 2018-09-09 10:28:19
So you don't need to have money *now* to receive money. You just need to have non-closed channels of money you had *before* to receive new money.
That works until someone closes a channel.
@_date: 2018-09-09 09:36:38
Ok... Imagine that I have 5$ in Bitcoin and I want a 5000$ channel.
Does that make it better?
Will you open a 5k channel with me?
@_date: 2018-09-09 10:01:24
Thanks. Very clean explanation.
Do you know of a way to receive 5k off chain, then?
@_date: 2018-09-09 15:04:18
In this situation I am the seller. Separate discussion.
@_date: 2018-09-09 10:25:43
I understand now that LN has a different purpose. I misunderstood.
But I expect new wave of Bitcoin adoption soon. How will bitcoin handle that new adoption?
I thought the answer was LN, but now I doubt that.
@_date: 2018-09-09 10:08:22
I can choose only from the ones willing to open a big channel with a poor person.
The choice on my side is not that big.
@_date: 2018-09-09 15:05:53
Because there are too many 5k payments in the world to happen on-chain.
@_date: 2018-09-09 11:34:37
Thanks. That makes sense.
@_date: 2018-09-09 10:33:28
Yes. Some other comments mentioned that as well. I see problems there too. Check out the other comments.
@_date: 2018-09-09 09:45:46
What will the exchange get out of that? Bigger fees?
@_date: 2018-09-09 08:41:47
I was left with the impression that LN tries to solve scalability for normal payments, not just micropayments.
Was I wrong?
@_date: 2018-09-09 09:43:15
I am talking about future usage - yes.
I want bitcoin as world money, so I talk about that.
On-chain for settlement and off-chain for actual value exchange, right?
So... How do I get my salary when Bitcoin becomes world money?
@_date: 2018-09-09 09:58:32
Thank you for the detailed answers.
It seems I did not explain myself well and some misunderstandings happened.
Opening a cheap channel with a poor person is fine.
It's opening a one-sided expensive channel with a poor person that is problematic.
If the poor person opens 50 channels of 0.5 $ each, he can get some traffic, true.
But he won't be able to receive a salary in LN.
On-chain transfer will be needed, no?
@_date: 2018-09-09 10:06:44
How is that "off chain"?
Local bitcoins (at least the one I know) is a decentralised offline exchange, but it is On-chain.
@_date: 2018-09-09 12:08:29
True - the bot still needs to pay fees. It will have limited effect.
But there is definitely harm in opening useless channels. Your money is limited. You can only open so many channels.
It is normal of me to assume that people would want to optimize for maximum routing potential, and collect more fees.
@_date: 2018-09-09 10:29:48
Thanks. Good answer.
@_date: 2018-09-09 09:48:44
I am asking seriously. No trolling.
The reason you care if it is a poor person or a bot is that a poor person opens a channel and receives money, while a bot opens a channel and just hangs there - blocking your money until you manually close the channel.
@_date: 2018-09-09 09:34:51
So you are saying that nodes will compete to open channels with poor people, because poor people have limited options to open other channels and can maybe be forced to pay higher fees.
But then that same competition would lower the fees.
Tell me more.
How do they know who is a real poor person and who is a spam Bot that requests channels with everyone (without locking money in the channels)
Will KYC be required for poor people?
@_date: 2018-09-09 10:09:18
That is interesting. I will research.
Thank you.
@_date: 2018-08-12 09:57:28
I know of a safe way to hard fork.
1 - make a user activated hard fork (no split)
2 - when enough users signal to be ready to fork - miners fork too
3 - if not enough users accept the hard fork - nothing changes. Their software is backwards compatible.
In early September I will talk on that topic in a Software School in my country.
There will be recordings too.
@_date: 2018-08-12 13:00:14
Not a thing untill someone does it. ;)
@_date: 2018-08-12 12:39:42
When creating a digital equivalent of something, you don't have to copy it's bad sides. You can copy only the good stuff instead.
Digital gold is not heavy because gold is heavy.
Gold is heavy because of physics. It just is.
The same physics do not apply on digital gold.
Why does Bitcoin need to be heavy too?
@_date: 2018-08-12 09:08:40
Interesting.  
Thank you!  
I had trouble finding the right number.  
That number is much better, but still not nearly as fast as needed.  
Would you agree 32 MB blocks would be needed in the next few years?  
Otherwise Lightning would simply hit a bottleneck.  
@_date: 2018-08-13 05:09:58
"Most of the time" is not good enough for units of exchange.
If you think that it is store of value, then moving it fast is not as important.
I think we already have a pretty good store of value in gold. making it digital is somewhat cool, but not that important. If I wanted store of value, I'd simply buy gold.
I think BTC should be like cash. Unit of exchange. I want to see it work all the time, and not just most of it.
(This is something I heard from A. Antoanopolis back in 2016 when I was first researching BTC. He said that Bitcoin is like cash in front of a big audience of Indian people. Why did this narrative change?)
Seriously - if BTC worked all the time and not just most of the time, I would have never switched to the other Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-08-13 07:14:38
That is true. It is indeed volatile.
@_date: 2018-08-12 09:03:46
I make this assumptions for a reason.
* Block size can change. The whole point of this post is to point why I want it to change.  
Also - Don't give me that s\*\*t about the 4 MB extension block.  
I am talking about Lightning transaction size being 900 bytes. Of course Lightning opening transaction on BTC would use SegWit. That is part of the calculation.  
If you want to correct me, find the exact size of the transaction. I am not completely sure it is indeed 900 bytes. Could be more, could be less.  
* I make the assumption that 7 BLN people need bitcoin, because they really need it.  
I agree that the blocks can't become big enough for all of them, so their only choice would be Lightning.  
But lightning too is not big enough for them.  
* The third assumption sounds interesting.  
Yes. It is possible to minimize the scripts for opening channels and reduce the time by a lot.  
I want that to happen.  
Consider this post as a motivation to implement such a change.  
* Even if lightning is only one tool of many, that changes nothing.  
You see - if you have 2 tools, both of them would need to settle their channels on Bitcoin, and both of them can only get a half of the block space.  
If you have 100 tools like Lightning, each will only get 1% of the space in the block.  
Having more tools does not solve the problem.  
@_date: 2018-08-12 09:26:52
That is the biggest problem with both communities:  
1 refuses to move the the limit up and do any hard forks,  
and the other believes that removing the limit would solve all the problems in the world.  
We obviously can't do 93 TB blocks.  
Impossible.  
But it is also obvious that we can't do Lightning with 1 MB.  
Even if you make the transactions smaller, you will make them smaller by percents, not by multiple times.  
Making them smaller is good, but not enough.  
I would gladly switch back to BTC if it was made to be usable right Now.  
For the moment I use the other one.  
When the other one hits it's own bottlenecks, I will decide what to do next.  
Maybe I will switch to a completely different thing... who knows.  
@_date: 2018-08-12 10:18:31
I agree on the basics.
I just don't agree that 32 MB would destroy these basics, or harm them in any way.
Can you direct me to something written by people who actually measured it. Maybe they can explain why the 1 MB number is so critical.
I see a lot of people talking about consequences of bigger blocks, but I haven't seen anyone explain it with math.
@_date: 2018-08-12 09:09:58
No. He is not a person who likes to admit being wrong, and I already did that in a few places.  
Still - the time needed is too long. Bitcoin needs to scale.  
@_date: 2018-08-12 09:30:37
Another person who misunderstands the intent of this post.  
My logic is not that there won't be new ideas, but that new ideas are needed. A lot.  
I am not saying "Lightning can't scale so let's kill it".  
I am saying "Lightning can't scale so let's fix it".  
@_date: 2018-08-12 08:39:54
Do you perhaps have a different result when you calculate the needed time?  
I am interested to listen to how you would calculate the needed time.
@_date: 2018-08-12 12:15:30


Why later?  
Fees are already more expensive than they need to be.  
Why wait?  
@_date: 2018-08-12 09:13:55
I am simply not patient enough.
I am 26 years old.
I want to see true world adoption before my hair turns white.
@_date: 2018-08-12 07:16:51
So bitcoin is now considered a luxury good?
How many percent of the people should open a Lightning channel?
1 % ???
It would take 2500 years for 1% to open channels.
So... you were saying?
@_date: 2018-08-12 08:52:55
Interesting question:  
7600000000 \* 50 = 380000000000 TX needed  
The size of a standard TX depends on the number of inputs mostly, but if I had to average it, I'd say.... 270 bytes. (most are 220, but many would need more than 1 input, so I am adding 50. This is a rough estimate)  
380000000000 \* 270 / 1024 / 1024 = 97846984.8633 Megabytes
97846984.8633 / 1024 / 1024 = 93 Terabytes  
This number is huge!  
That is why I do Not believe that Big Blocks are the one true answer.  
BUT!  
If BTC was to increase the block size to... let's say... 1 GB, then Lightning Network would actually stand a chance.   
1 MB block is simply not enough.  
@_date: 2018-08-12 12:34:37
Hard forks are forks that expand the rules.
If users accept broader range of possibilities but miners only mine by the the older tighter rules, then there won't be a split.
Technically it is not that different from a miner activated soft fork.
But it starts from the users instead from the miners.
