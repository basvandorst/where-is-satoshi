See my nam?  I know all about Ver’s ugly tactics and his bcash scams.
@_date: 2019-07-03 20:47:14
“Not a scam”
@_date: 2019-07-13 23:52:37
Mcclaren is awesome tho
@_date: 2019-07-06 06:17:54
This is a good one.
@_date: 2019-07-21 16:22:42
Yep, I think they have fake accounts like at least 30 of them to do upvotes and downvoted.  At least 15 is active for sure.
@_date: 2019-07-09 20:36:26
I sold it at 3.5k
@_date: 2019-07-09 20:43:03
Never forget the fact that Craig’s wrong and other bsv peeps were the reason why bcash started and why it was popular in the first place.  All the scammers got together and created money out of thin air and continued to scam people different ways.
@_date: 2019-07-10 00:42:31
Yep. This shit won’t last.  They tried too hard to topple bitcoin.  They’re a bunch of scammers
@_date: 2019-07-19 04:13:48
Alright, we need more women than old men in Congress.
@_date: 2019-07-14 05:34:44
Nah, why not going with the GTR?  I’m not going for speed tho.  As long as it’s exotic and quite reliable I’m good to go.
@_date: 2019-03-01 20:45:30
Yeah, except Bcash claimed themselves bitcoin.  They misled people into believing and buying bcash instead of bitcoin.  This is the definition of a lunatic. 
@_date: 2019-03-20 03:40:31
Can’t argue with that!
@_date: 2019-03-01 23:06:47
This article is misleading and the Bch should be in jail already.  
@_date: 2019-03-12 04:24:40
That’s how it works without the world knowing who behind it.  The USA controls the world.

@_date: 2018-10-15 01:03:56
Yeh, the probability of him guessing something right is like 1 in a million.  He’s produced nothing other than FUD and useless claims.  
@_date: 2018-10-11 21:41:20
Awesome.  I’ve been there many times.  I wasn’t sure.

@_date: 2019-03-16 18:17:17
The bch army will come to downvote this 
@_date: 2018-10-19 22:31:26
Wow, this is fantastic.  Thanks, mate!
@_date: 2019-03-12 04:23:12
Pretty sad to see.  Venezuela was fine then. 
@_date: 2019-08-16 17:01:44
Oh looks like they’re going to change their mind again when the date is near.
@_date: 2019-08-01 18:12:39
That’s what he intended to make people believe.  People panic seeing this and sell.  I’m sure he’s buying.
@_date: 2019-08-13 20:17:17
I hear something big is coming on the 15th.  I hope it is cuz it’s getting closer.
@_date: 2019-08-04 03:25:38
Bruh bruh!!! Let’s take it outside��
@_date: 2019-08-14 03:09:45
Last desperate operation by roger.  He’s been promoting it actively recently.  See how it’ll last.

How on earth can anyone think this dude is a good guy is beyond me.  You hear him speak and shit he does?
@_date: 2019-08-03 16:41:53
His criticism of the USA government I kinda agree.  
Then he went on to side with bcash and trash bitcoin.  That’s when I think this guy is nut and it’s all about himself.
@_date: 2019-08-03 18:31:05
Bruh this guy is insane.  It’s about himself and his money and fame.  The bcash fans need to realize that.  But I suppose they’re holding a huge bag of bcash.
@_date: 2019-08-11 15:13:04
Wait till these bcash losers lose all the money holding bcash bag.
@_date: 2019-08-04 03:31:40
The shit bcash was found upon fraud and by fraudsters.  The entire gang deliberately wanted to take over bitcoin but failed so far.  It’s crazy how many people wanna take over bitcoin, even the governments.
@_date: 2019-08-07 14:50:59
There would be another bank starts.  Who know this would give an opportunity for Walmart or any other corps to open a bank strictly for crypto.  
I don’t think the banks want that.
@_date: 2019-08-11 18:11:00
They started rolling out the ban since bcash in some serious shit day by day.
@_date: 2019-08-07 14:43:30
True.  Plus, they restricted my post and comment.
@_date: 2019-08-17 02:10:20
Only the exchange could.  We can spread to Binance etc.  People did but CZ didn’t do anything.
@_date: 2019-06-24 23:29:27
Roger is almost as bad as Craig’s wrong
@_date: 2019-06-01 02:59:02
Yeah like Roger Ver slaps an article from ccn on yahoo and claimed it was yahoo report about his debate.  People actually liked that.  Wtf is wrong with crypto.
@_date: 2019-02-08 21:33:54
Yet they delayed one after another.  It has got to be something bigger than just the manipulation.  
@_date: 2019-06-04 13:30:16
According to roger, it’s not bcash.  It’s bitcoin core problem.  Idk what btc core is.
@_date: 2019-06-18 13:48:12
It looks like a marketing store trying to sell something
@_date: 2019-06-04 05:24:43
Don’t post this on r/btc they’ll hate ya.
@_date: 2019-06-25 04:51:54
He name bitcoin as bitcoin core and spent his days everyday bashing bitcoin fees he’s got using bitcoin.com and other of his shady website
@_date: 2019-06-24 23:30:42
Actually there are a lot of new comers go there.
@_date: 2019-06-17 05:24:12
This is bitcoin cash people.  What are we talking about OP?
@_date: 2019-06-17 05:25:05
Bcash bcash.  This Amaury guy is the shithead for bcash.
@_date: 2019-02-23 18:46:19
Their subreddit is constantly bashing bitcoin.  This guy is a lunatic.  
@_date: 2019-04-18 23:53:53
@_date: 2019-04-25 01:56:02
Copied journals?  Hmm not sure.  He killed himself due to onerous shitloads from the government after he hacked one of the ivy leagues internal docs that made available to the public.
@_date: 2019-04-23 19:17:32
This is awesome!!
@_date: 2019-04-27 05:35:28
Sounds about Wright!!!
@_date: 2019-04-23 19:15:54
Please do.  For everyone!!!
@_date: 2019-04-13 07:03:18
Yeah, they were there cuz of the fork.  The exchanges got money too and they have to list it to sell.
@_date: 2019-04-03 03:11:21
Clap clap !!
@_date: 2019-04-13 07:00:36
Agreed but I now disagree.  The BCH and BSV have done more harm than helping the crypto community.  The bitcoin was, is and will always be under the attack from bch and bsv attack.
@_date: 2019-04-08 23:11:22
They’re fraustders
@_date: 2018-11-10 21:06:15
I was trying to send usdc from coinbase to Kucoin.  Got a message saying that the transfer is going to take 72 hours.  
@_date: 2018-11-05 06:32:12
It doesn’t state that there’ll be a 1:1 drop?  I know it’s a fork.  
@_date: 2018-11-29 03:40:24
Ooopse it’s just going back down.  Hope to see at 6k soon.
@_date: 2018-11-30 10:27:09
I never liked the CME.  
@_date: 2018-11-19 00:30:16
@_date: 2018-11-25 18:03:22
This has been posting a million times.  
@_date: 2018-11-26 18:24:00
If bitcoin ever hits 6k in an hour the entire net will follow suit buying.  
@_date: 2018-11-04 16:23:32
I hear there’d be no 1:1 airdrop for bch holders 
@_date: 2018-11-26 18:21:36
Wow, you’re an amazing mofo.  This actually made me smile lol.  
@_date: 2019-01-16 21:23:22
Can we hear no more of Venezuela? Lol
@_date: 2018-11-04 16:57:55
Well, I’ve got this from Binance chat where the admin stated they don’t support the 1:1 airdrop.  
@_date: 2019-01-22 03:42:26
How isn’t bitcoin $20k yet? 
@_date: 2019-01-02 04:53:55
After all these years we still don’t know who own the hitbtc.  
The owners/or whoever involve with the exchange know exactly where to hide and run lol.  
@_date: 2019-01-05 20:56:56
The big boys MasterCard, visa etc are coming after everyone.
@_date: 2019-01-20 21:39:59
Vote this up.  
@_date: 2019-01-16 00:29:47
We know.  The riches ain’t happy with the Poor having too much money.  
@_date: 2018-11-22 04:00:51
I totally agree with this.  An insurance is an important piece for many, whether or not you like.  
Any insurance token would be huge if it executed correctly.  
@_date: 2019-05-28 16:02:56
Crypto won’t but blockchain is here to stay.  Bitcoin maybe won’t be used  but it’ll def be here to stay as a valuable icon.  Don’t tell me the internet is going to die anytime soon.
@_date: 2019-05-25 00:57:49
Isn’t that mining pool for siding with bcash?  So they’re increasing the fee on btc?
@_date: 2019-05-13 02:39:21
You’ll hear a lot about high fees and low block argument lol.
@_date: 2019-05-23 00:31:02
This would make roger and his fans mad.
@_date: 2019-05-04 02:12:11
Sounds like that’s what the bcash is doing lol
@_date: 2019-05-25 22:35:42
Lmao can’t beat bcash fans they have like 30+ accounts plus spreading false news and monitoring their sub downvoting anyone says bad things about bcash.
@_date: 2019-05-01 00:10:59
I disagree.  Why would you wanna let this go?  We want to expose him.  We want him in jail.  This guy is toxic.
@_date: 2018-12-19 23:53:16
It hardly break the $4k part.  How’s this going to moon tho?  I’m waiting for it to break the $5k barrier then I’ll consider a moon.  
@_date: 2019-05-26 17:31:25
Go to btc sub.  Almost every post is about how bad btc is and it’s like at least 30 posts errday.  Said a thing against it there are at least 15 downvoters consistently.  A new high at 30 downvoters now.  Roger is like a rat hiring all accounts.
@_date: 2019-05-27 15:01:14
Same but I chose to stay to watch the talk about btc all day everyday.
@_date: 2019-05-26 17:44:37
Do you understand bcash on the technical side aspects of it?  It’s not bitcoin.  You’ll be disappointed once bcash becomes popular and find out it’s not what everyone thought it is.  Yeah, blocksize sounds great and is used against btc a lot.  
Aside bitcoin.  Why’d you wanna use an unlimited bcash over any other alts?
@_date: 2018-12-24 17:28:02
You don’t sound like one.  Try to look at the bitcoin codes and take some times to think about it.  
@_date: 2018-12-23 06:42:20
We know.  And more reasons why.  It’s okay. 
@_date: 2019-05-13 02:33:31
Do you realize that bitcoin.com is controlled by bcash.  Someone did an analysis of how this site jackup the fee for btc.
@_date: 2019-05-27 18:20:36
Good idea.  The thing is Bch is unlimited or going to.  Tipping a few cents by roger is nothing considering he’s going to have a majority stake with bch.
@_date: 2018-12-29 02:07:17
It is true.  Did try to transfer BTC out of Coinbase and it had a message of the 72h delay.
@_date: 2019-05-27 15:19:45
These people must hold a huge bag of bch.  Or I suspect most of the accounts with high karma are bought and owned by roger.
@_date: 2018-12-23 06:44:36
Personal expertise lol.
@_date: 2018-12-07 02:06:52
Forget about the SEC and move on!
@_date: 2018-12-11 01:42:17
Hahahah.  I’m sure they’re coming..
@_date: 2018-12-09 20:18:21
When will it be profitable to mine again so that the miners are coming back?  
@_date: 2019-05-28 13:53:09
Remember AOL doesn’t have the same development drive as Bitcoin.  And it was a corporate. Bitcoin is a continuation of work and more and more devs are eager to help.
@_date: 2019-05-26 17:36:59
If you go to bitcoin.com and click buy you’ll buy bitcoin cash automatically.
@_date: 2019-05-26 17:34:42
I thinks it’s a joke in response to bcash.  Neither is true.
