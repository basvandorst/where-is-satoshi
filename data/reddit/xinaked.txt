it does not avoid the 10k pizza risk what lol
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:22:33
right; but that's hindsight. he could have just rebought his 1000 btc after the pizza to avoid the risk (same net effect as using fiat)
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:46:59
100% true. herds of idiots downvotin you 
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:06:24
what? why wouldn’t you at least TRY? no harm in trying 
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:47:37
you realize it’s all relative 
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:26:30

lasts easily for one day, charge every night
dial is for controlling the interface, you can:
click dial
rotate dial
"force touch" main screen
these three interactions allow you to do everything. takes a little getting used to; but you figure it out.
@_date: 2015-12-05 03:46:15
yes, assuming you, the programmer, do not introduce any vulnerabilities 
@_date: 2015-06-05 20:34:22
Yes, it has touch 
@_date: 2018-05-21 16:39:42
at least you’ll never hit zero!

new iphone means increased productivity which means more $$$ cause of time saved 
it’s worth it. it’s like $200 yo upgrade each year and after a month of time savings it pays for itself 
@_date: 2018-05-21 16:00:11
you’d make more money betting on the price of bitcoin if you KNEW it would stay stagnant.

What's your favorite Css framework

"Nearly" free is so scammy sounding. Just say free. Bitcoin is 100% free to transfer value, tx fees are optional and withdrawal or exchange fees are the users choice. Bitcoin itself is 100% free value transfer 
@_date: 2014-10-04 18:21:54
I'm honestly not surprised you've lost it all
You are a gambler. Not a trader

as a bot programmer,
an order will be pulled after a certain time and either retargeted or not reattempted at all due to various things. 
there is no “secret hidden agenda” other than getting the best deal 
@_date: 2018-06-08 21:03:49
like what 
@_date: 2018-06-02 16:03:01
yea exactly. you pay this rentacop $500, he texts your details to a crew, they knock you for 75K toss the cop 10k
@_date: 2017-11-24 21:10:10
what? every all time high everyone that’s ever sold bitcoin has “lost money “
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:53:17
if someone had 10+ million trades in a year, how would they pay taxes on this?
@_date: 2018-03-19 18:37:05
the real question 
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:48:30
source? sounds interesting 
10 random darts in my backtesting does okayish but never beats simple strategies

@_date: 2018-02-23 18:17:00
not fud
@_date: 2018-02-06 19:44:02
why didn’t you just buy btc?
@_date: 2018-02-11 04:44:59
local bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-02-02 03:04:34
just “considering it” at this point? what does bofa have to kill your dog too before you will switch?
@_date: 2017-10-30 16:26:18
@_date: 2015-11-25 21:07:37
Yea... Literally no point to something like Bofa at that point 
@_date: 2015-03-14 18:20:53
