High transaction fees centralize Bitcoin into the hands of wealthy users. When lightning arrives, you're going to need to pay these SAME FEES to use a Lightning channel.

Any plans for Touch ID?

That's a crazy low price.

Lame is fine, (and I do think it should be called out) but Max is calling a fork of Bitcoin fraudulent and illegal, as though he wants to sue the CEO of Bitcoin Cash. He uses the example of Coca Cola brand infringement, but those rules just don't apply here.

If you find yourself in SF in need of Organic Vermont Maple syrup I'm your guy :) 
My go-to spot for spending BTC is beefjerky.com. I think I once spent what would now be several hundred dollars on a pound of 'spicy'.

You could become a merchant on Bitpay:  -- not sure about the legal implications of this (in fact, I feel like I'm walking through a fog whenever I try to wrap my head around legal interactions between Bitcoin &lt;-&gt; Dollars)

I have been feeling the same thing recently. Thanks for posting

Some general buzz I've been feeling. Sites like: 
And of course Satoshi Dice is one mature example, which resulted in the highest transaction volume in history - though many were micro transactions. 
Edit: Also --&gt;

I've always wondered how a wallet backup email is sent without the site knowing your private keys. Is this also encrypted somehow?

Also, you may want to make sure you don't have a sync archive - this ensures that deleted files are actually deleted from your machine. 
@_date: 2013-02-23 05:12:15
Interesting. 
Seems like an appropriate setting for this type of transaction (quietish and caters to a sophisticated SOMA crowd)

I was overwhelmed by the selflessness of you guys and gals after reading the maelstrom of charitable deeds on [shakethatbass’s thread]( so I thought I would bring your attention to a project that is near and dear to me. 
Adobe Books, an independent bookshop and gallery in San Francisco, was confronted with a major challenge in the form of a massive rent increase that threatened to close it’s doors forever. Rather than accept the fate of so many historic independent shops throughout the Mission District and close down, a group of dedicated members of the Adobe family decided to fight back in the form of a major fundraising campaign through [Indiegogo]( and a series of events in the shop and elsewhere. **There’s a show with the [Dodos &amp; Two Gallants on Monday]( ... and [art on ebay]( 
Adobe is a special place, and I want to keep it around!
If you'd like to help, I have setup a Bitcoin address and I will be adding money received to my own pledge on Indiegogo.  
If you have any coins to spare, use the tip bot or send to: 13ESufrbntNg6xoSajfH3NfXCxx6Y4ahkQ. (This is also displayed on the Indiegogo page so you know I'm not a Pirate.) 
I recommend getting in touch with Indiegogo and letting them know they should accept Bitcoin!
As many of you know, Indiegogo projects are not funded unless all the threshold has been reached. Right now we're at $36k/60, **with 6 days left**! Thanks for reading!

Thanks for your purchase! I made the site and honestly you are our first order :)

Just explain in detail to the MTGox folks your situation, and include any school attendance documents that may help. You might also want to ask if it would be better to link your home (not college) address to your account since it probably matches your driver's license's address.

At my company we use Expensify to reimburse for things like software purchases. I feel like this opens up some uncharted tax territory ( like most bitcoin endeavors) but I'm all for it.

I'll be lowering prices when I get home. I set the price at the same price it is sold at the farmers market plus shipping. Saves money to combine orders!  I'll let you know when prices have been lowered. 
Edit: Prices are now 30% off for both the pint and half gallon. 
@_date: 2013-03-23 21:13:28
Yes, but it gets pricey for that. Sometimes three times the cost of the syrup. 
@_date: 2013-04-28 00:59:32
I think it's a perfect fit. Get in touch with seed libraries and talk about it with farmers!

The purchasing page has a Coinbase payment button:  
@_date: 2013-02-23 05:16:00
I'll check it out. 
Btw-- are you using a throw away to ensure your Bitcoin-related comments are unlinked from the real world? And unlinked from any potential blockchain transactions?
I'm extremely curious about this topic, as there has been a disturbing silence from aml/ FBI forces on the topic of Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-01-23 00:23:03
Thanks! We're trying hard :) 
We just updated the purchasing page to make things easier: 
@_date: 2013-08-28 21:57:13
It looks like someone has created a Coinbase payment processing plugin for opencart:  (I have experience selling software with Coinbase and they're excellent)
@_date: 2013-07-20 23:16:42
When I used Coinbase to purchase something on Bitpay the payment did not reach the Bitcoin network for 20 minutes (5 min after the countdown) but the payment still went through. I recommend emailing Bitpay if your money is in the aether.

Thanks very much for featuring the site! My girlfriend's family's farm is located in Peacham, Vermont and we are excited to offer syrupy goodness to the Bitcoin community. 
I've just lowered prices 30%. The USD equivalent is:
$7.20 for a Pint
$26.59 for a Half Gallon.

If anyone would rather buy through bitcointip, send me a pm. To verify I am who I say I am, feel to send super secret passwords to the contact address on bitmit or blackpupmaple.com.

Seems they need to setup a SSL certificate, fix several typos, and get things together. Terms, FAQ, and information about the service should be available without logging in.
