Because they don't really screen ads.

I'll take them for free, and even pay for shipping.

Weird thought: in what situation does the dollar massively crash and/or crumble (almost certainly meaning that the economy as a whole is collapsing as we speak) but the gigantic infrastructure necessary for Bitcoin that is "the Internet" still completely functional?
Like, I'm all for Bitcoin. It's a fascinating tech, an incredible example of a blockchain at work on a massive scale, and an achievement unlike any other. It's an amazing way to get things completely away from banks and fees that do nothing but all of that economic-ly destructive jazz.
I just seriously can not imagine any kind of prepper shtf situation where the dollar is useless but the Bitcoin isn't. 
Inb4 "the government can just say it's not good anymore." that would work about as well as people deciding that Bitcoin is worthless.

Where did you get the CPU miner?

You know, I've actually thought about this. An interesting idea, for sure.

You know, I was thinking about how a Ponzi scheme worked and how I would do it, and I ended up at this model. Weird.

Thanks. I've been looking.

To be fair, I wouldn't really consider gold as "money". An object of value, yes, but not something that you can usually trade for goods and services. 
@_date: 2015-09-29 13:20:06
Yes, but where/who did the bitcoins come from? A bitcoin transaction is anonymous, so you can never really know.
@_date: 2018-04-05 13:02:20
You say that like gold doesn't have value for the exact same reason. What does gold's *actual value* come from?

How do they keep people from cheating the system if the algorithm is known?
Also, they could be lying. Nothing is "provably fair" if you think about it too hard.

It's kinda the same thing with the US dollar. I'm not into the whole "our economy is fucked and everyone that does things for money is evil" thing, but I find it interesting that the US dollar and the Bitcoin are backed by the same thing: our word. It has value because we as a market gave it (and continue to give it) value.

I meant the cycle thing. I'm gonna wait until it devalues a little bit from this congress media swirl thingy.

The standard lottery is a fair system as well. All "fair" means is that there is equal probability. So coin tosses (going to your sports question a little) are provably fair because each side has an equal side of winning.
That being said, it's not exactly unknown that casinos are unfair. For instance, the presence of the green "00" on the roulette wheel skews every probability towards the house.

I've heard it called the "Trusting Trust" attack. I like that name.

When did you make this link?

You do realize he was arrested because he called a hit on someone, right?
@_date: 2013-11-19 21:16:22
Fair enough.

I think that thinking physics currency will be replaced is silly.

Those are part of the charges, but they found him because of the hit

I currently have just over a mBTC from a bitcoin tip. I'm waiting to buy until this bubble bursts. I'd love to mine, but the best I have is a nVidia 650, which apparently would be shit for mining. It seems like getting a few eruptors would be good, but I'm not sure...
Maybe litecoins? Or getting an eruptor for those?
@_date: 2013-04-12 16:36:11
Delusional how? You didn't really give enough info.
@_date: 2013-10-02 17:58:10
I've looked over the court documents. It seems like, if they have the evidence to tie him to the online persona, they have a serous case and I don't think any of the charges were trumped up.
@_date: 2013-11-19 23:08:47
I know, right? Not nessesarily "crash", more "not going up like fucking crazy"
@_date: 2013-04-12 18:45:21
That's actually something I didn't think about. Very interesting. Then again, I don't pay taxes, nor have a fear of getting locked up. But it's an interesting thought that the dollar is "enforced" by taxes and the government.

I think you have a fundamental misunderstanding about how money works.
