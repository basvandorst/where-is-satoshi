Well this is interesting to see both Mcafee and Kim Dotcom arguing/talking. Next step is friendship :)

I will say most of the world trades basically fake tokens called stocks. Investing on a purely roi basis and value has long gone away and now its only about trying to run away from inflation due to to much printing. But I agree I wont gamble on things I can move around and have control over :)

Kinda need the Segwit for easy sidechains :P hence why BU is really just an attack of Bitcoin. Hard to say why but there intentions are clear they do not want crypto currencies to succeed anymore. This is not just a Altcoin vs Bitcoin thing
@_date: 2017-03-12 04:52:32
I do not agree with you Rowdy_beaver as BU wants to actually make the block size grow to something untested and not safe. From my experience as a systems engineer working and programming code that affects 10k+ servers for large businesses I can tell you that Segwit is much more tested feasible compared to BU. 
Tbh I think of concept of BU vs. Segwit/Core being the equivalent of a first time website designer with lots of money (BU) vs. the seasoned engineers at google working on self driving cars that we are all going to sit in and use tomorrow. No way in hell I am going to trust BU unless they are 100% clones of proven tested software.

Ty ^^. Due to too much work, coding, and not enough sleep, it seems I forgotten how to speak english.. 
@_date: 2017-03-12 05:01:23
Which is the point, what do they want then? I really think its related to political interests with money and is worded in a way that sounds great until you really think about it. Kinda like a good poizi or scam. So lots of good people following it, however, the real aim is most likely to try and derail bitcoin. 
This will unlikely happen do to bitcoin's growth being driven primarily by needs that will eventually lead to innovation and results. And no matter how political discourse is played out, bitcoin will continue to evolve as it always has. Just need one node, a miner, and someone willing to innovate on the code base to survive and excel.

shhh.... we need to hack  through logic. If their intent is not malicious we win if it is we win :) 
As they say on there site, 


Well no one said we can't be core/segwit/scaling supporters and propose  for BU.. unless BU is does not 'hear our voices'. Best way to call out the lie or hijack it to accelerate the scaling, imo. BU claims to want scaling so this does not go against their communities values, and it's not malicious to voice for  for scaling as its truly the best option

Yes now its becoming more of a energy limitation that makes bitcoin profitable. The mining technology is getting cheaper, so eventually it can decentralize again due to renewables.  However, if we raise the blocksize limit too much this will lead to increase network requirements which would add another factor that can give a competitive edge to large conglomerates. Proof of stake has similar problems in that you can just coop the network by having lots of money or by a sybil attack. This is much easier than mining as it can be based on fiat money alone and easy for a nation state or a multi-billionaire.
@_date: 2017-03-07 16:41:34
hence, why I wonder why BU does not support Segwit? Why is this a BU vs Segwit conversation. Maybe its time to demand BU to take on Segwit and scale. We can figure out the BU stuff later.

@_date: 2017-03-24 22:58:50
yep :) they will always attack the highest value you chain. The stakes have been there since the beginning, just the first time one is having some affect on the speculators
@_date: 2017-03-19 01:26:26
Yes you are correct, however, the balance is external eventually as failure to innovate will decrease the price. The static miners who do not innovate efficiency ( political/non-political) will be squeezed first. This leads to decentralization eventually.
IMO what is happening now is people over invested in the currency for gains without investing enough into the development of innovation both technologically and socially-politically. This is causing people who do not hold to wealth transfer to people who hold for none short term objectives. Either due to developing on the system or just realizing the development being done. 
Naturally, this increases stake into to new individuals or systems rebalancing gains and wealth and gives them more incentive to work. The redistribution can happen indefinitely if no improvements are made. However, its kind of natural selection way of increasing diversity until something rebalances the system. Eventually it will create something and that will prosper. 
This happens in world economics as well, however, due to centralization, they can only work to a current threshold, as rules and adaptation to scenarios is limited to what the people in power think is best.
***To achieve positive results past this you need value/reward feedback loops that can be:*** 
* More atomic ( risk reward being sybil attacked Ex. lobbying or gamed Ex. Financially or criminally ) 
* More decentralized ( risk rewarding value disproportionate to people closest to the printing press, Ex. politics now ) 
* More diverse ( innovation in capital raising and ways it can be used Ex. micro transaction rewards, smart contracts, crowd funding ) 
***TL;DR/Translation:*** Build communities, software, and any form of innovation that networks with  :) Be adaptive and keep providing value. 
***Answer to OP question:*** yes there are some methods but focus less on value and more on strengthening the the system and voice of people who are acting intelligently ^^

Just temporarily news fud, but besides that not much.  would instant upgrade to segwit once we get rid of those stubborn BU miners :)
@_date: 2017-03-24 21:36:43
At this point the damage of a change split is already happening both politically and economically. Upgrading will allow for so many types of new code and development to take place. This provides huge economic boost in Bitcoins capabilities! 
I prefer going on using flag day  
IMO, we are under attack by BU like we have always been, bitcoin moving based on action like flag days is more in its nature. I feel these blocksize debates are becoming to political, and we all know its politics and centralization that is the problem. A hive mind move with segwit of miner, nodes, users, and exchanges will win if we put some stake behind it. 
@_date: 2017-03-12 05:02:44
A bit scary fact, but also exciting as this is really what humanity is at its core.
@_date: 2017-03-20 01:10:36
Your impling one version side would be left, however, historically not even the scammiest alt coin can die. I feel lots of the BU is sock puppet and good propaganda that turns people who do not understand bitcoin and its communities fully. 
@_date: 2017-03-25 22:24:28
Nah as there wont really be any other viable chain :P Maybe litecoin

Buy on Uphold its cheaper if your accumulating. No fee unless you transfer out more than 3 btc a week I think. And the price is usually lower.

Yep nice job Guardian... either the Bitcoin companies are being two faced or you just fabricated news based opinion alone. I expect blogs to get it wrong like this sometimes not business that does news to pay its bills.

From my observation, BTC price likes to retrace and check out the bottom: 
*(This is where the Whales hang out :O )*
* Scenario 1: 682 -&gt; 672 ; 689 -&gt; 678 ; New high 699 around the 19th. Rinse and repeat. 
* Scenario 2: Could just moon if demand peaks lol and if whales squeeze some shorts. Bid Floor is moving up from 600 to 640. Ask Ceiling is pretty thin.
Overall though, just buy a bit mORE at any local lows and HOLD THE DOor from these guys! [The BTC Bear Whales](
They want you to sell so they can accumulate more :)
@_date: 2016-07-07 07:04:25
Made me think of the bear whale :)

Also, isnt steemit basically instamined and is using fake accounts to boost popularity on search engines etc? I know their marketing says otherwise but lol. Be careful use your own judgement, however, big red flag after reading through many posts on a this thread on bitcointalk.org.

Hey lol at least they called you, I can never get a live person on the phone with any company :) I agree the interface is a bit wonky and confusing, this is probably due to language barrier in designing the website.
Okay to withdrawal funds ( for anyone else having problems ):
Ignore the verification prompt for level two. I have the same thing.
Make sure your funds are all in btc and in spot account.
First Check your futures account:
Trade -&gt; BTC Futures: Click on on 'Fund', verify all btc is in Spot Acccount. 
Next, check your Lending account.
Account -&gt; Lending: Click on 'Transfer', verify all btc is in Spot Acccount.
If you hover your mouse over the arrow on the top right of this page next to deposit you can verify where your funds are at on all balances.
Finally, withdrawal.
Account -&gt; Withdraw -&gt; BTC Withdrawal: The amount available that you can withdraw is there. Also, if you just deposited you need to wait 6 confirmations to be able to withdraw those funds.  
If this helps tip me sometime :D 
Also, most btc exchanges are sketchy. Bittfinex has been questioned for some insider trading. Most, btc counter parties probably do fractal reserves. You kind of have to pick the lesser of evils and keep funds with counter parties to a minimum if you're not using there services. If we do not do that then it makes the cryptocurrency we own less rare.

Regardless of your opinion, the strawman sock puppets love the 'bahhs' of their sheep being the top comment and top news article helping support their agenda :D
To be honest I actually do not know how communities can really defend against them in a world where we can make unlimited accounts.
@_date: 2016-07-20 16:47:33
If your talking about just spot checking prices tradeblock is not bad, however, does not include all exchanges and  so you miss the best of the arbitrage trades, however, I use it a lot for tracking price :) 
Also, of course fees are calculated manually, which eat up lots of positions. You can make a couple percentage a month which is not bad, however, bank transfers take forever, and if you're someone with not too much capital it really can kill profits.
Good luck though we need more arbitrage trading to help cut down manipulation and stabilize price. I am more interested in tracking reserves vs orders on these exchanges.  
@_date: 2016-07-23 05:21:49
Did you invest in any futures? If so and you profited and the contract has not expired, you cannot withdrawal earnings until then. Another reason is if you have not moved btc to spot trading account. Third could be that you have a loan out for the corresponding amount.
You do not need the second verification, it just asks for it and does not mean you need to fill it out. Never, had a problem though with okcoin, they even will call you and talk to you to verify you make changes security wise. Been using them about a year too and make deposits and withdrawals daily.
@_date: 2016-07-25 03:33:11
I wish there was a comment section or a way to counter troll this fudster with another news firm :( They produce so much of this and they never get called out mainstream wise. Basically, pushing the sheep away from an actually good coin btc that can actually help solve lots of the problems of chronic printing of money and even the playing field. Ug makes me frusterated...
