You got 21 sessions open. Might want to close them.

Why is the address not posted anywhere?
@_date: 2014-03-21 04:22:21
Yes, I understand that. However, I did not see it in the story. Perhaps, I overlooked it.
Edit: I was looking at the links in first response. I'm not smart.

Kind of crazy reading his posts. He probably had no clue shit was about to hit the fan.
@_date: 2013-11-18 01:40:21
Yes. That was my point. But everyone is in such a big uproar over that.
@_date: 2013-12-01 06:54:38
Seems pretty easy.

You fucked up. You should have given her, her half to begin with. Perhaps even had her input when you sold the assets. You played and blew it, give her the rest.
@_date: 2013-11-26 01:16:54
They seem pretty active on their page. So let's hope. There is a few places 1 street south of them that accept it.

If only he had to show his real name in the comments. Then all his friends could laugh in his face.
@_date: 2013-11-22 18:25:23
So you're just a selfish, cowardly, asshole. Well, it all makes sense now. Case closed!

I'm changing phone soon. Will this be an issue with my accounts that have 2fa with Google Auth?
@_date: 2013-12-01 07:50:13
Download app and enabled it in Google.
@_date: 2013-11-23 06:08:31
They probably had enough orders to exceed their limits everyday until Friday. Only thing I can guess.
@_date: 2013-11-22 05:52:20
I don't. I'll buy more at a lower price because I know it will go way back up over that price. 
@_date: 2013-11-14 06:38:24
I have one of these signs...not sure where I'd use it as a ticker though. lol
@_date: 2013-11-25 01:11:55
and that's why he's Bad Luck Brian. He was forgotten.

I misread, but it was worth 11million in April. Still said nothing about investing 11 million. But IDC either way. More money than I'll ever have. Lol
@_date: 2013-11-24 04:12:14
Yes, price will drop. People cashing out to buy presents with all their profits.
@_date: 2013-12-01 06:50:29
Well, I'm familiar with Titanium Back up. Not sure If i'll be able to root my new phone Galaxy S4. I guess just printing them out is the best. OR just disable it temporarily and set it back up after I get my new phone set up.
@_date: 2013-11-13 06:59:59
They didn't invest $11 million. They bought at $9 and it is now worth $11 million. Winkelvoss twins.
@_date: 2013-12-01 07:00:54
This sounds the easiest, IMHO. I'm not gonna freak out if it's not enabled for 5-10 minutes. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 22:50:15
I asked my Aunt about accepting it at RonToms (600 E. Burnside)...her and her son Ron own it. She said she didn't think there was a market. Maybe if people start going in and asking. :-)
@_date: 2013-11-25 01:13:14
I'm 33. I'd like to just come across 10k. heh Hell even 5k!
@_date: 2013-11-28 20:52:26
I'm not usually into art, but these paintings are very nice.
@_date: 2013-11-23 05:42:57
All week they said you would get it at market price on Friday 11/22 as they exceeded their daily limits. People need to pay attention to what's posted on the website.
@_date: 2013-12-01 07:21:50
True, I never thought about that before. I was going to make this phone stock and give it to my mom when I got the GS4. Big time mess up if I didn't think about the 2FA. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 06:30:26
Is the 2fa tied to my Google account rather than my phone.... So all I have to do is login to app from new phone?
@_date: 2013-12-13 06:31:16
It is only 100$ now.
@_date: 2013-11-22 17:54:26
She is 17. A minor which can't make legal binding decisions. However you were in a verbal agreement with whoever you inherited from. Verbal agreement between adults is more binding than any agreement made with a minor.
