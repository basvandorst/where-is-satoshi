Hopefully legit this time. Thanks for the reply.

Lol that guy absolutely owned HIMSELF. Nice one! xD

Great point. Not getting hopes up, just figuring out what to do in case it is legit.

Speak for yourself, "bud".
Apology unaccepted.

I don't think it will be possible to convert fiat into BTC, but hopefully.

I am talking about the recent update ( from yesterday, not the one from before claiming 5-10 days.

I buy and sell a lot on LocalBitcoins. They use escrow for all trades which means if there is an issue, they will find out who is telling the truth. Coinbase requires identification and you need to wait until your identity is confirmed before you can withdraw.

Since the US gov has access to the hotwallets &amp; BTC-e the coldwallets, is there any chance one or both would enable withdrawls?
Could we not prove account ownership by verifying our email, at least?

The discount was often over 10%. It all makes sense now.

I could clone this site by hand in a few hours...

In hindsight, my comment is quite naive. I think the only way we get our money back is if BTC-e opens up in 5-10 days for withdraws, or something like that.

It is *always* a good idea to buy Bitcoins. Since 2011, the price has went from just $3, all the way to $3,000!
