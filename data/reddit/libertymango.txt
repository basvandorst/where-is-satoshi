Thank you for sharing! Appreciate it a ton. Our aim is to showcase this technology and Bitcoin in general through a fun cultural lens. We're going to make an in-depth video next on how to actually set up a lightning node. (baby steps first) :)

yup - there's Bitcoin Association Switzerland [

haven't been there, saw they had a lightning talk recently so figured its dev-oriented. Not sure of anything like this meetup closer to Switzerland.

Does btcpay have a debit card? 
@_date: 2019-02-05 20:52:06
Very true. I'm assuming worst case scenario where the wallet provider wasn't following standards. But agreed, great website!

Is there any evidence it’s trivial? You would have to scan over a ton of addresses. Making a bitcoin address takes time then checking the index of utxos. And then you have to do it for every branch of the path. Quite sure from my experience it would take a ton of time for each wallet restore. You also aren’t sure of what number to use for each branch of the derivation path.

I’m a huge fan of btcpay and opensource. But highlighting the point there is different markets for transacting with btc. Agreed. Btcpay will never have a debit card. I think some people need the debit card as a transition into understanding Bitcoin.

this is neat, thanks for sharing 
@_date: 2019-02-05 01:51:45
Right, except not every wallet is able to be fully open source. 
@_date: 2018-07-09 20:06:02
Thank you, this was very helpful! I'll follow up with all of them

It's been proven that bitcoin does not thrive in chaos. Things like trade wars that cause actual harm to people shouldn't be touted as good.
