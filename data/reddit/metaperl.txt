No, what you are not aware of is an organization that has large holding in precious metals and oils. They will be forming an international purchasing network where the medium of exchange is their holdings in gold and oil, instead of declining fiat currency. The organization already has millions of dollars committed in investment and is rapidly growing here and in Asia.
I wont discuss them publicly. Only after I know you well personally.

There seem to be many add-on usages of the blockchain. bitmessage and this for instance. I wonder how easy it will be to keep the blockchain on disk with all these added usages.

Can you elaborate on what you mean here? As far as I know ghash is the cloud mining aspect of CEX.io. Why would they be taking earned bitcoins and gambling with it?

It actually [is]( a medium exchange, and growing in that direction rapidly.

It only takes one counter-example to make a statement false and I provided it.


I'm not making generalities. I'm providing specific evidence to show that gold is in fact a medium of exchange. And not only via the link I showed you there. But another organization as well that I know of.
