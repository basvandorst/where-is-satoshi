So far looks pretty good. I have a few questions...
1) saw some buzz about trezor support coming. Please also consider ledger/hw-1/btchip support.
2) also saw that importing another BIP32+BIP44 wallet isn't possible yet but is planned. What about the reverse... Is there a way right now to take a backup from Copay and import to another wallet? 
3) if I encrypt my private keys locally, what sort of encryption is used? I'm also assuming the passphrase is used for the encryption/decryption. Or is it combined with some salt? Or hashed? Just wondering how easy it would be to brute force the encrypted private key if someone got a hold of the file or the device.
4) this may be a dumb question, but making a new wallet is truly a new wallet yes? That is, a lot of wallets let you make new "accounts" in the same wallet but does this make an entirely new wallet?
Sorry if any of this is clear once you read through the source code. It's not something I'm able to do. The extent of my coding prowess is something along the lines of "Hello World" in BASIC.
Edit: and one suggestion. Please consider distributing through F-Droid.

There are an awful lot of variables in this. Some of which change all the time. Off the top of my head: electricity cost (can change often), difficulty (changes approx every 10 days), XBT-USD exchange rate (constantly changing)... And maybe other things if at home like do I need to run my a/c more when mining? Can I run my heat less when mining?

At this point I'm generally curious but also keen on arguing my point. How is this different from gift cards? They operate like money in certain environments, do not have legal tender status, and can be purchased with "currency."
@_date: 2014-10-08 04:14:54
I find it funny how they say high risk but they don't specify what kind of risk. Risk that you're a fraudster? Risk that they'll not make back the USD difference between when you bought and when the money came over from the bank? Risk that even after the fee the transaction won't prove profitable? 
Nice lesson in how to be vague but still appear altruistic...
@_date: 2014-09-12 23:42:27
Yeah I wouldn't be too concerned unless the buyer, during or before the transaction hints explicitly that he is doing this to launder money or to run stolen credit cards or something. If that happens you're either being set up in a sting operation or actually aiding and abetting a really dumb criminal. There's literally no reason to come out and declare your intent fir illegal activities unless you're seeing someone up for a sting or you're a huge idiot.
There is another concern about needing to have a money transfer license or some such thing, but my impression is that for smaller transactions it's not a big deal. 
If course I am not a lawyer and none of this advice should form the entire basis of your decision making process... Also if you get thrown in jail don't come blaming me.
@_date: 2014-08-21 02:27:18
Well I sent it from my acct at an exchange to my mobile wallet. It showed up on the mobile wallet pretty quick but Sat there unconfirmed for about 40 min.

You could have multiple addresses within one wallet or multiple wallets. Best practice would be multiple wallets. Note you can use various software like mycellium to track balances of multiple addresses in multiple wallets.
@_date: 2014-10-06 22:05:27
Unfortunately I tend to agree. Luckily I don't have much skin in the game. the only glimmer of hope in my mind is that they actually sponsored the bitcoin car and I heard interviews with folks actually involved with the bitcoin car and with bitcoin trader. Ah well only time will tell.
Too bad because TBH I feel like a non-ponzi version of this could work, given the ridiculous volatility of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-09-13 12:23:59
As others have said, the transaction will be irreversible, like sending cash in the mail, but without the danger of it being lost or stolen (or the recipient claiming lost or stolen).
You might try using an escrow service like btcrow if this makes you nervous, but if they're willing to send to you first then you pay, the risk is entirely on them anyway.
@_date: 2014-12-23 01:03:37
Is there any advantage to using an HD wallet for cold storage vs. a regular BIP-38 encrypted wallet? (paper wallets in either case)
@_date: 2014-10-08 03:32:13
That article predates BIP 0044 so maybe it was fixed. Just wanted to explain the article.
Can you point specifically where BIP 0044 addresses this though?
EDIT: what you are looking for is actually in BIP 0032 but didn't entirely remove the vulnerability. It still states:
One weakness that may not be immediately obvious, is that knowledge of the extended public key + any non-hardened private key descending from it is equivalent to knowing the extended private key (and thus every private and public key descending from it). This means that extended public keys must be treated more carefully than regular public keys. It is also the reason for the existence of hardened keys, and why they are used for the account level in the tree. This way, a leak of account-specific (or below) private key never risks compromising the master or other accounts.
@_date: 2014-09-13 00:43:13
Yeah I mean I guess I don't understand why three would be a fundamental difference between selling bitcoin or selling gift cards or gold bars.
@_date: 2014-09-12 23:55:29
If it can be proven in a court of law that you knew this was taking place before/during the transactions, then yes. 
But you know if you're the Vatican or a big wall street bank you wouldn't have to worry even if that was the case.
@_date: 2014-10-08 20:38:44
Posted a bunch of relevant questions here (more so about HD wallets than mycelium itself): 
What I've really boiled down my line of question to is: is there a way to have password/passphrase protected HD wallet seeds (conceptually similar to BIP 0038 cold storage wallets)? This would provide 2-factor security for offline cold storage HD wallets. Or am I not understanding completely and this is not really necessary?
@_date: 2014-12-28 13:02:43
I waited tables for years. Good waiters don't interrupt their tables' conversations... They join/add to them at opportune times. Sounds to me like that's what happened here.

How do I do the passphrase?
@_date: 2014-10-08 02:23:30
Giving out the master public key and a child private key is not secure. Having them both should allow someone to derive the master private key. This should be a non issue for most users who are basically just using it for their personal wallets I think.
@_date: 2014-12-09 22:20:22
No because credit cards are not analogous to bitcoin. Cash is analogous to bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-08-21 02:38:08
I mean I didn't really care in this case and yeah in theory if I was say sending a big chunk of money to someone say overseas I wouldn't care if it took an hour (since the alternatives are more expensive or take longer), but yeah I can't imagine waiting 40 minutes for confirmation of a transaction to buy a slice of pizza, for instance.
@_date: 2014-10-06 20:04:47
For their sake I hope they take this into account. Assuming it isn't a ponzi scheme and it really is arbitrage trading, I think we can assume or hope they were setting aside some amount of the arbitrage trading revenue to run their business and plan for contingency and this is where they might need to dip into that.
@_date: 2014-10-08 03:18:05
Have seen before of course and they look really nice, but I'm ok with my current setup.
@_date: 2014-09-12 23:47:09
I'm pretty sure bitcoin is supposed to be the digital equivalent of cash, not credit card, which is why I compared it to cash.
@_date: 2014-10-08 12:29:26
Yeah that's kinda my point. I thought I saw reference to passphrases in something I read about BIP 32, 39, or 44, but I can't find it now.
I suppose you could leave one of the 12 words out of the "backup" but that's a little closer to security through obscurity and is probably very easy to brute force.
@_date: 2015-05-04 17:27:17
If you believe in the long term value and if you can buy with pre-tax funds (aka 401k or IRA), someone looking for high risk/high reward could easily justify the purchase.
@_date: 2015-05-16 17:03:52
That doesn't make sense. If you pay for the solar equip, costing any number more than zero dollars or euros or rubles, then you mine using only energy generated by that equipment you will eventually break even and profit. If the solar provides the power at an upfront cost then an ongoing cost of zero (do you pay for sunlight?) then it seems logic would dictate you wouldn't be more in the hole than the upfront cost, except for any regular maintenance on the solar rig. Am I missing something? 
I suppose if you got fancy and factored in the opportunity cost of not selling electricity back to the grid you would possibly lost money on an ongoing basis, but that depends on how much the grid reimburses you.

As a miner, I value a bitcoin at about $300. It costs me around $250 to mine a bitcoin and I'd like to profit at least 20%.
This will of course change with difficulty changes.
Also I think I'm probably in the mid range in terms of efficiency of my equipment. I'm also probably slightly above average in terms of cost of electricity.  The reason I mention these two things is that other miners will value bitcoin differently based on these factors and how they calculate the amount of bitcoin they take per watt burned.
@_date: 2015-05-06 23:51:53
Well yes I would expect that as well. But I would also expect the DEA wouldn't be seizing cash from someone without charging them with a crime.

So, I do agree that a keylogger attack is possible with a rooted phone, but I think with sufficient encryption that should be the only attack vector. If a customized, randomized key layout was implemented, it should mitigate this vector for the most part. The only attack vector then would be full screen recording of display and touch events then related to a human being reviewing the recordings, translating it into a pin or passphrase, then using that to decode an encrypted payload which would also need to be obtained remotely. I very much like that samurai PIN is not stored though. 
I do understand your hesitance regarding private keys on a rooted device, but it is something that should be addressed and samurai wallet seems like the project to at least take it into consideration.
I will also mention, for example, Wallet32 which uses a PIN to encrypt private keys via scrypt algorithm. When setting the PIN in tells you the theoretical cost to crack that PIN encrypted private key file. For instance, using a 20 character pin would require approximately over a million dollars of computing power. Uncrackable? No. But by the same token, no safe is uncrackable... And, given enough tries, someone could guess your social security number, your driver license number, and your birthday.

@_date: 2015-05-16 17:32:55
Well in that case it just depends what hardware you are running.
If you buy an S5 and don't pay for electricity (because, solar), and assume it doesn't break in a full year, you'll break even on the miner in 5.57 months at current exchange rate. If you're only factoring in current numbers I think it's around 22 years to pay for the solar rig using only the bitcoins it generates. As you said, it a likely the miner doesn't last 22 years.
The cost of a new miner once the S5 were to breakdown would add 5 months per unit at today's price to the equation, so just off the top of my head if technology doesn't increase and costs all remain the same (or if you pre bought miners today to use as replacements down the line) and assume each miner lasts 2 years, then you're closer to the 25-30 year range of breaking even. 
I'm not saying this is a reasonable thing to do for the average person to do. And certainly it makes a LOT more sense to take all that money and just buy bitcoins. But it is theoretically possible.
@_date: 2014-09-17 23:23:23
I haven't had a problem getting money out.
@_date: 2014-09-14 13:44:59
True. Just don't need to bolster the idea that you can cash out on stolen credit cards by easily purchasing bitcoin through any established or reputable US-based service like coinbase. 
AFAIK there is no easy way in the US to buy bitcoin with credit cards... stolen or otherwise.
@_date: 2015-05-31 03:26:50
I didn't take an exact measure but it took a really long time (like maybe a week). Also I see others suggesting torrent for the bootstrap, but the devs actually discourage that now and say letting the client itself sync will be faster or as fast.
@_date: 2015-05-09 13:29:13
How many characters can the PIN be? Is it stored in the clear on disk anywhere? And how is the samurai data encrypted on disk? Does it use the PIN to en/decrypt or does it use something else? All of this is important to know if one plans to use samurai on a phone that's rooted.
@_date: 2015-05-16 15:38:47
If you're running off 100% solar it seems to me it would just be less profitable, not unprofitable, right? I understand selling that electricity back to the grid would be more profitable, but saying unprofitable is misleading.

DO NOT USE MYCELIUM IF YOUR PHONE IS ROOTED.
It stores the PIN in plaintext which is normally inaccessible outside the app, but if your phone is rooted, all bets are (theoretically) off.
If your phone is rooted, Wallet32 is your best bet (as far as I can tell), but only if you use a sufficiently long PIN (14+ characters). Wallet32 doesn't have the best UI, but I find it usable.
NOTE: I've not specifically heard of  malware exploiting root access and plaintext storage of a PIN and subsequent manipulation of Mycelium, but it seems like a glaring theoretical weakness.
NOTE2: if you use Wallet32, don't write down your seed mnemonic, and forget your PIN, you will be completely SOL if you want to recovery any bitcoin stored there.
NOTE3/Edit: if you're unfamiliar with why storing bitcoin on a rooted device might be dangerous, then don't store bitcoin on a rooted device!

Oh yeah I totally agree and to be clear I wasn't bashing Mycelium. It's probably my favorite wallet for android. I'm anxiously awaiting btchip/hw1/ledger support in production.
I would make the point, though, that storing PIN in plaintext creates (in my opinion) a much easier attack vector for a rogue app with root access, or even just a user who finds your phone and knows how to use a root explorer. All of the other attack vectors you mentioned are possible of course but to me (and I'm certainly no expert) they seem less likely.

Maybe, but trying to innovate and be first to market with something like this or trezor puts you at a huge disadvantage because something like bwallet can happen. Sure you can hope people will stand behind the original, not the copycat, but it all comes down to price at some level. In a sense it's a little like the generic vs. original drug model. There is a ton of r&amp;d cost that needs to be recouped. Second actors are at a strong advantage because their r&amp;d cost is comparatively minimal.
If a company were to hold some portion closed but reviewable under NDA by trusted third parties for a period of time, while promising to open source the entirety of the product (hardware &amp; software) at a later date-and actually followed through-I think that company would gain a lot of trust in the community...

Slippery slope from A to C
A) all money is not guilty, belongs to the person who earned it and they can do what they please with it (within legal framework of course)
B) some money is guilty and ownerless because it was obtained through illegal means, and this money can be seized because law-breakers forfeit rights (including rights to own property/money)... but other money is still not guilty
C) all money is guilty and no one has the right to own any of it. Therefore government owns all of it and will decide who can and cannot use money to transact and store value.

You shouldn't make statements without checking their truth. A lot of people think cloud mining contracts are pretty much just ponzi schemes at best, complete scams at worst. I don't think either ponzi scheme or scam describes the services for sale on toom.im.

OK that's a fair point re: freezing funds, but if I am understanding lightning right, aren't you still "trusting" a series of less-centralized payment channel contract bitcoin transactions. I suppose trust is the wrong word maybe because a non-trustworthy bitcoin transaction isn't really a thing (except unconfirmed RBF enabled transactions I suppose).

I don't think it's confusing. If, just before the seizure, the agents observed the suspect give you a crisp 500$ USD in cash (let's say 20$ bills) in exchange for your wrinkled 500$ USD in cash... Don't you think they'd seize your money as well? Or do you think they'd be super nice and give you back your wrinkled bills?
Just speculating but at that point, your bills are "guilty" as well. So if you can't exchange your originally "non-guilty" bills for the suspect's "guilty" bills without expecting the need to treat the new bills any differently, how is the cash still fungible?

Option 3, unless power companies accept bitcoin directly, is to have a higher exchange rate. Last I ran the numbers for my mining rig to be breaking even on a daily basis, I need difficulty to go down like 31%, exchange rate to go up 31%, or aggregate power cost to drop 28%. It's not surprising all the required changes are around the same %.

Still incorrect in my opinion. If my coins are in a wallet where the key was generated offline and has never been online, then they are safe. Proper security measures will keep your bitcoin safe from everything except maybe a lead pipe attack (aka, threat of physical violence or harm to reveal pin/password). Even then, multisig can mitigate a lead pipe attack to some extent.
We are getting way off topic here though.

I can appreciate the sentiment, but I think there are a few equivocations here...
To some people, maybe Luke-jr, "bitcoin" != "Bitcoin" and maybe the word user isn't the best term. Using bitcoin(s) does not make you a fully contributing user of Bitcoin.
I do agree that the more full nodes the better, but I also agree it isn't the most straightforward process.
As others have said here, this is a little like saying without running your own bank (or possibly without running your own branch of the federal bank) you aren't really a US dollar user. I think this is a bit of a stretch, but it could be a useful analogy to highlight just how much power individuals have within Bitcoin... By running a full node on modest hardware you can participate as much as a branch of the fed to some extent.
Overall, I really don't think this is a matter of tyranny or whatever OP is trying to rustle everyone's feathers about...

Luke is right here. There are blacklists that stop email at the relay level well before it hits your inbox for local filtering. It really sucks if you are incorrectly added to one though.
Luke is also right in terms of bitcoin. A miner can include or leave out whatever transactions it wants (sometimes they even mine empty blocks). However, assuming the tx fee paid is more than zero, market forces predict that some miner somewhere will include the corresponding tx.
@_date: 2015-07-16 18:33:04

That presupposes that you can identify spam as such.
Assuming you could, perpetuating spam via the blockchain doesn't harm anyone or anything once that first block is mined (save a few MB or GB on archival nodes). I guess I should clarify that IF you could reliably identify spam as spam, the object of blocking it would (to me) seem to be to reduce tx fee and make it so generally considered reasonable tx fees don't suddenly result in multi-hour or multi-day delays for first confirmation.

As others have mentioned, raspberry pi2 is sufficient. I have mine running with a 300GB external hard drive for storing the blockchain and to hold a swap file (which effectively increases memory capacity).
There is another similar single board computer called the ODROID C1+ that I would actually recommend over the raspberry pi2. About the same cost but is a bit faster. Setup should be roughly the same though.
Edit: as others have mentioned and I'd like to emphasize... You can run a full node on a lot of things. Old computers laying around and such. The advantage to something like a raspberry pi2 or an ODROID C1+ is it uses less power to run, but of course there's the upfront cost of new hardware.

Actually what I meant by "fee market" is that you can pay more to get your transaction confirmed faster. What the OP link concluded is that this really isn't true past a certain extent. 
Now of course I know, as you said, that the speed of blocks can't be changed by fees. 
And I think you hit the nail on the head on this being different from normal economics. If you extend my definition of fee market above, the good in the market is space in next block. But the production of this good cannot be increased or decreased freely. There is a limit of 1 MB (block size can be decreased and often is, but at a direct negative impact to miner revenue).
So supply curve is flat but the law of demand says higher prices, less demand. 
Now bitcoin isn't in in a vacuum and isn't the only game in town either. If the cost to get in the next block gets exorbitantly high, people will skip bitcoin for other methods of moving value. And I don't mean altcoins. I mean sticking with traditional systems. 
Low cost of transactions is one advantage bitcoin has and cannot afford to lose if the eventual goal is wide spread usage.
Realistically, there should be no block size limit and market forces should control it. That way the supply side of the fee market could actually move and you could still have low fees and fast transaction confirmations and lots of miner revenue. 
Of course if your goal (not you specifically but "you" in general) isn't fast, cheap transactions leading to wide spread adoption, then you wouldn't want to increase block size at all. 
Maybe (and this is of course speculation here) the small block camp doesn't have fast transactions, cheap transactions, or wide spread adoption as a goal. For example, Peter Todd is in that camp I believe and he said (on a podcast... Can't remember which) that he cares more about decentralization than cost of transaction.

Well yeah not all the mining pools, wallets, etc are on board. But also lots of core devs theorize that block size limit increases will lead to centralization, among other negative side effects. Although that's not necessarily proven.
@_date: 2016-02-25 17:58:48
Yep. Currently it's like a bus line that runs on tips. 
- Bus fits 50 ppl. 
- riders pay what they want
- 50 riders pay $1
- 51st rider wants to get on this bus, not the next one and pays $2
- one of the $1 riders is forced to give up seat
- that rider also wants to get on this bus, not the next, pays extra $1
- another $1 rider is kicked off
- repeat over and over... If all riders want to be on this bus, not next, price will increase until bus leaves, at which time someone will be left out and have to get on next bus. 
- if you are unwilling or unable to keep up with the price increase race, you'll never get on a bus unless it's not full.
This is just an example of when there is just one more rider than can fit on the bus, or in bitcoin terms, one more transaction than can fit in the next block. 
There are currently 10 mb worth of transactions in the mempool. Each block currently can hold 1 mb. That means even if no more transactions were made, the next 10 blocks would be full. Applying the bus analogy, there are 500 people waiting for each 50 person bus.
Those supporting bigger blocks want bigger busses. In our analogy, they want busses that can hold 100 people.
Those that want to keep blocks small suppose people will just pay more to get on sooner busses. 
Replace by fee is the mechanism that allows people about to get kicked off the bus to pay more to stay on. Before this was implemented, you could never get back on the same bus if you were kicked off because you didn't pay enough. 
Unfortunately most of the transactions in the mempool backlog were probably there before RBF was implemented.
The downside of RBF is that scammers can take advantage of people who don't pay attention and basically pay to take the bus to one destination but while they're on the way, get on another bus to somewhere else with the same fees they already paid. Basically getting two bus rides for the price of one. 
In bitcoin terms this means they could send the same coins to two places at once and one of the recipients who isn't paying attention to the fact that the transaction is with RBF and doesn't wait for confirmation will not actually receive any payment.
(Segregated witness and lightning network might be tough to explain with busses, but if anyone else wants to give it a shot, I'd be interested in reading it.)

Depends on platform and usage.
Storing large amounts for savings/hoarding/hodling purposes? Get a hardware wallet like Trezor or Ledger.
Need a day-to-day wallet that's safe and easy to use for Android that connects directly to the bitcoin network (and not through third party servers), get "Bitcoin Wallet" by Bitcoin Wallet Developers on the play store.
Need something for iOS? I don't have any apple devices, but I hear breadwallet is good.
For desktop (windows, mac, Linux)? Use bitcoin core or bitcoin classic.
Honorable mentions probably include mycelium (Android, supports hardware wallets), copay (Android, desktop, supports multisig), greenbits (Android, desktop, supports some hardware wallets, multisig, other features), airbitz (Android, has built in vendor directory/map), armory (desktop, may be out of date?, has advanced features), multibitHD (desktop, may be out of date?, has advanced features), electrum (desktop, Android, has advanced features).

This is interesting as a whole but I think the most surprising and possibly controversial conclusion is:


Peter Todd among others believe keeping a smaller block size in the lowest level of the block chain will maintain decentralization at a higher cost (aka drive fees higher). This presumes (I think) that people will pay more fees for their transactions to get them propagated faster by inclusion in blocks sooner. But if analysis shows higher fees don't move transactions any faster, then the "fee market" is a myth and the only way to move transactions faster is to have bigger blocks so more transactions move per block.
@_date: 2016-02-25 17:07:03
Unfortunately blocks are basically full. Not much you can do except try to send new transactions from the same inputs with higher fees.
@_date: 2016-02-17 20:53:05
That should work. Did you compile the earlier version with disable-wallet or did it ship like that? The only thing you'd need to preserve between the two versions is the data directory where the blockchain is stored (although, even that isn't required).
You should also check to see what enabling the wallet requires... I think a certain version of Berkley DB. But from the looks of your hypothetical commands it looks like you've taken that into account.
@_date: 2016-02-04 21:51:39

I've been doing approximately what you're describing. I use mycelium for my "spending" coins and paper wallets with strong passwords as my "storage". You can send to a paper wallet safely at any point. When you need some of the coins, you can sweep the whole paper wallet into mycelium, spend what you need, then send the remaining balance back to another paper wallet. I have about 9 paper wallets printed in the same sheet of paper, folded up, and held in my wallet.
If you use this method, you'll want to have a strong password for each wallet, copies of the paper wallets elsewhere (at home in a safe maybe?) And only send from each paper wallet one time.
Bitaddress.org is how I made my paper wallets. For maximum security, you should save a copy of the site offline, put it on a bootable CD, boot a computer off the CD while it's not connected to the internet, generate paper wallets and print on a printer that has no wireless option and is connected directly to the CD-booted computer. 
If you need to compromise a little, bootable usb and pdf is okay, but realise with each compromise from this method you sacrifice a small amount of security. For example, Pdf instead of direct print raises some risk that whatever you move the pdf to before printing could theoretically be compromised and your keys be broken if your password wasn't strong enough. Wireless internet connected printer means you don't know 100% for sure if what you printed isn't also being sent off to some other place. Usb instead of CD boot introduces issues with the possibility of a BadUSB exploit. 
Generally if you are careful you should be safe using this method though. The private keys are still held offline, but are introduced to internet connected devices when funds are taken out of the paper wallets. That's why you only want to use the paper wallets for withdrawal once.

This may help you decide. 
If you click on the 9 month view you can see the difficulty isn't going up exponentially anymore.
Antminer S5 can definitely still be profitable, but maybe not "get rich quick" level of profitable. You need to calculate how much it will cost to run. Then compare that to how much bitcoin you expect to make with it. Then compare btc/fiat conversion. Then make your own guesses as whether difficulty of mining or price of bitcoin in fiat will go up or not.
There are a lot of factors to consider.

No they don't. Bitcoin can be tracked easily back to where they came from. Mixers make this more difficult.
@_date: 2015-10-18 23:18:39
This seems to maybe fit the bill: 
Or if you have old hardware around you can set one up pretty easily.

If you have money or valuables stolen, you need to either get it back or call the police. Simple. Posting on reddit will not help.

No offense, but probably user error. Have never ever had a problem with mycelium
@_date: 2015-02-11 15:35:51
Not a mission. Just posting my experiences. Tell your cardiologist he can send my fee in bitcoins haha.
On a serious note though, even if others in this sub aren't just making stuff up, it isn't particularly fair for the bad press to be the only press. It's kinda like reviewing restaurants online. Unless you have a bad experience you're much less likely to write a review.
@_date: 2015-02-11 13:57:47
Exactly. PEBCAK or in this case, maybe PEBCAP/PEBCAM
@_date: 2015-02-11 15:31:50
No but they can certainly be compelled by law enforcement to disclose that. The question is then how much do you trust the exchange and it's employees and data security practices.
Edit: as mentioned elsewhere in this thread, coinbase, for example, actively analyzes transactions associated with its users and will black list you if there are things it doesn't like.

You can import private key or use the "cold storage" feature. I believe mycelium says the " cold storage" feature stores the keys temporarily in memory but not on permanent storage. Either way should be fine as long as you don't reuse the paper wallets as a safe place to hold your coins (reusing a former cold storage address as a hot wallet would be fine, but entirely unnecessary, in fact I can't think of a single reason to do so).
@_date: 2015-02-16 13:20:39
Exactly. You can charge back a credit card transaction up to 90 days after the purchase. In some cases even beyond that 90 days. Until you're beyond that period, the transaction is not irreversible.
Fraudsters use this to get out of paying their bill. Merchants need to prove the transaction was real and made by the cardholder to dispute a charge back. That's one reason why they hang on to receipts. I believe fraudulent chargebacks are more common online.
Double spending is also fraud. I'd wager its more complex to pull off and less likely to succeed than a fraudulent chargeback.

It's the biggest altcoin. Main features are faster blocks and a different algorithm. Many people regard all altcoins as scams.

The block chain explorer apis are something I can work with. Should be trivial to work those into a spreadsheet. Thanks.

Exchanges don't charge the fee. The person sending the bitcoin picks how much of a fee to add and the miners collect the fee. More fees = mined faster. 
@_date: 2015-02-08 14:16:40
Just solo mine and think of it like playing the lottery while supporting the bitcoin network. This is the easiest way to get started. 
@_date: 2015-02-11 13:22:42
Same here.

Hey this is an awesome explanation. Thanks for being transparent. Have a beer on me @_date: 2015-02-11 14:33:22
Does that mean there should never be?
I had several bicycles stolen from me while locked up when I was in college. One time it was on security camera. The cops weren't able to help. This is not an issue isolated to bitcoin.

Dems and repubs are both hypocritical. 
@_date: 2015-02-16 03:17:23
Haha yeah... Cold storage I meant...
Edit: had to edit this because it said cod storage at first haha

You literally just said being held up at gunpoint is bitcoin's fault.

0 confirms are fine for small amounts. Please don't spread FUD. Credit card transactions are also still not settled for up to 90 days anyway, which would be approximately 12,960 transactions.
