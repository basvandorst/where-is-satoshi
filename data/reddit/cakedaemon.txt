I received something similar from someone claiming to be the Bitcoin bull bear.
@_date: 2012-10-30 16:32:31
It's weird how these things kind of balance out. Computing power increases just as the value of hashes is set to diminish.
@_date: 2012-09-07 18:27:12
That reminds me of the Dothraki in 'A Game of Thrones'. Do you expect there may be a huge sell-off of bitcoins to transfer into a better, stronger, more precious electronic currency?
@_date: 2012-09-07 17:24:55
To me it seems that bitcoin is the .com of electronic currency. A lot of domain squatters benefited from its initial commodity value but pretty soon the field became diluted with all manner of domain names.
@_date: 2012-10-31 17:24:43
Wow, that is very interesting. 
@_date: 2012-10-30 12:25:58
So would this be a good thing to get? Could you actually turn a profit or do you think that the market being flooded with high power computing would have more of an inflationary effect?
@_date: 2012-09-07 18:26:04
I guess I meant it as a neutral phrase: bitcoin's fate is similar to .com in my mind.. it's a commodity based on similar exclusive appeal.
I was wondering if beyond the value of .com domain names whether bitcoin's mathematical nature made it more valuable in the broader sense. In contrast to .com domain names, there are only finite bitcoins for starters. But I wondered if the finite nature would be eroded by having other electronic currencies in the market.
@_date: 2012-09-10 10:52:59
I think it's the number of large incoming transactions with exactly identical outgoing
@_date: 2013-02-10 13:30:21
Yes. Actually the fact that bitcoin favours early adopters is the reason that it's survived this far and keeps going; For any point *t* in time the *reward:risk* ratio for joining is like a constant ratio, as the two are inversely proportional.
However bitcoin is one technology where so far risk seems to result in reward very consistently.
@_date: 2013-04-08 12:09:36
This was posted here as well: 
It looks like someone stole the coins and used a low-volume exchange to transfer them at a very low price.
@_date: 2013-04-08 19:42:23
Honestly, where do we go from here?
@_date: 2013-03-01 18:03:52
Fair enough, but actually this is for sending invoices. I should probably have mentioned that in my original comment.
Usually I send invoices and then they pay with Paypal. I'd like to say 'can you kindly pay by XXX' because I am no longer using PayPal.
@_date: 2013-04-08 13:59:35
I got your joke. I do however feel that after a very rapid growth period the graph will begin to resemble the generation function.
@_date: 2013-01-27 02:23:18
Now they're just burning a hole in my wallet. Looking at the satoshi dice page thinking.. I can do this. THen thinking.. I can build a damned satoshi dice site.
@_date: 2013-03-31 22:38:14
Wow, that's a pretty huge risk.
Are other clients more secure? For example Bitcoin-QT?
@_date: 2013-01-31 01:57:53
Fair enough, but there are only 21 million coins to go around. That means that each person on average will have 0.003 BTC. Some people are sitting on 50,000 already.
@_date: 2013-01-30 16:51:13
So.. I did place an order at slightly below the average.. and after a while it was taken into escrow! good times. 
Looking at the chart here:  you can see roughly where the distribution lies and place a bid that is strategically higher up in the queue based on its value. Currently a bid for $18.75 or so would be quite high in the queue but still below average.
@_date: 2013-04-03 21:35:09
Kind of.. I think that the mtgox situation shouldn't actually affect the ability of the network to perform transfers.
@_date: 2013-05-15 18:31:59
What happens if they go down for good? Would the bitcoins in one's account be lost forever???
@_date: 2013-01-26 22:44:03
Localbitcoins is what I used. Works like a charm. In Canada you can use cavirtex. Mt.gox is a bit of a pain in the ass because they make you jump through so many hoops to get signed up and actually make a transfer.
@_date: 2013-03-06 14:31:27
I doubt it would become a world currency. In my own humble understanding of economics, it seems more like a lubricant for global trade.. A 'transactional currency' as Falkvinge puts it in the link below.
@_date: 2013-02-01 17:42:26
Totally agree. I feel like we're at the second wave of the IPO right now and we've got a chance to get in somewhere near the ground floor. Still a great place to be. Can't think through any scenarios where bitcoins will just cease to exist.
@_date: 2013-04-01 02:15:34
If it goes to $20 I'll be so sad I can't buy more. But I'll buy more like a motherfucker.
@_date: 2013-01-31 03:40:00
Yes. Thank you for putting a name to it. I mean I see that bitcoins have a duality to them. They're absolutely valueless save for the price people are willing to pay for them. It reminds of primitive societies that used sea shells or rocks for currency that were only valuable as long as people assigned value to them.
At the same time it's a commodity in the sense that it's rare, hard to acquire and produce.. so it does have some kind of inherent value.
Apart from these factors, it's also very useful and it seems unlike any monetary system ever used before..
So it's easy to get hooked on bitcoins and that just keeps the cycle going.
@_date: 2013-03-11 04:28:39
I have worried that these alternative currencies will become inflationary and dilute the wealth of Bitcoins, but I think that no matter what, there will have to be an exchange possible between all of these.
That said, what is preventing every group of people from starting their own altcoin economy and just competing with everyone else?
@_date: 2013-01-31 13:02:26
Yes that's true, but it's not very democratic when some people hold multiple orders of magnitudes more than others. Half the bitcoins that will ever exist have been shared betwixt a handful of users. From now on, production is going to be slowing down and we're going to be fighting over the few bitcoins that are left.
Yes, the price of these will be going down, so like even though 25 bitcoins are being produced instead of 50 with every block, those 25 are now worth $20 instead of $5 so things are actually heating up and the reward is like 4x what it used to be.
That said, miners that got 50 coins are still enjoying the benefits too! and future miners are at a severe disadvantage, as will be poor folks that only find out about bitcoin in 2016.
@_date: 2013-01-30 13:37:51
Wow, That is a very informative and information-dense explanation. I have read it twice and will read it again shortly.
@_date: 2013-05-10 15:20:59
However, I would avoid paying taxes in actual bitcoins (if that's an option). Convert back to the government-issued currency.
@_date: 2013-02-26 18:29:27
There seems to be a slowing down of trading.
I'm pretty confident that if the price dips it will be a good opportunity to buy some more BTC.
Currently the above-$30 price is somewhat inflated due to sudden interest and some speculation. The biggest barrier right now is outlets other than gambling that accept BTC. As more BTC-friendly retailers and services that can convert BTC to mainstream commodities (like pizza or Amazon gift cards) come online the price will reach its cruising altitude.
As well, as global economies come online to BTC, the demand will continue to remain steady.

If I make any purchases with bitcoin, I immediately replace the funds for no net loss.
@_date: 2013-01-27 02:13:40
I'm almost done the registration at mt.gox and I had to send them so much information it isn't funny. After sending them a scan of my driver's license, internet bill they still need to verify my date of birth and country of birth, so that means I need to send them my passport too! And none of these things can be censored or edited in any way. Unbelievable. In canada at least, cavirtex is probably the best way to go.
@_date: 2013-04-05 15:30:05
What happened with the 0.8 Fork that happened the other day then? What if all the miners in BTC Guild agreed that blocks of 1000001 bytes were OK after all and just kept churning out hashes?
@_date: 2013-04-11 00:52:56
Woa! You were so right!
@_date: 2013-01-30 04:47:53
Sweet! I guess orders get filled by order of placement? hmm. looking at the chart  it looks like we're either experiencing a spike that'll mellow out again, or the whole world is awakening to bitcoins and people are buying them up faster than tickle me elmos.
@_date: 2013-04-08 14:03:06
The reason it's not a traditional bubble is that it's not currently able to be 'overvalued'. Not like Volkswagen in 2008 or the Hong Kong housing market. Since those things have intrinsic value (beyond the price people are willing to pay for them) they can be overvalued. Add to that the manipulation imposed on the financial sector by banks and governments and you've got a system that can very easily feedback and blow up on itself.
The same goes for bitcoin stocks.. Buying and holding (especially non-derivative paying stocks) is a bad strategy because the rise of bitcoin will eventually overvalue the stock and cause the stock price to fall!
@_date: 2013-05-03 14:24:06
THIS LOOKS FUCKING AWESOME!
@_date: 2013-04-05 11:24:49
Oh I see, the miners become slaves to the pool and it behaves like one giant miner? They could really fuck up the game in that case, couldn't they. *They* could become bitcoin. and we could be left out in the dark. This is real intrigue.
@_date: 2013-03-03 14:53:16
I see. This is a good start but it's not as convenient as paypal by any means. I think the main issue here is that there isn't (and can't be?) a direct conversion between credit card payments and bitcoins. That's going to be inconvenient.
@_date: 2013-03-31 23:31:46
Yes, all have mac versions as far as I know. So what's the point of using multibit??
@_date: 2013-03-04 16:46:31
We're in exactly the same situation. I too got in at 0.76 on Havelock.
Getting a bit antsy about the situation right now. Not sure how dividends will be distributed? I'm guessing you'll get like 0.02BTC/share if you're lucky.
@_date: 2013-03-31 23:29:56
Yes. That isn't really too extreme actually. Somewhat impractical, but definitely somewhat foolproof. You really wouldn't want all your bitcoins lying around unprotected, be they a few or a few hundred.
@_date: 2013-04-02 21:27:34
You're right. But the poor guy holding the gem can use all the help he can get.

I know how you must've felt. Oh I'm buying alright.
@_date: 2013-01-30 15:56:20
By the way, here is a similar chart for cavirtex: 
@_date: 2013-05-16 03:07:09
Yes, blockchain is usually pretty instantaneous too. The thing to remember is that the delays we experience are due to the services we are using. The bitcoin network is next to infallible when it comes to tracking transactions.
@_date: 2013-02-10 05:23:00
Yes, bitcoins have doubled in value from ~10 when I first looked at them beyond having just heard of the word 'bitcoin' to today.
My thinking is that if bitcoins are going to become a standard for web commerce and occupy even 10% (grossly underestimated value) of traffic, they will have to be worth thousands of dollars each given the number in circulation and the value of the money they will represent.
@_date: 2013-04-03 15:25:01
Haha, that's cool. I really appreciate your positive spin on this.
I just did the calculations, and after taking a bath on SDICE (on the same exchange).. I have only ever lost money when it comes to damned Satoshi Dice .. I am actually exactly even from when I started. Time to put the coins under the mattress though.
@_date: 2013-04-22 15:03:01
I'm going to say it's worthwhile as a learning experience but you'd need a very cheap source of electricity in order to actually turn a profit or even break even.
Assuming that the machines offer a similar power/cost ratio, it's very unlikely you'll be able to break even on the cost of the machine itself if you're at the tail of the queue, once difficulty increases to compensate for all the added power of all the people ahead of you in the line.
@_date: 2013-01-31 02:49:20
Interesting. But like you couldn't get an apple share now if you wanted it. But for bitcoin to be a universal currency, you'd need to be able to get some pretty easily.
@_date: 2013-04-01 02:16:42
He forgot gambling!
@_date: 2013-01-31 02:11:50
Yes, that's a great way of looking at it. But even with adjusting the zeros that means that some early adopters are already billionaires.
@_date: 2013-03-31 23:51:39
But like, apart from the threat of having my wallet file stolen off my computer, is there any risk of my coins being stolen via the bitcoin network somehow?.. using Multibit or Bitcoin-QT or another bitcoin client?

I trade on cavirtex. All things considered, it's way better. Granted the fees are higher, but it's not bad if you do volume. And there's no bullshit having to send money into and out of japan. I even had money *in* japan that I had to transfer manually out of the country and back into Cavirtex because MtGox couldn't get their shit together and help me do an internal bank transfer within the same damned country. Isn't that the whole point of bitcoins? Not having to send money through banks??
@_date: 2013-04-03 15:16:38
Yes, that is true.. They are protected.. but like I bought in at $30 during the IPO. Currently the stock price is at like 60 which would normally be amazing.. but at the same time my actual bitcoins are down.
@_date: 2013-04-02 12:53:23
Yes, I know. I guess what I was trying to encapsulate is that a fool and his coins are soon parted. Everybody knows *now* that Pirate was not legit.. but a lot of people fell for it at the time!.
What I want to know is that this forecasting service seems legit but it also costs 1.79BTC/month.. so wondering if anyone has experience with it and how much capital you really need to take advantage of it!
@_date: 2013-03-11 04:09:20
Nevermind the trolls. You've just raised the price of bitcoin to $250. Thank you.
@_date: 2013-03-11 20:18:20


If I understand correctly, that's because ASIC's will now be so much more efficient than general purpose hardware. However, there could still be a 51% attack based on a huge number of ASIC's (in theory?)

@_date: 2013-01-31 15:06:08
I meant like they still got their coins, and those coins continue to appreciate long after they are mined. The miner that sells coins right after they're discovered is the one that loses out. Otherwise long-term miners that started out in the beginning and held onto their coins are now laughing because they got double the coins if that makes any sense?
In other words: mining is a money-losing proposition in the short  to mid term, but in the end the proceeds begin to inflate in value and appreciate greatly over time.
@_date: 2013-04-08 17:34:23
@_date: 2013-04-02 12:51:45

It seems if someone did try to do that, the price would skyrocket to the point that the *couldn't* keep at it for too long.
@_date: 2013-01-27 02:11:40
I too got into them because of SR. But I soon abandoned that avenue for spending and decided that building up a collection of bitcoins is much better.
@_date: 2013-01-23 23:06:01
But how does this damned thing work?
@_date: 2013-03-20 14:40:00
My first thought is : "fucking heediots" but my second thought is: The power of bitcoin is not who holds it, but who accepts it. If the local kiosk and taverna accepted bitcoin, suddenly there would be a reason to use it.
@_date: 2013-01-31 01:56:01
I hear you there.. but actually the second point is exactly how .com squatters operate. Look up Frank Schilling to see how he increases the value of his whole portfolio by never selling anybody domains like 'toon.com' or 'nigerianscholarships.com' :  and has relegated the whole world to using .info names.
If bitcoin is the .com of the virtual currency world, what happens when .org, .net, .biz and .coin open up?
@_date: 2013-01-31 02:50:29
That sounds cool. But if the king of Saud wanted to buy like 2000000 bitcoins right now, he could get them for a bargain and drive prices up at the same time, no?
@_date: 2013-04-03 02:27:29
Thanks for your reply! I just got off the chat to no avail. Maybe a support ticket is a better option.
@_date: 2013-03-06 15:10:24
I think we're also at the takeoff stage, but it's disappointing to think that a couple of weeks ago you could get 10 BTC for $200 and now you can't get 5.
At the same time, that's what's making them valuable.. So it's to be expected. I wish I had a few thousand though. Not just double digits...
@_date: 2013-04-03 15:16:52
There's probably a boundary where it's better to sell at a loss.
@_date: 2013-03-02 06:03:13
Yes you're right.
It's actually a selfish move because I hate losing like 6% to PayPal and another 3% if I should buy bitcoins from an exchange.. so I skip the middleman. Plus it takes 9 days to transfer funds from PayPal into a bank account.
Did I mention I'm in Canada??
@_date: 2013-04-05 11:19:54
Dudes, I may be out of line here, but isn't bitcoin more democratic than that?
In other words: you can do whatever you want, mine in BTC Guild if you want. Even if they control 75% of the network, they don't control 100% of the miners within the pool!
As one commenter below noted: this could facilitate a hard fork to increase the block size, something seen by a lot of people as a good thing.
Again, not sure if I'm speaking out of my ass, but I think bitcoin is decentralized to a fault. and that also means we can't get up in arms if some pool controls more than 50% of the mining.
@_date: 2013-04-03 15:47:08
This is awesome advice. The best securities I can think of right now are mining funds.

There's nothing stopping you from paying or exchanging bitcoins outside of any exchange. That's the damned beauty of bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-03-04 05:27:04
Never understood why asic companies would bother selling these things. If they can pay themselves off in mere days they would have all the incentive in the world to just use them and take over the whole network for either good or evil.

Once you get to  , open your network console and look at the network traffic as you hit 'confirm'. If it's black, it'll say pending for a while.. if it's red it'll be a 502.

Hey, in contrast to you, I learned about bitcoins more than a year ago when they were at $8 and sat on my hands for more than a year with the cavirtex paper signed on my desk before I decided to finally scan it and send it in! (to sign up for the canadian exchange)
@_date: 2013-02-21 18:34:04

What client are you using? I use multibit and it shows up pretty soon, but can't be spent until a couple of confirmations have passed.
@_date: 2013-05-05 02:07:32
There's also 1,000,000 bitcoins that belong to like 'satoshi' that were mined from the genesis block.. and there's another wallet with 111,111 bitcoins in it, so the number is actually a bit lower. And we're jerking each other off with both hands at this point.. in answer to

@_date: 2013-02-01 17:40:36
This actually echoes some of my own thoughts. Because BTC is infinitely divisible (assuming perfect floating point math?) you could find a situation where $100 = 0.000001 BTC (just for the sake of illustration).
But even so, that doesn't change the fact that hoarding is advantageous to increasing the prices.
@_date: 2013-01-31 03:01:09
Wow you really do make a great case.

You know what? I was actually originally into bitcoins exactly for the purpose of ordering some such oddments from our friends on SR.. but then getting bitcoins became a quest in and of itself! It took me all summer to figure out what to do. I watched bitcoins appreciate in value from $10 to $18 in a matter of months!
