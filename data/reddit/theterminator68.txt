I would argue that many of the currencies out there have some sort of centralization to then due to Asics and mining farms.  DPOS at least gives the opportunity to disperse some of the centralization to other nodes.

I am of the mindset that in the long long run we might not even see the top coins out yet, but their subreddit is just a circle jerk, no discussion of any tech.

Like what?  I have a foot in both camps as I think it is hard to determine which tech is going to win out, but I want to know everything about all the tech at play here.  Haven't personally been able to find anything negative outside of someone getting a large majority of the currency to control it, but either way if they have a large majority in both situations they have the same amount of control.

I mean we all know bitcoin cash won't be the next big thing, how will they scale beyond making bigger blocks?

I cashed out 70 dollars to an OKpay account 4 days ago and I still have not received the funds.  I contacted their customer support and they keep ignoring me and answering with 1 word replies and then ignoring my responses.
I am done dealing with them once they give me my 70 dollars, the customer support is horrible and they owe me money.

Leave enough money to make a decent tip too.  This should just be a little extra.
