An off grid system will cost MORE than the power it generates is worth in most of the US.

An off grid system requires a charge controller, batteries and an inverter.   You lose efficiency with the charge controller, as well as the inverter and the batteries ; well you lose a lot of efficiency there. 
Now compared that to a grid tie system of say SolarEdge which is one of the most efficient systems available with an overall efficiency of 98% tied to the grid which is 100% efficient (way more than a battery)....  
Then you have to plan on replacing the batteries since off grid you are cycling at least once a day.   Not all days are full sun so you have a lose in production on many days. leading to under charged batteries.   




It is somewhat comical that you think Sweden is going to have 6 solar Sun hours per day, every day, year round.  6 would be the best day in June, ~0.75 h would be average day in December.   And that is IF there are no shadows.
You might want to check out a basic irradiance table:  


Well first year degradation is 1% and average of 0.5% there after for general PV modules.  
The PV modules are warrantied for 25 years with some total degradation at the end.


Now I am one to believe in things continuing after warranty but you are expecting flawless production for 50 years??
That would of course just be for the PV modules, off grid batteries are NOT going to last past 10 years at very best and that would be for expensive batteries.  Inverters and charge controllers are very unlikely to make it 25 years off grid, much less double that.  Off grid inverters have a shorter life expectancy than grid tie.

What system are you talking about?
SolarEdge has built in production monitoring.  You have to add on consumption monitoring though.

Did you get the SolarEdge consumption monitor with the system?   
SolarEdge has terrific produciton monitoring and it can be easily exported to PVOutput.ORG, can you share a link to the monitoring?

As I stated the inverter itself has excelent built in production monitoring.   To monitor other things you would need to add on a meter (and yes they will connect to the modbus).  You can add on a revenu grade production meter, consumption meter, for export limitation, etc.  
Which add on meter are you adding?   The meters BTW are Wattnode brand

OP has SolarEdge with optimizers.  These have an off switch and cut down to safe DC levels via rapid shutdown

The battery also has an expected life in a daily cycling of 10 years
ROI of 40 years, expected life of 10 years means no Return on Investment.

Actually you are confusing the toxicity of thin film solar with crystalline  based.    Thin film is highly toxic.   
Crystalline is not.

Hours of sunlight is NOT the same as sun Hours, used as a rule of thumb for solar production.   Your production estimates are grossly exaggerated.  


No they are not, click the button and you can see tilted at different tilts as well as continues variable through the year.
