I bet out of everyone in that video only the asian guy would even come close to figuring out how to make a purchase.  They make it sound like anyone with a computer can just wander over to SR and buy some drugs.  The difficulty of SR/bitcoins keeps the scrubs out.

Seems like a pretty effective method for buying without having to go through an exchange site.  
Too bad only one seller within 100 miles of me

I am very afraid to buy right now.  But I want to so badly!

I do expect bitcoins to rise in value, but it won't be anything like the $30 boom in June.  I'm talking like post 2020.  And that that point I think it will have lost much of its initial hype.

Your best bet for bitcoins if you want to spend money from your paypal would be to buy a monepak card.  You can buy these re-loadable cards at 7-11's, CVS, and some other stores.  Then you load that card with money from your paypal.  Then you can use your moneypak to either directly buy from another user safely, or some exchange sites actually accept moneypak.

With the ways things are going, a change like this could revitalize the bitcoin.  
Amazon wouldn't want anything to do with bitcoin though.  However, it's still worth a try.  
I live for the day where I can see bitcoins hit $30 again.

At about 25% more per coin, not worth it at all.  Although you are paying for the fancy looking coin.  Would be cool to just have one.

When I watched it the first time, I expected it to rocket back up.  Nope.avi.  I actually just started mining because of how low the value is.  Here's to hoping it goes back up.

Hardly.  More like 20 for an extremely high quality gram.  Minus whatever you saved from buying BTC when it was at lower value.
