This is my first web application, so be gentle on the layouts! I’m new to css and html! 
@_date: 2018-01-19 15:57:32
Yup. Just delete gbp and put whatever in there. There wasn’t an enumerated list available on their site, but most seem to work. 
@_date: 2019-08-25 16:31:14
I did. I have/had AVS which somewhat stopped it. I'm not sure if it covers day zero ones, though.

I did contact them prior to making the post, to hopefully find where my vulnerabilities lie. I did actually see they integrate it when I was looking to see how to create a new wallet with them, and see if there were any (fools attempt) ways in which I could retrieve my coins somehow.
@_date: 2019-08-25 07:29:20
I agree. A few of my old buddies kept all of their coins on online exchanges and never traded them out, and I thought they were crazy! Ironically, all the exchanges I use, I have 2FA, and it probably would've been safer in this instance!
@_date: 2019-08-25 07:32:28
Completely agree. This wasn't a post to discourage the use of bitcoin. It was to discourage being a goddamn idiot (like yours truly).
@_date: 2019-08-25 14:26:04
There weren't any errors. It was just the standard update message. 
I was unlucky, but I also made silly choices that could have otherwise prevented me from losing them. Like others have said, a hardware wallet, or cold storage would have been very appropriate.

Heya, I've still not had any reply back from Exodus. Would you be able to give them a jolt? Thanks!
@_date: 2019-08-25 07:26:47
I have. I emailed them just prior to writing this post, actually. I largely wanted to see if my recovery phrase was used elsewhere, or if it were on my PC.
@_date: 2019-08-26 07:40:39
I wouldn't know, I'm afraid.
@_date: 2019-08-25 14:23:28
Because I'm a blithering idiot! Honestly? Laziness/complacency.
@_date: 2019-08-25 16:26:42
Apologies. I've changed it. I'm a sucker for a leading decimal place. My god, if it was 32, I think I would have been suicidal, and crazy not to be safer with it. Whilst 0.32 is still crazy money for me, 32 is beyond what I'd likely ever have in today's fiat!

I use Authy on my phone for 2FA, so it might not been as bad. I believe to disable 2FA, you have to use 2FA.
@_date: 2019-08-25 08:07:39
Potentially? I updated Exodus a couple days prior to losing the funds. The update is presented via the application.
@_date: 2019-08-25 08:00:38
Dang, that sucks. I didn't even realise until I was looking for something, and came across a "HOW TO DECRYPT FILES.txt" in some directories that got hit earlier. 
Yup. As the reality sunk in yesterday, I thought if I'd been an idiot with my money in my bank, at least I'm protected by the FSA/FSCS.
@_date: 2019-08-25 16:23:20
Thanks bud. I've got a roof over my head, and it was "just" savings to buy a place, so it'll take a while longer. Luckily, I didn't need it for any emergencies.
@_date: 2019-08-25 14:22:34
Thanks! It's much appreciated!
@_date: 2019-08-25 16:28:22
If anything, I'd expect them to be way harsher if I'd been that callous with THAT much money. That's retire-and-not-work-again kinda cash!
@_date: 2019-08-24 22:06:07
I honestly don't know if I can. It just hurt too much. When the Ledger came out, I thought it may be worth it, but shrugged it off thinking I'd never have an issue, since I was taking most precautions! Hindsight makes me sound a damned idiot, since they were only around 60 quid!
@_date: 2019-08-25 08:00:52
I did -_-.
@_date: 2019-08-25 16:39:04
Hah. For research papers, you'd get crucified for writing a leading zero, so it's out of habit, now! Hopefully! In the long term, it won't be much. Another 7-8 months of relatively aggressive saving, but do-able.
@_date: 2019-08-25 14:22:58
That's a pretty good analogy. I'd refuse to drive if someone didn't put on their seatbelt in my car!
@_date: 2019-08-25 08:04:32
Thank you :)! I'm not sure I have the stomach to deal with it again, though. Even though I know the steps to secure my funds, there doesn't seem to be a benefit for me otherwise.
@_date: 2019-08-26 07:41:56
Hah! This is definitely the year of worst things happening directly to me! The hit and run wasn't even too bad! An hour in A&amp;E and a few stitches!
@_date: 2019-08-25 08:10:28
I guess, but I have about 1 ltc, and that's it. I've moved it to a cold wallet generated elsewhere, so I've got nothing else worth taking on my laptop. 
I did. It really was a decent wallet, but the security is probably just a bit too limiting by itself.
@_date: 2019-09-05 08:41:02
I just checked, and it's definitely the correct email. I didn't get a bounceback. I'll try email again now, and see if I have any luck.
