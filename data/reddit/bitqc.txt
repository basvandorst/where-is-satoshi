Finally, I have high hopes for the Bitcoin protocol, not only because I can make a profit out of it, but because it's a smarter way to exchange and protect your wealth. It is also fundamentally different from what we are used to because it is not based on credit like the actual system is.
It makes you wonder, why your money is always loosing value or loosing buying power over time... It took me a while to get that, but now I know...

Bottom line is Bitcoin price is not absolutely linked to exchanges. Even if all the exchange would go away, you could always sell bitcoin for cash on the street and maybe make more money out of it...

Also, nothing prevents old fashion solo mining from resurfacing if it all goes to shit. A lot of things are taken for granted, but they should not. Bitcoin could loose a lot of value, but it would only loose the possibility to become a great tool to create a vast amount of new wealth in our dying financial system. It will always be there for use by the outcast in the worst case scenario which is also good for the one who do. For the first and better option, smart regulation is needed, the other outcome would most likely be the result of the opposite actions according to regulation.

That being said Bitcoin is a free market and if the big guys want the price to go down, it will go down... AS LONG AS THERE ARE SHEEP'S TO BE LEED ALONG THE WAY TO THE SLAUTHER HOUSE...

I was hold on by Reddit... A good one for fee speech... Had to wait  8 minutes for that one...
@_date: 2014-10-06 01:50:18
It does and like I stated, they are so desperate now that they don't even care...
@_date: 2014-10-06 03:12:29
It is all about the people
@_date: 2014-10-06 02:11:01
It does, do you think a bitcoin is worth 300$
@_date: 2014-10-06 02:58:02
I am about to go to sleep, but the world never does. I don't know who pays thoughtcrimeX, but is it surely the one manipulating the bitcoin market for the last few months. BEWARE, noting is at it seems...  
@_date: 2014-10-05 22:32:56
My educated guess is these coins belongs to big guys and they know exactly what they're doing. Bringing the price as low as they possibly can before their ETF comes in and buy all the cheap coins, the last time they will ever be cheap... The only question is, how low will this be?

You are right in some respect about that Qewbicle but 28k btc is not enough to make btc = 0$. I believe nothing is but the simple fact nobody would be using it anymore...
The order book is not static and changes with dynamics playing out. Now, there is a lot of activities which is good, the btc market as been dead for quite some time. The beautiful thing about this market is there are a lot of experienced players watching and intervening when the time is right. Otherwise, it would have been dead a long time ago. Bitcoin has been under the radar since 2011 and most probably before that when it was much more vulnerable.
Let's look at it in another perspective, if the price goes down to 10$ per Bitcoin, all the vc investments are whipped out. Regulators don't bother anymore and the Bitcoin protocol lives on to grow again. A possible outcome that would be short lived because the technology would be quickly picked up by other organizations to facilitate transactions with higher velocity and security than the actual financial system does.
The right thing is for authority to actually embrace Bitcoin before it evolves into an uncontrollable systems and swallow inflation at the same time. It's like killing two birds with the same stone... The only problem is, the big guys didn't see it coming and now they want their fair share of the pie, which seems to be too expensive right now

That being said Bitcoin is a free market and if the big guys want the price to go down, it will go down... To some extent, the price should not matter for now if your are not in for the $. If you are, follow the big players if you can and/or hold and learn to live with your gains and looses...

That big wall is up again @ 300, let's eat up this guy collectively and see what remains when we're done...
@_date: 2014-10-06 01:26:38
They are getting despaired @ lowering down the price now, they do it in plain sight (that typo was almost real)
@_date: 2014-10-06 03:45:20
wtf, you need to sell because you are scared, hold and pay your taxes, Be a good father when you sell, when ever you decide and when to sell... should we add reddbullish to the list of annoyance to our freedom?

A new and more accurate price discovery would evolve from the process and make it less prone to manipulation as it would be much more decentralized as it is right now.

A reply from not too long ago that needs reinforcement

Pretty impressive seeing people eat into the wall.
Keep on going and they will flee with their tail behind their legs...
@_date: 2014-10-06 02:36:03
This is just like adding an insult to an undeserved position, do you wonder why the market is not moving in your favor? 
@_date: 2014-10-06 01:25:04
Vires in numeris
@_date: 2014-10-06 01:49:05
I did reply to that, do you need any further explanation?
@_date: 2014-10-06 02:38:37
seems stable now, in the flash of an instant, like it should be will all the good news of the last few months
@_date: 2014-10-06 01:44:17
No need, in time, they will walk up to me... A little patience is all that is needed
@_date: 2014-10-06 03:36:49
what seems unachievable to one is easy to many, keep on trying, the bully will notice and fully understand your determination 
@_date: 2014-10-06 01:47:47
In the end, we are the one supporting it right, or best bet is maybe to sell everything, let it die with the millions in vc investments and start our own,
The code is free for everyone to use as long as you trust it...

A wall is a very big buy or sells order emitted on a given exchange that prevents further price increase or decrease by it's volume or size. Let's say I place an order for 30k Bitcoin @ a given price, it would take a lot of buyer or seller to get by that order and stop an upward or downward trend. 
@_date: 2014-10-06 03:55:29
if you need to, then sell. It is a free market after all. I am only exposing the bigger scheme of things. One should do as it feels right for themselves.

Count me in, these bastards are offering a Neptune or 3 btc for a Titan... Was your order also lost in their system?
@_date: 2015-04-04 04:27:02
I am a business customer, but still they kept on shipping to my personal name, I meet Brock Pierce @ BTC Miami in  January 2014 and he told me I would be very pleased with the delivery dates for the Neptune... This guy is a scumbag so as all the others @ KNC
This is a joke and these guys are in need of a lesson, I denied their offer and will be pursuing legal actions. 
@_date: 2015-04-04 04:35:20
They want to keep the unit for them self and screw up the people that helped them starting up. I placed order 256 for a Jupiter and even this one was not a good deal, I would have been better of buying btc than this machine, but still everything is not about money...
I was satisfied with the Jupiter, I have two Neptunes that were delivered late for a big price tag, I was expecting the  bonus Titan and got screwed big time. How can they offer 750$ for a machine that is well worth 3-4K? They just figure out they're better of to mine with the Titan and fuck everybody up... Bastards, I am about to fly there and square things away ;-)
