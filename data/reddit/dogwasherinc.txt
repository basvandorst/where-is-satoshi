Everyone can change the code but the majority of users have to agree on it for it to have effect. Even you can change whatever you want. You'll just gonna need to convince everyone to switch to your code. 
There are a few people "in charge" though who work on the protocol but hardly anything is done in reality. Every new update is minimal. This is also a problem. Millions and millions are invested in Bitcoin companies but the Bitcoin core and client itself is still as primitive as it was 6 years ago. At this rate we can expect a usuable product that is good enough to go mainstream in 30 years from now or so. 
I have no idea why this is the case. I guess this is the side effect of being decentralized. There is no boss telling his employees what to do.

Because everyone should have a 1 year old account or something? How does that work in your world exactly?
@_date: 2015-02-01 22:19:11
No, you're not grounded and sane. But ironically your mental illness prevents you from realizing this. 
I bet many people already told you this, as you mentioned in your OP. I don't have people telling me this all the time. But if other people would tell me this all the time i would at one point take the hint.

No, you don't have to trust everyone instantly. That's why you ask for proof if needed. As was done here. But using someone's sign up date on Reddit is just retarded and means nothing. As you just found out. But you clearly have an teenage arrogance problem so you will just attack me instead of admitting it's idiotic. Don't bother replying, i won't read it. Go ahead on the downvotes though. Because that's what kids like you do when they can't win an argument.

This chart has been posted 100+ times at every possible price level and always with the text "we're here" at a random point. I've seen it posted twice in the same day with a different "we're here". 
Please stop posting it. 
@_date: 2015-02-02 11:05:27
No, it's not likely you will make 100k in 5 years. Stop spreading bullshit trying to get new people to buy coins so yours will become worth more. 
@_date: 2015-02-01 20:58:02
Do you realize that you suffer from several mental illnesses? Narcissistic personality disorder clearly being one of them. You're full of yourself. 
You really aren't that special, believe me. 
@_date: 2015-02-01 22:34:11
And this logic is based on what exactly?
@_date: 2015-02-01 19:11:19
What Cyprus effect? The ridiculous myth that people there moved to Bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-02-01 20:43:28
Take your meds. 
@_date: 2015-02-01 18:51:18
And still downvoted haha. This place...
@_date: 2015-02-01 15:52:56
It can only handle a few transactions per second. Now imagine a million people doing their daily transactions through Bitcoin. People here will tell you this will be no problem in the future but it will be. Bitcoin wasn't made to go mainstream. It simply can't. It wouldn't even be able to support one city. Just one! One dev is currently working on increasing the transaction limit. This is quite a big deal they say. Well, IF this gets done it still wouldn't be able to support 1 city moving to Bitcoin fully.
At this point there is no real solution for this problem. It would simply require a whole new system. But no matter what they won't call it a problem. Just a small non important inconvenience we won't need to discuss. At best they'll just throw in some buzzwords like "sidechains". 
@_date: 2015-02-01 22:54:09
Not 1 person has any idea what you're talking about. Your post is heavily downvoted. What is more likely? That we are all wrong and dumb or that you have certain issues?
Get help. I wish you the best. It's 2015. There is a lot they can do nowadays. Good luck. 
@_date: 2015-02-02 01:12:10
Hilarious. 
@_date: 2015-02-01 17:13:09
And this has what to do with Bitcoin?
Yes, just keep downvoting me. But no answer still. Maybe one of you downvoters can answer me?
@_date: 2015-02-01 22:12:20
And again...nothing. 
Do us and yourself a favor and step away from the computer. 
@_date: 2015-02-01 22:08:15
You know what. Just stop using banks and go full Bitcoin. Let me know how it works out. 
@_date: 2015-02-01 17:35:04
"There was smoke, and now we have found the fire," Wulkan said, revealing that a bitcoin address associated with Abu-Mustafa's group had already received around five bitcoins ($1,150, £760) through fundraising.
Compared to millions of dollars going to terrorism.

People aren't dismissive to the topic. It's just that nobody understands the topic. All you type is nonsense and nobody has an idea what you want or what you are saying. 
You're mentally ill. Your writings are that of a mentally ill person. It may seem normal to you but it isn't. 
And once again you're not special. Stop acting like you are. 
Go get professional help. You need it. 
@_date: 2015-02-01 23:08:46
He's 100% right. 
@_date: 2015-02-01 18:18:52
I read exactly the same thing 12 months ago. We've dropped 80% since. 
@_date: 2015-02-02 10:31:36
Actually 99% of the people here are in it for the price. It's just that when we're down like the last few months everyone will act like the price doesn't matter. I don't think i have to explain you why. 
Just wait till we go up 30 bucks and the whole page is filled with moon posts. Then it's all about the price again. 
@_date: 2015-02-01 17:25:02
Just like everything else it has it flaws. This is just not the right place to find out about them. 
And don't get me wrong, i love Bitcoin but i prefer to face reality unlike many here. And reality is it is nowhere near being able to go mainstream. 
@_date: 2015-02-01 22:44:09
And again nothing but madman ramblings. Just stop man. 
You want us to answer you but you can't even tell us what to answer to. You're mentally ill. I'm pretty sure most here will agree with me. And i'm sure everyone wishes the best for you. Which at this point is to stop posting crazy stuff on the internet and get professional help. 
Just try it. Your quality of life will greatly improve.  
@_date: 2015-02-01 18:02:48
Trolls: people who don't agree with me or are critical of Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-02-02 00:57:25
Yeah, i guessed something like that.
