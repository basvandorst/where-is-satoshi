Both a bitcoin bearer bond and a piggy bank and any other purpose you can make it serve. I've got three that I intend to use as a convenient means of transacting a dowry. It's a brave new world!

This is fantastic! The perfect Christmas gift. To the moon!

To the moon!

Solid deal, just bought 24.  I've found all sorts of unexpected uses for opendime.  Recently, i transacted a dowry with three of them.  Killer. Thanks guys.

You made four people very happy! You are a good person. I salute you.

Not so! I think maybe you don't what you're talking about? Shill for coinbase? 
I just bought some goats by handing an opendime stick to the seller.  Now that is efficient transacting! No fees! No trace! The goats are well, the seller is satisfied, and I'm dealing dealing ever dealing.  To the moon!

It's an opendime btc Xmas!
Yes, opendime makes a terrific Xmas present. My wife and quasi-wives have never been happier. Thank you opendime. Peace and love and to the moon!

I use it for transacting!
@_date: 2016-12-29 19:27:16
I think maybe you are jealous of my success? Maybe all the opendimes have sold out and you feel lost? 
Don't worry, i'm a lover not a fighter on a journey to the moon!

A dowry is essentially as u/bitcoinistanrising described it, except not quite so, well, vulgar.  See 
Three loaded opendime btc sticks and the wedding was a go!  It's a brave new world.

When I transact with fiat, the recipient also has to trust device functionality and authenticity, and i have to be sure not to lose it as there is no backup. 
With opendime, my transactions are free from tax and scrutiny.  I transact in many and varied ways! It's a brave new world.  I have no time for the haters.

This is really exciting.  Toxic maximalism embodied!
@_date: 2017-04-05 16:29:40
I agree! I transacted a dowry with opendime. Such a pleasure.

Dude! It is the bkockchain.

I value Rodolfo's opinion, not least because of his awesome beard. Men of btc calender anyone?

I received my wife's dowry via opendime.  It's a brave new world.
@_date: 2017-05-04 20:44:04
Why do you say that???
@_date: 2017-05-04 16:28:04
I'm going to propose to my wife! Will I give her a diamond ring? Please. This is r/bitcoin. I'll give her an opendime. Blockchain marriage! To the moon! 
@_date: 2016-07-08 01:27:46
Again, I disagree. All you want is attention Mr. coinkite.
@_date: 2016-07-21 20:16:17
My marriage was written to the block chain  with the help of u/rnvk. Maybe contact him? He's also an ordained minister of the life church should that assist.
@_date: 2016-07-08 01:25:51
I strongly disagree. You speak with a forked tongue.
@_date: 2018-12-03 13:20:33
Woah! That is a thing of beauty. How can I get one? I feel like I can ride it straight to the moon!
