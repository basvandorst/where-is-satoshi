Since they want to use the bitcoin to back a BTC ETF the underlying assets need to be insured. 
It's not "your own sense of feeling secure" that needs to be satisfied. You need to convince the insurance underwriter that your storage scheme is bulletproof enough to insure.
If you don't "bring in more people" you end up with a situation where one or two high level officials can conspire to steal all the funds. Insurance companies would be far more comfortable with a 7/10 key scheme where each Winkelvii holds 2 keys (four total), five keys held by five different law firms and 1 key held by the insurance company itself.
This prevents any ability for the twins to steal their own coins from the ETF since they'd need 3/5 legal firms in the on grab to get to 7 signatures-- it also gives a built in conflict resolution mechanism. If there is disagreement between the twins themselves this allows the law firms and insurance company to help play arbiteur between parties, and as always the 6 keys not controlled by the twins aren't enough to rob them blind.
That covers your major internal threats, since nobody can override anyone without a check or balance to their power. 
For external security: Good luck stealing or rubber hosing all 4 of the keys out of the twins and 3 of 5 top flight law firms-- all of whom likely hired private security to watch over the storage and decryption keys for their asset. Oh also, you have to successfully grab all the keys before any of the parties can communicate with each other. 
Your scheme is secure, for you.  My scheme is INSURABLE.

Rubber hose crypto.

Until someone beats you with a rubber hose until you give up the safe combo. 
Secure storage scheme rejected by insurance underwriter.

They settled for $65M, I'd be amazed if the went home with more than 35% of that, which then needs to be split 2 ways (or 3? they had a third plaintiff IIRC).
It would have been an incredibly expensive lawsuit, the firm working it would have easily been able to bill hourly the whole way and still take a percentage cut of the settlement.

Very carefully with several high priced information security firm advising and auditing your systems. 
Rule  would be never talking about the specifics of it unless absolutely necessary, and certainly never in public.
IF I had to speculate I would guess a complex multi-sig arrangement with all the keys stored in some physically air gapped way by multiple law firms and trustees. Also you'd want a very robust audit log on all the private keys. 
I doubt very much they'd be willing to trust a ~$100 hardware widget to secure that much wealth.

Only other poster in the thread that can present a storage scheme that would pass muster with the actuaries.

Why? and how? From what I'm seeing he was released after 13 days and was never prosecuted??
My only guesses at this point are that he was an asset for FBI or CIA

They never even charged him though! Typically they charge you, and then you reduce the exposure to those charges through cooperation. 
And even if he could have delivered every single vendor and user of the site down to a man, they'd never let him walk scott free. It'd be 5 years and maybe a favorable bond review after 18 months gets him out. 
It's strange that SDNY gave Ross the whole show but let Blake off with just a little reputational damage

To be entirely fair, controlling the private keys wouldn't actually help him cash the money out at this point. Getting ID verification done with other exchanges takes time.

Looks like their Paypal account already got pulled.

Hdds fail, paper is fragile in its own way. Security, ease of use and longevity will always be at odds.

$10 to send $10,000, internationally in an hour?  Do you have any idea what paypal or western union would charge? 
$10 on $10,000 is one fifth of the lowest possible fee you would pay to wire that amount internationally.

How do you feel knowing that given the first degree relationship between the two of you, an FBI agent has likely taken a fine tooth comb to your entire online persona?

If people disclose their full business plan in public and someone else executes it better than they are or can execute shouldn't that be considered  not only a legitimate business venture but just as much of a win for bitcoin as a whole anyway? 
If dishonest investors or principles are your worry; contracts, payment structures, and escrow will help protect both parties, just like in the larger USD economy.

If that much BTC had been bought up on the exchanges, what would the price be at right now? 250? more?

To be fair, that gigantic government organization with the power to "screw the rules' is also the only organization with a solid track record of designing and implementing crypto systems with as much complexity and nuance as the Bitcoin protocol.
