Just use BIP38 and save yourself the money if it is for cold storage.
@_date: 2016-01-15 03:33:43
all day?  Really?
@_date: 2016-01-13 03:46:03
Choosing to subject yourself to the conditions of the majority in order to have a more realistic view on the actual state of something is a bad thing?  I personally appreciate his perspective.
@_date: 2016-01-13 03:26:04
Yes, we have one right now and that is the software we run, but what is playing out now is a struggle for what mechanism we adopt as a community and what channels we choose to trust for communication.  This is natural and as it should be and it gives me some faith.
@_date: 2016-01-13 02:44:11
We're not just choosing new code, make no mistake about it, we are agreeing on a structure for consensus and that will most certainly affect power in the future. This is a bigger decision than anything we do with the code going forward.
@_date: 2016-01-07 02:10:22
And bitcoin won't either.
@_date: 2016-01-15 02:46:52
Why does that matter?  As best I can tell, Hearn is not Blockstream nor do their proposals conflict with each other.
  
Do you see a conflict or can you describe how your comparison is relevant?
@_date: 2016-01-12 02:15:39
Then just make multiple wallets.  You're literally throwing money away for something you don't need.  How much will the cost of that device be worth in bitcoin ten years from now?  Don't forget why you're looking at cold storage solutions in the first place.
  
You can email yourself the BIP38 wallets and redeem them anywhere in the world while a hardware wallet can be taken or lost and backing up the wallet introduces its own new set of considerations.
@_date: 2016-01-15 02:40:56
How many people is that?
@_date: 2016-01-12 02:34:40
My pleasure.  I got into bitcoin when there were no hardware wallets so BIP38 is a solution I am used to and I am open to the idea I am turning into a *fuddy duddy*. ;)
@_date: 2016-01-13 03:52:44
I should be so lucky.
@_date: 2016-01-15 03:02:46
That would be pretty big news if this sub-reddit was able to sink an open source implementation that the majority wanted.  I think you're overstating things.
  
You are free to discuss anything you want, you're just projecting your expectations on someone else by expecting to do what you want here.  That's not how this place has ever worked.  Have you forgotten why buttcoin exists?
@_date: 2016-01-13 03:22:56
I do worry about my preparedness with this regulatory environment.
@_date: 2016-01-13 02:59:19
I'm glad, it was meant for humor not malice. :)
  
Edit: :(
@_date: 2016-01-12 03:03:38
Happy to help.  In the video where he talks about encrypting his already generated private key and finds it favorable, I disagree strongly there since that just extends your liability and I find never rendering it to be a more secure path.

@_date: 2016-01-13 02:06:41
It was nice knowing you!
@_date: 2016-01-15 03:23:17
Zero to nuclear real quick!
@_date: 2016-01-15 03:25:03
This isn't a free speech zone in case you haven't noticed.  If you want to ignore the marketing that happens in real life in order to influence human behavior, that's fine, just don't expect me to live there with you.
@_date: 2016-01-07 03:13:17
Today is payday for a lot of people in the US so that might be playing a role.
@_date: 2016-01-12 04:19:34


That is not correct.
@_date: 2016-01-13 02:17:30
A three hour old thread with 200 upvotes is not common here.  Just sayin.
@_date: 2016-01-15 02:26:30
  
EDIT: I see you edited your post to include: 
  


  
The community was divided by the introduction of contentious software long before changes to this sub, not the other way around.  Do you have more?  I'm seriously interested.
  
EDIT 2: HAH!  I am -6 here and 3rd in /best, I bet if I downvoted the top two I would be top.
  
EDIT 3: Dear Diary, this is my first and final entry.  It looks as if my downvotes are not enough to overcome "Agree!" and "If only...".   Two statements that pretty much cover my entire life.  I am stuck at number 3 with -10 points in /best.

theymos doesn't fuck around?
@_date: 2016-01-15 03:16:59


  
I think you're overstating.
  




  




  
That's just from the first page, I didn't bother with the next few years.  I recommend you watch and listen, maybe have a more honest opinion until you aren't relying on so many others for yours.
@_date: 2016-01-13 02:52:16
Peoples excitement leads to things like war.  Make no mistake about the effectiveness of a good public campaign to get what you want.  is the  channel for news and discussion on bitcoin for most followers and it will be used if there is any attempt to co-opt this community.  Keep your eyes peeled. ;)
@_date: 2016-01-13 02:48:35
How about we talk about the responsibility we have to also scrutinize and vet whatever consensus mechanism we are looking at?  You know, while we're at it.
@_date: 2016-01-13 03:32:34
They're just so emphatic.  *There is no other choice because this is happening*.  /dr.evil
@_date: 2016-01-13 03:13:20
I think the issues raised are in the public view enough to where people are informed and can investigate on their own.  Look at us here now.  There are layers here in the audience and this is a big line.
  
Marketing appears to be limited here for hard fork software and I like that.   I think it is good for bitcoin in the long run.
@_date: 2016-01-15 04:01:40
Lots of marketing.  I think theymos excuse for moderation is marketing too and I agree the altcoin excuse is BS.  Fuck excuses!  But that's not good P.R..
@_date: 2016-01-13 02:08:15
Their verification method to ensure one person equals one vote is totally laughable and easily gamed.
  
I'm being downvoted, hah.  You should seriously look at their verification process.  A process they intend to use to convince us that one vote equals one person.  It is a selfie with your name on it, it is a joke.  And it immediately limits those that will participate because many, especially bitcoiners want to remain anonymous as possible.  The whole premise is flawed from the get go!  
@_date: 2016-01-15 05:01:51


  
As best I can tell, bitcoin was *intended* to replace banks, not people.  Or am I the bank in this scenario??  This is getting weird if so.  This would mean that bitcoin has *succeeded* and everyone is trying to convince me that it hasn't.
@_date: 2016-01-07 03:45:32
Can you link to these documented lies?
@_date: 2016-01-12 03:11:38
1) Verify with gemini.com.  
2) Transfer 500btc to account.  
3) Sell said 500btc.  
4) Profit.  
5) Pay your taxes while on a beach in a tropical paradise.  
@_date: 2016-01-05 02:00:16
2 Years ago it wasn't a default sub-reddit.
@_date: 2016-01-15 02:52:29
Too busy doing.
@_date: 2016-01-15 04:35:06
That explains everything. o_O
@_date: 2016-01-12 02:10:16


  
That makes zero sense given that their entire business is buying\selling bitcoin.  People need to use bitcoin for that to happen.
@_date: 2016-01-15 03:20:09


  
Control.  This is a well known sub that can influence the opinion of a lot of people who don't look at anything other than headlines or submissions titles and maybe the first comment or two to form their own opinion.
  
@_date: 2016-01-15 02:30:00
Should theymos bow to the loudest voice in an arena where it is trival to have many voices controlled by one person?
@_date: 2016-01-12 02:40:37
I think Electrum supports BIP38 but is not itself a BIP38 wallet.  [What is BIP38?](
  
Yes, you should be able to do this.  I personally have a hard time memorizing 12 words so I would still have to record it somewhere and encrypt it and to me that just adds complexity where I don't need it. 
@_date: 2016-01-13 03:09:58
If someone does it on their own, then there is nothing that can be done about that part.  But to do it without convincing a majority, there will be huge repercussions, so you won't see that.  You will see attempts to market and sell, to convince a majority to agree to a possibly rigged system.  It doesn't matter if I run the software, it is insulting to think it would even matter in that scenario.
  
We need to look hard at whatever consensus mechanism is put forth.
