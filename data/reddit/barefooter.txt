Exactly. This gox crisis is drawing tons of attention to bitcoin, and once it blows over prices are going to take off like crazy.

One disgusting quote from the thread about the patch for the crash:
"You are talking as if the bugs (this one and the one from previous week) were even serious.
OK, software is crashing, but nobody even lost any money, there is a working workaround."
Are you fucking kidding me! These devs talk as if they're developing some casual piece of software that will be used by a few thousand people. I wouldn't even trust them to do that. They are so far out of their league working on a protocol that secures nearly 20 Billion dollars. There is ZERO room for error. I cannot even believe they have gotten this far with this rag tag development process.
Also, he's completely wrong, people are loosing money, because they are preventing growth of Bitcoin. There's good reason to believe the price would be significantly higher right now if it wasn't for this cluster, so yeah they're costing people millions of dollars.

But come on guys, it's not anything serious happened, it just crashed :)

I'm not saying Coinbase is without issues, but the idea that they're trying to profit off transactions in this way seems pretty far fetched. They make a consistent profit off the buy/sell spread, why would they go through the trouble to identify a small percentage of transactions that are profitable to cancel? It seems like a very unlikely scenario to me.
I think some people just don't understand how exchanges make money. They make money on volume based on the buy/sell spread, so they're making money when the market is going up just as much as when it's going down, assuming the volume is the same.
EDIT: I just want to add that I think the most likely scenario for most these Coinbase issues is that they're playing it very safe regarding following banking regulations, and at times are triggering false positive fraud reports. From a business perspective, Coinbase is exposed to risk from government penalty if they don't precisely follow the banking laws. Being that they're new to the banking game, I'm guessing that they've chosen to play things ultra safe as they have little power to lobby/negotiate with officials. I'm sure they'd rather piss off a few customers than loose their licenses and potentially their entire business.
I'm kind of sick of all the pissing and moaning about Coinbase. A big point of Bitcoin is, like the internet, that it's open to ANYONE. That means even large nasty corporations can provide services which you may not deem to be within the ideology of bitcoin, just as similar companies can have a presence on the web, even if they don't give two shits about open information. Now if they fucked up and you lost money, or other issues, I agree that sucks and they need to do everything possible to resolved it, but they have no obligation to subscribe to the version of Bitcoin ideology that you do, and can still provide a service that many value.

It's not like he's made a gamble on a highly volatile currency that can be used buy hookers and blow or anything.

I'm getting kinda sick of these anti coinbase posts. This really is a problem with all exchanges, not just coinbase. They just have more users, so more complaints. I'm not trying to excuse their behavior, but you just have to understand that all exchanges are growing rapidly, and don't have enough customer service staff to deal with issues. I've personally had way more trouble with Kraken and Poloniex customer service, and Coinbase was always prompt. Sure, I'm not doubting others have had issues, but switching to another exchange is not necessarily going to make things any better.

You do realize segwit is literally a block size increase along with all the other changes?
@_date: 2017-04-06 00:37:49
What are the 13 extra hashes needed for non empty blocks?
@_date: 2017-04-14 10:46:41
How is this comment getting upvoted, it's seriously lacking any intelligence. All exchanges operating in countries that require KYC/AML have to implement it, or they will very quickly be in deep legal trouble and forced to close down. This has nothing to do with coinbase. Kraken, gemini, poloniex, bittrex, etc. are all doing the same thing. Do you have any idea what the price of bitcoin would be right now if there were no KYC/AML certified exchanges? I'd guess under 100.
@_date: 2017-04-07 07:29:30
It's doing less hashing, which means both less power and less time on average to find a block. So yes there would still be an advantage with free power, as you'd find more blocks.

This video makes me loose it every time. Thanks OP, I needed a good laugh!
@_date: 2017-04-14 10:52:08
Because there are lots of people that have a lot of power in the bitcoin economy, but lack any depth of technological understanding. Bigger blocks sounds like a simple solution to scaling, but it's far from ideal and undermines the most important properties of bitcoin. But, simple solutions sell well to the uninformed masses, and thus we are where we are.
It's kinda like how Trump got elected, he sold simple solutions (that don't really work and won't be implemented) to people who don't really know what's going on. Instead of calling roger ver bitcoin jesus, we should call him bitcoin trump.

This is awesome, especially if it's open source, but I still don't understand why we need cars that go so fast for commuting. It seems like they could have gotten away with a smaller engine and a much lower top speed. I wonder what the MPG rating would be if this thing had something similar to the geo metro 1l 3 cylinder, instead of the civic 1.8l 4 cylinder. I guess people are brainwashed to want high top speed and fast acceleration for that daily race of slogging down the freeway in traffic, so it probably wouldn't sell well with a top speed of 80 and slow acceleration.

Damn, well done Coinbase! Lets not forget how much they have done to bring Bitcoin into the mainstream, even if their customer service does suck at times.

Buy now, or you're going to really feel sad when $3k comes.

Also, just a tip if anyone is considering buying a Raspberry Pi to run a full node, I'd recommend getting an intel NUC instead. I recently setup a Pi 3 using dual 128gb thumb drives as a RAID array for storage, and while it works, it's pretty underpowered and still cost me a bit over $100 for everything.
More recently, I purchased an older Intel NUC used, for a bit over $200 including the RAM and HDD. It's such a superior machine for this purpose, and I can also use it it for other purposes like a dev server. I'm super impressed with the NUC, it's a really awesome little box.

I think eventually online bitcoin storage will be more secure than personal storage for the average individual. For people who know what they're doing, controlling your own private keys is the way to go, but if you're sloppy or not competent, it can lead to massive losses. 
Most the modern exchanges have very good security, use cold wallets, and some form of insurance, and this is only going to get better, until many of them are on par with banks in terms of security. There is a big market for it, so it's only inevitable that there will be bitcoin "banks".  Many of the hardcore bitcoiners just don't understand that they are very different from others, and most people don't want to control their own private keys.

Nice. Glad to see other people are doing this. Frankly I'm a little surprise how few people seem bothered by the seed being a single point of failure in the security system.
@_date: 2017-05-21 18:24:56
I'm not buying it. I think they've just spent a lot of money developing some very sophisticated curve fitting algorithms, but need to publish something that sounds good to keep the grants coming in.
I mean, do you have any idea how much fucking money you could make if you could predict the value of anything with that kind of accuracy? There is no way someone would just give out that money printing machine for free, they'd keep it secret and make a fortune.

Do you have any idea how fast the dev community is growing on Ethereum? Rootstock may be cool, but all the devs doing smart contract work are on Ethereum and not likely to switch easily.

I looked into the cryptosteel but didn't feel like it was the solution I was after. It solves the permanent backup problem, but not the secure backup problem. And after all, Ron Swanson advised against the type of thing you're suggesting :)
"That’s decoy gold. You think I’d leave my gold in a locked safe buried underground where anyone could find it? You don't know me at all"

Oh sorry, I thought you were saying to store the seed unencrypted. Yes, you're correct.
@_date: 2017-05-21 19:58:17
But that misses my point that the seed can be compromised without the password or the device being compromised. Even if it's locked up in a bank vault, the single point of failure worries me.
