Edit: Pretty cool. All that extra power will get some use.
@_date: 2018-09-06 20:21:22
Indeed. Been reading up on the subject for about a year. I read at least 1 bitcoin article a day. And i still learned some new things. Everything was very well explained.
@_date: 2018-09-08 07:59:49
Is the one on the left usdt?
@_date: 2018-09-08 08:14:54
It is actually twitters fault for allowing all these fake accounts that look legit. seriously most crypto pages on twitter are riddled with these. Luckily for me I realized quickly after reading the first one of these i seen was that there was no reason to send to confirm an adress, and realized it was scam. seriously though they will use a name so close to a real legit account i can see why some people fall for these.
Edit: dont make financial decisions right after smoking drinking and watching joe rogan podcast. Sorry for your loss buddy.

Same. Bullish long term indeed. And yes follow the opposite of the media/ the crowd. Good man. But every time btc bounces this year everybody is like oh we found the bottom great! But if you follow the charts the downtrend is not over. The correction is not over. Just being realistic. And it is really sad that anything realistic which just happens to be negative right now gets downvoted. We all want to see btc moon thats why we are here. Its just not gonna happen again for a while. Flat out. Quote me! Set reminders! Prove me wrong!
@_date: 2018-08-03 10:18:59
I would use TUSD
@_date: 2018-08-03 10:03:39
bitcoin cant do anything my money cant already do for me. And is much slower. When i have payed for anything in btc there is always a waiting period of 3mins to an hour before i can even purchase my items. there is already better options. apple pay for example. takes a whole few seconds.
Edit: And my money is not freefalling towards 0 as far as i can tell.
@_date: 2018-09-13 18:37:42
Yep my interest began in september last year. Just before the run up. Been watching intently ever since.

Ah. Silly bitcoin taking the shitcoins for a ride again. That little rascal!
@_date: 2018-08-04 19:18:15
First: i thank you for your time, and vivid description.
"people with wealth to protect to flock to Bitcoin.
Notice I said, "wealth," instead of "money".  There's a huge difference." You cant buy btc with wealth Unless you trade other assets peer to peer. You buy btc with fiat usually.
And at least with gold you can adorn yourself and it is a status thing. You cannot adorn yourself in btc. You cannot see btc. You cannot touch btc. its pretty much imaginary.
@_date: 2018-08-27 05:01:24
Just let go bear! Juts let go...
@_date: 2018-08-27 05:20:18
lol. anything But "Omg moon"  "Omg lambo" gets downvoted. At least you r/bitcoiners are optimistic.
@_date: 2018-08-04 01:22:05
@_date: 2018-08-03 20:47:25
Looks like they can take your btc on certain exchanges for someone else loss. [ And also btc is backed by nothing as well. And not insured or protected like fiat. And very easy to lose. No where near mainstream adoption and at this point i dont think it ever will be.
@_date: 2018-08-12 04:14:11
This is great. Perfect chart of the prices coming back to earth slightly. Hopefully before another takeoff.
Well made 
@_date: 2018-08-27 07:13:03

@_date: 2018-08-14 07:15:54
@_date: 2018-08-27 05:07:32
On the contrary. I would love nothing more than 1,000,000 btc by tomorrow. Hell right now. But I must be realistic. And so should you. The price is going lower. No matter how optimistic you want to be. The downtrend is real. I wish you would bet some money on your statement above. I would surely win. Because the price is going lower and btc will be at more of a discount soon. I promise you that. We  have not found the bottom buddy not even close. Go ahead set a reminder I hope you do so that when you get out of lala land and come back to earth you will see i/we are right.

Mcafee says 1,000,000 by 2020. not 500k he originally stated. There is even a website to track how his prediction plays out.

That bag tho
@_date: 2018-08-03 09:59:13
Well maybe because none of the aforementioned items are falling nearly as fast as btc over the last 7 months. Of course it might come back like it has in the past. but it might not.

@_date: 2018-10-15 07:14:39
Maybe peeps are moving to TUSD. Another stable coin. Up to 1.15 on binance right now never seen it so high.
@_date: 2018-10-15 07:19:09
Something big may be coming. As you said tether imploding. TUSD another stable coin on binance is up to 1.15 never seen it so high. Why would people be jumping ship on usdt so hard right now though? Could be bad for tether

It doesent really matter if they liquidate right away. That brings more volume. A government agency accepting btc as a form of payment is pretty good. At the very least its a step in the right direction for adoption. At best i think its kinda bullish. Of course no good news can turn this bear market around for right now it seems. But that will change eventually as it always does with btc.
@_date: 2018-11-28 10:37:48
Tether is very risky. Id use tusd or something else if I were to use a stable coin.

Me too man. But sadly we have to be realistic here. Unless we get at least 2 more bull runs matching the percentage rises of 2017 it is highly unlikely. And 2 such bull runs in 3 years has not happened yet. So far after such a run bitcoin goes sideways for quite a while. Maybe he knows something we dont. Maybe he was really high on cocaine when he ran the numbers. Only time will tell.

It is very hard to make money in a bear market. Everything is falling. If you want to keep trying. I would suggest swapping between a stable coin like usdt or tusd and trying to strengthen your positions ( by putting your funds on one of the stable coins while others are crashing then buying back in and getting more coins than you previously had).

1. Bitcoin is likely the first cryptocurrency a normal person will be introduced to. 2.
In most cases its easier to buy bitcoin and then trade it for another currency. (aside from ethereum and litecoin, but those were more recently made easily available). In the future hopefully it will be made easier to buy many other coins with credit/bank cards but until then, and probably quite a while after bitcoin will be top dog. Its not just the first mover its way ahead in the race. Until you start seeing multicurrency atms that deal in more than just bitcoin and all cryptocurrencys are easily available bitcoin will remain on top. When/if these other cryptos are made easily obtainable maybe they will be valued purely on use case speed and availability.  Your reasoning is just off. I do hard labor for a living and personaly never made the connection.

Well shertainly

Check out the chart. All year we have been creating new lower highs and new lower lows. If the etf doesn't get approved i believe it could be the catalyst for another crash/correction. Of course i could be (and hope i am) wrong. But until bitcoin dies in the media and we start reading bitcoin obituaries all over google news i do not believe we have found the bottom yet. Of course if that green line surpasses our previous high that would be a good indication we are out of the woods for now. But i don't see that happening. If it doesn't break up past that previous high,  and turns back downward, expect a new lower low than previous. [

haha! great how he added the lightning symbol.
@_date: 2018-07-26 02:09:57
HAha! You should write a book mate. So suspenseful, So emotional, So real! 
@_date: 2018-07-26 02:20:42
 Of course! Long term bullish. Short term still bearish.
@_date: 2018-07-26 00:03:24
slow bottoming process will end around 3500-4k. Next moon 70-80k. Just my call
@_date: 2018-07-05 23:19:46
you are correct. I will wait a while and post this somewhere more appropriate.

One small step for cryptocurrency = One giant leap for mankind! Boom!
@_date: 2018-07-19 06:26:19
Not really bullish but not so bearish either. The fact that there are so many asking and answering questions on a 5 minute timer is kinda dumb though. As soon as someone starts getting to the point times up. Alot more could/ should have been said.
@_date: 2018-07-20 05:48:15
It kinda goes up... It kinda goes down... It kinda goes sideways
@_date: 2018-07-25 02:23:31
awesome! I have several btc atms around my area. But im pretty sure you can only buy.
@_date: 2018-07-21 13:48:38


i was joking but in a way i see your comment makes sense as well.
@_date: 2018-07-19 06:27:22
You know how long it took gold to do that.... that chart goes back to the 80s or so
@_date: 2018-07-16 22:08:52
My call. Bottom at 3500. next moon 70-80k. 
@_date: 2018-07-03 01:44:18
Be reminded of 2013. That was a long slow crash. Price didnt even hit that high again until 2017. While some believe the market is different now and the correction will happen faster this time. Nobody/ very few really know. Could be back in a bull market now. Could be the middle of a long cold crypto winter. Do your research.
@_date: 2018-07-31 05:51:36
Upvoted for awareness. Hope you figure it out man!
@_date: 2018-07-19 06:59:01
Yeah man. Ive used 2 different btc atm's for about 5 transactions and always get a receipt. It is definitely not instant as  [Smashtray2](  says. At least not in my experience. But the longest i waited for a confirmation on chain was about 30 minutes to an hour. Then i could see my funds were on the way. A whole day is way too long. As others have said call the number on the machine is probably your best bet at this point. If you have no receipt or proof of the transaction they might not be able to do much though. A receipt should always come out.
@_date: 2018-07-19 07:13:02
So. Not sure if buying at 17 is legal so look it up. This will be for informational purpose only and i do not encourage you to buy anything. That being said. If you could buy legally i would do it like this. Get a good trusted wallet app for your phone or pc. I recommend electrum. (At least google if the wallet is trustworthy and read more than one opinion at the very least.) Now that you have a wallet hopefully you have a bitcoin atm in your area. Again Google! You will need a phone with active data to receive a confirmation text from the company that owns the atm before purchase. Take it slow and do your research so you dont lose your money. Before i made my first purchase from a btc atm i youtubed how to use a btc atm and when i got there it was very easy. Kudos and good luck young grasshopper.
@_date: 2018-07-22 04:46:12
haha. Same.
@_date: 2018-07-06 05:39:15
Gonna be 3500 soon. No lower. Next moon 70-80k
@_date: 2018-07-19 06:44:32
The title in the post was only one mans opinion (also just a couple minutes of a long hearing). And most of them had better opinions. One of the questioned guys in the hearing said they should stop taxing as capitol gains so it would be more likely to be used as a payment instrument. You could just as easily made something like that your title and make the whole hearing sound bullish. But your title makes it seem like the whole hearing was bearish. It was actually pretty neutral/ informational if you had the patience to watch more than 5 minutes of it.
@_date: 2018-07-19 07:29:30
Wishing you luck man. I really hope you sort it out and get your btc.
@_date: 2018-07-04 06:07:23
For those showing interest. I believe the picture was from [cryptotrunks.com]( I am not affiliated and cannot vouch for this company but they do sell these shorts.

New boring low. Around 3500. Next moon 70-80K. Just my call.
@_date: 2018-07-07 01:32:14
You forgot the point that the bitcoin supply is limited. (anti inflation) Duh
@_date: 2018-07-19 06:16:59
Sadly,  other than  a group assigned to study cryptocurrency you are correct. The fact that they are studying it could mean future involvement though. But for now It was fake news basically. 
@_date: 2018-07-09 21:10:04
Its nice seeing the dates going all the way back to 2013. Makes it a little easier to ignore the recent fud. Thanks op

@_date: 2018-07-20 05:23:18
Keep seeing this comparison. However the gold chart is in like 20 years time and only about 1-1 and a half years for btc. Not so good a comparison.
@_date: 2018-07-06 07:42:03
Hodl or fodl ? 
@_date: 2018-07-18 04:51:33
Feeling worse and worse for anybody shorting btc right now. Wait F that. Feed them to the bulls!

indeed. Not easy to hodl through. But if your not a trader its the only other option really. I am long term bullish as well.
