Agreed but you would be a soul-less person if you pick up and run with your BTC without looking after Dave, hey no one likes parting with 20% - but i guarantee you when faced with 100% loss vs 20% thats a walk in the park to me. I would like to think the BTC community is above that, we need services like what Dave provides, I even rounded mine up, to $1600 worth of BTC  - IMO an expensive mistake on my part, but a true lifesaver from Dave.

DAVE DOES IT AGAIN! So, my dumbass sets up a bitcoin account very late at night and about a month goes by and i havent used it - i credit 12BTC to it - i now got 12.22BTC in there and NO WAY! i cannot remember the passcode for the life of me. Bitgo, in all fairness - not truly helpful here and i'm literally migraine stress headache and panicking my butt off - i have tried seriously about 90 different combinations and nothing!! - they introduce me to Dave, who they highly recommend - i give Dave everything and i mean EVERYTHING - he wades thru all my crap multiple saves of passwords, etc, i even tell him it could be a random bunch of blah numbers etc. Now remember, at this stage i'm sunk - completely poked !! he tells me 20% fee, yeh cool, no worries. 
About 5hours later i get this email from Dave 
"Hi Rick
Good news!
I have found your password, which is 
This should allow you to access your funds again :)
