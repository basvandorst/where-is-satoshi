the true cost of complying with the CFTC wasn't the $75,000 fine it was really about $70million

More reports coming in from the Telegram channel that suggest these things are true:

This is good but if BFX already moved the coins -- would have been great if you found this way earlier 
@_date: 2016-08-03 17:20:34
I posted this elsewhere and will re-iterate -- the CFTC didn't "force" BFX to do anything -- they simply said that they weren't in compliance -- it was BFX's decision to cleverly use BitGo as something that would satisfy the delivery/custody component but the CFTC **does not advise** people on what to do to come into compliance that is something the BFX lawyers would do. Also we only know that BFX thought that allowed them to comply we actually don't know if the CFTC saw it the same way and more fines and penalties were on their way.

As someone who has directly spoken to the CFTC on this matter regarding BFX which resulted in the fines I feel I should comment here -- also I believe you just probably saw my tweet which made you create this post 
Notice though I say it is only ONE of the reasons they implemented BitGo as you are painting it as if the CFTC told them they couldn't use cold storage 
The CFTC didn't "force" BFX to do anything -- they simply said that they weren't in compliance -- it was BFX's decision to cleverly use BitGo as something that would satisfy the delivery/custody component but the CFTC **does not advise** people on what to do to come into compliance that is something the BFX lawyers would do. Also we only know that BFX thought that allowed them to comply we actually don't know if the CFTC saw it the same way and more fines and penalties were on their way.
For further proof that this is the case look at this line from 
"While Bitfinex was fined, it also settled its charges with the CFTC. However, the petition takes issue with the fact that the exact changes Bitfinex implemented to come into compliance were not made public, and that as such, any clarity as to how it satisfied the CFTC’s definition of delivery was never disseminated to the wider market."
I also actually was able to hear Phil Potter speak directly on TeamSpeak about the matter as well as you can scroll back through Zane's comments is that they "believed" they were in compliance with the CFTC but again we don't know what the CFTC's stance was because as the petition shows we don't have that clarity

that strawman argument doesn't hold any validity -- even if BFX thought what they were doing was bringing them into compliance they clearly didn't implement it correctly -- shitty implementation has nothing to do with the CFTC it is just poor dev work and execution

I want to make a point about the BitGo integration as a solution to comply with CFTC regs -- specifically that it was BFXs idea to do so and not under any direction of the CFTC -- the CFTC does not advise what to do to become compliant they simply say you are or are not compliant and we actually do not know if the actions surrounding the bitgo trick actually brought BFX into compliance from the CFTC's perspective only that BFX and it's lawyers thought so -- they didn't have to implement things that way they simply chose to because they thought they could cleverly be providing direct custody of the commodity in compliance with CFTC regs

More reports coming in from the Telegram channel that suggest these things are true -- ongoing so tune in: 
@_date: 2016-08-03 21:09:22
yeah I rather agree with you -- it was just what Bitfinex proclaimed after the settlement -- don't take my word take a look for yourself at what they said -- it was very well framed like CFTC was a dead issue they were on to other things now

The $65million hack wasn't enough ?
@_date: 2016-08-06 00:37:11
Ummmm no -- this isn't what it showing at all -- the hacked coins haven't moved but someone on OKC shorted a large but not all that uncommon size around that same time

Ummm no we just use more leverage and have less coin on exchange we will never stop gambling

WhaleCalls is not for plebs
@_date: 2016-08-03 04:24:18
no I am saying BFX's implementation of it was clearly not done properly -- it wasn't the ONLY reason for BitGo but ONE of the reasons

well here is your problem -- trading **isn't** a science -- it is far more art than science even if TA and indicators have mathematical calculations behind them -- they are just a tool to use to try and ascertain some of the internals at work with in the market at a given point of time considering other information as well but they aren't gospel in determining future price movement, it is much like saying going 55 MPH on the highway will result in safe travel, possible but what if there is 17 inches of snow on the road and what if your fuel gauge is on E or you are heading straight at a wall. 


See people say that like it is some shocking statistic and oh you will just lose day trading -- but day trading is very much so a profession that often takes years and multiple account blow ups to turn the corner and be profitable -- what is the percent of HS football kids that start in the NFL ? probably 0.00005% or something ridiculous, it is certainly far worse than 2% but most people can understand the level of sheer talent and years of practice that must happen to be able to compete at the NFL level -- too many people just look at someone staring at a chart and clicking buttons and say "well I can click buttons and day trade and make money" -- this is just as dumb as some fast food worker thinking they can just go and play in the NFL
