I will suggest a link to bitcoin.org. I remember an Austrian who ordered from bestertee.de and talked about it on bitcointalk. On my next order I could make an unboxing video.

Its drops to 8,90€ .

Indeed, such a list would be helpful. What about to buy a bigger pack size so a high shipping fee does not matter? As far as i know the 100% residue-free philosophy is unique.
EDIT: By the way look at the price per kilo. Its getting cheaper with higher pack sizes, so you can use the savings for the shipping....

Have you seen the changes? It is 5,60€ now.

Well the other shops sell it even if there are pollutions in the tea, even if it is organic because organic does not mean "free". Thats why i changed the shop. The owner posted a list of pesticides the laboratory found in a usual not very cheap chinese tea on bitcointalk.
But indeed we can see here that healthy and safe food is only avaiable for rich people. Sadly to say.

I know that earl grey is mostly not pesticide free. The owner of this tea shop was not able to get pesticide free earl grey (besides some other  types of tea)

You are right.
Just to be more clear: It was tested for unnatural radioactivity from the nuclear power station. Not for natural radioactivity, i think this would be nonesense. Please notice also that Potassium is less radioactiv than e.g. Cäsium-134. So if one atom of Cäsium-134 is near by your DNA the probability of damage is higher as if a atom of Potassium is near by your DNA.

I live in EU too. A Parcel with DHL costs usually 8,90 without tracking. Around 12 with tracking. I guess he send only parcels with tracking for that its cheap.

Yes do you remember Fukushima? Now it is allowed to have 500Bq/Kg radioactivity in Japanese tea (from the nuclear power station which is exploded there). bestertee.de test this and only if there is no (0Bq/Kg) radioactivity in the tea the tea are offered in the shop.
There are also some tea farmings near by nuclear power stations and nuclear waste facilities in other countries.

Well radiation is never safe if its inside you. Its only a question if 10000, 1000 or "only" 10 people get cancer. It is a propability. 500Bq/Kg is very high I would not drink it.
