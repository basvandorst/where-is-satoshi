Usd is not going to collapse and bitcoin will have no value if the global economy goes to zero. This argument is so dumb.

You think the usd being the reserve currency is the only reason the usd has value? 
That’s weird.

Controlling your cash isn’t going to stop conglomerates from reshaping the world in their image. The walls are closing in with or without bitcoin

I understand. It took me by surprise too. There's an investing ideology based on this fact though, and this timely forum post might be worth reading if you're interested in learning more.
Good luck!

Very, very few fund managers can consistently beat the market. Over the long term almost none can.

slave seems like a bit much. Defaulting on a mortgage means you lose a house.

The poor pay a greater % of their income to basic needs and taxes (housing, transportation, sales tax, gas tax, etc) than the rich.
It's great that you don't need to personally worry about it, but you might as well scrub that 40% figure from your head. It refers to income tax and its only purpose is to politically justify shifting the tax burden lower than it already is.

Yeah, none of this is going to happen. QE money can't 'break out' by design. It's a closed loop. People have been spouting this nonsense for years and it hasn't come close to happening.

Yeahh theft by the exchange itself shouldn’t be one of them.
