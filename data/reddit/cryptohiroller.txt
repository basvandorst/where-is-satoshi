If it wasn't opt-in, it would never exist on the bitcoin blockchain because no one in their right mind would scale by removing signatures. Segwit exists today on BTC because it was irresponsibly implemented by way of a soft fork, which makes non-upgraded software forwards compatible.

you do realize that a soft fork of the network, especially to add segwit, is far more detrimental than anything that a planned hardfork could ever do.
if you don't understand the tech, do the community a favor and stop posting misinformation.

Bitcoin.com has been owned by Roger long before BCH existed. And yes, he is incorrect about Roger forking BCH. More than anyone, that credit probably belongs to the Bitcoin ABC development team.

Isn't segwit opt-in?

Has lightning done anything for you other than give you stickers?
@_date: 2018-05-12 04:03:09
was it worth it to set up your channel and finding a merchant that accepts lightning?

why didn't you just use your bitcoin.com wallet like a normal sane person would?

time for y'all to boycott them too ain't it?!

You've got to be delusional if you think the low fees and empty mempool is due to SegWit.
