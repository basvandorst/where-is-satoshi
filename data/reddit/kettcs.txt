What is the current best place for people in the US to pick up Litecoin?

Fucking. Sick. So many &lt;3's.
Also, your album art as of late has been awesome, I'm especially partial to 14, 12, and 10.
Keep it up!

Thanks for your kind words, they do make me feel just slightly better. I wrote out what I thought would have happened in another comment, But I wanted to let you know that because of your comment and others I decided to finally follow through with starting up a wallet and getting into Bitcoin for real like I should have back then. I still think the concept is amazing.... Just currently painful to look at.
I am now the proud owner of 0.00008348 BTC, courtesy of TryBitcoin. I don't know whether to laugh or cry, haha.

Sometimes I wish I could just shut off all personal awareness of Bitcoins at this point... I missed an opportunity, simply due to laziness and apathy, by not following through with an intended purchase of $100 USD worth of Bitcoins back when they were about 5 cents; I had some spare cash at the time and I thought the concept was really pretty cool. I just told myself "Yeah, I'm gonna buy those tomorrow when I have some time."
I then forgot about them until I noticed one day they were $250+ USD. When Bitcoins hit $500 I will be a not-millionaire, due only to a lack of about 20 minutes worth of follow through.
Now whenever I see Bitcoin news I just become incredibly depressed and have to fight the urge to vomit due to the intense stabbing feelings of regret.

I see a lot of you guys pointing this out in the replies here, and thanks! that actually does make me feel slightly better about the situation. But I'm more one of those people who, with stuff like this, will recover my initial investment and let the rest ride. And remember, I was only going to purchase them in the first place because I thought Bitcoin was cool! I had been seething at that time about news stories of scumbag banks and their various manipulations, and that helped catalyzed my interest in Bitcoin when I first read about it. The primary reason was never really a pure investing "I'll make millions!" standpoint.
Knowing me, Here's approximately what would have happened if I had gone through with my transaction and Purchased 2000 BTC @ 5 cents each:
* For the first few days, continue to look for services and products that I was interested in that took BTC, and probably find nothing. (I had looked at this before deciding to buy them, found nothing, but then decided I would buy BTC anyway)
* Let it sit/forget about it for many months without checking it.
* Look into it one day, notice that BTC are now randomly worth $5-$10. Holy shit.
* Probably sell off about 50-200 of my 2000 BTC, to recover initial investment + a chunk of profit around $1000. Let remainder sit.
* Probably check in every so often now that the monetary incentive has made this more directly interesting. Search for stuff to buy. Maybe buy something? Call it -100 BTC.
* Bitcoins crash down to $3. Do nothing, already made cash, know how much they can increase. Ride it out. Probably stop spending them.
* See bitcoins going up massively, but also fluctuating rapidly. Do nothing, hope for awesome.
* BTC hits ~$150. Holy what-the-fuck, this is a fucking thing? Probably sell 100 of my remaining 1700 BTC for around $15k. Buy a nice ass computer. Buy physical backup devices for BTC wallet. Put 5k into my retirement account. Put the rest into my checking account.
* BTC crashes to $30. Sadness, regret, but have seen this crash once before. At this point I have no pressing unhandled monetary concerns in my life, so I can wait this out. Besides, I've already made like $16k off of $100. This is basically fun money at this point.
* BTC recovers, hits ~$200+. Got to make sure to make something before the next bubble pops. Probably sell off another 200, Pay down remaining loans. Now have about 1400 BTC and almost no debt to my name.
* Present day, BTC @ ~$470, how the fuck high can it possibly go? Countries are starting to use this now? Wow, this is here to stay. It's at this point that I would consider withdrawing a very large chunk of my remaining BTC, which is worth approximately $650,000. I would probably withdraw a third of it (~450 BTC), quit my job, and recruit a college buddy that I make games with as a hobbyist to start our own company and finally really improve our skills and try to develop and finish a couple game ideas we have while living off the cash.
* Leave my remaining ~900 BTC to ride. After all, Bitcoin is almost officially a "thing" now, and is seeing so much mainstream attention that it's everywhere I look. I can't even escape it on Reddit.
So, yes, it's probably almost a certainty that I wouldn't actually be a millionaire... but I'm also almost certain that events would have transpired similarly to the above and I would have at least a life-changing amount of money. I can't stop thinking about it and it kills me.
Again though, I appreciate the sentiment.
