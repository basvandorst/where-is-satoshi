Yes, the [inflation and oscilation]( of bcash is crazy. Good to see that this cycle there is almost [parity profitability]( even on the peak of BCH block pumping at a rate of [~30 blocks/hr](
Expect miners switching back to Bitcoin, bcash has had [close to 50% of the hash power]( Also the mempool will decrease as more blocks start flowing again.
Edit ---&gt; Here is a good explanation of the 'hash rate difficulty oscillation' phenomena:

Nobody, no individual and no central power or government can control, manipulate, ban, hack or kill a worldwide distributed open-source peer-to-peer cryptographically secured decentralised system.
Bitcoins will continue to increase in value, more than gold and silver, there will only be 21 million bitcoins ever, they are cryptographically and mathematically secured, it is decentralized, so can't be banned, co-opted or confiscated/stolen by any central group or government, you hold your own private keys.
The future economy is digital and decentralized.﻿

That's the exact same thing people said when it hit ATH $1 in 2009, then $10, then $100, now over $4000 and will continue to say at $10,000, $100,000...﻿and so on.

Segwit was already priced-in, the "kaboom" was supposed to be downward because of the 'sell-the-news' regular investing practice, but it didn't happen and that's good, expect a steady rise now.

Whatever China does is just FUD now, since nothing coming from China should "shock" us or Bitcoin anymore. Just consider China as well as dead and ignore all news coming from there.

Don't be so pessimistic and afraid, 
even if the internet goes down, it will be only temporary, and anyway, bitcoin can be stored offline on paper or hardware wallets and transferred via radiofrequency/radiowaves, a peer-to-peer decentralised system is not going to disappear, the future systems will be decentralised and digital.

For non-technical people, Coinbase Vault service is very safe, they store the coins off-line in cold storage and protected with multi-sig. It is more likely to lose your coins if you store them yourself, as history and statistics have proven time after time:

Just zoom out, every single time it has recovered higher than the previous ATH. Also, you are missing the point that Bitcoin's fundamentals remain stronger than ever, nothing has changed other than banker's FUD and China closing exchanges (which last time lasted 4 months) and even at that time, Bitcoin kept growing both in price and adoption &amp; development. So, your subtle disguised FUD argument does not stand.

Hey, one day redditor! Have you seen Bitcoin's price history? You seem grossly misinformed... or just FUD trolling.

It happened exactly as you predicted, it went down more than $100 (from $1456) all the way to the $1348 resistance/bottom and in bounced back from there. And now we are back down at that resistance level ($1350), it is showing strong, hopefully won't break down.
