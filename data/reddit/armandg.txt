How dystopian isn't that? The only thing left after all hell broke loose is the ticker, reminding us of the last price.

You should  absolutely read up on how banks work. You write a good text in general, but some of it may come as conspiracytheoretics.

Sorry if I wasn't writing as clearly as intended. English isn't my first language.
What I meant was that I have read other places (couldn't find the source, sorry) that a lot of the values in banks are:
- profit from customers paying for services
- investments (some big banks do)
- loan from other banks
So I can understand why you would say that banks create money out of thin air. I just don't think it is 100% correct. I'm pretty sure that there are nuances in this that can explain why it is the way it is.
As a geek, I would love to know more about how this work in practice. If you happen to come by any information on this then please let me know.
Again, sorry if it came off as me calling you names, was not my intention.

Check the chart: I'm talking about a leap from about $300 to $600.
And no, I don't "just check the price of btc once a year".
