The banking system system is the scourge of the world.  One group creating all the money and defining policies on how it is spent results in what we have today, very few people with MOST of the money.
I don't love bitcoin.  In fact, I think it would be far better if most new coins would go to everyone equally (very hard to implement) with more going to miners.  However, bitcoin is FAR better than the banking system as those that mined in the beginning will spend their coins and they cannot simply create more.

Being able to create money and give it to yourself is criminal.  Banks are a part of this so every one is a criminal organization.  
I have thought about the nature of inflationary vs deflationary currency.  I have gone so far as to suggest we create a digital currency where all new units are doled out to everyone equally.  I have thought that perhaps it's best if we try to peg this currency to whatever the value of the world's reserve currency is on a one for one basis.  1DCCoin is worth 1 USD.  However, if you understand this is happening, what is the point?  We know bitcoin is limited so clearly if it is used more, it will go up in value so your cheeseburger will cost less.  If you know this, will you spend less than a currency where you get an equal share of all new increments.  I'm not sure.  I doubt you'll spend less as a percentage of material value.  You'll still buy the same amount of cheeseburgers it's just you wont' have to get new increments monthly for the value of your money to continue rising--even as you spend it.
It is evil and wrong that banks, especially central banks create all new money and decide how it is used.  It is simply evil and wrong.

I'm not interested in convincing you of anything personally.  At this point, you're in "win an argument mode".  Also, I'm not yelling at you.  I could care less what you think of my "mental discipline".  Actually that was funny though.  I've never seen that.  I'm not trying to be personal with you. 
Slavery in the past was far more direct.  Monetary slavery is very, very sneaky.  You are actually defending a central groups absolute authority to print money at will.  I can't tell you how upsetting that is to me.  If that's you're goal, you've won whatever it is you wanted to win.  Seriously, the thing is you're not alone.  That is common as is the jealousy I described.  I'm not trying to be mean with that.  It's just really sad.  No one seems to give a damn.  In 10 years, your money has halved in value while those connected to bankers have enjoyed fabulous riches.  It is just so criminal.
Anyhow, good luck.  I hope you look into it even if you hate bitcoin.  I actually think bitcoin is not perfect at all.  A perfect money, to me would be one where any new units went to everyone on the planet equally with no central authority in control of it.

Well folks, this is what we like to call the game.  Let me explain.
Last month, Manchin — a member of the Senate banking committee — wrote a letter to officials including Federal Reserve Chairman Janet Yellen and Treasury Secretary Jack Lew, calling Bitcoin "highly unstable." 
What really happened is the Federal Reserve has approached congressman bought and paid for to give the appearance that  bitcoin is a bad thing.  This guy writes a letter (meant for us to see) to the Fed asking for help.  The Fed gets to look like good guys saying they have no authority and so now the IRS takes action.
I am pretty certain that ALL govt. officials are just puppets to the Fed who are MASTERS of perception.
If you could create money at will and enrich your friends, wouldn't you do everything in your power to hold onto that authority?
@_date: 2014-03-29 20:06:04
The audit would investigate exactly how the Fed uses it's funds (which ultimately it just creates) to ensure there is no self enrichment.  
This has been suggested many times by Rand Paul.  I don't belong to any party but I sure do agree with this.
Basically the Fed creates money in several ways by buying government securities, setting the fractional reserve ratio for banks and many, many quantitative easing measures.  The essence of this with govt. securities and qe is that the Fed has a HUGE stream of money owed it coming from various entities.  What are they doing with this money?  This should be VERY OPEN.
@_date: 2014-03-29 20:02:04
So clarification amounts to action without discussion on the IRS part?  I did watch the hearings.
@_date: 2014-03-29 19:58:40
An audit would provide a heatlhy dose of reality wouldn't you say?

Central banks are not the tool that the wealthy are able to corrupt.  Central banks ARE the problem.  I have ZERO problem with the wealthy.  If you create a fair monetary system and people are not reduced to slaves as they were in centuries past, most things will actually work out.
Bitcoin is NOT inequality on steroids.  It also is NOT perfect.  It IS far better than anything we've ever had in the past.  Yes, early adopters will do a lot better than those on the tail end, still they CANNOT just create money so ultimately if bitcoin were the primary currency used the world over, wealth distribution would go to those that actually did work and provided services to humanity.
In all likelihood, your jealousy over ordinary people that benefit from bitcoin is pretty common.  I would go further and say that is the primary thing that will keep us slaves to a banking system and something far more fair like bitcoin a fringe exercise. 
People seem to prefer being ruled absolutely by those they don't know than having those that came from them have any success.  Humanity is very odd this way.

Some say, Oh but the Fed is audited each year. The Inspector General responsible for auditing the Fed came before Congress in May of 2009, and here’s what she had to say to a question during a House Financial Services subcommittee hearing. A Congressman asked, “What have you done to investigate the off-balance-sheet transactions conducted by the Federal Reserve which, according to Bloomberg, now total $9 trillion in the last 8 months?”
The IG fumbled, she repeated herself. She looked silly and then she said: “You know, I think it may be important at this point to,” Yadda, yadda, yadda” and then several yaddas later this bombshell: 
"We do not have jurisdiction to directly go out and audit Reserve Bank activities specifically." 
So, don't let anyone tell you we already have an audit of the Fed. No meaningful audit of the Fed exists and when the primary auditor and overseer of the Fed was asked about $9 trillion dollars, the Inspector General had no clue what had been purchased with $9 trillion dollars. Is there a chance, that the Fed only has our best interests at heart? Sure. But when trillions of dollars change hands, wouldn't you want to know who got the money and did anyone enrich themselves in the process? $9 trillion is over half of our entire national debt. This is money that is being doled out, in secret, by our central bank. This is, in a sense, laundering money from the American people to bail out big banks and Wall Street.

Also, even if people could have barely enough of a life to exist on with a basic income, I doubt most people would want that.
It is simply immoral in my book for any group of people to get new money first.  I personally think it's evil.  The Fed isn't the only money creators, regular banks create money as well and they also decide who gets loans.  You best believe they are enriching their friends and family.  I would.  You would too.

A Government Accountability Office report on virtual currencies urged the IRS to reduce tax-compliance risks by issuing a guidance. The appendix of that report contains a letter from IRS Deputy Commissioner Steven T. Miller, who assured the office that the IRS is “working to address these risks.”
So you're saying from this report on issuing "guidance" Steven Miller just decides to declare it property thus stifling it's use as an ordinary currency.  Well that makes sense if Steven Miller is either a complete douche or an absolute idiot.
So it is your estimation that Steven Miller is an idiot or a douche?  It couldn't be that another group that stands to lose trillions if bitcoin is successful had a hand in it. 
Well you've convinced me.  Competition for wealth in no way played a part in it.  I give up.  Following the money, a concept that has worked since the dawn of humanity is simply not relevant here.  
I say we don't even worry about establishing motive anymore.  That concept is just silly.
@_date: 2014-03-27 20:34:07
Well he does have it wrong but the reality is FAR worse.  The FDIC is a government corporation(oxymoron if I've ever heard one). 
Let's imagine what would happen if there was a run on ALL banks with everyone wanting their money.  The FDIC would step in and cover accounts up to 250,000 each.  The FDIC does not have this kind of money.  They would quickly eat through all their funds.  The US govt. would step in and "temporarily" take over.  What this really means is they would pay the debts.  The Federal Reserve would buy these debts and the US govt. would then owe the Federal Reserve.  Ultimately this obligation would be paid in taxes by American citizens to the government which would pay the Federal Reserve.  
Where did the Federal Reserve get this money?  They created it...poof...here's your money which you now owe me back with interest.  Nice trick huh?
So, FDIC insurance is really another way we all are indebted to the Federal Reserve (central bankers) for money they just wish into existence.  
It's good to be the king!
@_date: 2014-03-28 22:55:51


I was referencing your comment.   You seem to have a LOT of trouble focusing.  In your comment you skipped the step of the Fed giving money to the government and the taxpayers paying for that money.  I did the same thing.  


Bitcoin is not the perfect system.  It is FAR better than giving a group of people unlimited money creation power forever.  Those that got into bitcoin early will exchange them for harder assets over time and cannot simply create more money.  When it's gone, it's gone.
What the Fed does is buy various securities from the government which means the tax payers foot the bill.  This is only one aspect of the Federal Reserve creating money.  Below is a more detailed account of what they do:
The Fed is a group of private central banks. They essentially create money to pay for various government securities. They create this money out of thin air. Poof...here's your money. They can also create money in other various ways by controlling the interest rates banks can borrow money at (poof...here's your money) and the reserve to deposit ratios banks must follow (fractional reserve mojo). They are also involved in various other "quantitative easing" schemes that essentially amount to creating new money for banks including themselves. I would go further and wager that when you are the "lender of last resort" and aren't audited, you're likely creating money for lots of things people don't know about and better not ask about. The rabbit hole goes much deeper when you understand the whole basis for fractional reserve banking which basically means banks only have to hold a fraction of money in "reserve" or at the actual bank based on deposits that are made. They can actually lend out more than they have when new deposits are made. Now, if you control this system or are a large bank that creates money upon new deposits, how are you going to loan that money out? I know what I'm going to do, I'm going to create policies that make it perfectly legal for me to loan large amounts of money out to friends and family. Essentially those involved in the money creation process can enrich themselves while devaluing the dollar for everyone else. Nice little scheme isn't it? If you are a Keynesian and believe in economic stimulation and spending/borrowing your way out of recessions then that's fine. I say we stop letting a few bankers decide who gets the new money but rather give it to all Americans equally.
The real question is what is the Fed doing with the money they get back as repayment.  Also, who is benefiting from their "quantitative easing".  A lot can fall under that and unless they are fully audited, you can be certain there is corruption.
Anyhow, I've come to the conclusion that you are a racist dolt that just likes to read what you write no matter how wrong you are.  Good luck with your trollings.
@_date: 2014-03-30 13:41:22

@_date: 2014-03-29 21:35:20
Ha...I just saw your comment.  I can't express to you just how much I'm swimming in my element here.  I'm not going to go over it again but look at my responses to someone else posting links of the Fed's audits (laughable).
Also, just so you can quickly realize the absurdity of the link you have provided, look at the date.  The 9 trillion in question occurred 3 years BEFORE this "data".  This is a primary complaint against the fed.  In 3 years a TON of data can be massaged and facts can be made up.  When you don't have near real time audits of the money creation process, there really is no real data.  
Anyhow believe what you like but let me leave you with this which goes to the heart of my problem with our money creation process.
No single group should get all newly created money first.  This is evil.  Our current system is evil.  New money should very closely go to all individuals equally.  If you do not have this system then you should have a system where you simply don't create new money or create very little(bitcoin).
Bitcoin is NOT perfect but the fact that newly created money cannot simply go to some chosen few indefinitely is FAR better than anything before.
@_date: 2014-03-27 16:39:04
Yeah, I was just responding to the guy in love with his bank.  I am talking about more than just devaluing though.  New money literally goes to banks first (especially central banks) and they decide how it's spent.  You best believe they are filtering to their friends and family.  I would.  Everyone would.  It is very evil.

@_date: 2014-03-27 17:26:28


I've heard this before.  It really is disheartening to know people will nearly defend to the death central bankers being able to create money.  I'll tell you what.  I'll trade places with them.  Let me devalue my own money by giving me the ability to create it.  This argument holds no merit.  Over time their money supply would be devalued, still not only would they have a LOT more than everyone else, they also have the luxury of spending the money FIRST before it devalues at all.  (It takes a while for new money entering markets to have an inflationary effect.)
So while you might say "they will offload them at some point", Bitcoin's deflation means they will easily maintain control of the supply while having to "offload" less... in the deflationary stage of Bitcoin, those that are not forced to spend to cover their expenses get wealthier by doing nothing at all.
They will offload less, still they will offload.  I would argue that it would be far greater than just covering expenses also as most people in that position would want to ensure they have hard assets such as land, etc to make sure they are set even if bitcoin fails.


Everyone will prefer bitcoin over fiat.  No one wants to hold onto a depreciating asset when they can trade it for one that appreciates.


I wish I did.  What you're championing is a system that awards oligarchs for nothing and impoverishes working people and business owners.  Mind you, I am specifically talking about bankers--especially central bankers.  
At the very least, I hope we can agree that the Federal Reserve should be audited.  We should ensure that as new money is created, they are not enriching themselves in the process.

The IRS, like most of "our" government, is the Federal Reserve's bitch.  It is simply being used here to slow bitcoin adoption.
The Federal Reserve (a few large banks) pretends to not be interested, has Senators write open letters about how terrible bitcoin is responding with kindness all the while pulling all the strings and managing public perception.

The Fed is very concerned with Bitcoin and they HAVE taken action.  The IRS decision our of nowhere has nothing to do with the IRS.  The IRS will not act unless prompted and someone prompted them to act. It was certainly the Fed that did that.
They are simply managing perception as with everything they do right down to being called the Federal Reserve.  They are not Federal in any governmental sense and they certainly aren't a reserve since they simply create money.
@_date: 2014-03-27 02:25:45
The point is people are unaware that a private entity creates new money at will and sets the reserve rates for all other banks to create money via the fractional reserve system.

@_date: 2014-03-27 22:09:06

Now I'm no uber bitcoin fan, libertarian, democrat, etc, etc.  What I truly think is there is a LOT of self enrichment.  Not directly mind you but indirectly.  
I think what should happen is money creation should be turned over to our government AND most new money that is created should be issued in the form of a basic income to all citizens.

Only there are far more workers now.  There simply is no benefit to one group having the authority to print money at will.

I have personally reviewed these before.  Actually many times.  Did you look at ANY of those or were you thinking you had some kind of smoking gun.  THESE ARE NOT REAL AUDITS.  This is my point.  Open up those pdfs and see if you see any info on where money is actually coming from and going to.  You only see general groups.  THAT IS THE POINT.

The real question is, What is Coinbase reporting?

Agreed.  Who made the choice?  Who authorized it?  Who decided it was time.  Let's not look at the IRS as a shadowy group but rather as an organization with a chain of command, which it is.

Doesn't look like it.  I'd like to be hopeful but it appears we are going to settle into true value territory and right now probably less than 100k people even use bitcoin for a currency.

That does not cut it for me with the money creation process.  Sorry.

Very few people understand the money creation process.  If they fully comprehended it, they'd be up in arms.  Sure they'd defend their previous positions for a while because, hey, who doesn't like to win, but when reality dawned on them, they wouldn't like it very much.
In an extreme situation, the government steps in and the taxpayers collectively foot the bill.
This isn't the bad part.  The bad part is the taxpayers get the money from a central group that just creates it.  The taxpayers then have to pay interest on that money.  Wouldn't it just be oh so cheesy to be part of this group?  Count me in for one, if the central bankers want someone to throw their money at!!!
The inherent evil in this system is this group is not audited in any significant way.  No one knows precisely what they do with the money they create.
Personally, I don't think bitcoin is perfect.  It's better than letting some unaudited group of oligarchs have free reign over our money but there are some other possibilities.
In my opinion, new money should go to everyone equally.  This way no group gets to give their friends and family all the rewards.  One thing that could be done is take the money owed to the fed that is above what they need to pay salaries and manage their operations and distribute it to the citizens in the form of a basic income.  That actually might be a pretty fair system.










Not sure I got all the name calling there.  Maybe I missed one or two.  Anyhow, angry apes are rarely right.  Don't be an angry ape.

I've been around for over a year.  This time feels different.  I can't explain it.

If you want proof ask yourself this:  Do government officials do ANYTHING that could jeopardize their jobs unless prompted in some way?
They don't.
