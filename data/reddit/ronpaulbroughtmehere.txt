Apparently. But maybe it is all just a big giant joke played on humanity, with at the end turning out, it was a plot by the New World Order Globalists to have us happily get a world currency, that after a while they will have it centralized "for your own safety" of course.

Impeached and removed? After a year of heavy allegations and investigation they have absolutely nothing on Trump, but plenty on Hillary and the Leftists have fallen apart.

Time Magazine already asked Trump but he declined. There would be a interview going along with the award and mainstream media is a known leftist lobby and are known to treat him unfairly/misquote him/slander him. If you are a revolutionist you better stay far away from controlled mainstream system media. Nothing good can come from it. Bitcoin is not there only target.

His popularity has risen since elections where he won with a large majority of votes after the Leftists lost the election despite widespread vote rigging.

Been to Britain and saw the development of Islamic take over of British society. If the Brits would not have voted for freedom and independence, Merkel would have send and speed up Britains Islamisation project. People like you need to realise you can govern your own country, you dont need unelected Juncker dictator overlords telling you how to spend your money, how to deal with your borders, how to run your laws and lifes. Thankfully braver Brits have taken away power from the naive leftists.

It was one of the biggest Wins in history. He also won the popular vote because the Leftists engaged in widespread vote rigging, they lost despite atleast 3.5 million dead people voted for Hillary. A Investigation started immediately. Soon there will be Voter IDs because of what the crooked Leftists did.

It was Obama, Hillary and there European Leftist colleges who financed and armed radical Islamists Rebels in Libya and Syria to have huge Wars. The Leftists bombarded Libya into anarchy and radical Islamic paradise. After the Leftists destroyed Syria and Libya they helped channel millions of there population into Europe for there next conflicts, trouble and divisions.
Trump, Brexit, Le Pen, Wilders, FPÖ, Five Star Movement, Czech Republic, Poland, Orban, AFD, the peoples revolution is ongoing and Trumps success shows the way that great change is really possible. By ending the support for the radical Islamic Rebels Trump has ended the War in Syria. Something the Leftists would have never done in a hundred years.
The point is Andreas comes across as a hypocrite when he says there should be less divisions and infighting in the community, then goes ahead to post childish Trump bashing postings dividing his community and Bitcoin community more then before he said anything.

A Ponzi scheme is basicly three things. 
It promises garanteed profit if you do this or that = Nobody promises you any profit for getting the bitcoin currency.
A ponzi scheme needs continued inflow of new and more money to sustain itself. Bitcoin does fine even staying years on the same rate, even if no new or more money would come into the system, the currency would continue working without a problem.
A ponzi scheme has a centralized structure. Bitcoin is decentralized.

Yesterday I wanted to pay in a restaurant with bitcoin. I first had to transfer btc from my nano s to xapo. I had three network error messages before it went through. Then I realized I had to pay 7.90€ in fees for a 50€ transfer. This is crazy despote choosing "slow transfer".
In the pizzeria then me and the waiter were not sure how we are going to implement the fees into the payment. Both having xapo. There was no way knowing before paying how high the fees would be and we didnt find an option inside xapo to see which fees option (fast or slow) could be changed to avoid fees. The others on my table were discourage to dee how long it takes and the uncertainty involed in doing a bitcoin payment. Me and the waiter decided to roughly guess the fees and split them. Instead of 21.30€ I send 19€. It was quite a inconveniant process and until today I still dont know whether me or the waiter ended up with the fees and how much it was.
I'm not a Bcash guy and I know/hope these issues wil be solved in the next year but these are serious problems for a currency.

Trump is the best presidential material the US has had since John F Kennedy. Thanks to Trumps huge success and after a great year in office all western countries are now voting right wing and patriots aswell into office, the leftists globalists War mongers are losing in every election. 
Andreas is the biggest spokesperson for Bitcoin. By childishly bashing Trump he has taking a political stance in a way that exposes every stupid Hillary supporter. Andreas should have kept his unncessary bashing to himself instead of divided and starting pointless discussion and arguments amongst the bitcoin community and his (former) supporters.
He obviously believes what the leftists mainstream media teached him about Trump. Andreas the Hillary supporter.

Free trade is very bad for every country and only good for large corporation. Everything you wear, everything you have could be produced locally without sending hige ships x times around the earth just to have your stuff made by little hungry children for free in a third world country.
