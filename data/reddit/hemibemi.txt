ok... sorry, guess I'm new to this.  I guess just have to wait till the block goes through or something.  Been like 5 days already and I paid the higher transaction cost option as well.

So basically decentralised dropbox?
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:08:51
Yeah, I was asking someone to explain it like I'm 5.  Not confused about ELI.
@_date: 2017-11-18 11:48:19
"delisted and then re-added" Is what I took.  Only asking questions.  I'm pro BTC
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:12:35
I'm confused. ELI?
@_date: 2017-11-04 09:12:42
Electroneum is the coin for that.

Sure they made a ton of money but might not have been able to pull off the plan.  But there are still many many hours to go before correction so this might not be the end yet.

What if BCH ends up taking BTC name on exchanges.  Would this make the new BTC the same underlying asset?  
Just trying to make sense of the plays each side are making.

Thanks.  I'll do that.  One will go high, one will crash.  I don't mind losing my free coins.  I'll take the good coin which should be Bitcoin.  Again thanks

Good question.  Let's throw Segwit2x in the mix. Suppose the rogue minors go ahead.  Could their be a scenario where BCH goes up and BTC &amp; B2X goes down?
@_date: 2017-11-12 13:58:26
Lost coins I'd imagine.
I have a coworker who lost 10,000 coins.
Edit: I see he has recent coins added.
@_date: 2017-11-05 07:02:15
Thank you.  So it's a good idea to transfer to my paper wallet (or my ledger coming in the post)
So I can hold this till like months after the fork if I wanted right and get my BTC and B2X later on. One of them will crash of course but I'm ok with losing a bunch in one, just want to safe guard the successful coin.
@_date: 2017-11-06 14:03:12
You're right I think. So believe and dump the 2x coin early.  
I think BTC will win.  I just don't care if I lose a early payout on 2x coin that's all.  Happy to watch it burn to the ground and burn my 2x or sell real cheap in a year.
@_date: 2017-11-18 11:25:59
Thanks - yeah they will go to whichever is the biggest coin in the future, be it BTC, BCH or something else.
@_date: 2017-11-04 02:38:27
But a paper wallet you can claim your B2X later on?
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:02:10
Nope.  But will just hold for a year or 2
