I convinced my new wife to use a portion of our wedding gift money towards BTC. Not 20k worth but a decent chunk.

I think it came out to around 15-18% on total cap gains.
@_date: 2018-05-01 15:58:09
If you hold for over a year the rate comes down. I think the highest cap gain rate is under 20 tho.

Not many people in the world have access to 10s of thousands of dollars in credit. You typically already have to have good credit established to have minimums that high. Haven't you ever heard of a debit card?

I was just at a party and showed a group of 7 people how to buy BTC after being asked 10k questions about crypto. Public interest is there. People are just lazy when it comes to figuring this shit out on their own. Everyone I've taught over the years has been amazed how easy it can actually be, they all thought it was much more complicated.

Guess we won't be needing that border wall and we can shut down the concentration camps since illegal immigration is no longer a thing.

**Which is why Trump is trying to get help from the Mexican government, because our own congress surely won’t come to a compromise with him.**
\-Patently false. Congress originally offered him more than what he was requesting when threw a temper tantrum and shut down the government. He wants this to be an issue so that he can continue to use it as a rallying cry for his base in seeking re election.
**If we start capitulating to these people, it will embolden even more to cross the border illegally, which will make the infrastructure even more crowded.**
\- There is an ocean of middle ground between capitulation and locking children in cages and indefinitely deterring human beings in squalid conditions for breaking the mortal law of touching American soil without proper paperwork.
**Deporting illegals already here will further dissuade people from entering our country illegally.**
\- There's very few people on the left who don't support a degree of deportation. Get out of the conservative/twitter bubble. Grab a beer with your friendly neighborhood liberal. We don't all bite, and are generally reasonable people despite how those clickbait SJW youtube videos portray us.
**Not to mention what an actual border wall will do to the numbers coming across.**
\- Not a whole lot considering a growing majority of illegals here are people overstaying their visa's and border apprehensions have been decreasing for over a decade.
**What do you propose we do about it? Because simply complaining about the problem gets nothing done.**
\- Not doing the thing that has our nation being compared early nazi Germany globally would be a solid start.

Yes, but we should also be at least attempting to treat those individuals humanely. Caging children and housing people in standing cells for weeks at a time is not humane.
"In a report issued Thursday in which it calls for immediate action, the United States Department of Homeland Security’s Office of Inspector General detailed several striking observations about the conditions at the El Paso Del Norte immigration processing center gathered during unannounced inspections in early May.
Despite federal standards saying that people should generally not be detained for more than 72 hours, some people were held in “standing room only” cells for weeks, the report said. Investigators found that there was limited access to showers and clean clothes, the report said. Some people were “wearing soiled clothing for days or weeks,” the report said.
Investigators found 155 people in a cell that was supposed to hold 35, and 41 people in a cell that was supposed to hold eight. Nine hundred people were being held at the center on one day in May — far exceeding its capacity of 125."

To tag on here...when a recession or crash hits the institutions that's are propping the market up are selling and waiting on the sideline to buy at blood red levels and restart the cycle. I guess an argument can be made that some of these characters could start investing/trading in crypto while the markets sorts itself out. Just not sure that's what would happen.
