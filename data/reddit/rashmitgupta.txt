This is really fishy !
As per blockchain records....
I made a deposit of 50BTC  on 2nd August 10.40 UTC which didnt reflected in my BFX account till system shutdown.
When i tried support at BFX said there is a issue with deposits and shall be soon addressed.
Theres a movement of previous balance of BTC from my wallet on 2nd August 8.10 UTC
I had been told by support that deposits made after hack will not be effective with losses and will be fully refunded but now its not happening and reason is.....
Bitfinex and zane says hack happened after my deposits at 12.30 UTC. If this is true than why did they moved funds in advance ?
Are they aware of hacking in advance?
Why my balance of 50 Btc left in wallet and not moved to cold storage?
This is pure scam and manipulation. 
Clearly playing with users funds as per their convenience.

hey Zane i totally agree with maks1245 for his argue on deposits made after system shut down. you cannot treat those deposits with prior deposits / holdings as they anyways didn't effected nor reflected in account system while theft.
well i have a query as you said you will be settling open margin orders, so the loss incurred while settlement will also be considered in payoff or not? becoz thats not our fault and loss incurred due to BFX failure.

and what about profits on orders....will that be adjusted against loss or will it be paid off to respective account holder

This 36% is calculated on total deposits or after cutting open orders margin positions in account 
Than what about the losses incurred while position cutting 
Even that you have considered for losses
