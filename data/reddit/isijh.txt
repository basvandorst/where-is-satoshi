The way I see it. If the internet is up. Crypto will be more useful than gold,  more valuable and efficient as means of exchange and a safer asset to own, plus zero storing costs, if the web goes dark for good, gold will be king, then the issue is not how much you have and how much is worth, but if you have enough fire power to keep others from taking it from you.

You're joking right? Stand on the shore of a calm lake or river, he'll even a pond, and you'll see your reflection.

The time to buy is when there's blood on the street. The time to sell is when people are popping champagne.

Bitcoin's supply is capped, so just on that factor alone you're already better holding btc than usd or other fiat currencies. And that's not taking into the other amazing things btc has over central bank currencies, such as real asset ownership, low storage cost, mobility. We're all about bitcoin, but I'd say 3/4 of the population have no idea what bitcoin is , or has even ever heard of it (and i think I'm being overly generous with that number), so from a purely economic analysis the upside potential is still very big. It's on the political front where the hurdles and risk truly lie. Cuz nobody is better at screwing a good thing than politicians.

You have a great indicator there. When that same guy starts buying bitcoin, then you'll know it's time to get out.

Bitcoins only true risk are governments. This volatility is just awesome.

Don't forget to get a trezor or ledger to store them

Bitcoin goes against every single Marxist lie you were taught    at the national university. A sociologist from la nacional wants to advocate for the crown jewel of libertarianism. I have seen it all.

Buy when you start seeing the despair in people's posts. Lowest purchase price is the goal, not buying a bit every month, as price goes up. That's the strategy that will lead to sell in despair when price goes down.

I keep reading the cuck Cuban bubble quote, but I'm pretty sure I read he was getting into cryptos right before last month's peak.

Secular corrections are not crashed. Bull markets are not bubbles. Only people with no knowledge of makes structure interchange those terms.

Can't remember a single web bot prediction that has ever come to pass.

It's .05%. Pretty good deal imo.

A top of bubble headliner usually reads " We're all bitcoiners now " or something along those lines.
@_date: 2017-06-12 14:18:52
It kind of has already, hasn't it?

Is it behind your grasp,, or beyond?

Do some research, and then come back and read your question again.

I'm on the same boat. My guess is they've had a lot of people with pre credited transactions that are now in the red and may be trying to reverse their transactions with their Bank.
