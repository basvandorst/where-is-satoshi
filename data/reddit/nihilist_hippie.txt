I tried that, but when the wallet was created, there were no funds on it, and the address of the wallet was different.  I think I need to choose the right derivation path, but I am not sure what that value would be.  The bitcoins are stored on a bc1 style address, with a smaller amount stored on a legacy style address.
Edit: I found [this page]( which showed me how to access a small sum of coins I had sent to a legacy address, however there are still coins sent to a Segwit address that I cannot seem to successfully import into Electrum.  I'd be interested to see if anyone else has accomplished this!!

Hey guys!  I have a question I am hoping someone can help with.  I have a wallet, Android Bitcoin Wallet.  I saved a backup of the wallet, which is encrypted with a password.  Is it possible to import this wallet into a different Bitcoin client, such as Electrum?  I would like to use a different client without moving funds to different addresses (to avoid transaction fees, I'm dealing with low quantities haha).  Thanks for your consideration!!

Electrum doesn't seem to offer me an opportunity to input a passphrase.  There is a password field right before the wallet is generated, but I thought that was strictly for encrypting the wallet file...  I am able to generate a wallet that has access to some of my coins, but only because the coins are stored in a legacy style address.  The bigger share of my coins are stored on a Segwit address, which I can't seem to access...
