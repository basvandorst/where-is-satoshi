THANK YOU!
Is this linked to from their site? Am I just being a plank and couldn't find it?
@_date: 2018-01-04 11:39:36
Ah yes, I see it at the bottom of the articles now. Thanks again. Request submitted.

Yup, for the 2nd test I used a completely different device.
The preview for the transaction shows the "3" address fine at the point I confirm. It's only when looking at my transaction history I see that it went through as a local transfer and not a sent amount.
I guess I'll need to contact their support then.
Bit annoying as I'd like to move some funds about but now scared to use the service :-/
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:32:18
Hmm. I've just tried the same thing from Coinomi, using a new "3" address from Bitstamp and Coinomi warns it's an "Ambiguous Address".
This could be a Bitstamp problem.
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:01:53
Yup. Already checked. It is valid. Just not had any transfers yet.

Heads-up. Error in Overview: "An instant **Bitcoini** wallet"
@_date: 2014-01-29 21:18:32
I've been trying to do the same thing for mine for months. Every submission is met with silence. Not even a denial email. 
@_date: 2014-01-31 18:50:01
Well, I finally got a response back...
"Having looked at your image in detail I can say this is most likely because of your use of the Bitcoin logo. You are welcome to re-apply but you will need to use a different image which is within our image guidelines"
So. It's official. No Bitcoin on your BastardCard.

Great post/reminder!
Can anyone recommend automation for UK bank accounts? I used to use SpeedyBitcoin when that was a thing; direct purchase via bank transfer to a predefined address. 
Haven't managed to find anything that good since.

I agree. I do trust Ian Colman's site. There is enough use of it in the community, so there's no question there. But I need to understand the process like you say. I can't blindly accept this final step is just OK.
I'm clearly doing something daft here. I'm pasting in the binary value into the string field of that fileformat site, but I still get the SHA256 result beginning with "E".
What step am I missing?
Am I meant to be getting the **hex** value of the binary (basically my original hex entropy entry above) *then* getting the SHA256 value from that?
So: binary &gt; hex &gt; SHA256 ?
That step isn't mentioned in the BIP39 spec. It specifically mentions getting the SHA256 value from the binary entry.
@_date: 2017-06-10 09:09:48
I'm starting to think you're bang on there. Do you know of any online way of doing this correctly then - if not just pasting in the raw binary entropy value?
@_date: 2017-06-09 18:20:09
Can I as how you got that value? I just ran the raw binary entropy through a few generic SHA256 converters online. They all came back with my value.
@_date: 2017-06-10 09:08:48
To name a few. I've been pasting in the raw binary entropy value. I wanted to find a way of doing this all online so I could demonstrate the process manually.
Can I assume then that this is a completely ass-backwards way of getting the SHA256 value?
@_date: 2017-06-10 11:40:13
Ah! So if I was to create entropy from, say, a deck of cards, I'd take the raw binary from that conversion, then convert that to it's hex value, THEN get the SHA256 from that hex. Is that correct?
So it'll always be [entropy] &gt; [raw binary] &gt; [hex value] &gt; [SHA256 hash].
Then the first ENT / 32 binary bits of that hash are what's used for the checksum?
I'll have a play with that this afternoon :-)

Yeah that seems pretty bad. That one, unmentionable, coin appears to have the correct path (when viewed in Coinomi) but it's clearly wrong.
Pumping a Coinomi mnemonic into Ian Coleman's page shows the correct address for said coin. Coinomi has a different receive address ಠ_ಠ
@_date: 2017-06-11 09:33:33
I'm pretty confident with the process now. Thank for the help :-)
But I've just tried restoring a Jaxx wallet into Coinomi with the 12 word mnemonic and the restore has zero funds and different addresses.
This mnemonic stuff is confusing AF.

I'm pasting the binary value into the string field on that site, but just get the incorrect "E" SHA256 value. 
What step am I missing here?
@_date: 2017-06-09 15:20:18
Because it wanted to see if anyone else thought this was an actual issue from people here who might be interested also.
