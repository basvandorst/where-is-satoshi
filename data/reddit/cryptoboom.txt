One big thing lending to bitcoins value is the enormous size of the mining network securing it.  No other coin even comes close.

The 2x crowd like to claim that they have more support than they do.  The person I replied to claimed that Coinbase supports a fork in november and they have said no such thing.  There isn't even a real agreement written down that people agreed to.  The whole thing is scam to manipulate and it is being perpetrated by a handful of people mostly in China.

What is the incentive for the majority of the hash power to abandon the proven track record of core for btc1 and the people backing it?

You're feigning ignorance of the ecosystem while shitting on blockstream who is working on moving us forward.    You literally asked "If blockstream or someone else has a plan, I would love to hear it." knowing full well that bitcoin is decentralized and no one person or group is leading this.  YOU FUCKING KNOW THIS yet you did it anyway.  You are asking for a road map that cannot be produced and you must know that anyone who steps forward and proposes a road map will instantly become a target and accused of trying to take over bitcoin.  Just fucking stop.  This is rbtc bullshit tactics.

Stop grand standing, you know that blockstream is a private company and not the leader of bitcoin or core.  It is not their place to create a scaling roadmap.  They are working within the framework of a decentralized system and doing what they can to further decentralization.
  
it is one thing to keep scaling in the discussion, it is another to use blockstreams satellite offering to grand stand.  This is what the other sub does, stay true, dude.

LN still needs to settle on the network and since it is new you can expect it to not be as efficient as it will be as time goes on.  So expect times where fees are still high in the short term because if LN catches on and has healthy competition in that layer there will be competition for blocks as efficiencies are found.  And if it doesn't catch on everyone will be on btc proper and there will be competition for blocks.  It is going to be interesting to watch for sure!

Bitpay sold out to Bitmain(Chinese Miner) back in May.  So it is really just a chinese miner.  This is important because the chinese miner who is using 2x to attack the community at large will often try and make it look like they have more support from independent entities than they really do.

You're talking out of your ass.  There is no coin with as much backing it as bitcoin, I'm talking the whole ecosystem.  These shitheads with a microphone are trying to convince you that natural market forces like the desire to diversify and seek the next new success is somehow a problem when it isn't.

A hard fork could be necessary to change PoW if it is no longer fulfilling its roll in securing the network.

Miners are signaling NYA right now to get segwit completed.  After segwit is done, miners can signal whatever they want and since we have months until november, you can count on miners dropping the NYA signaling in favor of a conservative path forward.  Most people with a brain will look to the core devs for the solution because they have a solid track record and have earned our trust.  Ignore the FUD, they are just trying to take advantage of the current signaling because they know it won't change for at least the next few days.

This is a big deal.  Coinbase has drawn a line in the sand and stated they will not allow their massive liquidity to be used to attack bitcoin.  So if you want to attack bitcoin and create a fork, you won't get support from them.  I applaud this stance.  They have to really prove themselves and prove there is value in their fork and then maybe Coinbase will add it.  No piggy backing!

You are making a lot of assumptions about Coinbases intentions and not leaving yourself much room for alternative view points.  I am not doing that.  It is a fact that by supporting any fork that comes along, their liquidity can be used to attack one chain or another.  By not immediately supporting a fork, they cannot be used in this manner and instead will follow the market.
@_date: 2017-07-22 18:28:36
It depends on how much loss Ver and Company are willing to absorb to make it appear relevant.  To them it is free money because they control huge amounts of bitcoins which will instantly also be BCC, so they will gamble the shit out it.

What block increase?  There are competing proposals for block increase including segwit.  If you are talking baout segwit, nobody knows because we don't know how side chains will affect fees.

Basically.  But there is wiggle room.  Like I said, BCC is free money for whales to do what they always do which is to pump and dump coins.  So you can expect manipulation.  Lots of it.

Do you think it is unreasonable to wait and see how segwit affects fees and block usage before we decide how big it should be?  I don't think most pro-segwit people are against a block increase, just a rushed one that doesn't account for everything.  I think we can all agree the majority wants segwit and that it is coming.  I think it is irresponsible to ignore that.  Am I wrong?

Care to explain that?  
  
Exchanges are not bitcoin and taking them down does not stop a decentralized coin.  Bitcoin started with zero exchanges and will continue without them.  Taking down exchanges would just push the masses towards decentralized anonymous coins that would only make their lives harder.  It would push developers to make bitcoin anonymous and untraceable.  It would backfire spectacularly.

As long as the complaints are warranted they should keep complaining.  Coinbase showed today that they care more about the the long term health of bitcoin than short term profits and that is encouraging.  Hopefully they will keep adding support people to trim down response times and work on their uptime during critical movements in price.  They are the biggest bitcoin provider on earth so growing pains are to be expected.  I think most people understand that.
@_date: 2017-07-22 16:26:41
If it ends up existing it will be its own coin with no affect on BTC.  People holding BTC will likely dump BCC asap and destroy the market.  There is no code is law to prop this one up, the ideology is centralization and that is counter to what bitcoin stands for.

If there is a fork, there will be an easy way.  You can expect it to happen fast and since the fork is based on bitcoin code, it should be easy for exchanges to support it to some degree.  I seriously doubt any fiat exchange will support it right away.

We've already seen that whales can drive the markets, especially the alt markets.  People like Ver dump millions into any new project simply because it can be used as a tool.  So they are well equipped to slump the alt market while pumping BCC to make it look like everyone is going to BCC when it isn't actually happening.  That is the narrative they will use though.
  
I expect at least one crypto will be mostly unaffected because that is the one they are using to hide their tracks.
@_date: 2017-07-17 21:47:18

That's the point, unless someone buys it, it dies.  So if the house stops buying, then the dumpers dump into each other at market until it is worthless.  So either people like Ver and Wu who are trying to make something out of nothing buy it with their own money or it tanks.  And I think they will buy it, they have worked too hard to let it die, so they will absorb it to a certain point.  That is where the fucking comes in.  I'm sure they are behind the ViaBTC bullshit as an attempt to get ahead of this and lock up peoples money with their promise of free money.

Profiteers will profit from opportunity and opportunity is agnostic.  I don't think you understand what decentralization is because you don't seem to understand that it is why Bitcoin has survived.  People throw millions at projects simply to further decentralization with no guarantee of return.  You can ignore that or embrace it and start to understand why decentralization matters.  It is a part of peoples ideology and ideology can lead to wonderful and terrible things.

I think it is safe to say that the majority of bitcoin transactions are made electronically and not through a physical exchange.  That means that almost all bitcoin transactions are exposed in some way to the many ways in which your identity can be derived through your digital fingerprint.  Unless you are working very hard and doing everything right, you can be found by those at the top of the information heap.
  
Some coins are better at anonymity than others.  Bitcoin is really bad at it.

Well now that you have acknowledged that core did not mislead the miners.  You are wrong if you continue to perpetuate the idea that core agreed to the HK agreement.  You show here that you know who agreed and that they do not represent core.  You cannot hold core as a whole responsible and they did not agree to or back out of an agreement.  I've been around and I know the lies people are willing to tell to get a hard fork and an excuse to split the chain.  The excuse isn't good enough and the people trying to fork are hostile to bitcoin.  They are attacking it.  Stop attacking it.

Coinbase has been warning people to change from 2FA text to a mobile app because 2FA text can be socially engineered.  You could be doing everything right but your cell provider could completely fuck you and they do it regularly.  Which is why coinbase has been warning people to change from 2FA text.

There is no guarantee that a fork will be worth anything.  If you control your own keys, if there is ever a fork, you will control keys on whatever forks are accessible.  That doesn't mean it will have value.

It means jack shit since we don't know who will support it.  The less it is supported, the easier it will be for Ver and Company to manipulate it.
