How long would it take for every BTC user to open a lightning channel? And recharge it every time they need to? How many filled blocks? Oh...

I support Bitcoin and Ethereum. I can say that the Vitalik meme is vastly exaggerated, and while he remains a central figure, by no means is it a one man show. This would be like saying Lukejr or Peter Todd or Gavin Andresen is/was the most important person in Bitcoin. The devs maintaining and developing the Ethereum codebase are in fact dozens across different implementations (geth, parity, trinity, etc...). Also the person writing that tweet should be banned from any intellectually honest conversation due to the reasons already mentioned here. 
@_date: 2018-05-07 16:19:41
Yes, sell everything you own and buy BTC
@_date: 2018-05-30 14:07:57
Don't get confused between Vitalik the meme and Vitalik the developer working with dozens of other developers

@_date: 2019-11-21 07:58:02
Ok, fair enough and thanks for the info. What is the reason why they say hey, we really want people to lose 2% of their fiat capital every year, and we are going to make sure this happens no matter what? Inflation not reaching 2%? No problem, we’ll literally just take your money from you. I don’t get it, is it to make sure people don’t hoard fiat and buy assets instead or build real estate?
@_date: 2019-11-20 22:59:11
That is seriously fucked up. They are doing everything they can to prevent the economy from crashing. How long will this charade keep going? Negative interest rates, are you kidding me? Do they have no shame? On top of the normal 2% inflation? And the insane amount of taxes we have to pay already?

I know it’s bad to debate fanatics, but I’ll still shoot my load. I mean other cryptoeconomic networks (other than Bitcoin) that allow for virtually free transactions. Sorry if this is upsetting you

Not a pre-mine

Oh so it's not that you weren't aware of that specific term, you just dunked on me for not having native-level English. That was the point of your remark.
@_date: 2019-10-30 12:30:41
Well said!
@_date: 2019-10-30 12:30:27
Unlike your opinion leaders, I don't claim to have all the answers. What I do know is that as it is, BTC + Lightning network is not going to solve any large scale problems.
@_date: 2018-06-10 18:04:01
\&gt;There's lower liquidity for anything else
Bad excuse. There's more than enough liquidity for the kind of volume we are seeing. If every citizen of venezuela spent ALL his $1 monthly wage in crypto, it would amount to around $30 mil. of monthly demand. Hardly a drop in the markets.
\&gt;Since they're using a few days of work not to lose last weeks' work, it might be worthwhile.
Sure, but why not waste those few days of work at all
\&gt;But you're the boring person complaining, they want to use, that's all.
I'm sorry, are you autistic?
@_date: 2019-10-30 10:05:39
You need to start practicing yoga and meditation. Eat healthy food. This will be the cognitive foundation for you to leave the blockstream maximalist cult. Good luck
@_date: 2019-10-30 12:45:41
Could you give an estimate of what is the frequency of lightning network use per day per company? You claim it is used by "thousands of businesses", so you must have some kind of ballpark figure available, right?
@_date: 2018-06-07 19:07:26
Ethereum wasn't "pre\-mined"

Lol, you think Zuck will allow capital flight from his beloved mouse trap to freedom? He needs to click his fingers and deplatform all the exchanges. Done.
@_date: 2019-10-30 13:00:46
My answer is in the form of homework. How many transactions would it take to open a lightning channel account for every person on Earth. You have 10 minutes to answer this question.

That’s a bullshit meme often echoed around the neckbeard circles of Reddit. When I close my eyes, I can see your smug satisfied faces as you spout out these catchphrases like “correlation is not causation” and al the greatest hits. There are definitely people with a talent for interpreting complex ideas into simple terms, but not being able to ELI5 how to make your mom come doesn’t mean I can’t. She’s just difficult you know?

Actually. Assange was one of the original cypherpunks. He most likely had direct communication with whoever Satoshi is. In fact, Satoshi’s last post talks about Wikileaks. Your petulant ignorance is showing.

You are speaking in hyperboles, slandering and defaming the same organisation you have been called to lead. We can only be thankful the board members are trying to set the record straight.
Bankruptcy is a legal term that is not applicable here, if you wanted to say the Foundation had little money left, then you should have said just that.
90% is a mathematical term, if 90% didn't quit, then you should have either said "a lot" or quoted the actual figure.
I believe your intentions are pure but you have been communicating like a complete amateur. You needs to get your game straight. How do you think the media will report on this? "Hero anarchystar defeats Foundation sharks" or "Bitcoin CEO destroys own company"?

That's because people don't understand Bitcoin. Coinbase has to be super paranoid about KYC/AML stuff because Bitcoin transactions are irreversible. They should be commended for having a sensitive trigger. The other option would be people complaining all the time about their money getting stolen.

I visit Gab from time to time. Just a question, purely in terms of the content on there, what exactly is being said on that platform that is worth being expressed? You would think that you would use free speech to advance grounbreaking ideas, radical philosophy, something/anything interesting? It seems like “free speech” in this case is more of an excuse to act like a twat? Like bro I’m not really an asshole this is just a SOCIAL EXPERIMENT dude
