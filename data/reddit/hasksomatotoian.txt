Ok, now it makes sense to me, thanks for the explanation. Need to say, that this information makes this already very exciting story even more interesting...

Technically yes, but I don't think it will happen. It's more likely that they agree that they WON'T increase the block size. But I still think, that the split is the most probable scenario.

Hold on, BitMain would be more than happy if they could sell new asics to all mining pools, so from this perspective, having SegWit activated is in BitMain interest, isn't it? On contrary, miners would need to spend a lot of money on new asics, so why more than 90% of them is signalling support for SegWit2x? Do you think the New York Agreement has a secret part like "Let's signal support for SegWit2 so that we destroy BIP 148 and then let's just increase the block size"?

The main worry is not about Segwit, I also agree that it will be probably smooth, because it's backward compatible change. The main worry is about the increase of the block size to 2MB which is going to be activated by Segwit2x at the end of the year. After that, Bitcoin splits into 2 currencies. The question now is, is this just minor bump on the road or is this an apocalypse?

Thanks, I found these [meeting notes from Core meeting]( which confirms what you said. It nicely describes arguments of both sides.

Ok, you are right, thanks for correction. So, who is actually pushing BIP 148? I noticed that is one of most vocal advocates and he is one of Core devs, isn't he? Does he represent just some part of Core devs here?

I'm quite new into Bitcoin and I'm still learning this ecosystem, so sorry if this is completely wrong, but here is my understanding of this situation:
* It's a battle between miners on one side and Bitcoin Core community on the other side.
* Bitcoin Core community thinks that miners are trying to start controlling Bitcoin through SegWit2x / BIP 91 / BTC1 client and they try to stop them. This is not technical but rather ideological dispute, so there are no prisoners in this war.
* The likelihood that changes for BTC1 client will be merged into Bitcoin Core client are virtually zero.
* The SegWit2x is currently supported by [86.11% of hash power]( so it's almost for sure that miners will win the first round and SegWit will be activated through BTC1 client on July 25th.
* As a response, Bitcoin Core community will very likely activate a hard-fork to change the proof-of-work algorithm on August 15th. **EDIT** As I was corrected below, this initiative is actually not from Core, but from UASF / BIP 148 group
* Even if Bitcoin Core community doesn't do it, miners will activate hard-fork to change base block size sometime in November.
It seems to me, that sooner or later, the hard fork is inevitable. Am I missing something, did I simplify it too much?

This looks like a good supporting argument for what you say. BitMain really doesn't give up:

This is interesting - numbers on the [uasf.saltylemon.org]( are different from what you can see on [coin.dance/nodes/uasf]( The difference is probably caused by different metric definition. This is the one used by Coin Dance:


As numbers on Coin Dance are pretty flat, I'm afraid it means that the number of individuals supporting UASF is more or less constant last few months. They are just putting more and more nodes on the network. I suppose the number of nodes is more important, so numbers on [uasf.saltylemon.org]( are more relevant. I just don't think, that they indicate increasing UASF support among users.

See the chapter "August 15: Potential BIP148 Proof-of-Work Change" in the referenced article. Accoding to the article, this option is discussed on the "Bitcoin Core Community" Slack, but it's probably not supported by majority of Core devs.

There is this paragraph in the article:


I read again [Bitmain announcement]( and there is this:


As I understand it, Bitmain clearly says: "If BIP148 activates, we don't care about SegWit2x and we are going to hard fork with Bitcoin ABC"
