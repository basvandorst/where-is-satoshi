Where did you get this information 'Bitstamp is also seeing discrepancies'?
@_date: 2014-02-11 18:34:06
Good stuff. Stranex and co doing some excellent work.

A time for buying comes.

0. Got out of Gox in October. The writing was all over the place.

I'll take your spot up here on the pine.

If it walks like a duck...

Why would you be actively against something that has no bearing on you?
@_date: 2014-02-11 19:46:59
Noting that the CEO of Gox is the owner of that Wiki.

1) I'm not out of the country logging in from a different IP. I'm elsewhere in the country and if you knew anything about IP's you'd know they're mostly dynamically allocated. 
2) I'm 2FA authenticated and logging in to post messages to support.
3) I clearly stated I've supported Bitstamp on here and elsewhere through the Gox saga and their service provider issues
4) I asked them if this was an ongoing requirement i.e. are they going to request this continually and if so do a visual check against my photograph on file
5) Get fucked.

A DM is a PM?

Exchange to trade only then get out.
@_date: 2013-12-17 14:26:31
Yep. BitX has never given me any issues.
@_date: 2013-12-17 15:49:24
DM me? Dungeon Master FTW.

You'll piss the wrong people off.

Agreed with riplin. It's not that easy. Simply put. You sell at say $500 and go short on a trend and bitcoin turns and goes higher then your last sell price i.e. $500. Now you won't be able to buy back in until the price is &lt; $500. Which may be never. So you need a stop-loss in place. 
And this doesn't even include the trading fee.
But you will learn about trading. So come and get burned.
