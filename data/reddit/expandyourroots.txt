BTC is tied to USD if USD stocks go down, BTC will go up...

As a trader, I cringe on why you keep your savings in a broker account.
This is the  rule in the traders book. Remove your profits and keep your vested amount. Otherwise, you will get fucked in the end,

Hey, could you make this in a higher quality so I can post it on my news site? I would really like to push out how un-organized News Week is and destroy them as a competitor. :)
@_date: 2014-03-07 14:17:36
I believe it is news weeks address, in which is publically allowed to be shown. 
Anyways, that being said. I am literally sending out 10 pizza's there. and paying for them. Those assholes

@_date: 2017-02-05 16:55:30
I bet you wasted $100 on stupid shit though during your teens, we all did haha.
I was fortunate and grew up with a Traders family. So when it came to making that choice I had support :p

"I'm pretty sure I was the first person in history to have the official title "cryptocurrency engineer"."
No. LOL. You were not. This title has been given / bought into since 2013. 
Plus... Satoshi is the real engineer behind crypto..so...GL with it all
@_date: 2017-02-06 03:37:28
Agreed. I was just busting some chops :) I forget about the student loan crisis in the US

I personally trade 400x - 800x on forex. 
It's very easy with strong stop losses and heavy studying in that market.
Also, I've blown through accounts like no tomorrow too lol
@_date: 2015-01-22 17:50:27
Yeah, anything that was tied to the swiss most CFD brokers turned off high leverage due to the risks of markets moving to quickly. My broker today disabled the EURO markets cause of the ECB announcement which moved very quickly as I recall.
With leverage, you are definitely at a high risk, especially the way I use mine. It's all about the money management system you come with, and risk management. 
@_date: 2015-01-22 18:14:14
You should look into it. Keep in mind it's not a game to play without a strong understanding. I can't stress enough that risk/money management strategies are the best in this instance.
My favorite quote... that I can't recall but in context is this
"Investing is only fun when you are losing. The second you start becoming successful with your trades, it becomes boring" 
Which is very true. 
@_date: 2014-10-19 06:03:03
so you just spam? lol.

I've done all this too pretty easily without bitcoin. I do use bitcoin regularly but I come from a trading background. 
I also enjoy the fact that currency trading (forex) is like risk. so much to account for.
@_date: 2015-02-24 01:27:48
Yeah, that happens when you meet traders on the internet. 
It's simple, but it takes practice. It doesn't happen in 1 year. Surely not in 2... but maybe by your 4th to 5th year after just breaking even... you might break into a profit zone, just like gamblers or even poker players. You always here the wins, but never the losses or how much.
In the end though, we're all the same and we only want to find the future, not the current. If you can predict a direction with a logical stop on it, you're golden.

It's hilarious to see this community thinking how useless TA is in trading.
Maybe to Bitcoin since the market is VERY small with users vs. traders...
TA is very useful but lots of people think you just trade with TA... no, no you fucking don't. TA is only 10-20% of a trading possibility. Fundamentals is where it goes, and analyzing what the fundamentals will do to said technical analysis... 
that's my 2 satoshi's on that matter.
@_date: 2016-07-29 16:48:39
ha.. you said Anal
