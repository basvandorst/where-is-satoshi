This all makes sense i just dont understand why is called miners fee and how a miner gets it... 
@_date: 2013-11-08 14:00:46
Explain why?

Could you explain why you would have 50k in bitcoins?

Okay I'm sorry but none of this makes any sense to me. You send a payment with no one as a recipient for the change. Does the change default to some address. Why would a random miner get random change in the chain? I'm sorry if I'm being dying.

Okay a miner gets the 25 coins for finding a block but why does he get the change from my poor transaction?

Hi i have heard about bitcoin forever but never really started getting into it until now. I bought a block erupter for fun last week though i think it's gonna be pretty much pointless. I have never used the tipbot but i am excited to try. People on commenting saying they don't trust this but i don't see why is untrustworthy, anyone? For a wallet i am currently using the one on my android but i have multibit installed on my pc, i don't use it every though. I really wish i would have taken more interest in bitcoin before it cost so much! I'm doing what i can now though. Because people have brought up trust issues can i PM my address?
