I asked the Bitcoin Reddit about a good wallet that is secure and anonymous and a user suggested it.

Is it a scam after all?
@_date: 2016-06-10 23:10:21
Is there anything I can ro

I have the same problem exactly. It denies everything and when I click on settings i get this message. "We need to check a few things.
We need to take some additional time to review your account before you can update your account information. We're sorry for the delay. You will receive an email from Circle when your account is ready. This process typically takes 3-5 business days."

But circle is a wallet... On that line then still what is a good anonymous wallet I don't need to buy Bitcoin there but I would like to know a good wallet and I will use exchanges to put money in the wallet, I would like to find a solid, anonymous, good interface wallet. Thanks

Yah that's what I'm doin. Cash deposits or I can buy a Amazon gift card and exchange that with people.

How long did it take for them to email you and long did it take for the refund to go to your account.

But if you lose that paper, you're literally screwed right?

Omg I looked at yours and when it said you had already earned 2 mbtc I thought it said btc and was like oh shit that's a ton of money hahaha

If each bitcoin is named or in someway differentiated from another, the entire let's say "cikmunith" of bitcoins are less secure. If it is easier tontrack, then it becomes a security issue, and security was one of the main reasons of the creation of bitcoins.
