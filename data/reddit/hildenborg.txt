I assumed that Data have a general purpose processor. If we talk about specialized hardware, then the operations are specifically designed for their purpose. There is no upper limit for how much work that could be done in a single specialized operation. A specialized operation could even be a complete hash algorithm (but this would not be a good idea from various reasons). So if Data had a specialized bitcoin operation, he could pretty much do 60Thashes.

I'm one of the affected, and I am starting to concider my 11.62BTC lost... I hope I'm wrong, but I do see some strange data from MtGox. Look at the graphs here: [TheGoxReport](  
Look at the weekly failed TX, and then look at the weekly value sum of all failed TX.  
While the sum of all failed TX started to decrease on Thursday, the sum of failed bitcoins didn't...  
I might be paranoid, but it seems to me that MtGox is prioritising the failed TX containing just a few BTC of value. If they had successfully reissued TX containing large amounts of BTC, then the weekly sum would have dropped too in the same way the failed TX sum drops off.  
So why would they prioritize the small amounts before the large?

Something that *could* have been done with the system MtGox had, was to withdraw BTC from MtGox, and listen for the TX to appear on the blockchain. When you see the TX, you alter it using malleability, and post it to the blockchain again. This second post is best made to another mining pool. If you are lucky, then the altered TX will be the one who wins over the first one. In any case, the BTC will get transferred to your address. But if your hack succeeds, it will mean that MtGox previously bugged system did not detect that the transaction had been done.  
So, why does it matter if the system automatically tries to do the transaction again or not?  
Well, the next time the system automatically tres to resend the BTC, then you just try and do the hack again... You could have a fully automated system for this too. You just let your computer continue to drain BTC from MtGox that happily continues to resend the transaction.  
So, when would MtGox find out if this have happened?  
Well, their database have obviously been depending on the TX that it shouldn't have had. So what MtGox is doing right now, is to reindex their database from going through the blockchain and finding out what outputs that have been spent.  
This will take time to do, but I would expect it to be done by now or very soon.  
And then they will know for the first time since this started, exactly how many BTC they actually have, and if any have been stolen.  
This is something they simply do not know until the database have been reindexed.

Not as easy as it may sound. You would need a list of all their wallets first. And that list is most likely a MtGox secret.

Basically, the only ones that will be negatively hit by this, are the ones who mines bitcoins in Sweden.  
As they are creating assets, they will have to add VAT (25%) to the coins when they sell them. And also pay normal income tax (~30%) for the money they make.  
Bying and selling bitcoins will have a capital gains tax (30%) on the gain you make. Which also means that you could declare loss (70% of the 30% lossed).  
So the tax is same for using bitcoins as for using dollars, except for that you can't mine dollars.

I hate to say this, but you really have double bad luck, or maybe hopefully just luck...  
This is what happens just now:  
Due to some issue at MtGox, some transactions fails, and have been doing that since the weekend. I know, I have 11.62BTC lost in transaction right now.  
And, I can prove that your BTC is currently in a failed transaction, just go to [this link]( And on the second listed transaction, click on "Raw transaction (decoded)", and you can find the address and the bitcoin sum.  
This means that your stolen bitcoins have not reached the thiefs account, and that's good.  
So basically, if you are lucky you could in theory get in contact with MtGox and ask them to not resend this transaction whenever they fix the current transaction problem issues.  
The bad part is that ther is a growing number of people with this very same problem, and none of us have managed to get in contact with MtGox. This is all starting to become a bit strange...  
And more and more failed transactions are pouring in. At the time of writing it is up to 1649, and you can check it yourself at: [  
I really hope it all sorts out for you, but you are indeed unlucky to have gotten your bitcoins stolen and then trapped in some MtGox strangeness.

No. Signing a transaction cannot be done in the traditional way as it would require a central authority that held the root certificate making it possible to sign a transaction in such way that it couldn't be modified.  
This problem was solved in the Bitcoin protocol by proof of work. And a correctly signed transaction is one that have survived in the block chain after having it's proof of work verified by at least six miners.  
When these six verifications have been done, *then* the TX id can be used. Using it before that is not recomended.  
So, MtGox having used the TX id before six verifications is a bug. The hash itself is not a bug.  
If you could invent a decentralized way of signing transactions without proof of work, then you have succeeded with something that have been unsolved for a long time...

As MtGox changed their output syntax for the api call that [thegoxreport.com]( used for getting their data, we can no longer get the sum of failed BTC outputs (I am sure it is just a coincidence...).  So I wrote a small python script that will print out that. Here it is for anyone interested:  
  
    import urllib2

    print "Failed TX count: " + str(len(list(goxFails['result']))) + ", output sum: " + str(sumOut)  +"

Whoever buys that large amount of bitcoins surely does it for investment purposes, and not for immediate spending purposes.  
This is an opportunity for larger investors that want to get into the game now, but cannot buy that many bitcoins on the market without making a huge movement.  
So, my thought is that there will be a pretty tough bidding on the auction. And it will probably get very close to, or even higher than the current bitcoin price. Because, if the same investors wanted to buy that amount of bitcoins on the market, they would have to pay so much more because of the shallow order depth.  
In other words, I think larger investors will buy, and they are most likely willing to pay a small percentage more than the current bitcoin price.  
If that happens, then I am quite sure that the following days price trend will be interesting.

Imagine me wanting to give you seven dollars, but I only have a ten dollar bill. It all works out though, because you have three dollars, so I give you the ten dollar bill and get three dollars back.  
If this would have been a bitcoin transaction, the input would have been the ten dollar bill, and there would be two outputs: three and seven dollar.  
A bitcoin transaction do not neccessarily tell us what if any of the outputs that is the returned change. So it is not feasible to calculate how much bitcoins that MtGox is trying to send, but we can calculate how many bitcoins that are involved.

The sell and buy process are exactly the same.  
You either borrow btc, or you borrow dollars.  
If you borrow btc, then to make any money you have to sell them and then buy back when the price is lower, otherwise you will loose money.

That just feels like a bad lie. MtGox are currently having huge issues with paying out money to anyone, even in BTC. There are since almost two weeks back an increasing problem with failed BTC transactions from MtGox, and everything points to them being out of cash.  
There are currently 2129 failed BTC transactions from MtGox, and it is increasing fast. Go see here: [skanner.net](  
I think this latest lie is just a desperate move from their side to hide the fact that they haven't got the clients coins anymore.  
EDIT:  
And how about that, suddenly MtGox changed the json output format of the api call: [api/0/bitcoin_tx]( so that the skanner.net page seems to fail showing the count... The previous output format delivered the transaction in raw form in aproperty called "tx", and now they send it in decoded form in a property called "tx_p". A small modification, but why now?  
EDIT2:  
Skanner.net seems to have updated its code now. Apparently, MtGox have just now reverted a lot of failed transactions, and the BTC's are in peoples accounts again. I immediately tried to send mine, and it seems to have failed again...

OK, question time.  
  
Why didn't you stop withdrawals immediately when the bug was discovered?  
Why have you made alterations to the [bitcoin_tx]( API call output syntax?  
  
Regarding the output syntax, the first change was to change the "tx" property that contained the raw transaction into "tx_p" containing a decoded transaction with limited information.  
The second change was to change the "addr" property in the outputs from base58 encoded to hex format.  
The first change broke the sites [skanner.net]( and [thegoxreport]( and [skanner.net]( was fast to adapt to the syntax change, but have apparently now been taken down as there have been yet another alteration.  
As this API call is the only help people have had to find out what happens to their transactions, why do you make changes to it right now when you could better spend development time on finding the actual bug?  
The guys at [coinsight.org]( still seems at it by updating their code, so we at least can see some information.  
  
The bug itself:  
It can easily be seen in the API call [bitcoin_tx]( output that several transactions are trying to use the same input.  
For example, transactions 0008feb881f2ebebb11f57a03225d760747560327fddfc1ab8fd80213461113b and 11782c5ce048ba226f55c95e57335ff5b67ff71eda30007a82fbe82b5f5b3246 among several others uses the same input: output index 1 from tx e5d4fb29777bbfe0b00363b5a2eaac100dd0b95fc57445740ac899053571c070.  
(This information might not be available anymore as transactions are being reverted into customers accounts.)  
If a input is used in one TX, then it shouldn't be used in another, or it will be treated as a double spending.  
This to me seems like an extremely fundamental flaw in your software/database solution of it cannot keep track of this very basic form of bitcoin protocol.  
And I would like to hear from you what possible explaination your developers could have for that kind of bug.

I had a quick look at the original bitcoin code, and compared it to Wei Dai's Crypto++ code, and I do not think the original bitcoin code was written by Wei Dai.  
Reasoning:  
  
In the original bitcoin code, the sources and headers are placed in a "src" subfolder. In Crypto++, they are put in the project root folder.  
  
Wei Dai puts the pointer asterix before the variable name, and in the bitcoin code it is after the type. Ex.:  
Bitcoin code: const CBlock* pblock  
Wei Dai: byte *target  
  
In the bitcoin code, class names always begin with "C", which they are not in Wei Dai's code. Ex.:  
Bitcoin code: class CKey  
Wei Dai: class ByteQueueNode  
  
So, these three things are typically the kind of things that developers tend to have as a signature to his or hers personal style.

No, it is not a backdoor. A backdoor is when someone purposedly have created a hidden entry point to get access to normally blocked parts of the system.  
Malleability is a known effect on the hashing of TX id's.  
It is not hidden. It has not purposedly been created to get access to anyones bitcoins. It is not a backdoor.  
  
In fact, MtGox inabillity to handle malleability, plus the fact that they used TX id's and not spent outputs, together with their automatic reissue of "failed" transactions, guranteed that they in some cases would double or triple send BTC to customers who did withdrawal.  
So, customers who got double or triple the amount they wanted to withdraw, did they do wrong not reporting it back to MtGox?  
I think MtGox have shown a good example of security neglect in all this, and I hope that they have at least the greater part of their BTC left.

Also, the transaction sizes that would fail if the hot wallet ran out, would still be a lot larger than the single digit or less transactions that fail now.  
And if it was a hot/cold wallet problem, then they have had ten days to move 11.16BTC from their cold wallet to hot wallet to fix my transaction...

About trading volumes:  
  
* They vary like they do for any stock or monetary trade.  
* The current price trend is quite stable so it leaves little space for speculation - which lowers volume. We will always see a higher trading volume when the price is highly volatile.  
* There are at least two bitcoin ETF funds starting up, and they both have said that they do not buy their bitcoins on the open market. Instead they approach the miners directly. This means that there are a lot of coins that we never see the volume of.  
* Do not confuse trading volume with transaction volume. Trading volume means that bitcoin is traded for dollars. Transaction volume tells us how bitcoin is actually used within the bitcoin eco system.

The code for the card could be open sourced.  
I have actually spent some time lately thinking about this, and how all the technology already exists. There are smart card terminals cheap enough, and there are cheap programmable smart cards that can handle signing of bitcoin transactions.  
Many of the things needed have been available for years through the cable and satellite hacking community.  
I guess the OpenPGP card could be a great base for a open sourced bitcoin card.  
A likely solution would be to have the TX signed internally on the card after the user had entered his pin code via a separate keypad terminal.  
I think such a terminal costs about $20, and the smart card around the same or less.

The thing is that if MtGox becomes insolvent, it will mean that everyone still having cash or coins at MtGox will loose a lot of money. Why would this affect the price on bitcoins for any other exchange?  
The only possible reason would be if there is a panic among bitcoin owners, and they start to sell their coins, but I cannot see the connection of MtGox customers loosing money, and other exchange customers panicing...  
Perhaps that there would be a period of wait and see, where the price will be steady when everyone tries to figure out what happened. And after a while everything will return to normal.

I don't think any bitcoin trading site is vulnerable to this hack. The flaw they use is the option of having the 2FA pin sent to the users phone, and that is not something that any bitcoin site do.

It doesn't feel realistic... From what we saw on the failed transactions, we are talking about tens of thousands of coins missing in that case. Even if the price dropped to a few hundred dollars per coin, it would still mean millions of dollars of cash needed to buy all those coins. I doubt that MtGox have that kind of cash since their dwolla account got confiscated.  
And where would they buy all those coins without making a huge market move?  
So, I don't think this is some elaborate plan from MtGox to fix up their mess. I think their problem is much simpler: they are just stupid and arrogant.

I don't think they are dishonest in that way. But they do need to pay their daily expenses. And what would you do if the profits from the trade volume wasn't enough to pay your bills? Perhaps use a bit of the clients money until things are better? I mean, it is just numbers in a database until they want to withdraw it, right?  
Then shit starts to happen when more and more people want to withdraw...  
Just pure speculation, but I'm not seing anything that makes me belive anything other.  
Just look at what happened at around 23:00 Japanese time, when they obviously tried to resend all failed transactions. By now it seems like pretty much all of the transactions failed again, and the volume of BTC in those transactions is even larger now ~36000BTC...  
I do not belive that transactions with large numbers of inputs/outputs have a higher risk of failing, as there are lots of failed transactions with just one or two inputs/outputs that fails.  
I am starting to belive that they indeed are out of coins.

Some of them probably are. There is probably a reason why Bitstamp, BTC-E and Huobi have almost have the same price. The reason (pure speculation) is most likely from the fact that if it differs too much, then it is possible for someone to buy at one site, transfer bitcoins to another and sell there to transfer the money back to the cheaper site.  
However, buying and selling in this way will quite quickly make the price difference close up.  
The reason MtGox could have such a different price is then likely becuase of tranaction problems. You can but cheap at bitstamp, and sell high at MtGox, but good luch transferring that money back to bitstamp.  
So, in this case, MtGox have been a kind of isolated island, and hopefully this will also be the reason for why it wont affect other exchanges too much.  
But then again, don't take my speculation for a fact.

No there are no similarities. To better understand the price of gold, read this: [understanding-paper-versus-physical-gold](  
You have to understand how central banks in the world have an interest of keeping the gold price low, to hide the fact that they are printing money. So they have this nice way of creating new gold by just having it in paper form. So the price on physical gold is pretty much controlled by creating more gold that only exists on paper.  
There are some indications that there may be as much as 100 times more gold in paper form than in physical form. And some belive that there can be a huge crash in gold the day that too many owning paper gold want to have it delivered in physical form.  
The day when the total number of owned bitcoins exceed the number of mined bitcoins will be the day when we can start to compare bitcoins with gold.

This means that the unique part of the address is 160 bits, which equals to 1,4615016373309029182036848327163e+48 addresses.  
In other words: a fucklot!

As others have pointed out: sha256 is not an encryption, it is hashing. And a big difference (among many) is that when you calculate a hash, there is no intention of ever getting the original data back. While encryption always keeps the entire data set (although scrambled). So hashing is by design harder to crack than encryption, as you simply do not know anything about the original dataset.

To describe it another way:  
So, there are 1,461,501,637,330,902,918,203,684,832,716,283,019,655,932,542,976 addresses.  
And according to [this]( calculation, there are 7,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 grains of sand in the whole world.  
So rounded off, we can assign 200,000,000,000,000,000,000 addresses to each corn of sand in the world.

I have both bitcoins and gold. But if I was to invest in survival, I would buy cans of food instead.

Download the latest driver for your graphics card. If you still don't have OpenCL, then your graphics card is probably too old...  
An advice on mining though:  
Unless you have free electricity, then there is no way to make any money on CPU/GPU mining. The difficulty level is simply too high today.  
Better spend the money on buying bitcoins instead.

Something that I have thought about for a while, is how we could make it harder for someone to pump and dump bitcoin.
There was a quite likely pump and dump in february, and I am convinced that the crazy market from Sunday and to the drop, was all part of yet another pump and dump.
I just followed the orders live, but someone with access to trade history could probably show it better: there was a *lot* of small orders that was all intended just to pump up the value before the dump. And after the dump, fear followed...
So how can this be stopped?
Well, should trading markets really accept someone to place hundreds of orders to buy/sell 0.01 bitcoins instead of just one larger order?
How about having a minimal trading fee instead of a flat percentage?
I am sure that there are several ways to make it harder for some rich and greedy person to control the market and then crash it.

To try and break an encryption is not the same as wanting to use it for evil purposes.  
A lot of white hat hackers spend all their days trying to crack encryptions, just to spread the information about how to make them more secure.  
There have been a lot of bad talk about NSA lately... If they deserve the bad talk, or if it should be directed at the polititians ordering NSA to do what they do... That I leave for others to decide.  
But the fact is that NSA have helped developing encryptions before, and not doing evil stuff with it: [

It is important to be cautius. With technologies like this, when the future is so unknown, any bet is a risk.  
I took a hit myself during the dotcom bubble... I lost about 350K over night, ending up having absolutely zero.  
My investments in Bitcoin will never exceed what I can afford to lose. And I will only make investments that I understand.

Well, I did end my post with saying that I don't know exactly what is happening. For who does? It is all just speculation until we are proven right or wrong, and even then it could just be out of pure luck from a lucky guess.  
So no, I cannot do any more analysis on this than stating that I do think it follows the curve of a bubble.  
However, I do dare to state this: If we indeed are at the position in the bubble curve as I belive we are, then the there will be another large dip within the next 12 hours. If that doesn't happen, then I was wrong about the bubble and will buy in again.  
EDIT:  
The price does not behave as I expected it to do, if we were at the position in the bubble chart that I speculated about.  
So I went all in again.

So, what if the FBI got hold on all of his copies of the wallet, and it isn't a brainwallet...  
Doesn't that mean that neither they or him will ever get hold of the bitcoins?  
In other words, this could mean that 600K of bitcoins have become unusuable.  
5% of all bitcoins may suddenly have become lost.

This is the funny part: If I would tell you why I think it is going down, then I would get downvoted by a lot of people. Why? Because there are so many bitcoin owners in this subreddit that have invested in bitcoin without doing even the tiniest bit of research. They just want and needs it to go up. It is almost like a religion...  
If they had looked at the history of bitcoin, then it would become apparent that bitcoin sometimes gets overbought and ends up in what some people call a bubble.  
Do some readup on the following link: [  
And then go to any of the sites you use for checking the current bitcoin trend and see how the curve since a month back almost perfectly matches the chart on the site.  
If I were to guess, I would say that we are probably in somewhere between "Back to normal" and starting to enter into "Fear".  
But then again, I could be completely wrong. The truth is that nobody knows what is happening. Even if we are at the beginning of a bubble collapse, it may mean nothing. The amount of media attention bitcoin gets right now may cause a lot of people to invest into bitcoin and thus nullifying the bubble if it ever was one.  
So basically, I don't know, but I am watching it close and adjusting my own investments after what happens.

I do belive in bitcoin. For real.  
I bught my first coins in January, and I will stay with bitcoin no matter what happens.  
I do however like to try my chances of selling and buying more when the opportunities seems to be in my favor.  
Sometimes I succeed, and sometimes I fail... I lost 38 bitcoins in April from panik selling. After that did my research.  
One thing I decided upon was: never ever sell or buy in panik. Think it through and base it on logic. Otherwise just hold.
