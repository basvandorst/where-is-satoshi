in February of this year i had almost 700 grand because i bet my life savings on AMD options and made over 300% in gains. unfortunately, i didnt sell and through a series of bad bets my brokerage account fell under 25 grand today. 
I'm devastated and numb, it has been slow downward spiral since February. The last 10 years of my life i worked and saved all that money. i didnt do shit. i lived cheaply and didnt go anywhere and was single all that time.
well, life goes on. im not going to kill myself. what that money could have done for my future family will haunt me forever. i think my situation is much worse than your brothers. i actually had a shitload of money. it was mine, i endured extreme stress for over a year to make those gains and i just threw it all away.
your brother was depressed and mentally ill.

if he was so bullish on btc why wouldn't he have loaded up when it was cheap?

I actually spent like everyday obsessing over amd, learning everything about the company and new developments. I thought their new server chip would actually have sales this year but it turns out the whole thing is a myth. The fucking thing doesn't even exist as far as the market is concerned. Next year could be different, but I won't be a part of it.

Get a tax accountant, and put some of that in fiat. Buy a house or three. Rent them out. Never worry about money again.

or it becomes a sell the news event because it seems like everyone expects it. this is my experience dealing with binary events in the stock market. probably doesn't apply here.

@_date: 2017-07-21 03:33:16

@_date: 2017-07-20 18:47:09

@_date: 2017-07-20 23:01:46
