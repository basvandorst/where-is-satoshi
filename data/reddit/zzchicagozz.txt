HEY it got posted ANOTHER time. I'm counting more than a dozen times now. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:15:34
Wishful thinking, but I hope you're right.

Crashing, down to 16,500
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:52:34
I bought when it was at an all time high at 9k. Look at me now. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:38:47
It did not sadly lol. The highest price I'm seeing was 19,340 and I had my limit set closer to 19700. Hopefully bounces back so I can sell off

It's extremely unlikely that it's going to explode up 1000% or even 100% in the very short term. 
If you're looking to turn that $50 into $500 for Christmas, don't count on it. 
If you want to gamble a bit with $50 and hopefully turn it into $75 or something, then go ahead. 
Wait for a dip, and spend an amount you don't mind losing.

Coinbase is probably just down from traffic lol
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:29:08
Aaand it's back? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:26:13
Damnit Bitcoin, go the other way. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:25:42
Could be an hour, could be a month, could be never. 
Nobody here knows for sure what the price is going to do. If you can't afford to lose what you sank in, just hold tight, do your best to hold until it reaches 19k, and then sell it. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:26:18
Nothing. People here just like to act like they know what's going to happen when in reality, nobody knows for sure.

I got in for about $1k when the price was 9,800. My plan is to wait until I've doubled my money and cash out. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:30:01
ON THE WAY BACK UP BOIS
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:24:07
Is this unprecedented? How long should we expect it to be down? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:48:28
I'm not going to tell you you're wrong, and I certainly hope you're right. But lets not pretend you have any more of an idea what is about to happen than the rest of us. 
I have one little secret to investing in bitcoin that can help you all, and it's legitimate. 
NOBODY KNOWS WHAT IS ABOUT TO HAPPEN. And anybody that thinks they DO know what is about to happen is gonna be first in line to lose big. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:33:19
Already did my friend ;) 
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:02:52
Yup, unless the economy of western nations hits a recession (like many experts are expecting to happen) and a lot of the market decides they need liquid cash and not bitcoin, and sells off. 
I fully expect bitcoin to dip back down to early 2017 levels before the end of 2018, but I think it's going to shoot up more before that happens. 
Then again, take everything I say with a grain of salt, because I don't know shit and nobody else here does either. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:13:20
25k today and I'll eat your center banana. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:51:39
Oof, lesson learned there, don't buy when it's on a huge spike. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:43:32
"I've been following bitcoin for a week, all you people who have been into it for years, let me tell you what's about to happen"
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:00:20
Hey man, that's a nice bitcoin you've got there.
