Let me read to you a few verses from the book of MatthewCoin, chapter 28, so that you may see and believe:
*18- Then Satoshi came to them and said "All authority on the Blockchain and on the internet has been given to crypto and the network".*
*19- Therefore, go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of Satoshi, the White Paper, and the Holy Blockchain*
*20- And teaching them to obey the BTC protocol. And surely I am with you always, to the very end of the age*
Seek the truth my child

Verily, Satoshi our prophet has promised us salvation
I will read to you a few verses from the book of the Genesis Block, chapter 1, so that you may see and believe. Verily, it is all written.
*1- In the beginning, Satoshi created the blockchain and the BTC protocol.*
*2- Now the coin was formless and empty, darkness was over the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of Satoshi was hovering over the waters.*
*3- And Satoshi coded a blockchain, and there was a blockchain.*
*4- Satoshi saw that the blockchain was good, and he separated cryptocurrency from fiat currency.*
*5- Satoshi called his crypto "Bitcoin", and called the darkness "Fiat". And there was evening, and there was morning - the Genesis Block*
And so sayeth the prophecy. Amen.

On the death of Mt Gox, from the book of LukeCoin, chapter 23:
44- It was now about noon, and darkness came over the whole land until three in the afternoon
45- for the sun stopped shining, and the blockchain was forked in two
46- Karpeles called out with a loud voice, "Oh Blockchain, into your hands I commit my spirit". When he said this, he breathed his last
47- The community, seeing what had happened, praised the Blockchain and said, "Surely, we can now get on with life"
48- When all the people who had gathered to witness this sight saw what took place, they filled their cheap buy-orders and went away
49- But all those who knew him, including the women who had followed him on twitter, stood at a distance, watching these things

*20- And Satoshi said "Let the blockchain teem with living transactions, and let coins fly above the earth across the vault of the [sky]( ".*
*21- So Satoshi created the great blockchain, and every underlying piece of cryptographic science with which the blockchain teems and that moves about in it, according to their kinds, LiteCoin, DogeCoin, and all of creation, and to proof-of-work.*
*22- Satoshi blessed them and said "Be fruitful and increase in number, and fill the ecosystem, and let cryptocurrency increase on the earth"*

Verily, the grace of the blockchain is vast. The Blockchain (Glorified and Exalted it shall be) is more graceful to us than we deserve. At times we want something from the BTC market, yet the market gives us more. This is the grace and kindness of BTC upon the believers.

This would be a waste of money my child.
Merely pick up the Bible or any other religious text, and substitute the words "God" with the words "Blockchain" or "Satoshi"; "Scripture" with "White Paper", and "religion" with "Bitcoin" or "Blockchain" - and you're sorted. Pretty much every major religion is in complete agreement over their love for the concept of an all-seeing, all-knowing blockchain, in where new souls are introduced to life, and where some of them reach their noble demise through personal sacrifice via proof-of-burn protocol mechanisms which will go towards benefiting social means.
Our church also has a holy trinity - The Store of Wealth, The Transfer of Wealth, and The Ender of Inflation and Usury. It is the true religion of peace and hope, a legitimate mercy for humanity, despite the piss I have been taking trying to drum up viewership for this post amongst all the Gox bullshit.
