Good job there, guy, but try again.

Pronounce it like only us New Orleanians could spell it, *"Deauxge"*. :)

Not seeing it. He's talking to the new Whip at that scene
@_date: 2014-02-25 02:16:59
a conspiracy I can believe, maybe they were trying to cash out as much as possible, and collect as much fee as possible with the insane volume before putting out the news!
@_date: 2014-02-25 02:45:10
Uhhh try again, guy.
@_date: 2014-02-25 02:38:42
You sure about that?

I can't find Cerulean Tower on the map. [This is the map of Cerulean City]( I think the address might be a fake. You can't even catch magiKarp in Cerulean City.

This isnt the trollbox, guy.
@_date: 2014-07-27 02:47:42
Wow. He does the same thing to me, and the promises seem so convincing.
@_date: 2014-02-20 07:11:30
Or MF Doom
@_date: 2014-02-25 14:28:39
You logged into your troll account just to say that? You're pathetic, and petty.
@_date: 2014-02-25 03:21:12
I see the URL says "insolvency" but its mentioned nowhere in the blog post, something fishy about that.

I clicked on you to message you, to thank you for the Reddit gold (and lively email chat) for purchasing (in BTC) from both of your sites [7bucktees]( and [coinSMITHS]( and I saw this post. I love it so much I'll do it here (even though its a month old and thusly has already fallen into reddit oblivion). I had no idea you went through so much trouble to keep the BTC you receive in the form of BTC, good stuff.
@_date: 2014-02-20 06:48:13
Now he's getting 'a talking to' by security for shouting at them. Album updated.
Holy Karp, I like this guy.

You're not doing it right. Gox trades are disabled.
@_date: 2014-02-25 03:25:09
 Gox site is down.
@_date: 2014-02-25 03:00:16
Dude, its because you're wrong. Trades are halted at Gox. You can't just try to put a trade through that you dont have funds for, it has to be a legit trade to get the error, pal.
@_date: 2014-02-25 02:28:43
And here comes the DUMP!

I never received my order either. I paid in Bitcoin back in Jan 2014 so of course I have no recourse.
[Here's screencaps of my entire conversation with him.]( Notice the amicable nature, yet reneged on all resolutions.
I'm well.. I'm not *glad* to hear other people are having the same problem per se but I'm glad my situation isn't exemplary. It seems AB Dada has white a big trend of lying to his customers and y'know what- threads like this kill a reputation. Maybe AB Dada will some day stop it with the runaround and empty promises, or some day will close up shop- I REALLY hope one of the two things happen, I do still want the man to continue to thrive but not if he keeps dicking his customers around like this.
If you're reading this, how about that refund? I'd REALLY like that refund (*NOT store credit*). You can just keep the order that you've "already had printed twice." I wish I could continue to be amicable and just send you another email but it'll just get ignored or you'll renege a commitment yet again.
@_date: 2014-02-25 03:19:03
I'll wave "hi" to you as you sit in 20 mile long stopped traffic on the spillway! I've actually got to go out of town this weekend :C

If you read that page and watch the videos it'll show otherwise.
It is, however, a slang for "dog". Pronounced like *"Deauxge"*.
@_date: 2014-02-16 23:33:19
True story.
@_date: 2014-02-25 02:48:33
I just watched again! Strong Bad says "Deauxge"!

Okay. So that part of the concept is plain as day. 
Of course, within no time the mining community will jump on it in another rush and difficulty would quickly catch up quick and compensate.
