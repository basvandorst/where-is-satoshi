As an American asthmatic that used Advair and had to switch to symbicort, let me say a few things:
- My employer changed insurance providers last year so I was forced to take Caremark for prescriptions (even after I read through the all the options and used their drug-look-up function and found they don't cover the meds I need) With this insurance, I would be paying $300 for Advair and $180 for an antihistamine/steroid nasal spray per month!
- Neither Advair nor Symbicort have a generic yet, from what I understand. And in my case almost all the other similar maintenance inhalers have given me upper respiratory infections, so those aren't an option for me- and I'm not alone in that. Previously I was taking Advair, but that was no longer covered in Caremark.
-Luckily, my solution was to tell my doctor, and we sat in his office looking up similar antihistamine/steroid meds costs on my insurance, and then he gave me a symbicort coupon that is valid for a year, making the inhaler cost $25 per month.
To me, the article did a good job of showing how desperate a person can be when dealing with life-giving medicine needs and a broken insurance system. However, like you, I do wonder if they tried to get a coupon, or tell their doctor about the cost, before buying it illegally and waiting a month for it's arrival. 
My doctor called in my new cheaper prescriptions, and gave me a coupon, so that I could have my breathing meds That Same Day. Instead, the author's wife had to wait a month, on a timeline that required her to supplement with rescue inhalers... Maybe the thrill outweighed the risk.
