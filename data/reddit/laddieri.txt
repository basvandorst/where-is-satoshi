There is a huge upfront cost to mining since you have to buy a specialized computer called an ASIC to mine Bitcoin. Mining on a regular computer is not possible at this point. So mining is a no go for 99.9% of people.
If you're looking to get into Bitcoin without buying and without mining you could check out lolli.com. It's a browser plugin that pays you in Bitcoin for shopping  online. They have some huge partners including Walmart.com. So you can earn Bitcoin just from doing your normal shopping. They also have a FAQ page that might answer a few of your questions about Bitcoin.
If you're looking for the easiest way to buy a small amount of Bitcoin, download the Cash App buy square. You can buy as little $1 worth of Bitcoin.
Before putting any money in, you should research how Bitcoin works and understand the risks of owning Bitcoin. Search for Andeas Antonopoulos on YouTube and watch as many of his videos as possible.  
Bitcoin is super fun but it requires you to be more responsible. Eventually you should own your own private keys so that no one else has access to your coins. But, If you lose them, your money may be gone forever. There is no FDIC to bail you out.
Stay away from Bitcoin.com and any site linked to it, It's a scam. Bitcoin.org is the real Bitcoin website.
Hope that helps.

Transacting in Bitcoin is not inherently dangerous. It's just that any internet connected device has the potential to be hacked. Therefore you should not store tons of Bitcoin on any intent connected device. Eventually you could get a hardware wallet that stores the keys to your Bitcoin offline. 
I know nothing about the dark web. Bitcoin does not require you to be on the dark web.

The price of Bitcoin can rise and fall but you don't actually lose anything as long as you don't sell it when the price is low. Once you buy .01 Bitcoin you have that amount of Bitcoin regardless of what the price does. If the price goes down it may not be worth as much as you paid for it. If the price goes up, it could be worth more than you paid for it.
But if you store your Bitcoin on your phone and your phone is lost or hacked, you literally lose access to your Bitcoin and it's gone forever. You then no longer have the money you used to buy it and you don't have the Bitcoin. Double bad.

Cash app and Lolli may be US only. So they may not work if you're outside the US.

Yeah, that line is a real wakeup call.

A while back I sent a payment over the lightning network to watch some M&amp;Ms fall out of a candy dispenser over a YouTube Live Stream. Very exciting technology. I hope someday I look back and regret how much I spent to buy someone their own M&amp;Ms.

Cool! Lightning is Awesome!

"The Bitcoin Standard" makes these exact points. Good read so far.

The more people that use Bitcoin as a currency, the more stable the price will be. Someday items may start being priced in Bitcoin.  It'd be strange because prices of items would go down over time because of deflation.
Until then, you can buy something with Bitcoin and then replace the Bitcoin you spent by buying more Bitcoin at the current exchange rate. The price fluctuation doesn't really affect you because  you still have the same amount of Bitcoin. It's an additional step that isn't required if you had just used cash to pay for what you purchased directly, but it helps encourage Bitcoin adoption and therefore leads towards more stable prices. It's also fun to actually use Bitcoin in the world rather than just as a speculative investment. Feels like you're living in the Future.
The Cash app by Square let's you withdraw money from your bank account instantly and buy Bitcoin instantly with no fees. You can then withdraw Bitcoin from the  Cash app to any Bitcoin wallet for free. It makes the process of replacing the Bitcoin you spent very easy. I'm not trying to endorse Square as a company, but they've made buying Bitcoin very easy.
