I really love this community. You learn new things about btc everyday

The guest at cnbc the other day said that micropayments is the market gap that bitcoin has successfully filled and can jumpstart eventual mainstream adoption. I really hope it's soon

Shoot i thought it's going to be beamed and seen by many...

You got a link? I don't see it

Great. Maybe then we can stop funding the welfare programs for other dumb anti-science states like Texas and Mississippi so we can use it on our own.

Unanswered question: what's the standard when your trades are way too many to cite each on a written paper similar to how day traders do it, do they ship a CD-rom/USB stick then what exactly do you indicate or write in 8949? "see CD" or whatever?

These dumb neocons hate that their theory is so wrong now that the poorest states are all red while the richest ones are blue. Not even relative per capita. They have the highest poverty levels period.

Huh? You just set your own transaction fees with the wallet you use. Are you new to bitcoin? Electrum and Samourai are bech32 enabled since last year. Ledger too

Funny how you jumped to all those hoops thinking just because I want Medicare for California (which we already have as Medi-CAL) means I want open border. Spoken like a real NeoCon. Oh but for sure you want cops retain their union status and their pensions. ROFL so much for small government. A convenient version that is.

Can somebody tell me exactly what are the chances of the US government banning or even criminalizing Bitcoin trade as Dimon had been suggesting?  Also, do you guys think Bitcoin will fail long term if Coinbase decides to sell their company to Goldman Sachs?

Tf are you talking about? Aside from our surplus, we're 6th richest economy in the world, richer than France and we're not even a country.  We also fund the dumb ass red states for their welfare, good thing they want to abolish it. We're tired of funding for anti science folks.

"OK Google, what is 1 BTC in USD"
Been there for ages.
Don't be a newb come on

There are virtually close to zero fees in Gdax and that's a Coinbase division, that was back in December. Maybe you're buying bitcoin in their retail side, which will also now implement SegWit before the end of the month.

Guys, does anyone know that term that the government utilizes to artificially increase the stock market like how during Obama it rose to 236% and now 13% during Trump and it just keeps on going up. I don't think it's credit default swap but I don't remember.

This entire topic screams, "Why you should never eat almonds ever again, not even in moderation!" extreme type of biased bs

My point is that you have singled out one implementation when the same, if not worse, consequences happen in other wallets like hardware. You argue an explicit claim that paper wallet is inherently dangerous and then recommend seed phrases in the same breath.
@_date: 2018-12-20 19:26:56
Many hardware wallets get corrupted. I've seen way too many ledger and trezor horror stories that burn, go kaput, and are no longer recoverable. Paper wallets per se are not the issue. It's how they are executed by the user that poses the danger.
