So late to the part but want to say congrats anyways. Here's to another productive bitcoin year.

If he spent 40k on bitcoin in 2011, wouldn't he have been a millionaire awhile ago? 
(if he held till now)

I trust them enough to give them my personal information. 
You have to take into account that the people who are  unhappy are going to be more vocal than the ones that have a good experience. 
They verify the bank account with small deposits then they have an ACH system to deduct the money. 
Do some more research on Coinbase if you still are unsure.

Sound reasoning. :)

When do they flag you? Instantly or right before payment transaction?

Thanks for posting this I'll probably buy something for my girlfriend.

Ask for 100 dollar bills or the biggest denomination for the purchase so you aren't walking around with a stack of 5s or 1s.

If you are using localbitcoins escrow service and want feedback then yes you have to show each other the security code to release the funds. 
But I've done buys where he sends me the bitcoin over Coinbase so he doesn't take a 1% hit. It's up to you.

I choose to do the small deposits. I would recommend this as giving away your password seems unsafe to me. 
Although it does take 3 to 4 days that way.

10% over your agreed exchange price. You could use Gox for maximum profit and no one would blink an eye.
