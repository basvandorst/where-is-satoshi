are you sure this is right?  how would i enter my seed word on the trezor itself.  The trezor gave me the order that i needed to enter the seeds.  As far as i know i was on the trezor website entering it.  how would i enter the 24 seeds directly into the trezor itself?

I have nothing on my trezor but about 2 days ago i decided to update the firmware.  I had to enter all 24 of my seed words.  Then i tried to update the bridge and that update crashed my computer.  I tried about 3 times and it kept crashing.  I gave up.  now i see this article.  The screen shots look very similar to what i saw, but i dont recall a red "not secure".    I also never entered an order   How do i know if i have been hacked?  again my trezor was empty, but wonder if i should get a new one or move to the nano.
this is scary stuff man.  I am by no means computer illiterate and i dont even know if i have been hacked.  This type of stuff makes me want to move on. in cash to ride our the down market right now.
edit: just saw comments below.  I thought the article meant order   My trezor made me update in some random order my 24 seed words.  It came from the trezor and entered them into the website.  how do i know if i have been hacked?

this certainly did not happen and the youtube videos show the opposite of what you're saying.  I am going to reset the trezor.  no reason not to and tough to get a straight answer.

this is a very good point.  Hopefully somebody from trezor will come on here and clarify what the heck is going on.

yeah, i dont think this is right.  I can see from the video below is what i did to update the firmware.
can you clarify when you have a chance?  I am super paranoid now.

well, i had no idea.  thank you.  I dont know how i would enter the 24 seeds into the trezor itself as there is no keyboard.  This is absolutely terrifying and very lucky that i did not have any coins on it.  
What can i do now?  Can I reset the trezor and start from scratch or is the thing wasted now.  I am petrified and dead serious this is very concerning.  I updated the firmware as i received the trezor notification.  Absolutey insane.

I think he is wrong too.  thanks for your response.  I can see on multiple youtube videos how the seed recovery process works and it is exactly what I did.  Also, the update on trezor blog said you would need to use the recovery seed for this update.  I am fine, but man what a lesson.  Scary stuff.
