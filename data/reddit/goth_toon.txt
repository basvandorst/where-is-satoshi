I'd slightly modify that to "value is power".  People who are rich don't keep assets in money, they measure their power by the monetary worth of those assets.  Most rich people (and I mean truly wealthy) are diversified into things that, on the whole, hold the value and therefore the power.  They care very little about what happens to any particular localized currency, unless they have a philanthropic kind of personality.  
Sadly, in the end, it's the working class of people that pay that price of failure.

I'm saying they should do it if they are going to claim there is an urgent feature that needs to be done. there is no "those developers" in open source.  Even with their own wallet, they are still tied to the majority wallet specification, so they cant have it both ways: complain about the protocol and not contribute anything.  That's how open source works.  They can afford a good programmer.  One that's familiar with the reference wallet would benefit Mt. Gox and the community.
On the BTC-e side, several points:
* they aren't on the news crapping on litecoin
* they haven't express there is a feature they need as a business
* if they ever do one of those two things, then yes they should either shut up and wait or contribute to the code

The [2014 budget for printing money]( in the US is 826.665 million. At [the average cost of electricity]( in the US being $0.13 per kw/h. The cost of running 1 gh/s of mining is 1 watt or less (it's moving lower in the newer hardware to about half a watt), so lets use this to calculate how much mining could be done and still not surpass the US budget alone.
One kilowatt hour contains 1000 watts.  One Tera hash costs 0.13 cents per hour. There are 8760 hours per year.  One Terra hash costs $1138.8 a year. We could run 725.909 peta hash without out paying more for bitcoin than the US dollar. 
Current technology is pushing towards 0.5 watt per gh/s. At that point, we could run about 1.4 [exa hash](
 Currently, [The us population is 4.45%]( of the world population at 322,583,006 people.
This does not include the costs of ATMs, banks, credit card networks, data centers, fraud prevention, identity theft, buildings, transportation (both gas and vehicles) or impact on the environment of natural resource consumption, chemicals for dyes, etc.
It is also, only the cost of one country's physical money.  It would be extraordinarily difficult for bitcoin to cost more than fiat to produce, handle or secure.
A lot has been written about the carbon footprint of bitcoin, but I propose, to those with concerns, that bitcoin places that squarely on the electricity production methods.  The impact is only the amount that we chose to produce electricity using high carbon production techniques for electricity.  As the world moves towards eco friendly production, Bitcoin rides a long and it isn't a result of bitcoin, but a choice the world makes about electricity.
Also, there are places you can run mines that are much lower than the average residential US rate of 13 cents.  As that price goes lower, the more hash we can support within this budget.
Edit: The [current network hashrate]( is around 250 peta hash.

Only problem I see there is that wages have flat lined, minimum concern would the  time to adjustment in the labor in a spiraling inflation scenario.  It's mostly on the consumables level, where the rate of change would potentially outpace the rate of change in pay.  Especially since the corporate employer's goal are not to give the most value to the employee, but to get the employee to work while minimizing costs.  I doubt it would be zero sum losses to the working class.

You imagine incorrectly.  There are two separate ledgers, Mt. Gox's internal wallet/ledger and the Blockchain ledger.   What you are looking at here is the Mt. Gox internal ledger.  
High frequency trading cannot take place on the bitcoin blockchain, as it's not designed for that (confirmations every 10 minutes).  Hence, Mt. Gox ran an offchain ledger and order book.  
The entire issue (according to accounts from Gox/community) is that this ledger was completely out of synch with Mt. Gox's blockchain balances.  So when they looked internally, everything looked perfectly fine and all the money was there.  
They had little to no fraud prevention or checks between the two ledgers.  It sounds like they rarely/never reconciled with the block chain to verify how many actual on-chain coins they possessed.

Hey I'm not pro or con this, I'm just saying how it would work and that it is possible.  In the end, the market will decide.  I personally think it depends on how much friction, internal and external, bitcoin runs into trying to do this.  
What am I pro on? rational discussion about it.  Why would I argue against you? because you are emotional and insulting.


I'm not creating anything. Somebody said it wasn't possible, I merely pointed out how it could and appears to be designed to work.  This has nothing to do with me as a person.

This this this!
Bitcoin is an unregulated currency in it's infancy.  It is not designed to be day traded like a penny stock.  The exchanges are the highest risk centralized point in the whole bitcoin workflow.  This risk needs to be minimized as much as possible.  Basically, your coins only sit on the exchange immediately before selling, or briefly after buying.
The most attractive thing about bitcoin, after the money transmission protocol, is the ability to self bank in a trust-less manner.  Meaning I only have to be able to trust myself (and the wallet software. . . I won't go too deep in the variations of this) to know my funds are secure.  Combined with the protocol, I can self bank and use my funds like a visa card, without any other entity having control.  
It's a beautiful system, when used properly.  When day traded on an exchange controlled by a third party, not so much.
I truly feel for the people who lost coin.  All we can do, at this point, is pick ourselves up, learn, and move forward.

I think of it more like a check.  The txid is like the "For" line on a check,  you can write whatever you want in it and it has nothing to do with the validity of the check. (I had a friend who thought it was quite funny to write insults/perverse things in the for line. . never once did somebody not cash it) It's like Mt. Gox is tracking checks using the For line of the check, instead of the check number/account number (wallet), date and amount.  
Edit: txid is an unfortunate/terrible name for this field, but it's actual function is well documented on a wiki run by one of the people working for Gox.  they can't claim ignorance on the matter

No competent IT person running a multi-million dollar financial system would rely on a publicly known changeable field as an identifier and the ONLY form of data validation used when handling money.  It's just flat stupid.  How the hell would a customer service rep not look at the transaction history based on date, value and wallet address and not see that the payment was sent from Gox to the customer?  To blame that on the Bitcoin protocol isn't even remotely valid.  It's a procedural and data validation issue.  They obviously have no fraud prevention systems running, which is just plain ignorant.  They have consistently (imo) shown a desire to do as little as possible, not behave responsibly (legally or in coding their exchange), and spend as little money as they can then ride the train (exchange) until it runs out of fuel.  People need to get their money out of that hell hole of an exchange and shutter it as soon as possible.  They are the bane of bitcoin.

I think this is the very reason they are in bankruptcy, otherwise they'd only be legally out the cash being held by the US.
Also, as an example of technology advancements, the case of digital signatures being legally binding.  Originally people were trying to get out of contracts they had digitally signed and others were not accepting digital signatures.  They would make you snail mail or fax documents.  There was a case, early/mid 2000 I believe, and subsequent legislation that solidified the legality of digital signatures.  Now they are common place.

so you do not help facilitate adoptions what so ever? If you do "assist" people with adopting (obviously you don't do the legal work and that's the governments hand), are you stating you're willing to assist atheist, muslims, jewish, or Hindu family's adoption?  If so, you need to amend your Articles of Organization, because they are an explicit/legal declaration what your organization's purpose is with the state. Any Christian person donating under the pretense of your intent/purpose might feel they aren't getting the facts. And any non-christian, would have to look at that with a raised eyebrow.

The law doesn't necessarily change.  Can't you just build into the real world contract that **X** title company will act as the **Oracle** (Third Party transaction signer in the bitcoin protocol) and have power of attorney under the condition that the token representing the piece of property is moved to a new owner.  
The Use Case would look something like this:
* Owner of a piece of property wants to bitcoin enable the property
* Owner registers the title/property under contract with a bitcoin asset/title management company and agree on transfer fees
* Owner colors one satoshi and registers it as the token of ownership
* Owner sells property to an individual for a btc price
* a single transaction is created that transfers the colored satoshi,  the btc payment for property, and payment of title transfer fees (this is the Management Companies take).
* The seller signs the transaction and sends it to the seller
* The buyer signs the transaction and sends it to the Oracle (Management Company)
* The signed and verifiable transaction triggers the power of attorney clause in the management contract 
* the Oracle signs and transmits the transaction to the bitcoin network
* When the agreed upon number of confirmations occurs (probably determined by the value of the property), the management company executes the title transfer.  Everybody gets paid/property control at once.
Please explain why this doesn't work in the real world.  It is a digital signing of an agreement.  There would be some contract sent via email/what-ever-mechanism-we-make to make sure all parties digitally sign/understand what is up, but other than that, at least in the US, digital sigs are legally binding.

I'm talking about it being on a 30 year scale, not solely focused on the 90s, being misleading because the data you are focusing on starts in 1990 when the network became public. the scale of the time axis compresses/exaggerates the ramp.  lol nice engaging wording there. . . &gt;&lt;

I agree with you except in the case of the un-banked.  With Cash ATMs it does provide them with options for digital commerce and the it's getting harder and harder to live without being able to. 
Secondly, since I do have a bank account, I like the push technology of bitcoin.  Having been in  retail IT and having seen some of crap people try to push off as security, I cringe every time I give someone my credit card number, swipe it on a CC machine, or have to read it out loud over the phone.

I think bitcoin is an amazing vehicle for these types of activities.  It allows us to give money directly to people doing good works and making a difference in the world.  
Large "Non-profits" leech so many dollars/currency from the system due to massive overhead and outreach campaigns.  Social media has made these organizations, not only out dated, but also bloated, unnecessary, and impeding to people on the ground.  I hope other front-line people can find their way to bitcoin/internet fundraising and we can get more of the help to the people who actually use it properly.

unless you're suggesting we all get on horses and drag them through town, they did do something.  They filed 1000s of complaints with the FTC and local consumer protection entities, that's why the FTC moved on them.   Other than that, there were a few filings in civil court.  There was little else to do, other than warn people in the forums.  There were constant warnings to the point of annoying.
  The rest was a waiting game.  This was no surprise and BFL seemed to be belligerent every time the topic was brought up.  
It all just takes time for the government to act and verify.  So the only way to change that is to go vote or run for office.

This explanation is actually why I believe people are acting out.  There have been many people trying to warn off new folks from gox.  After april 2013, I personally wanted them to go away for good.  These efforts were met with a huge level of douche baggery and self interest, even being buried by down votes and mods.
I'm not saying it's the right thing to do and my heart goes out to the innocent.  
I do understand the frustration of people who have been downvoted and told they have no idea wtf they are talking about when suggesting everyone gtfo of  mt gox.  It is maddening to see a thing coming you know is going to hurt people, and have said people tell you you're an ass for trying to warn them.
That being said, it's pretty cold blooded to kick people who have lost a lot of money.  Even though we know they shouldn't have been in the position in the first place,  it's still livelihood at stake.

For just wallet generation, I'd use armory on a linux live cd/usb . . .setup not to save new files.  download, compile, generate the wallet, and print (2 or 3 copies).  I wouldn't install the OS on the laptop at all
@_date: 2014-02-21 20:45:05
you wouldn't if you were doing 100s of thousands of transactions a day and had a small staff who was ill prepared.  Since you couldn't handle the volume manually, you decided the best move was to automate it, instead of hiring more people.
Here's to hoping the transfer between hot and cold storage was not automated as well. . . .and if it was, that they at least noticed it in a reasonable amount of time
@_date: 2014-04-09 20:14:18
This is precisely why bitcoin is considered property by the IRS.  Rich people can buy it, invest in it, and not have to pay tax until they cash it out, even then it's capital gains.  Anywhere you see the stamp of capital gains on something, know it's been targeted and lobbied by rich people for potential wealth growth.
They don't need to use it to buy things.  They need to store wealth in appreciating assets.  Only poor people need frictionless transactions and self hosted banking.
Edit: I'm not saying this is the way to go, I'm just observing this is what is happening.
@_date: 2014-11-14 17:05:30
IMO, Buttercoin screwed over their opensource supporters and sold out for the cash.  The whole thing was being put together after Gox couldn't scale april 2013, which crashed the market price, and was suppose to provide software for scalable order books for exchanges to use.  
Personally, No way I'd ever support or trust these guys after they took golden goose and ran off with it.
@_date: 2014-06-18 08:34:42
Wallet services are not under fincen reg.  If they keep the whole money transfer on the client and behave as a wallet, they will not be running afoul (as it stands today) of fincen.  
@_date: 2014-06-18 22:03:15
This is only true if the wallet is hosted, what I'm proposing is that they actually just include a multi-crypto wallet that's integrated in the game.  There is no use case of an individual running a wallet on their local computer triggering FinCen regulation.  They need not host the wallet or control the transaction, only sign the transaction to receive their cut.  Of course, check with a lawyer, as I'm not one, but It is highly likely that they would be seen as an e-bay style service and not a money transmitter.  
All this would only be possible in cryptos that have multisig transactions, since they neither host the users wallet nor hold the money on behalf of someone else to transfer it.
They should never issue coins.  There is no reason for them to do so.
Also, another advantage of this is that they would not face capitalization costs for holding funds.  Since they hold no money except their own.
Edit: I'd put a cap on transaction size to be extra safe

So you do not make recommendations or have any input what-so-ever or seek candidates to be consider for adoption?
On the Articles of Organization "Purpose" Here's what I mean:
 
* What is the purpose of your LLC? 
* This is an easy one. Before going into business, you need to know what sort of business you are in! This can be as specific or broad as you like. However, I recommend that you keep your company's purpose broad so you aren't limited by what you put in your articles of organization.
so technically, you are not even allowed to deal with anybody or have contact with anyone who is not Christian and interested in adopting a foster child.  Now, granted they can do it through local government, but legally your not even allowed to talk with a non-christian about it. You created that limitation when you created your organization.  So, don't be flippant about the legal "Purpose" of your organization, it binds you and defines you.  Technically, if you are not promoting Christian beliefs and are not performing an Evangelical mission, you are violating your purpose in Bolivia and could lose non-profit status. 
Or at least that's my understanding of it, having formed/been involved with several companies.
@_date: 2014-05-14 17:40:44
You need the same level you do when buying any piece of property.  For instance, you buy a house, you go through a title company.  The only thing that changes here is the method of signing, no banks involved in payment and that it occurs digitally (no more sitting in a room for 2 hours at a title company).  The trustless part of bitcoin has to do with with the peer to peer network, security of the blockchain, and btc value transfer. 
It is an absurd troll to say that buying a property, house or car is trustless.  Obviously you would want to do this through a reputable Oracle.

This and it's important to remember most sites that hold a lot of BTC don't keep their reserves in hot wallets, so when there are large movements in BTC, it sometimes takes time to move coins from cold storage to create the liquidity needed to cover the requests.

It's up to the community to evaluate those requests and ensure they are implemented in a way that is useful to bitcoin as a whole.

This would provide an easy, scalable avenue for new countries/groups to deploy proven, trustworthy (in a software sense) code.  None of these project goals were met in that repo.  It doesn't assist with "turn key" style deployment.  It gives you an order book and that's it.  The rest they kept to themselves and turned into a profit machine.  imo, a bad move.

We would all like banks not to be asshats, but we all also know that they are ultra conservative institutions that are extraordinarily risk adverse when it comes fringe businesses.  It shows an extreme level of naivety, entitlement and denial that you can't realize why they feel the way they do.
Your anger about people not agreeing with your assessment of the situation just shows an unwillingness to consider a differing opinion or handle criticism in a mature manner.  Perhaps you could consider what's being said and find a way to market yourself a bit better.  Maybe even research a bank that's a bit more friendly to your plight as well.

"Bitcoin100 exists specifically to convince new charities to start accepting bitcoin donations. Many Bitcoin enthusiasts of various backgrounds from around the world have supported this project with time, effort and/or bitcoins. In order to use donated funds in a manner consistent with donor expectations, Bitcoin100 donates the Bitcoin equivalent of $1000 to **non-political, secular charities** that prominently display an option for supporters to contribute via Bitcoin on their website."

oop sorry then, still waking up. . .Bitcoin solves the issues of the unbanked.  There are a huge number of unbanked people in the US, and this is most of the reason gift cards/cash loaded cards exist.  It becomes a vehicle for currency on a digital exchange, a method of transfer (both P2P and P2B), and a method of storage and transport.  The fees for these activities, even in the first world, are a huge burden for these people and they do want a solution. It gives them access to online commerce as well.

The rule in security is the value of the target should be less than the cost to extort it.  By splitting large coin deposits into multiple wallets, you reduce the value of a single (perceived) target, therefore, decreasing the interest of the parties, that have the facilities, to extort that target.

According to the articles of incorporation for Kaya Children International, Inc.  This organization is without a doubts a non-secular, religious organization.
"To operate on **evangelical Christian mission** to aid the homeless, abandoned children and orphans in and around La Paz, Bolivia;
To provide physical, **spiritual**, practical and education to homeless, abandoned children and orphans in and around La Paz, Bolivia;
To assist said children and orphans long-term needs by fostering and encouraging adoption by, able, willing and loving **Christian** parents;
Not only are they, in fact, an extension of a religious community, spreading Christianity, but they practice prejudicial adoption practices, in my opinion, at least according to the wording on their Articles of Organization filed with the state of Mass.
This statement implies, at minimum, that a christian couple would get preferential treatment over, lets say, a Muslim, Atheist, or Hindu.

so are you saying that:
* the parts can be identified by hash or some id of sort
* obviously the parts you have can't be reconstructed to the whole file
* the end user (owner) can reconstruct the file
* the end user (owner) has the password
I posted this off a diff thread, but you may not have seen it because it was in response to somebody who got down voted to oblivion.
If a criminal file/user gets in trouble (which they often do, see SR) and exposes the password. then an authority (cops, whatever) can reconstruct the file (via the owner's interface) and verify it's illegal.  The software by it's nature would expose an inventory list of the block (data segments/whatever you guys use to term it) hashes that were used to construct it.
Isn't it at least feasible that an authority/isp could either sniff the network to see who's serving them and/or during an unrelated action identify an illegal hash stored locally on a drive?
TOR would help with this on the network side, except for the case where authorities grab a hard drive from a machine.

I think the answer is somewhere between the two of you.  If you have a significant blockchain oriented business, you should have a database dump of the chain that has automated and human fraud prevention.  Haplessly re-issuing transactions is more of a problem than a solution.  These types of analytic/forensic tools would have stopped this problem cold and allowed them to properly address creating immutable ids for their system.  The solution could have been implemented by anyone at anytime with or without network support.

A cheap/fast way of doing this, for those not wanting to sign up for more websites, is to put a no password wallet in the default locatioin on any machine you use protected wallets.  Before logging into your wallet, check the blockchain.info page for the address of your "money pot".  If the money is there then you can feel, at least some what, more secure about using your wallet on the machine.

the best way to combat this is to create your own foundation.  Their foundation has their own interest in mind, but isn't even remotely  representative of the community as a whole.
imo, he should just release the data and let the market decide if there is opportunity for a new foundation. If they have squandered their reputation, when the information (assuming it is indeed as venomous as touted) is released they won't have to resign, because they will be on the board of a dead husk.  Then something better will come along, be stronger, and have a good example of how not to behave, if they want to perpetuate their own existence.

lol I know everybody imagines gox ran on some giant server farm, but last year when they talked about buying new hardware and having to re-engineer their code, it became evident they were running a 2 tier configuration (webserver/db server).  so maybe they had 4-6 servers afterwards.  I'd be surprised if there was much more than that, especially considering they only ran one environment (no testing/development servers).  
As far as software/IP goes, there are way better open source systems out there that would cost nothing and come with less baggage.
The only things Gox has of value are the bitcoins themselves.  
I can't imagine why anybody would buy the company, liquidation is the only rational move. Not that any of this is truly rational.

I'd gander a guess that that is each market's demand.  Cex.io has more exposure, I'm sure, if only just because of the link to GHash.io.  That would put more people there to buy, but again just a guess.
and all the other stuff doesn't even account for the shared price paid.  If you use these assets to end of life. you have to get returns equal to investment.  that would be about 13-14 months if difficulty never changed, which is obviously impossible.  Even if they find away to cut fees, it's just a delay of what must happen.
Should be interesting to watch some of these first to market cloud hashing companies over the next few months.  Especially if there are no time limits on the hashing power.

ok I give up.  arbitrary statements without proof or backing data in the implementation are just circle jerks.  If you don't get it now, you won't get it ever. We'll just agree to disagree.
As a side note, for informational purposes, there are major differences between SSI(Supplemental Security Income), SSD(Social Security Disability or SSDI Social Security Disability Insurance), and SS retirement.  SSI is for low income/low asset bearing individuals and insures them in the case of catastrophic disability.  SSD/SSDI insures working people, of modest to high income, against disability.  SS retirement (such that an grandmother/father would have) insures a minimum standard of living for the elderly after they reach an age the government has deemed the continued employment of these individuals is no longer realistic.  The latter two (SSD and SS retirement) are paid into by the individual.  SSI is a minimum general welfare program that protects the poor from disability.

On the other hand, you can't avoid regulation if you still have LLC and other liability limits for corps.  Limited liability subsidizes risk and removes removes free market motives, in turn, causes the need for regulation.  This is why capitalism isn't the same thing as free market anymore.  It's mutated to become subsidized profits and socialized losses. imo.

Hey man that's awesome.  I would suggest that next time, assuming that he's has access to the software, you have him sign a message using his bitcoin keys stating this is the address he wants you to send coin too.  This will act as a digital signature, authorization of payment and verify he's the owner of the signed wallet.  Just a suggestion for how to verify someone owns a specific wallet.
@_date: 2014-06-19 19:57:44
That makes no sense, with private keys you can use a digital signature as proof of identity. (access control over a character).  Much like a pool, such as eligius, uses it to manage payout addresses and wallet level settings.  The blockchain would provide balance information, etc.  There is no reason the game should hold the coins.

Can confirm, same source (Hackpad/IRC).  
I also agree they dropped the ball completely.  The community was supporting this project at the time and we were supposedly working to bring an open source orderbook that was highly optimized for any exchange that was having scaling issue or for new exchanges to come online.  There was so little competition against gox and gox was handling the load so poorly that it was affecting market price.
Fast forward, they ran off and got VC funding and went in hid in the dark to make their own exchange. Now, it seems, they want to try and leverage the "good guy" support they built using name recognition of both buttercoin and google.  Buttercoin is soiled imo and the google support is very much indirect.  I don't think anyone one should take this seriously.
If past behavior is an indicator, I really have issue with trusting these guys.  I can't agree with their moral compass.  
They should have left buttercoin open source and walled off a new company that was acting as an exchange using the open source software.  More like what red hat did with linux and less like what mySQL did with oracle.  
Any how, like I said, I don't feel comfortable with the buttercoin people and their behavior.  Feel free to have a different opinion :)

The point is, if you follow, that the tracing from the originating block to the miners wallet is easy. You can do that easy enough on blockchain's website or your own database if you configure bitcoind properly. As far as the off chain portion goes, I do believe Mark Lamb, **chief executive at Coinfloor,** has access to the off chain data.  you can see what they spend and what they save. in the worst, the numbers he's quoting would be conservative (i.e. they are using multiple exchange to sell, whose data he would not be privy too, would create the illusion, from his perspective, that they were saving more than they are.)

Brick and Mortar mean physical store based business.  Amazon is an internet company.  It also started selling books only. Also it was 1995, they had their 15th aniversary in 2010:
do you know when Walmart went online? the year 2000. . .ten years after the internet.  This illustrates what I'm saying. . .  Walmart is Brick and Mortar.  Amazon is an internet/tech retail store.  
95 was when tech proved to old school business that the internet would work.  '98-'00 is when they began to take it serous.   The boom in 95 was all tech not old school.  I was in the middle of it.  
If you ever used the IIS (their web server) and ActiveX (which was not originally a internet technology) you wouldn't be bragging about them having it.  Netscape Commerce Server was what people used until 95 time range.  CGI/C++ was the real dealio at that time. Edit: Apache web server was of note as well.


I understand the graph is early 90s. I'm saying while if those were dollars/BTC in my pocket it would have been considered amazing, but if you look at it distributed across the actual population, it's not a big number.  IT was niche, which is why retailers didn't get all excited until a few years after the last date on it.

I never said it was trivial. Never once.  I damn well know what it takes.  I've been digging into the code for a while now and am hoping to get to the point where I can help the devs out a bit.  I've integrated with the protocol and am producing data analysis tools for viewing the blockchain.
Having their own wallet implementation, one would hope they have 1 or more developers that could fairly seamlessly assist with the workload of the development team.  Especially with such "urgent" issues that have existed since 2011.  Instead they attack the team that has largely created the foundation of their business without being paid.
@_date: 2014-02-25 12:46:51
Here's my theory on how this could of possibly happened, for what it's worth.  Gox has shown of a pattern of choosing automation over hiring personnel (See the auto-responses for support) along with being slow to adjust to growing demand.  It seems feasible in their effort to maintain their growth, they automated re-issuance of "dead" transaction and may have automated "offline/cold storage" to hot wallet transfers. Combine this with a proven unstable code base that, again just from observation, seems to be under managed/staffed, an accusation that they deploy straight to production and you get a high risk for bugs that could quickly (relative to manually intervention) drain a system of funds before a person intervenes.  I'm not saying this is the actual occurrence, just trying to help understand  how "this could possibly happen".
I will say this has been a huge fear of mine, but with opaque nature of Mt. Gox it was hard to gauge.
Full disclosure: I have hated Mt. Gox since March/April 2013 incidents, since then have done my best to warn people against dealing with them.  I have never held funds on this exchange.

No, because the outputs go to different people than the inputs.
think of it like this.  you and 10 friends have a roll of nickels each.  every one unrolls their nickels and puts their initials on all the coins. At this point, if I find your nickels somewhere I know who they are from. Now, everyone throws all their nickels in a jar and some body shakes them up, Everybody takes the original amount of nickels they threw in minus one nickel each for the jar shaker.  now the initials are meaning less and you just have a bunch of coins that are marked all over the place.
That's the theory anyhow.

it's been know since last march/april gox was going to fail.  it is sad that people lost money.

@_date: 2014-05-14 19:06:43
That's the same question.  I've given you the answers I can think of.  If you don't see value in it, ok.  That's that. For the umptenth time, I"m not advocating this, I'm just observing how it could work within the current legal framework.  The rest the market will decide.  
If it provides value, people will use it.  If it doesn't, then it won't.  All I know is there are a ton of people interested in it and they do want it.  
On a side note, any lawyer could act as an oracle and allow blind trading of titled property via 3rd party (power of attorney) contract execution.  It doesn't have to be this giant monolithic entity.  Before you say it, yes, you have to trust your lawyer.

Actually it is quite fair.  The question begs to be asked, What is the foundation using the money for? Lobbying? Why is it contributed?  Since they obviously and explicitly state they have nothing to do with bitcoin's software, it seems most likely they are paying for the lobbying aspects.  Secondly, since they obviously have their own interests to represent in the bitcoin protocol/software, instead of blaming the developers, they should contribute to it's furtherment explicitly, or they have no right to point fingers when they choose not to have a voice.
Edit: IMO the 25k bought them a board seat, not a developer.  They seem to be interested in controlling the politics.

that's just the entry point, due to the current legal system.  Once the property is enabled, it can be bought and sold freely among participants.  As the legal system changes, if this was to be done, it would be easier.  You'd have to provide identity once to an oracle, because the RL aspects require it for ownership.  Maybe some creative person could find a way around that.
Again, I'm not advocating this, I'm just saying that's how it would have to work.

The foundation has a lot more than code developing going on.  Mainly, lobbying and regulation for businesses.  It's more of a mouth piece than a resource for developers.

In the interest of understanding/furthering this discussion, the effective result of this activity is that, once you can out run the rest of the network, you basically get to solve all of the blocks by hiding your solution and using it to over write other peoples solutions with your hidden longer chain.  
That would be an obvious move and the rest of the network would detect it and revolt.  The more likely manifestation would be somebody uses it to get a few extra blocks, while letting the other miners have fewer, and blames the whole thing on luck.

oh so what do you suppose they were going to do on the internet?  you think it was B2B en masse first?  or that those numbers were businesses?  They were not.  Those were nerds, lots of nerds.  herds of nerds even.  That was not mass adoption.  That was barely a fraction in that chart.  20% of the us population alone isn't even on that chart, much less the world.  Not saying that bitcoin is at 20% either (I wish), but spouting off about a super compressed timeline isn't even remote proof of anything.  Those number are a tiny drop in what it would become. In relative numbers this is 2012:
There were a few niche things online until the end of that graph. . .just about around the amount of time it took for bitcoin to get it's first larger commerce businesses online.
If bitcoin does 10% of what the internet did, it's a win.

It is extremely easy to trace the coins sent to an exchange back to the mining block and know they are recently mined coins.
@_date: 2014-02-24 01:54:03
That's what they have been asking for and blaming it on.  really in the end it doesn't matter if it's include in the bitcoin software, since the solution can be implemented off chain.  
Though your statements are taking my position out of context.  I'm saying if they are saying that the "bitcoin devs need to do this" or "the bitcoin devs are ignoring bugs", then they should be involved with it's development.  It's easy to sit on the sideline and call people names, but in open source if something needs to be done to the code, you sure as hell better have submitting a patch for it before saying that people are ignoring stuff. 
It really has nothing to do with what happen to them, it has to do with their attitude towards open source development. I'm not taking a side on who's semantic interpretation of fault it is.  I'm saying Mt. Gox can't explicitly sit outside of protocol development (a.k.a. the software has nothing to do with us) then in the same conversation start screaming about how the devs are ignoring things.  they either participate in the conversation (contribute) or shut up and fix their software (implement it off chain).  
This goes beyond the source I mentioned.  They are trying to push dev to make changes to the protocol to accommodate their stupidity.

Yeah, thought it was obvious, stating "It's not growing over the past few years." is like saying people in the 1800s sucked at being astronauts. You do realize that it's impossible to say it wasn't "growing over the past few years." since it wasn't being used and was barely even existent in the context of years?  
I thought my questions, in the previous post, would have made it clear implied and explicit.
It's hard to add content to something that's so completely fictional.  It's gone from zero commercial wallets/exchanges to infinitely more in the last year.  
Mt. Gox wasn't commercial, it was a niche business that got in over it's head.

in fairness, yes they do, but bitcoin doesn't encrypt it upload parts of it onto your computer in order to provide it to another person/group of people that have intentions unknown to you.
It's not impossible to decrypt, somebody somewhere has the key.  If that person is both bad at securing passwords and criminal.  It can be tied back to the rest of the system.  
These hashes are identifiers of the the content to reconstruct the data blocks for the user you are serving. they can then be found on your machine running the software.  Any isp or mesh net can be snooped by the nature of the network.  
As an example, stupid user gets busted client side with illegal data on his machine and an exposed password.  you would just have to identify who is using the protocol, wait to see a flagged hash roll by and then charge in (cops gonna snatch your drives).  it doesn't matter that you can't decrypt the data, because they already did on the end user side, they just need to know your serving it up.
Any anonymizing network like TOR would help with this, but if for any reason your machine is compromised and/or the data store discovered your asking for bad times in pound town.
Anybody been paying attention to PRISM at all!??!?!

Let's try getting one coin onto ATMs then push the update later, people are already confused enough.
Additionally, crypto (imo) would make a lot of consumers nervous.  I can vouch that 99% of my family/firends don't even know what SSL is, much less cryptography, but only few don't know the word ATM or Coin.  Quite a few of them have heard of bitcoin.  I wouldn't even want to look at the menu system for trading all the alt coins. This product is aimed (at least for now) at bringing bitcoin to the masses in a convenient and familiar form factor with minimal confusion.  
I do think it would hilarious, though, to watch teenagers sit on them for an hour at a mall playing the thing like a video game. only to walk away with a pout and a story of how they almost made millions, and lost it all on that damn 'Cryptoterminal'.  I can see all the facebook posts now. hehe

Bitcoin isn't going to be exactly the same, but there are parallels.  Saying the internet had no friction in the beginning or that it was widely accept with enthusiasm by business is a complete and utter farce.  It was people innovating and pushing the technology from the roots that made it happen.  Just like bitcoin, the internet had to prove to old school business that it was a useful technology.  It's just a fact man.  Saying it isn't or quoting some off data, doesn't change that.

After reading through your site, I noticed you were originally formed as a church organization.  That prompted me to ask a few questions.  Do you have religious services on site?  (Services, prayer groups, Sunday school, bible study, etc)
Edit Summary/TLDR of the research:
* Kaya ~~is~~ was affiliated with Park street church
* Kaya uses prayer to "claim their lives for the Kingdom of God"
* Park Street Church is a "Pray the gay away church" &lt;--- confirmed on yelp to still be going on 1/8/2014
* They are now saying they left Park Street Church behind and are associated with the Lutheran Church
* Fairness update: The American Lutheran church is officially all inclusive of any lifestyle within the christian religion.  In 2013, the ELCA elected its first openly gay bishop.
* instead of consolidating their office and putting in more beds for the children, they did it to build a chapel
* the chapel space was "unsuitable for beds", but yes they have a chapel
* Bitcoin100 states they donate to "non-political, secular charities" so soliciting them implies you are such
* there is a big difference between them and SeansOutpost
* They agree to refund any donations sent from people not realizing they are a religiously purposed organization
* Kaya requested update to clarify "We are an independent 501(c) 3 and don't want people mislead that we are run by, supported or endorsed by any particular church"
* the board chair is an ELCA pastor
* Articles of Organization filed in State of Mass found to state: "To operate on **evangelical Christian mission** to aid the homeless, abandoned children and orphans in and around La Paz, Bolivia;.....To assist said children and orphans long-term needs by fostering and encouraging adoption by, able, willing and loving **Christian** parents"
* They seem imply that a Muslim, Atheist, or Hindu would not be allowed to adopt a child with this organization.
* Fairness update: They are not legally involved in adoption, so really have no say in what/who happens.
* The filings in Bolivia for the formation of "Kaya Foundation" are not religiously focused, though the donations are solicited by/given to the US Entity (Kaya Children International, Inc) and it's statement of purpose highlighted recently.
* Was stated that they would allow Non-Christian volunteers into their organization.
Summary of my opinion of the conversation: This organization has gone through a series of refocusing/evolutions.  Their footprint on the internet is extremely confusing.  It seems they are populated with an all christian workforce, but did express that non-Christians would be welcome to volunteer.  The declaration of Purpose in their Articles of Organization, filed in MASS USA, is concerning, from a non-Christian perspective.  The Articles are 13 years old and may not fully express the intent of the organization at this current date and time.  Personally, I still feel a bit put off by the US side of the organization, and sincerely hope they can successfully amend their statement of purpose and messaging on the internet.  I am going to offer helping with their website.

exactly. . . I don't think you looked closely at what was going on in that graph. . . 
The numbers on the beginning of that compressed ramp are deceiving due to the time frame of the over all graph and the shitty hand drawing.
It also took 5 years for the first reasonably amount of movement in retail to happen.  Sound familiar?
I was also started in 1969 and took 31 years to be opened to the public and 4-6 more before your "average people" would come online.
Microsoft didn't take it serious until after the mid 90s.

after spending my morning reading this thread, I think there are things both sides seem to forget/ignore.
* This is free market, these guys can do it if they want to
* It's useful to see some of these experiments run in their own space, so we don't risk the relatively stable money (Bitcoin) to find out where the limits are
* Bitcoin is software.  I love when people say/think some feature in an altcoin is going to kill BTC.  If a feature is useful and doesn't conflict, it will get move into BTC at some point.
There aren't a whole lot of things that can't be put into the bitcoin protocol, but they should be tested and selected carefully.  The best way for this to happen is an alt coin.   
I look forward to seeing how this experiment works out.  I do find it obnoxious that they are asking for funding instead of proving worth and then getting paid, but hey, that's between them and anybody willing to give them money.

Please see the sidebar rules
* Begging/asking for bitcoins is absolutely not allowed, no matter how badly you need the bitcoins. Only requests for donations to large, recognized charities are allowed, and only if there is good reason to believe that the person accepting bitcoins on behalf of the charity is trustworthy.

For those on mobile:
Today I was once again inspired by the faithfulness of our Kaya staff.  I'm always surprised by how many people ask about the role that faith plays in Kaya.  Simple answer: it's the foundation of everything we do and the source of our love for the children we serve.  Here's a message our program director, Ximena Alarcon, shared with me.  **I'm inspired by the Kaya's staff willingness to make personal sacrifices for the sake of creating a space of prayer for our children.**  I hope you join us in joining our Kaya staff in praying for our children and Kaya's ministry.
Ximena begins by explaining a struggle with one of our children and continues, "I feel very strongly that we need to prayer for the lives of our children and **claim their lives for the Kingdom of God.**  I shared this with our team and many, almost all, wanted to pray and fast.  For a while we've being searching to improve our spiritual work with our children.  After these struggles with a child, we see that it is important to have a space for them to pray.  **We are condensing our offices into one space to create a prayer chapel so our children and youth can have a space to pray and to learn about God.**
Juan Carlos will be helping with the prayer chapel along with Mariela and Norma.  This week we are moving all of their things into my office.  We've made a schedule of those who want to fast and we have decided every day to be praying for our children and for Kaya's ministry.  I feel this is a special time where we truly believe we are giving God the space and time we need for Him in Kaya."

CHURCH PLANTING AND EVANGELISM
**Our priority is to send Park Street Church missionaries to unreached people groups, where there is no church.**

I'm saying they are not directly related, just that there is a difference between "based on" and directly equal, otherwise we are pretty much agreeing lol
the original statement you were arguing against is:


you said they were simply inflation indexed.
All I'm saying is they aren't "simply inflation indexed", but based on.  Including 2 years where no increase was given, one of which didn't what so ever.  As a general rule, it follows inflation, but is not "simply inflation indexed".  if they were, the numbers would match, since they aren't they do not.  It is valid to say they are similar and related, but not equal.  The original poster, you responded to with:


was proposing that we simple tie it to inflation in a 1:1 scenario then old people and the disabled would not be harmed. Instead of what the cola series linked previously indicated in 2010, where the 2nd consecutive year of 0% increase followed a year of 2.7% increase on inflation, that when the $/us economy becomes screwed (see financial crisis) then it's 0% for the disabled and elderly.  So though it may follow the trend of inflation by designed principal, it is by no means tied to it or mandatory.

cold wallet can imply that it's "offline" (a.k.a. has no direct public network exposure), but you can configure two separate computers in a way that isolates the cold storage machine from network exposure, but still allows transaction to be passed directly to offline machine for signing by a cold wallet.  Simply put, Cold storage, doesn't necessarily require you to use "sneaker net" (physically walking the transaction on a usb drive) to have the transaction signed.  You can see this principle in some of the new hardware wallets being presented.  
Hope that clarifies. please feel free to ask more questions if you have them.

I have to point out one thing.  Any computer you visit a website on, has in fact been exposed to the internet.  It is not a proper offline wallet.  That said, it is minimal risk, imo, if you truly trust the website and have a fully patched linux system before the network cable is plugged in.  Otherwise, it's just most likely a secure backup, but never can absolutely be trusted.  Of course, the only way to be certain that you have secured an offline wallet is to create it using local software on an OS that never got plugged in and was properly wiped after the backup is created.   Just had to clarify this.  In most cases my approach is overly paranoid, but I will say there will be posts of how some of these wallets got "hacked" due to use error/careless behaviors.

I do not agree with soliciting funds from an organization that offers funds to charities that are "non-political, secular charities".  It is clearly stated on their website. I find it equivalent to a lie.  I did grow up Lutheran so I do know ELCA is.  I don't find religion offensive, but I do think that charities should not be a vehicle for your own ideals.  Note the fact there **isn't a single purely secular organization in La Paz doing what we do that we are aware of**  . . . perhaps they could use one, but supporting these organizations that aren't secular isn't going to make that happen.
On the part of the chapel . . **it was in the comfort of our staff members daily lives** is not what it was built for. Please see your blog post stating **"We are condensing our offices into one space to create a prayer chapel so our children and youth can have a space to pray and to learn about God"** and "I feel very strongly that we need to prayer for the lives of our children and **claim their lives for the Kingdom of God**"

A close second, possibly more important, problem is scaling bitcoin past 7 Transactions a second. . . . .
then there is the storing the chain with the larger block size once you increase it enough to handle the transaction load. . . . 
Then there comes the question of what kind of hardware will take to assemble a block of that size. . .
[Scalability]( addresses the transactions per second (TPS).  To just handle the daily peak load of visa (4000 TPS).  A full bitcoind node would assemble 2,400,000 transactions every 10 minutes or 14,400,000 an hour.  
Another portion of this is memory utilization and bandwidth.  To just be Visa, 2.4 million transaction with [an average size of 500 bytes]( would use up 1,200,000,000 (around 1 GB) just for the data.  Alone, this doesn't sound like too bad of a deal (we all have more than 1 GB on our desktops, or at least one would hope), but then you account for the amount over time.  A new block ideally occurs every 10 minutes (600 seconds), so with 1.2 billion bytes you are look at just about 2 MB/second incoming and 2 MB/s outgoing times the number of peer nodes you're relaying too.  even with one full node peer this is 4 MB/s. If you have 4 peers, it's 10MB/s.
With 2 MB/s of size growth on the block chain,  that's 7.2 gig per hour or 172.8 gig per day.  In one year of running at this rate, the block chain will have grown 63.072 terra bytes.  I have 14 TB in a raid in my house for crunching numbers, backups and databases. . . and people think that's a lot of storage. As far as networking goes, few people have data plans that would let them relay that much data.  Regardless, this is not consumer level equipment.
**TLDR:** While people say the biggest thing right now is just getting people on board, there are a lot of things that need to move and have to be working to support them.
P.S. I think I pulled that math together correctly, but I had like 6 other tabs open and was flipping them like a mad woman.  Feel free to correct me if I bumbled something.

I don't see them deploying new hardware for existing contracts, though they could, it wouldn't be cost effective.  The new hardware might be viable for issuing new contracts that have lower fees and power usage.
I'm not suggesting they are over charging, I'm just curious what happens when it goes upside down.

@_date: 2014-11-16 21:50:56
It's in the technical level below that.  People think things like "I have 500,000 bits", but that's not technically accurate. What you have is a series of payments (inputs) that were authorized by the originator (payer) to be sent to your address.  Those inputs add up to 500,000 bits.  Conceptually this is the same, but technically quite different.
This becomes evident when you go to spend it.  The wallet gathers enough inputs to cover the amount you are authorizing to be sent to another wallet.  More than likely, there will be some extra amount more than the payment you are making.
Let me break this down a bit, before moving on.  Consider:
**My Hypothetical Wallet**
* 1000 satoshis
* 1000 satoshis
* 2000 satoshis
* 3000 satoshis
Balance is 7000 satoshis.
I make a payment for 5500 satoshis. The wallet then takes enough inputs to cover the amount I'm making a payment for.
**Wallet Transaction**
Inputs for the Transaction:
* 1000 sat
* 2000 sat
* 3000 sat
* &lt;person's addy I'm paying&gt; 5500 sat &lt;--- This is my payment
* &lt;addresss I own&gt; 500 sat &lt;--- This is what people refer to as change
As you see I had to include enough inputs to cover my payment in the transaction, but there is a leftover amount that gets sent back to an address in my wallet.
What I can tell, from a cursory look at what's being discussed, Is that at some point the op had 3 satoshi in change from a payment he made.  That created an input into his wallet that is referred to as "dust". to prevent this (as a temp-ish type fix) type of transaction (too small to be valuable) from bloating the block chain.  The devs implemented a filter that stops any transactions with inputs this small from being propagated to the network, which in turn is keeping it from block inclusion.  
Hope that helps

No.  
MtGox has been hugely irresponsible.  They were irresponsible with their banking in the US.  They were irresponsible with with their scalability in april 2013. The were irresponsible with their fraud prevention now.  
They had our trust.  They WERE the face of bitcoin.  They have squandered that away while raking in the money and watching their system slowly die.  They had plenty of time to fix these issues and they have not.  
It's not even certain at this point how solvent they are.  We know to a degree of certainty they can't cover the USD they still claim to possess.  
They failed to address malleability and secure their own ledgers.  They blamed it publicly on the Bitcoin protocol in a very underhanded manner. They do not deserve leeway.  It took outrage from all sides of the community for them to admit their system was flawed.  You will not convince me they are being honorable and forthcoming.
I hope they go out of business.

Sure Sure, fair question.
It only gets interesting in that the seller and buyer don't have to know each other, they only have to know the oracle.  All they have to do is mutually agree on a price and digitally sign the bitcoin contract.  Oracles will be trusted members and reputations established, not the buyer or the seller.  
In comparison, look at Ebay.  If I'm selling you a car there, the buyer doesn't know if seller has an actual car and seller doesn't know if buyer has the money to pay.  We rely on past behaviors (via ratings) of our peers.  In this system, you can not only process payment and transfer of property in a single fast atomic transaction, but you can also verify assets via the trusted authority and digital signatures.  The legal aspects are off loaded to the Oracle and buyer and can be conducted via the network. 
To bring this back around to the Ebay example.  For titled property, I'd no longer have to trust the seller/buyer, only that ebay is legitimate and competent and that the payment and token of transfer are processed in an atomic transaction.
Now, some of this could be done strictly with the third party, but not as one transaction.  Simplifying this and creating an infrastructure for it to exist also creates a path that could lead to more efficient methods of execution (direct interfaces/oracles to government)
Also, I'm not advocating any of this, just pointing out that it can work within current legal systems and doesn't require that we "boil an ocean".  This also wouldn't be the ideal end implementation, just a transitory path to a better end game.

I doubt they have a way, except maybe after aging/purging old records, since removing your personal information (email, etc) from the account is basically all that need be done and the wallet itself, along with all the transactions made, is forever burned in the blockchain data on the P2P network.

It's not the social security system that caused this in and of itself.  It's the fact the government drew those funds out and left a giant IOU sitting there.   It would be way more solvent than what we see today, if it had been administrated properly.  Instead of used by the government as a piggy bank.  we could probably have easily coasted through until the baby boomers disappeared (since they are causing this upside down pyramid we currently have).

do you know that credit cards take the better part of a month for an "authorization" to become a payment to a vendor and are reversible?  Yet, they are the most common form of payment used in the first world.  This currency is a digital hybrid of currency that behaves partially like a credit card (authorization is the digital signing of a transaction and confirmation is the card processing service visa, mastercard, etc paying a vendor).  For 95% of the transaction in the world this is a non-issue.  If you're buying a house, boat or other large property, waiting an hour or so shouldn't be a big deal anyhow. In person transactions also give the you advantage of having the opportunity of identity verification, if you are worried about high value/risk items

This is the same stupidity and lack of even short term (less than a year) insight into emerging technologies.  Sorry for being harsh, but this 5 day view of the world caused a lot of panic sells last April and a lot of people who bought at 260, sold for a loss.  They listened to all the hype and FUD. There is no loss until you sell something or the asset is completely destroyed.  If you don't believe in it's longer term viability, you shouldn't be buying BTC at all.  Right now your looking at a good discount, if it goes down some more, it's a better discount.  Again, unless you think the asset is worthless. Otherwise, your just day trade gambling on it, which will lead you to ruin every time.  There are 3 uses for BTC:
* Buy and save
* Transmit Money
* Buying goods

I never ruled anything out.  I said buy the coin and do 1 of 3 things with it.  I said you should never sell for less than you paid for it.  I implied that if your coming into it, you should accept the risks.  I said historically the people that panic sell unnecessarily lose money every time.  If your investing in something (not buying for immediate transmission or purchasing goods) you need to accept the risk of investment and take a profit approach.  A few days of a dip is hardly anything but a panic sell.  In fact, today, it's back at 700 again.  If your investing, in my opinion (not financial advise), you should always accept risk, invest what you can afford, and don't sell at lower price until you can verify a long term downward trend.
As far as "Discount" works, if you were willing to buy at a thousand and still have money to invest at 500. Why would you not purchase 2:1 over your previous investment?  An example of this, when the mortgage collapse happened,  we had a partial investment in our portfolio for a bank.  We looked at our stock it was dropping.  We ask ourselves is this company going to close?  The answer for us was no.  Things were unclear as to how it would resolve, so we held.  The U.S. government announced it was going to inject funding into the banking system. We looked at the stock price it was super low because of market panic.  We moved 1/4 of our portfolio over to it.  We had a 5 fold increase in our investment portfolio during one of the worst economic times in recent history. This is what I mean by discount and why I quoted hitchhiker's guide to the galaxy.

When I was younger everything was cash.  There were lots of places a credit card couldn't be used.  I remember Mc Donalds finally started accepting them, everybody was all excited! Now I can't remember the last thing I bought with cash.  I haven't written a check in years.  Bitcoin seems to be a natural evolution in payment.  
When I first got on the internet there weren't even many images available (if at all).  Then animated gifs were huge. (anybody remember all the obnoxious spinning gifs?) I see this as the beginning of a global payment system, just like email being the beginning of messaging.
I think a lot of people forget it wasn't that long ago all the phones had cords.  I find a lot of these arguments without a perspective of history.
Oh, and about the credit card thing. it takes days, if not weeks, or longer for a charge to go from authorized to a sellers bank account.  14 minutes (even though every transaction I've had fees included on was no more than a few minutes) isn't that long.
