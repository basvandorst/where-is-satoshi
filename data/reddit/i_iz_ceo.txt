Zencontroler is useless, can we file a lawsuit because they said it does or will do x,y, and z but it does nothing ( 1 click pool switching, updates, etc.) . It doesn't even work... Also Eric and Mr. Ceo stated that Eric was in Texas, it seems like he is at Mr. Ceo's house parties, and who is Eric? Where is he from? And how can he turn on accounts in 24 hours when Gaw was in Ct. and Eric was in Texas?  Now that Gavin Andresen is asking questions Mr. Ceo will stop selling hashlets soon, boo-hoo... Gavin, THANKS FOR DOING THE RIGHT THING (asking a simple question)!! 
For the people still drinking the KOOL-AID, drink it all up!

The idiots claim that you wrote an article on On November 22, 2104, how the fuck do they do this, have a crystal ball? Coinfire do not write an article in 90 years.
edit liquor and Reddit don't mix.

His threat is lets make a deal, some threat.
@_date: 2014-11-26 00:32:21
Bingo, a person that has dealt with them ^^ would know this. :)

Stick with BTC and you will be safer. This company is.....
Red flags since they stopped selling miners and went into this fiasco, as noted by some very respected people in the BTC community.
Glad you got refunded too :)
@_date: 2014-11-06 09:38:24
You said you will go see the data center like 3-4 months ago? No?
Another question, have you received money from Gaw, their forum and/or its members there?
Are you asking for more donations on their forum now? 
OK BYE..
@_date: 2014-12-06 22:37:19

Great job Coinfire, I know more will come out from you guys, he has done everything to try and stop you guys from reporting.

badbitcoins? LOL they are getting paid from this scam

It is common for Gaw to close tickets, without fixing the problem. 
@_date: 2015-01-04 04:59:47
LOL shill boy to the rescue.
@_date: 2015-01-02 14:42:23
I did not screen it but I think the thread is still there. 
@_date: 2015-01-02 13:07:14
3 minutes? it was more like 12 seconds or less. I hope you make up for it. Happy New Year to you and everyone here.
Edit: I did read your post on there, your friendly friend redacted contacted pcfan to ban you, sorry.
@_date: 2015-01-02 14:12:12
this is on paybase
"Save 10% at Amazon, Target, &amp; more with PaySave"
@_date: 2015-01-02 15:44:32
AND ITS GONE! 
I just went nuts looking for it, sorry I did not archive it as I did with many other posts. :(
@_date: 2015-01-24 09:37:31
Welcome back Mike :). Is there a way you can prove that your domain did not expire to the domain registrar, maybe show them proof with the receipt to get it back? Happy to see you back online and please keep us updated.
@_date: 2015-01-20 07:36:22
LOL Time to clean house! The ban hammer has been working nonstop. All the mods are in the corner hiding with hammers out. PCFAN, CYBERLIZARD... For MAURSADER I will make a missing poster, with reward.
@_date: 2015-01-04 07:04:33
Sorry, that page doesn’t exist!
@_date: 2015-01-04 06:19:42
I can see the servers reddit uses getting overloaded just from this thread.
Next post on HT from CEO:
See, we crashed Reddit!
@_date: 2015-01-06 08:12:49
Suchmoons post has some very nice proof how he started thinking of the idea.
@_date: 2015-01-02 14:05:32
How about we get Josh to come here as an Amazon employ and confirm that paybase is partnered with Amazon?  
@_date: 2015-01-25 05:43:27
Hope it works out, Good Luck and happy to see much support for Coinfire!
@_date: 2015-01-04 04:44:00
He has done much damage, he ran a bot that flooded the site we archived all the comments CEO made. 
@_date: 2015-01-04 07:44:48
You should be honored!! You were mentioned in that thread, Congratz!
@_date: 2015-01-06 14:50:26
That is Josh's account on the KNC forum. Josg21 was the name he used on many sites, bitcointalk 
 
twitter  etc.
This is exactly what he did, what he accused KNC of doing.
EDIT, he is deleting almost everything as we speak, new forum etc but a lot is archived.
@_date: 2015-01-02 15:16:50
That is him, it was exposed a while ago on suchmoons thread, there are pics of him on there where he is putting gridseeds together
I guess he removed the pics from the forum.
EDIT X2
Yep thats his account, glad its saved.
@_date: 2015-01-02 14:02:08
he tweeted them by accident.
@_date: 2015-01-02 17:32:20
He was asking these questions before there was any competition, this was before he was a re-seller, but when people started asking the same questions about his mining operation, he shut them down/banned FAST. 
@_date: 2015-01-02 19:15:56
Excellent job, by the time you are finished it might be about 20 pages long. :)
@_date: 2015-01-02 15:27:46
@_date: 2015-04-17 15:34:14
Great work and find! Keep exposing this fraud.
