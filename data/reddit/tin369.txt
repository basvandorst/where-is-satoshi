so do you guys use gadx or coinbase? what happens when the bitcoin arrives in your wallet. Is it safe to store it in coinbase? can you store it in gdax? any other wallet? how do you cash out?

So is it limit or stop order where if I set it to buy when it for e.g. goes to $16500. 
How much btc would I know if I only want to buy $100 worth.

Thanks for the great explanation, i don't want to day trade, and I just learned about bitcoin a few weeks ago, and I like the idea behind it. so I want to HODL, but just wanted to make sure, if the strategy is to buy until you accumulate something significant to you and then you transfer it to a physical wallet to keep it secure. I think you answered my question.
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:03:43
thanks for your answer, and is that what is called "the wall" and what should I be looking for when I am looking at the chart? is this an indicator to predict how the prices will behave?
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:51:54
What are the red and green numbers on the Gdax site, it keeps fluctuating.
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:54:43
can you buy directly from gdax and what wallet to store it in?
@_date: 2017-12-20 11:39:21
And between trezor and ledger nano s, you guys would recommend the nano s right?
Any desktop wallet that I can use in the meantime that is easy safe and secure?
@_date: 2017-12-18 12:07:52
Prices in the us are showing around $360 for Trezor. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 11:43:43
Are both of these available on Amazon? How much? Do they store all three coins?
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:44:29
why does coinbase put a weekly limit to how much you can buy? mine is really low only $1000, can this limit be increased?
@_date: 2017-12-19 10:46:45
Why is Coinbase showing $18400 for me and in binance it’s $16,449. Same for other coins showing high on Coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:13:11
can you explain the differences between limit orders and market orders? Also can you sue Bitcoin to buy eth or litecoin or using USD better?
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:56:32
ok great, so I should see it in my account after a week, does that include weekends? 7 business days?
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:36:36
What alts?
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:50:13
can you elaborate a bit for me, so I buy let's say $100 worth of bitcoin and eth and litecoin, once its in my coinbase wallet, I am to transfer it to my physical wallet? so this needs to be done everytime I buy, once it shows up in coinbase I keep transferring? is this process free of fees? what happens when I need to sell bitcoin, I have to transfer it back to coinbase from my wallet to sell correct? this looks very inconvenient.
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:04:42
When I go to place order with stop order it gives me a warning saying it may execute at a less favorable price? What does it mean?
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:00:03
I still haven't been verified in coinbase, it juts gives me verification failed message. How good are these physical wallets?
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:50:08
 Is it limit order or stop order
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:03:01
I have binance account but can I use buy btc on binance using usd?
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:48:42
how long did it take for your limit to increase to 15k?
@_date: 2017-12-20 11:14:01
Which wallet to transfer from gdax? Ledger Nano S in Amazon is from 3rd parties I m not comfortable buying it from them. Also lols like they are selling for a higher price. Should I order from the company directly or is there any other place I can buy it from? 
In the meantime how do I get coins out of Coinbase and binance?
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:13:14
I just created a coinbase account and bought some btc, the money is out of my bank account but its not showing up on my coinbase app, does it take this longer for everyone? 
Also, tried uploading my drivers license, but verification failed message is what I get. 
Do you guys link your bank account, credit card or have it deposited on coinbase and then buy.
Also, is the strategy still buy at dips and hold? when can you sell it? once it shows up in your wallet? is coinbase the only place you can buy and sell?
@_date: 2017-12-16 12:47:53
This is good and dandy, but as someone new to cyrtocurrency I am really surprised how hard the whole world of cryptocurrency is. coinbase is the only app i found the easiest that the masses can use and understand. everything else is built for nerds. I am sorry, but until they can make it easy for the masses, I don't see how this could be the future of currencies. 
If I need to buy btc from one place, chapatti it another, move it a wallet etc, is too much steps and process that will turn a lot of people off.
I really hope that in 2018 there is more innovation and companies can streamline the process.
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:22:23
any reason why my document verification keeps getting failed?
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:18:18
New here, what does usdt mean
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:08:43
so right now, if i am reading the chart right there are less than 400 btc left to be sold looking at the red wall in the depth chart and less than 270 orders placed
@_date: 2017-12-14 18:28:12
thanks again for responding and providing the info, this makes sense and that is what I intend to do, buy when it dips and then collect and transfer once there is enough like a $1000 worth or something, I know it may not be much for someone. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 15:39:14
so if me and my spouse have bitcoins and litecoins, we both will need two different physical wallets? what happens when each year a new wallet comes out, do you just transfer from the older to the newer one? This sounds complicated. any youtube videos out there which explains how to use a physical wallet.
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:29:49
What is causing it to go up so rapidly? Also bought at an high and then exchanged it for ether, would I hold the ether or trade it for bitcoin. I am a noob.
