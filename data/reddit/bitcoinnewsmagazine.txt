When scrypt.cc finally implodes that should be the kiss of death for badbitcoin.org.

Comparing HaoBTC to the ponzi run by pirateat40 is not very helpful. HaoBTC is one of the largest bitcoin mining operations in China and pays their investors a fair interest rate for keeping bitcoin in their wallet at HaoBTC. Bitcoin can be withdrawn at any time.

[gpg4usb]( is all you need really. Easy to use, full documentation and generates 4096 bit RSA keys.

Will KeepKey work with Mycelium on Android same as Trezor?
@_date: 2015-09-11 03:45:15
I have both Trezor and Ledger and give the edge to Trezor. Both now work with Mycelium on Android. Trezor does feel cheap due to the plastic, something which KeepKey should correct.
Edit: KeepKey now ships for $239 which is a surprise. Trezor may be plastic but you can buy two Trezors and have change for dinner for the price of one KeepKey. Also KeepKey does not yet work with smartphones.

Trezor Support: "This is a matter of displaying new transactions in MyTrezor which might be connected to non-standard conditions in the Bitcoin network spammed by a lot of incoming transactions. We are already looking into the issue and we will fix it as soon as possible."

If you want to spend $239 for a KeepKey that does not even work with Android yet go for it. $100 for a Trezor now looks like a bargain eh?

Trezor needs to address this right away. My outgoing transactions are still unconfirmed in mytrezor.com here after a dozen confirmations on blockchain.info. Is there a problem with the latest firmware update?

We ordered a Case to review as soon as offered for sale and have not received tracking yet, so they are taking their time shipping. An email to Melanie just got a cut and paste response that shipping will continue into last week of September. We did get another email that there are some minor bugs with the unit that will be worked out with a firmware update.

Browse the article see what you think. Point and Figure charting is a very powerful technical analytics tool, more so because not everyone is using it and it gave a long term buy for bitcoin when price closed above $8600.
