This isn't really that much of a breakthrough. Also keep in mind it is incredibly expensive to make a 14nm chip. The odds that the ROI will be feasible at this TDP/tech for the price, is highly unlikely.

there is a timer in the top right. let it finish. i think its in response to  ad-block.

i don't think so

Most of the people in the video besides the dude from DR look like they don't know what they are talking about. I'm not saying that the guy was informative, but at least he understood what was happening.
That being said, they kept saying the chips would be "smaller and lighter." No one gives a shit how light the chip is. That is the most irrelevant information about the asic. OBVIOUSLY it is better, but only because we expect a lower wattage being used. It was only toward the end that they even mentioned the power.
Also, with the 14nm processor, it seems that it is still comparable to the Bitmaintech Antminer S7.
For a new miner to be significant at this point, we need between 3-5TH at about 600-850 Watts. Otherwise the technology already exists and there is nothing to get excited about.

I was actually going to buy one of these before I saw this.

I hope you understand that was a reason to **not** do what you are saying.

If all of the space-time continuum was filled with asics, then yes, you would want them separated a little bit because it would get a little hot.

ethereum has a better algorithm with opencl. sha256 is too basic.

mining hardware has finally hit a plateau with bitcoin mining. 16/14nm Chips have just become commercially available, however the technology has been in large-scale bitcoin mining farms already.
This same 16/14nm technology has just been made commercially available by NVIDIA and AMD for GPUs. The difference being that GPUs are an actually product that have a use besides mining. 
The next place for Bitcoin manufacturers to go would be a 6nm-10nm chip. This won't be released for at least 3-6 years from NVIDIA/AMD, where ASIC manufacturers may see a technology jump in 2-4 years (possibly sooner).
The reason ASIC (bitcoin) manufactures can develop their technology faster is because SHA256 chips is less complicated. They only do one thing.
Cryptocurrencies that mimic more complicated, practical algorithms (ethereum) will be the future of cryptocurrencies. Because OpenCL is widely used for desktop and server computing, the development of technology for mining hardware correlates with the demand of the other uses of the high speed hardware (gaming, app development, etc.)
What to look out for would be new cryptocurrencies that utilize OpenGL, Mantle, or Vulkan computing languages. These are more complicated algos than OpenCL, and will have even smaller jumps in mining technology than Ethereum or bitcoin due to their complexity and requirement of dedicated computing.
OpenGL, Mantle, and Vulkan are all open source, and anyone can develop for them. 
many people will argue that the DAO separates Ethereum from other cryptos. This is true, but in my opinion, not really a selling point because no average user even understands what the DAO is. I think Ethereum is popular because it puts the power back in the average miners hands. AMD users get serious returns from their hardware. 
The DAO has been a serious vulnerability for Ethereum for the last few months. There is also very limited support for Ethereum and it is not as reliable as a wallet in terms of UX and software development. Only recently has there been significant developments in wallet interface and compatibilities. Basically, Ethereum isn't really as user-friendly as bitcoin. 
I suspect that there will be a new crypto that comes along and will compensate for the inadequacies of ethereum and bitcoin. Ethereum is a better crypto but doesn't have a lot of the support it needs within the development community. That and the community is a little hostile. I love enthusiasm, but i do not think it is a very inclusive culture.
