I'm not so optimist in that happening just by the nature of cryptocurrency and how the US government gravitates towards China-like policies in the digital realm (mass surveillance, increasing censorship, manipulation of propaganda, etc).


I mean, people still get high, but the collateral damage is there, and drug users don't have access to consumer protection, quality product, easy access, etc. Besides they are threatened with jail. And you don't have to be a tech person to use drugs. Money loses value as less people use that money, and crypto gets weakened as it loses value.
I'm not saying cryptocurrency is gonna fail, but we shouldn't be so relaxed about the authoritarian laws that some people are cooking. 
@_date: 2017-01-24 05:57:57
You don't get it. Yeah, some people still would find a way to use it, and it probably will have some use in the black markets, but very little people would use it. The market cap would get smaller, and with it the  incentive for some miners, making the network even more vulnerable. Most potential for cryptocurrency would be lost, but maybe you find some comfort in thinking that cryptocurrency is invincible and we shouldn't worry about what the authorities do.
@_date: 2017-01-24 07:12:02
A lot of that volume would collapse if Chine outlaws cryptocurrency, and if one major government starts doing it, it could start a domino effect and making a lot of governments do the same. Once the precedent is in the mainstream, lot of people in power which feel threatened by cryptocurrency would try to put its criminalization as a good policy and they will join forces to push that agenda. Just see what happened with drugs. The war on drugs is global and that didn't even threatened bankers.

Nice, then it's likely that your investments are spot on 


Maybe by only investing in Bitcoin "the one true cryptocurrency", you could miss out from good investments again
@_date: 2017-01-24 01:54:19
Well, you just make illegal to make any transaction of criptocurrency in exchange for something else. There are some legislators [trying to do it with weed in Washington]( already, which would really suck for the cannabis industry there. The utility of cryptocurrency for the weed industry would be gone and a big market would leave with it. Now, iterate with more goods and services, and cryptocurrency will be crippled, just being useful in a very little economy, and we will be stuck with fiat and an authoritarian government. If cryptocurrency has any future, the community has to protect it with a legal approach and not only technical.

Thanks and good luck too!

Really? I didn't got that impression from reading the article. They appear to be talking about making manuals and guides for people in order for them to comply with the current complexity of tax law. Nothing about simplification


@_date: 2016-11-28 10:59:49
It can be done, and it's done in cryptos like Monero
@_date: 2016-11-14 23:17:21
Yep. That would be basically lowering the consensus threshold of 95% that Bitcoin Core so passionately defends, and effectively pushing the miners that don't agree with SegWit to fork into a separate blockchain. It would be interesting seeing two Bitcoin chains co-exists. That would give more robustness to the ecosystem, since we would have two implementations to choose from, and if any of the two was actually bad, we would have the other
Edit: even although I say that it would give more robustness to the ecosystem having two Bitcoin implementations, I said it only in contrast with the current civil war and stagnation. I think the ideal path always is reach consensus and find a solution that makes everyone happy and keep the community together, since together is easier to prevail
@_date: 2016-11-07 22:25:54
I would appreciate that, thanks!
@_date: 2016-11-27 08:55:41
This is really cool! Just don't forget that even Bitcoin is very experimental software and could fail. So, try to diversify and read the news once in a while to know what's going on, and be informed enough to take action if needed, just like you would probably do if you think a company is taking wrong steps, and you would manage your stocks to protect yourself

Yes, but even if you only lost the transactions of the last day, that would cause a lot of chaos. Plus, we are talking about a man that created an interdimensional portal gun. So, if you wanna argue that Rick couldn't actually invent his portal gun in real life, stop arguing about fiction and go to actually invent something.
@_date: 2017-04-03 05:18:56
If you think about it, it is not absurd. Rick could have erased all the servers keeping track of the transactions, and then setting the entire supply as 0 instead of 1 (we can assume that 1 is just a way of representing total supply, like 100%). So, now suddenly everyone has 0 money in their accounts, and there aren't any records of who owns what. Total chaos.
Edit: And there could be other possible explanations. Rick and Morty is a really smart show. Just don't complain if the creators don't actually know how to develop an interdimensional portal gun.
@_date: 2017-04-30 03:58:19
Representative government is a failure, not democracy. For any middleman there is a node where corruption can happen. We need a far more direct democracy and government transparency. Plus securing individual freedoms which can't do much damage, unlike big corporations/institutions/etc that can do a lot of damage just because they are big and their actions have bigger repercussions.
@_date: 2017-04-07 10:05:58
I'm not looking for ASIC-proof. And you're making big ambiguos and unargumentative claims, like:


@_date: 2017-04-03 06:11:29
Why couldn't you? We are talking about a centralized database of a Galactic Federation. Chances all records are digital are pretty high.
@_date: 2017-04-03 07:58:19
Yeah, sure. Let's assume the Galactic Federation is smart enough to keep backups, just like the Council of Ricks is smart enough to not having stupid vulnerabilities in their base, like not having enough checks and balances before teleporting the entire base to anywhere in the universe, right?
It is not my belief that what I described is the actual explanation to what Rick did. I'm just pointing out that it is not incoherent with the Rick and Morty universe. I'm not arrogant enough to claim I know the plot better than the writers of the show, and they couldn't actually make sense of what Rick just did.
@_date: 2017-04-30 06:55:06


I literally said:


So any of your worries was instantly nullified from the beginning. Even your 51% assumption is wrong. A healthier democracy won't even consider 51% as a good consensus and we could increase the threshold to something less polarised, like 2/3.
True tyranny comes when people does not have a platform to communicate and develop a common agenda, and some dark minorities are making decisions at the expense of the suffering of millions. If we are to suffer because life is hard, then at least we should be able to take part in the direction of our future.
We need consensus in the societal protocol in order to have the more frictionless and efficient protocol.
@_date: 2017-04-03 07:27:28
What the fuck are you talking about? We are not even talking about the dollar, Rick attacked the Galactic Federation, not the USA.

But implementing these particular changes would not be really pushing for ASIC-resistance, since those would not level the play-field between CPU, GPU, and ASICs. These changes would only cripple one particular optimization. It's not a technical solution, but a political move against certain miners, without helping people which wanna more flexibility in mining Bitcoin with multiple kinds of hardware.
@_date: 2017-04-07 01:50:44
You're totally right. That's why I don't believe in this targeting of optimizations.
@_date: 2017-04-30 04:01:54
Finding consensus is difficult, but we need to try.
@_date: 2017-04-06 01:55:09
The real problem is Bitcoin not being ASIC-resistant. If the Bitcoin community doesn't care about ASIC-resistance, stop bitching when someone develops an ASIC that performs better than everyone else's.
@_date: 2016-09-23 08:09:19
But you wouldn't be able to delete transactions, just data within transactions that has nothing to do with the protocol. I mean, the first time I read "Editable Blockchain" I also thought that it was a really absurd thing, but then I thought about this scenario and it doesn't seem so absurd now... (If they mean something like this of course)
@_date: 2016-09-23 05:29:01
What about a blockchain where people publish posts, but the authors of a post are able to delete it if they want?
@_date: 2016-09-23 06:48:37
But if you want to have an integrated coin to incentivize miners to support the network in which the data is stored and backed up in a robust way, you would need the blockchain, wouldn't you?
@_date: 2016-10-22 09:13:29
But assuming **B** does not have more funds than those mentioned, **B** would be forced to close at least its channel with **A** in order for **B** to have enough funds to open a new channel with **C** to send it **1 BTC**. So, **B** would be losing liquidity for participating as an intermediary between **A** and **C**
@_date: 2016-10-18 18:18:16
I think that any major nation has enough computational power to make a 51% attack on Bitcoin, but the incentive to do it just had not been there, and governments probably would avoid to do something like that and would prefer to suffocate cryptocurrency by over-regulating it and other subtle actions (like incriminating cryptocurrency leaders and prosecuting them). I believe that the only way to secure cryptocurrency's future is to gain wide population adoption and support.

And american citizens urge to the american government to stop being so abusive... Seriously, how could you possible justify taxing income not generated in your country? Your infrastructure is not being used at all, and most of the revenue is coming from foreign capital, WTF?
If anything, you are just punishing your citizens for doing business outside of the country, because they have to pay taxes to more than one government. This is so wrong...
@_date: 2016-10-22 10:20:30


Correct. The overall liquidity remains the same, but still, imagine opening you Lighting wallet to sent some funds to an address and encountering that you can't because your balances are now all messed up, despite having the same amount of money and overall liquidity.

I don't see any problem with people believing in something, pushing for it to happen, and being rewarded in the process. Even less of a problem if your are ADDING options instead of RESTING them. Any advance in freedom is welcome.

The problem in blockchain is spam is forever. Imagine attacks that generate 128 MB blocks. That would be a huge burden for every full node forever.
I like the automatic scaling of Monero that let the block size grow as demand grows, but make it very expensive to make the blocks grow, and if demand shrinks, block size start reducing again.

In a democracy "the best option" is the option most people agree on, period.
But any healthy democracy would accept the existence of certain human rights, which not even the majority can take away from you.
Government opacity shouldn't be a thing. Every public agency should be under permanent public auditing.

You are on point. Wouldn't be nice to actually care about what pushes people into being criminals (usually despair or a life where crime seemed like the natural path to follow), and trying to help them to readapt to society, instead of shitting all over them and making them even more dangerous criminals? But no, we need revenge and thinking that people deserve to suffer for not being like us, without any kind of empathy or an integral social analysis.
So, let's cheer those politicians who want even more power to abuse it.

He seems reacting more to the annoying host's interruptions, than to whatever Wright was saying.
Besides this was before anyone pointed at Wright as Satoshi, including himself, so it's unlikely Szabo thought Wright was insinuating he was Satoshi.

Mass surveillance can do almost nothing against terrorism. Even if we have people monitoring each camera, how could they prevent that a guy suddenly starts running over people, or stabbing them with a broken glass bottle? And usually this attackers get shot dead in the crime scene, so all the footage of they committing these crimes don't even have value to convict terrorists, since there is no trial.
But all these footage, espionage and cyber-weapons can be used to bully any citizen and construct a criminalizing narrative for almost anyone, who seems like a threat for those in power. Especially when some legislators want to cut freedom even more, putting you in prison for some edgy tweet or for using encryption without the official encryption software with the government backdoor.
So, fuck off. Terrorism does not justify mass surveillance and more authority to the government.

It could be because he wanted to make it impossible to prove he was Satoshi, but didn't want people completely rule out he was Satoshi.
I mean, that way he could have that mystery around him forever, and could calm his ego down, preventing him from being tempted to reveal himself to have the recognition he deserved.
