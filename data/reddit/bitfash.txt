Many thanks for your observations. We absorb the cost of doing business and don't factor it into the sales price. As you will see, we are offering Zara and Forever21 at their list prices - no mark up. Bitfash.com enables you use Bitcoins and realise the value in these at Zara and Forever21 and for that, we charge a transaction fee.
