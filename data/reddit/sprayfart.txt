Norway has a wealth fund valued to about 1,3 trillion USD. Is that enough to buy all the bitcoins in the world?

There is no future for bitcoin in 10, 15, 20 years if it stay decentralized and anonymous. Too many criminals, terrorists and conmen are using it. Cryptocurrency has a future, but not without more centralization. A world currency maintained and governed by UN is probably what you would see mainstream in 10,15,20 years, not bitcoin.

The internet isnt decentralized and anonymous, so your comparison is void. However, there are ways to utilize internet as a platform for anonymous communications and payments like bitcoin and thats the problem, when we have ISIS and Mexican drug cartels using it as a means to hide from law enforcement and justice. Thats the problem. Terrorists using the platform of internet to communicate anonymous is one issue, which with good intelligence can be countered easy. Finance, which is the fundamental fuel for any group or person wanting to do evil or criminal activity is a much bigger issue and thats why bitcoin in its current form will not succeed long term as you proposing. The devs need to approach the UN and set up a sensible and democratic system, with voting rights for each countries and a consensus on development. Something like ICANN. Cryptocurrency will come, but not bitcoin in its current state im sorry.
and pardon my bad english!
