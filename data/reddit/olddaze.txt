Great idea!

Your dad should have:
a) Not invested what he wasn't willing to lose
b) If he lost the investment, not blame his son
c) Not be stupid enough to invest in something without researching it himself
d) Treated the money he gave you to invest as a gift, not something which would double, "guaranteed" 
tldr: your dad is retarded

Cool - that's what I was attempting to ask with this post. Do you know of any merchants off the top of your head? I was having trouble finding some, which is why I made the reddit post. Thanks

No one will sell you bitcoin through Paypal because you (or any other buyer) can easily file to reverse the transaction and the seller is then screwed out of their bitcoins.

I do see your point - what I meant was from the gist of my post is that I didn't want to treat BTC as an investment and way to get more fiat, but as an actual alternative currency for buying some of my groceries. I guess the infrastructure isn't in place yet for this to be feasible as it does require a million steps and doesn't seem to be worth it.

You can make them yourself from bitcoinpaperwallet.com! Super easy to make!

It won't be worth the electricity you're spending to power your computer while mining. Sorry 
@_date: 2013-04-09 06:48:53
Hi I'm around what's your suggestion?
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:09:42
I posted this before I saw it was $50 dollars.I thought the son had convinced his dad to put in $1000+ and now the Dad was mad he lost his money and was blaming the son and needed him to pay him back. Also, why would grounding the son be parenting done right? 
The son already learned the lesson - he lost his money.

What's a tipjar?
@_date: 2013-04-09 06:12:54
Thanks for the info, appreciate it! 
@_date: 2013-12-21 20:47:35
Sorry, these are for friends and family offline. You can buy bitcoins in fractions, you don't have to buy a whole bitcoin. I'm sure you'd be able to find a few bucks you can turn into bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-12-22 07:32:41
Nope, I used regular printer paper. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 18:27:40
I'm confused, why are they lost?
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:35:25
Then (in my opinion) my original post stands. He shouldn't be blaming you for giving him bad investment advice. He should have done his own research. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 13:53:03
According to this guys post history he works at a major ISP and stole wallets from clients emails. A real great guy. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:11:01
What did he mean by "Sorry, I'm all out!"? lol. Did he just take your money and run? Reverse that shit!
@_date: 2013-12-21 20:52:48
I realized my title might be a little ambiguous, unfortunately these are presents for friends and family and I can't give them out to you guys. Sorry!! :(
@_date: 2013-12-03 19:56:07
Hope you're tipping outside or where people will use it as a method to find out about bitcoin! Only downside is that people begin to beg for tips...
@_date: 2013-12-21 20:46:03
I can see how someone might think this is a bad gift. For the people I'm giving it too I've been talking about bitcoin to them for a while and they've all expressed interest so I'm hoping they'll appreciate it. 
Edit: Also, if you're the type of person who would be pissed over a charity donation as a gift, also remember that you could always take the bitcoins given and immediately sell them on an exchange. For the people I'm giving these to they know about exchanges but I'm including instructions on how to convert these to fiat. Mostly though I'm trying to give them examples of how they can spend the bitcoins online for goods and services just like dollars but easier!

I laughed so hard, what is a jellybean
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:26:01
Honestly mate don't do it. You will get scammed. If you want to get rid of them go to a trading website and sell them for easily $100 each coin! I would easily buy one bit coin for $85 but would feel bad as you wouldn't be getting your money's worth. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 03:07:08
Hey Ilsensine, 
I'm curious on how you generated the BIP38 key pair. I just googled around and was a bit confused - if you have any resources you could send me towards I'd be super grateful!
@_date: 2013-04-09 06:12:40
Thanks, appreciate it!
@_date: 2013-04-08 23:47:37
Nothing loads!
@_date: 2013-04-09 05:31:16
:( yeah always annoying... so the best bet is just to wait and buy with Cash? I was hoping there'd be a service where I could almost pay for some like a credit/debit card type transaction. Thanks for letting me know!
@_date: 2013-04-08 23:16:26
Dang it. I was going to go to the bank today and buy my first bitcoins, even got my wallet all set up offline and I couldn't make it until it was already closed. Now I won't be able to say I got into Bitcoins before they hit $200 :(
@_date: 2013-04-15 05:14:52
Thanks! appreciate it
@_date: 2013-04-08 23:33:55
I feel the exact same way man, me and a friend were looking at bitcoin over the summer and they were super cheap. Now we are kicking ourselves for not doing anything!
@_date: 2013-11-30 03:52:41
Figured it out man! haha
@_date: 2013-11-19 13:47:38
It's funny because April 12 I bought bitcoins... And sold on the 13 for half price :( haha
@_date: 2013-12-21 23:26:48
Nope! Just to the ones who I've gauged to have an interest in them and would appreciate it. The rest get more personalized gifts. 
@_date: 2013-12-21 18:31:50
Unfortunately these are all accounted for by friends and family offline....maybe next time!
@_date: 2013-11-30 03:52:52
It was a confusion with my IRC client. :)
@_date: 2013-04-09 01:04:26
Here's a better idea if someone sends me 1 bitcoin I promise I will send them .05 bitcoins. GUARANTEED ^GUARANTEED^GUARANTEED^GUARANTEED^GUARANTEED

I used the website bitcoinpaperwallet.com and they had a holiday template! I wish I could take credit for the design as it's really well done haha
@_date: 2013-04-09 01:33:08
Very nice to a complete noob like me. Cheers! 
@_date: 2013-04-13 00:19:16
How does something like this happen? I'm confused. 
@_date: 2013-11-17 23:15:24
Just to clarify, I won't be using my entire food budget, it's just what I feel comfortable risking for my 'experiment'. I'd like to be able to put this money into bitcoin and still spend it on food, just by using bitcoin instead of USD. I'm not trying to put in 250 and then pull out 500 or something in a chance to double my investment.
@_date: 2013-04-15 02:00:47
PMd thanks a lot man!
@_date: 2013-04-09 16:52:40
Only you can determine when to sell. You need to think if it's worth transferring into a fiat currency, (such as you need the money to spend on things that don't accept bitcoin yet), or you want to wait. I suggest taking a long time to think about what you'd like to do as only you know your own finances. 
If I was you, I'd take about half my bitcoins and convert them to USD, so I could use that with things that don't accept bitcoins. The other half I'd use to keep and spend on services that accept bitcoins, but that's because I like the idea behind bitcoin and want to see it grow into something more then just a pump-n-dump investment that many think it is. 
Hope this helps.
@_date: 2013-11-30 03:24:45
Cheers man!
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:07:48
Yeah this is just stupid, I can easily picture some guy sitting behind his computer laughing about how "HE TROLLED DEM"
This immediately came to mind:
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:59:36
I agree with you. The way the OP is stating the money is confusing (is it the dad's money, or is it the dad giving the son a loan?). If the dad told the son he was giving him a loan, then yes, the son should be held responsible for the outcome, better or worse. But if the son was saying "Oh you should invest in Bitcoin!" and then the dad uses his own money to invest and it crumbles, he shouldn't hold the son accountable for giving him bad advice.
