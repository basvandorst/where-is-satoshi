Wow great TA. Just bought 100k

We've been in a parallel downward channel for the past month. Bitcoin switches between uptrends and downtrends on a roughly monthly cycle. We're also approaching a major trendline around 7k that has been confirmed 4 times since November 2017. Most likely scenario is a natural bounce off 7k to topside. Always a possibility somebody is waiting to dump the market at a critical point for a short.

We've got a large chance of something eventually happening here.

That's not how it works. Shorting with leverage makes you able to profit more when the price goes down.

What did you use to calculate one year? Seems pretty specific. This would be better if it said "Just relax. You know why? Because the price of Bitcoin will maybe eventually be higher". Bullish.

ACH takes 3-5 business days... and tends to carry over to the next week.

Shorting with leverage they can just keep dumping the price and making absurd amounts of money. Price doesn't matter when you have enough influence.

If you're unable to find a way around this then buy a hardware wallet and they solve that problem for you.

It doesn't matter what the price of BTC is. You need to tether before it drops and buy back when it does. Rinse and repeat, causing your USD value to remain the same. Learn how to actually trade alt coins based on volume and liquidity. It sounds like you don't know what you're doing when it comes to trading. I suggest you learn TA and other market fundamentals to become a good trader or just stop before you burn away all your money. You either master the market or it masters you. If you buy and wait then it drops more it sounds like you're gambling instead of making a well rounded choice based on analysis.

Let's say BTC is worth $10k USD. An alt coin is worth 0.5 BTC = $5k USD. BTC drops to $9k (-10%) meaning that even if the BTC value of the alt coin remains at 0.5 BTC then it is worth less in USD at $4.5k (-10%). So if the USD price of BTC drops then the alt coin will drop unless the alt coins price grows to an equal or greater percentage of the BTC drop. It really just depends on what part of a market cycle the alt coin is in. As BTC becomes more bullish, alt coins become less dependent on BTC price.

Same people who say tether is a scam never question their fractional reserve bank accounts

Draws 4 straight lines with only volume indicator and has the ability to predict the future. Amazing TA!

I like to watch this because it accurately portrays people who know nothing and pull things out of their ass like the general public :)

When the majority of people using crypto are traders/bots  then the price seems manipulated because the only thing driving the price is speculation and technical analysis.

Coinbase also has crazy "Coinbase tax" fees for purchasing. I remember the fee for $100 being like $20...
@_date: 2018-06-20 17:23:49
I prefer Gemini over GDAX because the taker fee is cheaper (1% vs 3% on GDAX) and there's no wire transfer fee. 3% of $1,000,000 = $30,000 fee... :) Have fun paying that when the market plummets or you have to FOMO in. I'm not pulling this out of my ass... This is from experience. Good luck

Lmao you're *waiting on your bank card* but crypto is the problem? 
@_date: 2018-06-20 17:46:34
Mate it goes by basis points. Go make a $1,000 sale and you will be charged $30 ending up with $970 vs ending up with $990 on Gemini.

I'm not sweating but you can chortle my balls

So given that each confirmation is 2-3 months apart, you expect us to go perpetually sideways for the next 6-9 months? If we have that many confirmations and no defined trend it'd be more likely to break to the downside

That's cute. Gemini doesn't charge a wire fee. Also the purchase fee is 1%... $1000 = $10 fee. Coinbase is garbage.

So on October 29th 2013, BTC was around $200 USD. As of today, Grandma's 5 blowstamps are worth around $50,000 USD :)
