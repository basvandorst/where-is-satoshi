If you're running code on a router, you can easily intercept and replace the result of http requests. For example, replacing any .mp4 files with a rickroll, or replacing all .jpg files with tubgirl. good times.

Sorry, was there something I said where I suggested that was happening? I'm pretty sure the "none of this is happening" in my post made it fairly clear that, yes, none of this is happening. I'm just throwing out scenarios where the type of exploit (that isn't happening) could happen in other circumstances.
@_date: 2016-04-10 14:19:44
I'm not confusing tricks at all. The fact is, someone could set up a seriously narrow target pinhole exploit like that, but it's rather unreasonabe, and if all the steps i the chain happen on https (and you're not doing a https proxy, which kind of ruins the point of https) then you're safe from it. It wasn't that long ago that [dd-wrt had a super awful XSS vunerability where you could craft an image url that was actually sending admin commands to your router.]( To compromise a specific target's router might be difficult, but if you cast a wide net you'll get the devices that are vulnerable.
Also, you don't need to use ARP if you're a router, you already get and process all the outbound traffic. Generally that means you're not molesting that traffic, or at most maybe handling NAT for it, but the same concepts allow you to modify it, rewrite URLs in html pages, etc. Think greasemonkey/tampermonkey, but rewriting code in transit at the network level.
The rickroll and tubgirl is just the silly case, not a serious suggestion. I tend to use rickrolls to demonstrate XSS and code injection vulnerabilities, as they humorously demonstrate that a vulnerability exists.

The idea that one domain is worth more than another is in itself a purely subjective manner. If it weren't, the registrars would sell them for different prices, rather than allowing Joe User speculatively buy them. 
Allowing someone to profit on the notion of "I thought someone else might want this name" doesn't make sense. Even in cases of trademark violations, it costs $1500 to file with WIPO, so domainers just register trademarks and sell them for $1450.
Regardless, I'm going back to looking for unregistered domains for a new project of mine.

HTTPS, until the SNI extension, limited you to a single site per IP address. Older platforms and browsers do not support SNI.

I think it perfectly compliments the rest of the post. is earning and deserving its reputation of becoming btc's amateur hour with these front paged nonsense articles and posts. There is already which actively tries to keep the bar high, while looks more and more like over time.
My top 3 tips for making good again which weren't followed in this post:
1. Post stuff about Bitcoin. This is not a Bitcoin story, and is only at a far tangent related.
2. Don't over-editorialize titles. "I for one am shocked!"
3. Don't feed the conspiracy theory trolls. Chemtrails aren't real, it wasn't a controlled demolition, and the moon landing actually happened. The NSA does enough real bullshit that we don't have to make up new stuff to blame them for. A single shred of evidence would have negated this point.

The classic issue with it is where do you put your trust? I can trust that your email address is whatever you say, but can I trust that you are the only one who can read it? Further, if I don't really know you (like now), how do I establish that your email address truly is yours and you haven't otherwise compromised the real Tim?
If you look at something like the HTTPS infrastructure, you can see a really awful way to do it. HTTPS relies on the idea that you explicitly trust some number of certificate authorities (signers), and that anything they sign must be true. The obvious problems are that a: nobody *actually* trusts godaddy, network solutions, comodo, etc, and b: they are all trusted equally and explicitly, so a government or other entity with leverage really only needs to apply it to one organization (that we don't really trust anyway) to be able to generate (forge) trusted keys for any name secured by this infrastructure.
The whole trust concept is not such a straightforward problem to solve, every method has substantial drawbacks.

That argument doesn't hold water. The entity with the deepest pockets isn't magically the entity that can use it to the most good.
Domains have a fixed cost, and an entire business model bloomed from the idea that you could register a domain with no intention of using it, beyond selling it to someone who would use it for a premium above that cost. It stifles real use of a limited resource, as new businesses don't want to pay thousands of dollars for a $8 domain.

Dear Supernintendo Lawsky,
Please don't cause New York (and states that follow them) to be excluded from digital currencies by placing unnecessary and unreasonable burden on users, merchants, and other businesses. From a user's perspective, there is no value to a currency being more difficult to use than cash. Adding the extra step of having to provide your legal name and address when you purchase a coffee is an unreasonable burden that no other form of payment must endure. For merchants, having to request that same information as well as store it for a period of 10 years, this is is no way comparable to other methods of payment. The simple concept of some of these businesses having to apply for a special license, when none is required for transaction is cash, credit, or barter, will cause digital currency companies to shut down or move away.
I know why you claim to want these rules in place. You say you want them because you're afraid of money laundering, terrorist funding, and drug trafficking.
We the people are not so afraid of the dark. We know that Cash is by orders of magnitude the currency of choice for these illegal endeavors, yet we can walk to 7-11 and buy a big gulp with a couple $1 bills without showing ID, registering with the merchant, or them having to purchase a special Cash license.
So are you being honest? Are digital currencies with market caps smaller than the budgets of your typical mexican drug cartel really more frightening than the [cash]( [they]( [stack]( like Walter White's storage locker? Or is it really just another step towards fascism in the name of safety?

When Overstock first announced they were accepting bitcoin, my GF and I spent over an hour each looking for something to buy. My only rule was that it had to be something we actually had a use for, it couldn't just be throwing bitcoin at a company for giggles. We eventually gave up. We're just not their target audience.
With that said, I've spent quite a few BTC with other vendors. honestember.com makes some great natural hot sauces. multirotorsuperstore.com is an awesome place to buy rc quadrotor parts. newegg.com is my favorite computer parts shop.
So kudos to Overstock, I'm really glad they're on board. I will look there occasionally when I need to pick up an item, maybe one of these days I'll find something there. I know a lot of people did find something. It's a big world out there, and increasing vendor participation (and competition) can only be a good thing for us.

This thing was on reddit around a month ago. It is not nearly as capable as you would expect.
It uses an arduino to drive the business logic. As a limited platform, you have to have pre-provisioned your bitcoin denominations and put their addresses on an SD card. When someone drops in a dollar, it reads the next key from the SD and prints out a receipt.
As I said before, don't take it too seriously, it dumps dollar bills (or 1 euro notes) into its plexiglass shell.

That's your own mental spin, not anything I said.
I'm just saying that Le Reddit Army can't resist a good witch hunt. This information was presented in nearly perfect troll form, 9/10 at a minimum. Maximize the exposure to the public while minimizing the inclusion of discussion from the person targeted. Check Sean's posting history. He regularly goes several days without posting. Every minute that passes since this was posted has the potential to irreparably harm his community standing, and the sheer size of it will require more than a trivial amount of time to respond to.
Maybe this stuff has merit. Maybe it doesn't. This was a shitty way to bring it public. If there was some clear sign of fraud, that would have been the message, not some 2 page questionnaire.

Oh, come on. PHP doesn't dump 0 into an address when there's an error, PHP has no fucking clue with Bitcoin is, what a Bitcoin address is, or what a good transaction looks like. Shitty code that doesn't check for errors and handle them properly do that, and that is not a language specific feature.
On the subject of speed, PHP with an opcode cache is actually very fast. Much faster than the Pythons and Rubys of the world. Don't take my word for it, though, go compare for yourself at an unbiased source: 
PHP slaughters Python and Ruby in most of the tests, and in the ones where it loses, it is only by a small margin.

If you had heard of Tiger Direct before they started talking bitcoin, you probably would have hated them. They had a long history of rebate fraud and earned a reputation for being a bad place to shop.The tl;dr version is that the owners of TD also owned OnRebate.com, who operated out of the same business address and exclusively processed rebates for TD. They used a variety of tricks and lies to avoid paying the large rebates offered on many items at TD. In the end, the CEO was forced to not only resign, but also to pay back nearly 10 million dollars worth of his compensation.

It was open source last month too. I love arduino, but it's just the wrong choice for something that needs to understand cryptograpy, network communications, database transaction logging, etc. 32k (or 256k on some boards) of flash and 2k (or 8k on some boards) of RAM just isn't going to build it.
This project is more appropriately an example of interfacing arduino with a bill accepter and a printer, even if those examples already existed. Taking it to the "next level" would change it completely, at minimum moving the processing to an additional device, at minimum something like a raspberry pi.

That's one of the features that cold make it a 'teller' rather than a dispenser... I'm not sure where you live that cash deposits are new but in the US that's been a common feature since the 80s.

I was going to write a huge long essay, but instead I'll try to be brief.
* First off, remember that you're dealing with a bunch of for-profit companies. Your agent is a salesman, he is not on your side. Every company gets their cut, and there will be many involved in the process. Agent, broker, underwriter, multiple inspectors, title insurer, loan insurer, property insurer. Which leads to the second point.
* Realtors and lenders have their buddy networks. They will default to sending you to the people who give them the best terms, which is different from giving you the best terms. As a buyer, you may not be told that you can choose competitive options from other outlets, or you may be told that doing so will make the process harder, less likely to be approved, etc.
* The borrowing process is literally framed backwards, and generally we have accepted it. They aren't trying to win your business, they are trying to convince you that you have earned their product. How many products do they congratulate you for being eligible to purchase? Or make you jump through arbitrary eligibility hoops? Loans aren't a prize, they are literally the Only Product They Sell. You aren't "so fortunate" you got approved to pay them rather obscene amounts of money for the luxury of not saving up the purchase price of a home. Which leads me to...
* Interest rates over 30 year periods are insane. Just consider this for a moment: if you buy a home for $200k and finance it over a 30 year period at a 5% fixed rate, you will have paid $375k. This is just for the loan, not counting the bonus fees like PMI. Also,
* Mortgage companies are offering worse and worse products, and convincing buyers to consider them. No payments for a year? You've just let them accrue 12 more months of interest on the full amount of the loan. It's like making your first payment 12 extra times, but spread out over the life of the loan. Balloon mortgages? Interest only loans? ADJUSTABLE RATES? Insanity.
The real problem to me is that there is very little education around home buying and ownership, and what that really can mean financially. We're told that everyone should strive to own a home, it's the american dream. We're told things like homes are good investments, which are generally not true. Or my personal favorite, that mortgage interest is  a great tax write off (really, you spend $10k a year in interest payments so you can save $500 on your taxes?)
I could go on, but I won't.

Well the panel was mostly industry folks. When government representatives were talking, it was law enforcement representatives, and they of course wanted more law, more power, more tools, etc.
To most people, the fact that they had just taken down the Silk Road would have indicated that they already had enough tools, enough power, enough laws, etc. Their perspective is that doing it was "hard", and that it should be easier. Of course, power granted to the government is by definition power taken from the people, and hard work has only recently become a good enough reason to make that transfer of rights.
There was one woman who should have been kicked out, as all she did was use her time to talk about her company's upcoming gold-backed centralized digital currency..

Exchanging currencies is a competitive market. There are a bunch of avenues out there you can use, and they vary wildly in terms of convenience and cost. Generally, the easier methods are more expensive, as the vendor is doing a lot of the work for you, and taking a larger chunk of the risk in the transaction.  This isn't unique to Bitcoin. If you want to exchange larger quantities of currency, you would want to use more of a traditional exchange.

I can go to Coinbase right now and have a bitcoin purchase completed within seconds, and I expect most other people in this sub can do the same. If you want to question why they only accept Visa, that's a good question that should be asked. If you want to question bank transfers vs direct credit, that's fair too.

You can blame me if you want, I don't mind. From a practical standpoint, I'm an infrequent bitcoin user, and bitcoin core makes that a relatively painful thing to be. The last straw was when I carefully backed up my ~ directory, reinstalled a fresh xubuntu, restored my data, and bitcoin-core decided my block archive was corrupt and had to start from scratch. Three days later, when my balance was accessible again, I sent my coins to a new address generated in Electrum.

SSL is ultimately a poorly played game of trust. The way the field is right now, there are a number of signers out there, which all are equally trusted. Any one of them could sign your cert, and any other one could sign a perfectly valid cert for your domain that your browser would happily also accept. Any one of them could work with a government, or find themselves the victim of an exploit, which allows a group with bad intentions to forge your site's identity to whatever goals they may have.
Who do you trust? Do you trust [Network Solutions]( [VeriSign]( Doesn't matter, if you use HTTPS, you are automatically trusting these guys as well as every other signer that squirmed their way into your browser's included certificate list.
This is the core problem with HTTPS, and a major way it is different from other forms of PKI.  If you look at pgp/gpg encryption, there is the notion of levels of trust. You don't trust anyone by default except yourself, and if you choose to add trust for an entity, that trust applies to a single key, not blindly to any key that happens to have the same name. 
HTTPS certificates are set up in such a way as to make man in the middle attacks extremely straightforward, relying on leverage rather than cryptography to break it.

Now that I have a little more time to respond to you, here's the deal. Reveal is a company, they have created their pseudo-cryptocurrency using a combination of actual crypto currency tech (at least buzzwords) and traditional gift card tech. See Amazon Coin for another example.
The reason I suggested you might be a spammer is that your post reads like a concern troll. A rather quick read of their site makes it pretty apparent that this is not something on the same level as a true cryptocurrency.
Similarly, suggesting you might be stupid is based on the idea that you should have determined rather quickly that Reveal is not comparable to a real crypto currency, and that mentioning it (and including a nice link to them) would only propagate their scheme.
The value of Bitcoin is set by the market, you can sell it for as much as someone is willing to pay for it, and vice-versa. This is the same for basically all functional currencies, or even commodities. Cash works this way, you trade your product or service or other value for an amount of cash you mutually agree is fair.  With Reveal, those controls are outside of your influence, and controlled entirely by Reveal Inc.
They've created something much more comparable to Lindens, or in the physical world, Beanie Babies. It's 100% corporate controlled.
This puts all the power into the hands of the company, and none of it to you. Where do you benefit from it's "crypto" aspect? I'll save you the time on researching, you don't ever benefit from it.
The fact that they've gotten 1.5 million dollars out of VCs in no way suggests they have any legitimacy or that their technology has any actual value. Those VC dollars are awarded to a business model, not to a cryptocurrency.

While he may not have laid it out clearly, his statement is absolutely true.
The software for unlocking (which does not currently exist) can only be created if a backdoor method already existed for it to utilize. You can't retroactively make encrypted data vulnerable, the vulnerability has to already exist at the time of encryption.
Therefore, the claim that creating such a tool is technically feasible absolutely implies that such a backdoor must already exist.

No domain is worth more than the reg fee on its own. If you sell a business that includes the domain name, the domain name is still only worth $11 or so, what you're buying is the business associated with it.

I think you are missing a key point, though. The inherent value of 1 BTC is based on the costs to replace it. This breaks down to a combination of the cost to mine it and the liquidity of the market allowing them to be sold from peoples' inventories.
Bitcoin as a concept is valuable because of the blockchain and the network and the magical things you can do with it, but those don't really apply to the valuation of a unit of BTC. There really just isn't a magic number that 1BTC should equate to in another currency, any more than the price of silver.

You do have a backup right?
RAID0 doesn't provide any redundancy, so if you lose a drive you lose all your data. If you don't have that backup, you get to start calling expensive data recovery companies and spend potentially a few thousand dollars potentially getting your wallet back, and potentially not getting your wallet back.

SSDs don't store the data in a linear manner the way a hard drive does. They maintain a translation table of LBA (logical block addresses) vs physical addresses. This is how they are able to do things like wear leveling to spread writes over the drive rather than wear out a frequently used block. It also allows them to silently fail a block and replace it from a spare pool without having to fail the drive. As such, you don't really get an indication that an SSD is failing until it is dead without using things like SMART tools.
RAID0 is a good place to keep data you don't need to exist but you need to be fast.

Seriously, application layer encryption is NOT hard, it is NOT expensive. It is SO close to free, you make a dangerous argument. 
FACT: A circa 2011 midrange laptop, with an i5 Sandy Bridge CPU, averaged 277MB/s of AES throughput. This is more than double the speed of datacenter grade Gig-E on a $500 laptop! And that was without the hardware AES acceleration, which bumped it 5x higher! 
Please, please, please, please stop making excuses for not using encryption. Comparing BTC mining to real world data encryption is equally insane, it is so amazingly unrelated.

Not that I would advocate against disk-level encryption, but in this case you're incorrect. The data revealed in the slide was application-layer, specifically it was database replication.
We know Google is a big user of MySQL. Here is how simple it is to implement encrypted replication: 
We also know Google uses Oracle RDBMS, you can find the simple (for Oracle) steps to configure SSL for ataGuard replication here: 
At this level, it really isn't any more difficult than HTTPS, not that that would be an excuse.

Out of the many opportunities to use encryption, network communications are among the easiest, and least expensive. Modern on-chip crypto acceleration is an order of magnitude faster than any server-level network or storage interface.

After years in an IT security role, I have to say that you are dead wrong. That is the point of view of a typical IT manager, who doesn't live in the trenches.
All networks should be considered compromised, all the time. There is nothing magical about your internal private network that makes it somehow safer than any other.
Google employs a LOT of smart guys, and I'm sure they argued for application level encryption, and were probably shot down by managers because its "too complex", "too expensive", "adds too much latency", etc. The world has changed since 1996. Encryption is easy, it is fast, it is cheap. There is no excuse for this other than incompetence.
I've been there. I've shown C level execs packet captures showing them their passwords in plain text. I've shown them simple shell scripts that passively grabbed our customer credit card data off the wire. I've done my best to impress on them that any data worth having is worth protecting, and I've been show down for decade-invalid reasoning. The resistance to basic security precaution is just insane, but it exists.

You continue to overstate the "cost" of encryption, despite clear evidence to the contrary. And seriously, are you even reading what you're typing?  "private fiber line which is only accessible to you and bandwidth providers"? How is that private?

That's a pretty interesting take on my experience, but it was good for a laugh. Thanks!
So back to planet earth. You're overstating the problem. Let me explain:
Google's clustered filesystem (GoogleFS) is a non-trivial piece of code. Incorporating transport-layer encryption is actually quite easy by comparison. Furthermore, almost all of the "hit" of encryption is during connection setup, the ongoing cost of encryption/decrypting data is, for all intents and purposes, free. Encryption hasn't been "hard" for years.
Obviously you don't want to go and write your own encryption stack from scratch for every, but you don't have to. The OpenSSL team did the truly hard work for you. Don't like OpenSSL? That's fine, check out DJB's NaCL encryption library. Oh wait, maybe Google knows about it, since they are a major contributor!
Step back for a second and realize what you're doing. You are literally making excuses for a methodology that is proven to be ineffective. Your reasoning is nonsensical. It doesn't make sense why. I really think you are just trolling at this point. Congrats on getting me to reply.

I agree, but this really is an issue that didn't get nearly the attention it deserved. Yesterday's hearing touched several times on the issue of banks not granting accounts to bitcoin related businesses, but Anthony's statement really illustrates it better. In a previous thread, it was quotes that only 2% of bitcoin exchange transactions were done in the US, and while I don't have a source for the claim, it sounds about right. The major bitcoin infrastructure is overseas, and the difficulty of american citizens to participate in the bitcoin economy seems to be on the rise.
A few months ago, you could get bitcoin by mining, without doing anything extravagant. Those days are gone, and the points of entry for us are as difficult or worse than the existing currency markets. We need a US based exchange that can convert dollars to bitcoin in an efficient, timely, and reliable manner. The world is passing us by.
@_date: 2013-11-05 19:30:26
Seriously? The data does have to be decrypted at some point, but that point is not *right before you transfer it over the goddamn network*.

There is a good reason why nearly all modern processors support SSL acceleration. This isn't new, it isn't slow, it isn't expensive, it isn't limited to one vendor or architecture, and it isn't an excuse.
Pointing fingers at "costs" as a magical evil entity is a manager's trick. Engineers know that "nearly free" isn't quite the same as "totally free", but let's not kid ourselves - doing more is rarely faster than doing less. We have the tools to do it with negligible cost for quite some time. 
Look, I remember when encryption was hard. I had more than my share of SSL accelerator cards around y2k, and I rejoiced when Sun launched the Niagra CPU in 2004 with multi-gigabit on-chip AES. That's our past, we're not there any more. My cell phone has a hardware AES engine that can process data at a multiple of its fastest interface speed. The hardest part of the work is done, we're not figuring out how to make bricks, we can focus on how to stack them.
When I say "just use NaCL or OpenSSL", I'm not taking to my mom, I'm talking to a developer. There is a learning curve with those libraries just like there is with any other, but they really aren't any more difficult than any other library of that size. For topology, there are a few basic forms of doing encrypted communication, and very few reasons to deviate from them. The fact is, SSL takes its biggest hit at the point of establishing a session, which in infrastructure cases is usually a rare event.
As far as Mike's comments, I understand where he is coming from. It is harder to add encryption after the fact, and with the general apathy towards encryption, the constant repetition of how hard it is, it can be tough to get that past the project owners. They collectively made assumptions that proved to be wrong, the world evolved in spite of their plan.

Honestly, this whole exploit just hits too close to home. I fought the battles for database link level encryption years ago. Dozens-of-terabytes scale database cluster, extremely high volume applications, business critical functionality. The proof was in the pudding: the application didn't measurably slow down, the server utilization didn't measurably rise, and the world did not end. The battle to get there was long and hard and difficult and frustrating, because the managers (and even some of the engineers) were living in the 90s. In the end, it was obvious that the majority of the work the database servers did was database work, and network level encryption was a trivial expense with obvious advantages. The problem largely stopped being a technical one years ago.
You are correct that AES is only part of the puzzle, but it used to be the biggest part. Key exchange and negotiation is where you take your hit, but in almost every case other than HTTPS, that only needs to happen occasionally.
I won't say that there are no cases where CPU assisted encryption isn't good enough, only a Sith speaks in absolutes. I will say that most of those are a product of poor design, or aren't really "encryption" (btc mining is a good example of that). Unassisted crypto of popular ciphers is already a multiple of network wire speeds, hardware acceleration takes it to a new level.
If I had to pick a gripe with hardware crypto, it would have to be that AMD and Intel only accelerate AES, where other vendors chose to accelerate multiple ciphers. Given the popularity of AES in modern crypto, that's not much of a gripe.
