nuances matter in a system like this.  There is already a transaction feature.  Why have two.
@_date: 2017-10-23 18:19:30
are you huffing rocks? 


That link that you're too mentally unstable to just read was where that chart originated, so it's relevant.


Simply pointed out that the purple was meant to indicate the presence of Segwit on the original, and a hard fork in Jameson's.  He could have just made his own chart, but instead refactored that one to fit his narrative.


Not sure what point you're making here. Could be the crack rock talking.


Again, not really sure where this came from.
I just want to see a global currency that is accessible to everyone man.  Segwit didn't bring town tx fees and the mempool is still huge.  I believe Bitcoin is so special because it is BOTH a store of value and a solid currency.  I think it will scale to surpass Visa or Mastercard levels with bigger blocksizes (Dr. Rizun succesfulyl propagated a 1g block)! The technological limitations will go away (Moor's Law!) with time.  I am for as conservative of an approach as possible and Segwit is anything but conservative.
@_date: 2017-10-23 13:24:18
The diagram is retarded. The purple color was originally meant to distinguish Segwit.  Segwit was not a part of the original Bitcoin, not a difficult concept to see Bitcoin has been co-opted. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 17:09:46
Are there caveats, sure. However it was not a lie to claim the project changed hands inside of Core.  
Tx malleability wouldn't be an issue if 0-conf were reliable on the Segwitchain, but since blocks are small, txs have to que up for a spot in a block, which makes the malleability an actual issue. Explain if you see it differently.

This was the original chart   The purple color is used to represent SegWit, because it was a softfork.  My point is that Jameson's chart is disingenuous because the coloring just represents a hard-fork, which is different than the original meaning.  
Not sure why you're so triggered, but I actually use Bitcoin so I have every right to complain about transaction fees.  I will never move my Bitcoin off chain into a Segwit wallet.  
Segwit is a peg to the Bitcoin blockchain and we all know what happens to pegs as time goes on (ie. USD pegged to Gold), they eventually fail.  So now instead of having a completely enclosed system, we now have pegged systems. 
This is a radical change to the Bitcoin protocol.  It would have been a much more conservative approach on a technical level to simply increase the max blocksize.  I think Segwit is a cool idea but it does not belong on Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-19 04:31:17
on a purely technical level that's not exactly wrong.  Segwit was a major change to the Bitcoin code base regardless if you're for or against it.  One could make the same argument about the EDA, but I would argue that it's a major tweak in an already existing feature vs. a new feature in general. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 10:45:43
The way I see it a straight block size increase is the more conservative approach because it's a somewhat arbitrary parameter change vs the addition of a whole new feature.   Don't get me wrong  Segwit is pretty damn slick hack.  But it is ultimately a hack at the end of the day.  I can run a BCH full node with a 1TB HDD from Amazon for like 50 bucks.   The idea that big blocks ruin the ability to run a full node is a lie.   
Your metaphor only considers price? In terms of the actual network BCH is on average much faster, cheaper, and more resilient.
@_date: 2017-10-23 16:34:48
What does it have to do with? It is my understanding that Segwit allowed for side chains and you/blockstream invented side chains ?  
Bitcoin is a cryptographically enclosed monetary system, I'm not sure you can decouple that.
@_date: 2017-10-23 19:51:44
Because it has its own merkle tree, which is distinct from the main tree (the blockchain).  Hence, Segwit transactions are not entirely on the same chain.  


Obviously not. But I'd relax with the node fetish.  They're not as important as you think they are.
@_date: 2017-10-23 19:04:38
I don't think it's a bug if that's what you're asking.  It hasn't been a problem to the average user in anyway since Bitcoin was created.
However, I do think work can be done to improve malleability and I think it can be done without moving transactions off chain like Segwit did.  I would like to see all transactions stay on the main merkle tree, since that is how Bitcoin has traditionally worked.
@_date: 2017-10-23 15:29:29
The original people are gone and there has been a change in hands of commit access. 
The  and  guys with most commits work for your organization, with  being largely complicit despite not being on the official pay role (probably so you can go around and make this argument).  
You guys used that influence to get your feature into the protocol and fundamentally change Bitcoin. It has its own name and logo and should be considered its own coin, Segwitcoin.  
@_date: 2017-10-23 17:43:46
Gavin was the de facto leader.  He supported a simple blocksize increase.  Your organization gradually become more and more involved over the years and reject this solution in favor of Segwit.
Albeit everyone is still technically under the Bitcoin Core umbrella, commit access has changed a lot as well as the priorities.  
Change is inevitable, but at least own it. In my view it is disingenuous to claim I'm lying by saying Gavin and Mike were a part of Core, and that Bitcoin reached multiple thousands before Segwit.  That is all true.
@_date: 2017-10-23 16:20:13
it's not a lie you guys came after Gavin and Mike Hearn was a member of Core, you just admitted it.  
Number of commits is not a 1:1 ratio to the value of an engineer.
@_date: 2017-10-22 08:37:51
Core used to be Gavin and Mike Hern, so without Blockstream to be more precise.
@_date: 2017-10-19 22:31:17
it was thousands of dollars before Segwit even activated, so you make no sense.
@_date: 2017-10-23 14:48:36
Well the 2 highest ranking engineers left the project largely do to your organizations toxicity and then you guys forced your feature onto the network, instead of making your own coin, which you should have done if you wanted to play with sidechains. So I think there is a valid argument that can be made there, even ramp up in influence on the protocol was gradual.  
You guys changed the protocol at a fundamental level (a transaction) to fit your business model.  I think side chains are a neat idea but I did not think they belonged on Bitcoin, especially not as a scaling solution.
Interested in hearing your thoughts on Dr. Rizun's 1g block.
@_date: 2017-10-23 20:22:43


Also you


They are related because they are both Blockstream brainchilds 


I agree.  That is why you can't really use the "its basically multisig" argument because it is part of a larger feature.
@_date: 2017-10-19 04:38:38
thought you guys didn't like big blocks
@_date: 2017-10-23 18:05:20
It has its own merkle tree!  
I just don't see how this isn't classic over-engineering.  
The conservative solution was to raise the max blocksize.  But you guys decided to go for the Rube Goldberg solution by adding 3k lines of code to the protocol.
@_date: 2017-10-23 14:58:37
I did.  Look at the drop off in commits from 2014-2015 from Garzik, Hearn, and Gavin.  You can't argue Gavin wasn't the number 1 guy back then.
Also a chart that reflected actual merges would be more accurate that who is simply making commits, anyone can spam commits. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 20:01:44
Still doesn't disprove my point that its bloat.  Why do we need a federated side chain to make a simple transaction, when there is already a transaction feature, why have 2? 
There is no multisig extention block or merkle tree so it is still fully on chain.
@_date: 2017-10-23 17:19:44
So in your view a Segwit transaction is on chain?
@_date: 2017-10-23 13:48:03
By that logic Bitcoin should be called Segwitcoin because a new team took over.
I was referring to the coloring besides.
@_date: 2017-10-23 20:11:44
 
Educate yourself and comeback.
Explain to me why you think they're so important. I personally don't their real significance to the functionality of the network.  Although they are pretty cool.
@_date: 2017-10-23 15:59:45


The first 5 on that link + Jeff no longer have commit access.


Ok you got me there, he's a co-founder.


He's not a part of Blockstream so you can claim not all core devs work for you even though you guys subscribe to the same line of thought.


Not as a scaling solution.  Tx malleability was a problem created by core by not allowing the mempool to clear every block, because you guys refused to simple change max blocksize, which has been done in the past and is in my opinion the most conservative solution.  Instead you guys added ~4k lines of code for a feature that didn't even solve the problem.  
I used to be able to send $.25 to my friends to show them how cool Bitcoin is. Now I have to pay $3-5 to maybe get in the next block.
@_date: 2017-10-23 20:33:09
the witness data is on it's own tree, which I do not view as technically on-chain, due to the separation of the data.  What's wrong with that?
@_date: 2017-10-23 13:35:39
yeah good luck paying $3-5 per transaction.
@_date: 2017-10-23 16:10:14


Explain this to me then. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 19:37:50


Technically, but you're still bending the definition a bit, and there is something to be said about that. 
I just don't understand why we had to add 4k lines for a minor enhancement.  
In my view it just adds bloat to the codebase and the fact that it was sold as a scaling solution is suspect to me. 
I don't think it is unreasonable to want to be conservative when it comes to making protocol changes.  The max blocksize has been raised before, however a protocol change this major has never happened before. 
If they're on chain then why do they need special Segwit addresses when the functionality is exactly the same (unlike multi-sig)?
A Bitcoin tx != a Segwit tx, which is why I think it should be called Segwitcoin
@_date: 2017-10-23 16:59:30
So correct me then. I thought sidechains needed a tx malleability fix to work, which Segwit accomplishes off-chain.
