I was shocked that I had ~5 people recommend Bitfloor around April, and no one mentioned that incident.
Even if he lost access to the USD, that doesn't explain why my BTC (deposited in April) are still stuck on his servers. :\
@_date: 2013-07-13 20:34:14
Sub 3k.  Still waiting on BOTH BTC and USD owed. :\
Until I see people actually getting paid and able to spend their money (or cash in hand), I'm holding off on celebration.
@_date: 2013-07-07 13:58:50
Right, I had several BTC stuck in their system that I wanted to sell, which has cost me several hundred dollars.  ...and it's still stuck.
@_date: 2013-08-02 02:34:59
Nothing here yet. :\

I still have bitcoins stuck in his system from April (no even pre-hack).  If he had any integrity, he would have fixed that "Internal Server error" or at least added a form where you could submit an address where you wanted the funds to be sent when their system is back up (or sent the damn things manually even).

Thank you for not taking offense &amp; not taking it personally.  The above is somewhere between a mixed compliment, with a highly skeptical look out of the corner of my eye. ;)

Holy shit, I see an additional balance in my bank account.
You wouldn't believe some of the fucked up shit I had to deal with today - and finally seeing this balance in my account is one of the few things I can be happy about today.
P.S.  I just sold 2oz of good at well below my "percieved value" because I needed to free up some cash, that's how... shitty my situation is.
@_date: 2013-07-07 15:07:49


Appreciated that you shared this info with someone, I can't blame everyone as a whole.
@_date: 2013-08-13 03:30:50
My funds were recieved, and just in time.  Still feels Roman owes me that $5 + interest, but instead I'll happily make sure persons are aware of this (and the previous loss/theft) in the future.   Thanks to the IFC for getting stuff done, they're the heroes of this situation, but I can't help but notice how poorly Roman handled (and continues to handle) the situation.
Roman also still owes me several BTC, so we'll see what happens there - and I have yet to see any explanation or expression of intent to return those BTC.

How many pitchforks and torches can $3/4 of a million  buy?
@_date: 2013-07-06 19:46:07
I was already uncomfortable enough sending them my photo ID, and now they want my social-security number, address, phone number, banking info, etc - and I have to open an account with another bank?  Yay for getting my money back, but damn....
You know my name is on a NSA/FBI/Homeland-Security/etc watchlist with all of the personal info they could ever possibly want.
Also, I'm still getting page errors when trying to withdraw my BTC.
Something I'm still a bit confused by is this: several months ago I asked around for a reliable, trusthworth exchange, and I was told to use bitfloor by several users.  Not one of them felt it necessary to tell me about that one time he lost several thousand bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-07-10 16:18:18
I've been following this here, and [at bitcoin talk]( and I haven't seen any solid confirmations yet.
@_date: 2013-07-25 17:20:23
Rant incoming, and I hope I'm wrong about everything....
I've seen enough runarounds in my days - and it's always "just around the corner" then always "something comes up" but "we're really close, seriously this time!" and this cycle continues; the delays as usual are never their fault &amp; they're always waiting on someone else.  This is classic textbook "Runarounds 101" for beginners.  Do we have any confirmation of anything yet?  Information from ANY source but Roman/Bitfloor, the IFCU, and Audex?  Has CaptialOne even confirmed the original account closure?  Have we had a single piece of real verifyable info yet?
Even Audex.  Disclaimer: There's a good chance I'm wrong, I'm sorry, but this has to be said.  Audex, if you read this &amp; aren't "involved" then don't take offense, I'm simply encouraging people to think for themselves.
Like I said, this has to be said, there's a chance Audex is in on the runaround.  Why has no one.... had Roman arrested, sent lawyers, sent the FBI/SEC/etc, sent private investigators, hell sent a bounty hunter?  Because of Audex, the kind middleman who ... contacted everyone, generously acquires updates, encourages people to be patients, and spreads the news that everything that's just around the corner.
I could totally be wrong; Audex could be like me 10 years ago; a kind generous guy who resolves conflicts and takes initiative... but perhaps does so at everyone's expense.  I've learned some conflicts are meant to happen, and some fires are meant to be lit.  Where has Roman been through all of this, because the only reason everyone hasn't been lighting real fires underneath Roman is because "Audex has that handled."

Right, I have yet to see an explanation yet, this seems completely illogical and no reason to be related to his bank account being closed, unless he lacks the BTC to cover the deposits in his system.


Entirely possible - 5 sock-puppets, a couple minutes each, enabling him to scam over $1k....?  Seems reasonable.


I probably shouldn't say too much, but someone there's a business model floating around for bounties &amp; decentralized currencies.
@_date: 2013-11-10 23:17:27
Yes, sorry, I should have specified that. :P
@_date: 2013-07-25 23:21:46
I won't even try to speculate or give him excuses.  If something had happened, he's obviously said nothing yet.
@_date: 2013-07-25 23:26:26
Yea, through all of this, I only discovered bitfloor was "under maintenance" so to speak when I tried to log into my account.  No email from bitfloor, nothing.  I had to do a google search to discover why I couldn't get my money.
I mean seriously, you can't even send an email to your customers "Hey, I'm sorry, but we've had to shut down and are working on a way to get your money back."
I'm not asking for a PR genius here, but this is amongst the shittiest customer service ever.
@_date: 2013-07-25 20:02:17
Seeing as the April 2013 bitcoins (which he could have easily refunded) have been locked behind an internal server error, he doesn't seem to be making any genuine efforts to get our money back.
@_date: 2013-11-10 03:12:35
PMed you.
It kinda pisses me off that the biggest bitcoin advocates aren't taking these things more seriously.
@_date: 2013-11-10 23:23:17
$345 x 21 btc = $7245.  Ouch
IMO, the community if they want to grow, really needs to start addressing the questions of liability, responsibility, and security.  I can't recommend bitcoin to friends - not because of anything against bitcoin, but rather because I think it's far too easy for people to be scammed.  IMO, it's surprising I even got my USD refund, but my BTC refund is (according to current prices) equivalent to that USD refund.
If I got scammed, how much more-so would my family and friends risk getting scammed?  Hell, the entire reason I used bitfloor in the first place was based off of recommendations by people in Loosing access to USD for a few months may have an excuse, but not able to refund the BTC with no explanation?  Fucking scammer...
@_date: 2013-07-06 20:59:27
Same here though I think audenx has only been following the USD situation and not the BTC situation.
@_date: 2013-07-07 13:58:00
Unless he comes out publicly with decisive and transparent documentation of the ENTIRE incident, showing clearly that government/his bank was responsible, ... I too will reccomend people avoid him like the plague.
Losing 25000 BTC, and then losing access to everyone's funds for a few months is entirely unacceptable.  Even if not "his fault" that's like a bank say "sorry, we didn't steal your gold in our vault, a thief did."
@_date: 2013-10-19 16:29:04
Bitfloor is holding several of my BTC as well.  I have my USD refund, but it's only half of what Roman owes me.
If anyone does sue, it's fairly normal to sue for an amount that is a multiple (2x, 3x, etc) of any embezzled funds.
@_date: 2013-07-25 22:47:08
I discovered it a little late and looking at the big picture (having not been yanked around yet by the runaround) was that this was like every other runaround I've been through.  As such, I pretty much wrote it off from (my own) day-1 as a loss.
Hope?  Well, lets just say I want my money back.  On the other end of that is ... would be a lack of surprise to see news that Roman's left the country.
@_date: 2013-08-03 04:22:14
Not a single word yet.
I also cannot access my BTC either.
@_date: 2013-07-10 16:16:24


Same - I'm still waiting for reports that people are actually getting paid and able to access their money before a celebration *(not merely an account balance on IAFCU)*.  I've seen the runaround enough times in my life to know that even when a person claims progress is a millimeter away doesn't mean it's actually going to happen.    I've been watching this thread on reddit, as well as the [bitcoin-talk thread.](
My account still shows "refund information under review."  I also have several bitcoins stuck behind an "internal server error."
@_date: 2013-07-07 13:49:18
^  That's known as framing.
I'm just mad at myself for listening, and learned my lesson (several time) that often isn't the best place for Bitcoin advice and information.
No, I'm not entitled, but I can point out that may not be a great place for bitcoin advice.  Another one (which I didn't listen to) was when bitcoin hit $250-260/BTC, and then started dropping, many were calling "hold!" and saying it was a temporary thing.


So?  That "theft" cost bitfloor members thousands of BTC &amp; that's the kind of info that's important to know before trusting your money in someone else's hands.
@_date: 2013-07-25 20:03:10
Nothing here yet, still waiting. :\
@_date: 2013-07-27 20:11:38
I haven't received a SINGLE email from bitfloor since the time I opened my account in early April.  Not one.  The only way I found out about all of this was when I tried to log in and withdraw my BTC/USD.
@_date: 2013-10-19 22:28:58
It's somewhat odd to see the biggest advocate of bitcoin, not taking this situation seriously.  There's likely at least $1-mill plus worth of bitcoins locked behind an "internal service error," which is not to mention the previous bitcoins that were "stolen from bitfoor" in an earlier incident *(probably sitting in an account Roman controls)*.
Roman can't even say a single word about what/why/when the April-03 bitcoins will be released, or plans/actions towards preparing those for release back to their owners.
Here 'we' are rallying against the idea the IMF for having the audacity to discuss the possibility of raiding 10% of every bank account, and bitcoin is supposed to be the savior, and yet no one is willing to address the fraud that occours with bitcoin quite regularly.
Hell, I had several members of recommend I use bitfloor, AFTER the incident where bitfloor already lost many thousands of BTC.  I only learned about the incident AFTER, the April-03 incident.
If Bitfloor is ever going to be a success, situations like this need to be dealt with seriously and not swept under the rug.  I'd love to advocate BTC to friends and family, however I've learned first-hand that it's not secure enough for me to be able to make such a recommendation.
