Unfortunately I downloaded it myself. I don't recall a 24-word seed, but knowing that it might've been important, I may have actually done a smart thing and saved it elsewhere....so I guess now I need to hunt around and see if I can't find that.....
Thanks for the help!

Ah ok, very interesting. Ok, time to really get to digging.
@_date: 2019-07-26 17:26:18
Got it, that makes sense. Thanks!

Based on the latest exchange rates, yep, it definitely is :)

Ok got it. I think the crux of it is, I need to get the HDD, and if I can get that, I should be in the clear.
Thank you!

Understood - thanks for your help!

I must have saved this key somewhere. Is it sometimes saved as a different filetype, or pretty much just a string of characters that could be saved on any text/word file?

Thanks man, much appreciated.
I guess I'm just embarrassed because it's kinda a silly thing.
It's like someone giving you some valuables that you put into a safe, then you forget what the combination is. 
Meanwhile, it's the simplest thing to write down said combination and store it somewhere safe and easy to access. 
Silly me :)

I don't believe the HD has been wiped, although I can't be 100% on that :(
Thankfully it's not a LOT of Bitcoin...but still, recovering it would be good if I can

Gotcha, will try that! Thanks

Yeah that makes sense. I think I already knew that, but was hoping there may be some weird "workaround" or something. I just managed to dig up the address, so I could lookup what the value of the Bitcoin is now. Increase of 1200% over the last 5 years....insane!










I didn't recall anything about a private key until you brought it up. Its highly unlikely I **wouldn't** have saved that info SOMEWHERE, so I'll have to do more digging.
Provided I can find that, can I use that info to then download a new wallet and "recover" things?


Not 100% on this, but in looking at the available options, I think Bitcoin Core was the one I had.
Thanks for your help and input on this, much appreciated!
