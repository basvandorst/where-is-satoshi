I hope it fucking crashes soon so we can move on and people stop buying all fucking gpußs off the market for this shit.
@_date: 2018-09-07 11:18:21
You sound like an expert.
@_date: 2018-05-24 07:36:39
so you predicted this and clearly you sold right before so you can make money by buying the dip, right ?
@_date: 2018-05-26 10:35:28
The correct question would be will blockchain be adopted by the masses. Possible. Will bitcoin be adopted by the masses ? Less likely than the first one as there are similar technologies doing the same.
That's what alot of people misunderstand, they think bitcoin = blockchain. It isn't it's one of the technologies and undoubetdly at the moment the most popular one. Will that remain the way it is ? Nobody knows, in the current marketprice there's predictions that it is and the dreams of every wannabe investor so it's probably overvalued at this point.
It's interesting to say the least.

Yeah but if you make 100 times of what you invested then 99 other people will have lost the same amount. You guys DO understand that these principles only work for the very few either lucky or skilled ones.
Money is not created out of nothing. Stay for the technology, not the profits.
This is a giant merry go around where the last ones will foot the bills of the first ones if you're in for the profits. But hey, at least you can post smart pictures with cool coins and memes.

I'm pretty sure he's 99% more competent than anyone in this sub between the "i inv3st, i am sm3rt, need to g3t r1ch!" and "my friends told me bitcoin is the shit!". Not sure if he ever included Meme's and halfwit Quotes into his strategy as an investor but i might be wrong.
@_date: 2018-05-12 08:48:25
You sound like someone that researched alot before investing his money sensibly.

"overwhelming evidence"
Do tell. And what are those benefits ? Cure or treating Symptoms ?
"It's impossible to know whether surgery would have been curative if Jobs had undergone the procedure at the time of his diagnosis."
True, it's also impossible to tell wether carl would have survived his car accident had he worn his seat belt. Doesn't mean he shouldn't have. Risk is risk, not certainty after the fact.
@_date: 2018-06-18 11:54:49
I think it's going to settle around 5000 and be "stable" at least for BC levels.
@_date: 2018-06-21 09:26:20
Cherrypicking facts to make bogus comparisons, nice!
@_date: 2018-06-23 13:34:28
I feel sorry for the toilet, ok that's enough internet for today.

That's the guy that had cancer and decided not to take school medicine right ? How did that work out ?
@_date: 2018-06-13 21:09:12
Don't think you did anything other than trying to get rich quick.
@_date: 2018-06-11 10:02:31
You know that eventually everything ends. And whoever is on the chair the last time will foot the bill for everyone that came before. You awfully sound like one of those.
@_date: 2019-02-26 12:36:06
An ad hominem would be if he says the content of his message is invalid because of how dirty his room looks. It's valid criticism on the form of the content delivered, don't hide behind an ad hominem argument here.
Example: "I don't think Warren is wrong considering how dirty your room looks, tidy up man"
@_date: 2018-03-15 09:16:00
Yeah yeah, it also cures cancer and we will all be rich. Common guys you just look stupid.
@_date: 2018-11-24 22:20:44
I hope you can buy many bitcoins from your upvotes
@_date: 2018-11-26 11:12:32
I'm sure you can show your nephews and children someday all these fancy memes you posted when you lost a substantial amount of money.
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:59:21
"but I can assure you that it"
no you can't. With that attitude you are guaranteed to lose alot of money. You can cry afterwards about it here.
And adding "Lesson" to your title would imply you know something from experience. You don't you're just biasing yourself.
@_date: 2018-11-20 01:14:43
If you ask this question in a subreddit, no you should not.
@_date: 2018-03-19 15:14:41
This community has just become stupid.
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:07:12
I didnt say it crashes, i said that you guys are a bunch of clueless gamblers. lmaoooo
@_date: 2018-02-07 23:55:15
Aaaaand its going down. Where's the article.
@_date: 2018-02-08 14:48:22
No plus calling something recovering after a couple days is funny as well. Also depending where you look at bitcoins price in the past 12 hours you can call it either recovering or crashing, bad article is bad.
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:08:21
it goes both ways, not just down. I've seen more propaganda by bitcoin users than governments.
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:05:00
You did the right fucking thing, it's that simple. You got out before this ship is most likely sinking. We cannot know for sure of course, and it could go up but you just got out while you could.
Good for you, seriously.
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:09:56
Exactly. The difference is it's not as "cool" to buy crypto (and not as easy because of regulations and actual research). I can't recall that i ever heard a 16 year old talking and "investing" into stockbuybacks, but bitcoin... they can't fucking stop talking about it.
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:01:14
there's people like this all the time, they don't understand that noone can predict anything. The predictions are already in the market value of the coin. They make the noob mistake of thinking because they "predicted" by sheer luck once right that it will happen again. These people are not the ones that will reimburse you when you lose your money. It's naive idiots - sorry - that make other naive idiots follow and lose all their money. You have better chances to gamble everything away in a casino, it's just more transparent there.
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:11:35
Can you explain to me why the bitcoin value has anything to do with the success of it ? 
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:51:02
When did you buy ?
@_date: 2018-02-04 23:59:31
you're new to this are you
@_date: 2018-02-01 23:54:57
you will lose everything if you treat this ponzy scheme emotional. Dont say ou havent been warned.
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:29:23
Any good that is speculative in nature is just that: perception = reality. It's shifting money around, nothing is generated in the process anyways.
The technology luckily stays around nomatter the price of the coin.
@_date: 2018-02-10 11:28:51
Dragonballs meme's in investmentrelated topics. I'm convinced now that aliens just don't want to contact us.
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:02:54
Do you people understand that if you get a roi of 50 times more than you what you paid that 49 other people lost the same amount of money ? You do realise that there is no value created right ? You do understand that you're in this for gambling at this point and that you have been warned over and over from responsible people who actually understand crypto.
You have better odds right now to gamble just at a casino, it's just more transparent there. This is like the subprime crisis, people in way over their head, not understand what is actually happening but they find redditors that think all will be well, so yeah why not invest!
@_date: 2018-02-02 23:59:49
My god are you dense
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:33:41
I also didn't say that. I never invested in the first place but i'm interested in the technology. I cant give two fucks if people lose money while it's crashing. Play stupid games win stupid prizes.
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:22:13
That's not why people sell. People sell because the price is coming down. I'd wager that 95% of the people who have bitcoin don't even know half of what is actually happening. They are in it for the money and they will leave for the money.
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:53:22
It doesnt matter. You did the right thing and parted fools from their money, even if it goes to astronomical heights again it doesnt matter. You got out while you were ahead and have nothing to regret. the only right thing to do if you like your money. You can play roulette in a casino as well.
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:22:24
Yeah, 1 hour ago lol. Now it's under it :P My god, you guys are holding to every straw until you see it right :P
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:02:28
Again. If i win 100$ then others lose 100$ in this system. There's no thing in the world that makes this different, even if bitcoins rise to 1'000'000$ if you sell at that price someone (or rather alot of people distributed) lost 1 million.
If you cannot understand this simple rule of markets then you deserve to lose it.
It was said countless times: "only invest what you can afford to lose" for this very reason.
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:39:26
You're one of those cool guys aren't you. lmaaooo lol and -.-' Is this also the level of your understand of financial markets such as this ?
@_date: 2018-04-21 09:38:16
lol your comment is just as dumb as to whatever advice he listened to. I could come back to this once bitcoin crashes again, what does it proof ? Nothing. You're gambling that's all it is.
@_date: 2018-12-13 11:18:04
Also changed my life, i started to see more and more shitty low effort posts that say nothing, i'm also always on top of the current meme's because apparently those are important when it comes to financial decisions.
