Wallstreet does not shut down when a single stock crashes. End of story. Unless you can show/prove otherwise, which you can't, because it hasn't happened before.

Wallstreet shuts down when a single stock crashes? This is new to me. In fact, it's never happened before. **EVER**. I love bitcoin but god I hate the morons it attracts...

Not at all, I'm correct -- Wallstreet has never shutdown due to a single stock crashing. For some reason, a bunch of people took my comment to mean "Wallstreet never shutdown due to a market crash" but that's not what I said. I know wallstreet has shutdown due to market crash, I also know they've never stopped trading because a single stock crashed. 
Unfortunately, there are a lot of dumb people who have reading comprehension issues or are confusing things. It's not uncommon for people to be wrong, especially when they're not very bright to begin with. Reddit's "masses" are wrong *all the freaking time*. I see it practically every day. Just browse the defaults and look at the garbage that gets upvoted. That's because reddit's userbase is between 16-24 years old. Smart, but not smart enough to know how little they still know yet.

Wallstreet has never shut down due to a single stock crashing. Ever. Is this subreddit just really bad at reading comprehension? I didn't say "market" I said when "ford stock" crashes. As in a single stock. The single stock in my example, would be bitcoin. Coinbase only carries 3 cryptocurrencies so they *can't* represent the market, *in any analogy*.

It's sad I got here too late; a bunch of ignorant people upvoted you despite your incorrect and wrong analogy. Yes, I knew Wallstreet can stop trading. You didn't read or comprehend my comment. I didn't say "the market", I said Ford stocks. As in, **a single stock**. The entire cryptocurrency market didn't crash 3 times in 3 weeks, hell, Coinbase only carries 3 cryptocurrencies anyways.

Benevolent dictator models don't work here on reddit, where they forbid compensation for mods. Just imagine if there was some sort of financial incentive for things to go your way; you'd no longer be benevolent. Human nature will take over ...we're all inherently corruptible.
It's one of the reasons why libertarian ideology is a pipe dream. It relies too much of man acting in the self-interest of society when instead, he'll act in his own self-interest. All it takes is one greedy bad actor (person or corporation) to ruin it for everyone and bring the system crashing down. People are inherently corruptible so I am baffled how they think they can eliminate that corruption.

Happening once, maybe. Three times in as many weeks? Almost certainly.

Oh darn, how oh how did people buy bitcoin without coinbase? I guess bitcoin didn't exist before coinbase? That's the only explanation that makes sense.

Shutting down the exchange for any reason is unacceptable in my opinion. Do they shutdown Wallstreet when Ford stock starts to crash? It would prevent damages if they did. So why don't they?
It's incredibly unprofessional and after the last shitfest they pulled, I was lucky enough to move my assets out of there. I'm going to close my account down today. 
I'm done with coinbase trying to manipulate the markets.

Let's not pretend we don't have our own lessons to be learned. I'm a holder of bitcoin, big fan. But it's fun to watch those who got into this from the "down with the fed!" aspect, the libertarian facet slowly learn why fiat money has rules and regulations. They incorrectly believe such things are there only to keep tabs on its citizens, to control the money and to basically "keep the little guy down". Some of that is true, but it's not as nefarious as these tinfoil hatters would like others to believe. If you get scammed out of 10 bitcoins, you're fucked. You literally have no recourse. 
If someone hacks into your bank account and steals 200k, you will almost certainly get that money back, either by them being able to track it and getting the funds back, or by FDIC insurance, or whatever other protections your bank offers. Same with stock trading and just about everything else; there are protections in place to stop most fraud in its tracks. These protections do not exist in the world of bitcoin and a lot of people have learned the hard way that their investment is less protected than they had believed. And that's just the tip of the iceberg, more scams are coming -- older, less known tricks that will flourish in this naive fledgling game.
I guess my point is that at some point, society thought it was worth it to sacrifice some of their fiscal anonymity &amp; freedom if it protected their investments. They were aware of what they were giving up, but they figured the "cost" was worth it. It's interesting to slowly watch the same thing happen to bitcoin.
