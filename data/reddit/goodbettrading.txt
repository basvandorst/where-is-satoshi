Everyone wants to fix up and rent or fix and flip. The biggest challenge is finding the properties to fix-up. These are all fixer-uppers and vacant lots, etc. I'd recommend picking up some of the land for cheap prices and holding on to it.

Philadelphia is the 5th largest city in the US and only 1.5 hours away from NYC. Purchase:Rent ratios are great, and this is a perfect way to cash out on Bitcoins into a Hard Asset. 
Philadelphia is a HOT market!

The reason is that my prices aren't dynamically linked to the current market price of BTC (as of yet). My prices are based off of an exchange rate of 1 BTC = $600.00. 
CUrrent pricing allows me to absorb a 40% drop in BTC without getting picked off on my pricing, and it also leaves room for negotiation in the pricing.
Everything is always up for negotiation, but it is better to price things too high than too low as people never want to negotiate upwards! :-)

There are many out of state and out of country investors in Philadelphia, so it can't be too hard.
I have an accountant in Philadelphia who I think I can convince to accept Bitcoins for his services, and then he can help you set up a corporation and other paperwork that may be needed.  
E-mail me at BitcoinProps for more details.

Market is nothing like Detroit. Philadelphia properties hold and increase their value over time. It is one of the top US markets currently.

I did do a search. I've seen people listing individual properties for Bitcoins, but not a whole portfolio of properties. I also haven't seen ANY people who would accept both Bitcoins AND Litecoins. 
Do you know of any other companies who were offering this on a myriad of properties before us?
