do you have a good recommendation for non-segwit wallets? can I use a wallet like atomic, then send btc from them to electrum?

ok. I bought bitcoin and transferred it to atomic wallet. is there any way I can transfer it from there to electrum? I hope I didnt fuck it up ;/ atomic is asking for a password to send it and Im using the same one I use for atomic but its not working :( "transaction failed. please try again later"
