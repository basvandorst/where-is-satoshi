Wow, I am impressed with the attitude.
MS has a history of missing the changes Internet has provided so far. (Social media, Mobile Devices, Cloud computing, you name it)
I am optimistic that they have finally learned their lesson.

Apple realize what´s going on.  
When the time comes, I think it gonna be something more surprising, bigger and counter-intuitive than just announcing:
"As Today, Apple accepts BTC as payment method via Bitpay"  
What that would be? Beats me.

Bitgild.com is my favourite.

Brilliant! Wonder where are they from? 
Anyway, it opened eyes to the fact that it doesn't take a large percent of the population of Indian, Bangladesh and Pakistan to get exited and BOOM! Huge number of them already have smart phones.

Bank would pay you I guess?

This is something I am checking regularly. 
The first time I ever typed 'Bitcoin'  - guess where?
I would like to how  is doing on twitter? Can we get similar kind of statistics?

I´d like to see more evidence this transfer actually happened.

This whole Bitcoin thing seems to happening sooner than I could have anticipated. 
As soon as the user experience and security takes the next leap, the usage is gonna explode.

I am buying.

I especially enjoyed the part he mentioned how VCs are failing to see how them self could become obsolete as micro-investing takes off in large scale.

True. While this is great news - random people are not suddenly jumping on board and buying. 
But the momentum for the next bubble is building up.

In the times of desperation it feels good to hear what Andreas has to say.

Development, but I admit it´s been a while. Have the tables turned?

Thinking about the blockchain while I did heroic dose of mushrooms made me commit to buy more BTC.

Alright. So a financial institution would create it's own database based on blockchain concept for it´s own purposes. Say just keeping track on things.
Is it possible to take advantage of huge mining power of Bitcoin and still keep a database private? sidechains?

I don´t think they saw early on what companies like, say Vmware, AWS, Dropbox were about to do.
Yes, Azure is growing  but it´s hard to see MS as an innovator in the field.

I didn't. Nor have I balls to sell now after 20% raise. I´m bad trader so just keep holding. All in since June. 
@_date: 2015-05-31 16:26:33
I have Trezor and it´s great. Keep up the good work!

Adrian Macneil, Director of Engineering at Coinbase held a tech talk in December for Airbnb nerd meetup.

Alright. After good night sleep my alt -coins are back!

I had some DRK and bitshares there. Now showing zero balance.

Annoying background music. There's no need for it. Words are powerful enough.
