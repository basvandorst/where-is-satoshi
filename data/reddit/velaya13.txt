I respect you u/evoorhees. I agree in many of your views, I like your passion for the space and I value what you have done in the space.
Do you really think you understand the protocol and how to scale it better than the majority of the people that actually write the code?
This is not about "bringing the two sides together". This is about doing it right, even if the masses demand fast free stuff now.
Do you really understand what will happen to Bitcoin if there was a hardfork with not near full consensus (that we do not have at the moment and probably never will have).
I do not know what will happen, all I know is, I will keep my core coins and sell my classic coins. My little stack won't matter, but what if some more people would do the same?
Bitcoin is about changing the world for the better and we have to do it right. Why do so many people not trust the Core team to exactly try their best to do that?

Besides my day job I trade Bitcoin as a hobby (please don't judge me).
I would like to take vacation for the halving event to be able to catch possible volatility.
The problem is I have to apply for vacation time the sooner the better to avoid it not getting it approved.
I watch various countdown sites and they predict dates from early June to late July, which is too wide of a spread, since I can book 2 weeks max. 
Do you guys know a good way to narrow the date more down? Or what is the most likely date for it to happen in your mind and why?
