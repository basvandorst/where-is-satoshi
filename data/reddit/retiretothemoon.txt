And Quote, “I think one of the downsides of crypto is, computationally, it’s quit energy intensive”. .... Ummmm, there is no other way to read that... that is his opinion as a business owner and why he thinks Tesla won’t use them.
As stated, PoW and energy consumption is its weakness... and will inhibit adoption. This is what many large corporations think.

No... he said crypto will replace fiat, but Bitcoin used to much energy with PoW.
So correctly expressing what he said was, Bitcoin is doomed but low energy networks will continue and be the future

Did you listen to it? He says the quote I wrote in Verbatim. I wouldn’t ever use CoinDesk as factual reporting. It’s owned by DCG who owns Coinbase and many other PoW tokens. Listen to recording, he says what I quoted.... it’s also goes to show how CoinDesk (like every other news media) portrays their own biased view.

P.S. I'm not selling my crypto until my portfolio is a million
@_date: 2017-11-28 01:34:25
1 million dollars. Then I would start selling $200,000 per year and buy cash flowing real-estate. If I only sell $200,000 per year then I'm only paying capital gains on that $200,000 each year.

mortgage loan at 4.5%, Bitcoin going up 20% per week.... hmmmm...not sure that was the smart move.
If you wanted peace of mind, you should have sold 1/4 of your Bitcoin, paid down your mortgage, and always had that equity in your house if the shit hit the fan. But all of it! Good on you, you did much better than me, congrats!

Does the analytics site state that the base fee is 1 sat? Is that the fee to make a transfer?

Social Security - People invest money, and they wait to younger people invest more money and get their returns. 
The government - Taxes, people invest money, they spend, hope for people to have multiple babies so they pay more taxes. 
Crypto - Ether, Bitcoin, and the many other that will take over: Insurance, Banking [SWIFT], take over western union, medical, car dealerships, property real-estate, voting, etc. etc. etc.
Crypto's have actual economic value / Ponzi Schemes do not, that's all you have to know.

Even if they make their own coin, there is NOW competition. SWIFT and Western Union had a monopoly on international money transfers. That is why it costs $20 to $40 to send even $1 dollar internationally. 
Sure, if they lower their costs down to 0.00063 cents [like RIPPLE], then sure people will use their coin. The fact is that they can't; because all of their buildings, kiosks, and infrastructure will be redundant and they will have to pay for the infrastructure to maintain their private block chain.
The company that creates a user friendly application will win. Even if companies such as SWIFT and Western Union make their own coin, they would have to [HERE IS THE KEY], pay for the electricity and infrastructure to run the nodes! They would have to hire network admins and pay for the computer infrastructure which would have huge costs. 
COST must be accounted for in order to get profits, basic ECONOMICS.
The revolution of crypto and decentralization is the economics of it!
The [USERS] pay for the costs of transactions which lowers the costs to make transactions nearly zero. In IOTA's case, even more so, because to use the system you must verify transactions, so there are NO MINING FEE's and no transaction fee's. A private company can run and stay sustainable with out profits at the end of the day.
No centralized company can compete against decentralized crypto's, it's simple economics, and it's that in which separates it from Ponzi schemes.

I bought Gold coins 4 years ago. 4 oz @ $1,275. Today it's $1,286... 
I feel pretty damn rich with a $44 increase. However, I'm much more happy with my $47,500 and 315% increase I have made off of BTC, LTC, and Ether... keep your gold and shove it up your ass!

Understood, but private centralized company block chains can not be profitable against decentralized block chains... simple economics. 
Just like the internet boom there were thousands of ".com" companies. In the end only a handful remained and were dominant and held large market share. 
This will happen with crypto. In the end a handful will survive and boom like Apple, Google, and Amazon. The others will go to zero.
There were hundreds of companies using the outstanding technology of the Internet and Computer Programming. In the end though the survivors where they ones that can package that technology and market it, make it user friendly, and sell it. 
Imagine Google's search engine as their coin. Facebook's webpage as their coin. Amazon's webpage as their coin. 
Why didn't Walmart make their own webpage / coin to beat Amazon's. Why didn't AOL make their social media site / coin to beat Facebook's. You see, Amazon and Facebook packaged their webpage / coin and beat the industry leaders. 
Same with Taxi companies. Why didn't they implement the same technology Uber and Lyft did? They could have, just the same you say banks and governments will make their own coins. The taxi's companies didn't though, and UBER and Lyft disrupted their industry.
Can you IMAGE IF YOU COULD HAVE bought initial shares in UBER? The shares in which only accredited investors could purchase, not the likes of an average person?!? 
Well ICO's have changed that. You would be a millionaire ten over if you invested in Uber early on; and if you pick the right ICO, you will also be a millionaire ten over!

what is the average transaction fee on the Lightning network? Who determines how much is charged?
