I always tell my friends not to invest in Bitcoin money that they will need in a few months.  You just don't know where the market is headed.  On the long term it goes up, but it can go down for more than a year, like it happened in 2012, when there wasn't a single all-time high.
Nobody can take Bitcoin from you if you take good precautions (offline wallet or hardware wallet like Trezor) and make encrypted backups.  But security is hard to do it right.
I usually recommend my friends to start slowly with Bitcoin.  Your best option is probably Bitstamp.  You can buy some there and learn about how Bitcoin wallets work and how to increase the security and privacy of them.  Then you can keep buying more, slowly.

The richest holders are the ones that receive new money directly from the central banks.

I looked into this when it was announced on Reddit.  The draft of the protocol proposes a distinction between content providers and consumers.  Said it in another way: it isn't net-neutral.  To make things worse, providers have to subscribe to some kind of agents that are people who in practice can censor the content.
They had a good idea (proof of bandwith) and then twisted everything until it became a worse version than the current Internet.

@_date: 2014-04-27 22:54:54
I meant a permanently offline computer.
And even an offline wallet generated with a non-always offline computer is better than leaving the bitcoins in the exchange.  With the exchange you can lose your bitcoins if either the exchange or your computer is compromised in the future.  With an offline address, you just need to be clean at the moment of creation.  If your bitcoins haven't been stolen already from the exchange, you're most likely safe (but you never know).

If a handful of developers get to decide what the max blocksize should be, how is that a free market?  That is central planning.

Your bitcoin address isn't tied to your hardware.

- You can transfer money instantly (unlike ACH) even overseas and for free (there are fees for moving from and to fiat currencies, but it's still way cheaper than, say, Western Union)
- I wouldn't suggest bitcoins as an investment to non-geeks because it's risky and very unstable.  Your friends will freak out seeing corrections of 30%.
- Unlike credit cards, nobody can charge you for no reason.
- Nobody will be able to confiscate your bitcoins if you have them encrypted in your hard drive (think of a lawsuit or divorce, or that you live in a corrupt country like Russia)
- Quantitative easing, or any other inflationary policies from the Federal Reserve, won't have any negative impact in the purchasing power of your bitcoins (most likely they will have a positive impact)

Something like this will eventually catch on and that's why we are going to need fees.
I see legitimate uses for this, like preventing censorship.  But I feel bad about it because blocksize is an issue.  Rising the blocksize to 2MB isn't problematic, but rising it to, say, 100GB, will likely centralize mining and the risk of getting miners regulated with KYC rules.

I think we need something like a live CD Ubuntu distro with Bitcoin client and firewall enabled (and maybe with AppArmor or SELinux) that stores the wallet encrypted in a USB drive.  Have it automatically start Bitcoin client and Firefox with some addons (Perspectives, Torbutton, Noscript, etc.) and some default bookmarks (MtGox, Tradehill, Bitcoin wiki, etc.).
This would be easy enough for everybody to use.
I think that the current problems (trojans, complexity in installing encryption software, etc.) prove that Bitcoin cannot be just an application if we want it to be used by the masses.  It needs to be an OS (or a Linux live CD distro).

I don't mine because I don't understand its economics well enough.  Difficulty will go up, but so does price, so in the end I think it's worth it.

You can buy with credit card:

@_date: 2013-11-30 08:21:19
That shouldn't be a problem.  You just buy with your debit/credit card and the debit/credit card company will convert it to bolivars at the official rate of 4.3 bolivars per dollar (and probably a fee):
 
It looks like a good deal since the black market rate for the dollar is 6.8 bolivars per dollar.
I've bought many times with credit card things priced in euros or pounds and they get converted to dollars at the market rate.
I hope this helps.  También hablo español.

Bitcoin isn't deflationary.  It's inflationary, since new bitcoins are created all the time.  It feels deflationary because the rate of adoption is making it spike in price, and because fiat currencies are way more inflationary.
@_date: 2013-03-20 15:09:00
Keynesians think that central banks should inflate currency so velocity of money is increased.  They see the economy as a machine that should be continuously running, as fast as possible.  They see inflation as good and deflation as bad.
Austrians think that central banks shouldn't inflate currency because that works as a tax on the savings.  They see the economy as a balance sheet, where the more savings the healthier the economy is.  They see deflation as good (savings increase in value) and inflation as bad.
Bitcoin is based on Austrian economics and cipherpunk/cryptoanarchist ideals.  Krugman is Keynesian and therefore he thinks Bitcoin and deflation are a bad thing.
Ask yourself if you are Keynesian or Austrian (or something else).
Personally I think Bitcoin and deflation are a good thing.  If velocity of money stops in some communities, we have Ripple for that.  Ripple is mutual credit money and is based on the same cryptographic principles that Bitcoin.

In order to provide universal basic income, you need some entity that provides it, and that raises money.  If that entity is the Government, this is how it could work:
- It could raise the money with property taxes and related taxes like the Land Value Tax  since LVT and related are the only taxes that don't distort economic decissions, and the only ones that could be collected if a world with financial privacy.
- The Government then would distribute the raised/collected money to everyone with universal basic income.
Another posibility would be that the money is raised by another entity, not the Government, as a yearly crowdfunding project, and then the money would be distributed.
I'd rather prefer the second option, since I just don't trust the Government to collect taxes and then spend it on the right things.  Anyway, it would already be a huge improvement if we got Land Value Tax and universal basic income instead of the current system of multiple taxes with complicated exemptions, and de-facto/unintended ponzi schemes like social security, etc.

We need slow wallet services!  (I'm serious)
What Grandpa needs is an online wallet service that works like a bank in many ways:
* Transfers/payments take 3 days to complete, and during those 3 days you can "reverse" the transaction (actually, the transaction wouldn't be sent to the Bitcoin network for 3 days).
* You get an email from the wallet service every time you initiate a transaction, so if someone steals your savings you have 3 days to stop it.
* The slow wallet service could store the bitcoins in an offline wallet, making the service pretty resistant to cracking.  Since the service is slow, there's no need to have the bitcoins in online wallets.
What I'm describing is pretty much a bank.  Banks exist because people prefer trusting them to store their savings than trusting themselves to do it.
EDIT:  I mean these slow wallet services would be good as the equivalent of a savings account.  It doesn't make sense to pay a coffee from a slow wallet, but you can pay your rent if you schedule it 3 days before the rent is due.  If you want to pay for a coffee, use an online wallet in your smartphone.

I don't think the US Government (and likewise in most western countries) cares so much about the money supply and monetary policy as they care about keeping the money monopoly in the hands of a few crony institutions like the banks.
My guess is that the US Government is, right now, trying to find a way to centralize Bitcoin somehow, and keep the money monopoly of the banks in a different fashion.  They might try some "greenlisting" (whitelisting) / "redlisting" (blacklisting) combination together with KYC and AML laws so only banks and some other institutions can sell bitcoins to the public.

Ripple is mutual credit.  Mutual credit has existed for a long time and it's a good idea when money is scarce.

Use crypto whenever you can: Tor, I2P, PGP, etc.

Install a firewall in your laptop. 
Do one step at a time. I know it's a lot of stuff at first. You can become increasingly more private. 
Don't just give up like some people in this thread. There's something magical about being able to talk knowing no one else can read your private conversation with a friend. When I instant-message a friend using OTR crypto I feel like dropping a weight I've been carrying. That's the feeling of privacy.
