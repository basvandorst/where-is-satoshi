There's nothing "pretty obvious" about the bowl-pattern forming.  From here, the graph can flatten out and form a long sideways trading-range until its next big break downward.  More of a descending staircase than a bowl.  There's just no telling that a bowl is going to form or complete itself.  That's just one of the possibilities here.

Looks like we'll now be hanging on a branch, deep beneath the previous consolidation-bowl break-out point.  
Whew! 1,100 points of more dump than pump!  But from the down volume drying up here, it looks like the dive has again leveled off.  Sorry, no moon shots, today.  The launch is cancelled.

In classic chart-formation, the trading range will probably keep tightening as the price-graph flattens out a bottom.  Then the bottom will trade sideways, before it suddenly
collapses down through the floor to a sub-low, or starts to curve upward, again.  Take your pick of the two choices, because the answer can only be found in crystal balls.

@_date: 2018-08-05 03:04:56
The next consolidation support line is at approximately 6775.  If BTC doesn't pull out of this dive, there will probably be an eventual retest of the last 5800 lows, before any further attempts to rally.

Whoweee!  Who just slipped on the soap?
@_date: 2018-06-28 10:35:24
In this case, it just means three previous turn-up points in trading.  These are points where the price "briefly" found support before it rose higher. These points will probably be retested before there is enough buyer confidence for an upward price advance in volume.  Many times a short-term price-low will be tested several times to see if it will break through to a lower low.  If it holds support, the price eventually gathers enough buyer confidence to move higher (all other fundamentals remaining stable).  
A "floor" is formed by a relatively tight trading-range, extending over some period of time, sometimes as a sideways price movement, sometimes as a consolidation bowl, etc.  This eventually builds buyer confidence until the price can break-out to a new post-consolidation high or an ATH.  After the price breaks out to new highs, it will often slowly settle back to test the top of the previous consolidation range (the price breakout point).  If the price holds, at or above this "floor", it can then continue the confirmed rise with increasingly confident traders.  But if the price breaks through the floor, as it settles back to the top of the previous consolidation, then selling will increase and plunge the price back into the previous consolidation range, or even lower.  When this happens the previous "floor" becomes "a ceiling", as the trading price must fight to get back up and through the resistance it now represents.  This pressure is often caused by the action of sellers trapped above the price offer, who sell into all attempt rallies as the price reaches their bail-out points. It takes time to eat through all this overhead supply of desperate sellers and restore price confidence.  The BTC price chart would indicate that a tremendous amount of overhead supply must exist, as not everyone caught above the current price is a HODLer.

It's time to start watching, again.  Will 6000 hold?  The next

No, don't short, now!  That's not what I wrote.  Short when you get adequate confirmation, by way of lower-highs and lower-lows, that it can't get through next resistence at 7500.  Short from that point.  Should it suddenly break above 7500, dump the short, immediately, and take the small loss.  If volume through 7500 is high, then go long with another buy on what we'll assume to be a rise to the next established resistance point.  This is never a pure science.  You're just betting the mostly likely odds by knowing the previous resistence or support points and watching for the heavy or light footprints which buyers and sellers leave in their wake.
@_date: 2018-06-27 03:20:00
If it has already broken through $6K, once (which it has) the re-test

Never HODl a charter pattern with seven consecutive flags, achieved through a huge spike in trading volume.  That's was a screaming sell, last December.  If you missed getting out near the top, then you should have sold on the first dead-cat bounce, and waited to re-enter after a new high was achieved, or shorted after the cat began to fall again. Even if Bitcoin was at $40K right now, there was evident price exhaustion at December's blow-out top, which required traders to step aside.  HODLing without a strategy is like burying your head in the sand.
@_date: 2018-06-16 06:39:41
This is a trading rule that is used to avoid holding an asset while it drops from $19K+ to $6K+.  Indeed, it's VERY USEFUL and will always remain so.  Riding the bus through a screaming sell-signal (7 flags on a huge volume spike) means you're betting against extreme odds. Whatever the price was to be in the future, up or down, it would have been best to get-off and back-on, rather than staying in your seat, willing to accept a long ride over the cliff in wishing on a future star.  Bet with the playbook in hand. Cheers.
@_date: 2018-06-28 22:07:10
By September, my guess is that BTC will be trading within the previous consolidation range of roughly 4800-4600, which was 
formed over a period of 6 weeks in 2017 (from mid-August to early October).  Looks like we're finally down to the Siegfried Line.
@_date: 2018-06-25 22:02:55
The chart flag is wedging downward on increasing volume.  Should be the other way around.  I think it's still too early to count the chickens here.

If the 6400-6500 double-bottom is going to offer support, expect to see a very high volume flag upward.  Next,
watch for overhead supply pressures at 7400-7500.  If positive volume can't eat through this, then we're in another tight trading range. It is probably best to short this, if the trading graph makes one lower-high, followed by a lower-low.  At that point, you're probably not going to the moon without a further retest of 6535.  If it holds above this, as volume really dries up, then another long burst could see the price cutting through 7400-7500 resistence.
@_date: 2018-06-20 00:49:59

Today, BTC cut through 6K, like a hot knife through butter.

@_date: 2018-06-19 01:47:42

@_date: 2018-06-26 10:04:10
The volume is significantly higher but the price is wedging down.
You'd like to see the volume drying as the price drifts slower lower, until it finally pops with another volume burst.  What we have here appears to represent churning.  If all of this volume represented positive demand, the extra volume should be pushing the price up, sharply.  So it's not convincing me yet.
@_date: 2018-06-23 05:25:18

Michael, what you feel is never important.  You also "felt" you had to HODL back in January 2018.  Good traders never believe that they are right.  They look for signs of what the market is telling them.  There's enough chance for error in just attempting to do that.  It requires lots of experience.  The blow-out December top 
(I believe I counted 7 stacked flags on the graph) with its massive trading volume was a screaming top to anyone who has ever traded stocks.  Regardless of the later stellar growth potential for any such stock, you must step aside at such a moment.  If BTC ever sees the likes of that again, remember your experience and don't get greedy, take some of your winnings off the table, and wait to see what happens.  If you had done so back then (waiting to see a new break-out from the lofty price) you probably would have re-entered the gamble at a much lower buy point.  BTC trades just like a stock. It advances and declines on a mix of fear and greed, and the footprints of trading volume (demand).  So don't just dream on the future of a technology, or what might be in store for BTC's adaptation in the future.  Own and trade your coins for today.  Don't ever "believe" in any investment as religion.

If BTC is just a fiat casino chip, then I'd suggest you stop gambling, when you can't afford to lose more.

@_date: 2018-12-16 08:56:33
Yes, definitely.  When volume dries up in a tight trading range, which is not making new-lows, it usually indicates that a bottom is in place.  But you need to see a real burst of volume, as the price accelerates out of the gate. This is your only assurance that all are jumping in behind you for the run upward.  
An upward price movement, that does not attract a large increase in volume, will just fall back on its ass.  We haven't seen this kind of positive price-to-up-volume increase with BTC in many months.  Heavy volume without a price increase indicates churning between buyers and sellers.  That usually means that a top has been reached.  
Whether price has reached a short-term top, or a long-term top, has a lot to do with the angle of the upward spike.  The December 2017 price-graph was a blow-out top for BTC.  All upward energy was expended.  Its price-line represented a screaming sell signal.  By that time, I believe the price had gapped-up seven times in its final trajectory, over the course of only a few days.  After something like that, it's time to short.  But wait until after the next attempted rally fails to reach a new ATH.  
Beyond that point, making money depends on getting on-and-off the ball (going long or short) as the price-line descends toward the bottom of what will eventually form as the next consolidation trough.  
Then, rinse and repeat.

Trump has nothing to do with America booming, just like Bitcoin has nothing to to do with making money.

I think he means that $3169 is the new launching platform for BTC's long anticipated trip to the MOON (stratospheric ATH).  For some this may be difficult to comprehend, but many coiners still view their financial horizons in such terms.  "No-coiners" may be seeing the reality here as more in keeping with a journey to the center of the earth.

BTC just had a 35 point return on truly pathetic volume.

Do you think BTC will find price-support at 2875, the break out point from the last consolidation cup of any significance?

The BTC priceline is now down $15,880 dollars from its peak, less than a year ago.  You can get friction burns from that kind of slide.

It's 3.4k, now.  So I hope not.

When do we MOON?

Unless you short and we MOON.

Of course, HODL.  At almost 83% off the chart high, what's left to lose?

Yippee!  We've bounded back over $3200!  Is this take-off on that long anticipated trip to the MOON?

Which is the real one?  Which is the counter one?  The only true stability comes from the greatest amount of justice for the greatest number of people.  Everything else must be maintained through force and manipulation.  That is where we are, today.  In America, we trampled "promote the general welfare" under extreme personal greed.  This is what happens when a people lose control of their politics, and public policy serves only those who enforce the self-serving code.  A code that can only hope to maintain itself by dividing the opposition.

It was a retarded example in keeping with the retarded notion that BTC holds any real value, or has any long-term tradition of accepted trading value, by any known standards of speculation.

Yeah, catch a falling knife.  That's always attractive to investors.
Is the current price, "worth buying at or not"?  Well, show we the price-earnings ratio, and I'll give you my answer.  If there is no such
number, then I guess we're comparing apples-to-zeros.

A hole is as deep as the number of Bitcoin needed to fill it.

The priceline undercut support and then moved back up to the trading-range that we're now in.   The next stop on the way down, would be about $2850, last reached in May of 2017.  No saying how long or short a spell until then.  Three months of a tightening price-range failed to put in a bottom at $6K.  So, as always, there's just no telling.  But if the graph wants to complete the curvature of its current bowl formation, my guess is that the bottom is at about $1k.

That's the way you play the game.  BTC = trading range.

You can never have the degree of income inequality that keeps spreading and not experience an economic meltdown which leads to violence, and then revolution.  The cycle is endless in the history of man. Like the markets themselves, the story of mankind is one of fear, greed, and clan.  Rinse and repeat.

Yes, it's called "overhead supply" and BTC has a lot of folks just praying for a chance to get out even, swearing they'll never do it again, if they can just be lucky enough to escape unscathed.  The key difference between prior comebacks (in years before the 2017-2018 rise-and-fall), and the one that is hoped for, is that BTC has been widely exposed to the general public.  The average joe will not be discovering BTC as something new and rewarding.  Now, he will recall it as a bubble that burst and caused a lot of financial pain.  The market's buyers have matured to a new and widespread point-of-view. The man in the street is happy that he never joined in chasing the BTC star.
