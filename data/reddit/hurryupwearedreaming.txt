Okay so my balance should show up and I will be able to spend my bitcoins? I imported the seed and encrypted the wallet with a new passphrase but the address which contained my bitcoins did not show up.
Hopefully your solution will work. :/

Thanks for the brief explanation.
Is there any reliable tutorial on how to set up a wallet along with a NFC tag? I have done some research but I didn't found one, yet.

thanks for your help also!
I generated new receiving adresses and voila: my Bitcoins are there! :)
I'm lucky I made a paper backup otherwise they would be gone.

Is this still working?

Can you give me some information on how to use my (smartphone) wallet along with an NFC tag? What are the advantages?

Your business concept is awesome in my opinion. 
Seems like a painless process to purchase Bitcoin from Europe.
Where is the business registered? Doesn't KYC/AML regulations apply to you?
I'm signing up right now and I'd love to get a code for some start capital.

Hi! Thank you so much for doing this.

I hope you still read feedback so I will just post my opinion about your project.
1) No I never had heard of you. And that's the main issue! Bitcoin (and your project) really needs to be made more public and people have to understand how it works plus how the technology behind Bitcoin works. If anyone would know that paying for a simple product e.g a Starbucks Coffee with Bitcoin is as easy as with cash and even offers you a 20% discount, why wouldn't he want to use it if he can even save 20% at his daily stop at Starbucks?
So I think your main job is to do more marketing for your project, maybe you can make some flyers/posters or even a short Youtube promotion video where you explain people how to use Bitcoin in 5-10 easy steps, that's would really bring your project a HUGE step forward in my opinion.
2) Great idea, but on the downside it's for US citizens only. Next time I'm in the city I will try your app (I live in Europe) and hopefully I will be able to get my coffee with a discount.
3) I already mentioned some aspects in the first point. I really think your project needs more marketing to make people aware of the possibilities they are missing out by not using Bitcoin and projects as yours which are associated with it.
4) Show your potential customers that Bitcoin is a really useful alternative to cash payments by all kind of promotion methods, tell them the benefits of Bitcoin payments (tiny fees, "be your own bank", available 24/7 (not like a bank), almost no requirements to use Bitcoin)
Good luck with the further development of your project!
