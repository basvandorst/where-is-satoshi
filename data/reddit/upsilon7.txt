Some big shot in Korea bought and price went up.. what a joke
@_date: 2018-01-11 13:46:07
The very first one. From the ministry of justice. Which now is just an old news. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 06:29:08
So, is this the second rocket to the 20k?
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:23:58
This was my first big HODL and I sweated like a sprinkler. What a ride!
@_date: 2018-01-17 08:26:02
Sorry guys, I hodl my house
@_date: 2018-01-17 08:06:21
Sold means someone bought it, right?
Why afraid of crash when someone willing to buy it?
@_date: 2018-01-20 07:32:24
You need a time machine for that. Forward or backward either way.

Gov announced 4 hours ago. What month?
@_date: 2018-01-11 07:39:41
That is fake news. just go to naver.com and see english news. Our gov is serious. I'm thinking about move to Japan exchange.
@_date: 2018-01-20 05:12:06
So is it true that what lit this rocket is Trump's shutdown today?
@_date: 2017-12-29 03:32:38
That is true. But difference with piracy is in this case it has to connected to real world in some way for convert to local currency.
@_date: 2017-12-29 02:19:41
China also use Korean exchange.

'Defies logic'. Perfect description for BTC ����
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:05:57
My gut tells me last night's storm is not over yet.. Anyone feel the same?
@_date: 2017-12-23 06:17:47
Which there is none such. Then why are you not a billionaire yet? Whatever you calling it, it is just a guess. What I meant 'Gut' is that.  Don't be an ass for just an expression.
@_date: 2017-12-29 01:58:04
Yeah most of people still think that is some kind of computer file.
@_date: 2017-12-29 02:34:41
You're right. But gov is not banning BTC or internet. They are banning exchanges which is real brick and mortal companies.
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:52:37
Yes, I understand what you're saying. The reason I'm worrying is current Korean market's are full of short-term buyers who just wants to get a quick profit.
@_date: 2017-12-29 01:33:10
In here Seoul, people starts abandoning ship now, because most of them are speculators who just wanted quick money through btc, not believing blockchain tech. Now price will drop to what it has to be. Before the boom in Seoul, which was last November.
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:39:35
I wish I knew that too. If you don't mind rough ride, maybe now IS the time to buy.
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:58:47
True. What was I trying to say is, wildfire is dangerous. If you don't like to get on rough ride, don't. Wait for calm down a bit. I'm not a prophet. I can't predict a shit. Just know that recent's price change was dramatic.
@_date: 2018-02-02 07:53:52
That really is a good explanation. thanks for the link! Understanding tech makes me trust bitcoin more. ��
@_date: 2018-02-02 07:39:04
Haha thanks this actually  helped me to understand.
I was thinking like
'So, someone won a lottery three times in their life. Maybe this could be..?'
@_date: 2018-02-02 03:39:33
We should hang this guy upside down.
@_date: 2018-02-02 07:40:06
Thanks guys. I think now I understand the scales now.
@_date: 2018-02-26 12:36:34
Segwit, take us to mars!
@_date: 2018-02-22 23:57:05
This is Bitcoin's falcon heavy!
@_date: 2018-02-15 09:47:49
So this is how his everlasting waiting started..
@_date: 2018-02-07 14:04:48
Thanks. I remember read that one at this subreddit before. I'll probably check that  20 times before hit send with sweaty finger ��
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:35:05
TO THE SUPERNOVA!
@_date: 2018-02-07 13:58:18
I just pre-ordered a ledger nano s!
Just want to keep my coins safe while I hodl. Can't trust exchanges anymore.
