I like bitcoins, and i like loading ready run, and I always love humor poking fun at the conspiritards who will take up any lose thread and try to present it as a tapestry of deception and lies and cover ups.

not really all that dirty when you consider that if you have ever broken a law you are considered a criminal. We are all criminals, really.
The word has no real meaning considering how many laws we all break on a daily basis that no one cares about.

the vast majority of knowleddge can be obtained fairly cheaply if you live in a first world country. 
you can get a basic understanding of pretty much every feild out their from a local library books, and then learn even more from the internet.
the knowledge itslef is cheap, the perserverence to obtain it is whats costly.

I call it a group of people coming to my home demanding money at the barrel of a gun. Without any more context about who they are and why they are doing it and who *I* am and my relationship with them, i cant say anything else about the situation.
Do I owe them money? Have I just stolen a couple million dollars from the federal reserve? Are these guys just picking a random house and demanding cash from random people? 
Context is important.

The government could probably shut off the internet if it wanted too, you cant point a gun at the internet, but you can shut off the power.
Of course, it would probably never take such a drastic step (it would probably be political suicide), but the internet does not function only with math, you have wires and companies and electricity and all sorts of places to attack to bring it down if you truly desired.

I did not say it was a smart idea, just that they could if they wanted to.
