My point was that a company is just as ”real” and ”physical” as bitcoin. Companies are simply people doing things with a common goal, just like bitcoin.
Bitcoin, on the other hand, is decentalized, open source and the network is not owned by anyone, which means that there will always be people working on it and it can’t be ended by laws or governments. Companies can fail and cease to exist.

You are simply stating the bad outcome for both, but they both also have a positive outcome, which is equally likely. It could be eitherway for both parties and they don't know which way it's going to go, so it cancels out. 
As for the volatility itself, it will go down when adoption increases: in simple terms, the more people are involved, the less can one's actions affect the market.

If she truly is interested in investing that much, i’d suggest that she learns the fundamentals and basics of Bitcoin, so that she would understand why the price and ”crashing” from time to time is not a big issue in the long run. Also why crashing to zero is very, very unlikely. Andreas Antonopoulos’ videos are great for learning.

It’s making a lot of assumptions about how the network will evolve. For example, it assumes that any issues with LN will not be fixed along the way, and it will thus end up in a centralized banking type situation like it imagined in the end.
If there is any chance of the network becoming something like banking 2.0, it will be fixed.

Ah yes, the good old inherently valueless argument. It doesn’t mean anything. Bitcoin has the most rigid, largest, secure, decentalized network and the biggest brand, which makes it most likely to stay valueable of all. And because they’re all the same, it only makes the network effect more significant.
Dollars are also inherently valueless but people still agree that they have value just like bitcoin. Even gold is in fact inherently valueless, its value is based on the assumption that someone is willing to pay for it if you sell it. So it really changes nothing.

@_date: 2018-03-12 13:27:17
I was referring to the fact that the infrastructure is way more established, decentralized and it has the biggest bunch of enthusiasts developing it and the brand is widely known, which in turn means that there is a significantly smaller of a chance for bitcoin to be one of those coins that have billion-valuations for no apparent reason. These things might not strictly make bitcoin the best forever, but they’re significant factors that affect the future.
Normal people seem to think that bitcoin is equal to all other coins and that anyone of them could take over the world over night.
Actually, the fact that they’re all open source and largely the same only makes bitcoin’s headstart even more significant. Whatever ideas altcoins come up with, bitcoin can adopt the best. Not very fast, but it’s possible.
@_date: 2018-03-01 18:06:59

@_date: 2018-03-06 18:22:03
I think the point is that even though bitcoin has features that are not exactly environmentally friendly, that doesn’t mean that it isn’t worth existing. Proof of work is needed to make the network secure, which is essential for a cryptocurrency.
It’s like saying in the early 90’s when it had very limited use, that the internet shouldn’t exist because all the infrastructure and computers use so much electricity if it would become world wide.

This might shock you, but inherent value does not exist. Gold has zero value if you can’t sell it to someone. A dollar bill is worthless if it’s not traded for something else. Value is emergent in the service something has. Try not to pretend that this isn’t the case. 
The potential service bitcoin can do makes it valuable in itself. The service is guaranteed by the nature of the network.
@_date: 2018-02-18 11:12:41

Anarchy is a nice idea in theory, sure. But the reason it’s only an idea and not a viable structure in reality is that it will lead to chaos and inequality if money is still present in the system. That in turn will lead to the emergence of structure and hierarchy, because it’s a fundamental need for people to function together as a society. Hierarchy is a fundamental part of human nature, which is a psychological fact.
Or can you point me to an anarchical society that has ever worked out well and still exists today? It’s just an utopic idea that doesn’t work on a large scale.
Anarchy is just as bad of an idea as total communism, it’s just the opposite end of the spectrum. Hierarchy is

Stocks and the value of them is also backed only by the faith that someone will pay you if you sell it, which is backed by law and order. That is a very good backing, yes, but the value is not inherent in the stock itself, which is only information as contract bound by law. 
It’s also dependent on that all the money that the company is built upon has value, which only lead to the discussion about value for fiat currencies. 
I’m not saying that stocks aren’t valuable, just trying to say that even they don’t have *inherent* value.
Ps. I never said i see bitcoin as an investment like stocks, far from it. Just trying to explain why it has value beyond speculation.

Accepting bitcoin direcly is challenging for most merchants of any decent size because it’s not compatible with their existing accounting systems and they can’t use crypto to pay suppliers to buy inventory, pay their employees ect. That’s why merchants want to convert crypto payments to fiat directly. 
The adoption needs to be much bigger so that businesses can use crypto throughout their supply chain. Solutions like bitpay or coinbase are a necessary step towards that larger adoption in that atleast it introduces crypto to one point of the chain.

Bitcoin can and will become a largely adopted and used currency in co-existence with governments and taxation.

I’m not denying that the price can go very low sometimes, even lower than it is now. For me, the price is not the most interesting thing about Bitcoin.

A modem is the same modem for ever once it’s made, bitcoin is evolving. 
See, you’re thinking that bitcoin will forever have the same problems as it has now. Lightning network and other 2nd layer technologies are already being developed and deployed as a reaction for the current problems. With the LN there will be virtually no fees and instant transactions. It’s also possible to develop smart contracts on that and who knows what else.
At that point it’s technically possible for bitcoin to do anything altcoins can and all the other coins would suffer their own scaling issues if they’d become the biggest one. In this sense, bitcoin will always be the most battle-tested coin.
Of course, given that noone is in charge and it’s based on consensus, development is slow. However it’s not a bad thing, because it makes the network incredibly secure, which is what you want for a crypto.
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:09:24
Well bitcoin’s purpose is not to be an investment, it’s a technology. The price is the least interesting thing about it and it’s not competing with the dollar. 
I’m confident in bitcoin because it’s the most secure and battle-tested, with the biggest network effect and brand name. And if you think bitcoin won’t be improved, you’re just ignorant.

I’m sure no enthusiast is going to tell you it went to 19k thanks to the technology. Everyone knows it’s because of the get rich quick wannabes.

You don’t need to wait for confirmations, the payment is registered right away. With Visa the confirmation time is around a week or so, but it’s the promise of a transaction that’s enough to make a purchase.

My confidence in bitcoin mainly is based on the nature of the technology (security, decentralization and the benefits of that) and the fact that it’s software that is being developed all the time to overcome its problems. All kinds of things that we can’t even imagine can be developed on top of bitcoin, just like on the internet from the 90s - today. 
Swings in the price will happen for many reasons, but the utility will slowly but surely improve. By that, the adoption will rise and the relative price will be more stable.
Whatever swings we’ve seen lately are short term concerns, i’m thinking years ahead with a slow and gradual process.

If there would be war, disaster, government downfall ect, bitcoin would only become more valuable. For the same reasons why the price of gold rises when there is economic uncertainty. Like gold, it’s a way to store value when your national currency can’t do it.

There is still a need for a system theat redistributes resources to keep society intact. I live in Finland and the government is one of the least corrupt in the world and most people are happy to pay high taxes for the things we get like free univerity, free health care ect. I can imagine it’s not the case for the US where tax money is used to different things like an absurdly large military.
Who will pay for the infrastructure, health care and education in a society where everyone is not enforced to pay some share of being a part of the society? 
Rich people will not pay voluntarily, that’s a fact. Poor people won’t have money to pay for the basic needs like health care and education if it’s not supplemented to some degree by redistributing resources from everyone. The rich will become even more rich and the poor will become more poor, which always leads to conflict in the long run. 
You want even more inequality?

Most people who are critical towards Bitcoin see it only as it is today and base their reasoning for why it won’t succeed on what Bitcoin is today.
They see it as a finished product, when in reality, it’s software that can and will be developed over time to overcome problems. Bitcoin is like the internet in the early 90’s.
Another fallacy is thinking that in order for Bitcoin to be successful, it has to replace national currencies all together. This is just too unrealistic and will never happen. There is no reason it can’t coexist with fiat.
That being said, who the fuck knows how it will play out? Nobody.

I didn’t say that price reflects utility. The price is the least interesting thing about bitcoin. It went up in november because of hyped up get rich quick wannabes as it only reflects supply and demand. That doesn’t mean that bitcoin is not a useful technology.

I’m confident in Bitcoin specifically because it has, to my knowledge, the biggest network effect, biggest brand, most secure and battle-tested network and already having 2nd layer tech being developed and deployed.

3 steps? Why would you need to do anything other than putting your address out there?

I’m no hurry either! Throwing some leftover money on bitcoin once in a while doesn’t cause any anxiety about the price. 
In the long run, i’ve either lost some money i would’ve used on something else i don’t need - or i get nice gains. No need to go extreme in either way.

Why not?

The price is affected by the behavior of humans. Human behavior on large scales doesn’t change that easily. Therefore, it’s safe to say that the price will behave in the future like it has in the past, for the most part.

Fiat-currencies have always existed alongside each other and their relative values change all the time, of course, not as much as bitcoin. What makes bitcoin different so that it can’t exist in the same space and eventually become as stable as fiat currencies?
I understand that the argument boils down to that you don’t believe it will evetually become more stable, but i do.
If you’re really interested in bitcoin and not just arguing for argument’s sake, here’s a video that explains volatility and stability in bitcoin and what matters:

It’s guaranteed by being coded so that if both parties don’t do the transaction within a time period, neither transaction will happen. It’s either both or nothing.

Ah yes, shouting fucking communism and socialism makes all arguments invalid. That’s just stupid. 
Communism means that nobody should own anything and that the state owns all. It’s an extreme of the spectrum. Obviously that’s not going to work and it’s been proven historically. It’s not at all what i mean with redistrubution. 
What i mean is that just like a totally communistic society, a totally free society will not work in reality either because in a game of limited resources, inequality will rise exponentially if theres no redistribution and rule of law to enforce that. People who accumulate wealth will only accumulate more and they will become the power houses that the banks have become. 
Just see what happens with ISP:s in the US when they’re left unchecked: the bigger players will only eat up the small ones until they’re so big that they can actually excersize political power and control.

His whole thesis lies on the assumption that all governments will be 100% hostile against crypto. 
While in reality, a government (this case Canada) trying to figure out Bitcoin looks more like this: 
Those countries that are open to crypto will reap the rewards of jobs and innovation that the industry brings.

Everyone arguing about shit not being backed have a false understanding of the concept of value.
Marketing academics have been studying the concept of value for decades. Traditionally, it was seen as something bound to things, just like you hear people talk about ”inherent” value. 
After years of empirical research, the contemporary understanding of value is that it’s a subjective, contextual and emergent thing. Value comes from the *service* that something or someone does for people. 
For example, a dollar bill has zero value for someone who can’t exchange it to something else. Same with gold and everything else that people argue having ”intrinsic” value. 
When it comes to bitcoin, the (potential) service it can provide for the world is what makes it valuable. The service is ”backed” by the fact that the network is secure, unforgable and predictable. Therefore, bitcoin is in fact backed.

I’m not going to bother with the hassle of selling my crypto back to fiat, and i don’t need it. I’m just going to buy more.

It can be used to purchase things when it’s at $1 and when it’s at $10k. 1 btc is always 1 btc. Volatility will go down when actual use adoption and liquidity increases. For that to happen, the technology needs to still develop and it benefitted hugely from the sudden hype because it sparked development in solitions that will tackle future scaling issues.
Thinking that the purpose of bitcoin is to replace national currencies is delusional, they will always co-exist. No need to be either-or.

What a cheap trick to just straw man the belief in bitcoin with religion, when one is backed by math and a proven concept and the other on only belief.

Blockchain is more of a concept for how to organize a network so it works like a distributed ledger. Protocol means a specific way or a set of rules for communicating in a network. Bitcoin is a set of rules for how people can exchange info on the blockchain, whereas bCash, ethereum ect. have different rules. 
@_date: 2018-03-17 13:05:56
Altcoins will always exist because there’s no barrier to entry.

No one is denying that scaling issues are a thing. Bitcoin is being developed all the time as a reaction to them.

It’s an old man who has worked his whole life dealing with fiat money. It’s understandable that he can’t comprehend why a decentralized currency can work.

Why are you accusing me of anything when you don’t even know me? 
Do you even know any of the developments that are coming to Bitcoin? Value comes from use, and Bitcoin works just fine now and will be even better in the future as currency, store of value and many other things you can’t even imagine when 2nd layer technology starts getting adopted. You should probably learn a bit before talking shit.
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:53:52
That’s true. Personally, i’m not that concerned about what specific coin will be number 1,2,3 ect, because all coins will co-exist. I’m fairly confident that btc is a safe bet because it’s the biggest from the beginning and it has a lot of enthusiasts behind it. 
I’ve read that it’s not technically impossible to create a system where wallets automatically convert the sender’s coins to what ever the receiver wants. If a system like that would be developed, it doesn’t matter what coins you have. I don’t see why such a system would not be developed as it benefits the crypto scene as a whole.

That’s what i mean. If no one is in control, some kind of ism will emerge sooner or later. I’m not sure merely controlling your own finances will be enough to make an anarchy to work because it’s only one part of a society, which is why i’m sceptical still. 
I’m not doubting that Bitcoin will change many things, which is why i’m getting some BTC regularly too with no intention to sell. But i just doubt it will overthrow governments during our lifetime. Who knows what will happen though. Accumulating BTC is a good idea anyway.
@_date: 2018-02-18 18:04:16
It’s already implemented. What we’re waiting for is adoption.
