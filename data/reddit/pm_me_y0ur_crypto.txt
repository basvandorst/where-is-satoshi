The only real life experience I have is a friend of mine who bought in a few years ago and held. About 4 months ago I reminded him and he decided with the rise in market to finally sell. He was super excited as he would be making enough of a return to purchase a house, 300k. It was then that he found out the company (the wallet?) that stored them went bankrupt. No monies at all for him. Ugh

Can you imagine.. 
"Hey guys, I just cashed out 10,000 coins I bought in 2007. So, ya. I have like $100 Million dollars now."

I think its just fine some people dont approve. Lots of people thought the internet wouldn't catch on. No matter what we say, their will be naysayers. I'd rather put my effort into reading about new ICOs.

Can you still transfer to a different wallet? If you can, just transfer to a site like binance.com. I use that site to buy IOTA and XRP..

So, I just brought this up to my friend, all excited to try it later, and he said "so, they just get access to your computer? They're going to steal your info".. Now Im deflated.. Has anyone tried this website?

Quite a few folks are saying massive projections for bitcoin, like Mcaffe @ 1 million per coin by 2020 and others $50k per.. looking at the graph your sharing helps me understand their forecasts.. To the moon!
