Considering he hasn't been convicted, you really can't say he did. You're allowing media lynching to influence your idea of guilty vs innocent. RU is innocent until he has had due process and a jury says guilty.

Yes...? And? He hasn't been convicted of anything. He is innocent; due process has yet to occur. When they go to court and make a damning case and he is convicted, then I will believe it.

Accused. RU has not been convicted of anything, yet you are framing it as though he did it. Until a jury says guilty, RU is not DPR, he is an innocent man facing accusations.
@_date: 2014-04-20 14:58:35
He only has 200m if he is actually DPR (and guilty). So what you're saying is, "I'm not going to help him because I believe he is guilty." If he's innocent, he doesn't have those btcs you are referring to.

Oh I figured. The thing is, common people don't need to pay taxes for the system to work. It's more of a moral write-off than anything. The bottom 95% hold a very tiny portion of the wealth and income in this country (and in the world for that matter). The military is derived from (and serves) the have-nots of this country (the vast majority). They are the stick the have-nots use to smack candy out of the haves. Rich people kind of get their way by paying off politicians to have the military do the bidding of the rich, but ultimately the military is composed of soldiers loyal to the American people (their brothers, sisters, moms, dads). In order to successfully take control of the military, the wealthy would need to convince over half of the military power structure to put dollars before loyalty (a 51% attack?). It would be insanely expensive if not totally impossible. I guess we can't rule it out completely though.

Fiat is centrally controlled with virtually no democratic oversight or control. Bitcoin mining pools can be crippled by the very people that compose them (by switching to a different pool). None of the individual miners have any incentive to stay with the pool and let it perform a 51% attack. They would be screwing themselves over by making the coin they've earned from mining worthless. So it's actually a hell of a lot better than fiat.
@_date: 2014-04-20 14:52:52


He hasn't been convicted of anything. RU is still innocent. They haven't proven in court that he is guilty of anything. So yes, RU is innocent as it stands.

Soldiers don't see it as supporting the state, they see it as supporting the American people (their peers). They steal from the rich and give to the poor. Like Robin Hood. As long as resources are concentrated in the hands of the few, and the many are want, this is how it will remain.

The Military's power does not rely on dollars, it relies on force. No matter what form of currency the people use, you can bet the military will get theirs.

But if you don't have some key information (encryption method and key), it's not really CP, it's just a bunch of garbage data. It's not accessible to you so you aren't in posession of it. That's how I see it. Curious to see what the courts would say. If you learned that it was CP you just delete it, and have a user policy that no CP is allowed. Dropbox allows encrypted files. I'm not aware of them being prosecuted or even accused of hosting CP yet.

This Game Developer (who has been publishing one game per week for the last 6 weeks (although not right now, because his PC broke and he doesn't have money to repair it, from what I gather) was quite easily convinced to accept bitcoin donations, and he even plans on adding a donation link into his games themselves.

when it comes to security, there is no such thing as secure--there is only "more secure". In that regard, if you have a quantity of Bitcoin you plan on holding and do not need quick access to, put it on a paper wallet and store it in a safe location and delete the keys from any digital media. I think you did the first part, but it sounds like you still have the keys on your phone and the paper wallets are just serving as a backup? Phones are online devices and subject to penetration and potential theft.

Bitcoin is an incredible way to store value, strictly logistically speaking. You can store an enormous amount of value in a negligible amount of space, hide it incredible easily, transport it globally with ease without even needing to carry it with you. Send it to anyone in any fraction of value--although currently limited to 8 decimal places it is theoretically infinitely divisible with a software update. It definitely has uses.

"technically" correct is the only kind of correct.


That is not an adequate justification for putting the criticism in the introduction to Bitcoin. Additions should be defended, not removals. Please continue with your justification because you have not yet made an adequate argument in favor of the addition of the opinions in the intro. As far as I can see there is no strong reason for those opinions to be present so they should not have been placed in the first place. Opinion has a place, and that place is not the introduction to Bitcoin. What would I have to say to convince you to remove the completely ill-placed opinions from the intro, or are you simply completely unwilling to bend to reason due to your ego? This dialog is proving unproductive and a waste of time. If you were unwilling under any circumstances to change anything why did you even say anything? You may as well not even be an editor if you are afraid to make necessary and sensible changes.
I've made a strong argument for removal of the opinions (which I should not have to do, just by the way, the burden of defense is on additions not removals) yet you are unwilling to listen.

Actually what makes me tepid to the idea of a Bitcoin Black Friday is this:
Step 1: People see the great deals they can get if they buy with bitcoin, so they buy bitcoin with no fees off coinbase or where-ever else offers no fees that day.
Step 2: Price goes up continually throughout the day.
Step 3: People buy stuff with the bitcoins, spending most of the coins they bought. Retailers have to unfortunately fix prices at USD values because Btc value is augmenting over the course of the day.
Step 4: Retailers now have a bunch of bitcoins. Retailers exchange most of the Bitcoins for USD the day of/day after.
Step 5: Price plummets back to pre-Black Friday price, potentially causing a panic-sell, causing the price to go even lower.

I am simply stating that there is an alternative to your extreme example. If they say no then they go to trial for the original charges. Likely they will be convicted even without the additional evidence. That is how plea bargains work, since you didn't know.

A transaction is successful even without the confirmations. Confirms just provide extra validation that it wasn't a double-spend (which you can't do anyway except under extreme circumstances).

Fiat is controversial at an academic level (amongst, I would guess, more people than Bitcoin is even known by), yet there are no critical opinions presented in the introduction to the US Dollar. That's because the criticism is of fiat as a whole, not simply the USD.
The opinions presented in the Bitcoin introduction are not a critique of Bitcoin, but a critique of cryptocurrency in general and therefore belong in the article about Cryptocurrency. Perhaps the criticism calls out Bitcoin by name, but the principles argued against are the result of Bitcoin being a cryptocurrency, not anything unique to Bitcoin. This is where most of the Bitcoin community's ire originates from.

So why not "meter" or "dollar" or "cent"? Well, because all of those units already have an established and widely-used meaning. The same is true of "bit". A bit is a single binary digit and measures data. A bitcoin is a unit of its own which measures value. A satoshi is another unit that measures value. It is equal to one hundred microbitcoin, noted as ubtc, but more correctly µbtc. So 1sat = 100 µbtc = .00000001btc

There are no opinions presented in the introduction to the USD so I'm not sure how you think the analogy is valid.




Why is anyone's opinion offered? There is no need for opinions in the intro. Create a controversy section for quoted opinions if you think they are so crucial to the article (although they aren't).


Because you are only presenting one side of the controversy and you are doing so in an inappropriate place. The opinions given are fluff and completely useless when trying to grok the idea of bitcoin. It is additional information that belongs later in the article, if at all (although the opinions are critical of cryptocurrency not bitcoin, so they belong in that article which can be referenced by the reader if they want additional information on the abstract concept).




No, you are unwilling to remove unnecessary information because you support the bias implicit in the information. You do not belong in the position of editor as it is clear you do not understand that the burden of defense is on additions not removals. "It's controversial" is not a good reason at all to place some random opinions in the introduction to an article. The quoted opinions do *not* belong there. They do not add anything useful to the introduction, it simply makes the introduction wordier and less focused.

Awful lot of victim blaming going on. The guy who should be blamed is the thief that stole the coin. You don't blame a woman for her rape because she went out in a miniskirt with no panties. Just because a victim made a crime easy to commit doesn't mean it's the victims fault.

Yeah I thought that was odd too. Also she said if he sent too much it was a one way thing, and that is just plain wrong. That's like saying if you don't have exact change at a register you're fucked.

It's actually pretty easy, just ask if they take bitcoin when you go to pay. They will probably not know what it is. Give a brief explanation (electronic cash that you can send for free directly to any other person in the world without going through any bank or escrow). Lots of business owners have a bit of the libertarian bug and will be interested, especially cash businesses. Tell them to check out coinbase and weusecoins and coinmap or give them your phone number and say you'll help them get set up if they want. Make sure they understand there are bitcoiners who will come and buy from them simply because they accept bitcoin. Plus coinmap is free advertising.

It is relevant actually. The government won't accept taxes in bitcoin so there is always a point at which you'll need to convert. Also as far as gold being an example, in some places using gold as currency is actually illegal. The same could very well happen with bitcoin if a government sees it as a problem.

Why? Why did you buy in the first place if you thought there was a chance the long-term price would be lower than your buy price?

Bitcoin's intrinsic value comes from its use as a currency. It is divisible to 8 decimal places (theoretically infinitely divisible), and it can be sent anywhere in the world securely, nearly instantly. Plus, it is not controlled by a central authority, and it is finite in quantity. AND it occupies no physical space and can be backed up. These things make Bitcoin extremely valuable as a currency. Far more valuable than gold, which is heavy, difficult to store and transport, and incapable of being "backed up".

bitcoin is extremely divisible (in fact that's a big part of why Bitcoin is such an awesome currency) and you don't need to buy a whole coin at once. value is value. if a bitcoin is worth 1000USD and someone only has 500USD they can exchange it for .5BTC.
