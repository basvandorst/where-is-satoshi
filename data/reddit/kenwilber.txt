Bitcoin was created by a very vocal extremist minority. YOU are a guest at their party.

The email is phishing. I've gotten three of these, and when you check the link they give you to change your password, it doesn't go to blockchain.info.
I don't even have a blockchain.info account.

He *didn't* try to have anyone killed. The only people who are saying that are the FBI, and they don't have any evidence to take him to court with such a crime. They have stated that they WILL bring it up in trial even though they are not prosecuting him for it in any state. They want, more than anybody in the world to ruin his *reputation*, because he makes them look bad.

Cocaine isn't "illegal." It's illegal for some people to "possess."
For instance, the Stepan Company makes is the only company in the US authorized to import coca leaves. They produce and sell cocaine with it.

Hoping to meet some good people.

Great insights. Sounds true on all scales.
But power law dynamics are true too, on all scales. :)

The project is not dead. A new testnet is coming out shortly.
Shawn has a great presentation and knows what's up. StorJ is a good coin to invest in as an altcoin.

Great post. Can I get in contact with the author? I am writing a book about the same topic.

I read the ars technica article and there are numerous instances listed of him being too open. I read "altoid's" shroomery post, and "frosty's" StackOverflow posts. The bitcointalk website has obviously been recently defaced/torn down, (possibly!) by government hackers. But here is a screenshot where altoid uses his personal email address!:
So essentially, he did vaguely connect himself to being the administrator of the site if you connected the shroomery post, bitcointalk post, and his Google+, YouTube, LinkedIn, and StackOverflow posts. But then, how did they find him?
It seems that after they had access to the server, they followed the administration VPN route back to the Laguna Beach café's wireless network. Then what? The progression of evidence gets hazy, doesn't it? The only way they could have nailed down his location, was probably by tracing that same admin VPN route to his new residence as "Josh" paying cash for an apartment with roommates he didn't know. Only after they knew that address could they have gotten the Canadian border officials to seize the packages going to that address. And only then did they see his photograph on the IDs.

Quit your job then? Stop paying the mortgage? Yes. Start your own business underground. Create what YOU believe is valuable and get damn good at it.
The Matrix markets itself as inescapable. It tells you there is no where to turn, no way to abandon it... there is no good life possible "beyond" the machine.
Is that really true? Or is this just another abusive relationship?
The reality of love waits patiently for you to open your eyes... and believe you deserve better.
