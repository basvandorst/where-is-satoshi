Everything that can go wrong goes wrong including the Murphy's law going wrong. But that can also go wrong, so Bitcoin reaches 100k

In two weeks 4k, mark my words
@_date: 2017-08-11 09:09:18

What I say is if there where no consequences for stealing, there would be so much robbing that any society wouldn't work. Laws and repercussions for breaking them are the backbone of any society. They may be based on our morals and beliefs but they are strictly necessary. You might not steal or kill because of your principles but many others would do so if they did not face any consequences. As an evidence when lights go off or a catastrophe happens robbery increases a lot. *excuse my english

Laws do not prevent people from killing and robbing other people. The consequences of breaking the law tends to be what stops many people from commiting crimes.

7 years is like dinosaur era for poker. Any way if his claims where to be true he would be the top earner in poker ever. All of the other winners have actually some sort of trackable earnings, in online or live cash /tournaments, he has none. Just loses. Now, we only hear very basic poker from him. In the JRE podcast sounded like a whale, playing HU on stream looked and played like a whale. There is even videos from top poker streamers pointing it out. He could have made some cash in private games with famous people but not as much as he claims.

What you should have learned from that movie is how powerfull pump and dumps can be. I think Bitcoin could be subject to some market manipulation, so watch out folks. Sharks are eating Nemos for lunch

This guy claimed to obtain a fortune playing poker. But he is 
 a big whale in the poker tables. His dad happens to be a big fraudster. Now he will claim he did some millions on bitcoins or some other shit. Guy is full of shit. Hey not hating, good for him to be living the life he wants, but I wouldn't trust this guy with my earning lol.
