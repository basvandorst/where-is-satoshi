My nephew works for [insert one of world's largest finance companies]. Over last Thanksgiving, he said bitcoin is fool's gold and will be obliterated within two years by cryptocurrency. 
Interestingly, the next day, there was an article I'm sure you all read where someone already declared bitcoin to be of zero value.

A month ago, I told you guys this would fall to $6k in about a month and here we go. 
EDIT: Only on reddit does one get downvoted for being right.

So you're willing to wait 30 years for this to come back? And the electric car isn't king yet.
@_date: 2018-11-15 02:00:04
You like catching falling knives, eh?
@_date: 2018-11-21 16:50:56
No. I'm not stupid enough to invest in something that isn't backed by anything.
@_date: 2018-11-21 16:51:50
Not true at all but keep guessing. I'll have to check my other logins, though.
@_date: 2018-11-21 16:51:16
Apparently a number of people do.

That's my point. Redditors aren't even as good as half blind monkeys as they are waiting for the comeback which may never come.

Guys like you crack me up.

I own a restaurant that sits among some of the largest financial institutions in the world. AG Edwards, ScottTrade(now TDAmeritrade), Stifel, and more. Every single one of those customers warned me to stay away from Bitcoin and other crypto currencies and one even promised that in two years Bitcoin would be dead as their institutions will create their own something (I forgot what).

Who said I was investing in crypto?
@_date: 2018-11-21 16:53:33
Not as hard as I'm laughing at you investing in something down 80% in less than a year.
@_date: 2018-11-21 17:04:45
Obviously you have no experience playing the market. You don't buy when things go down. Falling knives are no fun to catch. Objects in motion tend to stay in motion.
But I predicted 4400 when the value was 8000 or so. Not the same as your story.
@_date: 2018-11-22 02:42:47
As we've seen over the past year.
@_date: 2018-11-21 14:40:25
Can't find my original post from 2-3 months ago but I had said this would hit 4400 in...about 2-3 months. 
@_date: 2018-11-21 21:34:32
Neither does stupid money. I said it would fall to 4400 but I don't recall if I thought it was going lower or bouncing here. We'll see.

Bitcoin has been going bad for 7 months now.
