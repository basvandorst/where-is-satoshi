That's pretty neat.
@_date: 2018-08-08 13:21:22
Oh, are we crashing *again*? Hm. Neat.
@_date: 2018-10-09 00:29:58
@_date: 2018-06-19 05:56:53
I mean actual vegetables.
It's a pain in the ass the get the chair in there, though.
@_date: 2018-06-19 05:55:27
Eww, no! That's where the veggies get washed.
@_date: 2018-06-19 05:52:14
Which way does the water spin when you flush the toilet?
@_date: 2018-06-19 05:53:38
Myth confirmed. Mine goes up.
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:55:36
Crazy like a fox.
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:41:48
Are you saying that you think the price will drop by 10K? Because that'd be really, really bittersweet.
@_date: 2019-02-26 22:12:17
It's there a sale going on again? I haven't been keeping up much.
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:39:41
I doubt it'll get that low. I'm just a newb, but I don't think it'll go below 8.5, and I'm guessing it'll be closer to 8.6.
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:41:00
That's what I'm thinking. I'd consider myself average, and 5K seems like a good interval for massive dumps. At this point in time, anyway.
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:32:58
I don't doubt that it'll be over 10K soon, and keep going, but I can't shake the feeling that it's about to drop back down to somewhere around 8.6 or so.
Or maybe that's wishful thinking.
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:56:56
It's probably just the fact that I'm moving basically microscopic amounts at this point, then. Usually no more than .1
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:44:43
Definitely not saying that- not by any means. It just seems like- as you stated- 10K is a sort of psychological... hurdle? Something. I'm real sleepy right now.
But anyways, I think we'll hit 10K, people will sell because it's a nice round number, the price will drop by several hundreds, and then we'll be able to scoop up that sweet sweet salsa.
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:51:49
If I miss the dip, it won't be the first, lol.
We share opposite views on how to treat our meager funds, though. In my mind, it's not a lot to lose so I'm gonna be daring. I can appreciate the caution, though. I'm sure I'll probably wish I had used a bit more soon.
At any rate, I wish you the best of luck in your endeavors.
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:38:49
I typically hodl, but I think I might just sell a portion- just to rebuy after the dip/correction/wave of panic.
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:55:16
I feel ya on that.
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:54:10
I think there are three types of people that sell at these moments:
1- I wanna sell just before X to get ahead of the dip.
2- X is a real nice number, I'm gonna stroke my ocd a bit.
3- I'm going to wait until just beyond X, that way I know it'll stick.
I guess I'm just a number 2.
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:57:42
I forgot all about China. Classic mistake.
@_date: 2017-11-28 08:04:01
I've got a good feeling about this one. I think we'll see a nice, several-hours-long dip of a grand or more.
 But my good feelings tend to only get me into trouble, so take that as you will.
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:47:25
Do transactions really fail to confirm that often? I mean, I see people posting about it a bit, but I've honestly never had one take more than a few minutes to confirm. Does locale have anything to do with that? I don't know if anyone near me that buys into "that damned pyramid scheme" that we all love.
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:54:48
I typically do, but I kinda wanna play with some of it...
@_date: 2017-11-28 07:49:11
If I'm wrong then I'll buy back in and cut my losses. It's not like I'm selling all of my stash- closer to 1/4. And, trust me, it ain't much.
@_date: 2017-09-08 18:44:17
FUCKIN REKT
@_date: 2017-09-02 17:44:43
As a newbie, I like to think I get the gist of bitcoin investment: Expect the dip. Buy the dip (every little bit helps). HODL.
@_date: 2017-10-15 14:22:02
Where can I use my btc to procure this and other similar shirts?
@_date: 2017-09-08 21:32:24
No tears. Only HODL.
@_date: 2017-10-15 16:41:49
Word up, and fo' sho'.
@_date: 2017-10-25 06:49:22
I'm not even sure dude's a hater. I really have no idea what's going on.
@_date: 2017-09-04 11:27:24
We have clearance, Clarence.
@_date: 2017-09-01 16:48:16
Have your friends shit in one of your hands and wish you well in the other, and see which one buys you more btc.
@_date: 2017-09-30 08:23:58
Is there / will there be a mobile version? Android specifically.
@_date: 2017-10-22 20:44:29
I feel that. I tried to stay within a couple hours of home, but I'm about 10+ away now, lol.
@_date: 2017-09-08 20:59:19
You buy. It dips below where you bought. *You buy more.* It rises later. Then it dips again. *You buy more.* ***You buy more.***
@_date: 2017-10-14 17:25:12
I had to reply to the one saying that paper money isn't widespread, and so will be the case with btc. All I could think to say was 'lol' though.
@_date: 2017-10-21 21:37:50
u/CardCollector1 was nice enough to hook me up with a shirt from his [store]( and what a nice shirt it is!
I've ordered a couple of other things, all paid for using my hodlings, and am super excited to receive them. This shirt is SO COMFY you guys. And I love the colors.
@_date: 2017-10-15 12:27:45
Yeah, I'm just waiting on a couple of bills to be taken care of. I'm not rich enough to stop worrying about those just yet! :-p
@_date: 2017-10-22 21:02:10
So, are you a union member?
@_date: 2017-10-15 18:23:57
Just due to fees. I purchased via coinbase, and it was 0.01391 LTC to transfer. I only know that figure because I'm actually buying more now, lol.
@_date: 2017-10-24 21:32:21
Thank you, sir.
@_date: 2017-10-15 17:03:32
Haha! Just saw your edit.
I like their designs, and I especially like the shirts that just have little infobits on them. Nice way to spread awareness.
@_date: 2017-10-25 00:44:58
What's embarrassing about it? I got all my stuff together for a pic.
@_date: 2017-10-21 22:19:15
Every little bit counts.
@_date: 2017-10-15 18:50:08
No problemo.
@_date: 2017-10-15 16:48:59
That's pretty frickin' sweet.
@_date: 2017-10-15 12:19:57
I was partially being sarcastic, but I still need more.
@_date: 2017-10-22 19:55:59
Ah, see, the contractor I work for starts with a K, and I thought KBR might be a different section of this company.
Here everyone wears yellow, but the color of their craft stickers change.
@_date: 2017-10-15 16:47:15
waaaat? You da man, CC.
@_date: 2017-10-15 14:32:54
Thanks OP. And happy belated birthday.
@_date: 2017-10-15 05:13:42
What, like a chigger weed?
@_date: 2017-10-21 21:48:08
I have no problem at all sharing the things I love. And, if the rest of your stuff is like this shirt, I will have no problem sending my friends to you to spend their btc- if any of them would believe it was a real currency!
@_date: 2017-10-15 18:28:54
That depends on how soon you want your transfer confirmed, and how much you wanna spend in fees. I'm a middle-of-the-road kinda guy, so I usually just go for the mid-range bidness. Decent speed, and not too costly.
IIRC, my transaction was confirmed almost immediately. Of course, that was yesterday. Who knows what tomorrow and beyond might bring.
@_date: 2017-10-25 00:44:09
What's cringy about it? You think I typically walk around in all bitcoin gear? Because I don't. I'm just gathering it all for one pic.
@_date: 2017-10-15 18:38:38
No problem. Good luck, and don't forget to hodl when possible :-)
@_date: 2017-10-24 20:18:34
Thanks again to u/CardCollector1 for the quality products! :-)
@_date: 2017-10-15 16:30:34
I tried to reply to your deleted comment to let you know that I'm not OP, and won't be taking advantage of that offer. I will, however, be purchasing something from you :-)
@_date: 2017-10-15 09:14:46
Someone feel free to call me a cunt and correct me if I'm off-base, but I'm gonna take a stab at this. I'm tired, and somewhat stupid, so bear with me.
On the very lowest level, bitcoin is just another form of money. It's exactly like the US dollar, or the British pound.
What makes it different, is that it does not rely on backing from any government or financial institution to give it its worth. It's somewhat anonymous, although not 100%. I'd liken it to actual paper money in that manner.
The reason that people are making money on btc right now is because more and more people are accepting it as a form of payment. The old rule about supply and demand? Yeah, that's in play. More people want it, so it becomes more valuable.
As time goes on, the value of btc will level-out, and it will become more stable as a currency. So if you wanna (try to) get rich, you should invest a bit now and whenever you can, and hold on to it for as long as you can.
I hope this helps you out some, and if you have any other questions, I'll answer what I can.
@_date: 2017-10-25 06:50:35
Thanks, fellow oldman.
@_date: 2017-10-25 11:30:43
Hey Phill, how are ya? Have you met u/oldmanwrigley?
@_date: 2017-10-22 21:10:49
You should look into it. I'm not sure what you're making, or what your retirement is like, but union membership tends to mean better of each. Plus, you'll never be unemployed unless you wanna be.
@_date: 2017-10-25 07:44:48
You don't know u/oldmanphill do ya? I've seen him around a bit.
@_date: 2017-10-21 22:33:26
Yeah, autocorrect got me, and I got lazy.
@_date: 2017-10-15 12:08:54
Bought 3 LTC when I bought into BTC. Just transferred them to my Trezor a little earlier, and now I only own 2.8 or something close to that. :-/
Guess I'll have to buy more. *sigh*
@_date: 2017-10-25 09:31:43
I think I'm gonna go as Hodl for Halloween. It'll be Hodor, but with some sorta bitcoin twist, and all I can say is hodl. So there's that.
@_date: 2017-10-15 17:12:13
Hey man, those are all of our earnings. Keep on keeping on, if you ask me.
Unfortunately, I'm currently in PA, and it's almost winter. I move around for work, though, so who knows where I'll be this time next year. Hopefully back down south somewhere.
@_date: 2017-10-15 10:57:07
Love it! I think I might set up a monitor in my room just to display this constantly.
@_date: 2017-10-15 14:14:45
Damn son, you work fast. Digging the changes thus far.
@_date: 2017-10-14 17:20:35
I just sent all of my BTC, LTC, and ETH to my Trezor from CB. Took about 20 minutes to confirm.
That being said, it was all worth less than 1K USD. I'm not sure what you own, but if it's more, it'll take a bit longer- if I understand correctly. I'm still pretty fresh to it, myself, but I believe mo' money = mo' data = mo' time and fees.
@_date: 2017-10-15 01:37:15
It doesn't look like anything to me.
@_date: 2017-10-21 23:50:18
I did a desk job for several years, and I ended up *fucking* hating it. I'll take the outdoors and work that makes you strong over sitting around under artificial light getting fat.
Plus, I make decent money doing stuff I enjoy.
@_date: 2017-10-25 07:42:23
Thanks yo.
@_date: 2017-10-15 18:43:07
Now that, I'm not 100% on. Someone else might weigh-in here, but I *believe* you can just set it and forget it. I'm sure there are certain instances in which you'd have to access them, but I'm afraid I'm just not educated enough to answer that question. I'm sure someone here knows the answer, or you might ask r/trezor.
@_date: 2017-10-15 16:24:43
I think I was just browsing your store. Lemme check my browser history.
@_date: 2017-09-30 22:59:25
I'll be waiting.
@_date: 2017-10-21 21:38:13
Nobody gets hurt! ;-)
@_date: 2017-10-22 20:32:43
We're about 1/3 done with a 3-on-3 gas plant here in NEPA. There are at least two more about to start in this state, too, of varying sizes. There are plants going up in KY, OH, IN, FL, AL, OK, CA, and (I think) TN. There's no shortage of you know where to look.
@_date: 2017-10-25 00:45:17
Thanks bud.
@_date: 2017-10-22 19:06:03
What is KBR?
@_date: 2017-10-15 16:25:41
No, I wasn't. But I am now!
@_date: 2017-10-22 20:11:31
I've been working on power plants for about the past year. It looks like I might be doing that for a while.
@_date: 2017-10-25 01:35:29
Still don't get the cringe though.
@_date: 2017-10-25 06:50:06
@_date: 2017-10-21 21:45:13
It is a [Steelman Pro]( It's awesome, if you keep it charged. I work 5 12s, and an 8, and it *might* last two shifts. I try to charge it every day for a couple of hours before I actually need it.
@_date: 2017-10-21 21:49:51
I'm a laborer, but I'm doing heat-treating at a new power plant. Probably going to join the boilermakers after this job, though. Gotta get dat retirement!
@_date: 2018-12-07 03:57:28
My prediction is that that's not right.
