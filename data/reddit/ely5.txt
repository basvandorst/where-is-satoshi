I actually successfully used 2 gift-cards at Papa John's. First one on the website, and I selected cash for the remainder. But when I appeared to pick up my pizza, the cashier was totally fine with changing the remainder to a second gift card. They didn't have a barcode scanner, so I helped out by reading out the card number and PIN. I think your guy was either lazy or incompetent to accept the 2nd gift card.
Also haven't had any problems using my gift cards at Burger King. They had to manually type them in but it works.

Authy works exactly like Google Authenticator on your smartphone, and so has the same exact disadvantages I've listed elsewhere on this thread. Worse, Authy allows you to backup your keys to their servers, which you access via your email. This is a BAD idea, as when your computer gets compromised, your email also tends to be compromised.

An attacker could have a backdoor installed on your computer. For a site like Coinbase, the SMS 2FA is used only for authorizing each computer, not each session, so coins can be easily transferred out. For sites like blockchain.info, if you stored your Google Auth backups on the same computer, the attacker could find it. Or if you stored a backup on your encrypted blockchain.info wallet on that same computer, they will just retrieve it and use your keylogged password.

1. Instead of "manually verify the SSL cert", I suggest you start using a password manager, which autofills in IDs and PWs only if the URL matches your records.
2. Password rotation is a bad idea. Never reuse old passwords! A password manager can help you generate new, unique and complex password regularly.
3. Using GV (or email) for 2FA is not secure. You claim that all cell carriers allow access to text messages through the internet... can you elaborate? I can only think of *sending* texts via email to cell-number which doesn't apply in your case.

Dude, I'm on your side. See my post up there that OP made a stupid comparison. I'm just saying he didn't state he used that particular bank.
@_date: 2014-01-13 09:59:41
That's 2-factor bitcoin, not 2-factor **authentication** (2FA). Let me try to explain why it doesn't make sense to have 2FA for wallets on your own computer.
The first factor for verification is your password. What the second factor does is authentication based on something you own. It can't just be another password that you type in because if your first password can be stolen (keylogged), chances are the second password can also be stolen. 
I'll use the example of the [time-based one time pin (TOTP) protocol]( on which Google Authenticator is based. The thing that you "own" is a **secret code**. On the client side (in your phone, or in those security tokens), the secret code, together with the current 30 second block of time, is hashed and truncated to produce a 6 digit TOTP. On the server side, say blockchain.info, they also have this secret code, and they also perform the same +time/hash/truncate, and checks whether it matches. When it matches, they can confidently say that the user trying to login also owns the same **secret code**, and lets you access their services.
Now, why wouldn't it make sense to use this TOTP as 2FA on your own computer to protect say your bitcoin-qt wallet? The simple reason is because in order for your local wallet to check whether your OTP is correct, it needs to have a copy of the **secret code**. Generally when a computer gets compromised and the attacker gets access to the encrypted wallet, this would mean that he will also have access to your **secret code**. Besides, once the attacker gets the encrypted wallet and has your password, he doesn't even need to care about authentication using the 2FA.
Thus, 2FA on your local wallet doesn't really help and only provides false security. The only safer method to protect your bitcoins is to store them offline in cold storage.
@_date: 2014-05-14 14:51:25
I don't understand your point. Isn't it an online wallet? So 2FA would provide extra security?

You should not be storing the backups of your google auth secret keys on your computer. The whole point of 2FA is to have a SECOND factor to authenticate yourself to a website. Normally when a computer gets compromised, your password gets logged. If you stored your 2FA backups on the same computer, they will steal that too to generate the OTP and you're screwed. 2FA backups should always be stored on a separate device, and preferably offline.

Wasn't the Sheep Marketplace fiasco about 40,000 BTC?
I think it depends on what percentage of the community gets affected. A bug generating a huge number of bitcoins will devalue everybody else's, and hence everyone would agree to reverse it.
That's why I used an ETF as an example. Let's say the BTC in that ETF belongs to individuals making up 60% of the BTC community. In that case, it could be quite easy for people to come to a consensus to reverse the fraudulent transaction. Don't you think?

I say that because it feels like the thief was at your computer, saw the BTC in the wallet, and then very hurriedly typed in 5.2 BTC to send to his own address, ignoring the small change.

WARNING: Using 2FA software like this on the same computer you are accessing the website in question with defeats the whole purpose of 2FA, which is to have a separate device that authenticates you.

It is not recommended to do Titanium backups of Google Authenticator on your android phone. This is because if you accidentally install any malware, it could retrieve the backups on your SD card without requiring root, and hence steal all your 2FA codes.

Seems like you didn't enable 2FA on your blockchain account. [This would enable an attacker to download your encrypted wallet just by using the identifier, and perform brute force decryption offline.](
If you think they got your identifier or encrypted wallet through your gmail account, you can check the IP addresses at the bottom right corner of gmail that says:
    Last account activity: 10 minutes ago
    Details
If you do not recognize any of the IPs, make sure to sign out all sessions. Otherwise, even though you have enabled 2FA and changed your password, the attacker might still be logged into your account.
While it might be too late to recover your stolen coins, you should try to identify the method the attack used, so that you can prevent further attacks in the future. It's possible that the attackers have a backdoor installed on your computer, which no 2FA and secure passwords can protect against.

As everyone else already noted, wallets can handle multiple addresses automatically, so no need to consolidate manually.

Bitcoin addresses are RIPEMD-160 hashes of the public key. Public keys and private keys come in linked pairs. Someone who has the same private key as you will have the same public key, and the same bitcoin address. The OP is talking about different public/private keypairs having the same bitcoin address. And yes, if someone else has a keypair that maps to the same bitcoin address as you, he would have equal access as you.

Sorry for the loss. However, I must say that I'm surprised that you who took the precaution to use Lastpass, encrypted volumes, and Linux instead of Windows, didn't know about 2FA.
A few tips for you. It's great that you are using Lastpass, but you are completely missing the point if you reused any passwords. The whole point of Lastpass is so that you can easily use complex and UNIQUE passwords for every single online account. Lastpass has a convenient tool called "Security Check" that checks all its entries and warns if passwords are reused or not complex enough.
Also, 2FA. Probably the most important tool and I highly recommend you enable it for all websites that offers it. Importantly, Lastpass offers 2FA and you should enable that immediately because if your Lastpass gets compromised, that is major trouble. You can start using Google Authenticator as your 2FA, and perhaps buy a Yubikey to use as 2FA for extra security.
Lastly, I want to note that by default, Mint does not get security updates to some important packages quickly, and hence might not be safe for online banking. 
@_date: 2013-12-26 05:57:37

With all the talk about Coinvalidation, we are all reminded to avoid reusing addresses. But if you have lots of old transactions, in Electrum you have to scroll far down before seeing a new address. Now with 1.9.5 it hides used addresses into a subfolder so new addresses are always visible!
All changes here:
# Release 1.9.5

* Put addresses that have been used in a minimized section (Qt GUI)

This scammer messaged me on localbitcoins to try to buy a huge amount of coins. Then insisted on me using the localbitcoin transaction service and told me to fund it. Then he told me to see his buy ad and sent me a link on the site "locabitcoins.com". I didn't notice the missing "L" at first and clicked on it. Luckily I use LastPass, and when it did not autofill the userid and password, I realized it was a phishing attempt. My 2FA would have prevent this attack from working as well. Another reminder to everyone to enable 2FA!!! 
If I had funded the transaction, revealed my password at the phishing site, and did not have 2FA, the scammer would be able to release the bitcoins that I had funded at the click of a button!

This looks right. This block alone has a transaction volume of 117,000 BTC. A large number of them are in 3000-5000 BTC chunks that were last moved on 2011-03-02. So 117000 BTC x 1024 days = ~ 120 million bitcoin days destroyed. Upvote this guy to bring the answer to the top!

Do be careful how and where you back them up though. If you store it unencrypted on the same computer that you normally log in to online exchanges/wallets and that computer gets compromised, the attacker could get both your password (through a key logger) and possibly find that backed up 2FA private key. The best practice is to store backups encrypted and on a separate device, offline if possible.

1. Get a Yubikey if you want stronger security than Google Authenticator. Smartphones can be compromised as they are connected to the internet. [Example is this guy that got 11 BTC stolen despite using his iPhone for 2FA.](
2. The Yubikey is VERY durable. I believe a car can run over it and it will survive. You can drop it no problems. Smartphones can definitely break more easily than a Yubikey. Smartphones can also get corrupted or fail in terms of software (especially if you flash new ROMs frequently).
3. Your smartphone can run out of battery. Yubikeys don't need batteries.
4. I don't worry about losing it as I put it on my physical key chain.
5. Regarding backups, you can load it with your new desired private key and keep a backup. 
6. It is more convenient/faster in a way. I just touch my Yubikey and the OTP and a enter key gets written into the prompt. Faster than unlocking my smartphone, pressing Google Auth, scrolling to the right line, and typing that 6 digits in, and hitting enter.

This sounds good but there is a small issue: the bank fee of 15 cents per transaction. I know it is small, but for small transactions around $1 worth or so, it becomes a 15% fee, which is significant. If this autobuy feature is implemented, I would only use it often if Coinbase waives the bank fee for autobuys.
On Coinbase's end, they can choose to internally accumulate some of your small autobuys before ACHing your bank if it helps with their bank fees.

I've used it before on big ticket items and saved a significant amount of money on repair/replacement. Now, if Newegg gives an extra discount (say 5%) for paying via bitcoins instead of credit cards, it might level the playing field.

I read that if it was fiat money that was confiscated in a drug bust, the agencies involved will split it after the conviction. In this case, assuming they have access to the private keys, they could also spend it, or at least convert to fiat, after DPR is convicted, in maybe a year or two.

1. Get a Yubikey if you want stronger security than Google Authenticator. Smartphones can be compromised as they are connected to the internet. [Example is this guy that got 11 BTC stolen despite using his iPhone for 2FA.](
2. The Yubikey is VERY durable. I believe a car can run over it and it will survive. You can drop it no problems. Smartphones can definitely break more easily than a Yubikey. Smartphones can also get corrupted or fail in terms of software (especially if you flash new ROMs frequently).
3. Your smartphone can run out of battery. Yubikeys don't need batteries.
4. I don't worry about losing it as I put it on my physical key chain.
5. Regarding backups, you can load it with your new desired private key and keep a backup. 
6. It is more convenient/faster in a way. I just touch my Yubikey and the OTP and a enter key gets written into the prompt. Faster than unlocking my smartphone, pressing Google Auth, scrolling to the right line, and typing that 6 digits in, and hitting enter.
So for all these reasons, I like to use Yubikeys more than Google Auth. It all depends on whether you feel your bitcoins are worth $15 to pay for extra protection. One downside is that there are only 2 OTP slots, so at most you can use it to secure 2 sites that uses Google Auth.

Transactions unconfirmed for a few hours is likely due to insufficient fees. When you pay at physical stores using say the official bitcoin client for android, the fee is automatically calculated in and thus should confirm on average in 10 mins.
That being said, most experienced people receiving bitcoins will be fine seeing the unconfirmed transaction, as it is not trivial to set up a double spend, which is what the confirmation protects against. And so far, I don't think anyone has ever mentioned fraud via double spend in stores.

Actually I've looked all over and this is the closest quote to what I can find that Tom seemed to have referenced.
"No, I don't understand my husband's theory of relativity, but I know my husband, and I know he can be trusted." - Elsa Einstein
She probably never understood how it worked, and I think it will be same for bitcoins when it comes to the intricate cryptographic properties. So I think that's what Tom is saying, that he trusts the smart guys that bitcoin has all the properties described. But it's cool he is comparing bitcoins with something as revolutionary as relativity.

It might be refreshing to the latest price for 1 BTC, but it is NOT the price you are paying if you are buying more than 1 BTC. For example, I've been doing this to test.
Put 1 BTC into the buy amount, subtotal is $734.47. Price on top shows "Buy for $734.47 each".
Put 10 BTC into the buy amount, subtotal is $7359.60. Price on top still shows "Buy for $734.47 each", even if you refresh by pressing it. The correct price it should be showing should be "Buy for $735.96 each" instead.
Try this yourself!

Yes, but you can't tell how much you are paying per BTC unless you open up a calculator app and calculate manually. And by the time you come back to the coinbase app, the price could have already changed.

So I searched the input address on blockchain.info, and I see that someone had sent out 0.0001 BTC to hundreds of addresses (you can trace back by clicking on the inputs), and left on these hundreds of transactions a blockchain.info public note:
    NOTE! Bitcoin Wallet transfer Canceled (double charging). 
    Please send the Amount xx BTC to Wallet ** 1xxxxxxxxx ** to release the transaction.
I believe it is someone trying to get newcomers to foolishly think their last transaction did not go through due to double spend, and to resend the amount to the scammer. You can see that the amount of BTC the scammer requests in the public note matches the last transaction that occurred for each of the target address. Hope nobody falls for this!

Very few sellers will accept debit/credit cards because of the risks of chargebacks. The very few that do, will only sell very small amounts, and also charge a very high premium (10% or more) to offset the risks of chargebacks.

What phone number are you talking about that is involved in other scams? If it's the 480 area code number that is [listed on Godaddy]( that belongs to  not the scammer.
Also, wanted to point out that this is probably the same [scammer that tried his luck with me last week]( as the phishing site is identical.

So 2nd factor authentication (2FA) is what you use to verify who you are on websites. A free implementation would be Google Authenticator installed on your smartphone. When you log in to most websites, you supply your username and your password. If your password is stolen, you're screwed if you don't have 2FA. If you have 2FA enabled, the thief won't be able to log in even if they have your password.
You have to be careful which 2FA to use. Using email as your 2FA is a BAD idea because if your computer is compromised, they likely have access to your email. Using your mobile phone as 2FA via SMS or Google Authenticator/Authy is better but theoretically smart phones can also be compromised by attackers through the internet. [A recent example is this guy who lost 11BTC despite using SMS for 2FA on his iPhone.](
So the best kind of 2FA is an offline device that cannot be hacked. The Yubikey is a tiny usb device that you plug in vis USB and the PC treats it as a keyboard input device. There is a little gold contact that when you press it, it will output a counter-based OTP as text directly into the prompt.
There are 2 OTP slots on each Yubikey. One slot is that counter-based OTP which works with blockchain.info and Lastpass, amongst others. The other slot can be configured to be a time-based OTP that will work with sites that works with Google Authenticator. 
What a Yubikey looks like, plugged into a laptop. You touch the gold contact and a OTP gets generated.

Level 2 verification requires a 30 day wait after first transaction. This review seems to state you can become Level 2 immediately after the first transaction. It's going to disappoint a bunch of people.

The lady says "Bitcoin is unique in that it uses cryptography to verify that units are not spent more than once."
I believe that is wrong. Credit card (and probably all digital) transactions are carried out with some kind of cryptography. The main difference is that bitcoin uses a decentralized public ledger (block chain) instead of a single trusted 3rd party.

Genuine question: If you don't convert the BTC you receive via Bitpay immediately into fiat, do you still have to pay a fee? And if so, why use Bitpay then? Why not just directly receive the BTC into your own wallet?
@_date: 2013-12-10 12:37:51
So you still pay the 1% fee? Do you also provide an option to pay directly to a BTC address you control?
@_date: 2013-12-30 08:58:24
The price per BTC near the top that tells you how much each bitcoin is to buy/sell still doesn't update!! Same problem from previous version!
It seems the price shows what it would be for 1 BTC exactly, no matter how much you are actually selling/buying.
So Coinbase made their app prettier, but didn't fix an important problem from the previous version. Fail.

Many sites do that... like Groupon and LivingSocial. You're gonna give them your email anyway when you buy. If you want, just give a fake email to check out the site.

@_date: 2013-08-26 23:11:28
If you guys have funding, you can considered giving out small amounts of bitcoins so that people have an incentive to set up a bitcoin wallet and start bitcoining. Perhaps use something like this  although the minimum of $1 seems a little too much for a freebie.
@_date: 2013-09-13 00:11:35
Okay, but what about the reviews?
@_date: 2013-11-30 02:26:51
Yeah... shouldn't have used the word Nigerian. This scam lies that your transaction didn't go through and attempts to make you send it to them instead.
And yes, that 1E34 address belongs to the scammer and seems to have received 0.0499 BTC. So either that's one of their victims, or it's the scammer himself moving money around to save some face that their scam is successful.

What if the Chase Quickpay is tied to another non-Chase bank account? I've used it before and the money I accepted gets directly deposited via ACH to my non-Chase account (in 2 business days). In the event of a chargeback, does Chase have the right to debit your non-Chase account without your permission?

Yes, it's a phishing site. Please report it at 
I suggest everybody use a password manager like Lastpass, so that firstly you can have unique and complex passwords for every website, and secondly, since they autofill the id and passwords based on the URL, they will not fill in for misspelled phishing websites so you will know immediately.

If you mean you sent BTC from blockchain.info to a paper wallet you printed from Coinbase, they WON'T show up in your coinbase account.
"Any bitcoins sent to your paper wallet will no longer exist in your Coinbase account — they will only exist in the wallet. Consider this an export."
