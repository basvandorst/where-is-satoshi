I'd just like to interject for a moment. What you're referring to as Linux, is in fact, GNU/Linux, or as I've recently taken to calling it, GNU plus Linux. Linux is not an operating system unto itself, but rather another free component of a fully functioning GNU system made useful by the GNU corelibs, shell utilities and vital system components comprising a full OS as defined by POSIX.
Many computer users run a modified version of the GNU system every day, without realizing it. Through a peculiar turn of events, the version of GNU which is widely used today is often called "Linux", and many of its users are not aware that it is basically the GNU system, developed by the GNU Project.
There really is a Linux, and these people are using it, but it is just a part of the system they use. Linux is the kernel: the program in the system that allocates the machine's resources to the other programs that you run. The kernel is an essential part of an operating system, but useless by itself; it can only function in the context of a complete operating system. Linux is normally used in combination with the GNU operating system: the whole system is basically GNU with Linux added, or GNU/Linux. All the so-called"Linux" distributions are really distributions of GNU/Linux.

Yeah, I'd say Bitcoin has real potential to explode there

Oh Jesus fucking Christ, are you serious?  Are you seriously comparing a dude giving his opinion on the news to a fucking ISIS hostage who in all likelihood has been beheaded at this point?  
I seriously cannot believe someone took the time to make this comparison.  Bitcoiners have turned this shit into a fucking religion, and this kind of shit is exactly why nobody takes Bitcoin seriously.  I'm sure the family of this hostage is so much more likely to accept Bitcoin as a legitimate currency now.

Nice to see you had to throw that "rarely" clause to appease the hivemind and assure them of your conformity.

I love their Grateful Dead archives.  Wonderful quality, great music, all for free.

Well, considering their name originally meant Magic: The Gathering Online eXchange, they're more of the exception that proves the rule.
