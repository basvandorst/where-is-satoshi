No, what they meant is they will have support for bch network and allow withdrawal only. No purchase or sell. Educate yourself on facts before writing.

Businesses work on people trust. You fuck them, they learn, they fuck you. That's what Coinbase is doing and that is not how an efficient company should work.
I am going to move on Kraken.

Because they didn't announce it. Roadmap 4 days ago didn't have anything about implementing BCH. They did it without giving any anticipation. This is a serious insider trading and they just lost a lot fo credibility.

Don't buy on coinbase, commission fees too high and bitcoin prices higher than market price. 
Put ur fiat on coinbase, move them on gdax (owned by coinbase and free fund transfer between the two). There you have cheaper commission fees and market price
