Good for you! Me myself hope to recover about 5 BTC from an old crashed hard drive, but the odds are against me. Be patient and be happy with your newfound wealth!

Pfff just did a BTC withdrawal at HitBTC....and had to pay a fixed fee of 0.0007 BTC (about 12 US$;  crazy money)... Been waiting for hours. looked up the transaction, and they used a fee of 158 sat/B  for a 3 Million dollar transaction (of course not all mine...) . Seems that we 'll all be waiting for hours and hours.

444 left of that wall at $17250.. most of it eaten, maybe some of it withdrawn from sale.

Thanks Shro70, sometimes the answer is really quite simple. Will use that method. 
I still wonder why, when using the Hardware Wallet option, Bitstamp chooses to ignore the also available Segwit account. Oh well...

Just did a SEPA withdrawal at Bitstamp this monday....the money arrived safe and sound the next tuesday... (admitted: not millions, but still 4 digits worth) 
I'm starting to think the OP is all about the FUD 
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:17:48
Nobody has a clue?

One should consider a Hardware wallet... and your sheet with keywords in (a few) very safe places...

i most certainly did ;-)

Bought in at 10001 EUR :-)

which fee did you use? How many satoshi/byte?
It's probably stuck in the mempool (currently about 32k transactions are waiting to be confirmed and the miners will confirm the large fee transactions first.)
look for yourself:

You'll end up with about $97 USD worth of BTC...
...due to the fees that Coinba$e is charging. Better read up and use GDAX (way less fees, but a bit more challenging to start with)
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:56:24
Another great way to check for the appropriate fee is to look at the details on this page: 
If i read the chart correctly a 60-80 sat/byte fee could result in a 45 -1380 minutes transaction time (at this moment ± 14:00 GMT)... you could be waiting between 5 and 120 blocks (there is a new block approx every 10 minutes)
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:22:17
Maybe buying $ 20 once a month will save you on transaction fees... Also set up an account on GDAX to get much better fees than Coinbase is charging. Read up!

you need an app on your phone in which you can buy/sell/place orders/cancel orders.... Bitstamp (EU) offers this, but i'm sure that other exchanges have same offerings.
O, well, it brought you a nice workout!

Wieeeeeee! That was fun! Had some limit buys that were automatically executed by this small dip. And now the Rollercoaster car is already back on his way up!...
from 11.2K to 8.8K and now already back at 10.2K in just a few hours. 
Bought the dip! 
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:31:53
hopefully not looking at 7K EUR tomorrow morning

I can recommend Bitstamp.net , registration is straight forward and you can SEPA the money you wanna use on their exchange in euro's.  Trading Fees are quite decent at 0,25% ... you can also deposit your BTC to your (new) account over there and withdraw the balance from there... They will Sepa the money to you (they charge you € 0.90 for a SEPA withdrawal.

and...we start over again... it tumbled to $ 9930 within a minute on GDAX.
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:03:36
that was a sweet dip... glad to see it live. gobbled up some more coins...
