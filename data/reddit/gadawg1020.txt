Trying to wrap my head around hash rate. Is hash rate a proxy for difficulty? Seems to me that hash rate is related but only part of the answer. Don't we also need to know the time or rate to find new blocks? Thanks for any insight.

Bitcoin for political donations. Isn't this the purest form of free speech? And doesn't it make the concept of campaign finance limits meaningless? Why even have the concept of 501c3 organizations as the gatekeepers of the funds? Let people send the Bitcoin directly to the service provider - in this case the attorneys. If I buy the service of an attorney at the EFF aren't they obligated to keep everything anonymous - something about "Attorney client privilege"? Yet another example of why Bitcoin is an incredibly empowering enabler of liberty.

In US, selling BTC at a loss can be used to offset other investments you've sold at a gain. (capital losses offset capital gains)
You can write off a loss in BTC from your wages but only up to $3K. (capital losses offset ordinary income)
Anything over $3K you can save for next year. (carry over)
One tactic in event you have capital gains in other areas - maybe you sold stock for a gain or traded BTC thru the year and have some gains - is to take any BTC losses you have on paper and use that loss to offset any gains. Otherwise you'll have to pay tax on gains.
You can re-establish your BTC position in 30 days and the IRS will let you use the loss to offset gains. (see wash sale rules)
Happy hodling.

I've been assuming trading BTC is treated like a security since IRS provided guidance way back in 2014. I haven't looked to see if they've updated. Mining operations by the way are treated like ordinary income.

Worth establishing a definition of "intrinsic value" which is objectively one of the most fundamental - and underappreciated - concepts in stock investing. 
The entire investment community could benefit from a rigorous study of it's application to crypto. "...security analysis attempts to value a common stock independently of its market price. If the value found is substantially above or below the current price, the analyst concludes that the issue should be bought or disposed of. This independent value has a variety of names, the most familiar of which is “intrinsic value.” - Graham

This might be the truth, but it's not the whole truth and maybe even some important omissions. Chase Paymentech processes credit cards for businesses. If Chase Paymentech has banned a company from using credit cards to buy Bitcoins, I'd say that's a valid business decision for Chase's card processing business. Why would any business allow consumers to buy Bitcoins with credit cards? I applaud them for shutting you down.

Nice. I would suggest two flavors. One that can be used by individuals, in which case you change the copy to "me" vs. "recipients". And another that can be used by merchants, in which case you can customize "recipient" with "this merchant" or "&lt;insert merchant name&gt;". You can also use passive NFC tags that are read only by an NFC enabled phone. Build the business logic into the smartphone app that removes any perceived complexity associated with the Bitcoin address.

"anything involving Bitcoin" is simply FUD from a disgruntled merchant account. Most of the comments took the bait and reference this impacting their personal accounts and Coinbase as an example. There's more to this story that OP is leaving out. If Chase's actions represent an action against selling mining hardware only they should be held to account. But to leave the impression that personal accounts that are buying and selling Bitcoin is over-reach by OP.

You're causing more FUD around Bitcoin than is necessary. Many consumers are moving money in and out of Coinbase from personal Chase accounts without missing a beat. You should clarify in your post that the opinion of a single rep from Chase may not be one of the largest bank's official position and stick to the facts - your account was closed. I'm suggesting this for the benefit of the broader Bitcoin community. It doesn't do any of us any good to have this kind of uncertainty involving one of the world's largest banks. Accept Bitcoins and chalk this up to experience.
