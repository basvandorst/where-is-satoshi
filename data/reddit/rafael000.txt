just finished reading the book [Digital Gold]( (highly recommended!) and it's ridiculous how amateur was the Mt.Gox operation. The guy is a completely idiot.

You buy, but don't store there. Get a wallet. Either a mobile app, a desktop app or a hardware wallet.

it's called stop loss and stop gain. they work relatively well for stocks, but BTC is too volatile and you can end up either selling or buying by "accident" in one of the many sudden dips or spikes during a day. so be careful.

Really good book you almost mentioned there. "the signal and the noise" by Nate Silver
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:08:07
looks like a regular point to me

Can you update the table with iOS or Android compatibility? Thanks!

Wait 2 weeks

no idea, I don't use coinbase, but it must be in a "bitcoin transfer" section or something like this. you'll have to input you wallet address, so get that first.

let's do a 2018 version

nice, I once stayed in an Airbnb apt just above Room 77 and saw the Bitcoin logo they have in the bar's window every day.

Any tips on where to buy it for a fair price in Brazil?
@_date: 2017-10-19 02:26:56
Cool. Will check out if they have any in São Paulo.
@_date: 2017-10-24 14:22:24
I had a great experience in Madrid during my vacations. There's an amazing Spanish startup called bit2me.
@_date: 2017-09-10 17:25:02
cool, I'm going to Madrid and hope to find many stores accepting bitcoin and even some ATMs
@_date: 2017-09-08 03:20:49
Don't just hold. Use some to enjoy life today.
@_date: 2017-06-26 17:34:24
It's hard to see something like this in a huge city like São Paulo, so I wonder how many people in Campo Grande actually hold and make transactions in Bitcoin.
