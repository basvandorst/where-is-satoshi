So...they're hoarding it, they're just doing it in the guise of paying their employees with it. Considering that its value has dropped 30% in a month, I'm going to bet their employees are in no rush to transition over... Good job though, you really check-mated me on that one.
You've ignored every point I've made and your only rebuttal is overstock.  This isn't about vision, this is about cult like adherence to an idea in spite of objective and real issues. Bitcoin could prove to be a potentially novel idea and I hope it does catch on, but not when fanboys like you are regurgitating the same bull shit talking points while jamming your fingers in your ears to valid concerns and the objective reality of how its actually being used, it's doomed to stagnate and flop.

@_date: 2014-04-08 21:22:24
You and every one else spilling this drivel are missing the point. It is not a currency if it is given for an asset and the person selling exchanges it for fiat. It's just like me paying with gold, oil, produce, etc. It's a barter. When the person selling the goods sell them in btc then turns around and BUYS MORE PRODUCT in btc then it becomes a currency status as that transaction has just completed an economic cycle.
You have nothing to base your claims on except for hearsay and hype. There are no reports that have measured the adoption rate of BTC in any business, much less a given sector or industry. There are no reports stating the volume of sales those that *have* adopted BTC have done in BTC, and there is no measurement of who has used BTC to procure goods with it after the initial transactions, thus leading to an economic cycle. The only numbers you have accessible are block chain, market cap, and index volume. Market cap and Index volume are your two largest indicators of the over all health of BTC in terms of adoption and use and both have been rolling straight down up until they jumped off a cliff half a month ago. [Your better measurement of health shows BTC lost 10% of its market cap in less than a month]( 
You are talking out of your ass.

Yes...I know. Because its the only two examples that anyone comes up with, and like you said, its only rough numbers given without scrutiny -- a far cry from a trend of any kind. Both companies are well developed and have the luxury of accepting btc as a way to attract a niche clientele base, however neither company restocks using bitcoin. They might as well be using coupons to lure people in. Good for them on their success, however the only thing they prove is that bitcoin is still being exchanged for fiat even when merchants have the leeway to use it as a currency. That indicates that it is still worthwhile for a business to use fiat over BTC for ordinary day-to-day operations. 
"But just you wait, it'll be amazing. Any day now. The world over will use it. Yup, any day. We'll never have to deal with fiat again"
The longevity of BTC rests on people convincing them selves of that despite there being little to no evidence of its adoption. The only money flowing into BTC (and, it seems, back out) are start-ups looking to take your transaction fees because the only activity for bitcoin is in trading. 
@_date: 2014-04-08 00:31:44
Simple question:
My credit card has fraud protection and can be cancelled immediately after theft. My cash, by its nature of a physical item, is (for the most part) inaccessible to others. 
Why should I use BTC? 
If my business only has an option to trade BTC for a fiat currency and I'm unable to buy my product with BTC, why am I adding an extra step except to advertise to a niche customer base? Why should I use btc?

I agree with your point about decentralized hot spots. I'm ok with that. The idea in the original thread came across as making cyprus *the* place for bitcoin which, based on the reactions of western banks to cyprus processors, would be a bad idea for the global adoption of btc.

Unless the UK Tax rules apply to the rest of the world, anything they say is largely a moot point in regards to the overall discussion.

@_date: 2014-02-21 03:29:24
What? 
My point was that bitcoin's reputation is poor and thus won't be seen as a suitable method of transaction in every day business, something that appears to be the end goal of BTC users. Yet the market treats BTC as a commodity by constantly staking bets on its value. That identity crisis is one of the many reasons its a shit show of volatility and rumor mongering. 
@_date: 2014-03-08 16:59:00
No but the fact that you brought that up about Nigeria is a testament to the effect these things have on a country's reputation. Considering that BTC is being plagued by negative connotations and the end goal is to have it widely accepted the world over, centralizing it to a country equally plagued by shady dealings will not help that in the slightest.
Not to mention your comment ignores the fact that cyprus transactions are red flagged by western banks all the time. So how does that help when people want to purchase BTC via their local fiat through cyprus registered processors? (since its not going to just appear out of no where)

You are naive to think the fluctuations of BTC don't expose businesses. Currently most businesses exchange their BTC into fiat because there is no economy for BTC. Ideally, a transaction made in BTC will stay that way when the business buys its product using the same currency -- Reality is not that way though. When a business sells a product for X BTC but that value can swing significantly in the span of minutes, hours, and days, that exposes the owner to significant losses (or hell, even gains) on that transaction when it swaps for fiat. Even the gains are a nuisance because now you have to account for them in your taxes. Say they do hold on to BTC and try to establish the economic part of it. How do you run a business when your currency has a tendency to halve its value on a quarterly basis? Just take a step back and ask: How many people are willing to leave the comfort of fiat for this shit show?


At what point? I see you and so many others justifying the wild west of BTC yet its just that wild west reputation that will stop it from ever progressing further. You don't just shrug and hope for the best down the road. 
@_date: 2014-03-08 17:00:50
Sure, if bitcoin is used as an actual currency and not as a commodity to be traded out into local currency. Assuming its a paradise of BTC use and everyone adopts it in lieu of the cyprian currency, how does the cyprian government cope when tax revenues plummet? 
@_date: 2014-02-21 01:45:02
Oh you've really check mated me here. What with the vagary and smarmy comments. Who said anything about buying it? If you read my post (and I doubt you did), you'd see I said "adopters", not speculators.
here, let me quote it for you


That was before the colorful language part which I'll spare you from. So sorry.
By adopters I mean the businesses that would like to utilize BTC as a potential method of transaction. The first exposure they get of BTC will be via the news and word of mouth. Currently, the reputation of BTC is not so hot and MTGOX is making it that much worse. 
You talk of how bitcoin is the next logical step beyond, I'm assuming, fiat yet people have zero reason to step out of the comfort of the norm if their alternative is only shown to them as a perpetual bubble machine. This is the part where most people start flying off about how fiat is so much worse, derailing the point that BTC is still being shown in a negative light because the media and population at large, unlike , do not pick and choose what they see and know about cryptos. It *has* been a perpetual bubble machine and until its backed up by any economic worth, it's just speculation and thus, just a gyrating money sink like any other commodity out there.
@_date: 2014-01-28 18:07:13
While its altruistic to think this can happen -- Even self regulation is regulation. Thus you'll have to take the wild-west out of the BTC market before you get a change in mindset from BTC operators. However most of the folks adopting BTC are doing so as a commodity, a buy and hold idea that BTC will appreciate to X level and make them millions. That gimme-gimme attitude works well with exchange fees.
Welcome to the reality of financial markets.

Cyprus is the Cayman islands of Russia and probably one of the most red flagged financial centers of the world. They were also one of the first to apply a haircut to deposit holder accounts when their sovereign debt hit a critical point. Why would you want to attach that to bitcoin? 
@_date: 2014-04-14 13:04:53
Yes, well its directly correlated to your volume and market cap.
@_date: 2014-04-08 18:03:58
I don't 100% agree here. From an objective point of view, it's been used as an asset/commodity like any other out there. There is no economy of bitcoin that isn't based on a translation into fiat, and so its just been something mined out, hoarded, or traded. Regulators can't make judgments on future plans of something, especially something as new at BTC, so their only option is to rule based on what they see in front of them.

 At a fundamental level there are *technical* safe guards, which are great but not perfect, but that's not where my main grievance is.
it simply is not an investor friendly asset or market and that isn't helped by the naivety and ignorance of its user base who smugly declare it perfect or such a fantastic alternative to the current system based purely on faith, rumor, and a series of never ending 'if' statements.
There has been little to no objective evidence that shows BTC as a viable vehicle for either every day investments, or a currency to be used by people the world over. It's failed on both fronts. 
@_date: 2014-04-08 01:02:29


It *might* be cheaper for merchants, but it has no effect on my use of a credit card, unless you're implying I don't need to pay taxes.  This still ignores the fact that I have fraud protection and the ability to cancel and fight transactions done with a stolen CC, still something that is not generally possible with BTC.
and all of your other points hinge on the proliferation of bitcoin to businesses which is to assume the people are demanding it of businesses, which while the initial demands of businesses may be there, I'll wager that there is little to no volume of people actually using BTC to pay for things once the business has begun accepting it. There are exceptions such as overstock, sure, but those are far from the average experience. I would actually really like a comprehensive study done on not only the implementation costs of BTC for a business, but also the effect it has on the volume of said business. Its things like that that will sell it to fence sitters, but people are too caught up on hype to be practical.

Take your money out of your bank, go home, and throw it at a wall. At least when you do that, you can pick it back up again -- in stark contrast to the risk in cryptos. Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend you invest in *any* thing.

...you mean like today? I don't understand how you don't see the significant of today...
Because of the low concentration of BTC, ONE company now makes the majority of BTC trades with only a couple others offering competition. This firm has been hacked a few times now and today's example illustrates just one of the many risks that hacking can have. The guy sold a ton of BTC that didn't even exist causing the entire market to tank. One guy, one firm, tanked the entire market. You can't seriously compare that kind of risk to the currency market. And if you do, then you have no concept of how massive and liquid the currency market truly is. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 01:00:56
Well...no. There is *risk*, yes you are correct, in all types of investments. Be it systemic, or non-systemic. There are ways of approaching the spectrum of risk, but once it reaches a certain point, you're blindly guessing -- and thus gambling. How exactly does one diversify away hacking risk that can cause a systemic crash in the currency? 
Look I don't care if anyone buys BTC, hell I've given it thought a couple times. But don't pass it off as an investment. I see people saying "Well I treated my money as burnt when I put it into BTC so I'm enjoying the ride." That's either a psychological defense or they're gambling. But its certainly not an investment.
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:19:01
Yup, p2p can still happen. Trick is getting RMB into BTC without using a 3rd party processor or bank to transfer funds from your bank account to the BTC service. Or, selling your BTC and switching it back into RMB and depositing it in your account. So that means you have to go off-shore with your Yuan to buy BTC.

You people are retarded. Investing covers a wide range of things whether it be buying something and selling it later or receiving passive income. When you buy a bond, it can be both a coupon and lump sum payment in one (among other things.) If I am buying it and planning to sell it later, I am both receiving passive, guaranteed income and selling it at an expected decrease in yield = appreciation in price = profit. That covers both of your terms but in one action -- as in, it's not black and white. Do you think buying a business to improve it is pure speculation or is it fair to say that it's a unique investment that encompasses a wide array of assumptions arrived at by a significant amount of research? You can invest in *anything* based on your goals, the asset, the macro environment, etc. etc. All of that should be weighed before your money gets deposited some where.
What BTC is is *gambling*. You have zero predictability of BTC. Will it go up? Maybe. How do you know? What are you basing it off of? Do you understand the main catalysts for its growth? How do those catalysts effect it in a quantitative way? When will your too-big-too-fail trading house have its control wrested away from it by competitors? If ever? How do you know DDOS is only a temporary thing and not a full on gaming of the system by an organized group? 
The fact that you consider it a currency and not a commodity is a whole other issue but it is growing purely on speculation derived from publicity. It's almost Ponzi-ish in nature at this point. You just had your currency devalue by almost 50% in 6 hours because of a DDOS, and you're telling me that the risk involved isn't gambling?
