I put 1% of my net into crypto a few months ago. It is now 30%. And my savings have also increased in that time. I have been mining as well though. 
I think you would have to be crazy to not have at least 1% of your savings in crypto right now.

Woke up this morning to green arrows. It was nice.

I have no problem paying tax. I think it's important to support the country where I live. I pay 100% of my taxes and wouldn't have it any other way. 


I never said you could do it on coinbase. 
CAD to BTC right here -  (as you probably don't know XBT is how some places write BTC)


That doesn't matter. I don't care if you think it's valueless. I'm telling you I've already traded like 20k for USD this month. I'm not fucking over any system, I 100% support the system and the government. YES it's overhyped. I never said it wasn't. That's why it's so easy to sell. 
Lol shit I responded again. OK this is the last one for real. Dude you need to calm down. Why do you care so much if other people use crypto? Nobody is forcing you to. You have to learn to not get so upset over what other people do. 
Anyways, for real I'm done. You're not responding to what I'm saying. You're claiming I'm making statements I'm not. I hope you have a nice rest of the day, try to get outside for a walk or something man :)

I never said I think digital currency has more value than anything. What I will say is I've made more money this month from mining crypto than I made all of last year. I trade it for USD, and I trade USD for things like water because water is worth more to me. 
Your argument is entirely flawed is so many ways. Who cares what nasa can coat their satellites with? Do they coat it with USD? Do they coat it with Political influence? Do they coat it with TV shows? No, but those things all have value in todays society. 
It's free money, I can't believe so many people aren't doing this. Anybody with a gaming PC can be making a killing if they spend a bit of time researching. 
Look, if you hate money that's fine, but don't get mad at us for taking the easy road.

I made about 20 grand so far this month. That's a killing to me. 


I'm a software dev, I get paid plenty for my real job. But making 20k a month for doing basically nothing but double clicking an icon is "making a killing" by my definition. If it isn't by yours that's fine. A point we disagree on, and one I don't care if we do. 


Yes you can. There are plenty of canadian exchanges dude. 
I'm going to stop responding to you. You're either a troll or simply ignorant. I hope you get over it in the future dude. Have a good life :)

I look forward to it, but I'll likely keep using litecoin for my online purchases.

Please explain to me why solar energy needs or benefits from a coin or blockchain?

A for effort. Final grade F though.

For starters bitcoin is already taking off. It's more of a global currency then pegged to a single nation. That and it's a limited supply, there will only ever be 21 million bitcoin. Because of this the value is expected to rise as time goes on. Sooner or later we'll be talking Satoshi (0.00000001 BTC, the minimum divisible unit of BTC) when looking at prices. 
That said bitcoin itself isn't suited as a currency. That's what other cryptos are for, we just don't know which one yet. BTC will be the gold/savings account. Something else will be the dollars/checking account.

BTC IS DEAD, IT CRASHED!

Yes you can.

Lightning network solves the transfer time problem, does it solve the fee problem as well?

There's always going to be more fake bullshit. Korean scare, more china scares, might be a USA ban scare. People panic. The market is manipulated. 
I do believe long term it will go up though, I guess that's why I'm here after all.
@_date: 2018-11-17 08:44:04
Just a guess, but it's likely because of how you worded your post. There are plenty of scaling options, just very few on chain and 0 that work perfectly today. 
@_date: 2018-11-17 08:41:39
The correlation changes though, and is declining. 
@_date: 2018-11-18 23:23:49
I'm confused, why would I pay $300 for this instead of using a pi or something? Is a lightning node too heavy for a pi?
@_date: 2018-11-17 08:49:18
It's worth just under 3 million. Probably 2 million by EoY. Where do you get $12 from?
@_date: 2018-11-17 08:45:28
If I ran a node I wouldn't buy a random $300 that I have no reason of trusting...
@_date: 2018-11-17 08:48:23
Can you backup your lightning node like you can backup your bitcoin keys? I know very little about lightning network.
@_date: 2018-11-17 08:44:35
Wait, I thought bitcoin was a store of value now? Not a currency...

The last thing we would want is a premature release. The fact that they go through so many revisions gives me nothing but confidence. It shows they're committed to a quality product.

It's not bad now, but it was recently.

This is why I don't go to the States anymore. Last time we went my girlfriend got hassled for like 2 hours.
