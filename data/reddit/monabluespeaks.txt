This is a big deal actually. Reading through this guys timeline. He knows!

This was great... amazing to see the humble beginnings.

I read a few months ago that we found a hidden tribe in the Amazon via drone that had never been discovered before. Not that we should interfere and mess with them but it's interesting to note that an entire tribe had never been documented before. Makes you wonder what else we haven't seen on our own planet.

That's why it's called exploring, though. Exploring the other continents was scary prior to having it mapped out. 
@_date: 2018-09-16 16:15:02
It's not about safety per se. All exploration was dangerous at one point.

Very good

What do you mean by much?

Well.. In his mind he isn't dealing with stocks. There's no point in diversifying if you consider BTC to essentially be currency. Nobody goes out of their way to hold USD and Euros, for instance.

Impressive. How long did this take you?
@_date: 2017-10-24 14:51:14
Just a guy with ideas. Yeah. Just like all them other used car salesmen doing big things. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 15:04:43
What are you even talking about 
@_date: 2018-03-14 01:00:34
This seems pretty sweet -

Daaaamn.

It’s by design
@_date: 2019-09-26 21:16:12
Long as you don’t get caught up
@_date: 2018-04-03 14:46:04
He’s truly a sociopath. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 15:06:12
What does that mean?
@_date: 2017-05-25 21:04:25
Nothing crazy - Had 1 BTC about 2.5 years ago. Sold it for something like $300 because I needed to pay some bills. 
@_date: 2017-07-24 14:39:19
What’s so special about it? 
@_date: 2017-05-25 15:26:10
Gemini doesn't work in my state :(
@_date: 2018-12-31 01:58:25
You don’t think he poses and interesting case for the real world utilization of bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-12-31 01:57:55
You don’t think insecure people matter?
@_date: 2018-12-31 01:59:00
Remember what happened when PayPal tried to block payments to Wikileaks? How’d that go?
@_date: 2018-12-31 14:03:05
Wow, shameful
