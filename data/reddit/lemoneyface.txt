edit: pls ignore, misunderstood OP
~~The trade halting makes perfect sense actually from the Havelock's POV.~~
~~If a company listed on your exchange is engaging in suspicious trading activities, you'd have a moral &amp; legal obligation to halt them. The onus of proof would be on the company to provide the necessary explanations.~~
~~If authorities do deem the suspicious activities to be illegal after investigation and if Havelock didn't halt the trading, Havelock would be complicit in this fraud as they failed their fiduciary duties.~~

I'm curious as to how the commercials managed to convince you to reach that conclusion. They explained nothing to the viewers on what the business does or what bitcoins are.
