For buying and selling I recommend Circle or Coinbase, in that order. But don't hold coin at a bitcoin "bank". Copay is easy to use and runs on anything. And it runs the same on all of them. For more advanced options, consider something else. If you're on Android, go Mycelium. If you're on iOS, go Breadwallet. If you're on desktop, go Electrum.

Locking the device up is fine. Connect it to Mycelium so you can deposit without the device. Only take it out to withdraw. Put the seed in a password wallet just in case. Don't overcomplicate things. It introduces human error into the equation.

Uh, that's a pretty hefty accusation. You realize you're accusing arguably the best in the business of theft? You might want to bring more to the table than speculation because there is much more evidence in favor of Mycelium. They have a vested business interest in keeping Bitcoin safe than your particular investment would cover.


Then you didn't use BitAddress.org the way you're instructed to, opening your transaction to sniffing, malware, and everything else the internet has to offer. It's more likely that malware on your computer was involved. In the future, use it [correctly](

So he's not real? BUT WHO WAS PHONE?!
@_date: 2016-04-12 05:40:55
That's a Money Services Business. You'll probably have to get a license through the Banking Commission of your state and every state in which you want to do business. Not to mention insurance and such.
@_date: 2016-04-02 00:22:03
You could buy from local providers. But in many states, mine for example, they are required to have money business licenses themselves and are supposed to follow the same AML/KYC laws that Coinbase, Circle, and Uphold do. If you find one that doesn't, they're possibly operating illegally. If they get caught, so could you. Do what you like, I guess.
I'm not doing anything illegally either, so I understand what you're upset about. I'm pointing out that it's not Coinbase that is the problem here. What are they supposed to do? Tell the government of the nation in which they choose to do business to piss off? That's just going to get them put out of business. They can either choose to comply with the law and hope the masses of people that they sell bitcoin to decide to take a stand and get it changed or give up doing business.
That's not the whole premise of the money. Sure, it was a feature. It still can be. Hell, it still is in most parts of the world that Bitcoin is used. But you and everyone else in this country need to do your part to get the law changed, not go online to bag on a company for following the law. They're in the business of making money, not starting a financial revolution or making a stand against the powers that be. Not everyone is an idealist.
Everyone should be forced out? Who are you to make choices for the rest of us, the Bitcoin CEO? Decentralization indeed. Again, not everyone is an idealist.

How much Bitcoin did you buy for $100? That's the important number. Look at the email you were sent. Look at the details of the sale in Coinbase. What was the date? How much BTC was it? How much was paid in fees? Do you still have the same amount in your account?

False. It means nothing. The assumption is that they could move at any time and is factored into the price already. Do you think any professional investor doesn't anticipate that the satoshi coins are going to eventually move? Without proof, the assumption is that they are still valid.

All the big name players in the US are having to do it. Circle, Coinbase, Uphold, etc. You could see if there's a LibertyX location near you. I hear if you stay under $200 per day you can avoid having to give out your info. Well, at least until they get cracked down on. You could go with Local Bitcoins, Paxful, or Mycelium Local Trader as well, but they're supposed to be following the same guidelines if they're in the US. It just depends on the person you're dealing with, I guess.
@_date: 2016-04-08 23:03:51
You've still not provided any proof that BitAddress.org is insecure. You've only pointed out that HD wallets are better for repeat use. I conceded that point because it's true. But for one time, long term, offline storage, meant to be swept when needed, is perfectly acceptable. And the fact that OP asked about that specifically, my advice was not bad.

Yes, but you're going to pay well above market price. You're going to do so because you're asking a seller to trust you. You're asking them to send you a commodity that can't be charged back and you're paying them with an unverified account on a service that will take the money you paid with back from the seller just by you sending them an email. Why would anyone trust you? The risk is high, so the fee will be high.

Go ahead, fight the good fight. I applaud you. Know you're not alone. I've called my Congressmen and Senators. I've talked to local leaders about it. I've talked to state regulators about it.

The transaction you just made is at the end of the blockchain. Your copy of the blockchain is currently somewhere in the middle. The coin aren't showing because your blockchain isn't complete. Check the address you sent them to at a [blockchain explorer site](

You're looking at full node software. It has wallet features but also contains all the transactions ever made, meaning a complete copy of the blockchain. If all you want is a wallet, try Copay or Electrum. Better yet, use your mobile and get Copay, Mycelium, or Breadwallet.

@_date: 2016-04-12 03:48:35
If you're new, I always send people to my website, [Incorporating Bitcoin]( to get them started. But to answer your question more directly, I would say that you can look for a LibertyX location near you. If none are nearby, take a look at Local Bitcoins or Paxful to see if anyone near you will accept it. None of the big name sellers are going to accept it because the US and Canada governments, especially the US, think it's too easy to launder money buy buying prepaid cards and then turning them into an pseudo anonymous cryptocurrency. They've pretty much put the clamps on that.

@_date: 2016-04-02 15:24:58
Tap on the $100. Does it switch to BTC? If so, Circle was just showing you how much your Bitcoin was worth in your local currency. If not, go to the menu, to settings, and look at currency. Does it say Bitcoin? If not, click there and switch it. Circle allows you to store in your local currency to avoid fluctuation, but what good is that? You might miss the moon!
@_date: 2016-04-09 23:40:23
Go to your Settings section. If the "Currency" is Bitcoin, you have bitcoin. You bought bitcoin when you deposited money into Circle. If that currency section says US Dollars or British Pound you have those things. But if you were to transfer money somewhere it would go there using Bitcoin because Circle's whole backend runs on Bitcoin.
So, when your 3-5 day wait period for them to set up your account is up, you can send bitcoin to whatever address you please. But, just a fair warning, Circle can track your stuff, so you may not want to do anything illegal with it. Not saying you would... Just giving advice.

Agreed. I don't believe I've had a single complaint about Coinbase. I do wish they had the same instant and fee level as Circle, but it's a business and they're allowed to charge what they want. I continue to use both and will continue to do so.
@_date: 2016-04-01 03:40:04
Which wallet are you using, then?
@_date: 2016-04-25 18:55:11
Circle. Hands down.
@_date: 2016-04-01 14:19:05
You're absolutely right on that point. I'm sure it sucks. But, again, all your troubles here are due to the arbitrary limits imposed by an outdated banking system, misconceptions about how transactions work, and your impatience.
ACH and debit card transactions take time. They appear instant to you because your bank and Visa/MasterCard have agreements in place to allow money to flow in the promise of payment. All the money goes into a virtual pile and then it's sorted and distributed. This can take up to a month to settle. It can also be reversed several months down the road.
Enter Bitcoin. You're using a system to trade that old money for new money. The new money makes all those old piles go away, as well as transaction times and reversibility. The conversion system you're using doesn't want to hand you the new money before the old money you traded for it settles because you could just call your bank and have the transaction stopped or reversed. So you have to wait, which takes patience.
Now, once you have the new money you are free to transact without that pesky old money system getting in the way. It'll be much faster, irreversible, and have no arbitrary limits... until you go to turn it back into old money. Then you're going to have to deal with the old money system and limits again.
Does that make sense?
@_date: 2016-04-01 14:27:16
How would it stop robberies? Pipe wrench decryption works just fine. Tumblers and conversion are a viable option to launder.

* 1. I generally recommend using the same software that created the passphrase to recover. If you hear that a wallet is discontinuing development, it'd probably be a good idea just to switch anyway.
* 2. Your wallet is stored on your phone. Your bitcoin are not. Your wallet is a collection of addresses and keys. That's all that's in there. Your bitcoin and the transactions involved are all stored on the blockchain forever. Your wallet just pulls that information from the blockchain using the addresses and keys in your wallet.
* 3. Your wallet is stored on your device. Your recovery key is what is known as a seed. It doesn't have to change.
* 4. Yes, it is possible. You can do this using a web wallet, but I don't recommend storing that way. You could do it by installing the same wallet software on another device and using the recovery key.
* 5. I wait around for verifications if I'm worried about the money, but if you pay the fee recommended by your wallet it should go through pretty quick.

Hello Anna. I'm the founder of [Incorporating Bitcoin]( a website dedicated to helping be users understand Bitcoin. I'd be happy to help. To answer your first two questions:
* To me, the hardest parts are that usage is not very widespread, regulations aren't consistent, and taxes, at least in the US, are a pain.
* It's not ready to be the global reserve currency. It's still in its infancy.
@_date: 2016-04-25 05:08:00
I'm not denying that. I'm just saying that they're not just cutting US users off. They're going to keep servicing the loans, collecting payments, and allowing US users to get paid. They're just not allowing any future business, which is probably why the number of loans has decreased dramatically.
@_date: 2016-04-19 17:37:07
I'm one that buys a little on a regular basis. I started out spending what I would have spend in cigarettes. Been quit over three years now. Did the same thing when I decided to quit drinking. Added that money into my regular purchases. Now I just get part of my paycheck in bitcoin through Bitwage.
@_date: 2016-04-01 16:50:21
Good luck. Anywhere in the US is not going to go for this because of AML/KYC. Too easy to launder money.
@_date: 2016-04-19 06:07:06


Sure, if you follow the rest of the guideline.
@_date: 2016-04-25 05:18:26
Doesn't mean we have to like it, though. I'm bummed they went that direction. I really liked their service. Oh well, I've since moved to Loanbase. They've had their problems, but it's working ok for me. Bitbond is good, too.
@_date: 2016-04-12 02:36:41
You sent Bitcoin from the blockchain wallet. You sent it to an address created by a different wallet, I assume. So which wallet software did you use? Another blockchain wallet or something else?
@_date: 2016-04-12 14:09:39
I prefer Mycelium on my phone and hardware wallets by Ledger. I describe using both at my website: [Incorporating Bitcoin](
@_date: 2016-04-14 02:29:03
That short answer is yes.
The long answer is going to be that your prepaid card is the problem. None of the big names accept them because they make it too easy to launder money. You could try LibertyX, Local Bitcoins, or Paxful. When they ask where you want it sent you give them whatever address you want, even if that's directly to Backpage.
However, it's probably safer to send them to a wallet you control. If there's a hiccup you at least have done recourse. If you control no part of it, you're screwed.
@_date: 2016-04-12 18:33:15
Nope. Transactions are irreversible. I sincerely hope you didn't lose too much.

CPU/GPU mining is over. ASIC Mining as an individual is only viable in certain situations. It's moved to the realm of large scale mining corporations.

That's not how paper wallets work. You make them, you print them, you send bitcoin to the address on them, you store them securely. When you want your funds to become accessible again, you sweep them. Read these two tutorials on my site for [making]( and [using]( paper wallets.
@_date: 2016-04-24 19:47:49
@_date: 2016-04-02 15:32:20
Mining would need to become profitable in those places again. This means power would need to become cheaper, hardware would need to become more readily available and efficient, and the price of Bitcoin would need to go up.
@_date: 2016-04-14 19:46:08
You're probably going to have to verify eventually, but I've heard rumor limits are based on repeated successful transactions.

Personally, I'd go with Circle. And I've reviewed several options at [my website](
@_date: 2016-04-15 15:15:39
Certainly not any more than cash does. Compare fiat cash, especially that issued by the US, versus Bitcoin confiscated in criminal and terrorist activities over the past seven years or so that Bitcoin had been around. Implying that Bitcoin is bad because it's used by criminals and terrorists is a seriously fucking stupid argument. I don't have a more polite way of saying it. 
@_date: 2016-04-22 22:37:14
At 15 the big sellers are going to require  ~~excited~~ explicit permission from your parents, but you may be able to find a seller on Local Bitcoins or Paxful.
Edit: autocorrect correct
@_date: 2016-04-22 05:59:21
I like the technical capabilities of Mycelium. I like the added features of Airbitz. I like the simplicity of Copay. I like buying and selling on Circle. I like the Shift card add-on of Coinbase. I use them all.
@_date: 2016-04-24 00:25:57
Exactly. I bought cheap parts and fired one up, but nearly any old computer can do the job. Price is minimal.
@_date: 2016-04-18 00:42:01
You can, but I'd recommend getting a hardware wallet instead. They're fairly cheap and reusable.
@_date: 2016-04-17 03:47:51
I still say buy and move. If you happen to send somewhere Coinbase doesn't like, they shut people down. I haven't heard of Circle, whom I prefer, doing that but I wouldn't risk it.
@_date: 2016-04-22 05:57:37
Personally, I would punch those 45 random characters into [Bitcoin Paper Wallet on Android]( and see if it recognizes them. It uses a few different types of Private Key formats. Do you have access to an Android phone? If not, you could install [Bluestacks]( on a Windows machine.
@_date: 2016-04-05 18:57:04
@_date: 2016-04-13 04:57:43
It is for you. They've been going through and tagging users because of Anti-Money Laundering laws they're forced to follow. They're making them register because of the Know Your Customer guidelines. If you don't want to do it, get your Bitcoin out to a wallet you control and never go back to Circle. If you want to continue to use their service, do what they ask or they'll shut down your account.
@_date: 2016-04-11 22:23:18
Import puts the private key from the paper wallet into your wallet software adding the address to your wallet software so you can access the funds. Sweep uses the private key to send the funds from the paper wallet to an address generated by your wallet software. Sweep is more secure.

Do you drug test your hundreds to see if they have coke on them?
@_date: 2016-04-17 03:34:55
Well, they're not technically a bank, but they act like one. You open an account with them and they provide you a wallet. You buy and sell bitcoin and they put it in that wallet. But you don't control that wallet, they do. Just like a bank, you have a so called legal right to what's in your account, but realistically they can just lock you out if they want to. I'm not saying they will, but they can. Don't get me wrong, I love Circle and Coinbase, but I primarily use them to buy and sell bitcoin. I do have an open wallet at Coinbase, but only to attach my Shift Payments debit card to it. Otherwise, I do all my own holding, saving, spending, receiving, etc, using a wallet I control.
Look, I know it's a lot to understand. We've all been where you are now. But don't get overwhelmed and don't give up. I wrote a whole webpage to explain most of this stuff to people. You can check it out if you're still confused: [Incorporating Bitcoin]( Feel free to ask any questions you want through Reddit or through the contact page on my site. I'll answer as best I can and get back to you as soon as I have a chance.

You're welcome. I'm glad they're working for you. Let me know if you need help.
@_date: 2016-04-02 15:55:27
Most wallet providers do it for free. Some have related side projects that pay. Copay is from Bitpay. Mycelium has their hardware ventures like Entropy and Card. Breadwallet, I'm guessing, was just put out by an iPhone enthusiast that wanted a Bitcoin wallet at a time where Apple was being a bunch of haters. Thus free.
@_date: 2016-04-08 17:44:31
That address is yours and good as long as you keep your Circle account.
@_date: 2016-04-04 00:46:24
Copay runs on anything. Try that one.
@_date: 2016-04-26 02:46:04
Visa. Seriously, if they decided that the Shift card was a successful test and decided to throw their lot in...

Maybe if you live above the Arctic Circle.
@_date: 2016-04-02 05:54:06
See, that's what I'm talking about. I have a phone right here that accepts text messages. I could do this for you. But you don't want to tell me what it's for, who it's coming from, or any details at all. It could be nuclear codes from some terrorist group or some government emails tied to Hillary Clinton. Or it could be something completely harmless. But you won't divulge that in a public setting, which makes it seem shady. So why would I risk being tied to something potentially illegal for $5? It's got to be something you don't want to be tied to or you'd have a bloody burner phone, wouldn't you?
But, hey, I'll just fuck off in the most kindly manner I can. Good luck.

Bitpay does not process USD payments. They process Bitcoin payments and will pay out in USD. That's not what OP asked for.
@_date: 2016-04-18 16:50:19
The person doing it as a business, meaning the person advertising the service on Local Bitcoins, is definitely culpable. The other person, maybe, depending on if the prosecutor wants to be a hardass. Sometimes they like to make an example that ignorance of the law does not excuse transgression.

If your account is already set up and your bank account already connected, Circle is the best. If not and you need them today, look for a LibertyX location or a Local Bitcoins seller.
@_date: 2016-04-17 17:04:55
This was your first transaction, right? This happened to someone else last week. Contact their support. It's possible that something didn't approve right or your bank is holding it up or something.

Welcome to Anti-Money Laundering laws and Know Your Customer guidelines, also known as AML/KYC regulations.

I used BTCJam for the past several months. I even wrote a review about it for my website. It was the best of the loan sites, in my opinion. Then they passed down this ruling that they would no longer offer loans or investment opportunities to US citizens. I'm not really sure where it came from, but it's their choice to do so.
They have stated that US borrowers will still need to pay off their loans. US investors will still have access to the site. The loans they've invested in will still be serviced, and they will be able to withdraw their funds once the loans they are invested in receive payments. I still receive payments and i withdraw in batches. The only thing that has changed here is that US investors can no longer invest.
That being said, if you have funds invested be sure to log in on a regular basis and pull your funds out. No telling when they'll just shut down access to US users to snuff the bullshit.
@_date: 2016-04-23 00:30:08
The only one I would remotely trust would be Coinbase Vault. It's multi-sig, at least. But if still rather trust a solution I control.

There are currently no payment processors that take USD and pay out in BTC. You can display prices in USD, but if you're accepting BTC they will have to pay you in BTC. You could recommend Circle to them as a Bitcoin wallet. They have USD accounts that transmit BTC, but they'll still need to deposit USD to get in first.
@_date: 2016-04-17 00:54:12
Nope. Buy there. Sell there. Do not hold there. Move your funds to a wallet you control before doing anything with them.
@_date: 2016-04-09 18:46:13
Yes. Why?
@_date: 2016-04-16 00:20:14
Mining, no. But that's because everyone sees the "gold rush" days and hours for free money. That's the secret: Bitcoin = Money. Bitcoin is worth it for the sake of Bitcoin. But instead of Mining it we now earn it. For a more in depth answer, read up on the stuff I post at [my site]( I explain it better there.
@_date: 2016-04-22 05:52:11
If it's not worthless now, having 21 million in play won't make it worthless either. That being said, the last of the bitcoin won't be mined until sometime around 2140, so I think we've got some time to figure it out.
Now, before you get flamed too hard, check out the FAQ over in the sidebar or take some time to read up on my site, [Incorporating Bitcoin](

Use Circle. Next time, transfer to a wallet you control first, like Mycelium, Copay, or Breadwallet. Do your business. Buy more through Circle. Rinse, repeat.
@_date: 2016-04-09 18:41:49
If you look in the settings where it says Currency you should see though currency you're working with. If it says US Dollars it's that. If it says Bitcoin it's that. When you deposit money it's covered to whichever currency your Circle account uses. If someone were to send you Pounds it would be converted to whichever currency your Circle account uses. Just make sure it says Bitcoin.

So don't hold your money there. I never suggested that. Buy it and move it.
@_date: 2016-04-13 18:05:37
That's where I ask if they understand how currency is currently created. The statement, "You do realize that money is made up by lending companies at will, right?" usually opens that door. People still believe banks use strict, deposit based, fractional reserve with limits.

The fact that you hate Ver so much that you can't admit that the interviewer was acting like a child is very telling. Ver repeatedly asked him to call the project by the proper name that it chose. Not only did the interviewer refuse, he went into a repeat loop to egg Ver on. That is both childlike and rude coming from a person requesting an interview. It's basic manners, but I should expect nothing more from a mentally deficient child.

If you think he was reasonable, I'm sure you're a joy at parties. Asking for someone's time and then acting like that is just plain rude. You're wrong and uncouth.
And, since I need to clarify, I was not appealing to authority. I was noting a clear difference between an account with substance and varied history versus an account with nothing of substance outside of comments akin to shilling. Again, you're wrong. Deal with it.

Welcome to the world of ACH. Coinbase initiated the transfer. It's in the system, the clearing house. It'll get to your bank in a few days. Then they'll verify and put it in your account. Again, the problem is not Bitcoin, it's an artificially slow banking system.
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:27:42
I'm also tired of the stupid name war and the incessant whining in both subs. trying to pin a name they know is wrong onto Bitcoin Cash is childish. Oddly enough, using Bitcoin Core is more grown up because they're simply trying to differentiate for clarity purposes. However, they lose the high ground with every attempt to rename it Segwit Coin, Bitcoin Segwit, or something like that. In order to alleviate my desire to unsubscribe from both threads I've started assuming that anyone playing the name game is a paid shill or a mentally deficient child.

Because that's where the buy and sell orders on GDAX position it. Once liquidity increases and trading actually starts it'll balance out with the other exchanges.

Cross examination...
1. They did it this way because they said they would.  Your belief  is true. It's not, but I'll get to that.
2. Because the price was based on the orders placed on GDAX. No other exchange prices were considered because no other exchange bases their prices on other markets.
3. Because possession with no ability to sell is what you're bitching about in  Which one do you want?
4. They mentioned it repeatedly in their blog. They said several times that it was coming some time in or before January. It's the end of December. Seems on time with all of their statements.
5. How dumb are you for not checking your sources and listening to the echo chamber?
Edit: downvotes with no rebuttals. Damn you folks are some salty snowflakes.

I didn't say you couldn't. I said you can't buy or sell Bitcoin **legally in my state** without a license. Just because you can do something doesn't make it legal. According to the Banking Commission in my state the buying and selling of cryptocurrency for fiat or the reverse is considered currency exchange. And currency exchange makes you a Money Services Business. Being a Money Services Business requires a license. Another thing that could require a license is transmitting currency through a settlement layer, which is what the Lightning Network is. It's storing currency, collecting data about transactions, and then settling batches of transactions. Again, you **can** do it, but doing it without a license could land you in jail.

Ver repeatedly asked him to call the project by the proper name that was chosen by the project. Not only did the interviewer refuse, he went into a repeat loop calling it "bcash" to egg Ver on. Half the "interview" was the interviewer refusing to call the project by it's proper name. The other half was accusations with no evidence to back it up. That is both childlike and rude coming from a person requesting an interview. This is not fundamentally biased. I don't give a shit who he was interviewing, this was amateur and pathetic.

"Seems wrong" doesn't mean shit when it comes to FinCEN and the banking cartels. I was told by the banking commission in my state that even buying and selling to friends and family would require me to have a license and follow AML/KYC.

1. I will echo what someone else said: who cares what they think? When new tech comes out, most people get dragged into it. Everything from cars to credit/debit cards on up to email were initially resisted by the mainstream. They were either too strange, too difficult, too expensive, etc. Adoption will come when the tech and the people are ready.
2. The short answer is that you don't know that and can't know that. The long answer is to do your homework. Either you don't know what a Ponzi scheme is or you don't know how Bitcoin works. There is no central figure. There is no top to the pyramid. People cry Ponzi because they feel early adopters are unfairly favored with rewards. Venture capital always favors early adopters. This is always the case in any new technology. Get on board or get over it.
3. By all means, stick to cash if it works for you. I really don't see Bitcoin replacing cash in my lifetime. Bitcoin works for those of us wanting online cash and wanting to use electronic cash face to face. If you don't spend online or have friends that use Bitcoin, maybe it's no good to you.
4. Why does this always come up? I hate this question. If you're a prepper, no answer will satisfy you. You're crazy and made up your mind already. If you're not a prepper, who gives a shit? If Armageddon comes, the ones left will be worried about who is trying to eat them, not how they are going to pay for a latte. Drop the delusion or start prepping.
5. Again, it may not be a better option for you. If you can't use it anywhere, even between friends, and you're not interested in investing in it early, why would you bother? But, again, it's something useful to some of us. And, again, I think adoption will come when the tech and the people are ready for it.
So, I'm going to invest, I'm going to use it online and with my friends, and I'm going to watch as the world slowly, grudgingly, adopts another technology it didn't realize it wanted at first glance. And, when it does, I will, again, sit back and chuckle.
...or I'll be wrong and burn all my worthless paper wallets as I cry into my campfire waiting for someone to try and eat me.

That is complete bullshit. You absolutely cannot compare the two, even on a scale. A company like Overstock accepting Bitcoin is big news and it generated sales for two reasons: Everyone had heard of Overstock and they sell everything.
On the other hand, I've never heard of Betabrand, so their reach must be smaller. I did not hear they began accepting Bitcoin, so their announcement wasn't big news. I have no idea what they sell, so I probably would not have spent my Bitcoin there. Not even remotely comparable.

On that point, I will agree with you. They could have communicated the change better and tried to contact the owners better. I will not argue that.

@_date: 2014-02-26 05:41:33
I know the feelings on GOX and their current status. But, for sake of argument, let's take a look at the other possibility. Let's agree to assume for the moment that GOX either has the coin frozen or that someone agreed to bail them out. Either is very possible at this point because no official announcements on the status of the coin have been verified. The Karpeles chat says they aren't lost, just inaccessible. All signs point to GOX rebranding and attempting to make good. The people buying on BB are banking on that. And if they are right, even two years down the road, they just raked in a ton of coin for next to nothing.
But between you and me, I think it's all smoke and those guys are nuts.

Bitcoin is a group. Everyone running a Bitcoin node has a say in what gets put in Bitcoin. If a feature is proposed and less than half of bitcoiners like it, they don't upgrade. You can't force features nobody wants on the protocol.

Lost coins? No. As I'm fond of saying, $100 bills seem lost to circulation until someone takes them out of their storage shed to launder through a car wash. No movement could be long term cold storage.

It's not just your bank. All banks have to Flag deposits over a certain amount and report them. It's anti money laundering rules they have to follow. If you have a bank in the know you could provide paperwork from Coinbase to show that the money is profits from investment and you should be fine.
Tell them that you are interested in Bitcoin as an investment and lay out your concerns for account closure. See how they react. If they are hostile, stop using that account for Bitcoin and start a new account elsewhere. Find a bank that is educated and friendly to Bitcoin. Credit Unions are usually good about it.

A Ponzi scheme, by definition, pays guaranteed dividends to earlier investors from capital paid in by later investors. This is not the case with Bitcoin. There are no guaranteed returns. Earlier investors are not paid dividends from capital paid in by later investors. By definition, Bitcoin can not be a Ponzi scheme. If you want to call it a scam, fine. But get your scams right. Investment, securities, or stock fraud using boiler room tactics, would be a possible choice. You look like an ignoramus repeating this false accusation.

Seriously, I'm done talking to you until you learn what is meant by centralization and decentralization. All of your arguments hinge on this and fail. The tech you're referencing are emerging to counter spying by governments, allow free market trade without oversight, or to prevent the possibility of shutting down connection *to* the internet in areas of unrest. They aren't decentralizing the internet. They may be preventing attempts to centralize it or make it more difficult. I'll grant you that. But the fact remains that decisions made in the US will have no effect on servers and connections run in Sweden, for example. Their internet experience will not change because **the internet does not have a central authority that makes decisions about how the whole system runs.** So stop talking. I'm tired of your childish attempts to insult me and arguing with you.

This is the worst argument I think I've ever read on Bitcoin.
Even if Bitcoin is a get rich quick scheme, it's open to everyone at this point, regardless of price. Investing, even at the smallest amount, leads to proportional rewards at that level. So, yes, it is true that someone buying in with a currency that isn't as strong as the dollar won't see rewards at that level, but local to their area, the rewards would be proportional.
Netbooks would run a browser. Linux runs on them fine. Pirated Windows usually runs free or pirated security software. Even old smart phones run a browser. Paper wallets are available for security. Pencil and paper works great in any setting. The technological issues can be gotten around.
The biggest hurdles would be internet access and language. If I learned all about it in my free time using nothing but the internet, so can someone else.
Seriously, these crusades and guilt trips are bullshit.

Look, as an American, I hate the idea of what that is going to do to the internet if it passes, but it's not going to affect people outside the US visiting sites hosted outside the US. Do you know why? Because the internet is not solely American. It is not a hegemony with a central authority that can place those rules on the whole internet. Again, your argument fails.

The condescending attitude is not helping your case. Now, let's resume like adults, shall we?
These articles aren't describing a centralized internet. They are describing services on the internet that have been compromised by the US government under the guise of protecting people from terrorists. A centralized internet would mean you have to use these services or not be allowed on the internet. You don't.
You have every right to build your own email server, storage server accessible from anywhere, and VPN/SSH to connect to them, etc. and connect it to the internet without permission from anyone. These services are not dependent on the inclusion of your friends, so they could be solely used effectively on your own. You have complete control over the software, should you choose to use open source. You can then know that backdoors do not exist because you can read the source. They cannot coopt a protocol or the internet would break.
You know why there are less providers? Because people don't like to run them on a small scale. Don't like the shortage of service providers? You can buy a backbone line and start your own. Sure, it'll take some startup capital, but imagine the rake if you promised secure data with no tracking as long as it's on your network? They'll be walled inside your network, but we all make sacrfices. Anyway, hire some people to help you run it and away you go. It's completely legal, because the internet has no central authority. You may get a call from the NSA, but that's an American problem not an internet one.
Social media? That's a choice. I'm not on Myspace, Facebook, Orkut... I'm on G+, but I don't Instagram my lunch, nor do I Tweet. Again, that's not an example of a central authority. That's users flocking to a service they like. Make something better and don't let the NSA have a backdoor. Again, that's an American problem not an internet one.
Prime example: if the internet had a central authority, there would be no pirate bay. Big money would have shut it down. Service providers would block access to it. Their service would not work. Truth is that it's still there and accessible, even from a country that hates it.
And your Microsoft anecdote is a bad example. Again, that's putting things in a central location, not being under a central authority.
Your move.

This can be handled by theft and fraud laws currently in place. I feel bad for the people that lost. I really do. But the point is that they put themselves in this situation. Whether through greed, gambling, or ignorance, they had more tied up in GOX than they could afford to lose. This is basic investing knowledge. You don't put all your eggs in one basket. If you carry all your cash around in one single sack and someone steals your sack, nobody cries bailout. If you give someone your sack and they run off with it, nobody tries to regulate your sack. They shrug their shoulders and tell you that you should have known better. Why should Bitcoin be any different?

I purchase through Coinbase one or twice a week. I keep some in Coinbase as a web wallet. I keep more on my phone as a local wallet. I keep most of it in paper wallets in multiple locations. Getting it out of paper wallets to either my phone or Coinbase is easy. You have options on how to sell at that point.
I've honestly not sold any back to Coinbase so I can't say how easy that will be for you. Again, I really don't see them risking their reputation on small potatoes.

A couple weeks ago I went to make a payment on an art piece I'm buying for my wife. I had a gift card given to me as a bonus from work. The card was declined twice at the retailer. I told the retailer that I would return in a day or two with cash. When I got home I then swiped the gift card using my Square reader. The card was declined there as well. I checked online and, after some registration steps, I found that the balance was exactly what I was told it was. I was thoroughly confused, so I called their help line. Here is what they told me:
* 1. The merchant code of the retailer allowed for tipping. This causes all cards (credit, debit, or gift) to preauth for an extra 20%. Even though I did not want to tip at this retailer, I could not avoid that preauth.
* 2. The gift card merchant does not allow transactions through Square because they are a fraudulent company.
Had we all been using Bitcoin, we would not have had these issues.
**Edit:** fixed bullet points.

The confusing part is that, in fractional reserve, the money is lent out with interest to make a profit. This was stated in the article. Putting BTC in cold storage is simply putting funds it into another account. What makes it cold storage is that the account has never touched the internet.
First, it would be bad to give readers the impression that cold storage and funds therein could be used for investments. It might scare new users away from storing their funds securely if they thought someone could invest them. Second, the article could be interpreted to be implying that MtGOX was investing it's customers funds they had in cold storage. Although rumors have been heard, there is no hard evidence for this. To imply without evidence could be libel.
Instead, I would relate hot wallets to checking accounts and cold storage to savings accounts. The same principles talked about in the article apply. The need for a wait to move finds from savings to checking in order to disperse, especially. Another example would be paper wallets to stock certificates. You can transfer them between people like cash and the holder owns the funds contained therein.

False. It lets business people make shitty decisions knowing that there will be a group of people willing to give them money when they fuck up. Let the stakeholders in GOX dig deep in their own pockets and fix their own problems or fall on their own swords.
This decentralized currency is doing fine. There was a dip and it recovered by the end of the day. No central authority needed.

I'm not defending him, mind you. I'm saying that he's innocent until proven guilty. If you can pull the evidence together, make a case, and get a judge to convict, I'll add my voice to the list asking him to step down too.

My insults were not accusations. They were questions pertaining to your actions. You assert that you're responsible, yet don't bother to educate yourself at all. You saw an opportunity and jumped on it without bothering to do your homework. 
* 1. You didn't fully understand Bitcoin.
* 2. You didn't fully understand how to protect your account.
* 3. You didn't fully understand how to protect your Bitcoin.
* 4. You didn't fully understand Coinbase and it's limitations and risks.
* 5. After losing control twice, instead of figuring out what you could do to fix it, you continue to blame someone else for your shortcomings.
* 6. After all this you miss the literally dozens of stories posted in the last two days about how Mt. GOX is dead, a risk, and potentially insolvent.
I read your posts. All of them. Coinbase did good by you until you kept causing your own problems and expecting them to clean up your mess for you at their own expense. You need to stop, take responsibility for your actions, and do some fucking homework before you make a single further move. For the record, I never said you were a bad businessman. I said you doing like a petulant child. Ib stand by that, especially after reading your response to my post.

It's not completely wrong. My point is that, although the drop in value is real at this point, the loss isn't final until you sell and make it final. I have not lost because I haven't finalized the deal. I still have the same number of Bitcoin. If Bitcoin continues to drop then I can sell and cut my losses, sure. But then those losses will be finalized. But I don't believe the drop is an indicator of future performance. Because I did not invest more than I can afford to lose I can sit on the number of Bitcoin I have and wait it out. I am basing my decision on my belief that the market will rise again.
Clearly you're suggesting day trading tactics, which is great for you. But some of us are long term investors. It makes more sense to me to buy and hold, spend and replace, etc.

* Banks (Wells Fargo, Chase, BoA) and they've denied Bitcoin, one even going so far as to cancel accounts used to buy Bitcoin.
* Big oil (Exxon, Chevron, Phillips 66, Valero, Conoco, Marathon) and they don't care about Bitcoin. Seriously, not even a position statement out of the entire industry.
* Automotive (Ford, GM) and they are too busy being scared of Tesla, who will take Bitcoin.
* Tech (Apple, Verizon, Amazon, IBM, HP, Comcast, AT&amp;T) and they've either banned it, denied it, or ignored it.
* Healthcare/Insurance (Pfizer, UnitedHealth, Cardinal, MetLife, J&amp;J, P&amp;G, State Farm, WellPoint) and they don't care about Bitcoin. Seriously, not even a position statement out of the entire industry.
* Investment (AIG, Prudential) and their industry constantly puts out earnings against investing in Bitcoin.

Not to be contrary, but they only mention in their terms of service that they will do this. Yes, even mentioning Bitcoin is grounds to have your auction closed and even your account revoked. And it's not just Bitcoin. Is any payment system that isn't PayPal, credit cards through PayPal, etc. It is possible to set the auction up as pickup only and you can work out the payment with the buyer, but that does limit your audience.

I don't care none if you don't not like them. I'm not having this conversation with you so I can better my grammar.
But to answer your assertion, that reasoning sounds to me like either avoiding regulation, which I doubt, or wanting to avoid being publicly traded, which sounds more likely. If they want to avoid regulation on a regulated stock exchange with a publicly traded stock, I wish them luck. Playing in their arena means playing by their house rules. If they want to avoid being publicly traded, which is understandable, it'd have to be a premined coin, which means crypto people will view it as a pump and dump like Auroracoin or Mazacoin. In either case, it's possible, just not likely to work like they want.

@_date: 2014-05-26 15:13:04
You sound young. I say that because all of what I say here should be apparent to anyone that lived through the rise of credit cards.
Credit cards were once a strange technology that people had to convince businesses to accept. They were difficult to use and transact with. Businesses often shunned them because they didn't want to change to a new technology. Sound familiar? A bit like Bitcoin?
Credit cards used to be simply little slips of paper with numbers on them. A retailer would write down your little number and how much you owed them and report that back to the credit card company. The card company would issue money to the retailer and issue a bill to you. Credit card fraud ran rampant because, if you saw someone's little number you could write it down and use it anywhere that accepted that company's credit card. Sound familiar? A bit like an unencrypted private key?
Credit cards then evolved to be plastic, they came out with these little machines that would take an imprint of your card using carbon duplication paper. But if you didn't have your card with you you could always give them your number and they could write it down on the papers. So fraud changed to stealing the little carbon papers out of the trash and having a list of people's credit card numbers. The technology changed, so the method of fraud changed, and in the middle there was a time period where both methods worked.
Credit cards then included a magnetic stripe. But if your stripe wouldn't read or you forgot your card, you could have them manually punch in your number. Also, the machines that read the stripe were flaky. If the network they were connected to was down, businesses resorted to the little machines and pieces of paper they used to use. So, again, the technology changed, so the method of the fraud changed, and in the middle there was a time period where all those methods worked.
Credit cards then started putting a three digit code on the back, pictures of you on the front, physical billing address checks, security questions, and various other fraud preventing features. There are still backup methods. There are still ways around all of them. For instance, instead of dealing with a retailer, there was a time you could use credit cards online with just the account number and expiration date. Not to mention that everything is connected now, so a hacker in a one country can infiltrate a system in another country and steal lists of thousands of credit cards. So, again, even as the technology changes, the method of the fraud continues to change.
Bitcoin is new technology. There are people still learning and people that are out there taking advantage of people still learning. The tools that are available don't have built-in features to help protect those that aren't yet savvy. The services that are available don't either. And, yes, as you point out, there are scams aplenty. Unfortunately, Bitcoin needs to go through these scams to figure out how fraudsters do them so they can either people can become savvy and avoid them or the technology can change to include security features to protect people from them. There are still people out there that fall for the old Nigerian Prince routine.
In the example you seem so upset about, trusting a third party, many people don't have the option of a bank account connected to Coinbase to buy their BTC. Many rely on LocalBitcoins or Mycelium Local Trader. People expect to be able to spend their money using a debit card or PayPal and not have the transaction reversed because it wasn't something that often happened to your average user. It was mainly the average user using it to reverse a scam perpetrated by a fraudster. Because this is Bitcoin, banks and PayPal just reverse them at the slightest mention of scam by a buyer/seller. There are lots of people taking advantage of this. As for trusting exchanges, this appears to be mostly greed. I've talked to some people that lost money in the MtGox debacle. The ones that were smart investors, weren't greedy, and didn't have all their fiat and BTC wrapped up in MtGox were disappointed, but not crushed. And trusting a third party should not have to be an issue.
But trust in a third party should not be inherently bad. Remember that credit cards would never have worked without trusting multiple parties. The credit card company, the retailer, and the customer all had to agree to work together. If a business springs up to do a service, their livelihood is built around providing that service. An online wallet company that wants to remain an online wallet company has a very real interest in protecting their customers' online funds. Imagine a security company that runs armored trucks that simply drove off with trucks full of other people's money. They would not be in business very long and they would be hunted down by the law. This isn't because fiat is regulated. It's because it's a crime to steal. The issue we are seeing here is that this has now become an international issue with people investing across foreign borders.
The fact is that Bitcoin, being new technology, has a lot of growing up to do. I'm not saying it should be regulated, or that it should babysit people, but it certainly needs to become more friendly before your average consumer can use it without issues. I can't imagine my grandmother using Bitcoin, ever. She still goes through the express checkout at the store and writes an end-stub check for six dollars, slowly filling out both the check and the end-stub so she can manually balance her checkbook every month because it's what she knows, she's comfortable with it, and she doesn't want to change. I could see my parents using it, but it will have to become much easier to use and there will have to be some protections in place. My daughter, on the other hand, will probably laugh at my manual way of storing my BTC and the lengths I had to go to to protect it from thieves.

I don't care if he understands it or not. If his listeners believe him and don't get it, I don't care. You're assuming I want them to get it. I don't.

Let me begin by pointing out that he wasn't just buying and selling Bitcoin. He was transacting with customers. He states that it was customer complaints to Coinbase that prompted the freeze of his coin.
First offense would be not doing his homework. Bitcoin is new and there are flaws. He poured thousands of dollars into it without understanding it or how to protect it. Had he not wrapped up all his funds in that one account they would not have all been frozen. Had he known enough to run his own wallet and accounting system he could have moved it anywhere to sell it, even taking it to local Bitcoin dealers.
Second offense would be doing something bad enough that his customers contacted Coinbase on him. Do you really believe Coinbase freezes accounts for anything less than reports of an illegal nature, be it fraud or something on the same level? I'm not even suggesting he did anything, but he did upset someone enough that they reported him for it. Coinbase has terms you accept and they will protect themselves from their users as much as they will hackers. They aren't going to have their doors kicked in because one of they customers is another DPR running another Silk Road.
Third offense, because I consider it that important, would be being a repeat offender for not doing his homework. After all this he threatens to move all his funds to an exchange that had been in the news for a solid week as being dead, high risk, possibly insolvent. Seriously every third post on here for a week was about how bad GOX was. Yet he asks why people freak out when he suggests moving his funds out of one of the best Bitcoin brokers in the business to one of the worst Bitcoin exchanges.
Fourth offense would be thinking the worst instead of thinking rationally. He accuses Coinbase of defrauding him and taking advantage of him. Had he done his homework they could not have done so, but that's not even the point. Coinbase is a multimillion dollar business. This guys 20 BTC doesn't mean anything to them. They aren't going to risk their business defrauding this guy. They make far more than that in a day operating a legal business with thousands of happy customers.
Now, where I do agree with him is that Coinbase should have given him notice and allowed him to respond. I'm not saying they shouldn't have frozen his account. Had he known he was being investigated he could have transferred out the coin and been clear. Courts don't notify owners of assets being investigated before the freeze is in place either. But he should have been notified that it had happened and been able to respond to the complaints.

MtGOX was built by people and it failed therefore Bitcoin, also built by people, is bound to fail.
If people fail they are insured by the FDIC. If the FDIC fails it's backed by the government. He even uses the word bailout.

The internet runs on open source protocols. There are agreed upon rules. These are not controlled by any one entity. The servers, switches, routers, hubs, nodes, lines, connections, providers, are all run by different groups who agree to work together. This is the definition of decentralized. Those companies do not control the internet and if they choose not to play nice they will be excluded.
And their empires have crumbled. Do you pay for long distance? I don't. Do you pay for a copy of the Yellow Pages? Nope. It's free now, whether I want it or not. How about caller id? Voicemail? Call waiting? How much has your phone bill dropped in the last twenty years? Mine, except for my internet access, is now solely Federal access charges, taxes, and 911 service. Amazing, since all that used to cost me over $100 per month back in the day and the service was shitty.
**The internet showed that it could provide the same services, cheaper and more efficient, and the specialized, closed systems were forced to adapt.**
And it's not at all like your car example. Central banks have fought wars, spilled blood, extorted, murdered, over the right to control the money supply. All so they could run a system designed to impoverish people, to control. People didn't ask for banking services, they were forced to adapt to a system they were coerced into. This will change. I'm not suggesting it will go away, but it will change.
Scoff if you will, but the world has changed visibly in the past thirty years and those changes are coming faster every year. The old methods are dying.

No, it's quite indifferent really.

I gave your viewpoint a chance until your argument went to "shitfork". That attack is completely invalidated when I'm sitting here with three transactions in the more than 190K backlog that have 4% transaction fees on them and they won't go through in a timely fashion. I've been a Bitcoin fan and supporter since 2013 and typically a Bitcoin maximallist calling all other coins garbage. However, it's becoming increasingly difficult to defend that position. Why? Because if I can't use something, that's what I usually call a "piece of shit".

Seriously, you're looking at a huge difference in income, here. Major, actually. Let's forget those cards because they aren't out yet. Let's be realistic and do an example that is a best case scenario. Say you buy the equipment that is the best deal currently on the market (the best price per hash), in hand, and could be delivered tomorrow (used ASICMiner Cube for $300 on Amazon running at 38 gh/s). At that price point you could buy 66 of them (subject to availability). You'd still have to buy power supplies, racks, etc, but we'll skip all that for the sake of this argument.
We'll just say you get them tomorrow, set them all up and get them working. You get yourself hashing at a full 2508 gh/s or 2.5 th/s. They'll start bringing in coin rather fast, sure. To the tune of roughly 7.5 coins the first month. But then the difficulty bumps and you get roughly 4.5 coins the next month. Then it does it again and you get less than 3. And then again and it's less than 2. It's going to keep doing this over and over. By the end of the year you're pulling in less than 1 every month. You'll get roughly 20 coins by the end of the year. Again, that's if you start tomorrow and the difficulty raises at a steady rate.
Now, let's say you buy one of those cubes, use it to get the fascination out of your system, and spend the rest on coin. You have $19700 left over. If you spend that on coin directly you could have 35 coin in your wallet by the end of the week and whatever your miner brings in over time.
But wait, you say. The price will go up and I'll get rich. Hey, I'm a "to the moon guy" myself. I too believe it will go up. But would you rather have a possible 20 BTC over time while it goes up or a full guaranteed 35 BTC right now?
Trust me, I did my homework looking for any way I could to justify mining. I really had the itch and wanted it to work. I just couldn't do it. I have a little 7.6 gh/s rig churning out an alt coin right now and I put whatever money I can afford to lose into Coinbase buying the scraps I can get my hands on. I wish I had your $20K so I could buy those 35 BTC.

I'm no detective. My guess is that they used reserves to pay people as a smoke screen in hopes to buy time long enough to earn enough profits to get back on track. They used the transaction malleability excuse as another one. But the leaked crisis document blew the situation wide open causing more panic, which caused potential investors to distance themselves. With no hope for an injection of capital, meaning bailout, they sunk, taking everything with them. Basically, we are seeing the Bitcoin Titanic in action. Again, this is just a guess. I'm no detective.

I'll be honest, at this point I'm hodling. I'm doing so for two reasons. First, all my BTC are worth less than what I paid for them. I came in on the downhill side of the GOX bubble pop. Second, they're like a savings account for me right now. I'm putting in money as I can, which is about $50 per week. But, if/when BTC goes up again, I will have no problem paying for things with them. It's just that my incentive at this point is to save.

The difference there is the way in which these things are presented. This graph was presented showing data and posing the question how Bitcoin will fit in. This is acceptable. The bubble picture is a depiction of a pattern, not actual data, and it's presented in two ways: from the perspective of the scared noob or the smug troll/disbeliever. These are not acceptable.
Bitcoin has bubbles. Bubbles were predicted in the very early days if Bitcoin. The calm, rational, educated believers know there are bubbles, have seen bubbles, and expect more bubbles. Bubbles rise and bubbles pop. There are bubbles for anything in any market. This position is acceptable. The scared noob has not done their homework on this and thus is full of fear. The smug troll/disbeliever claims that Bitcoin as a whole is one giant bubble and thus causes fear. These positions are not.

After all the shit Apple has done over the past 20 years, I absolutely refuse to believe they have done anything, absolutely anything, that wasn't driven by greed, the need to destroy competition, or desire for control. And if they want to change my opinion and the opinion of those like me, they need to start providing some fucking transparency on their decisions. Because right now they all look really suspicious.
They could have simply put out a press release stating that there were some flaws in their OS that made it an unsafe environment for Bitcoin wallets. They could have explained those flaws, had their own team patch the holes in the OS, and helped developers resolve the problems in their software. Instead, they yank Bitcoin software from the App Store, but only the apps that allowed mobile payments, amid rumors that they are developing their own mobile payment system. Then they provide reasons that are absolute bullshit, like policy. But if it's policy, why are PayPal, Square, Dwolla, etc still on the App Store? Because those companies are big name players. Taking any one of them out of the App Store would cause a PR shitstorm. Apple would lose a major cut of business overnight.
You mark my words: Bitcoin mobile wallets will be back on iOS and in the App Store. But it won't happen until the big money players in Bitcoin are able to put pressure on Apple. And my guess is that, by then, it'll be too late for Apple.

She wrote a very good explanation on all this. I'd caution against mentioning cold storage/hot wallet and fractional reserve to close together, though.

Having a self-governing body that discusses standards, best practices, privacy concerns, and such is not a bad idea. It'd be good to know that an exchange went through independent peer review and is considered "as safe as we can make it". The discussion part is actually not far off from what the Bitcoin Foundation does now, really. The problem comes in when we either give that body authority over the  protocol or they get large enough to force it. When that body can make decisions on what they think is best despite the community, they become a central  authority enough to possibly cause a schism.

In the Purchases sheet you would need to gather the date purchased, amount of BTC purchased, how much you paid, the fees you paid. All of this can be downloaded from Coinbase. If you got them elsewhere, get your receipts. 
On the Storage sheet you can put in the public address of a "paper" wallet, the private key (I store them password protected), the number of the password (I use 20 different passwords) and the amount I stored.
Look at the examples I left in for more details.

I understand what you are saying. I'm notsaying you're wrong. I think the perspective difference is that my view on investments is like my view of loaning money. I don't loan money I expect to see back. I assume immediately that it is lost. If I can't afford to lose it, I don't loan it. If it comes back, great. If not, it's a loss and I don't loan to that person again. It's the same with investing, to me. If I can't afford to lose it, I don't invest it. This, to me, equates to your "disregard the initial cost" suggestion. A paper loss is not a paper loss to me because it's invested, loaned out, numbers in the wind, and I have no expectation that it will ever return. If it falls too far I assume a loss, sell, and forget about it. If it performs well and I'm happy with it, I sell, reap my rewards, and forget about it. I have hopes that all my loans and investments return my money, but those mean nothing really. What matters to me is realized gains and losses,  if the money comes back or not. So, while my numbers are in the wind, I see no gains or losses. The results are still out until my actions cause them to be realized.
The difference with Bitcoin, to me, is the spend and replace tactic. I buy and hold, for the most part. But when I spend, I immediately set up an order to replace. I don't do that with other investments. They are like more like loans. Bitcoin is the first one I really see as an investment.

Just to be clear, here, I am not accusing you of anything. I only requested more evidence to clear up the situation.
Now, seeing the sheer volume of fiat we are talking about here, it's no wonder you tripped some alarms. That volume is definitely going to set off bells at Simple (because they are a fiat bank), FinCEN, the IRS, etc. They are all bound by rules governing fiat and money laundering. There's no way around that now because your BTC touched your USD. All I can suggest to you is to do your best to get some records together from the places you purchased them and your mining software/pools. Anything you can get like email confirmations, spreadsheets, transaction lists, etc. might help. Once you made it that big, did you engage the services of an accountant? If not, I'd call up a tax lawyer pretty soon. Perhaps both, really. I'm guessing you're going to get a visit from some G-men. I'd start preparing.
Again, I'm not accusing you of anything. I fully believe you're legit here. I wish you luck in clearing this up.

Ok, I love BTC, I hate banks, and I dislike a lot of what government does, but this is getting blown out of proportion. It's not government just raiding accounts like they did in Cyprus. It's the government reclaiming seemingly abandoned accounts. If you have a savings account for three years and neither withdrawal or deposit from it for three years, it's probably abandoned. Just make a bloody transaction occasionally and you're fine.

No, he was requesting that a standard be changed based on one experience in a specific setting instead looking for a simple, non-technical solution that could have solved this whole problem. If onlookers were commenting that it was hard to pay with Bitcoin, it could have been put aside by saying, "Oh, the issue here is not Bitcoin. It is simply that my camera cannot read the barcode out here in the bright sunlight. See how hard the screen is to read out here?

No, Thomas Jefferson argued that the government should print a value based currency, notes on a gold standard for example. James Madison, on the other hand, argued that a private central bank was needed to print fiat currency that could be inflated or deflated artificially, like the Federal Reserve. Jefferson believed that the power of printing the currency should be a government power, not one in the hands of a private business. 
How it relates to Bitcoin: neither can be artificially inflated. Arguably, the notes on a good standard can be inflated, but not without some people getting angry.

Nope. Each individual address will only show the Bitcoin that got sent to that address. Your Trezor contains a string of addresses based on a seed. But your Mycelium wallet can see the whole string of addresses. It shows you the next available, unused address in the string. You wouldn't want Blockchain to see them all for security reasons, by the way.

By adding, do you mean that you swept the wallet or imported the key? They are two different things. If you imported the key, the satoshi would show in both because both hold the private key. If you swept the wallet the satoshi would have been moved to a new address controlled by Mycelium.

@_date: 2016-01-05 02:23:20
The technical answer can be found [here]( The short answer would be that a "seed" is used to derive a string of addresses. And it's not one private key that can access multiple addresses. Each address has a key. Your wallet software that creates the wallet keeps track of all of them for you. Any software that supports BIP 32 can recreate the wallet as long as it's given the same seed to work with. I'm sure you can figure out a way to use BIP32 to create some sort of automated escrow, but I'm not the guy to help you with that. And, as for the 15 minute timing, I didn't even know that was in there. I'll have to see if I can figure that part out.

Maybe like how amusement parks do priority passes. As time goes on and more people invest the price of investing goes up. And maybe investing is based on price per percentage point. Early investors can buy percentage points cheap, but as more investors come in the points become more expensive. But early investors can sell percentage points later to cash out. And, like Bitcoin, points can be fractioned.

Thank you for this information. I will add an update to my article to reflect the information you gave me. I was not aware of the $200 gain threshold with currencies. As I said in my article I'm not a tax professional. I just know that treating it as stock for reporting but treating it as currency in usage is blocking adoption for many users I talk to. Whether it benefits from long-term reduced rates or not, the focus appears to be keeping people focused on long-term, slowing the number of transactions, slowing the adoption rate, making it cumbersome to use, and killing adoption quietly.
And could you point out exactly what you disagree with in my article? I don't see where I endorsed one over the other, honestly. The fact that I listed them both as options is the first key that I at least find the offerings themselves to be likable to some degree. I tried to be impartial and give an initial impression of them. I listed Libra Tax first simply because I had to choose one with which to start and then the other always gets compared to it. From looking at the offerings, primarily the layouts and wording on the sites, my initial impression stands.
The Libra Tax front page talks about the tools they offer, their About page with names I can look up on LinkedIn goes straight into what makes their team knowledgeable, and they have a section dedicated to offerings for individuals right at the top under Products. This gives the impression that they know what they are talking about and they give me what I need to do my taxes. One thing I really didn't like, which you were kind enough to point out, is that they don't list prices right on their page... anywhere. That makes me not even want to bother signing up because it usually means it's outrageously expensive. The $19 to $49 price really isn't that bad, to be honest. At least on the surface, anyway. But what that $19 to $49 buys you is the important part.
The BitcoinTaxes front page does have a link on the front that says Free, which is certainly a selling point. But the front page talks about if you're looking for a tax professional or are a tax professional. Then more about being a tax professional. There is then a list of tools but by now I have the impression that they are for a tax professional to use while they are doing my taxes. Over and over again, down the front page, this is the case. And there is no About page at all. Why should I trust the writers of these tools to be knowledgeable on taxes or Bitcoin? And, to top it off, there is a giant disclaimer at the bottom that I'm potentially getting financial and tax advice from a place that doesn't stand behind their financial and tax advice. Not to mention that there is an entry in the FAQ that BitcoinTax is not a tax prep service and to call the third option I listed, Tyson Cross.
**tl/dr: Libra Tax looks like tax professionals who dabble in Bitcoin writing software tools for individuals. BitcoinTaxes looks like Bitcoin professionals who know software writing tools for tax professionals.**
While this may be a case of a mistaken impression, and I'm really truly guessing that it is based on other things I've read about it, it is indeed the impression that is given. But I had to dig up other reviews and screenshots to get past the impression the page gave me. To be much more clear on the subject, I'd like to point out that **what I've written here is not even a finished review. I don't want to give readers some kind of a bad impression of either service at this point.** My regular readers know that my educational articles tend to work off impressions because I simply point out services, features, tools, gadgets, etc. and gloss over them. As is always the case, my educational posts are almost always followed up with in-depth reviews of each service I talk about in the future, with which these impressions can be corrected. And, with tax season rapidly approaching, I do plan on doing a more in-depth review of Libra Tax and Bitcoin Taxes very soon. I really want to try out BitcoinTaxes, as well as Libra Tax, this year. At that time I will write a much more fair review of both services.
Again, I really like the look of the BitcoinTaxes service and I'm excited to try it out. Thank you for taking the time to read my article and correct me on wrong information. I am open to suggestions and constructive criticism. In that same spirit I hope you take what I've written above as constructive criticism and not some kind of attack on you or your service.

Coinbase and Uphold are generally it for brokers.

You should be able to send to the ATM using the Coinbase mobile wallet. When it shows you the QR code you use the send feature in the wallet and take a pic of that code.

Do you mean Square Register or Square Cash? I'm assuming you mean can you use Square Register to run the Shift card and transfer money from your Coinbase account to your Square account and then have that money show up in your bank account, correct?

Coinbase is a great entry point into Bitcoin. I always recommend users start there or Circle and then branch out. This is how the tutorials on [my website]( start out.
@_date: 2016-01-23 20:33:32
I recommend it when it's free. I personally use [Minergate]( but I use it in a specific way. You sign up and use the Web Mining section. You then have your computer add a smidge to the hashing power of some alt-coin when it's bored. And then you run that alt-coin through a converter like [Changelly]( to get Bitcoin bits out of it. In that case you use it like it's a faucet that you don't have to click on every 30 minutes or something.
I certainly don't recommend paying for hashing power, though. As someone else here pointed out, there's no incentive for them to share profits with you. They already own the equipment and are making a profit off it. Why sell a share to you? Mining ventures need to drum up capital, spend it on equipment, then share dividends in order to work properly.
@_date: 2016-01-19 16:10:27

I guess that all depends on what you're doing. If you mined them or bought them, selling them as an individual should not be a problem as long as you pay your taxes. If you're selling them as a business, you'll likely need a MSB (Money Services Business) license. Talk to any lawyer that deals with money or a CPA. If they don't know, they know someone who does.

You can read up on paper wallets on my website, [Incorporating Bitcoin]( They are safe, just keep the private key half of the wallet secret. But showing him the potential of Bitcoin by printing off paper may not do the trick. Coinbase and Circle are great, easy on-ramps into the Bitcoin ecosystem. I usually tell new users to start out there. That's all in the tutorials on my website, as well. But, in the long-term I generally point new users at Copay.

Bitcoin Mining is over for individuals *at this time*. I wrote an [article]( illustrating why. The numbers are a little out of date, but you'll get the idea. However, if there is a dramatic price increase, a drop in hardware price, or a release of new hardware, things may change.

And a Bitcoin is just a number and everyone knows you can divide a number into a smaller number.
@_date: 2016-01-27 20:55:44
Circle would be my vote too, but it's kind of a wash, most of the time. There are no fees, sure, but the price per coin is typically a bit higher.
@_date: 2016-03-26 22:27:56

Nope. Sometimes a prepaid will get through the system until someone finds out. The issue is Anti-Money Laundering laws. It's too easy to turn illegal cash into gift cards to then turn into Bitcoin. This is the "layering" step in money laundering.

The only reason you need a private key is to send funds. Your wallet software handles the private key for you in the background. There are ways to get to it, but why do you need it? Just send the funds to whichever wallet you choose. If you're new, maybe check out some tutorials and educational posts. I have lots at [my site](

Easy doesn't mean correct.


Anti-Money Laundering regulations and Know Your Customer guidelines.


Transactions have to settle.


You'll have to clarify this one. You can't do a transaction without confirmations.


Transactions failing and retrying. Sounds like your impatience caused some shit. This is bad. But it's not money laundering.


How judgemental. I'm assuming your anger is getting the better of you.


Maybe try some manners?


Did you call your bank? They could verify that it was in queue. Transactions using banks take time. This is a failure of their system, not Circle or Bitcoin.


No they're not. And no they didn't. A situation involving your impatience using an old banking system did.

You're talking about moving $50,000 USD. At that quantity you're going to trip all sorts of AML/KYC laws if you don't do it in some legit way. At this point there are going to be fees for doing something legally. And there are probably always going to be fees for converting to and from BTC to literally **anything else**.
* Easy
* Cheap
* Reliable
Pick two.
You could always teach someone to use Bitcoin. You could then send them Bitcoin directly and they could worry about how to turn it into their local currency. But Bitcoin is in its infancy. You can't expect it to just magically solve your remittances problems, especially at this stage. That's not a Bitcoin problem. That's a problem with adoption. Get more people into Bitcoin and problems like these will get resolved.

You have not lost any money. It's just not showing in your wallet because, as you suspected, your copy of the Ledger is behind. Get a thin wallet like Copay. Export your private keys from your current wallet. Sweep them with Copay. You'll be all set.

Why? What's your problem? It pisses me off that people bring this shit up like they're saving someone from something. Like it's some kind of crusade against some vile plague of some kind. This is exactly what affiliate links are for. OP asked for information and here provided the answer. He referred OP to services that would provide the service for which he/she was looking.
The rules all state no posting referral links just to drive traffic, meaning new posts. Affiliate links are perfectly acceptable if used in the manner used above, a referral. If OP wants to be a dick and chop the referral part of the link off before signing up, that's his/her business. But it doesn't hurt him/her, doesn't change his/her service, to sign up under the referral. So why anyone would do that, other than to be a dick about it, is beyond me.
Referral links, as long as they aren't used as spam, hurt noone. In fact, they provide incentive for people to go out and let others know about a service they themselves like. So, out of fairness, cut the crap.
@_date: 2016-01-31 19:17:55

Not a prepaid card, man. No legit site will touch it because it's an easy way to launder money. Places like Coinbase and Circle would get thrashed by FinCEN here in the states due to AML (Anti-Money Laundering) regulations. Outside of here, I'm sure it'd be frowned upon as well. With prepaid, you're pretty much stuck with whomever will take the card off your hands. You could always go to [Purse]( and spend it on someone's goods and get the Bitcoin from that, but you're going to pay a premium on the price there as well. Either way, you're going to take a hit.

Breadwallet stores your private keys in your phone. Coinbase stores your private keys for you. If you don't control the private keys you don't control the Bitcoin. Read more in an article I wrote [here](
@_date: 2016-01-24 18:42:57
It's not a bad storage idea. I used to use an old, unused, Android phone with Airplane Mode on all the time. I installed a program called Android Paper Wallet. I would use it to generate wallet addresses and keys, but I would use 1 of 20 passwords to BIP38 encrypt the private keys. I would send between 0.01BTC and 1 BTC to those wallets. I would then use a spreadsheet to keep track of the wallet ID number I gave it, the public address, the BIP38 encrypted private key, the password number used on that wallet, and the amount I stored in the wallet. I then put the spreadsheet on multiple SD cards and stored them different places. All-in-all, not a bad storage scheme.
But a hardware wallet makes this much more simple, and not very much cost difference. An [HD.1 from Ledger]( only costs about $15. If you're worried about multiple copies, get the multisig edition for about $40.
@_date: 2016-01-30 17:29:24

@_date: 2016-01-30 17:26:37
Yep. But that's going to be rare because it's arguably breaking the Anti Money Laundering law, there's little way to trace it, there is the risk of fraud that you charge back the transaction through PayPal, etc. Again, you may be able to find someone on one of the sites I linked that will be willing to deal, but you'll pay a much higher price.

@_date: 2016-06-02 22:52:17
I never said you're an idiot. I said you're one unhappy customer among thousands of happy customers. Your situation is unfortunate and I agreed with that. Indeed, Coinbase needs to do their due diligence to resolve your issue and make things right. But taking to the Internet, jumping on the soapbox, and telling everyone to stay FAR FAR AWAY because you in particular had a bad experience is blowing things way out of proportion. 
@_date: 2016-01-30 20:13:28
My first piece of advice would be to do it gradually, not all at once. That's a large amount of money. I would personally store it as BTC and convert it in chunks like once a week. You would be subject to market swings, but they're not that bad these days. And who knows? You may be part of a really good one. But holding a bunch of BTC is much easier than securing a giant stack of paper money.
A more direct answer to your specific question is that I do not know the difficulty of converting an amount that large. Mainly because it depends on the country in which you reside. I could probably convert a few thousand a week using known services and staying above the table, but I'm in the US. I have no idea what it's like converting in India.

You don't see threads popping up all over Reddit every time Wells Fargo had a system error and double charges debit cards. You don't see threads popping up all over Reddit every time Citibank takes a day off for a bank holiday and someone can't process a deposit the exact moment they want it. People get upset, sure. But they act like grown adults, contact support, and wait a few days to see results of a proper investigation which usually results in correction. Expectations like this don't work in the business world. So either this is some kind of coordinated attack on Coinbase or people are getting their entitled skivvies in a fucking twist.

Gobs of money they shouldn't have been investing if they can't afford to lose it. I'm not saying it's OK for it to disappear, but if it does and wipes someone out completely, they carry a significant amount of responsibility for it themselves. Invest like an adult.
And the support structure is laid out before people sign up. They offer email support. That's what they offer. Does speaking with someone directly imply you won't wait for results? No, it does not. Often times you're told by banks that they have to investigate and you still wait. Read the agreements and deal with it like an adult.
Now, I do think they should add support staff, but I don't think they should have to change their business model. Shorter response times would benefit then greatly.
@_date: 2016-06-11 16:08:00
Also, can you provide some transaction numbers where you sent multiple transactions to a Coinbase address and they only showed up the first time? I'd like to see that...

I'm complaining because it's not security if it hinders the consumer. I should be able to control my account from my account page, which is already protected by my credentials and two factor authentication. Their security required me to discuss account changes with personnel, didn't take into account real world factors, and they required document uploads because of it. Send us your driver's license because you contacted us that your email is going to change in the future isn't security.
@_date: 2016-06-16 01:38:35
Did you contact support? I'm being they could tell you what to do to make your account compliant.
@_date: 2016-06-11 15:59:44
You're supposed to use a new address for every transaction for security and privacy reasons. Any modern wallet will do this for you. It will also store the old addresses and private keys. You will still work. You just shouldn't.
For access on Android and PC, use Electrum. Link them using the same seed both.
@_date: 2016-06-04 22:05:38

Do not invest more than you can afford to lose. Do not imagine how you'd react if you made the right decision and got rich. That's easy. Imagine how you'd react if you made the wrong decision and your money evaporated. That's what you should base your decision on. If you have it to spend, spend it. If you don't, hold on to it.
@_date: 2016-06-02 21:07:13
Good on you. Now start a campaign against undercooked chicken because of that one time you got salmonella. Then move on to boycotting a theme park because that one time you were sick on a roller coaster. Coinbase processes thousands of transactions a day. Unfortunately, something went wrong and you were negatively affected. So, naturally, we all have to campaign to boycott them, right? Not a chance...
The point is that their support people are the only ones that can fix this issue that happened to a significantly low number of users. Again, it's unfortunate you had an issue. I hope they resolve it in a satisfactory manner. If I were you I'd ask them to cover fees and charges as well. I hope it works out. If it doesn't, then come back and I'll have a totally different reaction to your story.

@_date: 2016-06-14 02:31:38
Technically, you're supposed to record every transaction for capital gains and losses calculations. If you follow it to the letter it can be a pretty big pain in the ass. I actually have a post where I discuss this very topic. This led to another post where I detail my experience doing my taxes this year in April. I talk about the rules I had to follow and what tools I used.

You both reek of desperation. Fucking stop it. It makes you both look like shitty, jealous, scams.

Cool story, bro. Do you have any proof?
@_date: 2016-02-10 02:31:56
Good luck, man. I'm all for learning, too. The link will be there if you need it.
@_date: 2016-02-26 15:21:17
This is a terrible idea. You're going to get scammed. The minute the buyer has the coins they're going to get eBay or PayPal or their credit card to reverse it.
@_date: 2016-02-26 18:34:28
Then, and I don't mean to sound rude here, but you're kind of stuck. The LBC seller is going to see the same thing the bank does: possible laundering. They probably have to follow AML/KYC if they're licensed in an area. You're going to have to explain it somehow. If you're lucky they may give you a deal, but you're still going to pay a premium just due to the fact that they're running a business too. They're out to make money not provide a free service.
@_date: 2016-02-17 05:48:41
I said pretty much the same thing in my review. The interest is real, but I don't feel the risk is worth the reward.
@_date: 2016-02-09 09:16:16
Personally I tell new users to start out on Coinbase or Circle. Once you get used to how Bitcoin works, I encourage you to move forward. But if you're dead set on keeping your bank account out of it, I'd recommend Copay as a wallet and then buy through LocalBitcoins or an ATM if you can find one. As for storage, it really depends on how much you're looking to store and for how long. The Ledger or Trezor lines of hardware wallets are superb.
I'm sort of biased, but I always push new users to get started using the tutorials, reviews, educational posts, and opinion articles on my website, [Incorporating Bitcoin](
@_date: 2016-02-19 15:16:47
The truth is that you can make that work, but you're not going to make any money from it. CPU and GPU mining are days gone by. If you're looking to learn how Mining works then go for it. If you want reasons, explanations, and sources, read the article I posted on my website titled [Should I Start Mining Bitcoin?](
@_date: 2016-02-09 04:45:05
I hold in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-02-27 20:52:35
And encrypted wallets with backup seeds can be rebuilt without backup files.
@_date: 2016-02-07 21:14:23
Bitcoin is nothing but a giant ledger of ins and outs. It's accounting backed by cryptography, mathematics, consensus, and computer power. Ownership comes into play when bitcoin is sent to an address. You don't actually hold something physical. You don't send an item of any kind to someone. You own the key to that address. The key allows you to send the amount in that address somewhere else. Or, for as long as you choose, you can not send it. As long as you don't send it, you own it. This is what makes it so you can't counterfeit it. You can't hold a physical object with the ability to duplicate it. You can only choose when and where it numbers are to be sent.

The Institute programmed that model well.

Is this your project, Op?
@_date: 2015-07-28 23:50:50
I thought I had this covered until I heard about the problems with Bill Pay For Coins. That made me sad. :(
@_date: 2016-02-25 01:50:02
Every gas station I've ever been to and used my bank debit card put a hold of $25.
@_date: 2016-02-16 22:27:14
@_date: 2016-02-26 05:49:57
Because I can now get paid in Bitcoin and have that Bitcoin deposited to a wallet I control. I can then transfer Bitcoin to fund one wallet at Coinbase with Bitcoin. I can then use my Shift card to spend that Bitcoin at retailers that won't accept Bitcoin. It's about me getting to live off Bitcoin without having to convince others to use Bitcoin. It has nothing to do with my personal info. It has everything to do with not using fiat.
@_date: 2016-02-18 20:46:21
There are several Bitcoin debit card options out there. Some cards are better than others. The question is really about region. Xapo, for example, can't ship cards to the US. In which country do you reside?
@_date: 2016-02-17 21:26:31
You're [half right]( Slander and libel are both defamation. Slander is spoken. Libel is written.
@_date: 2016-02-06 19:37:53
So? If your way is so much better, don't worry about them. Convince other people to start coding your alternate. Convince other people to start running your alternate. Convince other people that your alternate is right and the Core won't bloody matter. It's just one version of the software. It's not like they have a lock on open source software. Nobody owns the protocol. Why does this whining continue?

They **are** a Bitcoin company, bound by the laws in which they reside. To think otherwise is absurd. And to suggest shunning is to close an on ramp into the Bitcoin ecosystem. Once embedded, a user can learn. Take this fight up with the people that can change the laws, not the ones that live and operate under them.
@_date: 2016-02-02 16:19:43
Circle, Coinbase, or Uphold, probably.
@_date: 2016-02-24 01:25:45
I wrote an article for my site about [taxes]( It should give you some options.

Then our conversation has come to an end. I'm not here to teach you how true democracy works.
@_date: 2016-02-15 16:51:33
Depends on your location, I'd guess. You could get it and corner the market in your area.
@_date: 2016-02-24 18:16:36
Hmm. Send all of it to a wallet you control. I recommend Copay. Then send small amounts to Circle to sell, one completed transfer at a time.
@_date: 2016-02-04 19:45:11
This guy won a Bitcoin for this article? Damn. Except for the inflammatory clickbait headline I wrote basically the same arguments in an educational post on my website, [Incorporating Bitcoin]( Maybe my headline "What Is Bitcoin?" just wasn't insulting enough.

@_date: 2016-02-01 01:53:46
There's a writeup on my webpage titled [Should I Start Mining Bitcoin?]( Give it a look. Maybe it'll answer your questions.
@_date: 2016-02-24 17:40:47
No. There are a lot of people that understand private blockchains miss the point.
@_date: 2016-02-16 02:55:27
On Circle's webpage, when you hit Buy Bitcoin, it brings you to a page with a link to how Circle calculates their price. Here's a direct quote:


You will be quoted one competitive bid/ask price for buys, sells, and currency conversions. The exchange rate for bitcoin to dollar goes up and down based on the market for buying and selling bitcoin. At Circle, we determine a single competitive buy/sell price for our customers. We arrive at this price by aggregating data from a range of leading exchanges. There is no spread on these smaller purchases, sales, or conversions.
If you are buying, selling, or converting larger amounts, you may be subject to a higher buy price or a lower sell price than you would usually see for smaller amounts. The buy or sell price will be quoted to you before you complete the purchase, sale, or conversion. Keep in mind that Circle will still not charge a fee on top of this spread, and the quoted rate at the time of purchase will be the rate that you receive.
@_date: 2016-02-24 22:15:17
Yeah, I noticed this when they held $75 when I paid at the pump. My bank only holds $25. WTF, Shift? I love you, but damn...

Yep. Namecheap is awesome. I host my site there.
@_date: 2016-02-09 02:06:07

Get an account on an exchange. Usually no limits there.
@_date: 2016-02-27 20:17:08
There are some advertising networks out there that focus on Bitcoin related advertisers and use Bitcoin as their business model. CoinURL is one I use on my site.
@_date: 2016-02-13 02:50:59
Coinbase + Circle + a few exchanges = limits expanded across platforms.
@_date: 2016-02-18 03:09:33
It's not insane. It's just another tool to squeeze more money out of people. It's also one of the arguments I use to encourage people towards Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-02-19 21:22:47
Well then I'm not going to get all emotional and abandon then until they announce it. I'll just mitigate my purchases until then. They're still a good service. There's just no discount at the moment.

Get a multi sig Ledger pack. You can get ten of them in one pack and give everyone involved a stake in it.
@_date: 2016-02-03 17:06:49
I'm a big fan of the Ledger products, mainly due to price point. They are secure and cheap. I use an Unplugged for mobile and an HW.1 for long term. You can see reviews, tutorials, and use cases at my website, [Incorporating Bitcoin](
@_date: 2016-02-23 20:33:48
You mean other than trading fiat for it?
@_date: 2016-02-25 02:00:33
Which is why I don't think it's by area. I used this same card on a road trip and every gas station I used it at held $25. I know because I get a notification on my watch while I'm filling that a hold was placed on my account. And every time it's $25, no matter where I'm at.
@_date: 2016-02-01 20:27:19
If that's the case, send them the transaction ID. If they want you to sign a transaction, that's probably way over their heads.

@_date: 2016-02-28 18:56:30
Whomever is talking about raising the coin limit is delusional. And as to what Bitcoin wants to be when it grows up? It's a protocol. It can be all of those things and more. Layers can be programmed into it to function in many ways people haven't even thought of yet.
@_date: 2016-02-06 17:10:03
If it's not connected to the internet you may be fine. I'm not sure if the Envy series retains its memory after printing. That's the part you'd have to look up. Could the government office you return it to pull that memory after you return it?
Instead of the hassle, why not get a hardware wallet? A Ledger is cheap now.
@_date: 2016-02-09 15:38:32
I personally just buy some every week. But there's no time like the present.
@_date: 2016-02-24 18:17:15
OK. I'll look when I get off work.
@_date: 2016-02-27 21:00:06
Look, if you're happy with your backup, then be happy with it. It's certainly secure. I'm just trying to tell you that you're wasting your time here. You're going full bore overkill. And, in the end, you're not any more protected than I am. If someone wants your Bitcoin bad enough, they'll get them. But, if it helps you sleep at night, by all means continue.

@_date: 2016-02-27 04:49:25
I used to do something similar with a large number of password protected wallets, but instead of using passwords I could read and providing hints I just used a password wallet to generate random gibberish and record them by number. Then I just recorded which password number I used on each wallet.
@_date: 2016-02-17 18:58:43
Did you bring any proof with you, or just a story?
@_date: 2016-02-05 03:06:54
You're probably going to have to go through Purse, Paxful, or LocalBitcoins for this. If you live near a LibertyX seller, you could go there.
@_date: 2016-02-01 18:45:35
Are they asking you to prove that it was sent or to prove that you're the one that sent it?
@_date: 2016-02-23 05:04:12
Yep. It'll just fail and the coin will have never moved. You just send again with a higher fee. Or try again with the same fee. Maybe it'll be picked up the second time.
@_date: 2016-02-25 04:13:06
That's how much they held on your card? That's insane!

OK, so, English aside, because they aren't native speakers ~~$15m CNY is $2.28m USD.~~ Is this a problem? You have to have a net worth over $1m to invest in Grayscale here in the US. It's not uncommon to have minimum investment requirements.
@_date: 2016-02-06 17:19:50
So, invest it somewhere else. I'm having pretty good luck with BTCJam. There's a review on my site, [Incorporating Bitcoin](
@_date: 2016-02-24 19:12:55
Oh, and by "completed transfer" I mean put a little bit in Circle, cash it out, wait for the money to hit your bank account, repeat.
@_date: 2016-02-22 02:05:13
You could use your card to buy Bitcoin through Coinbase and then get a Shift card to spend it. I have tutorials on that in [my website](

I run a full node from home. It's on a baby computer underneath my TV. Yes, you have to open a port on your router, but it's not like that's unsafe. Your PS4, XBox1, phone, and anything else that uses your router opens ports. But it is a peer to peer system like BitTorrent. You're going to have a lot of connections every ten minutes when a block is found. It can be fairly bandwidth intensive from time to time.
@_date: 2016-02-07 17:31:57
OK. Thanks for clarifying.

Is this a marketing campaign by Coinbase or is there a public butthurt campaign against Coinbase right now? There seems to be a lot of these posts lately. They are supported by a comment chain to move to Circle or something similar. Then Coinbase shows up in the thread and works with the user to explain a mistake and raise their limits. The issue is then resolved with a happy user. An hour or so later it all happens again.

That's pretty much why I'm doing it. The more I teach, the more I learn. But, yes, it is difficult. Someone flipped their shit last night and downvoted an entire page of my posts. I guess they didn't like my answer. LOL Whatever. I don't base my success on imaginary internet points.
@_date: 2016-02-02 16:29:53
Possibly. But I've heard horror stories about moving large amounts that way. Best to use a broker.
@_date: 2016-02-07 22:16:28
It's not a file you can download, no. Not in the sense that you mean. It's not a file that gets transferred between places with records of where it's been. The data is not being sent from person to person. It's numbers on a balance sheet. It's all on the blockchain. That's all.

[Ledger HW.1, Multi-Sig edition]( You can give 1 to up to 3 family members involved, you can all put money in, but you have to get several people together to spend grandma's money. If there are more than 3 involved you can get Enterprise for up to 10.
@_date: 2016-02-07 17:25:46
I see. But it seems to me that what you've described is a case of, "doing it back".
@_date: 2016-02-21 06:23:09
Because you're not backing up your Bitcoin. You're backing up your keys. When you spent those Bitcoin your wallet told the network that you were spending them. You can't change the Blockchain.
@_date: 2016-02-12 17:00:33
Actually, that depends on where you live. You may need to register as a money business or have a money services license in your state. You may want to look that up before you invest to heavily in it.

I'm sorry if this comes across as presumptuous, but I think you're trying to run before you learn to walk.

I'm not difficult to persuade at all. You seem quick to cry fraud without any proof linked at all. You provided literally nothing other than a story. Technically that's grounds for them to sue you for slander. You'd bring the proof then, I hope, it face fines or prison.
As I just told the other guy to whom you're referring: I'm not doubting you outright, but you've cried fraud without anything at all to back it up. This is turning into a court of opinion and that's bullshit. Bring the proof and the community will back you up. Otherwise, take your lumps and move on.

Ok, two-parter here. Personally, I usually recommend Copay as a wallet for new users. It's built by one of the biggest names in Bitcoin, runs on everything, and is easy to use.
And mining is a losing venture at this point unless you're living in the arctic, get free electricity, and someone gives you mining hardware. There is no such thing as CPU or GPU mining anymore.
For more information look at the tutorials, educational posts, reviews, and opinion articles on my website, [Incorporating Bitcoin]( In particular, I have a review on Copay and I have an article titled, "Should I Start Mining Bitcoin?".
@_date: 2016-02-24 22:28:48
No clue. I didn't know retailers did it for sale if goods. I know gas stations do it to prevent drive offs. I'm not worried about the hold, I'm just upset at the difference in the amount held between the two.
@_date: 2016-02-15 03:25:40
Seriously, Mycelium and Copay are the best right now. I recommend Copay in my tutorials for new users that are just stepping from Coinbase and Circle. I do so because it runs on everything and looks and functions the same across platforms. You can also set up wallets across devices and even use multi-sig while doing so. I recommend Mycelium for more advanced users especially when using hardware wallet solutions like Ledger or Trezor.

If you're new, I discuss what I feel is the best way to get started in Bitcoin on my website, [Incorporating Bitcoin](
@_date: 2016-02-13 20:12:03
1. Bitcoin is a protocol like what email or the web run on. It's an open source technology. It can be changed to become better. It already has gotten better. It's not going to just stop. Email is not the same as it was 20 years ago. Neither is the web. In fact nothing you touch on the Internet is the same as it was 20 years ago. The idea that it would stagnate is absurd.
2. Centralization due to file size isn't the one people are really worried about. Storage is one of the technologies that is growing much faster than need. Bandwidth may be a problem. But Bitcoin will learn to handle it. Side chains, Lightning, and the new thing by 21 will all help.
3. Once Bitcoin adoption grows to a certain point you won't need to trade it for fiat script at a bank. As more people accept it and more people spend it, they'll just start doing it directly totally bypassing the paper. Look at OpenBazaar. As far as anonymity goes, I can't answer that part. But with JoinMarket, tumblers, and all the services that are being talked about, anonymous could return to Bitcoin.
4. It's 7 years old. Seriously... 7 years. Anything 7 years old is volatile. The US Dollar was volatile 7 years in. I would say that stability comes with time, but look at gold or oil and their volatility records. Fiat has the appearance of stability compared to those, sure. But the volatility comes from when you go to the grocery store or gas pump.

Sounds like a lot of hassle, honestly. There are much simpler ways to store your Bitcoin securely. At some point you just have to consider that, should you actually be targeted, you'd be disappeared into a black site and they'd run rubber hose decryption on you. Look at Snowden, Manning, and Ulbricht. For all their encryption and opsec, they weren't safe. To me the point of encryption is to balance it. I make it difficult enough to not be practical to break yet easy enough not to be a bother to me. Then keep my nose clean enough not to be a target.

Bullshit. The President is given a list of approved nominees compiled by the Federal Reserve. He can choose from a list of people they choose to lead.

@_date: 2016-02-06 19:07:10
Let's look at this thing without a victimhood complex getting in the way.
Coinbase says the following data was compromised:


None if this data is usable, outside of sending you a bloody birthday card, except the gift card numbers.


If you're using another service to log in, you're using bad password practices. If you're using the same 
password anywhere else, you're using bad password practices.


If you linked your Coinbase account and gave them access to all of your wallets you're missing the point of Bitcoin and how it can be used to secure yourself from things like this.
So, what is Gyft doing?


Users affected will have to change their passwords. Good. They should have done that whether they were notified or not. I have.


Users affected will have to log in again, if they do so at all. Good. Let's hope they follow best practices this time.


Although they don't explicitly say it, the wording they use to tell you to monitor your balances says to me that Gyft is going to remedy any missing funds. This will probably be as simple as emailing support with a grievance. 
And, what should you have done?


Stop feeling like a victim. Nobody outside of yourself and your immediate circle of family of friends cares about any of this data. They're not going to call you. They're not going to send you a birthday card. They're not going to drop by for tea.


You should be using a password wallet. You should have a different password for every place you log in. You should be using Two-Factor Authentication. Your point about hashed passwords means nothing if you're following best password practices.


You should never allow a service to have access to your whole account. Coinbase should allow you to create a wallet specifically to use with Gyft and only fund it when looking to purchase a card or three. Gyft should only connect to that particular wallet when buying cards. All your other funds should be protected. This is the way the Shift card works. Until this is put in place, linking the two is bad Bitcoin practices. Until then, use their Bitpay link and pay them directly.
You can have it easy or you can have it secure. But, also, going overboard from paranoia isn't going to save you from anything. In fact, you're probably going to make things worse.
Besides, coming in here and shilling about the benefits of credit cards in situations like this isn't going to get you anywhere. I'm not even going to touch on that subject.

But the fact is that you can't do business in Murrica without following the Anti-Money Laundering laws, for which people have to follow Know Your Customer guidelines.

I'm fairly sure you can't transfer Bitcoin into your bank. If you can buy Bitcoin with your money from wherever it is stuck now you can bring that with you anywhere. There may be fees for this, just like any exchange. It depends on the person or company you're dealing with. Once you get to wherever you're going you can probably use the Bitcoin to buy whatever currency is local. Again, you may pay for this service. It all depends on the market.

One of the essential problems. Another is cooling cost. Probably electricity in your case, so no worries. But hardware cost is crucial as well. What you need to look at in that case is expected return. Would you be better off buying a miner and waiting for the coin to come in? How many coin are you expected to get before it becomes unviable? Would you be better off spending the money you were going to spend on a miner directly on coin instead? Which would get you more coin?

I typically stop at the same 3 gas stations. One near my house, one near work, and sometimes one in between the two when I forget to go to one of those. Nearly always the same 3. On my bank debit card they put a hold of $25. Every gas station I've ever been to and used that card put a hold of $25. The one time I used my Shift card at one of those three gas stations I always shop at, and I can tell you which one in particular it was, they put a hold of $75 on my Shift card. The only difference was I didn't use my bank debit card, I used my Shift card. Are you telling me that gas station and/or chain suddenly renegotiated the holds they put on cards? I can't believe that.

It doesn't eliminate Coinbase/Shift or Bitwage/Xapo. It just requires that you transfer to those accounts from time to time and have the forethought to do so before you absolutely need it. You could also use them to go old-school and pay your bills with money orders by buying them with the card.

There's only one possible way I can think of. You have to wait until they deposit money into your account and then verify those deposits. The hold time is really at your bank, to be honest. If you're in a rush you could call your bank and see if they can see the transactions coming through before they're reported to your account.

So do a little research and see if a company has a good reputation instead of relying on a credit card company to return your money if they don't. You're paying someone else to protect you. Take responsibility and protect yourself. If we take responsibility and take back control then companies will live or die by their reputation again, as it should be.
This isn't about Bitcoin.

It only costs what the computer costs. Some run one on a Raspberry Pi 2. I just bought a very small computer. About $200 worth of parts. But I use it for other things while it's being a node.

You claim that you deposited money expecting to receive Bitcoin. You have not received said Bitcoin. There is a word for this. It is "fraud". I asked if you had any proof. You apparently do not. This is called "slander". I shouldn't have to suggest what proof would satisfy. The burden of proof rests upon the accuser, which is you. This is called "logic".

Are you a US resident visiting the UK or are you a UK resident? You do have to be a resident of the US to get one. But if you're a US resident and get one, the card itself is just a Visa debit card. As far as I know it works anywhere that Visa does. 
@_date: 2017-10-03 16:59:27


But you can't. Again, you're missing the point. Decentralization of control of money would remove the control banks have in how governments and economies are run. It doesn't matter if they are "filled with smart people". That's an argument from authority and a bad one.
Comparing banks to carriage manufacturers is relevant because it's comparing one business that was considered too big to fail to another one. Another example would be railroad cars. Another would be cable companies. Another would be land-line based telephony companies. Not to mention the "fad technology" aspect. Cars, radios, television, the Internet, email, Wikipedia... Leaps in technology often lead to arguments that they won't last, that they're fads, that they'll never catch on.
And your whole "what will you do if banks and governments decide you can only get paid in legal tender" question is moot. People buy and sell commodities with legal tender all the time. How is bitcoin different? The market is decentralized.
So, look at this realistically: the government can't ban Bitcoin just like they can't ban encryption. Why? Mathematics. They'd have to shut down the Internet to ban Bitcoin.

Right... And in every example I provided they weren't better in the early stages. Some were too expensive for people that weren't wealthy. Some were too complicated for people that weren't tech savvy. Some were products that had to be sold to build infrastructure to reach more people. Some were seen as fads that wouldn't catch on. Some were seen as the best tech that would ever exist ever and there would never be another tech to take its place. I can keep going... but this tired argument is boring. It's always the same arguments with people that try to bring Bitcoin down:
* Too expensive.
* Too complicated.
* Will be banned by government/banks/etc.
* Not solving any problems.
* Doing it wrong.
* Not backed by anything/Tulip Mania.
* No use case after the apocalypse.
If you don't want to use it, then don't, but stop bringing these tired arguments to the table.

Why would it bind you to Wells Fargo? The Shift card is a standalone Visa that connects to a wallet you create in Coinbase. Go get an account at a credit union or some other Bitcoin friendly bank and connect it to Coinbase for BTC/Fiat conversion. Send BTC to the Shift Card wallet in Coinbase to load it for use. Wells Fargo is not required at all. I use [Simple]( as a bank. It's online only, no brick and mortar locations, and is Bitcoin friendly.

What does a hardware wallet get you that a wallet that requires password and/or biometric confirmation to send doesn't? Create an Electrum wallet on Tails, record your backups in a password wallet, make transactions for long term storage. Use the XPUB to create a deposit only wallet on your day-to-day device. No malware, keylogger, or anything of the sort is going to get to that. How much does a 8GB flash drive cost? A lot less than a hardware wallet.

@_date: 2016-05-11 18:14:02
Ok, so... You buy from Korbit using an overseas bank account, then transfer bitcoin to Circle to sell using your US bank account? That shouldn't be an issue, as far as I know. But you should always use an intermediary wallet. Transfer to a Copay, Mycelium, or Breadwallet wallet and THEN to Circle. I know it seems silly, but that separation seems necessary.
Did you at least get to recover your bitcoin before they shut you down?

Jesus, dude. Your account is less than 2 weeks old. You've given support less than 24 hours to investigate. You're waiting on a bank system (SEPA), not Kraken. The more you spam the longer this is going to take because they have to look at every one of those messages. There's records for all of this. They'll find it and fix it. They always have. Kraken has a proven track record. Chill the fuck out.

It's because what you did wasn't wrong or illegal. Hell, I don't even think they think it's wrong. They're just covering their asses because the pattern of events make it LOOK like you MIGHT be buying and selling, which requires a MSB license in most states. If you don't have one they MIGHT be considered an accessory. They choose not to take that risk. But preemptive account closure makes them look bad as well, so they just stay mute about why.

Once you hit a certain threshold any money business in the US is required by law to question their customers about the nature of their money usage. It's due to the Know Your Customer (KYC) guidelines of Anti-Money Laundering (AML) laws. Doing business with a US based business means you're subject to this. And trying to get around it could draw scrutiny from law enforcement. Good luck...

Because you sent eight in less than a day, along with Facebook threats, LinkedIn threats. Businesses take time to run. You aren't their only customer.


And now you want them to allow you to harass them on the phone, too? These things take time to investigate. Have you ever dealt with a bank investigation? They're no different.


Because they aren't part of the banking system. That's the whole point of Bitcoin.


Which is why they need to look into it. Something obviously went wrong. But they can't just give you $10000 in irreversible currency without knowing exactly what.


Months to sort through millions of transactions to find the problem and fix it. Or did you not get that far? The part where they always fix it?
I would say that you sound like a petulent child, but then you wrote this:


At this point, if I were Kraken I would completely stop investigating your issue and contact a lawyer. Your level of contact is harassment. You threatened litigation. I would begin prep for restraining orders and countersuits for defamation. I would then make no moves without legal input. And I would take my time. You want to play the big boy game of lawyers, I'm sure their legal fund is bigger than your $10000 delayed transaction.
OR... you could send them an apology note and let them do their bloody job.

1. Ether is just another altcoin. Anything it, or any other altcoin, can do could be programmed into Bitcoin if there was enough demand.
2. Covering on losses? How so? If you fuck up or if they fuck up? Essentially, Bitcoin places the responsibility on you. That's much of the point. Get a wallet you control. Do proper backups.
3. Spend from a mobile wallet. Store in a hardware wallet. Transfer if you need to.
4. 
5. Weak ass bullshit versions, yes. They look what makes Bitcoin so powerful.
6. I like the fact that if you're feeling left out of Bitcoin you're missing the point. Anyone be a part because it's open.

No need to double up in the middle to randomize. If you're connecting yourself to Circle by verifying your identification, which you'll have to in order to transact in that volume, there's no privacy anyway. Have your parents purchase and send to your Circle wallet. Then sell it and have it sent to your bank account. If they have Circle as well there will be no fees at all because Circle allows you to send to another Circle member for free. If they don't have Circle they may pay fees for purchasing, but it depends on their broker. And there will be the miner fees, aka transaction fees.
@_date: 2015-02-03 19:07:12
Yes, I get that. But say, as someone else pointed out, the Satoshi coins moved... Say trust in BTC was lost... Say a different encryption was chosen as a preferred base... Say, once the majority came around to the idea of crypto, everyone choose to start over to level the playing field...
I'm not saying any of these are probable or even likely. I'm saying that it's possible BTC could be dropped for one reason or another and an entirely different coin than one we know presented and made standard.

So, what you're saying is, MaidSafe is the coin of the future because anyone can mine it by committing their unused computer resources to the network for which they will receive safecoin, is that correct? I just want to be clear here. Because you say that like it won't get exploited. What you seem to not understand is that, if there is a system, it will be exploited.
BTC started out with CPU mining and anyone could get involved. Miners were raking in BTC left and right. It was easy and anyone could do it! Then some people began to buy massive GPU cards and completely squeezed the CPU miners out of the game. Then some other people began making specialized computer that were nothing but rigs with multiple GPU cards that squeezed the miners with one card out of the game. Then someone got a bright idea to make Application-specific integrated circuit chips on hardware boards specifically to mine BTC. These ASIC chips completely squeezed GPU miners out of the game. And now ASIC mining continues to evolve. Cloud mining has become a thing.
Much in the same way, MaidSafe will have issues with the fat cats buying their way to the top with money, completely squeezing out grandma and her 1 to 3 TB she isn't using to store pictures of her grandkids. Oh, sure, it'll start with small users. But then someone will build a machine with nothing but multiple processors, maxed out RAM, and large storage drives just to commit to the network and rake in safecoin. You see, because of their rating system, this guy's dedicated box will get more action than grandma's computer, and thus squeeze her out of the game. Then someone will figure out that it'd be awesome to haul in an old NAS rack from a data center they picked up off Ebay and commit it to the network. This guy will squeeze the other guy out of the game. Then, someone will have the bright idea... Hey? Why take it out of the data center at all? Heck, let's set up a data center specifically for this purpose!
You see, if there is a system, it will be exploited. It's just the nature of the game.

To be fair, it is possible that Bitcoin won't be the chosen one. Anyone that is old enough to remember the 56k modem wars would do well to remember history. Everyone I knew bought a USR X2 modem. Being in the tech industry at the time, there was a lot of clamor about K56flex from Rockwell/Lucent. Back and forth, back and forth, for quite some time. And what did the industry settle on? V90. Granted, many of the modems we'd all bought earlier could be flash upgraded. But many of them could not. Anyway, my point is this: You never know where the dice will land. Make your bets and hold onto your butts.

1. Learn to protect yourself and hackers and thefts are not an issue. There is a system in place, but it puts the responsibility in your hands, not the hands of others. Sure, there is a learning curve, but it's like any other thing you have to learn.
2. I have had no difficulty turning cash into Bitcoin. I have only heard complaints from a very small percentage of Bitcoin users about the reverse as well. As I saidsomewhere else: People go out of their way to complain and blame the world when they are upset. When they get adequate service, they aren't likely to let the world know, and only slightly more likely to do so when they get good service. If the millions of Bitcoin adopters out there were getting bad service or having issues it would have outright failed by now.

So, don't get a Simple.com account and expect to buy Bitcoin with it? Is that the point of this article?

Money laundering is a bullshit crime, but it's certainly one you don't fuck with. This is exactly why I didn't start a business like this in Iowa. The big boys don't share power.

I know. I read the "New" queue every day and see posts about it all the time. This has been explained in the comments of nearly every thread that someone posts about it. It's coincidence. They don't reject every trade that happens during these wild price swings. They reject it based on bank information. If they did, we'd see a much higher percentage of those 650,000 users complaining, not the less than 1% of 1% we see now. And nearly everyone that contacts their customer service sees Coinbase honor the transaction at the contracted price. Granted, there is usually quite a bit of wait time because they've been flooded with new users and tickets, but it does usually happen.

I bank at a local bank. They haven't said anything yet. I would like to consider an Internet bank. I really would. Simple looked good until this article came out. BOFI (Bank of Internet) was mentioned on here as well.

I think these look awesome. When I get enough BTC to justify it, I'll seriously consider it.
@_date: 2013-12-17 03:04:59
Shit, I'm getting into mining despite the odds that I won't even break even. I'm holding what I've invested so far. Hell, even if BTC tanks, it's a fun experiment that I'm learning from. No worries here!

[Will I earn money by mining?](
Look into the hardware list. There is a profitibility calculater in there, too. Talk to your power company or check your bill for how much power is going to cost. It's all there, man.
Edit: As an aside, I'm looking to do it to say I did it. The hobby factor, more than anything else. The cost is worth it to me for that.
@_date: 2013-12-20 02:48:04
Out of curiosity... Where did you get your info?
@_date: 2013-12-20 22:37:44
Depends on what you call "worth". Are you looking to mine a zillion bitcoin and get incredibly rich in the next week? Yes. It's too late for that. Are you looking to mine a very small, steady stream, probably never offsetting the price of the awesome looking hardware that can serve as a conversation starter, maybe not even offsetting the cost of the power, in order to be able to say you did it while learning about how bitcoin is created and what makes it tick? [Yeah, you can do that](
@_date: 2013-12-20 03:18:45
Well, there you go. You're back in the running for when I change banks.
@_date: 2013-12-17 16:10:25
If you're looking for the steady stream of BTC, you'll get it with a Pi and an ASIC. But it's going to be a *very* slow stream. If you're looking for the electricity to be cheaper than what you make, you're probably out of luck with that setup. But, using your video game analogy, you play video games and don't sit there thinking of the electricity cost, right?
My advice: one USB ASIC probably won't do you much good, to be honest. That, and the price is inflated for them right now. They used to be $15. Now they're around $60. At this point, an ASIC is like a booster, not a workhorse. You'll get a lot more work out of a Jalapeno, if you can find one, but they are going for quite a bit on Ebay. Even then, it's a slow process at this point. The difficulty is getting too high at this point for small home setups.
My point is that, if you want to get in it to get in it and say you did, do so. But if you're looking to mine a lot of coins and get rich, don't bother. Buy your coins by investing.

If Blue Bird has a routing and account number, I don't see why it wouldn't work. You can verify the verification transactions on their banking site, so that wouldn't be an issue. I'm not sure about any Terms of Service violations, so you might want to look into that, but I doubt there are any written at this point. You should be good to go.

I have the RasPi for a specific purpose. I'm a console gamer. I have a Chromecast. I can do everything else that I need from my Nexus 10 and my Galaxy Nexus (replacing with a Nexus 5 this weekend), especially now that KitKat has printing on HP wireless printers. My laptop was just sucking power and gathering dust, so I sold it. I haven't owned a desktop in years.
The one thing I can't do is reload the SD card in the RasPi when a new version of MinePeon is released, so I just borrow a friend's machine for a few minutes. I can't see owning a PC just for that.

Mine just paid out. Still pending, but paid out. I did it killing time waiting for my first purchase to go through. I was bored enough to do it enough for it to pay out over the weekend.
I have a much better time with [BitcoinGet]( by the way.

Woud it hurt at all to have the option available to your customers?

I'll go 20% to charity! Competition in the marketplace!
@_date: 2013-12-27 17:53:52
I would say the positive is that it gives your customers options without detracting from your business. The costs at a place like BitPay are quite minimal for a business, overall. And, if it doesn't work out, give it up.
@_date: 2013-12-17 17:19:19
I'm not sure what to tell you about the last question. I'm not a fortune teller. I can tell you that if I mine Bitcoin and don't make a penny due to costs, I would not consider it "doing it wrong". For the price, the hobby part of it, being able to say that I did it, being a part of it, and the education process is well worth the investment of time and money. I could spend the money and time on video games and get only entertainment out of it. I could spend the money on booze and cigarettes (both of which I've given up) and get less than nothing out of it. I could spend the money and time gambling in my local casino and, odds are, get nothing out of it. At least, with this, I'm trying to do something, even if that something is a net loss in money. I'm still getting *something* out of it.

The only computer I have in my house, outside of tablets and phones, is my RasPi running MinePeon. If I buy a computer again, I will definitely consider it.

5 *business* days, not just days. I bought last Saturday, just in time for the tumble, and I won't have my coins, or ability to purchase again, until tomorrow. I missed buying again at the last tumble. :(

You have to remember that you're only reading from the people complaining. People go out of their way to let the world know when they are unhappy. When they receive adequate service, they won't. They might go out of their way when they receive above and beyond support. Remember that Coinbase has over 650,000 users now. How many of them have they upset, really?
@_date: 2013-12-27 16:56:28
