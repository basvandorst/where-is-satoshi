ppl r always investing.
ppl were saying the same thing at 10k.
lots of people still wont invest at $17k, but might at $25k.

which is why i said 'think' it's been almost a decade since...

basically for me, the only reason to invest into alt coins is because you think bitcoin wont work if ever adopted into the public. so you need to think of the flaws in bitcoin.
litecoin and eth seem pointless to me in that aspect. while iota seems promising and is very cheap right now. i bought 5 IOTA for example and spent like $20. 
if you consider where bitcoin is now that could be $80k in the future if bitcoin is replaced. 
i just dont see altcoins being viable at all once cryptocoin is established. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:57:41
smh... my late investment at 7k has only slightly more than doubled. abandon ship!
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:04:03
but what is the point of bitcoin anymore? you cannot viably use it as a currency anymore. 
is LN really going to fix this issue? i know bitcoin is THE brand, but I just dont see the point in it anymore. and why would the price go up? people are clearly pulling out and into alts.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:09:08
if youre losing moeny right now, it means you literally bought in the last few days.
if youre that worried about bitcoin dropping after rising so much, then get out now.
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:35:33
why is it bad for coinbase to profit? they provide a service.
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:06:03
i know. 
ive been following bitcoin since it was in the cents. the only reason i am now investing into bitcoin is because I have an actual bank account and career. 
it's super sad that I was following it since I think 08? not sure exactly, but there was decent talk about bitcoin on overclock.net due to the folding scene. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:05:57
oh it's still dippin... $16,800 rn
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:03:52
watch it and wait for the minor dip and buy. its gonna be $15k by end of the year max. wouldnt be surprised if by end of week..
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:19:21
tfw you dont sell at 19.2k and rebuy at 16k.
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:07:48
and then you lose out on any gains over taht week you dont have your coins available. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:01:53
i just dont get this logic. okay, say it is a bubble, what's going to pop it exactly?
the only thing that will pop it is if the US and/or maybe Europe outlaws it.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:58:07
literally said last week adn the week before
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:26:45
binance i believe. check out the iota subreddit. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:57:40
depends how important that $1k is. Could you lose it and only be sad for a moment?
If yes, hodl it. If you depend on it, take it out. Better to be fine now then suffer for gains. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:18:03
tfw i dont get paid til next week
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:11:07
i think iota is the one to do if youre not doing bitcoin. the rest seem pointless to me. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:12:10
@_date: 2014-02-05 21:25:05


so the entire appeal of bitcoins being anonymous is basically a lie.
@_date: 2016-01-26 20:49:28
wow, thanks! i'll see how that works. 
@_date: 2016-01-26 08:17:49
15 mins outside Flint, MI...
@_date: 2016-01-26 08:17:19
Couldn't I just Paypal someone who owns bitcoins and they send me BTC to my BTC address? Is there more to it now?
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:15:29


then i'd say yes.
if you want to gamble go for it. otherwise stay with the 7% consistent gains. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:32:37
yea its deff going to. it was stagnant for most of the day and it just randomly starting climbing. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 14:01:12
specifically i bought 0.01343275 BTC for $100. In a week that BTC value won't change, correct? So I'll still 0.01343275 BTC in a week regardless if +/- the value of BTC in a week?
@_date: 2017-11-02 19:35:24
you need to look at the other possible result. the one where it crashes and you lose.
i am/was the same, however when you think abuot how many people say, "if i could travel back in time and invest in apple/google", I think now is the time to take some risk if you can afford it and I finally can.
i probably won't see crazy gains, but i'd be surprised if BTC doesn't reach 10k by years end and that's still a massive gain. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:49:35
looks like it just plumpted some what out of no where tho
@_date: 2017-11-08 16:14:32
So say for Papa Johns for example. If I had segwit2x and wanted to buy a pizza, would their website accept it? Or would they have to put an option for Segwit2x?
@_date: 2017-11-02 14:35:38
i get bummed out cause im just now having money that i can freely spend/invest. i bought very little bitcoin in early 2016 however.
bitcoin makes little sense, but it keeps going up. i see the value in it, but i also see the skepticism. 
i recently bought $200 worth at like $6900. the last time i bought it was worth $450 and 1k was seen as crazy.
at this rate i really think $10k by the end of the year isn't uncalled for. 
maybe bitcoin folds in a month? maybe it goes up by 50%?
i honestly refuse to not be invested anymore tho. how often do people wish they could travel back in time to invest in apple or google? even if it doesn't work out, I'd rather lose a few thousand then regret missing out on tens of thousands if not more. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 19:01:57
I'm actually waiting on another $100 to go through on GDX. I was impatient watching BTC go up from yesterday so I bought some on Coinbase, lol.
I plan on holding for many months if not years anyway. I'm going in planning to lose it all. It's just so lame it happened this way, lol.
@_date: 2017-11-08 15:01:49
How? 
@_date: 2017-11-06 16:07:05
wait til you send thousands in BTC by error then see how youre talking. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 13:55:17
coinbase locks in my price tho, right? cuz im not really looking to sell just own BTC long term. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 03:16:41
care to explain?&gt;
@_date: 2017-11-02 14:41:59
i meant more like i dont have the btc in my wallet yet.
@_date: 2017-11-01 20:09:46
how come you just didnt cash out what you invested? then any gains after are pure gains regardless what happens? 
@_date: 2017-11-20 19:46:24
i just wish christmas wasnt so close. i want to invest more but i gotta buy gifts ):,,,,,
@_date: 2017-11-08 16:15:46
Can I do it from Coinbase &gt; GDAX? If so any reason to not put ti all into gdax instead of CB?
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:26:19
you were gifted $40k?
if you were gifted bitcoin then you a wallet of some kind i assume... just dont do anything with it. HODL
@_date: 2017-11-01 15:48:52
is that really fair to say tho? i dont think the value of gold really changes the value of the USD anymore. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 19:04:06
Are those the official shoes of bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-02 14:57:45
he was basically acting as a bank without the right licensees. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:39:26
im at .04 btc. i finally have enough income to start investing. sadly only bought $30 worth in early 2016. hoping i havnt come in too late. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 16:08:04
Is that the popular opinion on BTC? That it'll be a gold replacement, rather than a USD/currency replacement? 
Everything I usually read people act like it's going to replace USD/others. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 16:31:15
so what if i want to be lazy and not touch my bitcoin? i only have $300 worth right now. $100 on nitro betting website, $100 coinbase, $100 GDAX.
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:29:30
you just made him a millionaire (in 2020)!
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:46:55
i think it'll hit 1k again eventually. there's still hype about it. i'll probably buy 1/4 bit coin or something later today. 
the problem with bitcoin is you don't know if the US government will lock it down at some point. I honestly think they will, so I'm not willing to risk a lot for it.
This government hates not controlling something that has worth. Think about bitcoin. They can't tax it outside of sales. They can't seize it as easily to fund projects. 
i just don't feel the us government likes something like this just going around as they watch and do nothing.
