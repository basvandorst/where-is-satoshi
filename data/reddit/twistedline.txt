Zane you have been doing a great job but why have we not even had an official announcement of how much has been lost?

they still have assets behind it. It may just become in parity with the spot bitcoin price

those rants were great.

lightning network is a protocol - anyone can read the spec and write software to work for it. There is no owner, just like TCP. 
The transactions are bitcoin transactions using CheckLockTimeVerify, no tokens involved. In a *very* basic form its like a bar tab where all the bars in your town are connected together.  When you settle up its just a normal bitcoin transaction.

which is probably just

You could call it that. 
@_date: 2014-11-26 05:07:27
thanks for the confirmation.

I suspect they are wanting you to contract them to find out. It was a little strange though.

Maybe a stock like SNH,  its an old people real estate investment trust (REIT), those baby boomers are getting old and have plenty of $$$ to spend.
Also pays 6.9% dividend / year so even if it doesn't go up you still win
@_date: 2014-02-10 15:00:58
but you didn't mention anything about Transaction Malleability?
@_date: 2014-11-25 20:14:51
I'm up the road too. At least there's now one in DC. Jumbo slice is probably a little less awkward 
@_date: 2014-02-12 18:29:42
Apparently its gold coins 
@_date: 2014-12-14 05:44:26
its maybe too easy to buy. I use etrade I don't think is was hard to sign up, its been a while.
You can open a roth ira and just set it up reinvest the dividend.

I think the best quote is
"The Rise of the Phoenix world currency from the ashes of national fiat currencies ie. destruction of fiat currencies via hyperinflation. “Phoenix” is of course an occult metaphor. Out of the destruction, the ashes of the old world order, the Luciferian New World Order will rise like a Phoenix!"

Oh man,  I am so sorry.  I probably got you mixed up when doing research. I believe u/clp16 runs foldapp

this is on the inside [

Yep, I sent some coin there heard nothing back. Its run by u/kevincw02 I think. Messages him asking for a refund. Also contacted support...didn't get a response.  Its sad to see them keeping the site up and delivering nothing.  Its sounds like found an easier way to make money. 
@_date: 2015-11-14 18:36:25
sent to me from a friend, sorry I missed the right corner.
@_date: 2015-03-01 21:44:00
so they get a symbol? 
@_date: 2015-03-09 04:45:23
sweet, thanks! I will buy with btc after this next pump ;)

There is some comedy in those threads:

"People like you are dangerous and need to be exposed before someone in a position of power actually believes that you know what you are talking about. Bring your abacus."

yep - laws of physics apply.   It could still be high latency high bandwidth.
