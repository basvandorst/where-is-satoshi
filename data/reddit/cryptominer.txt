Off the top of my head: The BBC in the UK. The CBC in Canada. NHK in Japan. ABC in Australia.
Selling ads doesn't automatically turn a news organization into a worthless tabloid either.

He doesn't have the look of a heavy coke user. A heavy pot smoker maybe, but even in Japan he couldnt spend that much money on getting stoned.

*Real* news agencies. Newsweek is basically a tabloid so for them any publicity is good publicity.

If it is random like that then it seems more likely to be a power supply issue. What PS are you using and does it have plenty of extra capacity for your rig?

The issue isn't hiding, it is not being able to trust the US government to follow their own laws. Having data in the US is a Very Bad Idea if the business does not completely comply with US laws and regulations.

I'm actually in the opposite boat and assumed they required verification before I could even deposit. As such I missed some good opportunities while waiting forever for verification to complete.

I meant, it's more important to see the per-card hash rate rather than the overall cumulative hash rate. It is likely that one or two cards are having some sort of issue rather and that will tell you which ones.

I'm not the guy you originally replied to, I just ran the numbers.
Yes, 30 days in a month as I calculated above. I knocked 3 days off the GPU calc for the 10% cost of power. So we have two devices that cost about the same to buy and one uses more power than the other. Even with the power cost though it still produces 174% more hashes in a month. Not hard to see which one is the better value.

Financial regulations in Japan are *incredibly* strict. IMO it's only a matter of time before MtGox has to leave Japan to avoid being shut down and the owners arrested.

Not really. An ASIC is a custom-designed chip meant for a specific purpose. An ASIC designed for bitcoin mining can not be used for any other purpose.


One or more custom-designed chips (sometimes 100s of them) that are very efficient at doing whatever they were designed to do. They also use far less power than general purpose products like a GPU.
Costs? No idea. "Expensive" would be a good place to start though.

Sure he does. He owns a large position in Coca Cola, for example.

How do you get 10% profit loss out of that?
580MH/sec x 27 days (removing 3 days for power costs) = ~1,353,024,000MH/month.
300MH/sec x 30 days (ignoring power costs totally) = 777,600,000MH/month.
Looks like a 174% increase to me.

Mining with nVidia cards is pretty pointless. Higher end AMD cards are far better but buying an ASIC is likely the only way forward at this time.
Avalon has shipped a few hundred, their most recent units were 75 BTC each.
Butterfly Labs ASICs are far cheaper but they have backlog of well over 40,000 orders, many for multiple devices. So far they have shipped a small handful of their most basic devices, perhaps less than 10, definitely less than 100. Many people believe that BFL will never be able to deliver devices or that it is a straight-up scam.

Panama actually does have [their own currency]( it is pegged 1:1 with the USD. The USD is also legal tender in Panama.
Even if a country had no currency of their own would they not be affected by inflationary policies behind the currencies they use instead?

Well, there are a few points here.
First is that the USB ports in your computer are part of a hub themselves. For example in my i7 machine I have two USB host controllers running however many ports 7 or 8?) that the machine has.
With only two actual USB host controllers that would limit the mainboard itself to controlling up to 254 devices. Adding a separate controller or two via an add-in card would be doable of course.
Second issue is power. These devices need 500mA of power (.5A), the most that is provided per port by USB hubs. The bigger problem though is that most powered hubs can't actually provide that much power to every port. Designers assume that not all ports will need full power all the time so the power supplies and hub internals are under spec'd.
Next up is hub design. These miners are quite wide and most USB hubs place their ports quite close together. You can probably only use 3 or 4 ports on a 7 port hub unless you get short extension cables for every port.
Moving along we have the issue of daisy chaining USB hubs. USB only supports 5 hubs daisy chained together and the root hub is in your PC (see above). This means you can only daisy-chain up to 4 hubs off one port.
Finally there is the issue that connecting dozens (or worse, hundreds) of USB devices to your computer generally doesn't work very well. This is much better with USB2 than it ever was with 1.1 but there are still times when USB devices just stop working for no apparent reason and need to be unplugged and then plugged back in again to be reset. In most cases this isn't a huge issue. Scanner doesn't work? Unplug it, wait and plug it back in and all is well. When you have 100 (or 300) of the same device connected, how do you propose to know which ones are working and which ones are not? I see no way to know apart from disconnecting everything and then plugging it all back in again. Have fun while the computer recognizes all 300 devices and re-activates them.


So, 2 x 127 = 300?

What is your expected hash rate? (If you're not sure just describe your setup.)
At 2 gigahashes/sec (2000Mh/sec) the the current estimated time to generate one block is 255 days. If your hash rate is 1Gh/sec (still high for a single card) that estimated time frame would double to 510 days, 1.4 years.
With more and more ASICs coming online the difficulty is going to climb quite rapidly. It could easily end up taking 3 or even 5 years to generate a single block at 1Gh/sec.
So, unless you have a *very* powerful mining rig (10Gh/sec or faster) I wouldn't consider mining solo.

I would think that there would be a lot more money to be made on the transaction spread than there would be in wire fees.

Having your data center in the US (or other restrictive country) is not a good idea. MegaUpload is a good example of what happens in such cases, and that was just a file sharing service.

I'm not a banker but I have also given this idea considerable thought. I came to many of the same conclusions, mainly that the biggest issues facing BTC are:
1. 1st world banking regulations are not designed to work with something like BTC.
2. Reliable fiat&lt;--&gt;BTC conversions are critical to BTC's continued growth and success.
3. It's likely that any bank working closely with BTC could not exist long term within any 1st world country at the current time.
4. Somewhere like Panama would be a likely solution for this.
Since the bank isn't making any loans with fiat funds it is holding I assume it also is not going to be paying any interest? I also assume the bank's income would be generated by exchange spreads on BTC/fiat and fiat/fiat transactions?
I'm definitely interested and would like to hear more as you develop this idea.
Edit: What sort of time frame are you thinking of if you decide to move forward with this?

I don't think there is really an ELI5 way to do this. [Here]( is a tutorial that may get you started in the right direction but it assumes you have a fair understanding of things.
Alternatively you can just send your FPGAs to me and I'll take care of them for you. :D

If you join a pool you *will* make money with that hash rate. At current difficulty it should work out to about 1BTC per week in a pool.
Solo it would take ~6 months at current difficulty levels to get any return.

Since you would be running an exchange I would expect there would be a small spread on every exchange transaction that would go to the bank to pay for operations. Setting up something like this in Panama is not going to be cheap, hosting is pretty expensive there compared to the US.

You can buy Avalon chips, either via the [group buy]( that is going on or [off eBay]( 
Edit: It looks like Avalon plans to open source their FPGA design as well so you could (in theory) base a chip off theirs if you have the skills to do it.

Banking regulations in most countries (US, Europe, Japan -- so-called "first world" countries) have not been designed with something like BTC in mind. As such any exchange or bank existing in these countries is almost certain to face problems with regulators. This includes MtGox. When they get big enough there *will* be problems with Japanese regulators.
Panama doesn't have such restrictive banking rules which makes it an interesting place for a service like this.
The downside of course is also that it's Panama. If something goes badly wrong and the shit hits the fan you won't be getting any of your fiat back.
@_date: 2013-05-03 23:16:18
Rather than looking at the total hash rate I think you need to look at the per-card rate to see which card(s) is/are slowing down.
It's probably heat related and possible solutions would be:
1. Make sure there is enough space between the cards.
2. Make sure there is enough air flowing over the cards so that the hot air isn't getting trapped there.
3. Put the rig in a cooler location. Spring is here and temps are going up, the warmer ambient temperatures could be enough to push one or more cards past their throttle limit.
