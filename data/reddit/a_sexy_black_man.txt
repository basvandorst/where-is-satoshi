Somewhere a Bitconnect investor will read this and want to comment to one up you but then he will realize he bought Bitconnect and doesn’t want to look like an idiot.

We can debate about LN all day but the fact is as far as mass adoption and everyday payments it’s not easy to accomplish.

At least you didn’t lose 30k in IOTA 
@_date: 2017-12-24 01:48:30
That has nothing to do with the point I was making but I’ll bite. 
One of the main sayings in this sub is “technology evolves” in reference to bitcoins scaling and implementing the lightning network. 
Ethereum has made improvements to its security, and back to the original conversation, they have multiple ways they plan to further increase scaling beyond bitcoins current usage.

I remember reading a 4 Chan board years ago where a self claimed whale was looking to invite members to their group of 200+ members. Requirement was ownership 3000+ bitcoins. Sounds crazy but there isn’t without a doubt plenty of people who got bitcoin when it was under $1 and didn’t sell.
With that many people with 6,000,000+ coins, and if they are operating as one group you can manipulate the price for years. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:17:37
That’s just like.. your opinion man.

Giant corporations especially banks already use ripples system to make payments, this is completely aside of the cryptocurrency.

That fact hasn’t changed. But neither has the fact that bitcoin is profitable.

Channels have to be closed for the transaction to lock. 
You can check my post history, I wrote an entire argument of why bitcoin won’t work in and why Raiblocks is prime to replace it. Bitcoin is dinosaur blockchain tech, first mover advantage is a real thing. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:33:15


GTFO 
Like the lightning network for Bitcoin, Ethereum has not 1 but 3 plans to increase scaling &amp; speed. And it won’t take 2 years either, these implementations are Raiden, plasma, and sharding. Look them up and learn before you say something else that makes you look foolish. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:58:03
Lol what do IOTA users yell at XRB users?
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:59:05
The fact is the lightning network will not work for mass adoption. I can break it down for you why it won’t work from a technical aspect, the basic reason is, both users have to have bitcoin to activate a channel on the LN. That alone will leave the door wide open for someone to replace bitcoin as fees continue to climb. I’m a big Ethereum fan but even they have their problems. Like I originally said, I was answering OP’s question of who has solutions to scaling that is currently seeing bitcoins volume.

You just said a whole lot of nothing, or at least nothing that really matters. Yes bitcoin is all speculation now a days, I’m not denying that. But to say it has no value is stupid, it’s value by definition is the last price someone was willing to sell it and the last price someone was willing to buy it. The value of bitcoin at over 10k stems from the fact that it uses blockchain. The value of all cryptos stems from the fact that uses blockchain. It’s a trustless system that doesn’t need a bank, that is the value. 
The speculation aspect is why we saw the price dramatically rise, now it has corrected itself from all the weak hands and short term traders getting scared and opting out. Anyone still holding is more than likely not a speculative investor and sees value in having a blockchain based currency.

I’ve seen BTC have crashes that were just as bad or worse. This is nothing new 
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:43:50
I guess I’m one of the few that recognizes a possible correction after a massive 100 billion dollar + bull run. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:45:00
I see the opposite. More o the manipulation we saw last night + new dumb money seeing and thinking they can buy more shares of this new cheaper bitcoin, it will rise.

And what do you know, just like with cryptos newer and better all electric cars make gas cars look obsolete.

Agreed I saw a post about that read “Unpopular opinion, we need the government to come and regulate”. The problem is people think the government wouldn’t overstep their boundaries.

Exchange prices are isolated. They listed a new coin and everyone wants in. What is the conspiracy here?

If you would have put in only $5,000 into ETH in 2015 today you’d have around 4 million dollars and considering this is in Vancouver, I’d say he probably didn’t spend it all on that car.

I clearly said in my post that I am not denying bitcoins gains are all speculation, but the original value still stands which is that it uses blockchain technology. 
Disclaimer: i own 0 bitcoin, it’s dinosaur age, generation 1 blockchain tech but it still has value which originally stemmed from it using blockchain.

Anyone that knows a good amount of crypto doesn’t think bitcoin is good for anything except speculative profits, I guess we’ll have to wait and see. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:19:16
Yeah! That guy who took out a 2nd mortgage to buy bitcoin a month ago wasn’t gambling cause he made money! Tell these guys man 
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:35:10
Look I don’t hate bitcoin, but the fact is the tech behind is old, resulting in very high fees and transaction times, and the plan to improve it is not mass adoption friendly. As of right now all cryptos are tied to BTC’s price which is not good. We need a replacement asap.  
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:40:31
I have zero bitcoin and I was shocked and scared for the market as a whole when it charged past 12k and kept going .. and going .. and going. The real indicator that some crash was coming whether big or small was Charlie Lee selling everything 2 days ago. I strapped in my seat belt and here we go. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:43:54
I love crypto but as of right now it only has value because you can convert it back to fiat. 
Years from now I think things will be different but that’s the truth right now. We are investing in the future. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:32:45
Honestly and this is what I tell my friends that want advice: this world isn’t for average joe investors. If you don’t know what you are doing then you need to learn. If you can’t even figure out where to go to get info, serious info then that is an even bigger problem. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 10:33:11
Can someone point me to where it is written as illegal for cryptos? Yeah I’m pissed off like everyone else is but there is no law against it, this whole market is unregulated. And to be honest I’d rather the government not come and fuck up this nice thing we have going on cause chances are they’d over step their boundaries. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 00:03:48
Meanwhile some cryptos have all of these problems solved. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 03:54:13

@_date: 2017-12-24 04:54:17
The hardest part of crypto mass adoption will be the volatility in the price. 
Some people just want to make money which is fine, some want to see the tech also make a big difference which is where I lie. Either way like you said it’s going to be a bumpy ride. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:10:36
I’d agree until I read about the guy who got robbed at gunpoint for his 1.6 million dollars worth of ethereum. The robbers knew exactly what to do they just needed the keys.
