You can scan the private key with mycelium (cold storage spending) and then send the bitcoins to a wallet you want to use.

XBT has nothing to do with Bitcoin XT. XBT is just the ticker name for BTC just like the symbols XAU/XAG for the ticker names of gold and silver. 
For this ETN the XBT ticker is worth 0.005 btc and the price is shown in swedish crowns. so in your example 1 XBT at 9 crown means that 0.005 btc is being sold for 9 swedish crowns.

Also you could add a merchant version of the app (this would need functions such as printing receipts and private transactions using something like stealth addresses), for shops to use on an iPad. Also you could add tabs for returning customers, so they can pay their bills from the office or from their own home.
@_date: 2014-11-07 17:37:26

where are you situated?
@_date: 2014-06-12 07:52:17
Two more functions came up when I was thinking about a good wallet app:
You should try to add 'horizontal spending'. If you spend bitcoins the app sends out a buying order through the personal (bitstamp/ coinbase/ BTC-e) API of a user to re-buy that same amount of btc. This basically means that if someone uses the app and spends bitcoins, they automatically get refilled with new bitcoins. In this way people wont be scared to loose their BTC position by spending bitcoins.
You can also link the app to the persons location and have a list of places near to the user where they can go to spend bitcoins. For this you could use coinmap data and phone GPS location. I would like to be able to select a business type: restaurant, shop, cafe etc. and see if there are any near to me where I can use bitcoins.

I also dont understand this post? 
@_date: 2014-01-23 10:25:01
Download Mycelium on your Phone and you can then scan the private key and send the money to any adress you like
@_date: 2014-06-12 11:40:47
You can also combine a watch only wallet with an online wallet on the online device within one app. So users then have an overview of their savings-(offline wallet) and paying account (online wallet) all in one app. I would add an extra layer of passwords to view the offline wallet from inside the app so that when paying for small things the savings account would not be directly visible to other people. 
@_date: 2014-07-03 20:46:46
I dont have any and my brother who lives here has never heard of them, so I dont think they are used much.

Offer a 'cash back' discount on orders if customer finds a new customer that also orders from the site - [using referral link/code that is received at check out].
This will incentivize people to promote the website.
the 'cash back' discount can be built up of a percentage of the previously ordered product, and a percentage of the product that the person order with your referral link.

Yeah,  im not sure if vtc will succeed but its clear that all the gpu hashing power will go somewhere, people are too invested to stop mining with the equipment.

Thanks for the tip! I did not expect you Would actually pay for these tips, here are some more I hope they help!
Another thing you could add that Would be really nice is a qr code recognizer. This Would be usefull to send btc to an adress of which the qr code is on the screen of the device from which you want to pay. 
It would also be nice to add a selection of btc prices that are used by merchants that are displayed, examples: bitpay btc-price, blockchain merchant app btc- price etc. (since these can differ substantially to the bitcoin price used in man apps). This way users of the app will be certain they have enough funds on the device to pay the Bill.  
A way for you to increase the user base is by linking contact info of Phone contacts to the btc adresses, so users can invite their contacts to use the app and they will see names instead of btc adresses. This a lot more user friendly and motivates people to add their friends: new users.
Also you can add a function to split Bills.  Or maybe even add a who-pays-who function. (See  to see what this can be used for)
A final out of the box idea Would be to add offline transaction capabilities,  im not sure how this Would be done technically.  I would assume using sms service. This would be usefull when using the app outside the cellular internet region of ones phone contract, for instance when abroad and when there is no wifi. 
Good luck!

Not worth watching, the numbers don't make any sense the whole video is full of errors:
In the example at min 9:49 he says the price has increased 9 dollars a day the past 1410 days, that would mean the price should now be at least 12690 dollars.

Thats a good tip for them to do, they should also mention on the site that they accept bitcoin donations.

You can install bitcoin core  and replace the wallet.dat file with the one you have backed up. Or import it into electrum (which is faster).

If I win I would use the coin to go on a trip with the gf (who is a btc sceptic) and go to one of Andreas's talks. I'll try to pay as much as possible in btc. 
If I don't win I will be happy as well as it seems it will go to a good charity then.

In table 1 you mention properties of different Market types. The last property has a question mark "Physically
