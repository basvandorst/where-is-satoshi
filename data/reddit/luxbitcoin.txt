I got 1 cash transfer credited in my BTC-24 account 30 minutes ago (this was a transfer I had done to the Polish account)... but still nothing about the 2 transfers I had done to the German Commerzbank account...

They can't give you any information about their customers, forbidden by law ! In short: They won't answer you but instead hide behind "bank secrecy".

Dear Simon,
I did 1 transfer to the Polish account (Wed 10 April) and 2 transfers to the Commerzbank account (Wed 10 April and Thu 11 April).
When the site went off-line on Friday 12 April this money had not yet arrived in my BTC24 account.
I have 2 simple questions related to bank transfers :
1. Can you instruct the Polish bank to refuse the transfer (and therefore ask that the money is simply sent back to me) ?  (as the money had not yet arrived in my BTC24 when the site went off-line there is absolutely no risk for you to do so ! unless you want to keep my money…)
2. Can you instruct the German Commerzbank to refuse the transfer (and therefore ask that the money is simply sent back to me) ?  (as the money had not yet arrived in my BTC24 when the site went off-line there is absolutely no risk for you to do so ! unless you want to keep my money…)
I have 2 simple questions related to access to my Bitcoins :
1. Can you give us access to our Bitcoin account ? Please note that this access can also be limited to allowing us to send Bitcoins to do payments !
2. When do you reasonably expect us to have again access to our Bitcoins ?
Or will you only be back online when EVERYTHING is sorted out ? access to the Polish account, access to the German account, trading engine bug, new site 2.0, etc. etc. etc…. We all want at least PARTIAL SOLUTIONS and don’t want to wait until everything is perfect !
I would appreciate it if you could answer my 4 questions separately and as detailed as possible (explaining why Yes or No). Vague or short one-sentence answers do not help much as they often create more questions and doubts.
Kind regards,
A customer
