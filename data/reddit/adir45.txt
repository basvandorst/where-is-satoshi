@_date: 2014-08-08 11:53:33

@_date: 2014-08-06 08:17:02
George Osborne is a magician. You know why? Because there is no George Osborne in the topic about George Osborne 
@_date: 2014-08-17 09:25:57
I think every user should warn people about how shitty it is, if he want this of course.
@_date: 2014-09-07 12:45:49
We don't need another altcoin. What about something innovative bitcoin headline?
@_date: 2014-08-15 05:59:01
The price drops not because of good news. The price is falling because of JP Morgan Bank and bad news that he brought to our community
@_date: 2014-08-31 12:04:17
No it doesn't 
@_date: 2014-08-08 11:54:10

Bitcar for a Bitcoiners? Want it! 
@_date: 2014-08-13 08:46:10


Nothing new here. Taxation are meant to be stolen by a human. 
@_date: 2014-08-06 08:38:14
The whole article is a one huge quote. And yes, it's already posted. 
@_date: 2014-08-13 08:50:23
Since now, Bitcoin is logistically logic. Or logically logistic. Whatever
@_date: 2014-08-15 04:33:41
Two weeks until BTC price will change because of Bitcoin accepting
@_date: 2014-09-07 11:12:51

Looks like Linux team has created something cool like Bitcoin
@_date: 2014-08-13 08:51:44
Time Magazine sometimes make me laugh. Their reports sometimes have no connection with a real world.
@_date: 2014-09-07 13:07:54


Like everything nowadays. But i think it's good that members of Bitcoin community can pick the best way to act even if it "slightly tedious". 
@_date: 2014-08-04 16:01:34
Sorry for your lost if it's real of course.
@_date: 2014-08-31 12:14:53


Who are you? Captain Obvious? 
@_date: 2014-09-07 12:58:16


That's a problem of a bunch of modern people.
@_date: 2014-08-13 08:50:46
Yeah, their business is huge. Hope that they make BTC much more popular
@_date: 2014-08-31 12:12:09
Do we have a Bitcoin coca cola? 
@_date: 2014-08-17 09:23:22
I have already made my conclusions. Thank you.
@_date: 2014-08-06 08:35:43
Agree. Bad that they won't read your comment 
@_date: 2014-08-31 12:14:34
Google or googols - who care? 
@_date: 2014-08-17 14:49:23
Worthy act, Captain
@_date: 2014-08-06 08:36:22
How UK can become a Bitcoin Global Superpower? Because of what? Researching phase? 
@_date: 2014-08-13 08:48:24
To The Moon! (c'mon! Somebody should say that)
@_date: 2014-08-13 08:47:19
Lol. You are asking too much from people who are able to think and be creative. 
@_date: 2014-08-08 11:58:07
Depends how close it is I guess
@_date: 2014-08-13 08:49:01
Your words don't make any sense
@_date: 2014-08-17 09:27:20
Yeah. You do not need to take so close to heart their opinion.
@_date: 2014-09-07 12:45:51


More scandals you see - more attention you get. The more attention you get, then higher price is.
@_date: 2014-08-17 14:45:13
Must be a specific regulation with the definition of "high risk". Your guess may be incorrect.
@_date: 2014-08-15 04:30:50
The way "soonish" then just a two weeks

Yes, I never heard of it.
@_date: 2014-08-08 11:55:52
It is important to me because I would rather not a bunch of random people knowing my personal financial business.
@_date: 2014-08-13 08:48:40
Or Moon sealand
@_date: 2014-08-31 12:14:54


The government can also make a denomination reform and gogols will disapear. 
@_date: 2014-08-13 08:44:38

@_date: 2014-08-31 12:11:11
Do you know who other Bitcoin miners are? Maybe they are quite shadowy lol 
@_date: 2014-08-31 12:04:02


That' s a longest way to say "Bitcoin subreddit"

It's a regular cartoon about Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-08-31 12:11:37
Currency is not an investment but it can be used as an instrument. People say "to invest some money". 
@_date: 2014-09-07 12:45:47
From America to UK... what's next? Moon? 
@_date: 2014-08-17 14:50:21
Just stop using coindesk
@_date: 2014-08-17 14:47:34
Agree with you. If we only knew the truth about it.
@_date: 2014-08-15 04:30:30
It can't crash the price. The only organization which we should blame for today is JP Morgan Bank
@_date: 2014-08-15 05:52:35
lol, they should switch their subscription teasers into teaser-trailers
@_date: 2014-08-06 08:37:05
Or Bitpounds lol
@_date: 2014-08-13 08:48:02
