Do you know when RH is going live with crypto trading?
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:26:52
Pretty irresponsible. If you don’t have cash now what makes you think you’ll have cash later. If you don’t even have a savings account it’s hard to believe you’ll be able to come up with that money and not spend it. Just being honest.

Or it’s possible that people are accepting that cryptocurrency will be a huge part of the global economy and bitcoin is paving the way as the gold standard for crypto even if it doesn’t stick around as the primary currency.

Even if cash is kept in gdax? What if I sold btc for usd and rebought at a lower price an hour later?
@_date: 2017-12-02 18:06:57
Thanks. I’ll check it out.

If they have them all then are they really worth anything if no one else can use them?
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:19:10
You pay tax on any income, regardless of where it comes from.

Doesn’t matter. He could have easily bought bitcoin back to replace what he just spent.
@_date: 2017-12-02 17:46:11
What if that wallet paid someone else and that other person traded it at another exchange?
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:34:39
Anything anyone ever spends can be converted into bitcoin.. doesn’t matter how much he spent now - as long as he bought more to replace it.

New found money where you can take half and leave half and still be on top?
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:55:01
What if I sell bitcoin for USD but keep on an exchange and rebuy bitcoin that same day?
@_date: 2017-12-12 13:27:55
Add it next to it!
@_date: 2017-12-02 17:55:16
How does one pay taxes on bitcoin if it’s always changing in value? You wouldn’t pay taxes on a loss would you? How do you price that bitcoin payment if it was never converted back to USD? 
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:39:36
To promote bitcoin.. that’s the whole point.

Now keep track for tax season!
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:41:29
So they’ll just lose trillions of dollars they choose to hold and never use it. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:53:53
How does the tax situation work in this case? Say I trade USD to bitcoin and spend my bitcoin. Say for example I spent 3k USD to convert to bitcoin for a purchase. Now those bitcoin are gone. Can I claim this as a loss when I do my taxes? Technically they aren’t an investment and now I’m down 3kUSD.

Poor stay poor when they don’t know how to invest.

Doesn’t matter if you hodl.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:31:31
You’ll owe taxes on crypto - crypto trades too.

Can’t bitcoin be bad for the world if a few have more wealth than the top richest in the world now? There’s a few with a shitload of bitcoin that if bitcoin keeps rising will appear to be the new richest people in the world.
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:35:06
This is crazy. Is this a crypto revolution??
@_date: 2018-05-03 16:09:04
Isn’t it a bitcoin too for a full bitcoin? Similar to one dollar and one cent?
@_date: 2018-05-03 16:48:32
Sure. Though I think majority would agree that it makes sense to call it 1 bitcoin as opposed to 100,000,000 Satoshis at this point. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:20:47
Yes, and you should.

What kind of code language would be required to work on software?
