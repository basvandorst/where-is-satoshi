Back up what? I’m citing events that have taken place in the past and comparing it to now 
@_date: 2018-05-18 16:35:40
Nice contradiction of yourself 
@_date: 2018-05-18 01:49:17
Sources? Don’t need any just look at the past consensus dates and then look at the fuckin bitcoin chart. No sources needed!
@_date: 2018-05-26 14:56:31
Why do you hate BCash so much it just tripled in a month from $600 to $1800 before the dip, those returns are better then what bitcoin will get you all year
@_date: 2018-05-17 22:21:42
Defend 8k!!
@_date: 2018-05-18 23:22:20
Fuck Bart
@_date: 2018-05-18 16:54:51
That’s because your getting your shorts squeezed 
@_date: 2018-05-17 22:31:41
Hey bud, every consensus boost has happened at lease a week afterwards.  Same thing for tax day, this dip is to get weak hands out before the surge
@_date: 2018-05-17 23:50:18
Every weak hand out there is a sensitive panic baby that comes on here and spews there negativity.  I’m not exactly saying negative feelings=weak hands
@_date: 2018-05-26 19:38:15
Look buddy, I don’t give a fuck about your nodes and blocks.  Keep worshipping your bitcoin and small gains while I’m making maximum profit 
@_date: 2018-05-17 23:31:06
Buy buy buy hodl hodl hodl
@_date: 2018-05-18 01:37:01
Same circumstance as tax day, everyone expects an immediate boom. Give it a few days;)
@_date: 2018-05-18 16:41:00
And here comes Superman.... defending all the depressed sellers.  I don’t give a fuck what they do with there money it’s just ridiculous how many panic babies are in this market
@_date: 2018-05-17 22:44:36
Everyone needs to get there negative feelings out of this discussion nobody likes weak hands
@_date: 2018-05-26 19:51:48
Sorry man, I didn’t know this was English class.
@_date: 2018-05-18 17:03:12
This thing can bang any moment all it takes is a few whales and we’re back above 9k;)
@_date: 2018-05-18 16:21:24
Can’t stand all the idiots that sell because it doesn’t boom while the consensus is happening fuckin idiots a whales not gonna do what you expect
@_date: 2018-05-18 23:22:39
Looks like most of the weak hands are out let’s get this goin!
@_date: 2018-05-26 15:16:53
Still got some btc though just making a point the Bcash isn’t Btrash 
@_date: 2018-05-18 00:29:37
@_date: 2018-05-20 20:41:38
I don’t even think this is a short squeeze, when you look at the Bitfinex short chart shorts have actually gone up a bit.
@_date: 2018-05-18 16:57:45
Don’t worry they’ll sell low and buy back high��
@_date: 2018-05-18 01:02:23
Thanks 
@_date: 2018-05-10 11:45:03
Low volume? Half the world ain’t awake yet.
@_date: 2018-05-18 00:30:24
@_date: 2018-05-18 00:32:06
It’s a fags natural tendency to sell low buy high
@_date: 2018-05-18 19:28:50
Yeah fuck you and your shorts 
@_date: 2018-05-17 22:43:08
Exactly 
@_date: 2018-05-18 19:29:06
Fuck Bart Simpson

I’m sayin Binance facing regulations shouldn’t tank the market, I’m actually holding through this , I really couldn’t care less about Binance I use Coinbase 
@_date: 2018-03-17 20:34:07
Yep, whales never miss an opportunity when everyone’s drunk 
@_date: 2018-03-22 14:20:57
It’s ridiculous, one exchange shouldn’t fuck with our money, screw Binance who gives a shit it’s their own damn fault
