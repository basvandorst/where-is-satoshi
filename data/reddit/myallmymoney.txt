I let my son do it through an exchange. I'm not good enough with computers to do these things myself. Especially back then it was way too difficult for me to understand it all.

Sadly enough i will be forced to sell soon. Putting all this money in something that became worth less every day started a snowball effect of loans and debt. Because i was losing money i thought i would always have i got into trouble. Everything just went wrong and more wrong. 
I am about to lose my house if i don't pay a lot soon. So i will be forced to sell at a gigantic loss.

Yes, i should've said that differently. Can't blame Bitcoin.

Bitcoin destroyed my life. I went all in at around $1000 with pretty much my whole life savings. 
I didn't know much about Bitcoin and just like you i started reading here. Every day i read about how it was guaranteed to go to the moon and all these people getting rich overnight. 
I asked many people if i still should get in at 1000 and got the same answer from everyone: 1000 is cheap. We will be at 10k soon. 
I bought around 85k in coins. This was what i saved for nearly 30 years through hard work and was to go to my retirement. 
Well everyone can imagine how well that went. 
Worst of all i still didn't sell because again everyone was saying this is just a small correction so i was afraid to sell. I expected the price to go up again. 900, 700, 500, 350. 
My life has completely changed. I'm 64 now, near retirement and lost most of my money i worked my whole life for. I'm soon forced to sell at these low prices or i will lose my house. I won't bother you with the rest. Believe me, it's not pretty. 
I'm also not here for pity. I only blame myself. Just wanted to show a different kind of story "thanks" to this sub reddit.

Yes and i was a fool. I brainwashed myself. There were also people telling me not to invest too much but i ignored it. So many other people were just repeating how we would go to 10.000. I completely lost myself in it. I couldn't imagine all those people being wrong. 
I just hope those same people didn't make the same mistake.

You are completely right. 
To make things more positive though after investing i really started to learn and appreciate Bitcoin as a technology.

Thanks. Feels great to hear that from the same people who told me to invest. 
Again, i'm not here for pity but i don't think i deserve any abuse. 
Anyway, if it really makes you feel better go ahead. I'm not a hateful person.
