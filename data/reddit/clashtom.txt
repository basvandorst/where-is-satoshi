I paid 1.49% using coinbase with a us checking acct(ally banking)
So for 198 usd worth of btc i paid 2.80 for currency fee.

 i keep trying iran petrodollar announcement on google all news is from last month but somebody on reddit 2-3 weeks ago listed a bunch of world events, one was also march 15th fed rate increase

To me that is a huge amount of money, so dont take advice so lightly from me or others til you think about it over for a while. Obviously you are smart enough to use reddit and have sensible financial responsibilities. 
Investing in bitcoin at the moment would be a bit risky considering march 11th/13th deadline etf coming up. Who knows how that will play into bitcoin. So if those funds could become liquid in 1-2 days it would be worth it to buy when it drops below 1200 a coin.

Its hard to avoid currency transfer fees, but finding a bank that charges the least for these fees would be the best option. I know ally bank charges 1.49% per transaction

The projections are just shots in the dark. One thing you could weigh in for the strength for the future is the amount of merchants that would be accepting bitcoin

Keep holding and keep buying. :)

Its a media outlet owned by top 6 media corps. Anything they write will be biased towards their agenda.

Forbes so biased.. no bueno.

Try to find sites that arent associated with msm. Forbes and other related sites are super biased towards bc.
