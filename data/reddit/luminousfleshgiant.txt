I haven't downloaded yet, but one thing that drives me insane about most apps is that when you "sell" an asset, it has to be to fiat. There's no way to track trades between assets. Is this supported by your app or planned for the future?

Interesting that if those people had stuck it out, they'd be absolutely loaded right now.

In Canada our cards have chips and NFC is also widely available for credit and debit payments already.

What's to stop you from adding in your own entries and "drawing" them as the winner?

When my relatives started asking about BTC last December, I knew I should sell.. But I had promised myself I wouldn't touch it until 2023 and I chose to stick it out. This year has been rough.

Out of curiosity, where did you hear about the ETH presale?
Also, don't lose hope. I had lost the password to a LTC wallet 2 years ago. One day, I just remembered it.

I got everything setup to buy $200 worth at $0.70. Then I didn't.

What site is this from?

I have also successfully withdrawn all my BTC.

I did the exact same thing... That was about the 3rd or 4th time I ended up being lazy after hearing about bitcoins.. I recall downloading the first release of the bitcoin client and deciding it was a waste to bother mining for something with so little gain... I was too lazy to run a damn program.. and if I had, I'd be loaded right about now.

That is exactly what I thought.. I recall hearing about bitcoins shortly after the first public release. Downloaded and mined a little bit, but thought it was a fad and not worth the effort... Power is included in my rent, had I simply ran a program for the past few years, I'd be loaded. Aw well..

It is logical for them to be. They have the resources to perform a distributed ddos and have a direct financial incentive to.

There were also people running botnet who would have been mining more than this in a day if they got in early enough. 
@_date: 2013-04-22 19:52:40
I wouldn't say that's "most likely". Bitcoin mining attracts botnet owners. Therefore, there are people interested in Bitcoin with access to the resources to perform ddos attacks. 
@_date: 2013-04-22 19:54:23
Those in control if botnets hold a massive share of Bitcoin. Who do you think those top miners on the mining groups are? Botnet owners.

It really wouldn't be hard for a motivated government to buy out market control. I really hope that doesn't happen, but don't be naive. If a government wants it to die at this stage, they can kill it. Another might pop up in its place, but people need reliability in a currency for it to truly go mainstream.

He could be an early adopter, or better yet, he could be an early adopter who ran a botnet. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 23:13:40
That would crash the market. I'd bet he's cashed out enough for a lifetime of comfortable living. No reason to cash out the rest, especially when it's jumping in value so quickly.
