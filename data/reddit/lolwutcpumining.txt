Cool I'll keep that in mind as I poke around, thanks!

Can you tell me if it is still possible to run CGMiner to CPU mine, and if so, with a pool? That has literally been my only question this entire time and is still unanswered.

Really? Building a 6 box, energy wasting, cpu hashing monstrosity seems like I could learn plenty or at least have a good time tinkering. How the fuck is there no hobby aspect to that?

Not so much. Actually, what I'm doing is exactly the equivalent of saying, "I have a bunch of spare motherboards and PSUs and electricity is free for me. Also, even though this will literally never be worth my time to spend setting it up I could enjoy a fun side project if somebody could just let me know if it's possible."
Too bad every response so far on this wonderful forum, and to every similar question on other wonderful bitcoin community forums, has completely ignored the original question or been condescending.

The fun would be in building, organizing, and configuring the miners. I just don't want to bother if it's an impossible task. Unfortunately that's the million dollar question that nobody has any fucking idea how to answer around here.

I already did from people who came in and were able to not only read my post, but also answer my question and not be a dickhead. Those people I was quite polite to. My patience is in short supply for people like you, who fail miserably on all three counts.

Cool, none of that actually costs me anything so I'm not too worried about it. Thanks for the info though.

Thanks a ton for all you posts here, directly to me and otherwise!

I saw that, the response was 3 years old so that's not necessarily applicable anymore. I don't see how asking a quick question of whether something is possible is draining support resources, what the fuck is wrong with you?


That was in the original post but I guess you're a dense one aren't you?
@_date: 2016-06-28 12:56:01
Ok so you forgot what a hobby is? That must be it.
@_date: 2016-06-28 17:48:58
Cool thanks a ton!
