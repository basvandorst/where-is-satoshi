If you ACTUALLY thought the price of bitcoin was falling you would spend/sell. You however are still convinced that the price will go up later and you are simply a temporarily embarrassed millionaire. So of course you won't spend now and sell your moon tickets, the exact deflationary spiral that people warn of.

That really only works because you never really need to spend bitcoin ever. In a real economy it's really not easy to plan in advance exactly how much money you need every day and to need to go all the way home to get more if you estimate wrong.

1) fails to impress people because most people in the US send money to individuals outside their country between 0 and 3 times in their entire lives and most people in europe can do it freely. 
2) fails because the people that deal with a lot of overdraft fees still won't have any money and just are broke now in bitcoin instead of dollars. 
3) is a non issue that no one has ever had problems with ever to even need to look at a solution.

It's hilarious how desperate bitcoin is to assign bitcoin "Inherent value". It's like they are a bunch of kids that hear the word value and think bitcoin has to have that, and ignore the fact that the whole point of money is that it's the definition of external assigned value and currency is supposed to be as far away from inherent value as is reasonable.

What risk? The people that would get richest just ran a program on their computer for a while or bought when the price was a few dollars. The steps from there is "just don't lose the paper you wrote the key down on". That is the total sum of the risk.

How much of a troll I am really has no bearings on if buying exact amounts of bitcoin to spend on exact transactions is a good idea. It isn't. If the price drops even a nickel per bitcoin 0.1055 will no longer be 50 dollars exactly and 49.9999 won't be enough.

It's like the almost exact opposite of the book. 
@_date: 2014-10-03 23:00:02
I think you are misunderstanding what the blockchain does if you think it literally means the files can't be altered. A bug could fuck up the files all it wanted. They wouldn't validate after the program would reject them. But satoshi's great magic doesn't alter the file system on your computer so you can't fuck up or delete the files.

@_date: 2014-12-17 15:30:22
Anything above 50% is the exact point where you succeed at 100%. Once you control most of the network you can always make the longest blockchain and push out every one else's blocks. 
As for 'more profitable', that is based on the assumption the only way to profit is to make bitcoin prices go up, which is not the case.

Yeah, it turns out that downloading every transaction in history was a really dumb way to set up a currency.

That still sounds like an awful simple attack vector. The blockchain is cumulative and forever, so if you can't force in one 100 GB block you can still do the same damage with forcing 100 one GB blocks, or 1000 one hundred megabyte junk blocks. 
If you could get 5% of the network hash you could get 1000 blocks in 4 and a half months. 
Change the numbers as you see fit, it makes it very simple to bloat the block chain endlessly even with small hash percentages.

Getting a time stamp of a hash of a text file seems like it solves like .0001% of the issues involved in copyright.
Actually the blockchain isn't even good for that. Since you can see transactions before they are in blocks, and someone could just grab the hash, and make their own transaction before a block is formed and then both people have a hash of the paper and a blockchain 'proof' showing they did it at the exact same time. Actually if the person was lucky enough they could pay a higher fee and maybe get in a block earlier. Stealing every copyright. No possible way to know who was actually the original author and who just was copying hashes into new transactions.

The way you make money with bitcoin is selling it for more than you bought it for and the next person selling it for more than he bought it for.

You can however hack the computers that store bitcoin, such as the exchanges and web wallets. (also bitcoin itself has been hacked several times including lesser things like transaction malleability and forking the blockchain and giant earlier things like spending money out of other people's wallets and printing yourself 184 billion bitcoin). 
So really whatever technicality of what you count as truely hacking bitcoin barely matters to nearly anyone. When someone loses 70,000 dollars they aren't going to feel better when you explain that it was just them and not technically bitcoin that got hacked.

The tax consequences of bitcoin are because people (hope) to make money. That money is taxed. You buy it at 100, tomorrow you sell it at 1000 and you owe taxes on that 900 dollars you made.

The money making system for bitcoin is "buy a thing", "wait a while", "sell the exact same thing for more".
That quickly becomes a logical dead end. So fresh blood has to come in, more and more people in each layer of the pyramid. 
In this way the fantasy of getting rich needs to come with the fantasy of millions of people in the pyramid below. That to keep reselling the same object for more and more money that more and more people need to sacrifice their wealth to enrich the people higher up. 
For the people that got in late, and are now bagholders they realize their fantasy requires millions or billions of people to sacrifice their money to make all the people at that level rich.  And so fantasize about when millions and billions people fight over their .05 bitcoins they have and how they can sell that for 8 million dollars.

Unless you are paid in bitcoin originally or something bitcoin doesn't hide money very well, your bank records are still going to show all your money disappearing either to coinbase or to cash to buy on localbitcoins. It's not some super inventive strategy to empty your bank account when you owe money then claim 'it all went away!' and it'd actually probobly be easier to physically hide the cash somewhere instead of creating all the extra steps of making it into bitcoin.

Larger does not equal more stable. Gold has a multi-trillion dollar cap and has been traded around for tens of thousands of years but still varies as much as 100% over a few years.

Bitcoin is 351 at one place, 350 at two other places and 344 at a fourth. Which makes an average price of 477 dollars, this average has gone down 1% since today but up in the last 24 hours.

Basically it's a thing you buy then sell to someone else for more money, then they sell it to a third person for more money, forever and ever, and this can only work as long as you keep bringing new people in (or getting people already in to double down on their investment) and this requires constant recruitment.

The thing is, everyone thinks they should have bought in early and sold at peak, but the truth is if everyone was doing that it wouldn't actually have gone up. 
It's like the way comic books from the 40s were worth millions so in the 90s everyone started buying 8 copies and holding them sure they'd be millionaires. Now all of the 90s comics are worth less than the cover price. The reason the price peaked so bad is BECAUSE so few people had stashes of bitcoins.

Remittance is hard when neither party has a bank account, it's expensive if one side has a bank account. It's easy and reasonably priced if two people have bank accounts.

Not a whole full blown wallet but Peter Todd made a set of double spend scripts that would work with virtually 100% success rates based on pre version .9 nodes having a different definition of minimum transaction fees than post .9 nodes. 
The number of .8 something nodes out there is still quite high so there is no real reason this wouldn't still work. Someone could absolutely work it into a gui if they wanted. 
Generally this fact is downplayed as much as possible because bitcoin becomes a lot harder when you can't pretend zero confirmations are fine.

That sure sounds like a thing wedbush would say this week after the other news that came out this week. 
Wall Street's self-funded regulator on Monday charged brokerage firm Wedbush Securities with having shoddy risk controls, a flaw that in turn allowed thousands of traders to flood U.S. markets and execute manipulative trades.
The Financial Industry Regulatory Authority's case marks the second time this year that regulators have filed civil charges against the major brokerage firm over so-called market access rule violations.
Earlier this summer, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission filed a related against Wedbush; its former vice president, Jeffrey Bell; and its current senior vice president, Christina Fillhart.
In FINRA's complaint on Monday, the regulator accuses Los Angeles-based Wedbush of having "egregious and systemic anti-money laundering supervisory violations" that occurred between January 2008 and August 2013.
Read MoreSEC to examine alternative mutual funds
Under FINRA's rules, the firm can now file a response to the charges and request a hearing before a disciplinary panel. Possible remedies may include a fine, censure, suspension or bar from the industry, and an order to pay back ill-gotten gains.
Matthew Chisum, a spokesman for Wedbush, could not be immediately reached for comment on the latest complaint.
The SEC matter, meanwhile, is slated to be heard before an SEC administrative law judge, with pre-hearing briefs due by the end of September.
Wedbush has denied the SEC's charges, saying its controls were "reasonably designed to achieve compliance" with federal market access rules.
Market access rules were put in place in 2010 by the SEC as one of the responses to the "flash crash" that year in which the Dow Jones Industrial Average plunged sharply by about 700 points before sharply rebounding. They require brokerages that provide customers with direct access to the market to have reasonable controls in place.
The first brokerage to ever face charges for violating the rules was Knight Capital, now called KCG Holdings, which paid $12 million in a 2013 settlement.
Wedbush, which is one of the largest firms by trading volume on the Nasdaq stock exchange, became the second firm to face charges over market access rules by the SEC in June.
That marked the first time the SEC had ever sued Wedbush. However, the firm has a very long regulatory disciplinary history with FINRA that stretches back decades.

I've found that relationship with economics leans more toward generally uninformed than recently reformed, but that's besides the point. I'm curious to find out what law of economics Bitcoin has re-written. Tell me.
When you talk about hoarding, you seem to equate "what's good for bitcoin" to "people's self-interest". Short term thinkers are bad for most economies, not just Bitcoin.
Hoarding DOES lead to deflation, which leads to more hoarding. Rising prices DON'T encourage merchants to adopt Bitcoin, since no one is willing to spend coins on any goods. The volatility (although upwards) forces any merchants that DO adopt to hardwire BTC to a stable currency.
Once the the market is saturated with hoarders and prices plateau, the incentive to hoard is gone. People will either
cash out
spend their bitcoins with the few retailers that'll take them, then they'll cash out.
Both of these options will cause BTC to plummet. If speculators still rule the market, you can rinse and repeat. Only when speculators move onto the next bubble will we see stabilization.
So yes: self interest is not only natural, but also primal. But you can't get mad at people for wanting investors who can see the big picture and for rejecting those who have wet dreams about bitcoinity.org hitting an all time high.
Price should follow adoption, not the other way around.

Note: this is how you gain it now, most people trying to sell it to you gained it by leaving a program running for a few days on a computer that was good at videogames.

The idea of not paying taxes by trading your money for some sort of token isn't new or uncommon. It's more that a huge percent of bitcoiners are also tax protesters.

Nothing in the code. Also the claims go against all known economics and is just based on some weird made up bitcoin economics that makes no real sense. Money only stabilizes in price if someone intentionally stabilizes it. Gold, corn, tin, whatever all vary 100% in price over a few years.

The "in theory" answer is that once all the coins are mined transaction fees will cover paying the miners. 
In reality that is extremely hand wavey since transaction fees make up .27% of the income a miner makes right now. Meaning they could rise to be 100 times as big and only cover less than a third of what miners are being paid now.

The whole point of bitcoin was to solve the issue of double spending using a blockchain, it is hilarious that the last 6 years after that has been the community trying to sell the idea that you didn't actually need that at all and it's fine to just skip that part. 
Also, again, lots of things cost more than 400 dollars. People can spend more than 400 dollars in groceries sometimes. Are they simply going to stand around for up to an hour waiting for a confirmation? What if they get it and then it orphans? Since about 5% of blocks orphan per day.

What force will magically stabilize it? Why will it stabilize? Hamburgers was actually a funny example because the price of hamburger is twice what it was a year ago even though beef has hundreds of millions of users and is tens of thousands of years old. Currencies would flop around wildly if there was not huge amounts of effort in preventing that from happening. Bitcoin isn't going to cross some magic line someday where it magically stabilizes magically for no reason.

People in this thread will lie to you and tell you that bitcoin will eventually stabilize if it gets some vague special amount of "big" but that makes no sense. No traded commodity stabilizes. The only reason real world currencies stabilize even as much as they do is because governments work to intentionally keep it stable. 
A mcdonalds hamburger costs a dollar today and a dollar tomorrow and a dollar next year because of the whole complex system of the federal reserve printing money and changing interest rates and changing the return on government bonds, not because we got to some critical mass where we printed enough dollar bills and magically the price stabilized.

Vice, being the slick entity it is, undertook a 20-minute documentary published today to answer the question, “What the hell is up with this Soylent stuff?” Reporter Brian Merchant went on a Soylent diet for 30 days, after traveling out to film the warehouse where Soylent founder Rob Rhinehart was making the initial beta batch of products. What he found — rats, mold, and some questionable practices — may wind up cooling the Soylent fervor.
Like any good startup, the company had rented out a cheap warehouse space in Oakland to get the venture off the ground. Unlike other startups however, the founders of Soylent were making food, not software, and the dusty, empty warehouse space was perhaps not the most hygienic of kitchens.
During the documentary, the Motherboard cameras catch a rat scurrying around the food supply boxes. “We were not poking around, we were not trying to do gotcha journalism, we had just set up the cameras to run the interview,” Merchant says. They didn’t even know they had shot the rat till they were reviewing the footage in the hotel the next night. Not great timing, given that Merchant had just started his 30-day Soylent diet, and the back of the car was filled with Soylent packets he had taken straight from the warehouse floors. “I was definitely worried,” Merchant says. “Seeing this, it’s right there next to their mixing station. It was right next to the supply.”
Aside from just the rat, viewers will probably be appalled by the warehouse conditions. Workers are mixing piles and piles of flour-y soylent in big bins, with only plastic sheets separating the mixing rooms from the rest of the otherwise dusty warehouse.
If that’s not enough to turn off potential Soylent customers, the mold scene might do it. Merchant returns home to New York City and films himself going on the Soylent diet. During the second week he receives a shipment of moldy Soylent. Since he had vowed to eat only Soylent for a month and that shipment was all he had, he scooped out the mold and drank what was left. “We think what happened is when it was shipped the bag got punctured and some moisture got in there,” Merchant says. “It’s illustrative that they’re thinking of the experiment first and foremost and the sanitary conditions second.”
Beta testing doesn’t really work with food. Faulty trials won’t work either. Winging it, and worrying about regulations later is also not a good idea. With food, you can’t ship an update if there’s bugs. If there’s literal bugs, it’s likely people will wind up with food poisoning. As Merchant says, “Do I want the Uber guy to disrupt the frozen peas? I don’t know.”

Take my opinion with a grain of salt but I feel like it's pretty clear many people don't give 'tips' in an effort to actually give the person something, they just give it to try to make an ad for bitcoin, and in that framework it doesn't really matter if the guy gets to keep it, it just matters that it makes some big stupid comment chain in random threads.

Also "7" is a number based on a sort of transaction that is not the actual sort of transaction that actually happens.

Bitcoin is the extra middle man, with bitcoin you need to use bitcoin THEN a separate service to get these wacky "pieces of paper" most people call money. WU both moves the number in a database AND gives you paper, bitcoin moves a number in a database then says "eh, find someone to trade you for paper"

You are correct, that is why even after 6 entire years bitcoin has less users than the number of people that bought "the maze runner" on dvd or blu ray this week. Very little is ever going to happen through bitcoin or the blockchain. It's simply not a practical currency at any sort of scale.

3 transactions per second maximum is pretty dumb (I know everyone uncritically accepts 7 as the max transactions but it's pretty easy to go and look at the actual average transaction size and see that 1mb/that size doesn't equal 7 but instead equals around 2.9). 
The "it's so simple! we just raise the block cap!" becomes so much less convincing when this "simple" solution has failed to happen for over half a decade now.

10. Privacy
The traditional banking model achieves a level of privacy by limiting access to information to the
parties involved and the trusted third party. The necessity to announce all transactions publicly
precludes this method, but privacy can still be maintained by breaking the flow of information in
another place: by keeping public keys anonymous. The public can see that someone is sending
an amount to someone else, but without information linking the transaction to anyone. This is
similar to the level of information released by stock exchanges, where the time and size of
individual trades, the "tape", is made public, but without telling who the parties were.
As an additional firewall, a new key pair should be used for each transaction to keep them
from being linked to a common owner. Some linking is still unavoidable with multi-input
transactions, which necessarily reveal that their inputs were owned by the same owner. The risk
is that if the owner of a key is revealed, linking could reveal other transactions that belonged to
the same owner.

People quote 7 transactions per second as the theoretical maximum, but looking at the actual transactions on the actual blockchain it's easy to calculate that using the average size of actual transactions that only about 3per second can be added to the blockchain. 
The redskin's stadium seats 85,000 people so to process just their tickets the blockchain would require 28333 seconds, or about 7 hours and 45 minutes. To process one single game (if everyone else on earth stopped using bitcoin during that time).

Like 200,000 people own all the bitcoin that exist. Which is about 60% of all the bitcoin that could ever exist. With one dude owning 10% of the bitcoin. 
The bitcoin economy is fucked and being voluntary there is very little chance many more people will ever voluntarily join a system like that. !% owning 50% of the wealth was bad enough. .005% of the population owning 100% of the wealth is just not a thing anyone is going to go for.

Ignoring long term pie in the sky stuff where bitcoin will revolutionize the world and generate value that way bitcoin is currently extremely zero sum. Any person getting richer means other people getting poorer. Bitcoin isn't a magic machine where everyone can get richer. The best hope is to have all the current people get richer by bringing in new people to get poorer (who if lucky could then be the next group of people that need new newer people to get rich off).

Well I mean, the blockchain was supposed to be the solution to the longstanding issue of double spending digital currency.

@_date: 2015-02-09 18:32:10
I mean the whole existence of bitcoin is based on how hard it was to prevent double spending. If there was some secret better solution you could just not have bitcoin at all. The solution satoshi came up with was mined blocks and waiting for confirmation of mining. Skipping that can be okay if social pressures such as a lady making sure you aren't buying 400 fake coffee transactions in a row but on something that sells near instantly and automatically? No way.

100mb could support 280 transactions per second if transactions stay the size they are now. With 700 per second as some perfect ideal maximum. 
To get 1000 you need 350mb blocks, or about a .5TB a day. Visa can handle 24000 a second so to get to that you need 12TB a day.

This is how financial services for grown ups work.

It is very telling that people have given up seeing actual value in bitcoin and now talk about "bubbles" at all, like even bitcoiners know bitcoin isn't worth 1000, they just hope that it can be pumped up to that before popping. (somehow, by someone)

r/Bitcoin is full of people that simultaneously think central bankers rule everything and control the money supply with an iron fist using their regulation and financial policy to control flows of wealth but at the exact same time the only reason the dollar is so stable is because "it's big"

In a future where you have magic nanobots that can create anything and cost less than a dollar bill what the fuck do you need money for? The magic nanobots would be the currency if anything.

Even saying this will invoke every single austrian in the area but inflation in currency is a good thing. Currency is a really dumb place to hold money long term. It has no advantage to society and there is a good reason to disincentivize it and get people to actually DO THINGS with their money.

Why would the exit of everyone from the market except "hardcore bitcoiners" be a good sign for the price? I mean I have often stated that the long term future is a dead market inhabited only by crazy people that trade satoshis at a dollar a piece with each other so they can brag to each other that they are billionares with no way to realize that wealth but I find surprise in people celebrating the ecosystem drying out in that way.

A system where you let other people pick what is stored on your computer is a dramatically bad idea.

Not many people are anarchists. Most people are pretty okay with laws existing and consumer protections and get angry when powers are misused but don't really hate the concept of there being monetary policy. Like most people if you ask them "should people be able to send money to isis" will say no, that is fine to stop, even if that also means that the same ability could potentially be used to stop people from sending money to wikileaks or something some people like.

Like a stock split but eventually half of the stock will get thrown away and be useless and you can't know which ones and when you trade with people they can't know if they are trading the right ones or not.

It's like a bank ledger that anyone can write on, but you have to guess the number first and if you guess right everyone agrees to let you write that you got 25 points you can write on the ledger.

FUD! Why would a stoshi include a bug in his perfect design? Bitcoin can not be hacked!

What kind of charity has any issues at all with chargeback? What would even be the point of someone doing that?  It has little impact on the charity and zero benefit for the person doing it.

Bitcoin can't send dollars at all. It can only sell bitcoin. Which you may or may not be able to sell to someone for dollars. 
@_date: 2015-02-03 13:40:47
Bitcoin is hashcash and e-money. The white paper even cites that it's just based off that stuff.

That link explains that your plan misunderstands public key encryption. 
@_date: 2015-02-03 14:53:26
Might but won't. Bitcoin is basically full of people that are unable to back out of bad ideas when it becomes apparent the idea is bad. 
@_date: 2015-02-09 11:47:46
There is hundreds of blockchains that are not Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-02-19 05:09:52
So no one lost any money on Enron stocks because they can't ever sell?
@_date: 2015-02-15 13:02:18
You sound like someone who missed selling your Bitcoin at the highest it will ever be.
@_date: 2015-02-09 21:10:14
None of those do anything to address the fact it'd be 12TB a day just to match one of the card processors. 
@_date: 2015-02-25 01:25:41
Rad, so basically development has gone to be beyond closed door by a few people that singlehandedly run bitcoin.
