Disagree completely.  ETH has tremendous value and is potentially undervalued.  It's not a BTC vs ETH thing.  Both are winners.

I'm just talking about how the math works out today.  Yes, difficulty will go up.  Always does..right?
The price I was quoted includes the PSU.
So what you are saying is my math checks out aside from the fact that things will change in a non-predictable way over time.

So you're a fan?  Does my math check out?

You are warning me that my math is wrong, but you haven't been able to point out how -or- what the right math is.  If there is an error in my calculation, what is it?

How is this math certainly wrong?

Electricity is about $70 / month for 1 unit.  Profit around $1k.  I don't follow the thinking.
Also, I'm much older, have a career...family, etc.  I'm still a teenager in my parents basement when everyone goes to bed at night though.  :)

15.0 GH/s
1200 w power
Return Per Month
$ 1,001.85
Cost of unit
$2100 (lowest I saw)
So just over 2 months.  How is the math wrong on this?
