The real question is who the hell wants to store 150gb just to use a wallet??
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:41:47
Ah I must have misunderstood, so I can use the core wallet without downloading 150gb?

@_date: 2017-12-01 01:14:52
OK, so nothing is stopping it over this side. I guess we should all be clamouring for the best bot, and that'll be Bitcoin..
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:08:16
I see! When I got into bitcoin two years ago I was casually using core as a desktop wallet, but times have changed. Thanks for the explanation.
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:28:14
I've a better idea, how about we all cash out and use a coin that's actually built to scale! Heh heh
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:39:45
wait, in what universe does 4,894.833 BTC equal $10,000?
@_date: 2017-12-01 01:26:02
I see, fair point. It doesn't seem too optimistic however, it seems in the long run, humans will be in a losing game. Your point seems to indicate it will be a 'get in, hold, get out' bubble type investment, rather than what I would have romantically hoped when I first found it, which would have been a fair global currency of some sort.

ah yes Satoshi's younger richer brother.
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:52:11
not only slow, transactions are getting expensive too.
@_date: 2017-12-01 01:31:09
Right, so hope is not all lost, yet.. Multiple sources of info is our only hope I suppose. Making money trading CC seems to me like a very complex math problem which requires a computer to do it efficiently. I don't see how the entire system isn't gravitating entirely towards that. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:23:55
I see. 1. Why include both? 2. Does the special bc1 address change anything for the person sending the coins?
@_date: 2017-12-24 03:23:53
Yeah like srsly there should be virtually no fees ever, that was the dream, some alt is gona nail it.
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:20:44
Why did tpb recently put up two Bitcoin donation addresses, one segwit one not, why include the non one at all?
@_date: 2017-12-01 02:43:38
Related: Speaking of Exodus which I recently installed; forgive my ignorance but why is my Bitcoin leaking?? With only some BTC present in my portfolio, I clicked my balance in the top left to show overall balance in BTC instead of US dollars, and it is fluctuating up and down.. The US dollar amount should fluctuate due to changes in the value of BTC but why should my BTC balance fluctuate?? I thought Exodus was a desktop bitcoin wallet where I could hold my bitcoin statically.

We're beyond the moon, we're slowing our clocks in hyper speed right now.

Surely the best bots won't be available to the public, what's stopping a pyramid of bots seeping money up to the very few? It seems like an exponential inevitability.
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:32:01
Btc isn't out of the woods just yet, the fees are expensive and slow and it's not consumer friendly. Until these are fixed, a few nerdy investors will keep hodling and it won't reach the moon.
@_date: 2014-02-02 17:29:23
There we go! Thanks btcnr!
@_date: 2014-02-02 17:22:57
It reads "Online" in the bottom left corner of the interface. Thanks anyway.

Are counterfeit £1 coins really a problem?!
@_date: 2014-02-02 18:00:57
Ok, I see. You're right. I just needed to reset the blockchain in Multibit.
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:02:30
Ye, Exodus was what I was looking for, thanks!
edit: turns out maybe it's not so great.. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:37:20
This the one?
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:35:28
tried installing before but wouldnt work, it must be beyond osx 10.9.5

Whats the handiest way to get notified for dips without having to check it all the time? Anything good for Mac or iOS?
@_date: 2015-03-21 01:12:47
Hi! Is there somewhere I can check out your gear?
@_date: 2015-03-21 01:49:06
Please do, I'm interested!
