I still can't decide on a software wallet that can hold at least BTC, ETH, and LTC. I hear Exodus isn't trustworthy. I'll be ordering a hardware, but that takes time.
WTF do I do? Do I really need a dedicated wallet for each alt coin? It seems like quite a burden to have more than 1 wallet for the main 3??

This is true, though it does still seem like quite a pain.
Any thoughts on wallets? I plan to get a ledger or trezor, but shipping takes a bit. 
Is a multisig like Electrum or Armory reasonably secure to use in the meantime while doing small learning trades?

I plan to use android. but want something that can also handle eth and ltc at least. i plan to buy alts but don't mind setting up other wallets and/or waiting for the hardware.

high fees, not open sourced, etc

What if one is looking to get into alt coins? It seems like few have support. BitFinex, Kraken, bittrex, poloniex, binance, there's so many. 
Lately I've heard Bittrex is getting sketchy and not allowing new accounts etc. That's enough to keep me away from that. But how the heck do you choose the others?

So if you see the market crashing, and you want to get your money out, you'd have to convert to ETH/BTC and transfer them over to something like Coinbase to sell  the ETH for USD/EUR etc, and then transfer to your bank?
Man that seems convoluted. Hard to get out quick.

interesting option thanks!
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:02:37
Yes, will do. Just have to wait for shipping. I figure in the meantime I'll use small amounts of money to get used to trading crypto and learning, but still want a secure way to do so.

thanks, i'm leaning that way.

do you have any opinion on a SW wallet to use?
edit* didn't notice you are the one who suggested jaxx lol

Thanks! I'll check it out.
Do they have a good mobile app?
@_date: 2017-12-27 13:11:34
Thanks for the responses! I will check out the Trezor T and use software in the meantime.

I was planning to use ETH for that mostly. Is that a god idea?
