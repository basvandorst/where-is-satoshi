I’d like to integrate with bitcoin for my app. I wish there was something for python. I guess time to learn C
@_date: 2018-06-25 13:48:48
I feel like a old man. I remember the switch as well. 
@_date: 2018-06-24 18:40:27
Perfect sir. However I wonder what the process will involve since I may not even have access to the dummy email account I used. Yikes! 
@_date: 2018-06-16 11:04:02
No need for all that follow directions have printer ready
@_date: 2018-06-16 15:04:43
Shit man good point. I didn’t even see that. OP read carefully.
@_date: 2018-06-22 13:13:47
I’ve been reading the rsk whitepaper. 
@_date: 2018-06-24 18:17:12
How? I thought the chance was gone
@_date: 2018-06-21 13:28:50
I want to learn how to make apps on the btc blockchain, any guides out there? I am only finding development for solidity. 
@_date: 2019-08-06 21:08:31
I had to take on the debt for medical expenses so my likelihood of re racking debt is low. What do you think about that?
@_date: 2018-06-15 17:58:41
Paper wallet 
@_date: 2018-06-23 21:10:07
Absolutely thank you so much. I really want to develop on the btc blockchain more than ethereum. 
@_date: 2018-06-21 15:03:25
Thank you. Do you think it will ever be turing complete? If I can’t use btc blockchain what’s the point then? Sorry noob question 
@_date: 2019-08-07 04:16:51
Haha thanks
@_date: 2019-08-07 04:15:23
Now this is some cool stuff!
@_date: 2019-08-06 23:04:50
Do you have particular documentation I can look into this with?
@_date: 2019-08-07 04:19:19
I am confused how would calculate cost basis with DCA.
@_date: 2019-08-07 04:16:04
I can finish all debt off in 6mos if I focus all funds without and probably close to a year with DCA.
@_date: 2019-08-06 21:07:33
I totally get the feeling and that’s the same sentiment, and I’ve been buying for years as well but small amounts
@_date: 2018-06-21 16:26:26
Excellent thank you, I will check it out. 
@_date: 2018-06-24 18:42:13
Thank you good sir this helps 
@_date: 2019-08-06 23:05:53
I’ve been a bad personal finance person, had to take on the credit card for medical expenses and never stopped DCAing every week. So would you say sell off what I have and pay off the debt ?
@_date: 2019-02-06 15:57:52
Excellent explanation thank you. I will try what you suggested
@_date: 2019-02-06 15:58:06
Yes smarty pants ;)
@_date: 2019-02-06 21:32:03
I love the btcpayserver link as a former dev, it’s beautiful! Thank you!
@_date: 2019-08-07 04:20:04
If I focus most pennies I can pay it off in 6mos in total.
@_date: 2019-02-06 14:21:18
Got it, any recommendations in market places that are crypto friendly? Or just better to make the crypto integration on my Shopify store?
@_date: 2019-02-06 13:42:17
P2P market place for non illegal items...as far as I can tell
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:47:39
I too am interested. I feel like these massive trades are done over IRC chat not sure just a guess 
@_date: 2019-04-22 01:01:06
Could you link to data stating this?
@_date: 2019-01-31 13:17:09
Dam it! I have bots trading looking for profit opportunity. So your saying that best option convert to a spot rate as soon as btc hits my account right?
@_date: 2019-01-31 03:07:39
I too want to do this for my business how do I do tax reporting? Seems like if I cash out I pay the capital gains tax no?
@_date: 2018-07-01 23:13:43
Thank you 
@_date: 2018-07-01 01:01:11
What company makes these and can regular folks buy them?
@_date: 2018-12-20 16:22:30
What’s your best resource to making paper wallets?
