So now you're shifting to supporting you and your mom exclusively using bitcoin? 
No one said it sounded like a scam. We're commenting on your disposition. You saying it's not a scam makes it very apparent that you are scamming. 
Whether or not you truly believe you will make enough profit to live off of, from $100USD (currently .006440 BTC) is beyond me; the point remains, however that $100 would possibly yeild a high result ONLY after BTC hits 50,000+
Even then, you would have $2000 at best. You can't sustain yourself, nor another human, off of that type of income(in USA), unless you get assistance elsewhere. 
Honestly man, you should reach out to Sounds like now is not a time for you to think about investing in cryptocurrency when you can't make ends meet in USD.

@_date: 2017-12-21 20:37:33
Dude, wtf is this incoherent rambling? 
NO ONE is going to send you $100 of BTC for nothing. 
Maybe if you offered to pay them back they'd consider it?? You're just straight up panhandling for cryptocurrency. 
Your post history shows that you've been alluding to having no money and a desire to invest. 
You contridict your own beliefs in 1 sentence "I'm against trading, however ... 'give up my past for crpytocurrency'"
Just face-palming right now, man. If you have $0 but are sustaining (e.g. rent, food, and ability to post on Reddit) why not get a job, or side job and pour that all into crypto? 
According to your post history, you have $15. Invest that! If you believe truly in this up-turn, then invest your 15, take the profit, and diversify. 
You have to start somewhere, but asking people for free crypto is nowhere near the right direction.

It's a futile attempt at dissuading the masses from adoption of cryptocurrency.

Congrats!! Welcome! 
A good piece of advice is never post about how much crypto you have. Big or small, doesn't matter. You're already a target by posting in As others have said, you don't actually fully own it unless you own your private keys. 
Research hardware and paper wallets and carefully research the software (don't generate a wallet online if you can avoid it ). Generate an address and send a smaller transaction to your new wallet as a test. Once that goes through send amounts you're comfortable with (all or parcelled out. Your amount is small enough to feel comfortable sending all after first testing at least one transaction first. )
Now you OWN Bitcoin!

Everyone is relaxed about security until they experience it witness an intrusion. It's still I.T. and it's related to value. Caution should definitely be excersised. Members have frequently been targeted in scams and spoofs. 
Probably not is true, but what about if the value goes 10x? 100x? How comfortable would you be having said your exact balance? Same thing w the people early in BTC who boasted their balances (even if insignificant in value) they're all radio silent now.

Wake up man. Banks can print their own notes. Mints are perpetuating hyper inflation. Maybe study history or economics. Why would the global economy want to trade oil for the Petro dollar? I'd recommend you research the Petro dollar and the USA military complex may make more sense to you. 
We are an old democracy. War feelings are strong and global sentiment of the USA diminishes further. If we threaten their economic growth through trade restrictions and barriers in trade why would they remain inclined to back their oil on the petrodollar? 
These aren't my wishes. Who would wish such a future? The point is crypto strongly stands to change a lot of our lives or at the very least for rest of our natural lives. When it completely takes off as the global currency (Bitcoin) it implies a TON of underlying truths. Your skewed view of reality has no affect on my wishes.

An omni-direction wallet is in the roadmap and plans to be able to straight withdraw BAT to an ETH address is planned.   
IMHO it's one of the best utility tokens to date. It's driving the Brave/BAT ecosystem. The price will not always be coupled with its utility, but mere speculation in its success. 
Gab decided to implement their own version as Brave rewards went live. This is just the beginning and there are many developments and refinement to come.   
I've been talking about Brave/BAT with my circle of BTC investors/hodlers and they were only partially receptive to hearing about it from even over a year ago.   
Their interest piqued when the price went up; my stance remains the same though. Aside from LTC and ETH, BAT is the most useful altcoin in my opinion in terms of potential for success and utility.

Your personal bitterness due to a financial mistake doesn't detract from the use-case of Bitcoin and cryptocurrency. 
What about 1.5 years ago? What about 2 years ago? Value is doing JUST fine.

"defense could at least prove/disprove through due-diligence."

They may not if you use a hardware wallet. Here's the thing,
No one is saying they're omnipotent. If you sell some BTC on an exchange and transfer to your us bank account the IRS is already privy to that. 
So if you never sell BTC and xfer via ACH then you're fine. So the dark web economy still isn't affected.

Both sides of this war, and need to fuckin' unify already. Just nitpicking on both sides. 
IF he released headers, it would be more convincing. Now am I saying with that information, defense could *at least* prove/disprove through due-dilligence. 
What I don't subscribe to is a screenshot of plaintext email as "proof"
@_date: 2018-02-27 00:50:24
That's bullshit. 
If he really wants to prove the date the email was sent, he would post the email header. 
All the info in what servers the email passes through are stored in the header. 
@_date: 2018-02-27 00:51:00
Dude. Email headers. Are you talking entirely out of your ass?

Wait, or contact CB support. This is literally why people say not your keys not your Bitcoin. Had you had this transferred to your own wallet you'd know 100%. Coinbase does batching. Stop posting on Reddit and contact support. Or wait a couple hours and see. 
Contact support.

 21.34 transactions per second right now.
More transactions suggest more interest in transacting bitcoin, for sure.

Dude, checkout mempool in the past ~~8~~ 24 hours
If you were around during the OG bull runs this feels (compare stats with last bull runs on same site for background) really familiar. I've tested some BTC transactions and pending times are growing the feeling is palpable.
To the moon BTC!

10-4 on that 5150 call, good buddy
Im thinking possible 10-15, 10-33 once fiat requires 10-52
For sure a code N, from all the new 510s, 22350, and 23109
In the meantime, remember to 10-23, 10-88
And most importantly remember to 10-6 because 11-58

Indicative of a massive increase in number of transactions. The network always works through them, but these are indicators that have no correlation to TA bullshit. "theoretical maximum" is 27 per second (according to Evangelos Georgiadis -  [ )

Now those are names I can trust.   
I'm talking about the content of the comments therein. You seem to have a vested interest in getting clients to this law firm at the very least. 
Asking people to PM you about it in the past certainly doesn't help your case. Coupled with the fact that 1 hr. before your post I received a random PM from someone else asking if I wanted to be part of their lawsuit against Coinbase.   
Red flag after red flag after red flag. No one's trying to be genius but you. You are trying to swindle people.
