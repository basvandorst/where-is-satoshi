Is it possible to secure an exchange by doing forgot-password every 24 hours or by doing an ACH every week? 
Some exchanges prevent withdrawals for 24-48 hours after forgot password function has been used. Some prevent withdrawals while ACH transfers are being confirmed, which can take a week.
Can these exchanges be secured by repeating these actions over and over (until you need to make a withdrawal)?
If there an exchange with a setting like: [ ] check box to lock withdrawals. Unchecking this box will require a 7 day waiting period where your email/phone will be alerted to the change.

do it, report it
there are hackers who steal coin - but they steal it before the next thief can steal it - and then when the victim asks for help - they return it! Not to get your hopes up, but I've seen that happen at least once. And it happened on reddit.
next, if you report it, maybe you can use it as a loss on your taxes?

"secure" means make my account more secure than it was before taking action x.
If I reset the password, the acct might be more secure for 24-48 hours b/c they block withdrawals.
I get that exchanges can go out of business or betray me, etc. But if for the sake of having a way to trade I grant that the exchange will stay in biz and not betray me, do the steps I mention help protect against attacks from outside the exchange? Or is there a better way to do secure trading?

I get that it's a big risk.
At the same time there is a market where you can make money by buying low and selling high, and doing so frequently, with all your coin not just a tiny amount --- but you can't do it, because of the risk of being hacked --- but maybe some people have figured out a safe way to do it? --- and if they haven't then who's working on a solution to this problem? I'm scared shitless of attempting to do anything with my bitcoin, and that's far from ideal.

segwit cannot tank, it's official BTC.
I think you mean segwit2x, which is a totally different thing, and is the devil.
There may be a fork in the coming months where Bitcoin2X gets created and that will be segwit2x but it won't effect you except to give you free money.
