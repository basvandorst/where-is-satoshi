I think it's safe to say you're an exception. I cannot immagine I understood *anything* of that film if I saw it at 5 years old ;)

Sort of. By it self you'll have to wait for 6 confirmations which will take time. Sites like Bitpay makes that go away. So it *can* be as fast or maybe even faster


Yes! I most certainly am. But that's my problem, and honestly, anyone with half a brain for computer &amp; internet stuffz will be able to keeep their funds (relatively) safe
Remember though, that cryptos are really new and there is already talk about companies starting up that offer insured wallets. So it's coming

It does make sense from a consumer standpoint, of which I am, but you're right that a merchant may not want to speculate in value. But I, as the consumer, would like to use it because it circumvents alot of problems I currently have with traditional finances. And as the merchant, you *can* exchange it to fiat immediately, if you so wish. Eventually we'll see more innovation built ontop of something like BTC, but that's not quite yet

Nobody knows what this is anymore. It's atleast 10 years too old

That's going back to the "why buy a computer now when next year i can buy a much better one". You'll buy a computer now if you feel safe in your personal economics. That's how most of us work

Well, first off, that's my business. A merchant may lose my business if he/she doesn't accept what I want to pay, but that's up to the merchant to decide. But for argumets sake I want to use it because it's fast. It's almost as fast as a credit card, but with lower fees. I don't have to have my bank call me up and ask why I sent some of *my* money somewhere. I can actually hide my transactions if I'm careful with my addresses. And I lastly, and maybe mostly, want to use it for the innovations yet to come :)
Oh, and some of it may grow in value while I hold it. Doesn't mean I'm not going to spend it, but it's like having a bank account with actual rates

maybe. but the secret is; nobody knows. and if they say they do it just means they're lying
