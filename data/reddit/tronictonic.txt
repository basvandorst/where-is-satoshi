Nah, bits is ideal because it uses 2 points of decimal precision - the same as all existing accounting software. 
Plus it's just easier for layperson: 1 million bits in a Bitcoin. Easy, simple. 
Metric units are logical but not everything is logical when it comes to human adoption. 
People don't want to see zeros to the right of the decimal, they want to see them to the left. That's what they are used to.

There is intrinsic value in a robust protocol that is widely adopted. 
The actual bits have no value except that they are scarce and required to operate the network. The network operates on miners validating transactions and the bits they generate have value to them because of the dollar cost in hardware, electricity, rent, etc.  The users of the network protocol need the bits the miners generate. So they give money in exchange for the protocol access. 
As more people adopt the protocol the value will increase due to limited supply of bits. Currently the supply outstrips the demand.

the whole point of economic activity is to ease suffering, first your own, then your family, then your neighbor, and taken to logical conclusion - everyone on the planet.

So if the RNG seed is good then it's ok to reuse public address ??
I don't see how address reuse can be avoided. Suppose you print a billboard with a Bitcoin QR code on it. You can't change that code each time you "spend" the funds in the account that have accumulated. 
@_date: 2014-12-26 22:08:37

I know what it is. I just don't think it's always correct. Nor is it the correct answer in this case. 
I have a feeling you are a marketing guy so you view every decision that a company makes through marketing eyes. I don't think that is why Wikipedia made the choice they did. I suspect their choice was more to the newness of Bitcoin. 
They already have a TON of payment options displayed. Adding Bitcoin to the list isn't going to make a diff. If they were following your advice they would display only 2 or 3. But it's like 5 already. 6 won't hurt.

Broaden your view. It's only down from where it was 1yr ago but it's WAY up from where it was 2yrs ago and merchant adoption is growing fast!

All valid but I would add that by buying botclin you ARE investing in the technology because your money trickles back to the miners which makes the network function. 
@_date: 2014-12-22 02:53:54
So therefor if I post a public address and collect 2BTC in one month and 3 in the next and then if I decide to "spend" the 5 in that address the address is still public and even if I spent the 5 that are in it there is nothing to stop people from sending more BTC in the following months. This means that I will want to "spend" that address again to access new funds that have accumulated. 
It seems impossible to avoid this situation. Once an address is published it should be expected to ALWAYS be possible to receive funds and by extension - spend them too. 
@_date: 2014-12-18 03:24:22

Like I said, disabling the button is perfectly valid approach. But it does have a margin of error that should be considered vs the consequences of that error. 
When doing that type of validation client side you are trusting an unsecured computer outside your control to give you untainted input. Depending on the application this may be acceptable. 
In the world of banking and health I would think this would be an unacceptable level of exposure to outside volatility in which case my approach is more reliable.

There is nothing that can be done to prevent bloat. As Bitcoin grows more and more ideas like this will pop up.

I don't have moral obligations to it. 
I think it is a robust protocol capable of more than transferring value. 
I am a programmer by trade. The tech excites me. I see value in the tech. If I could have bought packets of TCP/IP I would have. 
I do think it's an investment because I think the ENTIRE SYSTEM is growing and maturing. A "share" of that network is called a BTC. So I buy shares of the network to "invest" in the network. 
I do speculate that the value will go up. i think we are arguing semantics at this point.

Isn't Ripple centralized though?
@_date: 2014-12-21 23:45:14
I've looked at Ripple and I have bought XRP and I STILL can't figure out how that thing works. 
As far as I can tell its a big fancy debt exchanger. 
Alice loans Mike $5 who loans Bob $5 so Alice loans Bob $5. Ugh... Complicated mess. 
Plus, it's all through the Ripple wallet. So how is that going to scale? It's not like you are developing a baseline protocol that can be used for smart contracts or multiparty signatures or anything really innovative. It's just, to me, that ripple is just a big debt exchanger and that's it!  
No promise of decentralized computing. No open protocol, nothing but a big fancy distributed system to keep track of debts. 
But if Ripple Corp got subpoena that said "freeze this account" I don't see how the individual would have any protection. 
However, with Bitcoin if I control the keys then I control the funds. 
Ripple - to me - has one thing going for it. It's a decent way to trade USD for crypto. But I wouldn't keep it there. 
Maybe I missed something.

I agree when talking about UI. but if you look at an ATM machine it's COVERED in payment network logos. But yet the utility remains the same. 
In the case of donations the donator isn't faced with a tough choice. Just multiple avenues to arrive at the same destination: giving money. In that case Bitcoin SHOULD be prominently displayed. 
I would display the UI like this:
Select amount to give:
$5, $10, $25, $50, $100, other

Then in the NEXT SCREEN. A list of payment processors, including Bitcoin.

Meh, it's not offensive. It just makes the app look amateurish. 
Apple users expect consistency and quality.   It's why they buy into the walled garden.

How do you know if it's correct or not?
@_date: 2015-01-13 17:50:27
1. Banks are only used instead of vaults because they provide easier access to funds from any location and are generally considered more secure than a vault. However, a hardware Bitcoin wallet is both highly secure and portable negating the need for a bank. 
2. I thought the question was what would have to happen not what would have had to happen.
3. I don't see Bitcoin like a stock or commodity. I see it as a networking protocol that requires tokens to access the network. As the network grows and more people use it then it becomes more valuable and by extension the tokens increase in value as well since they are required to use the protocol. 
@_date: 2015-01-06 06:40:33
You are not open to discussion. You've already made up your mind. I presume you are a paid shill as you seem completely incapable of thinking more than 1 step ahead. Tech doesn't stand still. 
I'll just leave you with this:
You do not need to understand https to use public key cryptography. 
You don't need to setup a stealth address for the sex toy site. Just to yourself, one time, to decouple your public wallet from your private wallet.  Boss pays you in crypto into public wallet. You move it to stealth address and from there nobody knows where you spend it. It's not rocket science. Even that could be automated. 
But have fun with your naysayer bullshit. I'll be busy flying on these radical inventions called airplanes and driving around in these newfangled contraptions called automobiles.

the cart is currently generated dynamically without Bitcoin. There is currently today cpu overhead in adding stuff to a cart. Lots of it!  Logically it should be vulnerable to the exact same attack you specify. But it isn't. Why? Hmmm... Think about it. :)
The same reason it doesn't hurt existing carts is why adding key generating cpu cycles won't hurt it.

Decentralized consensus. 
@_date: 2015-01-13 07:01:59
Bitcoin is not a currency. It's a protocol - it has tokens that move on the network that are intrinsically connected to the operation of the protocol and those tokens are valuable because without them you can't use the network protocol. The protocol offers developers a way to achieve distributed consensus with a high degree of certainty and reliability. This is a computer science break through and developers are just starting to take advantage of its potential.

Cheap (under $10), secure, idiot-proof hardware wallets that do not depend on an external device. 
In the mean time:
A browser plugin that automatically pays site operators in microtransactions under $0.01 for access to restricted content.  Basically automatic paywalls that are so cheap that you don't even realize you are paying them. In exchange for the Paywall tolls we would see LESS ads since the site viewer can now pay the site operator directly instead of the site operator depending on ad revenue. $1 would buy you an ad free month of web.

For the price to stabilize there has to be a very large market. Currently the market is very small. Big fish make big splashy splash. 
Due to the fixed pool of available bitcoins the only way the price can stabize is at a very high dollar value. This will take years

You are going to find it difficult to operate in the world without a tax return. 
furthermore, as much as you may hate the idea of paying taxes.

No. You inferred that's what I implied.

Huge diff between wallet app which is supposed to store your wallet and has audited source code vs a game which sends you bitcoins for playing and looking at ads. 
In the first case the wallet app secures the user's funds. 
In the second case the Bitcoin integration is responsible for securing the DEVELOPERS funds. In that case I would assume an intelligent developer would not have wanted to embed his private keys into the app that would be deployed to every client. Any intellegent person would recognize that you secure your developer keys server side so they are MUCH harder to hack.
It is not stupid of me to presume a person would want to secure his own funds and I would presume that the app developer would want to secure his own funds. It was stupid of him not to do so. not stupid of me to presume his intellect and instinct for self preservation was intact since the mere act of publishing an app does require a certain level of intellectual prowness.

I don't think you really understand what a Trezor is. 
It's a little computer that is isolated from the Internet. It can't be infected with malware, it has an HD wallet seed so you only need the root phrase to restore on a new device if you lose it. It signs the transactions in a secure environment - it's virus proof. SD cards are not. If the machine you use to sign your transactions is compromised by a virus then your coins are gone. 
Note: I don't actually own a Trezor, but I understand the utility. I just keep mine in paper wallet cold storage for long term savings because I look at the difficulty in spending them as a desired feature for long term savings. For spending I don't keep more than 1BTC in a hot wallet. Breadwallet works fine for such a small amount. If I was keeping more in a hot wallet I would get a Trezor. 
@_date: 2015-01-02 23:32:48
Agreed, which is why all wallet devs should give unit display option in settings. It's minimal work for them and makes wallet usage MUCH easier for end users 
Lots of devs forget that average people DO NOT want to think. Nor should they be expected too. 
@_date: 2015-01-06 06:44:56
You just send it to yourself silly. Once. Stealth done. 
But even if you didn't. You can generate infinite addresses and it scales just fine.  Generating new addresses is how Bitcoin works. It's not an issue. 
And yes - you should always send to a new address. That's how Bitcoin works. 
DoS isnt a problem as the first node you connect to will reject the TX if it's malformed or spam. 
Dude - you are obviously just a negative troll who only exists to say "no no no" and you serve no useful function to society. 
If you don't like Bitcoin then don't use it. Why you gotta hate stuff you don't understand?
@_date: 2015-01-06 07:36:43
Stealth addresses aside. If you really just want to be anonymous with your funds after boss pays you then just shapeshift them to LTC and back to new BTC addresses. You may lose a few cents in the process due to Tx fees. no biggie. 
That will sever any link and the funds are then untraceable.
Presume features like this will be automatic in future wallets. We are just at the beginning so evetytjing is manual. 
@_date: 2015-01-13 17:28:40
It's not odd to buy a vault to store your money in at your house. 
Think of a hardware wallet as a vault that is small enough you can fit in your pocket. 
Eventually economies of scale will drive the price down so low the hardware wallet will be essentially free to end users and be given away at trade shows and when signing up with service x y z. 
Also, the people that drive the price up are VOLUME of people. Getting a billion people using Bitcoin will drive the price up. The price goes down because demand is not greater than supply. 25 new bitcoins are made every 10 minutes. 
Facebook is popular because Facebook is popular - same principle.

Banning end to end encryption basically means that app devs are forced to add anonimizing features into the apps and APIs.

Because then it becomes easy to secure bitcoins reliably without any computer skills. This increases adoption rate. If the price of the hardware wallet is under $20 then they can be bonus items given away as gifts and that increases their usage. They become common like USB drives or SD cards. 
The more that people have an easy way to secure them and carry them securely on their person the easier it becomes for people to trade bitcoins with each other both in real life and online. 
It gets Bitcoin out of niche category and solves chicken / egg problem.

No Bitcoin merchant even needs your name or address. 
But a movie with Bitcoin - no ID required.

If the state represents the will of the people this makes sense. 
But when the state is just a puppet for corporate interests then it's not a great idea to increase the power of the state. 
Conversely though, a reduced state power only serves to increase the power of the corporations. 
So a tactic of reclaiming the state from control of corporations should be the priority.

Selling hardware wallets on TV late at night so you can buy shit off of TV by scanning the qrcode on TV would work. 
Wallets are a separate device. They need to be secure as fuck. Not a mobile device controlled by a 3rd party but instead a provably secure hardware spec. Open source and made by the millions. Like USB sticks are so cheap they are given away. 
That's how hardware wallets need to be.

This is an interesting idea but it seems to suggest that app hosts have to run separately under the Codius framework. Bitcoin on the other hand supports scripting already and is battle tested. Scripts execute according to rules defined in the transaction and do not depend on a 3rd party. This makes them a protocol level assurance vs an API extension that may or may not be supported in the future.

All dollars have been involved in a drug deal at some point.  Therefor if you accept dollars you are no different than these guys. 
All money is dirty money. These guys were just trying to sell bitcoins it was the police that went out of their way to make it a crime. 
Your bait car analpgy is flawed because getting in a car and driving away in it is NOT anywhere near the same thing as selling LEGAL merchandise such as Bitcoin or socks. 
The reason I mention the socks is that there is no diff between selling bitcoins and selling socks.  The bitcoins are not illegal to own or sell, neither are socks. Do cops try to set up stings to buy some socks off people with dirty money ?? No they don't. They went after these guys because they didn't like bitcoins.

It's not the same as a bait car. A bait car has no purpose on an economy except to findcar theives. Similarly there are no car theives out there doing legitimate business. 
Bitcoin sales IS legit business. The cops simply created a problem where there was none. The Bitcoin sellers were not out TRYING to launder money.  They just wanted to sell some bitcoins.  Car theives are trying to break the law and not get caught.  These guys were not attempting to be criminals until the cops honey dicked them.

Would someone mind translating this into layman's terms and what it means for the price of Bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-02-09 08:20:40
Hum, kinda condescending remark there. Asshole.

Just use one of the meeting rooms in your local police station or the lobby of a bank.

That's not a cryptic answer. That's literally the truth.

Simultaneously driving the cost of ASIC chips through the floor and resulting in eventual commoditization of ASIC chips on every new device. Just like graphics chips used to be expensive. Or sound chips. Now pennies and on everything.

Here is how I would answer the questions:
1. Buy/sell bitcoins
2. The Internet 
3. My job
4. Selling
@_date: 2015-02-16 17:28:22
Sure - I agree. But acquiring bitcoins is sometimes hard if you go that route. It's maybe easier to buy them identified then scramble them later.

When multi key is standard and exchanges don't actually hold the funds.

You are half right. 
Huge planned cyber attack leads to patriot act style law being rushed through to allow uncompromising survalence on everything.

Basically they just set out to arrest people who were otherwise not intending to break the law. They created a criminal situation to "test" the seller who was simply trying to sell bitcoins. The seller's intention was not to commit criminal activity but simply to sell a bar of gold in the form of Bitcoin. I see no criminal intent or purpose other than what the cops manufacturered. 
@_date: 2015-02-28 23:44:32
Stinging some guys who are selling Bitcoin is a waste of police tax dollars.
They were not money launderers. That was not their intention. The cops made them into money launderers by baiting them. 
If the guys has conspired ahead of time to launder funds I would agree with you. But that's not the case. The cops just created a situation to create criminals. It's not useful for anyone except filling prisons.

No, the original code base written by Satoshi was very poorly architectured. It has since been replaced with more modern constructs. 
The NSA would not produce such buggy poorly engineered code. 
@_date: 2015-02-28 22:42:03
Sure - I agree. But why would the cops create a criminal conspiracy to catch a guy who had no intent of commiting a criminal act? Basically they created a crime and pinned it on a guy trying to conduct a legit exchange. The cops were malicious in my opinion.  
@_date: 2015-02-20 20:43:21
Uh - it's texhnically not possible to back it with a central authority. That would be existing money systems.  Bitcoin works precisely because it doesn't have central backing and is still trustable. 
@_date: 2015-02-02 03:00:06
It's because change tip is centralized. 
We need a tipping system that is decentralized and does not require registration. You should be able to send bitcoins directly to someone's email address without a central registration process. I have been tipped before on change tip and I don't accept them because I don't want to register for the site. I wouldn't register for less than $100.

Well - then we need to figure something out because nobody wants to have to remember a password. Users will use weak passwords because that's their nature.

@_date: 2015-02-25 08:33:02
You are correct. Scanning and sending in person impresses people. I've adopted people sending them $5 face to face before. It makes a lightbulb go on.

1. Needing the cash instantly is important when you are trying to have access to the funds the same day.  Like cash. 
2. No, everyone does not have a bank account - you are simply wrong.
3. Apparently you don't know the difference between cash and credit.  Digital cash is quite an awesome thing. It has all the properties of cash in hand that you can divide up and share between friends or even give to strangers without knowing their name or any identification. Digital cash does all that AND I can send it over the wire. 
4. So much hate - you are angry because technology you don't like exists? Dude - seriously, were you this mad when flat screen TVs came out too?  Or are you just a paid troll ? How's the money in that line of work?
@_date: 2015-02-16 04:26:13
Agreed - retinal scan instead of fingerprint. 
3rd key, recovery key - should be generated on device locally and saved as backup and left to the user to store securely. Just like money, grandma understands securing money is personal responsibility. 
Perhaps an integrated printer or just display a sequence of words and tell the user to write them down then ask the user to type them back in to be sure they actually wrote them down.

So what happens when those valences get transferred into an exchange and then withdrawn a week later to all new addresses?

Say "huh? What? Sorry I didn't hear you.  Sorry I don't know what you are talking about. Please keep your personal business personal. I'm here to sell you bitcoins I don't know and I dont want to know about your money source."

Oh, well - perhaps. 
I link to coinbase. Less intrusive, no photo of hand print. 
Not totally anonymous either, but I just send funds to personal wallet and then shuffle them around some between wallets.
