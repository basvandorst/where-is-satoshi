Everytime I read about the twins it reminds me of that movie The Social Network. The twins will always be playing catch up on Zuckerberg.

They should pay people to run nodes instead of mining. Like they do with Dash, handling the transactions and get payed keeping the node up and running.

Done with coinbase to be honest. Maker Taker fees with my tradingbot comes down to 1% per trade. That's absurd, considering Binance has 0,2%. Coinbase is getting cocky

Came from $50 about a year ago and turned that into $3000, small steps.

Sweet deal 0.2 BTC, to bad it is a scam. Like the dead relative from a Nigerian Prince who is your long lost uncle. Their storytelling is like a bad overrated Bollywood movie.

This was researched once, can't find the source at the moment. But usually Kraken's website stops functioning because it makes them money. When the price crashes the website goes messed up, and vice versa. It's a tactic used by Coinbase as well.

Doomed.... A fix amount is better then the foreign bills where u have to pay 30 million for a bread. Pressing more money doesn't solve the problem.

I hope BCH crashes hard and gets burned to the ground. These man are not right in the head.  Claiming what is not theirs.

Also on Coinmarketcap the second website link leads to Bitcoin.com, which has nothing to do with Bitcoin Core... But is for Bitcoin Cash...

Outgoing and incoming transactions on Coinbase are a joke at the moment. My incoming BTC is pending for 3 days straight.

That many is on a mission, the wrong mission. We know better. Newbies will get burned...and so does Roger... Hope his project gets burned to the ground.

Dayum... Coinbase is a joke nowadays, they will hold on to your funds way to long. I am using Kraken, good service. Website is down sometimes during high traffic, but those boys took the fall for what happened over at Mt. Gox and are doing a great job with adoptions of new coins.

Poloniex will go belly up in the near future now that Binance and others are gaining terrain.

Coinbase, stealing your money since 2012.

Nothing on Coinbase. That's the whole point. Kraken payed out. Coinbase did nothing and kinda "stole" that Bitcoin Cash, they where "looking into it". So B2X, ain't happening on Coinbase I guess.
@_date: 2017-10-25 18:14:21
Like they "supported" Bitcoin cash? The fucked a whole lotta people over on that on.

I have been trying to run a Bitcoin Core node. Why does it take forever to sync up... It says 40 weeks behind and progress is very very very slow!
@_date: 2017-07-24 23:19:12
Can someone explain when I make a txt file called bitcoin.conf and set prune=2000 (which would be 2gb of storage) that the Bitcoin Core node is eating away my ssd GB's? I went from 23GB to 13GB in an hour or so. I thought prune= was to keep the GB low...
