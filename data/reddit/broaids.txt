I'm a Sr systems architect and love both Windows and Linux.  Hating an OS is just fucking stupid especially since I make more because I know both platforms.

I'm a senior systems architect that's designed massive call centers.  Making shit like this takes large budgets , business cases and executive buy in.  You can't build this stuff in the real world unless you're losing money because you don't have it.  You sound like you don't work in the industry or maybe you do but your experience is limited to fixing peoples printer issues.  Even once you get buy in you still have to build it all which takes time.  You sound like someone who has never been involved with a large project.
@_date: 2017-12-02 22:08:43
What does a hardware wallet have anything to do with Coinbase?  Seeing as how you own a Mac I'm guessing you really don't understand any of this.  If I'm guessing the point you're trying make about Coinbase being unavailable or slow then you could have obtained the same result with a software wallet.  Encryption is another topic completely.

The takeaway from this is if you lose your BTC or do some dumb shit like exchange it all for BCH don't kill yourself.  Get back in and HODL.  It's never too late.

@_date: 2017-12-14 19:02:04
Is there a real consequence to the coins being mined?  Seeing as how crypto value is going up across the board and I can buy more with less, that is technically the opposite of inflation.

@_date: 2017-12-13 23:40:18
He's unhinged.  How much money you make has nothing to do with it.  He's loaded but still a douche.  He's self made sure but a "businessman"?  I dunno.  I heard the last time he tried to do business the potential investors called him out on cooking his books and walked out.
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:38:24
You should sign up with an exchange other than coinbase.  You would see that there's a lot more coins.
@_date: 2017-12-05 04:26:57
Oh fuck this is great.  So much irony in this.  Fuck those bcash supporters, you want to support an alt that's cool no criticism, but use the Bitcoin name well fuck you.

You don't get paid as you mine it would be cost prohibitive.  Nishhash pays me out to my private wallet once a week.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:37:41


Your very first sentence shows how ignorant you are about business systems.  50-100 users is most certainly in the Enterprise call center range and you're talking $100-200k if the company does not already have the infrastructure in house.  A company like coinbase would need a full integrated systems like Cisco Unified Communications or Skype for business with additional CRM integration with something like Salesforce.com.  
Management first needs to decide what they want to do then you have to hire and train people and that's after all the IT and business analysts are done with implementation.  This is an example for 100 people, coinbase needs a lot more than that.  You're a simpleton.

Me personally all I would do is contact a CPA explain and go right back into Bitcoin investing/mining. You have the capital for a really profitable small mining operation. Stop thinking that you're done, you're not.  4 mil is a lot but it's not that life changing.  At least for me.
@_date: 2017-08-16 01:12:06

How so?  BTC is pretty much only a store of value at this point.  You can't use it for day to day purchases and I still don't have the BTC I moved from my personal wallet into coinbase over 24 hours ago!  BCH has a valid use right now.  You need to explain your general comments you cant just make broad statements and not expect people to break that shit down.  Big players are doing some shitty things right now but BCH has a lot of valid value.

When you're a small time miner trying to just make back your ROI it absolutely is.  You need a fucking clue, I'm not in this shit to lose money.  It's now at the point where I'm forced to mine BCH if I don't want to convert my BTC to buy more miners.  Jihan set himself up in a nice spot.

All markets have a bubble, it's just "when is that bubble going to pop"?  The tech boom in the 90s didn't pop until it was in the trillions, bitcoin is just as revolutionary and it's still in the billions.  Get in now and even when it does pop if it ever does (I think it will just stabilize) you will still be ahead of the correction price.

You know not of what you speak of.  Those video cards provide the equivalent of a fiat mint and the logistics required to move money around the banking system.  That's a shit ton of fossil fuels and armed men.  You have come to your conclusion without even doing a tiny bit of research.  Crypto may not be for you and that's ok but you should refrain from pulling shit out of your ass and then getting upset about it because you literally just made up a fake arguing point.
@_date: 2017-11-23 22:12:00
Waaah!  Losers still don't understand BCH is another income opportunity and instead of buying the shit when it's low or mining it you bitch on Reddit instead.  I'm fucking killing it playing both sides and the 2 coins really can coexist.  If you actually made transactions with BTC you would know how weak it is right now, BCH actually allows me to move assets around in a timely manner.  Fees I don't care about it is what it is but I need speed and BCH provides that.  Also my miners are pointed at BTC pools at this moment so don't call me a fucking shill, you need to stop being a BTC fanboy and just make money.  I love BTC it's not going anywhere but I'm not going to let money sit on the table. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 23:54:01

Dude this is just flat out wrong.   I would have to eat an entire cup of soy beans to match 1 chicken breast and I eat about 6 a day.  Beans are also not complete proteins because they lack key amino acids that trigger protein synthesis.  If beans were a better source of protein then you would see every pro bodybuilder switch their diets up immediately because their paycheck depends on mass building.  Below is a youtube video of 2 pro knuckle heads that tried to go vegan.  It did not work out for them and would have cost them their careers if they continued because you simply can't be a vegan mass monster.  The vegan pro bodybuilders are very small by comparison and not a single one has placed in an IFBB pro show let alone the Olympia.  I don't hate on veganism at all but your diet is proven to not be able to sustain a demi god.  It's mathematically impossible.

I invest in and mine bitcoin/altcoins/crypo and also run a successful online store.  I make a lot more by keeping that money and pumping it into my own business.  You may be missing out on free money but I have done the math and it's not so great for me.  Also I can't stand bankers, they sound like such fucking douches when they come to my work in their expensive suits but they work for a shitty bank and want me to view them as wall street pros.  Fuck no.  You're also assuming tax rates will be low when you're old, taxes only go up.  I think 401k is going to fuck a lot of people over.

Then why do people keep posting to run full nodes?  I'm a miner I have historically only cared about profits but would like to help out if I can.
This is on the Wiki, is this bullshit?


Full nodes may provide various services to other network participants (if the software is run with -listen=1 as is default). This is especially important for lightweight nodes.




Serving historical full blocks to nodes that have been offline for a while.
Transmitting new transactions from users to miners.
Broadcasting new blocks from miners to other nodes.
For the most part, these services are only usefully performed by full nodes that are listening on port 8333. The more full nodes that accept incoming connections there are, the more users the Bitcoin network can support. Although if there is ever a shortage, lots of archival nodes can be easily created by cheaply renting VPS or AWS space.

Core is still in development the devs are working on it but they just don't put untested potato code into production like other shit coins do.

Soooo tech company.
@_date: 2017-09-08 22:14:43


Nope, I lift weights and already have the hot chick.  I'm content just making money and shutting the fuck up, I don't need to have outbursts constantly on Twitter to validate my life.

I don't think you understand why net neutrality is valuable.

2201 as soon as my node finishes syncing.  I promised I would setup a node as soon as I got my ASIC miners and it's the first thing I did as soon as I saw that magic BTC start pumping into my wallet.

On the Wiki it states just storage space for the hardware reqs.  Would an old dual core laptop be enough?
@_date: 2017-10-24 01:45:17
Cool story bro!  I think you have zero insight into tech manufacture.  They all do the same shit it's just when the media focuses on Apple people like you knee jerk.

My cold storage encrytped disk VM is just fine thanks
@_date: 2017-10-10 04:04:26
This only makes sense if you think all investors are the same.  Walstreet will pump in a shit ton and it will make sense for the price to rise so rapidly.  As long as the math supports it then spikes are fine.

I will probably switch my desktop to a full node once my fucking miners get here.  Fucking Bitmain...  Until then I need that $4 a day.
@_date: 2017-09-27 21:10:28
You people are going to get robbed at gunpoint the thugs won't understand that you don't have your seed on you and you're going to get shot.

Charts and graphs.
@_date: 2017-09-13 20:52:37
You do you bro.  I have traditional investments elsewhere and I already make a 6 figure income from my day job.  I can afford to be agressive in some parts of my life.
@_date: 2017-10-13 02:57:51
Wait for the dip.
@_date: 2017-10-20 13:57:13
Retarded analogy.  Computers only go down in value Bitcoin goes up.
@_date: 2017-10-25 03:31:02
People are having good numbers with it, I'm still getting a feel for my miners, just got them last week and this week is volatile so I'm not positive myself, but I have been making what I believe I should be. 
@_date: 2017-10-11 21:54:22
These things are a waste in my opinion.  Setup a dedicated VM that you only use for crypto.  Last week a dude with a nano still lost his coins because his PC was compromised.  You're not protected by these things once you move your coins to an exchange.
@_date: 2017-09-29 22:05:30
How is this different than fiat?  You're just repeating shit you read on your cell phone's recommended articles to read.  The same thing was said when BTC was 1 cent.  Major fucking banks are pumping money into bitcoin, how is this not registering for you?
@_date: 2017-10-24 01:58:07


Not at all, my GNU/Linux computers have zero backdoors/surveillance and I know that because I can see the code and understand everything.
Heartbleed.  You sound like someone who just got into computers.
@_date: 2017-09-21 17:39:13


All they're doing is making him relevant.  Who cares what this man says, bitcoin was designed to withstand outside bullshit.  This does nothing more than validate his opinion.  In my opinion.  You want to stand up to him?  Buy more bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-10 03:55:49
Because it's tacky white dude shit.
@_date: 2017-10-03 22:29:15
Getting ready to switch over as soon as I hit my next payout.  Friday.  Also once I get my new miners from Bitmain I will dedicate my PC as a full node.
@_date: 2017-07-26 17:19:39
Are you new to Bitcoin?  There are plenty of people who make money on this shit that don't fit the walstreet business man persona.
@_date: 2017-07-20 14:19:28
Your post history paints a picture of a man who is desperately trying to make a lot of money to make up for being weak and ugly.   You're not normal.  Seek help.

My bank transfers have taken over 5 days to go through with them.  I understand what's going on I'm the not complaining with the new crowd.  I can't control when the price is low I have to buy then.
@_date: 2017-07-22 22:02:57
IMO copying your opponents logo makes you look weak and shows no pride.
@_date: 2017-07-29 01:22:38


Because Linux is a fantastic appliance OS.  That however is not a desktop OS.

Why is getting your money out hard?  You can do a bank transfer right from the site.
@_date: 2017-07-29 17:13:30
All of my transactions with them have been going through.  They're just bombarded with new business and have to move everything in cold storage batches most likely.  That takes time.
@_date: 2017-07-29 01:10:13


This is why we have over 200 flavors of Linux.  There are benefits to this absolutely but it's also why Linux will never be an OS the common user has on their desktop.

I bench 315 for reps, grow up.  I've blown 43k In a few weeks sorry for being just a bit sensitive to my wife's concern.  I plan to still be married in 10 years.

Look man I didn't mean to strike a nerve I was merely trying to point out forking provides options but it does not always mean the best path for user adoption.  We could go round and round about this but I don't really have an argument vs an observation.
@_date: 2017-07-21 16:47:31
People have lives, not everyone gives a shit about the drama of Bitcoin, they just see it as an investment opportunity and sign up.  I see no problems with that.
@_date: 2017-07-18 22:05:50
Damn it feels good to be a first time buyer!  Wish I could do more but wife will freak out if I spend more than $1k.

I appreciate your passion.  Keep up the good fight.

I just bought a TRD Tundra without her input.  I'm in too hot water.
