A sortof usb stick which only task is to safely store your Bitcoin. Due to how it's built it's impossible for anyone to compromise it, even if you use it on a unsafe computer.
@_date: 2016-08-06 23:30:00
If you entered those words on a computer which has been used for other activities, then yes, I would not trust that Trezor anymore.
However, if you have lets say 10Btc on the device and it doesn't move the next months, then I would consider it "medium safe" and I would be comfortable with having 10-200Btc on it. (Given the fact that you formated the computer in which you entered those words)
Just how I would go about it :)

Bitcoin related patents, all i know.
A natural next step for a egocentric con-man. Very unnatural for Satoshi as we know him/they.
Also contradictory with the statement that Mr.Wright "just wants to be left alone"
Well sir, maybe not make claims without backing them up for then to file Bitcoin patents. Would be a great start to stop that if you actually don't want attention :)
Why would Satoshi file Bitcoin patents, it's so stupid that the fact that Mr.Wright did almost disproves his claims right there. I would argue that Satoshi is the last person on earth that would file a Bitcoin patent.

Whatever you do, make another copy of that .dat file asap.
Then just try different things you find on google and whatnot. Maybe just manually enter the keys on blockchain.info or something.
Alternatively there is this "wallet recovery service guy" who has helped a lot of people.

Aren't you by this sortof saying that longterm Ethereum would be better for this spefiic porpuse, however you would need to redo so much code it will be a hassle?
If so then, what happens whens someone does make Datt for Ethereum? Wouldn't it be technically better and have more synergy with all the dapps and whatnot?
GL to the devs tho, Datt seems awesome and I LOVE the concept. Guy who made that and the logo knows whats up btw


About this, not wanting to come across as an Ethereum shill but Bitcoin would of course be as useful regardless of what blockchain Datt lives on. Probably people will pay for "gas" on Ethereum primarily with Btc imo, especially if Bitcoin retains it's nr.1 spot as "internet money" which it most likely will.
This is mainly the problem Btc has atm imo, People can place their DAO and Dapps and whatnot on Ethereum without much if any loss really as Bitcoin can be seamlessly integrated within it and function fully as it would have purely on the Bitcoin chain.
So it's like why choose to stick with A when option B gives you both A and B


I strongly disagree. Atm if you want to crowdfund a dapp or start a DAO you are better of using the Ethereum client than if you did it via Bitcoin at this moment. Both in regards to smart contracts but also considering the amount of new wealth within Ethereum hodlers hands. That's just a fact. Doesn't mean I love Bitcoin any less tho as everyone else here
@_date: 2016-04-04 09:44:59


There will be a lot the next 1-2 years, just digix and slock.it which are the two major ones will have synergy with a lot of other dapps.

I thought it was well established that the Wright guy was a fraud. I remember someone looked into it and determined that lots of the things listed on his linkdin were those degrees you get by paying $200 to some made up internet university.

In an ecosystem consisting now of hundreds of alternative coins, one which atm kicks Btcs ass tbh, things like this is so concerning.
It is almost unbelievable and makes me think there are layers to this outside of the obvious blockstream corruption. There is huge financial incentives to strangle  Bitcoin, those with that opportunity can make a fortune.
@_date: 2016-03-29 03:05:42


Yes, but ensure that you have a backup please (if u haven't already)


I don't use multibit but I assume the "tip" your referring to is just the mining fee which multibit displays in USD (although in reality it's given in Btc). Or perhaps you mean that you want to send 0.02 in which case the USD amount is purely there to illustrate how much those Btc are worth in USD I guess :)


Depends if there are any fees on withdrawing. If not you should get something like 0.0199 maybe.


Yes :)

Only read like the first two sentences, but I got the idea. So I take it you have no problems with people happily putting themselves in a conflict of interest. Even when the topic is incredible important for humanity going forward. Okay then.
I guess we should just take it as a coincidence that blockstream pays the devs thousands of dollar each month and the roadmap happens to perfectly align with blockstreams best case scenario :)
@_date: 2016-03-29 14:20:42

@_date: 2016-03-26 17:59:57




If you can't see the conflict of interest in this then I don't know what to say really :/
Are you saying that the blockstream investors are paying the devs salary out of pure good intention as a form of charity? Or do you submit to the fact that there is an underlying economical incentive behind it?
If so the series of event and decisions we have seen are self-explanatory really and they are all beneficial for blockstream longterm.. Maybe so for Bitcoin as well, depending on what glasses you have on, but that doesn't change the fact that we are witnessing blatant corruption and censorship. 
And for the first time ever a company with the means and ability can to steer Bitcoin in whatever direction they want.
You like that?
@_date: 2016-03-26 18:18:36




I will help you understand this.
The amount someone bribes someone with is insignificant as long as it gives enough financial incentive to "play along".
The devs intentions may not be bad and why would they reject free money when they would work on Bitcoin for free given how valuable that position may be longterm. (And how fun and awesome it is for various personal reasons)
However any unaffiliated company that is developing tech for Bitcoin, especially tech which is trying to be an integral part of Bitcoin going forward and basically replace Bitcoin as we know it, should not be giving money to the developers of Bitcoin..
It creates a large conflict of interest, where it will be difficult for the devs to go against their "dad".
Not only that, but after the money comes meetings, trips, talks, friendship and a series of other events directly tied to the money essentially merging blockstream and the Bitcoin devs into a single unit, working towards the same goal. Which is, as always, in any business: "How to make more money"

A tad naive to think that one guy is behind this. You do realize that some of the smartest guy in crypto are praising Ethereum as of late? And that the interest and hype is real. There are newspapers all over the world writing about Ethereum atm.
There is natural growth and real substance behind the price increase if you take a real look my friend
Sure some guys are only interested in shorterm profit and try and create creative spam and such, but does that mean that Ethereum has no value/potential? I remember same thing happened early with Bitcoin, tons of people posted that the value increase was just a pump with all sorts of theories as to who and why. They where obviously wrong, are u sure that u aren't in that boat now?

U may be able to click somewhere to view old/used addresses within ur wallet. Either way the address u sent to previously or gave to others still work, u can test that by sending a very small amount to it just in case.
If you are planning on storing more btw I would strongly recommend buying something like a Trezor device, or alternatively store the coins on your own offline computer. But the Trezor option is more noob friendly and thefor a lot safer.

Bc u made a spectacle about just sending another picture, which is EXACTLY what some fraudster would do, bc he would not be able to. From their pow u look shady now, obviously.
Think about it, why would they request another image if the other one was good? What would they gain by doing so? They want you to use their platform, they want to earn fees on your trades. Nothing they have done is in their own best interest here.. Think about it. They are actually proving themselves to take laws and regulation  very seriously, which is good and exactly the type of platform I would want to trade on.
If u want shady no hassle trading use btc-e or something. It's awesome until the day it isn't ;)

Ur good, probably just a delay on Coinbase part. If you suspect that the electurm wallet might have connection issues you can always just past the adresss on blockchain.info and see if something has been sent or not.
Make sure you have a backup of the wallet though.

I do agree. Although just bc of how scarce and actually useful it is it will always have a reasonable value I think
@_date: 2016-06-24 09:19:36
Wow, sry about ur loss. You should have made a backup, or just written down the "backup code" which is essentially what it is. But that is easy to say now and no point in crying over splilt milk.
About recovering, I'm not sure, but maybe there is a way to restore the wallet by using a special type of software? I know if you format your computer hardrive it's often fairly easy to restore the wallet, so I assume same logic applies to mobile phone hardrives. Could be be wrong but worth searching around. In the case it is possible, make sure you do not use that phone for anything, as any action you do has a chance of overwriting the space in which the wallet is located. GL


Having degrees has litte to do with being smart fyi. It shows that you are good at remembering things and structured/able to attend classes and tests, but that is all. You could be smart nevertheless and the fact that you got involved with Bitcoin, despite it not working out, is indeed proof that you do have some smart in you  ;)


GL trying to use the internet when that first came out. You literately had to have a math/science degree and learn how to program yourself to get anything done. For someone who into computers Bitcoin is very straight forward, but unfortunately for the rest it can be confusing and hard for the rest. As time goes this will be ironed out. People won't even know that they are using Bitcoin sometimes, or think about it.  The same way internet work today.
@_date: 2016-06-15 03:32:31


Appearently not, bc it was not accepted.. hehe. Like, even if for some miracle the Kraken support guy saw wrong, then just send a new image..
Why would they agree to skype when you can so easily just send a new image? They have limited time, they can't talk with everyone on skype, especially not for small issues like this,
@_date: 2016-06-02 17:56:05
They are having an unaffiliated third party verify that they hold exactly the amount of gold corresponding to all existing DGX tokens.
As for the government issue, for that to happen a prominent government would then literately have to commit theft versus thousands of people all over the world, for no justifiable reason. I can not see that happening. And even if there should be any risk of this then nothing is stopping Digix from opening other vaults elsewhere. 
And actually it wouldn't surprise me if they open such a vault some day, perhaps in a place which is extremely privacy and freedom friendly. Why not :)

Bc the rally was caused by China and now the asian markets have started to recover, as of yesterday.
@_date: 2016-06-02 17:58:20
It actually is, because then you can transfer a billion dollars worth of gold within a second, to anyone, for a very low fee. 
And it's more than "representing", all gold held by Digix are verified by an unaffiliated third party, proving that they hold exactly the amount of gold corresponding to all existing DGX tokens at all times.
So it's literately like Bitcoin, but pegged to the price of gold instead.
@_date: 2016-06-18 02:31:03
No :)
@_date: 2016-06-03 14:35:25
Lol, yeah it's bad bc maybe some extremely unlikely scenario might happen..
How about just accepting that it has real legitimate usecases today, with extremely good security, allowing people to transmit billions of golds transboarder with nearly no fees.
But yeah, it's bad bc in 1933 the US government took peoples gold.. lol
@_date: 2016-06-03 09:41:17
Except that the gold stored can be internationally insured and spread out within several vaults all over the world and continuously verified by an unaffiliated third party that is incentivized to find any problem whatsoever, literately making the DGX token function as any other crypto currency but 100% tied to the price of gold at any given moment.
Is it perfect? No, but come on, this is cool and functional and lots of people will have a use for it, within everything from video games to crypto exchanges who want to offer people to option to make short therm trades vs gold.
@_date: 2016-06-15 15:56:55


Lol, so there was an issue with the image after all and by accepting it, without being able to clearly read everything they would literately break the law and would incriminate themselves by doing so.


Ehm yeah


Bc they are not legally allowed to do so at  this point and would be fined for doing so? Like you laws and shit.


Bc you failed to deliver a fully clear photo of ur ID and when ask to resend u did not. I would say 70%+ of all similar situations this ends up being a stolen ID used by a "crook"


They do require photo ID once a certain threshold has been met, as any other exchange or financial institution does. Even Polo ask for your ID if you reach a certain volume and they don't even deal with USD.


Literately thus far everything you have said has been that Kraken is doing exactly what they should and personally I'm impressed. They apparently take the law and guidelines given very seriously.
In the end tho, just take a new photo :) Like, I don't get why that is such a problem unless of course that is not u

This has less significanse than you think. Answer these questions:
1. You made a backup, where did you store it? Within your email address? If so then if someone got access to your email they got access to your Bitcoins.
2. Have you installed any dodgy software on the computer which you used to access your email and blockchain account? For examples and especially pirated games with keygens and so forth?
3. Do you use the same computer which you store your bitcoin on for surfing unkown and high risk websites?
4. Do you use teamviewer? A lot of reports as of late saying its vulnerable.
5. Have anyone else than you access to your computer?

Unless you hold gold for investment purposes or to mitigate risk with volatile crypto currencies.
Or if you are gaming company or any other entertainment medium which wants to utilize digital gold in some way.

U signed a message, from a bitcoin wallet that contains literally zero Bitcoins. What are u afraid is gonna happen? :)
@_date: 2017-08-23 21:34:57
Sure, but the situation is more complicated than that. The "company" now holds many times as much in value as when the "liabilities were calculated", primarily due to the "main asset" (bitcoin) appreciating in value.
Given the fact that there are both fiat and bitcoin claims this creates several potential unfair consequences and for sure, opens this up for further scrutiny.
One party stands to potentially profit, while the other one is locked in at a 80% loss.
As I wrote in my post. Imagine the scenario in which the gox aftermath killed bitcoin, every btc claim would essentially be worthless. Should those that held worthless bitcoin on gox share the fiat others held? Of course not, that would be retarded, and the same argument could be made that it's not fair to take my Bitcoins and give them to others, who may already have been paid back 100% of their fiat claim.
There will obviously be years of prolonged legal chitchat if the trustee is unjustly benefiting some party, while grossly harming another. (which is illegal in Japan but u already know that)
One could even argue that those responsible for not safeguarding users funds would stand to profit unjustly..
@_date: 2016-06-18 20:14:32
If he was able to get those files from the broken hardrive, then I would assume it would be possible to get the file or cookie which has the keys.
Don't mess around with that hardrive tho, and if the amount is considerable the first thing u should do is clone it.
@_date: 2016-06-02 17:59:34

@_date: 2017-08-23 15:35:09
From how u wrote that, I assume u have fiat in ur claim and not btc ;) Actually, although creditors "agreed", it's not that clear, because it was a decision made at the time, by the trustee, to find a fair distribution approach, however now that Btc has gone up, it's not that fair anymore, similarly as if btc had gone to near zero, one could argue that btc hodlers shouldn't get fiat from the fiat hodlers.
Will be exiting to see what the trustee does and how this plays out :)

Been saying this since day1, storj is almsot a scam.
they started of by forcing people to buy tokens in order to beta test..
They did a distribution of tokens during that beta based on some numbers they claim represent how much an individual contributed. The kids could have just taken the majority of said tokens, and no one would have known. Common fucking sense, dictates that they milked that situation hard.
They first say they will burn the remaining tokens after ICO, then the say "dunno", then they say nahh we will keep them, then they say, "we will sell them in another ico"

Rest assured that they only accept claims that reflect the accounts balance, sortof the point with the whole thing, their only job ;)
But, what is this far unknown is if there will be some "rollback" or adjustment given the fact that a huge amount of Bitcoins was traded for very low the last days of the site life. Personally I hope not. And in fairness those who did buy Bitcoin at the end took a calculated risk as one would think having fiat would be better, turns out Bitcoin was as good, if not better.
@_date: 2016-02-16 23:35:45
Good point, you are most likely correct.
Could be the Fiat part was handled a long time ago, as it should be easier. In that case, if they have gone through all the claims they should have a ballpark figure at least

Lending on exchanges is -ev, unless the rate is stupidly high.
1/3 of all exchanges have been hacked. Add the chances of your private account getting hacked and the worry/stress associated with knowing that you have funds are at risk = just not worth it.

Because there is less of a chance of you messing up. Also A Trezor is easy to use and does not make the stored coins any less safe contrary to paper wallets, which require a several step process each time you want to spend some.


No I think, but it's the most convenient solution available. I believe there are resouresses avaialbe which eanbles you to send without connecting to the trezor webste and as a last resort you always have the option to enter your "backup seed" within almost any online wallet and restore your bitcoins there. (similar to how you would use a paper wallet actually) Anyways, you will soon be able to use your Trezor with a bunch of other wallets like jaxx and even Mist for example.


Yes. It means that Electrum has built in support for Trezor enabling you to create an Electrum wallet which uses your Trezor as password. Basically making your Electrum wallet completely un-hackable, unless someone gains physical access of your Trezor.


Any wallet which has that feature I believe. For example blockchain.info.


Very easy. The hard part is making sure every word is written correctly and that you still have it in readable condition 10years later.


Visuals. They are very similar. Both are working on altcoin support for example, although Trezor looks like it will offer that first.
Btw, there is a third option. "Ledger wallet nano s". It's arguably the most up to date device, although Trezor seems more reliable imo.

I had same issue, but for me changing usb cable solved it.
you can reset the device by using the key/word sheet you wrote down when you set it up the first time. I think it's also possible to use those keys with some third party wallet to access the Btc.

Do not use that harddrive for anything. Every action you make, website you visit, file you download now owerwrites that space in which your Bitcoin wallet file is located.
So someone knowledgable will be able to restore the wallet. There are software you can download yourself that does this fairly easily.
What I would do is this:
1. Preferably make a clone of the hardrive (only needed if the amount is substantial.  Then install some "restore deleted data" software and look for the .dat file.
Alternatively you could:
2. Remove hardrive
3. Insert hardrive in another computer
4. Install "restore deleted data" software
5. Search for .dat file on the hardrive you inserted using software.

@_date: 2016-05-28 06:49:57
This sucks :(


Case solved I guess.
Unzipping the wallet for brief moment doesn't actually make that much difference. You are I assume typing that zip password on your (most likely) compromised computer.
Also if you delete the wallet.dat it's still possible and fairly easy to restore it. Unless you deleted it with a tool which specifically overwrites that particular hardrive space

No, lots of "business men" are connartists.. A surprisingly large number of them actually. In this case there are documented lies with lots of warning signs, starting with his unwillingness to provide super easy proof, using the system he supposedly built himself..... lol.
Not to mention the "super computer" he says he has, but there exist zero proof of. A part from himself adding it to the "super computer list". And not to mentioned his linkdin profile (now deleted) which contains a stupid amount of degrees and whatnot, clearly belonging to a guy with some issues.
I even remember some of those being $200 internet degrees.. 


Bc he had no choice? Anyone claiming to be Satoshi will be expected to simply sign something publicly with one of the keys Satoshi is known to posses. There is no logical reason as to why Satoshi should not be expected to do so and it's the best proof available.


At this point if he is Satoshi he has mental issues, bc it makes no sense to go about it this way. 
All Satoshi would need to do is publicly sign something..
- He posts lots of "clues" online, making it seem that he wants to be revealed.
- An employee leeks private emails/docs "proving" Craig is Sathosi but the document contains lots of errors.
- Craig says "he wants to be left alone" but drags out the process of his reveal over months, attending interviews, adding fuel to the fire. Actually hiring a PR company.. Not even joking.
- He make little to no contribution to the Bitcoin debate during this.
- He has his house raided by cops for tax reasons..
- There is proof that looks like he bought Bitcoins for $1100 or something
- Sathosi had private conversations with lots of people. Do you realize how easy it would be to convince 90% off all the Bitcoin developers with just a 10min convo?
- He has not logged in or used any of the accounts associated with Satoshi. Would also be solid and super easy proof, don't ya think?
- He has not an expensive house and car.. Weird for someone who literately has hundreds of millions. So he is Sathosi but is yet to make almost any profit? Don't think so

yup fore sure, 100% confirmed that the banks will transfer all that wealth to a few thousands internet geeks. 
But wait, what if all those internet geeks used their new wealth to buy all the bitcoins back from the bank?

Of course Bitcoins "dream" is to be unregulated, anonymous and safe. But there is a difference between Bitcoin and EXCHANGES. Lol. These sites are trading in USD.. Which comes with all sorts of laws that if you don't follow them the operators literately goes to jail. Got it?
Like, do you think these exchanges want to use resources and time on following all these laws and whatnot? Of course not, but they have to, literately zero choice here. You either cooperate or your in jail 3months later.

For every coin they would buy, the price would go up, thus buying a large amount of coins, say for example 50% would be extremely costly.

Lol.. Ur like everything that's wrong with Bitcoin. Trying to create controversy where there is none.
Everyone cooperates with the government, especially financial service providers. If they don't they get shut down and thrown in prison. There are laws you know, which these sites have to follow. 
Props to coinbase for following the law, acting ethically and doing everything they can so that we can buy Bitcoins safely.

Lol this is laughable. Stopped reading at: "We can confirm that we hold a very low amount of dash, therefor that argument is refuted" 
As if just saying that is enough.. Obviously the Dash devs probably hold a sick amount of coins. They had the opportunity to do so given the instamine and nearly free coins that as a consequence hit the exchanges. Did they not buy those "free" coins knowing what they knew?
Or are you shills saying that they did a shady instamine randomly? With no plans behind it? Or could it be that they knew they had solid plans for the coin and wanted to accumulate as much as possible..
Shady dash coin is obviously shady.
And Amanda is obviously a greedy scammer for siding with them. (alternatively oblivious and just naive as hell)
@_date: 2016-07-06 17:38:49


Lol what? 


LOL you can't be this stupid, I refuse to believe anyone is this stupid. This might actually be the most stupid reply I have ever seen
Of course it was worthless. That is what enabled the dev to accumulate almost all of them. That and the instamine. I don't get what your point is? Like does the coins being worth very little disprove anything? No. The plan obviously was to start a coin, accumulate as much as possible, develop said coin. And he did so in a very shady way. =all trust lost. This is why you see zero adoption and no legit fiat exchanges accepting the coin fyi
He had tons of servers up and running. (proven fact) He even said day1 "Will not launch today" but then he did so anyways, (proven fact) even with a broken client, so no one could actually mine. (proven fact) Then after he got millions of coins he lowered the marketcap, increasing the "value" per coin. (proven fact)


Would love to meet her, I bet she is just as bright as her child.


I was speaking generally, as in this is usually the strat with all shady premines. The devs knows they have a solid idea and will make it into something worthwile, therefor they obtain a lot of coins maliciously out of greed. However by doing so obviously they risk a lot. Unfortunately for Dash it destroyed their reputation.


Being completely honest. You might be the dumbest person I have ever discussed anything with. I genuinely feel embarrassed for even replying.
@_date: 2016-07-06 18:01:28


That is a proven fact. The dev even said "will not launch today" but then did so anyways. The client didn't even work. He then lowered the marketcap after the "fastmine"
And this coin coincidentally gets a rename with a solid plan later on. Give me a break. It was a shady start and everyone knows this by now. The dev is can not be trusted. 


Was it a coin vote? lol. Like, this has zero meaning. If I created a coin, made it nearly impossible for anyone else to mine, then went on forum asking if we should redo no one would give a fuck. And if one random guy gave a shit I would just buy 2 shill accounts that said no.


You are a shill at this point. Trying to skew that arugment in a possitive light. This is very disenginous.
Of course the coins were dumped, the dev had zero trust given what he did. No one wanted to buy because of that, which allowed the dev to accumulate even more coins..
It was not fair situation as you hilariously try to paint it. 
So in fact what you tried to say was a positive thing, actually is a huge negative. One could argue, that clearly knowing what the dev knew about future plans, most of the exchange coins went his way as well, so he could sit on 99% or something ridiculous, wouldn't surprise me at all.


Yeah I was waiting for it. Here we go, trying to shill at every opportunity. Hoping to get more people to buy 1k coins for $7 each  from the "fastmine"

Ur essentially giving money to an individual who is telling u that he has a successful trading bot. Nothing transparent about that. ZERO. Ur essentially trusting some guys, who u don't know to hold ur money, while u get a few % in return if the platform continues to grow until ur coins are released back.

Lol no one is arguing that 1 person holds 100% of the masternodes. The dash guys are doing a great job at marketing their premine, sure some victims have been lured in, that is comon sense.


No one cares about the system. The whole thing started out as a scam. That is what people care about.


Sure there are some possitives to everything, but it doesn't bother you at all that he lied and took a millions of dollars for himself? So much so that your are here defending an arguably criminal act. Ohh okay then. 
What happens if those who hold the "premines" decide to dump? Investors will sit there with their worthless tokens.


You are so fucking cute, seriously. lol, that almost unreadable and illogical sentence doesn't even deserve a reply.
- Lots of scammers and shady people are known, genius. That doesn't prevent them from stealing money and in a lot of cases it's beneficial.
- Of course he is still coding/working for Dash. He owns probably 90%+ of all the Dash coins. He is more motivated than anyone to ensure that his fortune increases. Lol.. This is the plan with any premine, grab all the coins, make coin into something great, cashout.
You are exactly the type of person who falls for premine scams like this. Incredible naive and no logic anywhere.
