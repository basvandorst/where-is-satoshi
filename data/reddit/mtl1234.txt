I'm not sure I understand what you mean by "Any way to have coins we are following in one chart". Would this be what you mean?

It is free.
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:17:58
Could you retry? It seems to be working now.
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:04:36
That is in the roadmap! I was wondering how to prioritize this feature. I feel the same way so might prioritize further :D. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 22:57:28
Desktop only for now. Just validating the idea before moving on a UI for mobile if this is something people would actually use. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:19:25
Currency change seems to be a big demand! Will put in my priority list.
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:17:47
It's in the roadmap! I'm happy to hear about the bloomberg of crypto haha
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:00:21
This is so you can save your dashboards and other future settings!
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:20:22
It's in the roadmap actually. I was thinking of putting this as one of the premium features. Curious to know, would that be something you would consider paying monthly?
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:19:01
Wanted to validate the idea first! Mobile responsive would be one of the first next steps!
@_date: 2017-12-25 22:16:59
What do you mean by "Throw in a Bitcoin"?
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:02:07
What do you mean by insecure?
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:04:02
Oh! Will definitely look into it now!
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:18:34
Not there yet! I wanted to validate the idea first before going deep into each single exchanges! Would this be a tool you want to use if you could choose the exchange for price charts?
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:45:30
Would this be something you would want to use daily? Looking to hear some validation before going all out on improvements. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:21:04
I was pondering between what people would want for Top or recent. I went with Recent tweets since the initial goal is to be first to act on news. I may be wrong though!
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:20:09
How big is your screen if I may ask?
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:37:39
The site you currently see will be all free. It's the premium features that I will add that will not be free (sentimental analysis, social trend patterns, price/volume alerts,etc.)
@_date: 2017-12-19 10:28:12
Trying to get feedback, what do you mean by "that's not how any of this works?" 
@_date: 2017-12-25 22:02:00
[Bitcoin and Ethereum full dashboard + Real-time coin tracking+ many charts in one page Screenshot]( Am looking for as much feedback! Thanks! What features would you absolutely need?
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:58:54
Hi! Could you send a screenshot please! This is not supposed to happen and will fix immediately!
@_date: 2018-03-09 20:25:43
Basically I'm looking to find exactly what traders need in a dashboard tool? Whatever it is I can build it quick and offer you the best tracking tool. Whatever it is, you can comment below. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 19:59:18
Good idea thanks! 
@_date: 2018-03-09 19:53:25
Here's a good idea on the features: 
@_date: 2018-03-09 20:00:26
There is no download. It's a web app. I'm not sure what you're talking about, do you have a screenshot?
