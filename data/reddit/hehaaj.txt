This is amazing setup like you must have read it million times from other users but seriously you're amazing bunch of people.
I myself have been working on the exact same principles form last couple of month not for ASCI but GPU based mining rig cooled by mineral oil in closed circuit which is cooled by radiator and water. 
I'm surprised you did exactly the same. But since you've done it already i would really appreciate if you can share two things
1- Since you're overclocking (thats exactly this setup is suppose to do), How much you're saving in terms of electricity, since the system remains cooler even at overclocking giving you more hashrates with less electricity consumption. Have you tried a test case of using same settings with and without and see if there is any difference in power consumption. As per my academic research, it is support to reduce power intake by 10-20% and increase efficiency by 20%, so virtually you can gain around 30-40% more through this setup.
2- What have you learned from this setup, any major lessons, would super super appreciate to share the lessons. 
Ps. one thing you might incorporate that would make it even better. Instead of running the water over your radiator which will eventually clog the radiator because of minerals in ground water, use a cellulose pad instead. Run water over them, place them behind the radiator and since you're already running fan so it would push cool air on radiator. The water won't get heated in fact cooled every time it passes through the pad, making it even more effective over time. I've got loads of other ideas would like to discuss with you, if you're interested.
