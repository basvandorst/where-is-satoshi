Try using purse.io for Amazon purchases. It's amazing and I'm surprised more bitcoin redditors aren't using it.   You can ask for more but I typically ask for 35% off.

Well, when I made it, my goal was to make a cool bottle opener.  Didn't think I would spread much bitcoin awareness through a bottle opener.  But then again, maybe my opener is the 'killer app' we've all been waiting for.  I'll submit version 2 in a week or two for beta testers/drinkers. Appreciate the feedback.

Confido looks cool.  Look forward to its release.  In the meantime, I posted the opener on purse.io at the following link.  Let me 
 know if you're okay using that service.

I can engrave any crypto logo or even QR code.

Thanks for the interest.  I can make you one this weekend.  As long as you're in the US, just send .007 BTC to 1xLaEQuVKGMLyPevZaZ8xxJw6QY56xkBQ and email me your address.  I'll have one out to you first thing Monday.  If outside the US, I'll have to adjust cost for shipping.
