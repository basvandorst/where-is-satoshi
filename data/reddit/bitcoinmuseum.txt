Ok, copy that...yep, it was btcwallet.com to GAWminers for 1.1...crazy right?
@_date: 2014-10-31 00:11:37
Yeah thats a good call. I think I may do that. A lot of bitcoin millionaires that may just want it to have it. Thanks

Website:  
@_date: 2014-12-15 16:33:38
I know, its funny...I just want to find out who sent it.
@_date: 2014-10-26 08:52:41
Thank you, we actually have one and I think it made the picture. Its not mining anymore obviously, but hopefully there will be a use for them down the road.
@_date: 2014-10-24 05:03:08
Oh sorry, yeah, thats definitely photoshopped. We would like to raise some bitcoins for that, yes. Its going to cost about 3 bitcoins to do it like you see. And the street gets 20-30,000 cars a day.
@_date: 2014-10-24 03:53:16
This is definitely a place bud. The address is where we are right now, and its a technological institute. So we do stuff like 3-d printing and drone classes. Anything to keep the lights on and the bitcoin museum open. We have a titan coming tomorrow, so that should be paying the rent for the next few months at least. We are also setting up a trading bot, and offer classes and online classes. So yes, its real and we are excited to try to make it work.
@_date: 2014-10-24 12:00:24
Yeah, we dont run the avalon. Just the gridseeds, some S1s and S3s, then the Titan is coming and Neptunes hopefully soon.
@_date: 2014-10-24 17:19:57
Well the charlottes web strain is legal in Florida. So those nurseries are going to need workers that know a thing or two before they show up. We teach what you should know. But mainly we want to be set up in case the bill passes on Nov 4th. Yes on 2!  Ive been a grower in LA for 10 years, thats what enabled me to find bitcoin. Those are all personal grow pictures on the site. No stock photos here.
@_date: 2014-10-24 10:07:10
Hey Frankenmint, we have an avalon too, the 60GH, paid 4,000 in july of last year. So it turned out to be a solid purchase. But, that will be on display. We are not going to have room for much more. We have 3 of the KNC bonus Neptunes we are expecting sometime. Once we get those, we can really put some money into this place. But thanks, anything like that would be great.
@_date: 2014-12-15 17:31:49
Sent to my gmail account that has been phished to extinction. All these garbage bitcoin sites with no security or protection whatsoever. This was my response. I have elaborated a bit since, and have tried to get more details like you said.
"Fucking bring it pussies"
@_date: 2014-10-24 13:00:55
A little bit of both I guess. We locked this place down like Fort Knox though. Biometric locks to get inside the bitcoin museum vault.
@_date: 2014-10-24 08:55:30
Good call, we will have a monitor up with our trading bot. But that would definitely be cool too. I think we can figure that out with just another screen. Id like to have that new documentary The Rise of Bitcoin playing on loop too
@_date: 2014-10-26 04:32:37
Cool, thanks. We will be setting up virtual tours very soon.
@_date: 2014-10-24 09:04:32
We teach bitcoin classes, as well as 3-d printing and drone classes. So its geared around medical marijuana, but its a technological institute and we love bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-10-24 12:29:37
ohh, yes...I see what you did there. I was told there would be no math on this :p
@_date: 2014-10-24 09:45:43
Thanks, yes, we are adding a Titan tomorrow, some gridseeds, and neptunes. Then we will have miners on display, and hashing, and for sale. Avalon 1st gen, blades, USBs for sale, over a hundred. Some .99 silver bitcoin limited edition coins are for sale in the museum. Then the trading bot that will be trading on cryptsy and bittrix. And we offer trading bot classes, with discounts on the licenses. So we can teach anyone how to integrate and operate a CAT trading bot. Its actually free money. We would like some wall art, as you can see it just looks like a brick vault. So donations are welcomed, and some have already offered to donate things to add to the display. Or stuff on co-signment would be great. But we are just going to see what happens and offer as much as we can.
@_date: 2014-10-26 04:16:23
We think about 128, but its obviously a beast to power. So not profitable anymore.
@_date: 2014-10-24 14:31:56
If amendment 2 passes on Nov 4th in Florida. It will be living a dream.
@_date: 2014-10-24 09:17:55
No, I know...and it is funny, but its things I enjoy. Thanks, good things
@_date: 2014-10-24 03:36:29
There is a sponsors page for donors who wish to display products, and help grow The Bitcoin Museum. Anything is appreciated. Feel free to sign up at the website for updates on exhibits and newly added items.
Located at:
MEDICAL MARIJUANA INSTITUTE OF TECHNOLOGY -BITCOIN MUSEUM                                                  
420 EAST S.R. 434
LONGWOOD, FL 32750 
Update: Just installed The Bitcoin Museum Trading Bot. Every time it dings, the museum gets a small donation.
We have submitted to google for google maps and placement. Now, Im trying to figure out how to add MMIT and the Bitcoin Museum to Coinmaps. We do computer services as well, so we would be the only computer company in Orlando listed on coinmaps.
EDIT: Frankenmint from bitcointalk listed The Bitcoin Museum on Coinmap.org. Thank you Frankenmint
We accept any crypto that can be exchanged, for any services or any of the classes we offer. 
Thank you  for donating a custom Bitcoin Museum wood wallet, soon to be on display.
@_date: 2014-10-24 04:33:50
Do you have a trading bot running on any exchange? Its free money, and we can get you a good deal on the APIs and what not.
@_date: 2014-10-24 04:30:21
No, thats the online museum. Ours is a brick and mortar school with a classroom for teaching bitcoin classes, and offices with bitcoin memorabilia on display. Some of the coins you can hold, and some are just for looking at. And we have some for sale.
@_date: 2014-10-24 04:26:08
Awesome, stop by in a few days once the bot is trading and the Titan is hashing. We were going to charge like 0.01403 btc, or just a small donation to keep the lights on and buy more btc stuff.
@_date: 2014-10-24 09:51:51
I got it, thanks so much. Ill have to figure out how to collect it now, haha. We do have a lot of that stuff too. And it will be on display very soon. Anyone can sign up on the website, and we will be adding pictures as we build it up. As you can see on the website, Ive started a little play by play. Thanks again! 
@_date: 2014-10-24 06:25:39
Yeah, it felt like fate as it was all coming together. Just hope it works out.
@_date: 2014-10-30 23:37:01
yeah, you would think someone would figure out a better system by now. 
@_date: 2014-10-26 01:30:41
You can check it out and sign up for updates and new exhibits. We will be adding virtual visiting as soon as its fully outfitted.
@_date: 2014-10-24 07:02:57
Thanks, fixed it. Throwing this thing together pretty quickly obviously.
@_date: 2014-10-26 04:08:46
Its an AMC Advanced Mining Technology...they were like a scam company but we bitched so much they finally sent something. So they essentially donated a great doorstop for the Bitcoin Musuem
@_date: 2014-11-07 03:37:20
Hey guys, I know most of you are aware of trading bots and what they do, and how they work. But if some of you were thinking about trying it out; we are offering a class, with a good price on 3 exchange APIs. Just trying to keep the lights on in The Bitcoin Museum. Thanks for your continued support guys and girls!
@_date: 2014-10-24 08:53:33
Thank you very much. I was a caregiver in Los Angeles for the past 10 years, so I moved back to hopefully continue the work here in Orlando. In the mean time, we decided to put this together. We just hope it passes, its going to be close. Yes on 2!
@_date: 2014-10-24 10:34:51
Definitely, if you can see in the pictures; we have peercoin, namecoin, cannabis coins. Anything cryptoor inspired by crypto,  is the same to me. Plus the doges community is strong and very giving. As long as have space, we want to add. We will stack high.
@_date: 2014-10-24 10:22:36
Give us a few days to outfit it with some more btc gear, then please come on by. 
@_date: 2014-10-31 00:04:15
Cool, thanks, I was thinking the same. I just dont have any expertise to base it on. Thanks for the appraisal.
@_date: 2014-10-24 08:55:49
Please do, thanks!
@_date: 2014-10-24 17:00:48
Why do you say that? Youre probably the fist out of thousands now to think so. 11,000 now to be exact...Which part is silly?
@_date: 2014-10-24 17:25:55
We arent getting any money, and its on the ballot in 2 weeks. And SB 1030 did pass. Google it dickhead
@_date: 2014-10-24 11:55:13
Yeah, I tried to count then multiply. In the weekends Id say 10 to 20,000. But on the weekdays during off hours its like 60 to 100 a minute. Its a big road with a lot of cars for sure.
@_date: 2014-10-25 01:45:05
Yeah, we would love to offer something like that. Just need a little more space and a steady revenue stream to keep the lights on.
@_date: 2014-10-24 04:28:12
Its BTC related stuff. We have miners from all eras. First edition Avalon, first edition blades, USBs for sale, a lot of other hashing miners. Neptunes, Titan, Gridseed, trading bots...and we would like to get some more stuff, and stuff to sell on cosignment from dealers if possible.
@_date: 2014-10-26 01:29:03
Yes, it is very real. And we are adding new bitcoin items everyday. 
MMIT- Bitcoin Museum
420 East S.R. 434
Longwood, FL 32750
@_date: 2014-10-24 14:08:40
Well I was in a hurry to find a place, and this isnt too far from UCF. But yeah, I wanted something that was closer to the beaches too. So this works for now. Of course Id like to expand. Just need to cover the overhead, and someone has to buy the lap dances for the big guy. Thanks for the support, and definitely come by when you can.
@_date: 2014-10-24 23:51:56
Great, please do 
@_date: 2014-10-26 08:57:35
Its all pretty cool, fun stuff. 
@_date: 2014-10-24 17:03:21
Yeah thats true, and one of the big things we are missing. Bitcoin wall art...
@_date: 2014-10-25 05:25:45
If you are the first one, yes we would print the blockchain transaction out and hang it in the museum. Like they do with dollar bills. Its good luck or something.
@_date: 2014-10-24 10:58:34
We actually dont, but I think we may get/make some for holiday stocking stuffers. We will get something like that up there. woodwallets.io is nice enough to give us a custom wood wallet to display. Thank you Nico!
@_date: 2014-11-03 18:05:53
Hey guys, tomorrow is the big vote for Medical Marijuana in Florida. We are trying to bring attention to bitcoin by appealing to people's desire to learn about new technology and businesses becoming available. If you have a second, please like our GOOGLE+ page so it will be easier for the masses to find The Bitcoin Museum, as well as the Medical Marijuana and bitcoin School on Google (   A big thanks to the guys at woodwallets.io for the very cool wood wallet now on display. 
It has been a very exciting week for The Bitcoin Museum. We had a fairly famous bitcoin millionaire stop by, and the Founder of a tech startup based in Austin, TX that was just bought in a multi-million dollar deal came through. He happened to be in Orlando, Fl and wanted to discuss bitcoin, and obviously we love to discuss bitcoin. He was an extremely intelligent person, and had some great ideas for the bitcoin space. Like a lot of people, he was trying to choose between the bitcoin movement and the medical marijuana movement. Obviously, we are qualified to give decent insight on both. 
Secondly, we are putting together some websites that would help cover the overhead of The Bitcoin Museum, and ideally expand. We dont want to ask for donations, so as long as we can support this ourselves; we plan to do so. We just ask for the support of the bitcoin community to help these possible revenue streams just by using the services that will be offered. More information to come. Thanks
@_date: 2014-10-26 03:54:50
Well right now its just a corporation that loves bitcoin. We are doing this with our own money. But if people really like the idea, and we can generate enough revenue to at least break even, we could turn it into a non profit. We are donating this space from our school where we teach classes on bitcoin. Right now a trading bot and miners are helping with the overhead.
@_date: 2014-10-24 14:10:35
We have a class for that
@_date: 2014-10-24 03:55:00
We are trying to raise money to fix this sign and make it all bitoin. Its 24hrs on and 20-30,000 cars a day, so we really want to get it made over.   
@_date: 2014-10-24 15:21:13
Yeah, that worried us too...so we got a great security system. 
@_date: 2014-11-06 12:03:29
Yeah, its a bummer...But we are going ahead as planned. It will be here by 2016, and we want to keep the museum open obviously.
