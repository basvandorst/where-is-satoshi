Im doing this also i buy/sell , and thats make me good profit to be honnest with you . 
And i never buy at market rate , always less than market rate . -10% or -15% . And sell above market 10% to 15% . Thats a 30% profit if i purchased lower by 15% and sell above 15% .
I was scammed first trade.  And the scammer scammed me with his own account with rating and everything . And that was the last time i was scammed , you just need to know the basics. And by the way I don't have any licenses . Because im just buying/selling online games money , why should i need a licence ? Bitcoin is made of thin air �� mr president .

Hello everyone , so in your case my friend .
The LBC account was hacked and sold on black market , the scammer who purchased this account use that LBC account with good transaction histort to scam people and getting costumers by an attractive rate . When the victime open a trade and try to sell btc the scammer transfer money from a hacked bank account to your own bank account its like money laundering and thats why your bank closed your account , they dont know that you just made a normal transaction but they think that you are hacking other bank accounts and dropping to your own account . They just didn't want to open a case on you because its the normal procedure. You are considered as a fraudster . 
Always request ID  with a note of date and time when accepting bank transfers .
Good luck
