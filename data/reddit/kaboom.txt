Because when your broke ass ends up in the ER it's us who will pay the bill. Have you ever heard of externalities?

The only thing kangaroo in this case was the defense. They stalled the trial, taunted the judge, pushed forward outrageous claims, avoided addressing many of the charges. And see how well this worked out? The jury handed out guilty verdicts practically as soon as they could. When the jury walks out of the deliberation room as quickly as they did, it points to an utter failure of the defense to even saw the smallest seed of a doubt.

Do you think it's a good time to buy now, Oliver? And how many bitcoins do you own?

Not having source control is a big plus if you are going to purposefully introduce backdoors to exploit.

They are blowing the money and probably betting on an acquisition before the money runs out.

Woah I thought we are going moon next week or next month at the latest but 3 DECADES! Madness!

What if in the future it becomes clear that increasing the total cap to let's say 30 million will benefit everyone?

Well then don't count on the frogs to help you when your ass is on the line.

Get out while you can.

Cut the BS, you want anonymous hosting for scam websites. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:42:36
That's a fair point.

If that makes you feel any better, I have been looking into shorting bitcoin for the last ten days, and the simple truth is there is no trustworthy brokerage that will do it. The ones that will are less than a year old, and look like a one-man operation with zero reputation. I am pretty sure that they will run away with the money at first opportunity. 
Also tried negotiating privately with some bitcoin holders that are otherwise very vocal, and guess how many bit ... Zero. Talk about putting your money where your mouth is.

And lived happily ever after. Amen.

 Yes that website looks like a paragon of trustworthiness. Two emails, no phone number, and a website in a "beta" mode.

Online commerce took off partly because people have reasonable protection against scams like this when using their credit card online. With BTC there is zero protection. Is there a way to implement chargebacks with bitcoins?

Look, I lived through the dot-com bubble, and people were saying the same thing about webvan and pets.com and all the other companies whose stock never recovered. I assure you back then it seemed impossible that a company that was once valuated for more than half a billion dollars will go bust in an eye-blink, but it happened to HUNDREDS of them.

The time scale is important, it took Apple 5 years to reach its peak while bitcoin did it in 5 days.

Charity organizations usually negotiate very low or no fee. 
@_date: 2013-04-06 16:55:55
Nobody charges back utility companies so this is not an incentive to accept BTC. Let's be realistic here.

My grocery store is processing more money than all of the bitpays put together. There has been no paradigm shift. Just a few starry eyed kids in denial. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 04:58:17
I think the nation state is ending bitcoin right now. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:23:16
Lol. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 05:40:13
Sometimes I feel that I live in a different dimension. Where do people like you come from? How is it possible to doubt that this is not a scam.

When Glen Back is on your side... Maybe you are on the wrong side.

No hurry, it would probably take at least a couple of days for the price to hit $30.
