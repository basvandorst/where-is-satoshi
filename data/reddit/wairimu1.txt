I'd like some magic internet money, please.
Btw if you're reading this, Satoshi, you are awesome.

Is it possible to block access to VPN's? I mean, it seems like they could stop transactions as well just by blocking access to VPN's.

Oops, I actually haven't purchased any yet, just speculating. Sorry! I assumed Paypal could be used :(

I didn't buy anything, so are they still required to do that?

But peers are on the WWW, not just directly connected to each other. It seems like the data can be intercepted and altered somehow.

Well, my gf is Chinese and she can confirm the legality of BTC in China. I think he is partly correct :)

Thanks for the info. I was also wondering how spying on data transfers can affect Bitcoin transactions. Are the data transfers encrypted?

wtf? I know that these trades need to be regulated but passport and other info is too invasive.

Thanks :)

I've been mining for about 4.5 hours. My Bitcoin balance under "personal assets" has finally changed after about 3 hours. Is it supposed to change in real time as I mine Bitcoins?

Help!
