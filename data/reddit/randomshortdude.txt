Nothing in there is anecdotal. I went to the points where people claim the dump happened and analyzed the volume, price movement and indicators and they don’t reflect any massive decline in price at the alleged times of the dumping. 
There’s nothing anecdotal about that.

“But you can’t deny it was a serious contributing factor” 
Yes, you can. You can look at the price at the alleged times that he supposedly dump and see clearly that this never happened because there wasn’t even a downtick in the price. The price of BTC had also already depreciated by 40% at the point of the first alleged dump

It got 1.8k views here and 10k views combined on other subs. It will be published in a big crypto publication tomorrow. 
I make about $10-15k/month writing articles like this and dissecting other facets of crypto currency. 
I really don’t give a fuck about how you feel, how this subreddit feels or operates or how anyone in this thread views it. 
Most of you don’t even have the intelligence required to digest anything I wrote in that article. I’d expect words like “fucking” to hurt your feelings. You’re a child. Curse words are still scary for you. 
Be honest with yourself, you never even looked into this issue. You read somewhere that the Mt. Gox bitcoins caused the dumping &amp; you assumed it was right without actually critically reviewing the claims. Now you’re mad because I actually did and that’s resulted in me exposing what an idiot you were. 
This feeling makes you uncomfortable and you start to doubt your own abilities to evaluate anything related to crypto. It makes you scared that you can’t tell your right hand from your ass hole &amp; then you lash out toward me as a result because you’re too underdeveloped as an adult to cope with this cognitive dissonance in a more mature fashion. 
I feel bad for you. You live in a fragile reality. That’s why you thrive in this community. You need people that spout the same copy/pasted, propaganda-Esque bullshit in order to validate your own beliefs. Without them, you’re alone and you can’t believe in shit by yourself because you never had a sack of nuts to do.

This theory doesn’t make any sense and it’s clear to me that people simply aren’t reading the article critically at all.

I'm already deconstructing this LOL

This may be one of the dumber responses I’ve ever received on anything I’ve written. 
And that’s saying a whole lot.

The frustrating level of stupidity that people respond to these articles with makes me pro-Gov Regulation TKS he max because idiots like you shouldn’t be allowed to invest. 
You all are like children in this sphere and that’s why the price is where it is. No one can tell anyone in crypto shit without someone calling it “FUD” or thinking you’re part of some conspiracy. As a result, you and a bunch of other morons blew the top off the price at $20k - where it was clearly fucking overvalued. 
There’s nothing that fundamentally changed about Bitcoin from the price of $4k to $20k to give it such a valuation. 
But you don’t listen to logic. You think me saying that means “FUD! He hates Bitcoin!” , when it really just means that there was no justifiable market logic for the increase. It was exuberant and the price had been in correction for a couple months now. 
I could give a fuck if it goes to $50,000 tomorrow. I make good money and I don’t have a lot invested into this space. I’m not controlled by greed like you &amp; most people are. 
You just think everyone’s in a conspiracy against Bitcoin because you think everyone is as greedy as you are. 
“oh you must have a short”. 
No, I have a fucking brain. The evidence on there is clear.

Miners are not driving the market down. I was simply making the point that the market withstands much greater selling power than what an alleged 8,000 BTC dump would bring and mining is our evidence of that.

“I’m not smart enough to engage the comment and actually formulate real criticism so I’ll just say something generic to fit in with the crowd!” 
I’m not mad at you. That’s weak minded sheep are forced to do. Yell out “FUD!” Or “Yeah, makes no sense!” 
What’s fluff? What would be considered not fluff? Do you even know? 
It’s a 2,700 word article. That’s a lot of fluff

Everything I wrote in the article is right and no one has proved me wrong yet. I posted this here because I wanted to touch nerves. 
Best written article on LN in the entire space.

The irony here is at peak levels
