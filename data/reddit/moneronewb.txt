This response does not even come close to answering my question.

That's what I don't understand, how can he be an enemy of bitcoin if he has $100s of millions in bitcoin? That doesn't make sense to me.

Thanks for this.
Here's what I don't get though -- you (and many others) are making the case that Roger Ver is only it it for himself (e.g. pumps alts he owns, Mt Gox ordeal, etc.). So in short you're saying he's self-interested to the point that he puts his own needs above others, even when other people may be harmed in the process of meeting his needs.
But this is where the argument stops making sense to me -- so he's extremely self-interested, and therefore he's proposing something that would be harmful to the network and his personal massive BTC fortune??
If he's primarily motivated by growing and maintaining his own wealth, why would he put his entire fortunate at risk for some personal vendetta against Core?

Because I didn't realize as many people hate Gregory Maxwell as hate Roger Ver

Can you (or anyone else) explain in layman's terms, without ad hominem attacks, why there is so much hatred for Roger Ver's scaling proposal?
Pretend you're explaining it to someone who doesn't live and breath bitcoin all day long.
As someone only somewhat familiar with bitcoin, I have a hard time understanding why there's so much hatred for someone who (ostensibly) has a massive portion of his net worth in bitcoin, why wouldn't his interests be aligned with the majority of bitcoin holders (hodlers as you guys say)?
