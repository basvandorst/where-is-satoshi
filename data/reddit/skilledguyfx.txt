Dunno. Anyway, I've proved that this account is mine, but they still keep it frozen. 
@_date: 2018-09-26 14:04:37
It's really hard to be exaggerating when CS just simply ignore you. I would be happy to keep everything private and talk to you directly but as I see your support team are not willing to cooperate with me further. 
As I mentioned previously we were in contact and right after I provided all my documents, talked via video call and etc they simply disappeared. And my last 3 messages left unattended 
@_date: 2018-09-26 14:07:14
Thanks for support! And be careful with your money on exchanges
@_date: 2018-09-18 11:57:22
I totally agree, I’m trying to make it public. Do you know the best way? And also, do you remember where that post was, it might be good to get in touch with that person.
@_date: 2018-09-18 13:33:03
I hope so! I don't know why they are not able to reactivate my account! It's really terrible situation.
@_date: 2018-09-18 13:46:38
Exactly, but this situation directly refers to Binance's reputation.
@_date: 2018-09-26 18:09:29
Thanks for sharing my previously posts! There's a lot of screenshots and proofs 
And you will never know if Binance can ask you for a Skype call or not. But I know that they can
@_date: 2018-09-26 16:02:52
I guess a cold storage is the best way to keep your private keys safe but it's not that convenient (for me personally) 
@_date: 2018-09-26 15:35:07
No, they didn't ask me to pay to fix my problem. They requested only documents, information about funds, ip addresses etc and video Skype call.
I'm just surprised to learn that they asked you to pay for your account. Seems strange. 
@_date: 2018-09-26 16:17:18
I guess it was the best decision from your side to keep your money.
@_date: 2018-09-18 12:27:43
I'm just worried if my funds are really safe! 
@_date: 2018-09-18 13:51:06
They do. Such companies rarely make such calls/interviews, however, in some cases it is necessary. Ask anyone who has 3rd verification level or any other privileges and they'll prove that they talk to their personal managers using the channels that user prefers. 
@_date: 2018-09-18 13:30:51
Yes, I'll fight till the end. Trust me
@_date: 2018-09-26 16:11:51
Will you write about my issue? If so please, pm me and I'll provide you all necessary proofs.
@_date: 2018-09-18 13:28:39
@_date: 2018-09-18 13:47:48
Sure, I use different emails for personal and assets-related goals. It's a rule that can't be ignored. 
@_date: 2018-09-26 16:05:19
It's not my first post here and in the previous one I shared a lot of screenshots of our Skype and email conversation. 
@_date: 2018-09-26 16:06:37
Everybody knows the issues with Poloniex. But not with the Binance. I don't want to wait 5 months to see my funds unblocked.
@_date: 2018-09-26 14:08:09
It's one of the biggest exchange so far and I thought it's one of the trusted and reputable...but not
@_date: 2018-09-26 15:48:03
Thanks! I hope they at least respond to my last few messages
@_date: 2018-09-26 15:32:18
1 - The account was 3'd level verified and the withdrawal amount was up to 100 Bitcoins
2 - No
3 - I always use VPN ( but all IP addresses were from 1 country). I mentioned it during the call with Binance representatives
4 - No. All my deposits and withdrawals were from the public sources.
@_date: 2018-09-18 13:29:54
Yes, they ask for a vide call and there were several people during our talk. I showed them additional documents and etc. The thing is that my account is still blocked.
@_date: 2018-09-18 14:50:36
Who those who asked about email header
@_date: 2018-10-04 15:25:02
If I was under investigation by law enforcement I'll be connected directly by law enforcement about my account issue.
Otherwise seems like Binance just to stole my money as their last message in their subreddit was
"As detailed in the support ticket, the account is under investigation and cannot be released until the investigation is complete. During this time, Binance does guarantee the security of the account’s assets."
Sounds bad especially when your account is full of 1200BTC 
@_date: 2018-10-04 19:21:36
I don't understand why are you still thinking that I was phished. Even when official Binance representative left a comment here.
You can see all screenshot etc that proves that I wasn't phished.
P.S. or you are Binance troll
@_date: 2018-10-05 13:17:32
Lawyer was hired!
@_date: 2018-10-04 20:08:16
The thing is that only after my reddit posts they starting reply me properly and ofter. Before 3-5 my messages could remain without any attention
@_date: 2018-10-04 18:55:22
Haven't you seen his comment?
I already hired a lawyer but make situation like this public is one of the best way to influence on such structure as Binance.
I don't think that's really LE behind them, no. They are just manipulating
@_date: 2018-10-04 17:38:08
it's Binance fooling people! I don't kknow why they did this but you can see everything on my image (header, binance email etc)
@_date: 2018-10-05 13:12:25
Binance is one of the biggest cryptcurrency exchanges. I mean it's obvious that I trusted them
@_date: 2018-10-05 12:01:15
I'm thinking about move to public but I started from a lawyer 
@_date: 2018-10-06 14:34:23
Just want to clarify situation with the screenshot
That's how your message looks on my computer: [
The language of my computer is German
@_date: 2018-10-04 18:31:42
Hm....Here's Binance representative. you can ask him directly if it's possible or not
My answer - It's possible
@_date: 2018-10-05 11:15:18
Why do you thing that this is commies? Probably because you didn't loose all of your money?
This is not a joke! That's why I made it public
@_date: 2018-10-04 18:21:26
I would be happy if Binance give me any worth feedback
@_date: 2018-10-05 13:19:02
@_date: 2018-10-04 18:20:25
Thanks for sharing your answer here as well! My screenshot was real and I hope you don't try to cheat and just provided a screen from another ticket.
@_date: 2018-10-02 17:30:05
My account "activation request" was official declined on their official website and a reason they requested a video call. My account is still frozen
@_date: 2018-10-05 08:00:16
Just interesting why I should deserve it?
You comment based on nothing
@_date: 2018-10-05 06:59:39
Thanks for sharing! 
But I'm acting according to my lawyer suggestion and he sure that there's no LE behind me.
But anyway! Happy to get a support
@_date: 2018-10-05 06:56:45
Thanks for support! 
@_date: 2018-10-05 11:50:07
When you do an arbitrage you have to keep all your money on exchanges it's a part of a traders life.
@_date: 2018-10-02 17:25:36
I'm absolutely sure that I wasn't phished! 
The first reply was from their official website after I left a request and as you may see the whole communication goes through their official domain address.
I showed them regular documents that could be requested by exchange. 
@_date: 2018-10-05 08:16:52
Thanks for suggestion
@_date: 2018-10-05 08:14:43
I'm trying to reach Binance via different channels! Not only Reddit
But anyway, Thanks for suggestion
@_date: 2018-10-04 15:21:44
Thanks you very much! 
I already hired a lawyer and I hope it'll help! but, community as well as Binace should know that I'm not going to stop! 
@_date: 2018-10-05 06:12:05
I trusted them for a long time before this situation.
@_date: 2018-10-04 16:18:27
Well, The thing is right after his answer he blocked thread
Secondly he blame me about fake screenshot that's not true! I can provide a video where I can prove that the screenshot is real
He made only one statement that worth to be placed everywhere
"As detailed in the support ticket, the account is under investigation and cannot be released until the investigation is complete. During this time, Binance does guarantee the security of the account’s assets."
@_date: 2018-10-05 06:24:08
You can think whatever you want but my all of my screenshots is real. 
If you are Binance oriented customer nothing will change your opinion.
But my truth is one and only real that exist for now.
Think. For what do I need to change a content on screenshot if the main idea is the same. Just a few words were changed that acting "not professional" from the Binance side and I absolutely sure that they did this. Think about it
@_date: 2018-10-04 17:29:01


Traders Weekdays
@_date: 2018-10-04 20:06:44
At least they stopped ignore me
@_date: 2018-10-07 18:57:10
I just don't understand the point how incognito window connected to my funds?
I always use incognito windows.
@_date: 2018-10-04 17:57:24
Hmm...intersting to know what's not BS for you
@_date: 2018-10-04 20:28:50
If there's any lawyer who will agree to work this way?
@_date: 2018-10-04 19:24:19
What if not? Long will be such "investigation"? 
Right after my first Binance post at least I receive an answer form their side.
So, I don't see any reason to stop
@_date: 2018-10-05 11:16:05
nice joke! but anyway - not recommended 
@_date: 2018-10-04 18:24:19
Why you are so negative to me? You can't blame me for holding money on exchange while I'm doing arbitrage
@_date: 2018-10-04 15:27:41
AS I told before it's an arbitrage bro
@_date: 2018-10-04 18:26:49
Probably you can tell me what should I do?
When a lot of your money are frozen you'll do everything that somehow could help you with this situation. 
Go to the Lawyer, make a story public etc.
That's exactly what i do
@_date: 2018-10-05 13:17:20
I guess I provided a million screenshots in my previous threads that prove my legit.
Binance confirmed it as well. Or what kind of proof do you expect?
@_date: 2018-10-04 18:25:25
As I told before many times I don't think that my account is under investigation at all
@_date: 2018-10-05 06:57:12
Poloniex is one of my exchange already
@_date: 2018-10-04 17:31:14
They told me that they are Asian exchange based somewhere in Hong-Kong. Don't know where is a truth
@_date: 2018-10-05 07:31:30
Thanks for sharing your opinion
As I know if there was real LE they will never tell me about it as it's prohibited that why I'm so confused, moreover e requested all my documents but they are not able to use it or disclose my personal information to the third parties. 
That's why I'm so confused about Binance behavior.
They told me a several different reasons why my account was blocked. and I provided everything to prove that my funds area legal and I'm legal as well.
I received a proper answer form their support team only after I published it on reddit. So, I have reasons to trust Binance anymore, unfortunately
I'll write a huge post if i get my money back but for now I really doubt about it.
@_date: 2018-10-04 16:33:10
I bought everything on top-5 exchanges via verified accounts
@_date: 2018-10-04 15:26:03
I also think that they locked my account to simply use my money! 
There's no any "security" or any other reason block me. 
@_date: 2018-10-04 18:05:34
I think they do
@_date: 2018-10-04 16:09:04
They do skype call! It calls video verification. Even the official Binance representative can prove it here. As he's in this thread responding to my messages.
Ask him directly before claiming me
@_date: 2018-10-05 13:12:43
1.2K BTC
@_date: 2018-10-02 17:14:41
They lied to em about a real cause of blocking of my account for a 3 weeks.
And I asked them to connect me with the law enforcement and they didn't do it and even didn't explain me why. 
I provided them all my documents, talked with their representative via Skype. 
They asked everything but it hardly connected to the law enforcement. 
@_date: 2018-10-05 06:51:59
Oh...No! the account was stolen by Binance representatives
@_date: 2018-10-04 20:54:09
I don't see any reasons in your words not to believe me 
@_date: 2018-10-04 18:24:47
Thanks! I'm absolutely agree
@_date: 2018-10-05 08:12:26
@_date: 2018-10-05 13:10:34
Social networks in work! 
@_date: 2018-10-04 15:27:21
When you do an arbitrage it's necessary to keep money on exchanges. I have more than 5 accounts on top 5 exchanges and I never faced with same problem before. That's ridiculous 
@_date: 2018-10-05 06:57:58
@_date: 2018-10-05 11:19:17
Here's a proof
@_date: 2018-10-05 07:45:54
If it would be a shit than Biannce representative will never reply to this thread with the confirmation message
@_date: 2018-11-08 11:10:30
Thanks for your support. 
@_date: 2018-11-02 11:28:40
So what? I'm not a native speaker, but does it stop me from being a trader? As even Binance's english is a way less native than mine.
Moreover, where have you seen anything about the police investigation? Please, define police, legal structures and internal investigations. 
@_date: 2018-11-01 14:02:28
Thanks for your support. But as said earlier, I was keeping such amount on the exchange for the only reason - fast access for the arbitrage trading. 
@_date: 2018-11-02 10:29:27
The thing is that they do not share any additional info via email, and they keep silent, despite the fact that my locked account has more than 15% of their trading volume.
@_date: 2018-11-01 16:18:30
Well, I don't think that Binance doesn't have enough BTC or USD, as it is one of the most promising exchanges. 
@_date: 2018-11-23 10:45:28
Hey there,
I've mentioned in my previous posts that my computer system just automatically translates texts so there are maybe a few words that aren’t the same but the meaning wasn’t changed at all so the difference in wording is totally obsolete.
Thanks for your support so much!
@_date: 2018-11-02 10:42:42
They never shared a reason of blocking, as well as they never persuaded me to contact LLE, it was just a suggestion. 
@_date: 2018-11-01 15:32:07
Hey, why are you feeling so negative about my situation?
@_date: 2018-11-02 10:16:33
Thanks for your support. 
@_date: 2018-11-02 11:29:59
I've hired a lawyer to compile the necessary documents to start a legal issue.
@_date: 2018-11-01 12:14:26
Unfortunately, funds are not SAFU.
@_date: 2018-11-01 17:01:12
Why do you find it scam?
@_date: 2018-11-22 13:04:02
Thanks so much, really appreciated.
@_date: 2018-11-22 15:09:48
I see your position. Despite you don't sympathy for my situation, the case shouldn't be ignored, as it influences on the entire crypto market.
@_date: 2018-11-01 15:29:27
Thanks for your reply, but it's not making me closer to the locked funds, as you're not providing me with any ETA or any other data. What is the reason of the investigation? When is it going to end? Why are you keeping my funds locked instead of taking any actions? Please, respond me here or via email, as it's going nowhere. A lot of people are aware of my issue, and I'm not sure that it makes a positive contribution to your reputation.
@_date: 2018-11-02 10:44:42
That sounds like a plan!
@_date: 2018-11-29 14:07:33
Agreed, but keeping the funds on exchange is the only option to trade fast, as you're constantly buying assets on one exchange and selling them on another.
Trading isn't the only thing that gives me money, however, it's more than possible to live on profit made by arbitrage trading.
@_date: 2018-11-29 14:25:48
Why do you still use cryptocurrency? Haven't it brought at least some profit to you?
@_date: 2018-11-07 16:21:33
Hey, thanks for you comment and support. Actually, I don't know any reasons to suspect my account in anything that should be considered as fraudulent activity. No one had an access to the account except me. 
@_date: 2018-11-02 10:05:20
Everyone who's using an exchange platform takes the risk, but such processes shouldn't last so long. 
@_date: 2018-11-02 11:22:26
I totally agree with you about keeping the assets on your end, not on the exchange, but it's only possible if you are holding, but not trading.
@_date: 2018-11-22 13:49:53
Hey, thanks for you comment.
Actually, I'm not sure that it is possible. Despite the fact that I'd love get my account unblocked, bribing is the worst way to make it happen, and I don't want to be associated with such activity. I'd like this issue to be solved in general order. 
@_date: 2018-11-07 19:21:40
No, they have suspected the suspicious login attempts, at least they said it.
@_date: 2018-11-01 15:31:14
Hey, it's still not solved. No changes since then. 
@_date: 2018-11-22 17:10:27
Thanks for your support!
@_date: 2018-11-07 12:24:55
Hi! It was proven that I didn't alter my email and I do have a lawyer
@_date: 2018-11-02 10:30:53
That could be funny, but I'm not that guy. 
@_date: 2018-11-07 12:54:59
I didn't alter my email, it was the same text but the computer auto-translated it. The meaning of the email was the same.
@_date: 2018-11-02 10:23:46
Hey, kindly read the full story from scratch and Binance's response one more time. I do not have an access to my account. 
@_date: 2018-11-29 14:13:55
Well, I would agree with you at some point, but the situation lasts for so long without any progress. The other thing that confuses me a lot is that none of the other exchanges from top 10 haven't frozen my account and/or had questions about it, and I'm sure that they also have different kind of regular examinations of the coins that a user holds.  
@_date: 2018-11-01 15:30:31
Actually, there are a lot of traders who do the same, but I never thought this could happen to Binance. 
@_date: 2018-11-01 14:08:05
That sounds quite interesting. I think that some exchanges might have such practice, but I never even thought that such may happen to Binance. 
@_date: 2018-11-01 12:20:57
Unfortunately, my citizenship doesn't match with the counties of Binance's offices. Sure, I've contacted with the attorney, and there are final preparations of the necessary documents to submit them for the legal issue. 
@_date: 2018-11-02 10:03:23
They were not given that way. They were placed to make some activity by my side, but it was not a present for Binance. 
@_date: 2018-11-02 10:34:12
The investigation has taken its place a long before I've admitted that not all of the funds belong to me, so it doesn't make sense. 
@_date: 2018-11-08 11:07:55
Thanks for your comment.
In our correspondence that you are pointing to, you haven't mentioned anything related to the suspicion of fraudulent activity, in fact you actually told me you weren't at liberty to disclose simply any details at any time. So why now is it suddenly under a fraud investigation? Is that not a new detail? 
And as I have already stated, the screenshots weren't altered. My computer auto-translates messages and for that reason it's exactly the same as the original but I'd really like for you to point out to me where there's a difference in meaning because to me it appears they say the exact same thing but maybe I'm wrong. 
@_date: 2018-11-01 15:21:09
Thanks so much for your support!
@_date: 2018-11-02 10:49:31
Being careful with all of the paperwork and paying taxes in time frees you up from any problems. 
@_date: 2018-11-07 14:57:37
I know but any help helps!
@_date: 2018-11-23 10:42:36
Hello As I have stated many times before, my computer system just automatically translates texts so there are maybe a few words that aren’t the same but the meaning wasn’t changed at all so the difference in wording is totally obsolete. 
@_date: 2018-11-01 16:55:35
Thanks a lot, I'll definitely let you know.
@_date: 2018-11-07 16:18:20
I know that they're not able just to unlock my account immediately, however, I do believe that making such posts makes me closer to the solution, as Binance really value their reputation, and it's possible for them to speed up this process. 
@_date: 2018-11-07 13:16:18
I don't see any link between Binance's responsibility to it's users and my computer system. 
@_date: 2018-11-02 10:40:30
Following this logic, no one should share their opinion. This is a stagnation.
@_date: 2018-11-01 14:23:39
As well as the arbitrage traders. 
@_date: 2018-11-02 10:15:57
At least Binance is able to share any info regarding the investigation with me. And, not, Binance never persuaded me to contact with LLE, they only suggest me to do that if I consider the investigation unwarranted. 
@_date: 2018-11-08 11:11:49
I'm working with the lawyer, and, as mentioned earlier, he's ending the preparation of the documents for the legal action.
@_date: 2018-11-01 13:06:51
The thing is not all of the funds on this account was mine, that's the biggest issue. I wasn't keeping all of the funds on this exchange, but still it's a huge loss. I really find your arguments very strong, but the market shouldn't work that way. 
@_date: 2018-11-02 10:25:14
Thanks a lot. I'm glad that there are a lot of people who understand that Binance's message worth nothing.
@_date: 2018-11-29 15:54:55
I only used to trade with that funds.
@_date: 2018-11-01 13:01:28
There are final preparations of the documents for the legal issue. 
@_date: 2018-11-01 15:19:33
The only fishy thing here is the reason of keeping my funds locked. As you can see above, Binance does not deny the fact that my account with 1,2K is locked and the funds are held by the exchange. The "soon resolution" that they have promised hasn't still been achieved, neither my account was unlocked. 
@_date: 2018-11-01 12:44:50
Thanks so much! I'll definitely keep you posted.
@_date: 2018-11-07 12:46:14
Hi! What's really fishy is that Binance won't tell me why my funds are locked. 
@_date: 2018-11-07 12:59:10
Thanks for the advice! I'll definitely try to get his attention and help. 
@_date: 2018-11-01 12:25:01
If you are hodling any currency, sure, you have to keep the assets on your end. My case is different, as I need a constant access for the funds for trading.
@_date: 2018-11-01 14:09:53
Already found, hope that he'll handle it.
@_date: 2018-11-02 10:43:45
Please, read the story from scratch. I'm not holding BTC, but trading. 
@_date: 2018-11-02 11:24:12
Exactly. 
@_date: 2018-11-01 13:00:47
I would agree with you in some point, however, it doesn't lead the entire industry to its main goals. Such occasions only prove that the market is too young, and we really need decentralised exchanges. 
@_date: 2018-11-23 10:34:58
Thanks so much for your support! I also hope that my issue may aware more cryptoheads from the same issue.
@_date: 2018-11-23 10:32:49
Hello there. I do have a lawyer, and this in not a shitpost. I'm just trying to get more people from the entire crypto community aware of my issue. 
@_date: 2018-11-01 12:08:11
Thanks for support! 
@_date: 2018-11-01 12:13:17
Exactly. That would be just great.
@_date: 2018-11-02 10:36:45
Kindly point to any fishy things associated with my account. The main thing which I really don't understand is a lack of their communication. They keep silent and never share any additional info.

Why do you feel so negative about my situation?
@_date: 2018-11-22 13:51:39
Hey, why do you feel so negative about my situation? Everyone earns money the way he can, so I am earning the funds via trading. I've also mentioned earlier that not all of the funds on the account were mine, some of them were borrowed at interest. 
@_date: 2018-11-01 15:22:41
I have no idea about the investigation that Binance is talking about. If I knew about it, I wouldn't make such posts. 
@_date: 2018-11-22 15:34:15
Well, you are right at some point. But why do you still use crypto then? 
@_date: 2018-11-02 11:21:13
I do have a lawyer, and, again, he sees nothing bad in posting such stories, as it may speed up the process.
@_date: 2018-11-01 15:14:36
There were no market manipulation and/or laundered money. I'm in crypto since the very beginning, so there's nothing strange in having such amounts
@_date: 2018-11-01 16:29:03
We'll see.
@_date: 2018-11-01 15:33:44
I wish I knew the reason of the investigation, but they keep silent. Thanks for your support!
@_date: 2018-11-07 11:57:48
Unfortunately,  I'm not in the same country as any of the Binance offices, so I don't think it can be. How did your friend resolve his situation? Or did he just lose all his money?
@_date: 2018-11-02 10:39:04
Thanks for your comment, totally agreed. 
@_date: 2018-11-22 14:09:46
Yes, I had to do this for an arbitrage trading. 
@_date: 2018-11-02 10:44:15
Certainly no. But it seems that they did it.
@_date: 2018-11-01 16:29:44
Binance wasn't the only exchange that I am using for such needs, but anyways, thanks for your suggestion. 
@_date: 2018-11-01 13:35:36
I heard about Bisq, but there are few points why I'm not using decentralised exchanges at the moment: low volume and limited amount of supported assets.
@_date: 2018-11-01 16:32:59
Basically, there are two groups of BTC owners: holders and traders. Traders often store their BTC on the exchange, in order to access their funds fast.
@_date: 2018-11-01 14:21:45
Thanks for your comment. While the lawyer is about to end the preparation of the documents to submit a legal procedure, I see nothing bad in making such posts, as I'm only letting more people know that an exchange may easily lock their funds without any reason. 
@_date: 2018-11-07 13:46:02
Hi, I've previously stated that the screenshots weren't altered, but that my computer auto-translates messages and for that reason it's not like the original but you can see that the messages are one and the same.
@_date: 2018-11-01 14:03:12
Agreed. Thanks for sharing your opinion. 
@_date: 2018-11-01 15:11:09
Dear Binance representative,
Could you please give me any timeframes of the investigation of this case? My funds are still locked, and I don't have any access to them. I'd be glad if you share any additional info, as I'm lost in doubts. Please, shed a light on this issue. If you need any additional info from my side, don't hesitate to ask for it. I really need an access to the locked funds. Thanks in advance. 
@_date: 2018-11-02 11:23:53
Thanks a lot for your support. 
@_date: 2018-11-02 10:47:45
That's not a goddamn reason. 
@_date: 2018-11-07 12:57:48
All of the money is mine in responsibility, but some of it was borrowed, and I've written and told this in other posts. All of the money is my responsibility.
@_date: 2018-11-02 11:30:27
Exactly. 
@_date: 2018-11-07 13:35:38
I do have a lawyer! I'm just trying to bring awareness to the situation.
@_date: 2018-11-01 16:30:57
Hey there, I've already hired a lawyer, and there's a final preparation of the documents. 
@_date: 2018-11-22 14:10:57
I'm not asking you to care for it. Moreover, I just can not understand where have you found anything related to greed? 
@_date: 2018-11-01 13:44:19
The thing is that they do not share this info, maybe that's why I was advised to contact LLE. I'd be glad to know   why and who is investigating my account, but they do not let me to do it. Hope that the attorney will be able to get this info. 
@_date: 2018-11-01 17:12:43
I've already contacted an attorney, so I'm waiting for the documents to be submitted for the legal action.
@_date: 2018-11-01 13:25:18
Thanks for your opinion. Despite the fact that Binance was doubt about some of my screenshots, they have never denied the fact that my account with 1,2k BTC balance was frozen, because I do own(ed) them. They also have never shared a reason here in reddit or with me in PM. The fact is it lasts for so long, and there were no movements done from their side, which really makes them shady.
@_date: 2018-11-01 15:34:59
That would be amazing. Thanks for the kind words! 
@_date: 2018-11-07 13:13:35
As I've said many times, it IS my money. I am the person responsible for it all so it's MY money. And again, as I've mentioned, I DO have a lawyer. This is an actual problem for me. I'm posting so it doesn't happen to anyone else.
@_date: 2018-11-29 14:15:05
Do you really think that it is mine fault, but not Binance's failure? 
@_date: 2018-11-02 10:26:51
Well, my lawyer doesn't have anything against posting such materials. In the meantime, it may speed up the process of their investigation, as it influences on their reputation. 
@_date: 2018-11-07 14:56:45
What do you mean? The money is my responsibility. I'm using it for arbitrage and it was known by the people I borrowed from. I'm not using it for online shopping like it's my money but I am responsible for it all. How would you rather me call it?
@_date: 2018-11-01 17:03:20
How are you going to spend it?
@_date: 2018-11-02 10:47:25
- They do not persuade me to contact LLE
- Police can not lock your funds
But thanks for your support. 
@_date: 2018-12-05 12:29:23
Thanks for your interest. I'll definitely keep you updated. 
@_date: 2018-12-05 16:06:26
Not at all, as these funds were used for an arbitrage trading.
@_date: 2018-12-05 16:50:06
Thanks for your support! I'll keep you posted.
@_date: 2018-12-05 15:37:23
Thanks for your comment! I hope that my situation will be finally solved. I'll keep you posted. 
@_date: 2018-12-05 15:40:42
Nope, it wasn't. I only used these funds for an arbitrage trading, that's all.
@_date: 2018-12-05 16:07:27
Thanks for your comment. I've mentioned in my previous posts that my computer system just automatically translates texts so there are maybe a few words that aren’t the same but the meaning wasn’t changed at all so the difference in wording is totally obsolete. Just take a look at the texts and compare them.
@_date: 2018-12-05 11:58:29
I'd prefer not to do that, at least for now. I'll definitely post them in the case the legal issue brings me nowhere. 
@_date: 2018-12-05 12:02:47
Thanks a lot for your support. I agree with you, but such things shouldn't happen when we are speaking about such exchange. At least I thought that there won't be a lack of communication from Binance's side.
@_date: 2018-12-05 15:47:01
Thanks for your comment. While Binance's representatives have publicly pointed at very weak arguments like "altered screenshots" (they weren't it was an auto-translator), they haven't declined the fact of ownership of ≈1200 BTC. I don't want to scam Binance (conversely, it seems that they've scammed me), I just want to get my funds back.
@_date: 2018-12-05 17:11:10
I hope not.
@_date: 2018-12-05 17:15:14
Thanks so much, really appreciated!
@_date: 2018-12-05 17:09:10
Yes, but I didn't even expected that such situation may happen with Binance.
@_date: 2018-12-05 15:42:53
Agreed, but the exchange shouldn't work that way, should they? 
@_date: 2018-12-05 16:12:06
Hey there. Unfortunately, Binance was never transparent about this case, as they don't share any details that I need. 
@_date: 2018-12-05 15:28:31
Already have a lawyer, just wanted more people to know that anyone could face the same issue.
@_date: 2018-12-05 16:25:48
Thanks so much for your support! Unfortunately, nothing has changed since then, and it seems that Binance just doesn't want to solve my problem.
@_date: 2018-12-05 16:20:09
Hey there! I wish I knew those reasons, but I did nothing that can be considered as "fraudulent" activity or related to AML. Sure, I am able to prove the source of funds, as the blockchain allows me to do so. It wouldn't be hard to explain at all.
@_date: 2018-12-05 16:13:26
Agreed. Thanks for sharing your opinion!
@_date: 2018-12-05 11:59:18
Do you have any personal accounts of CZ?
@_date: 2018-12-05 16:24:54


And I'm sure that this was a huge mistake, as I did everything correct. Again, none of the other top exchanges hasn't frozen my account, despite there were almost the same amounts of funds.
@_date: 2018-12-05 17:17:15
Hey there, thanks for your support. 
If you don't trade very often, just keep your funds on a cold wallet/hardware one, and you shouldn't have such issues.
@_date: 2018-12-05 12:39:23
Thanks a lot.
@_date: 2018-12-05 17:17:50
The only reason for keeping such amount of BTC on exchange is the arbitrage trading.
@_date: 2018-12-05 16:31:25
@_date: 2018-12-05 12:01:04
Not yet, but I can't wait to make it happen. The preparations of all of the necessary documents, as well as searching for a proper jurisdiction is a very complicated process. 
@_date: 2018-12-05 16:12:16
Exactly, thanks a lot.
@_date: 2018-12-05 11:55:42
I have no clue, there are no updates from their side.
@_date: 2018-12-05 11:54:53
I used to keep such amounts for the arbitrage trading.
@_date: 2018-12-05 17:14:54
Thanks so much for your support!
@_date: 2018-12-05 16:26:52
Thanks so much! Actually, I haven't performed any illegal stuff, and I do have a lawyer who holds the entire process.
@_date: 2018-12-05 11:57:35
I had to keep them on the exchange, as only that way one can make profit on the price difference.  
@_date: 2018-12-05 15:41:56
I think it would be great if there was a pre-check procedure for deposits, not for withdrawals only.
@_date: 2018-12-05 16:08:14
Thanks a lot for your comment. Agreed, it takes a lot of time even to compile all of the documents.
@_date: 2018-12-05 16:17:22
Hi there, I'm glad that you now remember me. Actually, there are a lot of people who care about my situation, just take a look through the entire thread. Moreover, I did nothing that could be considered as "dodgy" or "shady". I'll stop posting as soon as Binance will unblock my account and let me finally withdraw my funds. Thanks.
@_date: 2018-12-05 15:40:05
I haven't performed anything illegal with these funds, I only used them for an arbitrage trading between top-10 exchanges, and none of them (except Binance) has frozen my accounts.
@_date: 2018-12-05 15:31:01
I've mentioned in my previous posts that my computer system just automatically translates texts so there are maybe a few words that aren’t the same but the meaning wasn’t changed at all so the difference in wording is totally obsolete. Just take a look at the texts and compare them.
@_date: 2018-12-05 17:14:40
Thanks so much for sharing your opinion. Actually, I had no issues at all with the other top exchanges, and finally got my funds locked on Binance. So I didn't expect to have that issue, as I have provided them with all the necessary documents. 
@_date: 2018-12-05 12:28:19
I'm trying to reach them via all of the channels I know. By making such posts on reddit I just want to get more people know about my issue, as well as to bring Binance's attention to it, as only this way they may find out that there are some reputation risks.
@_date: 2018-12-05 15:34:22
I have the same concerns, and Binance still haven't provided me with any concrete info. 
Appreciate your opinion!
@_date: 2018-12-05 16:22:01
Thanks, that's it.
@_date: 2018-12-05 12:46:29
Thanks a lot for your support! 
@_date: 2018-12-05 16:21:42
Thanks a lot for your support!
Just a small piece of info: lots of institutional traders/investors keep their funds on exchange (despite lots of them decline this fact), as it's the only way to trade as fast as possible.
@_date: 2018-12-05 16:29:20
My lawyer covers the entire process, but it takes a lot of time.
@_date: 2018-12-05 16:50:25
You're right, thanks.
@_date: 2018-12-05 16:30:59
There was no fraud, I only used these funds for an arbitrage trading.
@_date: 2018-12-05 16:30:19
I wasn't. Why have you decided that I was? Again, I only used this account for an arbitrage trading, so there is nothing that can be considered as "fraud".
@_date: 2018-12-05 15:31:16
Exactly. Thanks a lot.
@_date: 2018-12-05 16:14:53
Yes, because of the arbitrage needs.
@_date: 2018-12-05 17:11:53
Agreed, but that's the only way to store the coins for the arbitrage needs. 
@_date: 2018-12-05 16:05:32
Well, I don't agree that posting here on Reddit will have zero affect, as there are a lot of people who were able to see my issue and disagree with Binance's position.
