Thats why they have automatic systems for this. Employees only need to check possible flags.

Ah so nice. Reminds me of the 2nd world war where the turkish collaborated with the nazi's.

What has this to do with your nationality? Don't pull that card fellow Indian. I call it a scam because anonymous and without a name/representative organisation.

Lol but thanks to the Germans and the French we have a very intrusive P2SD-thingy now. Long live the EU.

Good luck in solving your problems fellow crypto man.

How to look like a complete idiot on social media.

And the EU.

"BTC is as good as dead" Good joke mate. If Bitcoin fails, Bitcoin2 will be there.
@_date: 2019-04-11 01:19:18
Why you think Bitcoin is not money?

Try to live your soul instead of your ego next decennia. You will have more wealth as well. Reread and think again.

I wasn't talking about religion. The way you feel you should attack others says quite a lot actually. Good spirit, a happy life and I hope you can work things out buddy.

You are the cancer that roams our world. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 14:54:19
44 years old and you care about a bigger boat. You as well will find peace someday if you can cure the spiritual tumor in your head. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 15:24:00
Dude, Im also in with high stakes. Why do you feel the need to attack me or others? It just proves you are NOT free, you are the slave of your ego. You can love and still be wealthy, you know that? If you would hate me, I would just give you more love you see?
Don't get me wrong, I had once the same mindset like you. Belitteling others that are not living up to your standards, etc. And I even named it "free". Now I have a big family with lots of UNCONDITIONAL love, and ofcourse more than enough money and knowledge to support me AND the people I love.
But go ahead and live your ego-life. Most people do it and thats why everything is going to shit and is replaced with technology.
Apart from that, cryptocurrency is a very big new paradigm and we all love it, for FIAT gains, the tech and/or libertarian political views. 
May you find peace.

Have a LOVING, HAPPY and HEALTHY life. Love is a free currency to give. But a lot harder to do than to hate of course. 44 years and still like this.. I do understand its harder for you to 'get' it because 'Murican. 
@_date: 2018-12-23 00:49:04
Why wouldn't you use a crypto though? 
@_date: 2018-12-11 00:20:17
Why is he a dumbass then, moonboy?
@_date: 2018-12-04 23:00:29
Way too 'agressive' for the common people
