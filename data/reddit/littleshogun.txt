TL;DR some people are here for the politics, some are here for the money. I'm just here because I find this fascinating.

Was unaware of this sub. Thank you!

Do you see that as a problem? 
I know from what I've seen on here the community (like any) is diverse in what it does with its Bitcoins. Some want to push forward in pioneering a new means of capital, independent from governments (my phrasing might have been a tad grandiose there) and some want to invest and sell it like a commodity. As someone on the outside looking in, the last thing I want to do is get stiffed on my investment, even when I'm only looking to dangle my feet in the water.

How frustrating. Although, if Bitcoin were considered a currency in the UK it'd be subject to capital gains tax (I think).

I didn't mean those sorta tips, but thank you very much!

Thanks. I just want to make sure I get my facts straight on the best way to go about this. If I provide inaccurate information to my readers then ultimately my credibility (every journalist's bread and butter) is undermined.

If MtGox is not a good indicator of Bitcoin prices, what is? Is there a better site that I can look at that will give me an approximation of, say, what one Bitcoin is worth? From an outsider's POV, how can I know I'm getting a good price?
As for the inflation/deflation thing, I wasn't talking in currency terms but in comparing what I thought was the standard value on the market (MtGox's price) to another exchange/trader (Bittylicious), but I appreciate the explanation.

Nope!
