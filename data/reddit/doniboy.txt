How much did you buy it for?

So your advice is to hold?  No matter what?  Just keep losing money?  That makes you feel good?  Advising people to hold because you can't admit that you are ignorant?

Funny how every rando on the Internet claims to be a millionaire..... 
Why would you brag about being down $2 Million???  I guess you should have sold.

Well South Korea is possibly banning bitcoin, Facebook banned Crypto ads, and US regulators subpoenaed Bitfinex and Tether...But yeah...aside from that "nothing really changed"....

Don't listen to garbage advice like that.  The whole HODL crap is the worst investment advice ever.  It just means that you could be the bag holder for every other person who gets out.  
You lost almost 50% of your investment and you are still holding hoping to God you recover it???  You are not giving up anything if you sell now.  You already lost the $20K.  
You could sell now...wait until there is a bottom and then buy again.  You could sell now, and buy something else that may double your money in a few years.  
You could sell now and be happy that you didn't lose 100% of your investment.  Or, if you truly believe that it will rebound quickly, you could hold and just ignore the dip.  Check the price once a week instead of al the time.
Either way you have to determine the risk you can take.  Can you risk losing your last 22K in the hopes of getting back to 44K?  Only you can answer that.  
Don't HODL, do some real research and make up your mind.
