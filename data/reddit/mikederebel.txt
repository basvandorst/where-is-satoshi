You don't really make sense here now, "it's build on top'.. that is kinda weird excuse as many hard forks are based upon the original bitcoin.. what's the difference there then? That's not builded on top of but build from.. :-) new is new.. built on top or not doesn't make that much difference for me.. It's not Bitcoin, period!

lol, you can even cash out money from the creditcard for free and with a debit card it's also possible. not sure where you are in Europe but in Flanders it ain't like that.

something looks wrong, can't put my finger on it but can someone update? This is Reddit after all.

You are right!

Asking for a name for somebody who wants to be private doesn't really help?

let them create an email, don't lower yourself to their level
Especially when it comes to money people will use whatever method you say if that is the only way you are going to pay them.

Hey OP.
Can you post a picture of your broken hand?
There are multiple ways to show you are real, let's find them and if you need it, you'll get more help then you can imagine.
@_date: 2019-07-02 17:31:50
It's funny that you say this, yet OP has stated that his case had been documented.
I'm not saying all cases are but just that he said his case is documented!

Of course I'd try but Fiat is losing value daily.

people still using Firefox and Chrome?
switched to brave.com here and I'm happy about it :-)

Would you care to update your post?
The other comment has been deleted.

I voted for it, just so it is easier and less confusing for new people.
It's a tricky game!
@_date: 2019-07-02 17:22:04
Hey, what do you say about this :
I'm just trying to find out if there are other ways of 'proving' OP is telling the truth.
Please share your thoughts.
@_date: 2017-12-02 18:31:13
what kind of plugins are we talking about?
you can request new plugins/extensions if you'd like. 
@_date: 2019-07-02 09:38:20
Agreed, some basic proof would go a long way.
@_date: 2018-06-11 11:17:40
oh that's nice you still get interest on the bank! In most countries these days you already have to pay to even have 'your' money on the bank. :-) 
Should consider yourself lucky with your 0,05% interest!

How much more simple can it get?

I only see price increases here on most common products.
In 10 years time the food in the Netherlands went up by 14,50%.

if you believe it's a stranger, what about bots??
@_date: 2019-06-12 17:59:47
Awesome, please add some more (see within comments)
@_date: 2019-06-12 17:57:27
somebody add this please, this is golden!
@_date: 2018-11-24 18:18:43
a lot more people can enter the market at this price? 
It's meant as a payment not as a 'get rich quick' scheme...
The product itself had a great year, I've seen transaction cost go down massively and if I'm correct there is also a higher transaction speed now.

I said: "it seems everybody wants a piece of the pie."
We all know, really know that your cat's shit is worthless ;-)
It's a new currency and it's really not going anywhere soon with so many people supporting it's idea.
@_date: 2018-11-30 14:49:46
I said the same thing for years to my brother :-)
He was right all along, this is the new money of the internet and it seems everybody wants a piece of the pie.
Shame most people want € or $ instead of wanting BTC, there is still only a limited supply and it's being used atm for the wrong reasons (alt coins) but I see more and more real life usage. 
People can't believe when I tell them what we can all buy these days with BTC!

How can you place a debit card in line with a credit card?!
I think it's almost universal that the fee's for debit is a lot less then credit.
@_date: 2019-09-16 18:52:58
Where and how?
It was under $10K in the beginning of the year..
@_date: 2019-09-16 19:54:30
Dude, I'm not responding to OP's comment, I'm responding to yours:


  
It didn't, it went under $10K in 2019.

You can start taking their assets ;-) it's not the money itself that is worth so much but the underlying assets.. it's what you buy with money that they want.
@_date: 2018-07-22 21:58:04


As I've said above, you forget to mention that after WW1 they took all the gold.. and my guess is that was not all they took ;-)
How can you lend more money then you have? I still can't believe we accept this.. Like said below.. keep on printing money but yeah you probably are right they want the 'worthless' money to be paid back instead of some real hard assets like gold, land, power, building, resources.. no, all they want is money which they can print as much as they want.. there is no limit on the money supply..  
@_date: 2019-09-16 18:50:20
I was also thinking the same, last year I made the mistake by thinking it would only take 1 year this time instead of 2 but the charts back then told me it would take another year.
@_date: 2019-09-16 18:52:18
huh? it was way lower for a long time..   
Not True at all, check the charts.
@_date: 2018-12-28 21:44:54
can't you just ask for a cash transfer to your bank account and then buy them wherever you want?
@_date: 2018-12-09 17:11:54
I second this.
@_date: 2018-12-09 13:20:54
cheap to dig up maybe but not so cheap to buy as a normal person :-)
