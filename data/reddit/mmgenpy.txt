That's exactly it. Bitcoin was created to remove trust, but with HW wallets people are just trading one trusted third party (custodial services) for another (the wallet manufacturer). With a custodial service, at least you know who to blame if your coins disappear. With a HW wallet you have no recourse whatsoever and don't even know whom to suspect. Maybe the device was tampered with by the NSA or has a backdoor. Or maybe it was a rogue employee. The possibilities are endless.

Dear Electrum users: Consider [MMGen]( as an alternative. Inspired in part by Electrum, MMGen is a command-line front end for Bitcoin Core that makes key management, address tracking and offline TX signing easy. With MMGen, your secret data **never touches a network-connected computer.**

It supports key/address generation for ETH, ETC and a bunch of other altcoins (this functionality was just added). And the key generation path is different for each coin, so keys don't get reused.

There are no perfect solutions. Tested and peer-reviewed open-source software is still the best one we have.
@_date: 2018-01-06 13:21:28
No. Random number generation is used only when creating private keys (seeds), salting passwords and encrypting (for the init vector). Signing is possible on a machine without a RNG.
@_date: 2018-01-06 13:38:31
It's a question of trust. Ultimately, you're trusting the manufacturer. And the seller. And everyone involved in between: postal service, delivery service, etc. Which means you're trusting third parties. Why should we assume these third parties are more trustworthy than a bank or online wallet service?
@_date: 2018-01-07 15:42:48

The EFF is a good choice, but **please, please, please don't donate to charities!** Charities are nothing but scams created to enrich their already-rich owners and elite donors via tax writeoffs and to whitewash their reputations vis-a-vis the gullible masses.
By donating to so-called “charities” you're only **redistributing wealth to the rich** and furthering corruption on our planet, which is completely against Bitcoin's core principles.
Consider donating instead to projects, developers, organizations, publications and leading individuals in the Bitcoin, peer-to-peer and cryptography space. Many of these people have been working hard for years on pure enthusiasm. They've made Bitcoin what it is today. These are the people who are making a **real difference in the world,** and by helping them **you'd be making a real difference too.**

No, inbound/outbound refers only to how the connection was **established,** i.e. who initiated it.  Once a TCP connection is established, it doesn't matter any more who initiated it. Both ends of the connection are equal and can send and receive data to each other. iptables controls what hosts can establish a connection (with rules on the INPUT chain) and then keeps track of an established connection (with the state module) so that packets can flow in both directions.

Hopefully they're using a more intelligent key-splitting scheme than the one described in this article, where each piece reveals a lot of information about the secret.
N-of-N key splitting is easy: just XOR N-1 random numbers with your key and you have N shares that reveal **nothing** about the key unless you have **all** of them. For backup redundancy, just store duplicates in different vaults.
K-of-N can be done with Shamir's secret sharing scheme, as other commenters have noted in this post.
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:08:58
You might find it easier just to memorize your master seed and store it only in your head. The risk of forgetting it is no greater than the risk of forgetting a password. And there's no physical backup to get lost, stolen or hacked.
I use the MMGen wallet and do all my address generation and signing offline using a memorized seed.

@_date: 2018-08-27 20:45:51
This is known as the "zero address", the address for which the public key is the number zero, and therefore has no known valid private key.
@_date: 2018-08-27 08:20:57
No, you need to run Tor as a separate program. Not sure how you do that on on Windows, as my experience is with Linux. The necessary information on that can probably be found at torproject.org.
@_date: 2018-08-25 08:54:47
The address is the **hash** of the public key. This makes it more secure than the public key in the event that ECDSA is ever broken.

Thanks for the heads up on GBMiners. As to electricity rates, I never said they don't matter, I just stated that they're not the main cause of mining centralization. Many other countries and regions of the world besides China have low electricity rates. In addition, excess capacity from wind/hydro/solar etc. could be put to use mining Bitcoin even in countries with non-competitive rates.

Misleading title, if I've understood the article correctly. The sender sends crypto to an address controlled by the service (which one must assume is closely tied to the government). The service converts crypto to bolivars in a bank account registered with the recipient. The service keeps the crypto plus a 15% fee. The recipient gets bolivars instead of crypto.

@_date: 2018-10-07 09:05:32
If the device is air-gapped, it's limited in the damage it can do. Keyloggers are ineffective if they have no way of getting the data out. And to repeat, an attacker has no way of knowing in advance what the device will be used for and what software it will be running to launch a more specific attack. That's the main point. See Peter's talk and other comments to this post.

This isn't as easy as it might seem at first glance. Even if you order directly from the mfr., packages can be and are intercepted. Then there's the issue of the producer itself, or perhaps a rogue employee or management, being untrustworthy. Not that I think this is the case currently with Trezor or Ledger, but personnel and management can change, or be intimidated or pressured. Open-source software solutions, especially anonymously developed ones, are more resistant to these "meat-space" attack vectors.

You might consider an online/offline software wallet with an air-gapped Raspberry Pi as a signing machine. This is the solution I use. General-purpose hardware is much more difficult for an attacker to target, as Peter points out in his talk: "Software makes it difficult for hardware people to compromise what you're doing, if they don't know in advance what software you're going to run."

That's true, it does hide only amounts. I suppose ring signatures could be used to obfuscate the senders though.
At the recent Baltic Honeybadger one of the devs mentioned a proposed protocol change that would do what you mentioned. I've forgotten the details though, or what it was called.
As far as making mining empty blocks illegal goes, miners could easily get around that restriction by mining a block with just one transaction, which doesn't really fix the problem.

No. The most glaring defect of hardware wallets is the presence of the physical device itself, which identifies you as an owner of bitcoins. It's like painting a bullseye on your back. How can you answer “What bitcoins, sir?” to the customs officer, when he's looking right at your Trezor or Ledger device? Or to your nosy neighbor? Or to the random house guest?
Use an online/offline software wallet with freely-available, open source code. Never put your keys on a network-connected machine. Sign all your transactions offline. Memorize your seed mnemonic. That way, wherever you go, your bitcoins go with you. Invisibly, without leaving any physical trace.
Once you've arrived at your new location, buy a Raspberry Pi and an SD card and download and install the wallet software on it for use as a signing machine. Sign transactions using your mnemonic, so your seed is never stored on any physical medium. Run a full node with a watch-only wallet for broadcasting transactions and tracking your balances.
Difficult? Yes, but true security is always difficult. All the “easy” solutions involve relinquishing control to some trusted third party, and reliance on third parties is exactly what Bitcoin was created to free us from.

Use a Python script on an air-gapped machine to convert the dice rolls into a seed or Bitcoin address.

It's not downloading the raw serialized data that causes most of the disk accesses. It's creating and reading the databases, which if they're not cached in memory must be constantly swapped to disk. On a system with low memory, this swapping activity is quite heavy indeed when the node is syncing.

If you have the disk space, make a copy of the **pre-fork** blockchain. Keep running Core as usual on the original copy. If you wish, you may download and run Bitcoin ABC or another BCH-compatible client on the copy of the blockchain you've made. It doesn't matter when you do that, pre-fork or post-fork. When running two clients, the most important thing is to keep your data directories separate as outlined in the linked commit message.

@_date: 2016-11-26 01:34:12
Well, it depends on your needs. All hardware wallets do share a single disadvantage, though: you're dependent on a physical device you have to carry with you and which gives you away as an owner of Bitcoins. You also typically have to contact the company's website or a centralized server for various operations.
MMGen can be downloaded and installed on any PC, anywhere in the world. And all you have to take with you is your seed, which can be held in your head if you have a good memory. And there's no centralized server - not counting the Github repository you initially download the software from.

This is what [MMGen]( is striving to become. Supporting only BTC and BCH daemons and key generation at the moment, but altcoin support is on the way.

And written in Python of course!

Thanks for the info. That's less than I expected.  I'll definitely give it a try then.
Regarding full sync time, I don't know actually.  Once I got the sync process successfully started, I stopped the node and just transferred the blockchain to it from another computer to save time, so I ended up doing an IBD on only the last 4,000 blocks or so.
Given my recent experience doing a full sync on my laptop, though (it has a comparable CPU and a slower disk), I'd say probably less than a day.  With 8 gigs of RAM you can easily set aside 6 gigs for -dbcache, which speeds things up greatly.
Regarding CPU speed: this box's 4 cores max out at about 35 blocks/min when validating 1MB blocks, while the disk is barely breaking a sweat, so CPU is definitely the bottleneck here.

A full node gives you freedom and security. You get to make transactions directly on the blockchain without any third parties involved, which was the original idea behind Bitcoin.
As far as upkeep goes, well, this little box's energy requirements are extremely low, probably somewhere around 4 to 5W.
The disk has a limited lifetime and might need replacement someday, but then I have notebooks that have gotten constant usage for years, and their disks are still going strong. And with a Bitcoin node, disk usage actually isn't that heavy once you're in sync.

A seed is just a 32-byte number. The best way to split it is by trivially XOR'ing it with a random number. This can be done *n* number of times to create *n*+1 splits, none of which reveals anything about the seed until you have all *n* together. Each split can be stored in the form of a mnemonic phrase if desired.

**The attack**
The attacker creates a counterfeit OpenDime mimicking a real one that's already generated a key and has a balance. He sells it to the victim. When the victim breaks the seal to recover the private key, the device destroys the key instead of revealing it. Profit.
**The solution**
To prevent such an attack, the device should contain a second secret, the *validating secret,* generated at the time of its manufacture and held by the manufacturer. The recipient of an already-loaded device connects to the company's site and validates it with this secret via a challenge/response mechanism. The validating secret is destroyed when the seal is broken.

To get the original seed, just XOR the random numbers with the result of the calculation. This can all be done easily at the Python prompt.  It's something I've wanted to implement in the [MMGen wallet]( for a long time, but just haven't gotten around to it. Since I see this problem coming up often, maybe I'll make it a priority.
Converting the seed phrase to a seed and back again is a separate, wallet-dependent operation. My wallet uses simple [base conversion]( for example, while BIP39 wallets use a bit field plus a checksum.
In the following example, we perform a 3-way split and then recover the seed from the 3 splits:
	 python3
	seed  = 0xdeadbeef
	rand1 = 0xf00f00ff
	rand2 = 0xbaabaaba
	rand3 = seed ^ rand1 ^ rand2

The number's not arbitrary: it's the mathematical result of Bitcoin's emission schedule, i.e. the halving every 210,000 blocks (≈4 years). You correctly noted the religious aspect of it, however, and this is no accident but a stroke of genius on Satoshi's part. By halving the block reward relatively infrequently, instead of reducing it more gradually (as some other coins do), Satoshi created a quasi-religious event via which the community once every four years reaffirms the inviolability of Bitcoin's emission schedule and hence the 21 million limit. This creates a powerful defense against those who might seek at some point in the future to corrupt Bitcoin by inflating the coin supply.

Splitting to your own wallet is never a problem. The problem arises after you've spent to a third party on one chain and a massive reorg occurs on the other chain, allowing that tx, plus the split tx that preceded it, to be replayed.
Whether that risk is real or not depends a lot on how things play out after the fork.

With a base blocksize increase up to just 4MB, that requirement increases to 20GB. Most consumer PCs today don't even support 20GB of RAM.
And I'm not even mentioning other factors like Internet bandwidth, which makes running a full node prohibitive for many even with the current 1MB blocksize.

While Andreas’ statement that “all cryptographic systems have an end life” is correct, his conclusion that this must lead inevitably to broken keys in the event of their owners’ inactivity is flat out wrong.
If Bitcoin’s EC signature scheme ever becomes threatened by quantum computing, an additional encumbrance, perhaps in the form of a quantum-proof signature scheme, could be added through a soft fork to protect **all** UTXOs in the blockchain (with the exception of the early P2PK “Satoshi coins”).

@_date: 2019-01-09 19:37:51
There are simpler ways to do it. For example, the protocol upgrade could require an “enabling transaction” containing an embedded txid + hash of the private key (after an OP_RETURN for example) and signed using the quantum-proof scheme to already be in the blockchain before an output could be spent. Any tx not matching that txid that attempts to spend the output would be rejected by the consensus rules. The private key hash proves ownership of the keypair w/o revealing the pubkey. Simple, and no ZKP required.

Took a look at the paper. The authors propose a commit-reveal scheme similar to the one I mentioned, only implementable as a soft fork.

Hardware wallets have too many attack vectors. There's only one real way to be secure: **Run a full node.** Sign all transactions offline and never let your seed or keys come in contact with a network-connected device.
The [MMGen wallet]( was created to make this process easier.
@_date: 2019-01-19 10:26:04
The most secure storage method: use a software wallet like Electrum or [MMGen]( on an **offline, air-gapped machine** to generate your keys and addresses. Write down your seed phrase **by hand** on a piece of paper. As an additional security measure, **memorize** your seed phrase.
@_date: 2018-03-14 06:11:33
In that case, you do need a physical backup, or you could split your seed (or use multisig) among the beneficiaries, with each choosing their backup method independently. But memorizing your seed phrase will provide additional security no matter what backup strategy you choose.

Satoshi's original keys can't be hacked by a quantum computer, even if ECDSA is broken, because the public keys are unknown. Recall that a Bitcoin address is the **hash** of the public key, not the public key itself.
And if ECDSA is ever broken, all that will be required is a protocol fork to require some quantum-proof signature scheme in order to spend outputs. However, this will only protect outputs with addresses that haven't been spent, which is why not reusing addresses is so important.

@_date: 2017-10-02 12:23:07
Answer: **on the blockchain.**
The wallet type is secondary: it could be hardware, [software]( or paper.
@_date: 2017-10-22 17:35:45
The more full nodes there are relaying transactions and validating the blockchain, the healthier the system is. It doesn't matter whether they're mining nodes or not. Bitcoin was designed as, and remains, a system in which anyone can be a full participant.
@_date: 2017-10-02 08:37:46
All of my recent transactions have had fees of around 10 sat/byte ($0.10), and they've all confirmed within a few hours.
@_date: 2017-10-02 13:08:57
I think it's safe to assume that the miners currently putting 'NYA' in their coinbases plan to be running btc1 by flag day. Whether or not they carry through depends in part on us making our opposition clear. Unless they can be persuaded to change their minds, the HF **will** happen, and it **will** be a mess.
@_date: 2018-02-14 09:00:00
You're referring to changenow.io? Thanks for the info. Will give it a try.
@_date: 2017-10-02 14:08:13
Bitfury and BTCC are currently signalling NYA in their coinbases. I'm not sure we can count on them.
@_date: 2017-10-10 08:55:46
Thefts like this one are going to become more and more common as Bitcoin grows in value, and there's only one sure-fire way to prevent them: **never** store private keys on a network-connected computer. **Sign all transactions offline** with a hardware wallet, or an online/offline software wallet such as [MMGen](
@_date: 2017-10-10 16:04:46
The time lock prevents the first tx from being replayed on the short chain. And the second tx can't be replayed on the long chain because its inputs have already been spent.

Full node + wallet:
Still the best solution: a dedicated full node on a mini-PC:
@_date: 2017-10-01 11:30:35
Even better: Run a full node and use the [MMGen wallet](
MMGen supports both BTC and BCH, and will include support for the upcoming 2x fork if it has replay protection.
@_date: 2017-10-30 19:06:34
Thanks! When you get around to setting up that full node, PM me and I can give you some pointers.
@_date: 2017-10-28 17:54:00
Not so. There are soft-fork PoW-additions schemes, like [this one](
@_date: 2017-10-30 18:08:21
I'm MMGen's one and only developer. It's a one-man project. So yes, I do have a stake in its success!
The code's out there on [Github]( for anyone to review, download and use.
@_date: 2017-10-28 17:04:33
There are ASIC-resistant PoW algorithms, like Equihash and Cuckoo Cycle, for instance. Equihash is already being used by a number of coins, including Zcash.
@_date: 2018-07-28 15:34:49
Nice article!
You might mention that desktop clients like Bitcoin Core allow you to sign transactions on a separate offline machine so that your funds remain safe even in the event your online machine is hacked.
The [wallet I develop]( is a front-end that makes this process a bit easier for non-command-line challenged users. Currently supported backends are Bitcoin Core, Bitcoin ABC (for BCH), Litecoin Core and Parity (for ETH and ERC20 tokens).
@_date: 2017-10-10 15:17:59
In a nutshell: create and send a tx on the longest chain with a time lock at the current block height. After it confirms, create another tx double-spending the same inputs to a different address and broadcast it on the short chain. When this tx confirms, your funds are split. No existing wallets (as far as I'm aware) provide users with a way to create such time locked txs, but it would be rather trivial to implement, which is why I plan to do it.
@_date: 2017-10-30 12:06:08
The [MMGen wallet]( is a coin daemon frontend that does what you've just described, only much more conveniently. Plus it offers many additional features, including complete control over your inputs, offline transaction autosigning, password generation and altcoin support.
@_date: 2019-09-21 08:04:39
Yes, should have explained that after the quantum apocalypse Satoshi's bitcoins are guaranteed stolen in any case (assuming they're not moved before then), because they're P2PK, not P2PKH.
@_date: 2017-10-10 14:45:30
Good that Garzik removed this hideous code.
You can always use time locked transactions to split your funds.  This is perfectly safe as long as you spend only to addresses you control. I hope to have this feature introduced in the [MMGen wallet]( before the fork takes place.
@_date: 2017-10-22 17:19:44
Running a full node means downloading the Bitcoin Core software and running it on your computer. Anyone can do it. You can also use your node to transact with and as a wallet to store your bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-10-24 09:11:45
On a separate, air-gapped device. Which will never be connected to any network in the future. This can be a cheap, low-powered device.  For example, I use a $20 Orange Pi to generate seeds and addresses and sign transactions:
@_date: 2017-10-02 08:49:03
It's laughable that businesses aren't using raw transactions, as that's the only way to give yourself control over transaction inputs. They could use the [MMGen wallet]( or implement an analogous solution.
@_date: 2017-10-01 13:23:26
Well, I think we can assume the fork coin will have at least **some** value.  I for one will be happy to trade my 2x coins for BTC after the fork, just as I traded my BCH for BTC.
@_date: 2018-02-19 12:42:46
Leak the info anonymously so they can't prove you leaked it.
@_date: 2017-10-03 13:52:55
Using the -assumevalid switch with a recent block hash will greatly speed up your initial block download.
With -assumevalid, your IBD shouldn't take more than 15 hrs on a reasonably fast system.
@_date: 2018-07-28 19:08:01
The signature proves that the owner of the output has authorized it to be spent, but without revealing the owner's private key. The private key is required to sign the transaction, but signing can be done offline, so the private key is needed only on the offline computer. The signed transaction is then passed to an online computer for broadcasting to the network.
@_date: 2017-10-23 11:44:07
If you generate your keys and sign transactions offline, it's the **most secure** wallet solution, period, more secure than hardware wallets.
Have a look at the software I develop:
@_date: 2017-10-10 16:41:52
Exactly. But if that fails and the first tx is replayed on the short chain, no funds are lost because you control the output address. Just try again until the split succeeds.
@_date: 2017-05-18 17:51:34


This is exactly [what I've been proposing]( for some time now.
@_date: 2017-05-03 20:59:45
[My proof-of-work additions proposal.]( Partial or gradual phase-in, deprives existing SHA2 miners of ability to do harm while allowing them to continue mining. Adding a new memory-hard PoW breaks dependence on specialized hardware, aids decentralization.
@_date: 2015-03-11 19:45:37
Upping the maximum block size would also help.
@_date: 2017-05-31 13:51:13
I sent a transaction with 4 inputs recently and it cost me only $2.50 in fees. But then again, I'm using a wallet that [supports RBF.](
@_date: 2017-05-17 10:38:02
Wallets should take that possibility into account and have a maximum fee.
@_date: 2017-05-12 12:06:40
Don't use a hardware wallet. Use an [online-offline software wallet]( and memorize your seed mnemonic. Then the only thing you'll be taking through customs is your brain.
@_date: 2017-05-15 06:11:53
It doesn't have to be all or nothing. There are PoWA (proof-of-work additions) schemes, [like the one I've proposed]( that can introduce a new PoW partially or gradually.
@_date: 2017-05-04 08:16:23
Just making sure the message gets out to everyone.
@_date: 2017-05-17 13:05:43
[MMGen]( has a hard-coded maximum fee (overrideable via the config file). Its new RBF functionality also makes it easy to create a series of replacement transactions with incrementally higher fees and broadcast them in succession until you get a confirmation. A very handy feature given our current fee situation.
@_date: 2015-03-11 19:53:17
My proposal is for a maximum tx fee in percentage terms.  And yes it would require forking the protocol and getting the miners onboard with that first.  But motivating them shouldn't be hard: if Bitcoin crashes so do do they ... unless they're already colluding with Blythe ;-)
@_date: 2017-05-29 09:20:23
If you're at all comfortable working at the command line, you might consider running a full node and downloading [MMGen,]( a secure, private online/offline software wallet that's basically a front-end for Bitcoin Core. Then back up your seed and, most importantly, memorize your mnemonic. Your brain is the best backup location there is.
@_date: 2017-05-14 19:38:04


Agreed.  But there's an even more radical and effective solution than UASF: PoW change.
@_date: 2017-05-17 10:38:47
Not wallets with a hard maximum fee.
@_date: 2017-05-30 21:24:52
Consider running a node on a [mini-PC]( instead. It's **much** more powerful than the Pi and can sync the entire blockchain in around 40 hrs., yet it uses only 8 watts, not much more than your Pi + external hard drive.
@_date: 2017-05-12 07:50:17
Then use a wallet like [MMGen] ( with user-enhanced entropy.
@_date: 2017-05-18 05:49:32


If so, that's a good thing. But I think you meant "when asking confirmation from the user before sending". A "confirming transaction" is one that's been sent and is awaiting inclusion in the blockchain, so by then it would be too late to do anything about the fee.
@_date: 2017-05-19 20:51:17
You need to follow the discussion more closely. There are ways to change the PoW partially or gradually, without invalidating existing infrastructure.
@_date: 2015-03-11 19:05:35
I agree with you absolutely.  The only solution, as I see it, is to introduce a hard-coded maximum transaction fee, as a percentage of input value.  See my comment above.
@_date: 2017-05-17 15:30:09
I've thought about Bitcoin use in Japanese retail leading to a fee crisis too. And guess who'll be there to make the most of it? Roger Ver, with bitcoin.com headquartered right in Tokyo and a carefully cultivated reputation among the Japanese as Bitcoin guru number one.

The Github UASF binaries are signed by Luke-Jr and Wladimir, so they're unlikely to be infected with malware.
@_date: 2015-03-11 20:09:34
Such a scenario is possible in theory, but it would require all the major miners plus Blythe/banksters to be conspiring together, which isn't likely.  And the miners would be agreeing to destroy Bitcoin as we know it, which isn't in their interests unless Blythe and the banksters offer them fantastic sums in return.
@_date: 2017-07-31 18:31:14
Yes. Just keep your private keys on an offline machine, or in your head in the form of a mnemonic. Your bitcoin is safe as long as the key's safe.
@_date: 2017-05-18 17:54:49
I've proposed a [gradual, non-disruptive, soft-forking way]( of changing the PoW.
@_date: 2015-03-11 19:34:12
The fees don't have to be that high.  They have to be just higher than everyone else's fees, with enough transactions to max out each block so others' transactions won't be included.
The attack doesn't have to last for long.  With their resources, they could lock everyone out for say 24, 48 or 72 hours... enough to bring about a panic, crash the price and allow them to buy up even more BTC, bankrupt the miners, etc., etc.
@_date: 2017-07-31 21:35:00
You should have two copies of the blockchain that were synced **before** the fork. You then have the choice to run your Core client on one chain and the ABC client (should you decide to do that) on the other. Take a look at the linked post. You might find some pointers there.
@_date: 2017-07-31 20:22:20
If you have any doubts about which fork you want to take, then you should back up your blockchain before the fork. There's nothing to stop you from running wallets on both chains.
@_date: 2017-07-28 13:45:22
Not only BitPay, but **all** of the big wallet providers have missed the obvious opportunity to implement in-house payment channels and take on VISA or MasterCard directly. Which shows that they're either afraid...or compromised.
@_date: 2017-07-24 10:20:11
If there's no config file (bitcoin.conf), you can create one in a text editor
and put the following line in it:
        onlynet=onion
The file goes in your data directory (where blocks and chainstate are). The file must be a plain text file of course.

No. When you receive bitcoin, your private key isn't exposed in any way. And if you send bitcoin by signing the send transaction offline, your key isn't exposed when sending either. There's need to **ever** expose a key on an online machine, even briefly.

Check this out: 
Skip the parts about installing Tor from torproject - the stock Tor (at least the one on Ubuntu xenial) works just fine. Also, when you run the node for the first time, you'll need to seed it with a known node on the network using -addnode. Otherwise you'll just sit there with no connections.
@_date: 2019-05-29 10:40:39


I wholeheartedly agree with this. And the best example is Bitcoin's own pseudonymous creator.
@_date: 2015-03-11 18:55:32
Why only a .1 BTC fee?  Why not 1, 10 BTC ... or more?  The sky's the limit for the banksters Blythe is working for, who are worth trillions and could easily buy enough BTC on the open market (or at auction) to pay for such enormous fees on every transaction, thus monopolizing every block and locking out ordinary users from the system.  No prior agreement with the miners would even be necessary at first.
Once faith in Bitcoin is destroyed, the price crashes and acquiring the necessary BTC (and optionally buying up bankrupt mining operations just to be on the safe side, hehe) becomes even easier.
The only solution I see is to make a maximum transaction fee (say 1 percent of the input value) part of the protocol, hard-code it into Bitcoin Core and get the miners and community on board with a massive PR campaign.  This must be done ASAP, otherwise Bitcoin might perish.  This is a serious attack indeed.
 EDIT:
A bit of research on tx fees reveals that Satoshi seems to have foreseen this attack.  50 kb in each block is reserved for the highest-priority transactions regardless of fee (priority is age times amount divided by tx size in bytes), so _totally_ monopolizing the block with high fee transactions is impossible.
The attack could slow the network down to a crawl though, especially as transaction rates increase with time.  The solution here would be to increase this reserved area in the block.  This could be done when the maximum block size of 1MB is increased, as it inevitably will be some day in the future.
