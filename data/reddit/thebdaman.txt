How on earth have you managed to avoid the thousands of times people have warned about this? If you're going to own crypto you at least have to check in on the space at least a few times a week.

What I find most interesting about this incident is that u/Kain_niaK is actually a paid representative of bch. I had genuinely no idea this was going on and would have viewed his posts and responses to me very differently had I known.   
I can think of a few others whose attitudes make a lot more sense now.

Makes me pretty sad to see support for UK racists on there.

Probably garner me more downvotes but;

He wasn't imprisoned under free speech law. Plus hate speech is a crime in the UK. Nice strawman btw.

I'm demonising one single known racist who likes to use the free speech argument to appear the victim. Much like your carefully structured post attempting to make me appear to be making a generalized statement on a concept which I have not done.

With the dark stock, I actually didn't realise what it was. Subliminal for me!

Well, there's other fiat and there's other crypto. And it's hugely unlikely USD will become worthless quicker than a man who has 9 mil can afford accountants/advisers to warn and guard against. I take your point though.

With 9 mill, why bother? Genuine question.

Just make sure it's in a wallet off any exchanges. Then you'll get to choose which fork you want your BTC to be a part of. At least that's my understanding.   
(just be sure you have the private keys)
