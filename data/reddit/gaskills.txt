Correct, however settlement of value between chainpoint node operator and user (service provider or consumer) will occur using $tnt. Also the chainpoint standard supports both btc and eth currently and most likely ltc in future. Which aligns to the requirements for global scale talked about in the article.

Incorrect, the team have confirmed that nothing changes for TNT, the are simply launching a new product \(proof\). The old Product "Tierion" is being retired, the Tierion Network \(which comprises of chainpoint, and now proof, is what will exist post that date.
Chainpoint is a decentralised layer 2 protocol. It consists of a set of standards aswell as a public blockchain \(The chainpoint calendar\) maintained by the public who run over 7000 nodes validating blocks in the calendar. The chainpoint calendar blockchain is the first point of reference for data that is anchored, hashes get submit to the nodes on the network and the nodes validate and aggregated those hashes into merkle tree's which get anchored to BTC blockchain.

That blog post is literally the announcement they are now going to offer the service Proof, in addition to Chainpoint. This announcement was also coupled with their website relaunch [ which now talks about proof. The team have confirmed there is no change to the tierion network token \(tnt\) and it's role in the Tierion network, which comprises of both chainpoint, and now proof. Tierion is the company, chainpoint, and proof, are the services available to developers / businesses. Also regarding the "dead project" it has more github commits than 90&amp; of crypto projects, averaging 70 commits per month [

 the actual layer 2 protocol they are using is chainpoint daniel confirms this in his tweet, see my comment for more info.
@_date: 2018-05-14 18:40:05
I run a small number of the 7000 nodes validating the chainpoint calendar currently a proof of stake (5000 tnt) is required to be held in an eth address linked to the node. TNT is currently used as an incentive for network participants and as per the whitepaper will also be used as a method for settlement in future. What part of the comment are you saying "no" to.

The title of this reddit post is wrong they are using chainpoint not lightning network to anchor to btc. Daniel Buchner confirms here they are using Chainpoint as the layer 2 decentralised protocol to anchor to the btc blockchain 
Chainpoint is managed by company called Tierion. Tierion has already been proven to be able to anchor hundreds of millions of hashes per day to btc blockchain giving it global scale see here. 
Chainpoint is also being used and proven by enterprise platforms already with over 7000 nodes maintaining the chainpoint calendar as the layer 2 protocol see here: 
Also Tierion are part of DIF and been working with microsoft for long time heres Tierion ceo tweet from MS san fran office in dec last year 
Heres collab announcement from early DIF days
Here is specific technical details on the layer 2 protocol in their original whitepaper which also explains microsofts involvement.  
The token is agnostic and will allow anchoring across all major public chains not just BTC.
EDIT: MORE INFO
Tierion network token (TNT) as stated in the whitepaper will be used as a means for settlement of value between network participants.
This video here shows Tierion CEO Wayne Vaughan and Daniel Buchner at consensus last yeardiscussing hypothetical use cases for linked in. 
EDIT: RECENT ANNOUNCEMENT FROM TIERION
Tierion today launched their new website,  which talks to a new service "proof"  that will be offered to businesses. They have confirmed no change to the Tierion Network Token (TNT) and it's use in the network.

This is FUD, Peter todd runs a competing business [ Microsoft would not be using chainpoint if it were not secure.
Most of the arguments in that post are made redundant by the NIST integration which although Peter "doubts" they have done, they have.

The first 2 sentences in this tweet make it terrible to read / understand.
It is riddled with words that make no sense, punctuation in all the wrong places, and a sentence starting with “And”.
Not only debt is growing faster then even, the effect on GDP is declining.
And large parts of the population are excluded from the growth, but are paying for it.

Bitcoin drives competitiveness to produce efficient computational components and efficient energy production. Renewable sharable open market energy is the most efficient energy. Our own greed and hunger for bitcoin over time will drive a reduction in co2 emissions. The amount we spend on fossil fuels to mine gold and or support banking and payments infrastructure will reduce over time as this grows.

So the idea is that the giver sends this card and also tells the receiver the seed words? Isn’t that a problem that the giver also has the seed words? And if not that then how does the receiver get the seed words to write on the back (assuming they are a newbie being introduced to bitcoin)?

That is another service that does similar things to this yes. One of the differences in user experience is that we also store the fingerprint and proof on our servers so anyone with the file can identify the earliest time it has been witnessed by presenting the original file. Knowing whether you are looking at the earliest proof / existence of a file where that is not known might be an interesting feature (especially if/when we build it out to support decentralised storage of proofs)
@_date: 2019-10-30 19:52:18
Hi, thanks for your feedback / questions.
Regarding 1. The system already batches using chainpoint there is literally 1 bitcoin transaction every 30 minutes which could include thousands (or millions) of file fingerprints. It does this through chainpoint which is a second layer protocol of ~6500 community run nodes all recieving and aggregating hashes into a merkle tree (the root of which is included in a single bitcoin txn)
Regarding 2. I have pondered whether this problem can be solved by bitcoin. The current app certainly doesnt and i think it would need to extend to decentralised and encrypted storage of files before we could consider it. It is one of the harder problems to solve. At this stage we just prove existence.
@_date: 2019-06-25 22:28:49
This is useful when you consider that bitcoin is not just an immutable ledger of transactions, but an immutable record of timestamped data.

Must be a better way where the private key remains private and only known by the receiver.

Yes, all proofs can be independently verified as to validity of the hash and which block on the bitcoin blockchain they were anchored to / timestamped against.
[Here]( is an example of an open source web client that can be used to verify proofs. It is also a way to create proofs outside of microsoft flow.

because if twitter, reddit or other social media company deletes your post, or if they changed their policy, or if they no longer exist in the future, you have no evidence. Or if a staff member with access to the twitter DB modifies the tweet timestamps or changes the entries your evidence has been tampered with. It removes the need to trust in any third parties security or existence, instead you can trust in bitcoins security and existence.

Agree keys to define ownership of a house is ridiculous, the only way to truely break free is with decentralised identity using new wc3 did auth standards.
Instead of keys representing ownership, keys authenticate access to your personal data stores with multiple recovery methods.
Your data stores hold attestations about your DID (decentralised identifiers). An attestation can be from any other DID eg. a government DID attests that you own that house, or you’re born on x date, a company DID attests you have a job there, a bank attests you have x balance. You can choose what attestations you share with who. Others can verify who signed those claims / attestations using public keys as attestations will be anchored / time stamped to the most secure public blockchain (Btc) and we all choose what attestations we trust and don’t trust. We now live in a world where we can prove anything about ourselves and our property without the person we are trying to prove it to needing a relationship with the issuer of the claim.

Heres some info on chainpoint progress last year [Chainpoint 2018 in review]( 
Tierion is the company that maintains chainpoint. They are launching a new product  proof.com that I imagine will build on this protocol.
Eventually bitcoin will become the global proof layer used to prove / verify that data existed in a certain form at a certain time and these products / protocols make it easy for mainstream applications to integrate with a 2nd payer protocol that achieves it at scale.
@_date: 2019-01-23 13:37:55
I work in a bank, specifically the payments industry for 10+ years. Banks are being less and less relevant over the last 5 years. We are outsourcing and selling the foundational capabilities in which we were preciously relied upon.
We do 3 things, we take deposits, we lend money, and we process payments. 
Our traditional money flows with respect to the later 2 are being marginalised. 
With respect to payment processing we have to give clips not just to schemes (visa mc) but now intermediary wallet providers (apple google) intermediary processors or payment gateways (stripe, adyen) and now even payment facilitators  (uber air bnb) are getting a clip between the seller / consumer. This is happening to us because we are simple too slow in our ability to deliver technology that provides better customer experiences.
With regards to lending we live in a society where convenience and saving time is a preference over security and cost. More and more people are turning to lower tier lenders who can approve them in a day whilst we put them through days of paperwork. 
Continued regulatory scrutiny will mean we slowly become irrelevant in the sharing economy with new trust layers already being formed. Banks sell trust, blockchain replaces trust with proof amongst peers.

Peter Todd has a competing product that does the same thing. Called open timestamps.
@_date: 2019-01-23 09:53:01
As a global timestamp / trust layer for the internet BTC could enable much more efficient digital experiences. Right now, all our interactions in our digital lives are slowed down by the fact we (people, companies, devices) can not trust who / what is at the other end of a connection. So we implement inefficient centralised authentication systems and everyone has an account with every company / website. Those companies and websites cant share data about us with each other and on-boarding to gain trust often includes paper based documents and in-person processes. This is bigger than sound money, the foundations for the new internet are being built and public blockchains will become the trust layers. Eventually my Government will have a DID (decentralised identifier) that makes an attestation (using their private / public key) about my DID that I am over 21 years of age. They anchor a hash of this attestation to BTC and if I choose to share that attestation with anyone it can be verified to have come from
the governments DID using their pub key. There is no other technology before blockchain that could enable an internet where we no longer need accounts. Digital interacts where we interact as peers. I decide what I share, you decide what you trust, we then both decide how we interact.
@_date: 2019-01-25 04:21:21
Identity systems are the foundations of how we interact online. They are being rebuilt / defined through open standards. DID auth standards already live from w3c. Its being lead by the decentralised identity foundation including companies like microsoft who currently have \~95% market share of enterprise identity systems. This is not about cryptographic authentication, its about decentralised identity and it couldn’t exist without a public immutable layer to record DID state in which verification can occur without a trusted 3rd party.

This is correct. chainpoint.org is an alternative protocol that does 1 transaction per 30 mins and anchors / timestamps hundreds of millions of proofs per hr. Chainpoint is an open source L2 that has 5000+ nodes which act as api end points receiving proofs, aggregating using merkle tree to be anchored to btc.
It is 10x better way to anchor and it has actual customers (including phillips, xer0, jungla and many more) using the api / network to anchor audit-able proofs to btc. Accredible also anchors education qualifications to btc using chainpoint.
