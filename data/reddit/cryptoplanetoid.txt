Does anyone know how much it costs to mine 1 btc roughly? 
Any ideas on the range of the cost? (I know different countries/different electricity costs affect this)
If anyone knows/has an idea, i would really appreciate it!

How long until you’re 18? Good chance by that time, the market will have gone up. I’d start buying some off kijiji/atm’s/etc. 
You won’t get mugged, just meet up at a local mcdonald’s/somewhere public. Call them before to make sure they’re legit, think it through. Very low chance you’ll get mugged haha, i’d say it’s worth the risk considering that now we are still in the early stages of crypto.
Don’t let this life opportunity pass you. $12,000 bitcoin is cheap in the long run, it’s just getting started imo.
But hey i could be wrong. If i we’re you i’d start buying some asap.

Feels like bitcoin will drop more- until reddit gets fully depressed i don't think we are at a bottom

Also, put some into bitcoin. But really you should research more about other coins that are promising.
Platforms, DEX’s, protocols/developer tools. This is where the real money will be made. Bitcoin still isn’t a bad investment.
Check out EOS, Icon, NEO, OmiseGo. Just to name a few strong ones, helping you get started ;). 
Believe me, spend your time researching about other coins, and you will be rewarded multiple folds. Bitcoin is just the tip of the iceberg.

I used to day trade a lot, for a long time. I made a lot but lost a lot. At the end of it all barely made anything. 
I'd recommend day trading if you have prior experience and are good at it.
Otherwise, as a friend, I highly suggest you spend more time researching about the fundamentals of a project. Spend your time researching about projects. Don't waste your precious time on day trading, instead use that time to gain more knowledge and further your understanding of the crypto space.
In the long-run you will be rewarded 10x. You will become more educated. And it is much less stressful.
Day trading imo is a pain, extremely stressful, and you don't learn much. 
This is a friendly suggestion. I used to day trade for 2 years, and deeply regret it as I could have used all that time to research/study about blockchain and projects. 
Also, if you invest long-term, you won't have to worry about taxes (1-year + hold) ;)

Is the mid-term bitcoin bubble starting to pop? We went from $700-$20000. Expecting more correction and sideways/death for the next 6 months or so at least. New money coming in needs to die and feel pain for the cycle to restart itself. Long-term this is just the beginning, but short-mid term looks scary. Anyone agree?
