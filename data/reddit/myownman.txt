Totally plausible.  However:
From what I can tell out of Zane's comments, it looks like a BFX-side penetration and manipulation of the generation of multisigged private keys.
I don't have any more info than anyone else, but I feel like draining 120k BTC should have been noticed rather quickly/instantly by "the leader of blockchain security".  
Not sure how they would mitigate it, but they damn sure should've noticed it and reported it sooner.  5 hours is a looong time.
This reeks of inside-job.
@_date: 2016-08-03 14:26:34
I'm talking about how everyone seems to be focused on BFX, and not really about how bitgo managed to miss/ignore/authorize the movement and conversion of 120,000 BTC within a 3-5 hour period of time.
They claim to be "[the leader in blockchain security]( but...
If they didn't notice that huge outlier, they're incompetent.  
If they ignored it, why?  What are their motivations for looking the other way?
If they willfully allowed it, they might be complicit.

Pay no mind.  There is a sect of bitcoiners that insists that full nodes ~~should~~ MUST be able to run using TOR or low bandwidth connections.
Luke is leading that charge.
Frankly, I think people who feel that full nodes should be able to work in extremely low bandwidth or onion/private configurations are in the wrong camp.  
There are altcoins for that.  Altcoins that can be entered and exited via Bitcoin.
I am of the opinion that Bitcoin is for the masses and should not have static bottlenecks as a "feature".  
More users, more bandwidth, higher blocksize.  It's inevitable, and serious confirmation congestion is looming.  Calling transactions "spam" doesn't change the fact that bigger blocks will come in the (near) future.
If you want tiny blocks with no "spam" (a tx is a tx, regardless) there's an alt for that.  If you want privacy/anonymity there's an alt for that.
This debate has become a pissing contest.  Those high-profile members of the community who are the most vocal opponents to a blocksize increase (of any kind) are fully entrenched and can no longer listen, let alone accept, reasonable counterargument.

Am I really going to have to spend all day picking nits with pedants over a joke?
When I said "hurrdurr... no regulation", I was referring to no regulations instituted for the protection of anyone other than predators.  I'm sorry I was unclear, since I'm on a phone and not a computer.  This post, and those before it were a real bitch to type out with my thumbs.
So what you're saying is that there were *no regulations* to prevent the packaging and resale of obvious garbage?  And *no regulations* preventing a massive undertaking of bad loans?  And *no regulations* regarding the masking of said loans unworthiness?
You said the banks were "forced" to give loans to minorities in slums.  While I'm sure we're both in agreement that's a gross oversimplification of the actual regulations enacted, I will offer my own personal anecdote that is based on experience.
What were the "signature safaris" I saw when i was at Wells?  They would gather the skeeviest loan officers into a room and tell them not to take no for an answer, then send them out to bang on doors in the shittiest neighborhoods in Denver to exchange an equity payout for a balloon mortgage.   
Many of those people were misinformed, taken advantage of due to a combination of educational and financial deficit, or outright lied to.
It was clearly a predatory practice back then, and its an obvious land/cash grab while working with a regulatory net that is ambivalent to the welfare of the citizens those regulations are supposed to protect in hindsight.

It's not that cut and dried.
Bad regulations and a lack of a popular voice in how regulations are applied are most definitely a, if not THE, problem.  It's simple to have a polar opinion about complex issues, but its never correct.
That's the game the regulators hope we continue to play.  They make bad regulations because we have no input, then we complain that regulations are the problem.   They can then point to popular opinion when a good regulation (for you and I) comes along that would limit their ability to greed us into a depression.
Don't get me wrong, every rule has a loophole.  There are people far smarter than us what are paid handsomely to find them and exploit them.  But, please, don't for one second believe that "forcing banks to lend to bad candidates" is the cause of the CDO debacle.

Disclaimer!: I know this sounds a little far-fatched, and that I'm starting with a predetermined conclusion and filling in the details to fit... But it was interesting mental masturbation.
 I have a foilhat theory that involves Karpales backing a mining manufacturer with the reserve coins in order to double up his coins.
Karpales convinces early adopters to hold coins on his exchange while bots trade them at a 1%-2% gain per day.  The only condition is that they can't withdraw for a specified amount of time.
Karpales then takes that reserve and invests in a mining hardware venture.  Since the Chinese and Japanese don't really get along, its probably an American company that shall not be named.
The idea was to fund the mining company and have their first chips 'burn in' for an extended period prior to shipping to their customers.  This was a bet that required a drastic increase in BTC price (Karpales/Gox could reasonably assure that, as they run the exchange) AND the mining company had to deliver on time.
The problem is that the mining company under delivered.  Fewer coins than were required to keep the scheme afloat were mined because China won the mining arms race.
Now Karpales has lost twofold.  His investment is locked in an insolvent mining company (which just sold itself to tiger direct ) and a short stack of mining returns.  So not only is Karpales out his gains, he's out a sizeable portion of his friends' coins.
Now, the only way to recoup the losses is to short sell a large number of coins on his own exchange to crash the market, so he can rebuy them at a lower price on multiple exchanges.
I predict more sell offs.  The price will not rebound as fast as required.

1) No, provided the coins are already in your wallet.  If you have coins that have been sent later, they will not be available in your wallet until you sync.
2) Backup your wallet.dat file to an external location.  Make sure its encrypted.  You can import that wallet.dat file into any other install of qt.
3) Your keys are yours on the blockchain.  Qt is an app to communicate with the block chain.
Have a look at Also, some people will mock you (and me) for this suggestion.. But download the Doge qt and experiment.  It has essentially the same functionality, but very low cost/risk to learn by doing.  I have tipped you a few to start.

I must admit that it's going to be interesting watching a high profile embezzlement/fraud case while it's in progress, rather than digging for details after the fact.  However, that's a luxury I have because I was lucky/observant enough to dodge the bullet.  It was a sad day when I had to face facts and sell out last week.
Maybe I'll replenish my wallet/hopes if Gox and Karpales are publicly hanged or exonerated beyond a shadow of a doubt.   After so many colossal gagglefucks, guilty until proven innocent has become my philosophy in cryptocurrency.
As it stands now, cryptocurrency has a fatal issue with incompetence/malfeasance at the highest levels, with no way (I have seen) to control/police it.  The front facing image it is projecting to the world is:  the wild west.  Take, or be taken.
I don't want to do business in that environment.  It reeks of Wall St., and that's what I was looking to escape.

It's not really that a secure and immutable contract can't be written (nor are they mutually exclusive), it's simply that there is always a compromise between security and speed.
Security is relative, yes.  Code is never *completely* secure.
However, what you're talking about is semantics.  DAO ran off at the mouth with incorrect verbiage and were punished for their hubris.  There was no plan B in their contract, other than the delaying of the maturity of the child DAO.  It is almost definitely possible to create such a mechanism, even in Solidify... theDAO just didn't bother.
From this moment on, there will be a greater value placed upon security, and the community will not trust contracts written by lone, unknown webdevs (no offense intended).  Especially if it hadn't been completely vetted by reputable auditors.
Funny (to me) sidenote regarding the potential hardfork:
The Gox problem was centralized laziness/malfeasance.  Not the code or currency of Bitcoin.  Where did the people go for their recompense?  The Feds.
If the hardfork is adopted, it was actually the ETH community that acted as judge, jury and jailor.
The glaring issues with fungibility aside, I find it funny that ETH might be able to solve the issue itself, democratically, but the cryptoanarchist ethos of Bitcoin ran to the government for help.
Thanks for the reply.  Been seeing your comments all over the ETH subreddit. :)

Sounds like regulatory compliance to me!  Lol
@_date: 2016-06-16 14:01:15
See my sibling post for a brief explanation.
@_date: 2016-06-16 13:58:34
Used to work in compliance, specifically AML/BSA.  Sorry, ton of words coming...
There's a pretty blurry line between informing the client of a delay regarding a compliance investigation and what's known as "tipping off".
If a financial institution is found to have tipped off, the penalties are stiff.  Jail time and big fines to the person who did it, and potential loss of MSB licensure for the business.
Again, that line boils down to interpretation.  Most FIs won't say anything other than, "sorry for the delay," and nothing about compliance.
This is especially true if the investigator has found something they find to be suspicious.  What's suspicious is also muddy.  Could be that the amount is the "magic number" of 10,000.
Despite the rule that all **cash** deposits "larger than $10,000" must be reported, most suspicious activities like fraud, account takeover, etc are exactly $10,000, even if they aren't in the form of cash. 
If you get an overzealous AML officer or investigator, any transaction using that magic number is enough to set off a full investigation of the client.  If that investigator also finds your Facebook has pictures/posts of weed, gambling, etc... you're going to be the subject of a Suspicious Activity Report (SAR).  Regardless of how legitimate the activity **actually** is, it's all about how it **appears** to their AML people.
The red flags the investigator sees could be as nonsensical as an ID that was just a blurry picture that didn't look as crisp as the comparison from the book.  Or maybe the client's identity has been compromised (is an ID theft VICTIM) and the investigator can't tell which person they're dealing with.  Or even as stupid as "the client is uncooperative", which I've seen used by investigators that were pissed that the client was upset about all of the questions and requests for their firstborn.
Say again, it's all open to the interpretation of the investigator.
Once it is determined that a SAR will be filed, there's a wall of silence that goes up, and it's a tremendous pain to get your money back from the institution because they have no incentive to hurry.  The client might not get a response AT ALL to their calls or emails.  This is up to the policies of the company, and it's pretty fucked.
So glad I don't do that shit anymore.

Which method gives you more control of your trading balance.
Nevermind, you're barely reading my posts, and taking them out of context.
@_date: 2016-06-17 15:09:09
It's not that secure ETH contracts **can't** be built.
It's that theDAO rushed to be first to market (technically 2nd) and didn't audit the code in their contract.
As I understand it, a simple function to prevent use of tokens greater than the number of those held by the user could've prevented this.
They're suggesting all sorts of backward ass solutions to the exploit.  Pausing all ETH trading, hardforking to roll back tainted blocks...
It's the ETH version of Gox, imo.  The currency is fine, but the problem stems from centralisation.

Sunk cost of gfx cards is also a thing, but I agree that gfx cards can be repurposed to a point.
However... not so much by the current owner of the rig.  Very few need/can use more than 2 gfx cards.  The cards will be sold on eBay, just like old ASICs.
I'm an ETH miner because of the value that a functional ecosystem of smart contracts could provide in the future.  Those might not exist now, but I am not selling my ETH or tokens because I feel it's *possible*.
I can only provide my own example, but I think your question is definitely worth thinking about.

Not with the method I described.  
You place 1/3 of your funds that you're willing to trade ("if you positively MUST trade" btw) and use them at 3x their value.
You incur less risk of loss due to exchange failure.
You risk the same amount of your funds.  
Taking all of your money and using it for leverage is what you're talking about.  I don't recommend that at all.
Edit/disclaimer to satisfy Mr Judgmental below me:
  I can't put enough emphasis on "MUST" here.  There's a pretty narrow window of probability that will be correct for a newbie, but I'm not here to coach their trades.  I'm here to suggest a way to risk less, should the reader decide they are determined to trade.
At least this way the reader doesn't blow their whole wad on the market.  They probable control of what's on the market.. buy if the market for a rogue, the market doesn't have control of the readers tradable balance, just 1/3.

I'm not sure beta really applies to anything I named other than bitcoin, itself, and ethereum.
If you're going to apply beta to the ERC20 tokens, that would be due, mostly, to ethereum's movement.  Even then, I think interest in tokens may be the alpha here.
Feel free to correct me, but my general view of cryptoeconomics leads me to think that Bitcoin isnt as much of a factor on the space as it used to be.  It's still "the coin you know", but I'm not certain that it's got much else going for it in 2018 without pulling off some unforeseen miracle.
What can Bitcoin do (ideally) that I'm overlooking?
@_date: 2015-04-22 16:45:01
Why not?  Here's a few.
* **Known quantity**: The total number of bitcoins that can be mined has been preset at 21 million, whereas the amount of gold that can be mined is a more complicated question. 
* **Paper wallets:**  Bitcoin is a better alternative than gold because owning real, physical gold is expensive to store and transport, while spending and storing bitcoin is effectively costless.
* **Divisibility:**  They can be divided down to fractions such as one hundred millionth of a bitcoin.  The smallest useful unit of gold is a gram for around $45-60 dollars. You can’t make gold change for less than that.

Example of an agent provocateur;
10000 people gather for a peaceful protest.  The protest is, indeed, peaceful.
Agent provocateur enters the protest and stirs up shit by performing an act of violence to *provoke* the otherwise peaceful protesters to commit violence, or to make the protest appear to be violent.  
This agent provocateur has given the police what appears to outsiders to be a righteous reason to stop the protest and is usually a member of said police force.
In this case, the Satoshi impostor could have been used to discredit Gavin, and incite the core members to remove him from his post.

They use small amounts to find the tainted wallets (if they've got as robust of a AML department as they seem to have).

Nothing personal, but this has always worked for me using the mood of forum comments and reddit posts:
Buy it when it's a piece of shit that NOBODY would use, and sell it when a rally reaches the point of "if only 1% of"s start to get traction in online discussions.
Sold at 280 (5 for litecoin) on the last hump.
Surely... Anyone who'd buy my coins at 350 would buy them at 400.  
I'm waiting this one out, and not buying again until 230 or 320 has been tested twice.
Full disclosure:  I didn't buy back in after my firesale at 280.

Blows my mind that there aren't more legit gambling sites accepting altcoins.
Buy BTC from Coinbase or Circle, swap it out for other coins at whichever alt market seems the least skeevy, gamble your heart out, and cash out in reverse.
No mixing or other transactions.  Untraceable on the bitcoin  blockchain.

I agree with that, but we'll see how it works out for them.
I'm not entirely convinced that the choice to undo the DAO theft was a bad idea, however.
Lots of nascent techs are allowed to self-destruct due to a huge oversight, and I'm not sure that allowing that to happen is a net positive for society and technological advancement.
@_date: 2016-07-23 22:22:09
This is pretty great, and I didn't know much about it prior to your response.
I wasn't accusing you of CJ, just mentioning that both subs are borderline cultist and hostile.  For every awesome, on topic response like yours... I get 10 that are utterly useless, myopic, and hostile.
Thanks very much!
Side note:
Here's my project idea using ETH.  I fund a contract that is only patronized by four preselected addresses.  Two admins (me and the wife, multisigged for liquidation of the contract), and two other users who are only capable of receiving from, and incrementally re-depositing 10 tokens per week.
The tokens are verification of a completed chore.
Every Friday, the contract calls an Oracle that determines eth/USD pair value and then pays out ETH based upon that info, and the number of tokens deposited per user account.
Is this type of automation possible using the 21 libs? 
The fact that it's on-chain is more of a can-it-be-done/cryptographically verifiable exercise.
@_date: 2016-07-23 19:05:04
No worries.  It's a fairly useless appendage since they essentially hobbled its only use case... hence most people don't use it anymore or know about it.

Fact: It's different from bitcoin in philosophy and functionality.
Opinion: hurpderp it's junk.
I use BTC to pay for electronics and as a store of value, but I'm developing Dapps to help pay my kids an allowance with ETH.  They're both useful and have great potential.
Frankly, the strength of the circle jerk in each respective sub is so mind bogglingly huge that I almost never engage in them anymore.
Your nonsense sucked me in, and I already regret it.  Well played.
@_date: 2016-07-30 17:30:18
Don't shoot the messenger here, just providing info as to why they did this.  And, yes, I think it's philosophically wrong/borderline evil.
This is an AML thing, not a PayPal thing.
Charities are viewed as "high risk" due to the source of funds (donations) and the usual destination of those funds (what are known as "high risk jurisdictions").  Their logic (FinCEN or FATF, take your pick) is that terrorism is often funded useing the charity vector because of the above.
It's common practice to tell the customer it will take 24-48 hours, but they have (by law) 30 days to review the customer/case.
This is really sitty, but very common.  I hope they get it sorted.  I suggest you switch to BTC or Venmo for your funds transfers.  No AML crap there.
Can't help you with a way to easily collect donations or cash out in Romania, but I'm sure you can think of something.

@_date: 2016-07-24 00:52:04
That is not correct.  However....
Solidity isn't a good language for coding smart contracts, but the language, itself, wasn't the way the DAO was drained.
It was a reckless use of that language that allowed reentrancy to occur.
@_date: 2016-07-23 19:47:35
Even more so now.
@_date: 2016-07-23 20:18:29
It's interesting to me that the price went up 40% on what was essentially a total perversion of the core principles of the tech. 
It's possible that the do-over philosophy will ruin the experiment, but I'm willing to wait and see if the user base is smart enough to realize that the contracts need to be bulletproof and never become too big to fail. 
I'm not really concerned with the price, though.  I'm more interested in machine commerce 10 years from now.  Companies like 21 and currencies like ETH are a nice step in that direction.
BTC is currently leading the charge in security and convenience, but my interests lay in the future.  Interesting times. :)
Edit:. Just realized I used the word interest 100 times.  Forgot my thesaurus at home, I guess.

From an egalitarian standpoint, I wholly agree with you.  Smart people with time on their hands will learn and prosper.  Bitcoin being a challenge also underscores its youth.

Not shilling.  Just disappointed.  I've held BTC since 2013 and work as a consultant for FIs, brokerages and money transmitters.

Totally.  It's exciting, but vaporware at this exact moment.
If nothing else, ETH is a first mover in diversifying what money can do for machines, and in what machines can do with money.  It's really too bad that they may have blown their shot.  Here's to hoping they, and BTC have learned from their mistake.  Competition is key, imo.
I don't want to ever run out of milk again.  My fridge, and even my milk, should be able to solve that for me.  
Additionally, I want my votes to be heard and immutable, and I shouldn't have to wait in a line or show ID.  I know I'm me, and that's all I should need.  Question that?  Ask my milk.  :)

I only use them spareingly as an offramp when I need USD now.  They've never burned me, but its bound to happen sooner or later.

A small portion of the answer you're seeking:
XP is the most widely used OS in the world, and Microsoft is not patching it after April 14th, 2014.  It's already full of holes, but there's a lot of people in the world who are more interested in exploiting it now that they know their exploits will work indefinitely.
