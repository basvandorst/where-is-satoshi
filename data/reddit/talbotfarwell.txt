What happens when the AI decides that humans are inefficient, wasteful, destructive, and that it'd be better off without the drunken hedonistic meatsacks it's shepherding around?

My advice? Invest in lead, and trust in steel. "Not men, or women, but this." The Riddle of Steel.

A lockbox doesn't require electricity, nor does a pencil and scratch paper for arithmetic, or a pen and a ledger book for tracking transactions. "School/church bake sale" style.

What's to stop the Chinese government from seizing the Bitcoin mining operations' hardware and sending their own people in to operate them?

TBH I'm new to Bitcoin so I'm waiting for the price to drop before I make my first buy. I wanna get the best deal I can.

For me, it's a hedge on that. I'm leaning towards the likelihood that postmodern Western Civilization will collapse (due to a number of factors that I could hammer out whole essays about) within our lifetimes, but on the off chance it doesn't and everything turns out fine; crypto stands to provide a nice nest egg for me after thirty or forty years of HODLing.

What was that electricity worth to him, though? Was it put of his disposable income? What concerns me is when late adopters feel the need to jump on-board crypto if the dollar collapses - what's going to happen to people just hanging on by a thread, living paycheck to paycheck?

So what are their other options? Live in a rented shoebox-sized apartment in what amounts to a tenement for the rest of their lives, as the cities around us get progressively ever more gentrified and rents go up?
Some of us come from meager backgrounds and dream of being able to actually own something someday. That would be nice, wouldn't it?

I'm not a fan of crpyto by any means. I'll admit, I'm a strong crypto skeptic. I see it mainly as a long-term store of value (the "digital gold" analogy) and a hedge against the potential for hyperinflation of fiat currency. But even I'm not worried about power consumption, because y'know why? We're only a decade or two away from unlocking vast amounts of potential in new power sources. Tidal energy generation in coastal regions, additional new fission nuclear plants, Thorium fission plants, orbiting solar arrays that beam power back down to the surface, and eventually even nuclear fusion. Even fossil fuels are cleaner than ever, thanks to the widespread adoption of natural gas. I'm honestly not terribly worried how much electricity crypto miners use compared to EVs.

To be fair, Jesse James (not the chopper-builder) was an outlaw and a criminal in his time, and people remember him as a folk hero. Satoshi being a criminal might not necessarily be such a bad thing, if people see him as enough of a rebel against oppressive governments.

Inflation has risen since 1965 but real wages have remained stagnant, thereby causing working-class and middle-class people to devote more and more of their income to essentials instead of discretionary spending. In a consumer-driven system, how is that sustainable? 
Also, in your example, how do you explain hyperinflation and stagflation?

During sports games. You'd be targeting young, upwardly-mobile, tech-savvy guys in their mid-20s, the perfect time to get them thinking about adopting Bitcoin as a store of value for retirement.

I remember circa 2004-2006 when Young Jeezy, Lil Wayne, Birdman, and Mannie Fresh made those long white "dopeboy" t-shirts the coolest thing in the world for like two or three years there. Ah, sometimes I wish I could revisit the '00s.

As a working-class person, I've only ever seen inflation hurt me. Prices of essentials have gone up my entire life, but for long periods my pay stays the same. aside from getting a better paying job every few years or a meager raise once in a blue moon. I'd actually like my dollar to be able to buy *more* in the way of groceries, not less, so I'm not hurting for money after paying my rent every month.

How should a bitcoin n00b like myself buy, then?

I'm imagining a isolated encampment nestled deep in the Venezuelan jungle, not for turning coca leaves into cocaine, but to protect a hidden underground bunker containing a bitcoin mining ASIC farm. I'm trying to imagine a way you could get internet in and out of there without it being intercepted by the Maduro government... maybe by either satellite uplink, or a microwave direct line-of-sight transmission across the Brazilian border?

About time! One of the major things keeping me from taking more than a passing interest in crypto is that in my area it's particularly hard to find anyone who'll accept it for day-to-day purchases; be it groceries, gas, bill payments, fast food, entertainment, etc.  I want to be able to go to a gas station/mini-mart where I can buy sliced bread, cold cuts, cheese, and pickle slices for sandwiches, a bag or two of chips, maybe some mac n' cheese and some fried chicken, and some paper plates and disposable forks/spoons/knives for a picnic in the park with my family, a twelve pack of Yuengling, and a full tank of gas in my land yacht **all with fractional crypto**. Until then, crypto just isn't practical enough for normies like myself, except as an investment tool. This is a huge step in the right direction though, and very encouraging!

Shouldn't that price be denominated in Satoshis and not USD?

Yep. I'm HODLing mine for the next thirty or forty years *at the very least*. I'll definitely try to include a substantial portion in my will to my wife, my kids, any grandkids or great-grandkids or great-great-grandkids I might have.

You have a good point, but overconfidence is a killer. Right now we don't have anything that can counter China's DF-21 ballistic anti-ship missile.

Doesn't that end up having the knock-on effect of concentrating wealth in the hands of those already wealthy and cripple upward mobility for the working classes? I hope this doesn't come off as a stupid question, I'm relatively new to crypto and Bitcoin in general. 
@_date: 2018-10-18 23:12:05
True... solution: build a fake factory making widgets as a front-operation for the bitcoin bunker. Which is going to be rather tough to do in a centrally-planned economy, to say the least. 
Dammit, this is getting a whole lot more complicated. Fun while it lasted though!
