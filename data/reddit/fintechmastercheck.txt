Great answer. 
Let's hope we never do have to transition to a new development team because then what's to stop them from being infiltrated? lol

If you didn't notice, it merely rhymes. This is a throwaway, and thanks to crypto I don't need to work for others and am free to pursue an education full-time.
I told you to read my responses if you needed clarification as to what this post was about. I will feed you the link to said responses since I don't want to discriminate against the incompetent:
That being said, if you actually do finally decide to read, you will see the conversation has been resolved with the help of mature individuals. Thanks anyways.

I completely agree that the majority have good intentions, but why do officers get to transfer to new departments after "incidents" where they should be going to jail?
How come when they commit crimes and get sued by their victims, it's the taxpayer job to pay, instead of it coming out of their pensions. It's probably laughable for them.
If there are so many "good cops" that understand their position of power, how come they're more concerned with blue camaraderie? There shouldn't be any tolerance for these crazy police officers we read about if 99% of the other officers are competent enough. They wouldn't let them slip through.
Our system is very broken.

top comment, my response. 
Honestly, you replied 18 minutes ago and the comment I'm directing you to was posted 2 hours ago. You idiots are insufferable.

everything is interconnected. bitcoin is a sum of all important topics, don't be a simple minded bitch on my posts please.

Makes sense. I guess my question was along the lines of
"Is anyone else worried about the cognitive dissonance brought on by following this administration while simultaneously working on the most important advance in sovereign individualism..."
I am surprised the answer is no. Just feels like so much is at stake.

exactly what i meant by picking sides = not seeing the bigger picture.

That's reasonable but don't you think it \*is\* important where someones morals stand if they're going to be programmers in any field? Religion is (to an extent) a government psyop to get you to cooperate. Why are we not worried about conflict of interest here? 
Like I said, this administration and Christianity live off of fear. At what point will a government want to intervene, and SUCCESSFULLY do so in the name of f\*cking religion or of closed borders or something stupid?
