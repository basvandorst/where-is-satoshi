Yes. That's a great backing.
@_date: 2016-04-06 10:42:28
I understand the possible importance of having existing power structures using/building on Bitcoin to better allow it's usage to grow but damn if it doesn't make me nervous.
@_date: 2016-04-30 01:05:50
So if you're buying BTC it's a 7% fee and if you're getting fiat for BTC it's a 1% fee?
@_date: 2016-04-26 15:21:26
Hm. Did you have any BTC in Mycelium? Was this an issue when spending from a cold wallet? 
@_date: 2016-04-07 17:14:51
I've thought about this before...
Does this mean a certain percentage of BTC will never actually be "in circulation"? 
If so, the actual amount of BTC in possible-to-use circulation could be smaller. How much smaller is anyone's guess...
@_date: 2015-12-10 18:36:01
Not if you knew all this far in advanced. 
...(puts tinfoil hat on)....
A govt creates Bitcoin to destabilize every govt out there while investing heavily in it. World economy collapses, single govt who started Bitcoin with billions invested is now the richest country in the world.
....take off tinfoil hat....
I don't believe this is the case. I just created a situation where this could happen.

Currency inflation is no better for the poor or those on fixed incomes.
They both suck.
@_date: 2017-02-28 04:42:32


Like they did in China. Oh wait.  :|
@_date: 2017-03-14 04:08:52


Care to explain?
@_date: 2016-06-06 14:11:02
Use Mycelium?

Exactly! Make this happen!

My sides.

Windows ME is the reason I started using Linux.

Ugh a $129 Nano S...
@_date: 2016-11-07 21:15:37
Sadly I don't think I'll see any BTC...
@_date: 2016-12-07 11:47:27
So what about that .005 BTC I just bought which is to apparently appear in my account in a few days?
@_date: 2016-12-07 13:12:18
@_date: 2016-12-07 13:22:53
@_date: 2016-12-11 19:54:24
Especially with the cheapest ledger being what? $30 USD?
@_date: 2016-12-16 16:26:12
Any previews of what it may look like?
@_date: 2016-12-09 16:36:14
That's true. As I'm only buying I don't think having to buy from Coinbase would be the end of the world. But I would really like some better options.
@_date: 2019-08-05 23:52:46
Whats it take to be in the Bitcoin 1%?
@_date: 2016-12-07 20:08:48
Thanks for the update. As soon as I get an email telling me the BTC has hit my account I'll get it out of there ASAP.
@_date: 2019-10-16 02:44:16
My issue is say your pin is 12345. You will wear out buttons 12345 faster and thus show what numbers you pin potentially contains.
Dumb I know but still an issue.
@_date: 2016-12-16 16:26:43
I click "buy Bitcoins" and nothing happens. Not sure what I'm doing wrong.
@_date: 2015-08-08 16:20:29
Not saying it would be smart but couldn't someone do this with the intention of taking the money themselves? ie they wanted to move their bitcoin from one account to another without having to actually "send" it?
Does that make any sense or am I just piecing random words together?
@_date: 2017-04-27 20:51:44
Go here: 
And search by the public address you go it sent to. Give us a link to the results.
@_date: 2017-04-27 21:14:07
Nothing really. They are going to pay as low of a fee as possible (but high enough to still work) to maximize profits. They decide on the fee to pay when sending.
@_date: 2017-04-17 21:01:38


I don't gamble/do anything risky with money and thus know nothing about this - which is why I'm asking but why wouldn't someone just send BTC to their personal wallet before sending it to their casino/whatever?
Or does Coinbase watch this too?
@_date: 2017-04-27 20:44:37
Blockchain explorer link?
@_date: 2017-04-27 21:00:44
Thanks. So they paid 120 sat/B which is low. You'll get the BTC but it will take a day or so. Maybe two. 
@_date: 2016-09-06 16:22:29
I think his description better fits "Brave New World" by Huxley.
Which I also find more fitting today...
@_date: 2017-09-14 02:16:45
I would have a hard time trusting the idea of it - trusting someone else with my private keys.

Bitcoin somehow came up at work - I work with a bunch of 25 to 30 year old women. They all knew about Bitcoin. It was just "made up money" or "not real".
I'd bet thats the thought many people share.
@_date: 2015-09-26 19:27:53


Exactly what I said. If someone has an open mind about something such as Bitcoin, Ill gladly speak to them about it. If not, I don't waste my time.

Still can't withdraw BTC/ETC/Any crypto to a wallet. Only USD.

I've always wondered about using a raspberry pi to build a cold storage system...
@_date: 2016-05-27 15:52:28
The way I view it, Bitcoiners and Goldbugs are allies. Both are viewing and trying to fix the current system we live in. 
Yes. There are vast differences in mindset, however I think this is one of those "the enemy of my enemy is my friend" moments.
@_date: 2016-05-27 15:55:46
I would say it's more related to the recent yuan devaluations.
@_date: 2016-05-28 01:38:53
@_date: 2016-05-06 02:08:15
I'm curious about this. I see this better than a paper wallet.
@_date: 2017-05-19 00:22:23
Cumming? With a chance of cloudy?
@_date: 2015-10-21 01:08:52
I agree here. They have always responded to my emails quickly. They even sent me a "how are you doing? The problem is still fixed right?" email without me asking...
@_date: 2016-05-01 16:56:55
How did you notice it was stolen?
@_date: 2016-05-27 20:57:33
I would agree. When I refer to mindsets, I was more specifically referring to the technical slant most, if not all Bitcoiners have and the sometimes cautiousness some Goldbugs have in regards to technology.
I support both causes.
Want a crazy idea that combines both? Seeing how more gold is "created" via paper gold than actually exists, how about a ledger based system tracking how much gold is actually mined and owned?

He isn't saying to hold LTC. He is saying to use it as a transmission vector.
BTC --&gt; LTC --&gt; BTC could be much cheaper than just BTC --&gt; BTC.
@_date: 2017-06-15 07:45:09


Because you basically are. Yes, they deal in the crypto space but they need to follow all laws that govern what they do. Most of these are what banks follow too. They've done some shady stuff before, I'm not saying they are perfect, but they still must follow these laws and regulations. 
I wish we didn't need to convert to fiat but right now we have to. Sadly I think it will get worse as more laws are created.
