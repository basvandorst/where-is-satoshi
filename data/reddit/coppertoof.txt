Intangible assets will never replace tangible. Gold and silver holds value as a physical entity, but is valuable as a commodity for industrial electronics and commercial use. Gold in its ore format itself is fairly common, however it is the mining and refining industrial process that makes it so expensive. 
Bitcoin on the other hand lives on a selection of servers as code. In the event of a critical global network failure, physical gold will remain gold and bitcoin/crypto currency will remain, well.... offline. Doomsday scenario.

Being reasonably tech savvy, I have spent a few weeks researching the market and even attempted to poke a finger into Bitcoin investment, it is an absolute minefield.
I'm loving the idea of the financial revolution, however I find that the '5 reasons' statement is a little contrary to real life. The clear winners are the exchanges. Transaction fees are unnecessarily high and borderline extortionate. 
Buying bitcoin on the exchange is complicated. The sign-up process means that you have to submit/sacrifice valuable identification details such as passports or driving licences to God knows who, often in foreign countries. Your money is transferred into the void with a short prayer of hope. I'm amazed by the amount of Reddit users who are either scammed or fall foul of the buying/selling process. Many also comment on elaborate scams or lack of regulation often resulting in prospective buyers permanently losing coinage through inexperience or ridiculous T&amp;C's. 
Delivery times range from 5 days to the infinite and fraud seems rife with fake sites, exchanges, phishing and all sorts of shady shenanigans. Definitely a gamble investors market in current times.  More protection and insurance required before you digitise your hard earned currency I reckon.

Nowhere. It's bad photoshop.
