my family knows i’ve been making a reasonably insane amount of money for someone my age (17) off bitcoins and i️ won’t tell them how many i️ own but whenever they see good news like a spike in price they send me texts saying congrats ��

i️ only use coinbase (website and app) and i’ve never had issues, if i️ had more than 10k invested i’d buy a hardware wallet and keep it in a safe just to be safe

ok but you can still buy/sell in stores and with friends so yes it is a wallet, just not as secure
