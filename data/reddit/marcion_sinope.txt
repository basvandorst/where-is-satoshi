You seem defensive about Bcash.

Coinbase is rotten from top to bottom.
A stain on the crypto world.
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:20:24
Brian, you got in bed with Bcash scum and went all in on the Flippening gambit.

Ripple and Bitconnect are much better scams than Bcash and have higher returns. Bcash adds nothing to the space except confusion, attacks and FUD - enjoy the ride down and don't be sad when Roger leaves you holding the bag like he's done with so many other altcoins he pumped and dumped.

I'm going to overlook your deliberate non-capitalization of Christian and just let it go as unintentionally passive-aggressive for now.
We're getting a little off-topic but just so the record is clear, as a Marcionite, we don't put any stock in the Old Testament - in fact - we despise it. And that's probably going to leave 99% of your arguments and debate with a completely different group of people.
That gut feeling you get when you 'just know' you're missing something...something Big Picture big? The easy, empty path is to just dismiss it with glib comments about 'guys in the clouds' or the 'flying spaghetti monsters.' We each find our own intellectual/spiritual level in life, it's just the way of things.

Nobody would use that kind of thinking and rationale for trading those amounts or neglect to use stops and trailers (which aren't even mentioned in his story?).
Possibly believable if we moved some decimal points around and he lost 0.2 - doesn't pass the smell test. Not even close.
But if the goal of the story is to make people cautious about trading, yes it's a good story. My advice is don't trade, just hodl.

@_date: 2018-01-18 08:56:39
The simple fact is that we are at war with the entire global fiat system.
We didn't ask for war, we're simply moving on from a rigged game. Do you really expect them to give up their toys and walk away? No. And you should fully expect and mentally prepare for them to do everything possible to kill Bitcoin.
Whether that's propping up centralized shitcoins like Bcash or Eth, using CME and CBOE as weapons to drive down the price, prohibiting bank wires involving crypto, unleashing the full fury of the IRS or outright banning exchanges, you have to be ready for it - because it's all coming.
Each day will bring a new round of FUD and attacks - ignore it, tune it out, do not sell. In the short term, I highly recommend opening a couple accounts at credit unions as this plays out and the petrodollar (along with the central banks) implodes.

Their end game is to drive the price into the ground (using worthless fiat) and keep it there - see precious metals for hints.
Bitcoin (because it's truly decentralized and deflationary) represents an existential threat to the magic act of the global fiat system. Obviously, my best advice is don't trade, just hodl until the petrodollar and bonds implode.
They're going to do everything possible (I'm surprised the UN hasn't issued a global Bitcoin ban) to shake your faith. Hunker down and do not sell.

Anyone holding Bcash should be seriously concerned after watching this review of Roger's past.
Roger reminds me of other passionate people in history like...oh, I don't know...Jim Jones, David Koresh and whoever is running Scientology these days.
But the biggest concern for Bcash holders is that Roger may very well be going back to prison - he entered Japan on a St. Kitts passport without notifying immigration authorities of his felony record in the U.S.
What impact will that have on the value of Bcash? Seems risky.

They have KYC, the only difference is they may not be as thoroughly saturated with IRS workers.
For example, Coinbase tracks your coins after you buy them and remove them from the exchange. And that means under the law they are obligated (not that they feel forced) to file a FINCEN Form 111 if they even suspect fraudulent activity - even AFTER you removed your coins.
Coinbase is as Orwellian and statist as it gets. My recommendation is never KYC.

But don't worry, just in case you forget to tell the IRS, the FATCA law compels the foreign bank to report it for you. And they will -because if they don't they risk heavy fines.
It is easier for the banks to simply not open accounts for Americans. Not worth the hassle.

The threat to the banksters has always been the decentralized nature of bitcoin - and it will always represent an existential threat to them.
What we are witnessing is a 'pretend fight' between the politicians and Libra - it's a completely staged WWF event. Libra or some other centralized variant of it will ultimately be embraced by the plutocracy and given its 'blessing' for widespread (and tightly monitored and controlled) use by the unwashed masses.
The media propaganda machine will trumpet the new digital currency as a 'breakthrough for ordinary people' and the 'desperately unbanked.' There will be no deviation from accepting the agreed upon coin as the only true, legitimate coin.
Although not banned initially, bitcoin will be delisted from Coinbase and the other major centralized exchanges that fall under the purview of US authorities following (insert favorite flavor of false flag attack here).

Overseas ETN's are now being traded in USD and offered by domestic brokers - the rest of the world didn't wait around for the SEC and its slow-walking of ETF's.
Bitcoin is global and not dependent on the whims of regional bureaucrats and their bankster handlers - that is one of its strengths.

Yes, when fiat interaction is unavoidable you're better off with a credit union.
Banks exist solely to make money off depositors and perpetuate the fractional reserve fiat Ponzi. Thus, inherently, a hostile predator-prey relationship.
Credit unions pay dividends to their members on any profits made. Big difference.

It's a halfway decent flame war on Twitter between these two. 
 Canada - "Stop picking on women and (blah blah, human rights)." 
Saudi Arabia - "Stop meddling and worry about your suppression of your own indigenous peoples."
Now here's what really happened and what they really want to say...
Canada - Some snowflake at their foreign affairs office got bored at lunch and decided to do some freelance virtue signaling on the official government Twitter account.
Saudi Arabia - "You are a frozen land of nobodies. Our revenge on you will RISE like Cobra and soon will ATTAC !! Beware or we will RELEASE COBRAS and all WILL BE reveal!"

Credit unions can only lend out what people deposit into their credit union. Credit unions cannot create money out of thin air through fractional reserve banking.

The more difficult and complicated the U.S. makes things, the more wide open the playing field becomes for bitcoin-friendly countries.
Not only will the bitcoin leave (nobody wants to set up shop here as it is and U.S. customers are banned from most exchanges), but the owners will as well. It's inevitable and the smart ones have already left or are exploring which country to go to - the environment coupled with the onerous KYC is simply too hostile.

The failed coup in Venezuela was closely tied to senior officials in the US government, The Observer has established. They have long histories in the 'dirty wars' of the 1980s, and links to death squads working in Central America at that time.

I had one in the bathroom a couple months ago, you would be amazed at how they can contort their fat asses to get through the smallest holes. Somehow made it through the subfloor near the shower drain pipe.
Had to pry off part of the wall to even see him and then he pretended he was invisible. So he's in a narrow area, I can't reach him and even if I could I'm not going to grab him, he had some size to him. I decide to wait him out and research what my next move should be - so I leave the lights on and play some loud music.
24 hours goes by and I continue to use the bathroom as usual and he's not budging. I spray him with vinegar, really soaked him. Nothing. Some poking with a broom. Nada. Barely even a reflexive response. Stalemate.
The night of the second day all hell breaks loose - crashing, scratching, things breaking and falling. I grab the pole (Kabar knife ready just in case) and crack the door open. He climbs up the doorway so he's almost eye-level with me and jams his paw in the opening so I can't close the door.

Yes, that's why interest rates were cut. Because the economy is doing so well and unemployment is so low.

The creation of the VAU was announced by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Wednesday. The new body will replace the basically non-existent US embassy to Venezuela – but it will only communicate with the Washington-propped Guaido, not the country's actual government of President Nicolas Maduro."

I predict a quasi-amnesty at some point.
Come clean now, divulge everything - transactions, names of exchanges, total amounts, number of coins held outside of exchanges - no tricks or lies - and we'll assess a x-percent penalty on your holdings.
With a much clearer picture of who you are and where you've been they can then cross-match transactions done with any company in the U.S. 
This reminds me of the 'amnesty' done with FATCA and FBAR in which people with foreign bank accounts (e.g., somebody teaching English in South Korea) were screwed and glued once the camel's nose got under the tent.

"Google's leaked paper showed that its quantum processor, Sycamore, finished a calculation in three minutes and 20 seconds — and that it would take the world's fastest supercomputer 10,000 years to do the same thing.

This is a psyop story to get you used to seizures and forfeitures.

He's a wrinkly rat poison merchant that got a free ride on a manipulated economy and banking system based on a Ponzi scheme.
He's nobody's hero.
@_date: 2019-02-04 17:11:17
Mhm, pretty much the *last* thing we need right now.
@_date: 2019-02-19 17:40:50
CME couldn't suppress the price forever and the banksters ran out of Mt. Gox coins to dump on the exchanges.
@_date: 2019-02-08 00:26:45
Yeah, it's called a Ponzi Scheme, but if you're more comfortable using the word 'banking,' that's fine, too.

Individuals own shares in the Fed directly or through front companies - just like investing in any other company.
Is this the part where you tell us we can buy stock in say, the Department of Education? How about the Bureau of Land Management maybe? The answer, of course, is no.
I'm not sure what you're trying to accomplish with all this obfuscation and word games but it's entertaining.
@_date: 2019-06-14 17:50:41

Sorry, I was counting all my Bitcoin Classic and tallying my Mt. Gox winnings. What?
@_date: 2019-02-27 14:59:32
Not really.
It's just that the mask is finally starting to come off Fedbase.

When these reptiles get caught and outed they just post the same propaganda under a new name. But they usually wait a couple days, they must be real excited about this one for some reason.

Weaponized marketing tactics and subterfuge were skills honed by Ver during his extended stay in our federal prison system before buying a Caribbean passport and fleeing the country.
My understanding is he's using his fake Bitcoin site name to sign up social media trolls for contract work.

London is the most surveilled Orwellian city on the planet, a bitcoin ATM is the least of their problems.
@_date: 2017-11-17 06:05:17
The whole orchestrated scam was sickening on many levels.
Within the exchange I trade on there were people using the chat box to willfully and malevolently convince others to dump their real Bitcoin for these bcash commiecoins. They *knew* what would happen to anyone that listened to them. That's just sick.
I can't even fathom that level of malignant depravity.

I know this isn't a popular viewpoint but I don't trust these hardware wallets.
How do you know there isn't something baked into the firmware? And if there isn't, wouldn't a governmental agency keen on knowing who has bitcoin simply get a database of everyone who bought them (naturally because they need to save the children and for our protection)?

Roger is in Japan on a visa as a citizen of St. Kitts.
To get the Japanese visa he would have to supply them with a police record affirming his good conduct. And because it would be a police record provided by St. Kitts he would look 'clean.'
However, the Japanese immigration authorities wouldn't be aware that Roger is in fact a convicted felon who spent time in the US federal prison system before fleeing the country and purchasing his St. Kitts citizenship.
Roger is willfully stealing money and ruining lives with forethought and malice. The Japanese and St. Kitts immigration authorities should be made aware of this so they can take appropriate action.
Having lived and worked in Basseterre for a number of years doing local government contract work I would be surprised if his citizenship wasn't revoked after a second, closer look.

The US is Ground Zero for the global Fiat Ponzi - the dollar is the de facto world currency - and you think the *censored* running the show are going to let bitcoin have a level playing field?
The US Treasury isn't even allowed to print its own debt-free currency (the last time they tried was 60-years ago and we all know how that turned out) so what makes you think bitcoin will be allowed to bypass the Fed?
Not. Happening. All the tools of the *censored* will be arrayed against bitcoin in ever-increasing stages of friction and hostility.

First of all, this is from Al Jazeera, the news outlet owned by the government of Qatar.
The central bank in Qatar has banned bitcoin as we see here...
"The central bank explained that in order to ensure the safety of the financial and banking system, all banks operating in the country are not allowed to deal in any way with this currency or exchange it with any other, or open accounts to deal with it or send or receive any money transfers for the purpose of buying or selling this currency."
And just to give you an idea about Qatar, they funneled billions of dollars to terrorists attempting to overthrow the government of Syria. Moreover, they host the largest U.S. military base in the Mideast.
It's a gas station managed by bankers masquerading as a country. Their hatred of bitcoin shouldn't be a surprise - and it shows in the propaganda put forth by Al Jazeera.

Yeah, the more I thought about it, the less likely it became.
Think about the dialogue between the scammer and somebody who is even marginally aware of what bitcoin is. How far into the story do we get before the victim tells him that Coinbase set his limit to $15 and his KYC is taking longer than expected?
Not plausible.

These machines don't dispense bitcoin. And they certainly don't dispense it by dumping your spare change in it.
You put in some paper, then it gives you back some paper with somebody's website address on it.
You go home to your computer and log in there. Then you upload all of your personal financial information and identification to the website. Also, they need you to take a selfie holding up your ID cards. Because terrorists. Or children. Anyway, you'll need to that.
Okay, now you fill out some forms. After some time, there is no set time, hours, days, who knows - the website will ask you for some numbers on the paper the machine gave you.

Verdict: Irrelevant.


Verdict: Shill.
Banks are for-profit enterprises that go out of their way to report your transactions (and their personal suspicions) to government authorities. Do bank employees receive a bounty for customers that are successfully prosecuted? Nobody is talking but it's widely accepted as true.
Similar to bounties are paid by the IRS when you rat on a neighbor or relative.
Credit unions are not operated like banks and any profits generated are paid back to members (shareholders).
Your failure to mention this is either deliberate and/or you're lying about working for a credit union.
Cumulative Verdict: Asshole.

Bitcoin represents an existential threat to the global fiat Ponzi and futures are but one tool of many they have to keep the price suppressed.

The banksters won't be able to suppress the price forever, looks like they're losing control now. Fake CME paper futures can only do so much.
@_date: 2019-01-27 14:52:19
And I think much, much more.
@_date: 2019-01-22 13:32:11
Any system based on fractional reserve banking is a Ponzi scam and will achieve the same 100% failure rate that ALL unbacked fiat does. These are the facts and they are undisputed.
Currently, the US dollar has lost 98% of its value since 1913 and I recommend you only keep in the bank what you can afford to lose.
Yes, the price of bitcoin is being suppressed by the banksters and their paper futures games at CME and CBOE but that strategy won't work as more and more people head for the exits.
Global fiat debt stands at $244 TRILLION dollars - you don't want to be on that boat when it finally slips under the waves and drowns your 'investments.'
Bitcoin is sovereign wealth untouchable by the banksters and government regimes - you can't have too much of it.

These are half-measures that will achieve nothing except waste a lot of time and energy.
These countries need to take off the skirt and just go full bitcoin and stop screwing around if they want a successful, positive economic outcome. Also, they will see an influx of new, high quality Western people looking for a bitcoin-friendly country that fits their needs.

You do realize how widespread and cookie-cutter this save the world marketing angle is, right?
Just switch the product line from clothing to cell phone cases or room freshener spray - same thing. It's all plug 'n play right down to the charity that may or may not be getting a cut of the sales. Really, you should be intellectually insulted by this things like this.
In any event, you will notice I thanked the OP for accepting Bitcoin. As for your last point I'm not sure what that even means - 'improving the image of crypto.' Like what, more cat pictures, little bitcoins nestled in a field of softly-flowing lotus flowers?

As far as I know, the Constitution hasn't been rewritten to assume guilt and require people to prove innocence. Yet.
And that does away with most of your premise.
Most people do not underreport out of fear of an IRS audit. It is during the audit when proof must be supplied, not before. The IRS does get records prior to an audit or filing when, depending on the asset, a financial threshold is reached e.g., Paypal generates a tax form when $20K in transactions is breached over the course of a year.
But you seem to be advocating for blanket IRS reporting.

ETF's are the only thing that will balance the futures market and bring about true price discovery as opposed to the downward manipulation and rigging we currently have.
CME has been fucking Bitcoin over on a free ride since December.
@_date: 2018-02-14 01:36:42
e.g., 'productive assets' that aren't decentralized?
Yeah, I get it.
@_date: 2018-02-26 17:10:11
Isn't he Roger Ver's close personal friend?
@_date: 2018-02-07 18:21:14
And Facebook banned Bitcoin ads (to appease China).
We have a social media problem that would make George Orwell cringe.
@_date: 2018-03-07 19:37:30
Careful, the Bcash zombies will call you a 'Nazi.'
@_date: 2018-11-03 01:41:13
I'm always so glad I use Electrum when I read these posts.
Anyway, hope it gets fixed and you are reunited with your coins.
@_date: 2018-02-23 02:43:49
I hear some *BeeeCassshhh* bass pumping in the background.
@_date: 2018-02-28 18:15:58
You meant Bcash.

I'm a no-tar pragmatist, Stalin.
@_date: 2018-02-09 22:06:38
A decade of debt monetization (e.g., Zimbabwe) isn't going away.
Bitcoin will remain long after your confetti fiat is gone.

Somewhere, a boot is missing its licker.
@_date: 2018-02-27 23:43:15
That's the thing about ambiguity.
@_date: 2018-02-03 12:15:07
Much, much worse.
Limit down.
@_date: 2017-10-27 15:15:31
You're right, the B2X attack is a Trojan horse for the central banks to take control and kill decentralization.
With trillions on the line I think the battle has just started.
@_date: 2017-10-23 18:22:44
Yuuuuge market.
@_date: 2018-03-14 14:23:18
Are you distancing yourself from this post?
@_date: 2017-10-25 06:58:31
During a class action lawsuit aren't all funds frozen until a federal magistrate decides on disbursement?
Having any money in the same zip code as Coinbase looks like a really bad idea right now. One of two possible outcomes - You get B2X or get your money tied up in never-ending litigation.
No thanks.
@_date: 2018-02-26 23:36:12
People say lots of things during a bankruptcy hearing, bro.

IMF scrip will be next.
@_date: 2018-03-24 17:29:31
It's cute how the banksters assume such authority and power over Bitcoin.
Time better spent planning for the petrodollar implosion beginning 3/26.
@_date: 2018-03-24 21:09:30
In addition, the gold-based Petroyuan starts trading on 3/26, marking the end of the Petrodollar era.
US dollar and bonds are dead man walking. Bitcoin is the safe haven.
@_date: 2018-03-08 15:59:24
Bad news for Bcash and the Chicom mining gangsters.
@_date: 2017-10-26 12:45:26
I thought it was when you create money out of thin air.
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:22:44
The Fed has been monetizing debt for a decade and now the chickens are coming home to get beheaded.
This is a scam that is not possible with Bitcoin. BTC is the safe harbor.
@_date: 2018-02-22 05:17:57
Without ETF's it does.
Stay silent and learn.
@_date: 2017-10-29 16:24:26
I can tell by the way it's written.
@_date: 2018-02-23 09:45:54
Only the government has the power of the IRS and civil asset forfeiture.
The question still stands. Unlike your spineless worshipping of authority.
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:49:03
Buy it and forget about it.
When fiat implodes you'll be glad you did - you are insured against the banksters and the government psychopaths.
@_date: 2018-02-13 07:22:17
Roger Ver is the real Jim Jones.
Another scammer headlining for another cult.
@_date: 2018-02-04 07:14:15
Relax, it's just CNN with a tan and different accent.
@_date: 2018-02-28 19:53:10
Roger's cut-and-paste Bcash airdropped sleazecoin is the real Bitcoin - and he stores your mnemonic seed phrases in an unencrypted text file.
I know he's not a coder and his only ties to the digital space were running scams on Ebay, but exactly how stupid is this guy? Didn't he learn anything in federal prison?
I feel sorry for the Bcash bagholders - each day must be like waiting for the other shoe to drop (much like the price).

I was trying to find words to encapsulate their whole 'thing' and it just came to me suddenly.
@_date: 2018-02-23 11:18:12
Well, in retrospect it wasn't fair to the worms.
I think I was trying to express fluidity of movement and ended up unintentionally dissing the worms. Totally my bad there.
@_date: 2018-02-08 00:41:52
They're called forks. Learn something.
@_date: 2018-02-05 09:53:04
Glad I'm in Bitcoin - the banksters and government can't lay a fat finger on it.
Watching the fiat funeral pyre go up in flames will be entertaining.
@_date: 2018-02-03 09:10:48
Bag holding isn't much of a life, son.
@_date: 2018-03-02 00:17:57

Relax, they'll make everyone whole again by paying them in 2X.
@_date: 2017-10-30 16:52:56
Should have a "I'm feeling lucky" button to represent the other altcoins.
@_date: 2017-10-24 14:14:08
One wonders what kind of poison pill, backdoor or other fun surprise he coded into 2X.
And I guess I'm not the only one wondering.
@_date: 2017-10-25 16:10:05
Get your money out of Coinbase, Xapo and Gemini before the S2X attack or it will be frozen in endless litigation during the class action lawsuits.
@_date: 2017-10-27 21:38:51
How much for one rib?

Wall Street is imploding and Black Monday Limit Down is just a day away.
The smart money is flooding into the Bitcoin safe harbor right now.
@_date: 2018-02-04 19:01:54
Unfortunately, you and others of your ilk are about to find out the hard way why Bitcoin exists.
Leaving yourself to the tender mercies of the banksters has never gone well. For anyone. Ever. And tomorrow there will be much wailing and gnashing of teeth while the Bitcoin holders find refuge.

Hold on, I can't hear you over all the endorsement money.
(Are you serious?)

Oh, so that's what you call it when the Fed buys stocks and bonds using money printed out of thin air.
@_date: 2018-02-04 19:17:23
It already is a refuge.
And it already happened. Good luck, sucker.

The picture is much larger than the one you see on the Cartoon Channel.
Keep the placebo.

It's called a hint.

Is that why he went to jail or was that for something else?
@_date: 2017-10-16 19:27:28
Don't worry, nobody else knows what you're talking about either.
@_date: 2017-10-22 03:32:01
The 2X and Bcash merchants are an alien and corrosive element within the ecosystem.
Truly, the Bolsheviks of the cryptocurrency world. A defensive preemptive strike is more than called for here - they're openly telling you their plans to attack.

Sorry, I don't speak Zimbabwean.
"European markets seen sharply lower amid global selloff"
*grabs some popcorn* I'm a little distracted right now watching the fiat dumpster fire this morning. Good luck :)
@_date: 2018-02-05 06:43:48
A bull market for the last decade? LOL
Is that what you call ten straight years of monetizing debt? You're not only delusional, you're a danger to yourself and others.
Zimbabwe just called and they want their trillion dollar bills back.
@_date: 2017-10-27 18:39:39
Any groups exist that you could donate money to and would then apply it to running more nodes?
@_date: 2017-10-31 21:31:07
Bcash is just one in a long line of failed scam coins courtesy of convicted felon, Roger Ver.
You're making yourself look very foolish with this propaganda nonsense.
@_date: 2018-02-24 17:06:55
Partially because of overall awareness and disgust with the fiat ponzi scheme.
@_date: 2018-02-07 18:28:19
I wouldn't lump everyone with the name of Roger into one basket of sin.
@_date: 2018-03-23 17:47:13
People still use Fakebook?
@_date: 2018-03-28 17:49:11
Centralized Paypal coin.
It's not complicated.
@_date: 2017-10-16 04:19:35
Words that were as true then as they are now - perhaps more so.
Time to end the 2X scam.
@_date: 2018-02-17 06:58:56
Tell them you never did a transfer and close the account.
@_date: 2018-02-05 09:26:12
When you think about it, Bitcoin is like 3-4 coins in one.
@_date: 2017-10-13 13:28:46
I trade with Bitmex and I see my decision was the correct one.
Had their statement been different I would have closed the account.
Good job, Bitmex!
@_date: 2017-10-12 06:56:50
Reminds me of the character, Ash, in the movie 'Alien' after being whupped upside the head with a baseball bat.
Time to pull the plug on B2X, SX2, Bcash2 or whatever they're calling it today.
@_date: 2017-10-21 15:53:07
It's very, very clear.
Once you strip away the drama, histrionics and multiple layers of flim-flam, Bcash and S2X are just back-alley power grabs and scams.
Most exchanges understand this and have said NO2X but Coinbase needs to hear it loud and clear from each of us - directly.
@_date: 2017-10-27 23:41:55
Okay, that's a viewpoint I hadn't considered.
@_date: 2017-10-27 16:15:33
Personal preference after reading up on things.
@_date: 2017-10-27 16:11:19
Yeah, I think he'd rather talk about anything except that.
Next will be a typo he found which 'outrageously skews and taints the entire study.'
@_date: 2017-10-14 12:13:39
The more we learn about 2X the worse we realize it is.
These guys are just throwing shit at a wall and calling anything that sticks a success.
@_date: 2017-10-25 16:57:19
Actionable fraud.
@_date: 2017-10-27 21:05:11
You got any more of that?
@_date: 2018-03-18 17:19:10
Or worse, Bcash.
@_date: 2018-03-02 22:45:52
We're premining it at the tech incubator right now - get in cheep!

There have been very few times in my life when I've been absolutely left speechless.
This is one of them.
Only now do I realize that Janet Yellen wasn't kidding when she admitted she had no idea what causes inflation.
@_date: 2017-10-30 21:06:50
Those valuations exist only at the whim of the Fed which has been artificially propping up the stock and bond markets with their magic fiat which, you will now agree, is created out of thin air.
And without the largesse of the Fed, VTSAX, S&amp;P500, the Russell 5000 and all the rest of the alphabet indices would be a toilet swirl.
I hope you have a plan for when the magic show is canceled.
Edit: 'Quantitative easing' is actually called debt monetization. Hear that sound? Zimbabwe is calling.
@_date: 2018-03-10 04:24:23
What we do know is that what we're being told isn't the whole story.

But +1 FUD.

Spot on. I would only add for the new people that when it dipped under the Mendoza line, well, it's pretty crystal clear where that move was headed.
Do we need to dress them in the morning as well? The market is GIVING you money.
@_date: 2017-10-27 15:01:37
The analogy works regardless of which way you travel in the time machine and use 2% value as a baseline.
@_date: 2018-02-24 04:26:45

The IRS probably has a couple agents working there on site full time.

So is that building behind him.
@_date: 2017-10-27 09:20:01
I see you're concerned and upset about where the sentence was placed in the study.
@_date: 2018-02-03 17:33:52
Friedman is almost a bigger fraud than Einstein.
Getting a job as a clerk in the Swiss patent office and stealing ideas is a whole new level that Milton didn't get to.
@_date: 2017-10-16 13:47:37
So you made more by not buying at the top - that's good.

And another one wanders over from the rbtc reservation.

One of them must be turned.

Wouldn't it be easier to just send your Bitcoin directly to Garzik?
@_date: 2017-10-24 18:03:03
Nice that they get you real BTC and get rid of the trash coins without having to jump through hoops.
@_date: 2018-02-22 04:11:59
The more the US issues sanctions, the more the crypto community grows.
Probably not what they intended.

The banksters trying to kill off Bitcoin again as their fiat Ponzi scheme unravels.
@_date: 2018-02-28 22:52:23
The cabal is protective of their fiat Ponzi scam and the mask is coming off.
Walling off the exits.
@_date: 2018-02-15 23:41:07
Does this mean shorting Bitcoin at 5,900 was a bad idea?
My trade before that was buying Bcash at 4,400. Sometimes I secretly wonder if I should stop trading.
@_date: 2017-10-28 22:28:17
Wow, you don't just drink the Kool Aid, you shower in it.
@_date: 2017-10-13 18:51:26
I wonder if you can short it all the way into negative digits.

Tell them to buy a printer and just make their own fake money like the Fed does.
@_date: 2017-10-16 14:53:02
Shapeshift is a supporter of the 2X scam and there is a better alternative in the form of Changelly.
Not complicated.
@_date: 2017-10-18 14:29:15
Slime trifecta.
@_date: 2017-10-16 14:46:17
Coinbase never met a federal regulatory hoop (KYC/AML) it wasn't eagerly willing to jump through yet is associating itself with the 2X scam.
@_date: 2018-02-19 19:02:23
They'll create their own fake (centralized) version of Bitcoin and then outlaw the real one with a global ban announced by the IMF or the UN in concert with the central banks.

You couldn't be more wrong.

You live in snowflake world and I have a zero-tolerance level for apparatchiks like you.
@_date: 2019-09-04 14:05:48
Guys like you are a dime a dozen except they usually say they shorted at 19.
We both know you shorted 9.6 and are underwater, desperately throwing good money after bad trying to get your entry higher. You'll drown for sure - but at least you'll be wearing your favorite drool cup.
@_date: 2018-02-10 02:00:56
I was talking about Bcash doing a toilet swirl right now.
You didn't buy at $4,400 did you? That would suck.
@_date: 2018-02-07 17:10:46
The fiat ponzi scheme is quickly coming to a close and even the herd knows it now.
The central banks tried their best to deliver Bitcoin the kill shot and they failed. We are now witnessing the flippening from fiat to BTC.
To Hodl is to survive the coming creative destruction.
@_date: 2018-02-18 18:19:47
If either of these exchanges are the answer I don't want to know what the question was.
@_date: 2018-02-28 16:54:25
'Quantitative easing' is just a slick way of describing monetizing debt. Think Zimbabwe or Weimar Republic and trillion dollar bills and wheelbarrows full of money to buy a loaf of bread - same thing, same outcome.
Bitcoin is the safe haven against what the banksters are doing.
@_date: 2018-02-08 16:13:28
Telling everyone to buy at 20K because CME was bullish and then telling those same people to sell at 6K...well...
I follow Richard for his technical insights, not trading advice.

Never bring a mouse pad to a gunfight.
Garzik, Silbert and the rest of the magic chicken-twirlers are attempting a hostile takeover at the behest of their central bank handlers. It's a war and the sooner 2X is buried the better.
@_date: 2018-02-09 22:57:45
You mod there?
@_date: 2017-10-26 12:59:01
I hope they did.
I hope they stuck a digital shiv into the B2X scammers nice and deep...then twisted it on the way out.
@_date: 2017-10-14 12:17:35
They're going to have to do something with cryptos and doing something means entering the ecosystem.
Entering the ecosystem means +1 Good for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-02 17:47:18
You meant Bcash.
@_date: 2018-02-07 17:02:54
@_date: 2017-10-27 15:58:05
Wrong, wrong and wrong.
But this is right: "today you can only buy 2% of what you could buy in 1913 with $1.00."
@_date: 2017-10-21 17:40:27
If no ID, no hassles, no hoops, no wait - doesn't sound that bad.

One isn't. My lifeboat floats, does yours?

Well, at least he doesn't go around Swatting people that get in the way of his plans.
It was probably a clerical oversight.
@_date: 2017-10-25 06:27:51
There's going to be a tectonic plate of lawsuits coming for Coinbase because of this - definitely wouldn't want any money anywhere near them right now.
"Unable to release funds while litigation is pending..." Huge mess.

Well, that was his first mistake right there.

Hi, can you print me some money out of thin air when you get an extra minute?

Keep calm and hard fork (Brexit).

Sorry, a little tough to hear you over the sound of the markets losing 4 Trillion Dollars in the last few days.
The one day record-breaking 1,600 freefall in the DOW was a hint of what's right around the corner if the Fed eases up on debt monetization (e.g., Zimbabwe-style QE) again.
Deflationary, decentralized Bitcoin is the only lifeboat.

So, the short answer is it's backed by nothing.
But, perhaps by accident, you mentioned something about inflation - and you might find it interesting that Bitcoin is immune to inflation and, in principle, infinitely divisible although eight decimal places are currently allowed for.
And that means there's plenty to casually toss at all the peasants and serfs on the way to a ballroom - plenty for everyone and no coin-shaving necessary.
You're obviously intelligent, which is why I'm confused you would promote a currency that has lost 98% of its value in the last 100 years.
Surely your empire will last longer than that.
@_date: 2019-09-10 02:25:00


No. So far, so bad.
Let's think about this. Web wallet. Web wallet? Yeah. Anyway, your problem is with the mysterious web wallet and/or the unnamed trading platform, not with the email provider. That's like saying Intel conspired to steal your bitcoin because one of their chips was on the motherboard.

When the Fed pumps trillions in fake money into Bitcoin like they do stocks and bonds then, yes, we'll be in a bubble.
Some say that the price of Bitcoin is a measurement of how inversely worthless the dollar has become - and if true - the US economy is already in Stage 1 hyperinflation. What they're doing is called debt monetization (they gave it the warm and fuzzy name of 'Quantitative Easing QE) and it's exactly how Zimbabwe and Weimar Germany ended up where they did.
Granted, Germany was a little different because of the criminal Versailles Treaty dictates, but the endgame is the same - wheelbarrows of worthless fiat to buy a loaf of bread. Add the quickly approaching demise of the petrodollar and it's buh-bye time.

I disagree on the intelligence part; they're pretty smart and they know exactly what they're doing and what their goals are.
This isn't the right subreddit for a deep dive on Venezuela's socioeconomic challenges but they're a country sitting on the largest oil reserves on the planet and they, in the eyes of the State Department, have committed the unpardonable sin of nationalizing their resources and are not trading said resources in U.S. dollars.
They also support Palestinians and booted the Israeli embassy from the country - which I'm sure played no small role in the appointment of Elliott Abrams to lead the latest charge in toppling the government.

Yeah, in 1913 it was worth 100 cents, now it's worth 2 cents.
So if I time traveled back to 1913 I could buy 2% of stuff with today's dollar. It's printed out of thin air and backed by nothing - that change came in 1913 with the Fed creation.
Some say that Bitcoin's value is a reflection of how worthless the dollar really is - and if true it means we're already in hyperinflation - an economy propped up with toothpicks, smoke and mirrors.

Richard is a classic study in not tying your passion in a subject too closely to a media personality.
And possibly a study in why media personalities shouldn't tie their egos too closely to people on the internet.
I like Richard despite his recent acting out and think maybe he had a couple misreads of the market (e.g. CME is super bullish for Bitcoin) and let a few Twitter trolls get under his skin. The people who like him let that slide but he only heard from the negative feedback crowd.

"We will tame bitcoin." - Melamed, CME
Paper futures are the oldest scam in the book when it comes to full spectrum price suppression. Literally the minute CME started trading bitcoin (again, literally the minute) BTC tanked. Coincidence? There are none when the banksters want to put down a perceived threat like bitcoin.

Funny you mention sweating...
*The series revealed the lengths Amazon was prepared to go to keep costs down and output high and yielded a singular image of Amazon’s ruthlessness—ambulances stationed on hot days at the Amazon center to take employees suffering from heat stroke to the hospital. Despite the summer weather, there was no air-conditioning in the depot, and Amazon refused to let fresh air circulate by opening loading doors at either end of the depot—for fear of theft.*
*On July 25, with temperatures in the depot reaching 110 degrees, a security guard reported to OSHA that Amazon was refusing to open garage doors to help air circulate and that he had seen two pregnant women taken to a nursing station. Calls to the local ambulance service became so frequent that for five hot days in June and July, ambulances and paramedics were stationed all day at the depot. Commenting on these developments, Vickie Mortimer, general manager of the warehouse, insisted that “the safety and welfare of our employees is our number-one priority at Amazon, and as general manager I take that responsibility seriously.” To this end, “Amazon brought 2,000 cooling bandannas which were given to every employee.*

A bushel of Pinocchios for IRS’s Lois Lerner
But then it gets worse...
"In some ways, this is just scratching the surface of Lerner’s misstatements and weasely wording when the revelations about the IRS’s activities first came to light on May 10. But, taken together, it’s certainly enough to earn her four Pinocchios."
Perhaps the Washington Post made a mistake and has since retracted the story?
But then even Factcheck.org weighed in after an investigation and found her and more IRS officials lying as we see here...

The central banks have an unlimited supply of fake money to drive the price down and when they hurriedly inserted CME and cash-settled futures it was Game Over.
But perhaps in a gentler parallel universe they would allow an existential threat such as Bitcoin to just flitter along on its merry way completely unmolested and we, left to their tender mercies, would enjoy our decentralized assets.

"Also, the US passport is arguably the most powerful passport in the world, giving you access to the most countries compared against any other."
Factually incorrect. Also, you're more likely to be singled out and executed in the event of a terrorist attack because of the U.S. passport.
"Most people I know that want to renounce citizenship here have never actually lived in another country before. It's really interesting actually."
I guess we'll have to take your word for that. I, on the other hand, have actually lived and worked in multiple countries and I can tell you that isn't the case.
Moreover, I'm still forced to pay taxes without even spending a single day in the U.S. after being gone on assignment for many years. That's right, it's a IRS tax law called FATCA - forcing us to pay taxes and self-report all of our bank account information under penalty of jail and hundreds of thousands in fines.
Additionally, overseas banks refuse to open a bank account for U.S. citizens and potential employers shun them - because of the IRS entanglements associated with a U.S. passport.
Obviously you have no idea what you're talking about - or you're just a boot-licking retard. To be honest, I think it's a toss-up.

Bitcoin represents an existential threat to the fiat Ponzi scheme.
So let's say you're a bankster and want to drive the price down and get people to sell - make them sick of even the thought of Bitcoin, how do you do it?
The simple way is buy it on OTC using your unlimited supply of worthless fiat (unseen and no effect on price) and dump it on the exchanges (seen and big negative effect on price).
It's not complicated.

It was just a standard bankster attack against bitcoin designed to undermine confidence at a critical phase in price and to bail out their shorter friends at CME less than 24 hours before futures expired.

I'm surprised it took the Bolsheviks this long to finally take the mask off.
Their fiat Ponzi scam is under threat and this is how they respond. Look for lots of stories in the media (more than usual) linking bitcoin to drugs, terrorism, etc... to help support this pro-bankster legislation.
I will admit I'm surprised they didn't unveil this less than 24 hours before CME May futures expired.

Threatened? In other words asked you about it as a matter of form? Threatened?

Hilarious watching the Trotskyites trying to shut down social media platforms that compete with their billionaire friends while hiding behind the flag of 'diversity.'

Anybody who, after being educated on the matter, willfully leaves their coins on an exchange as some kind of bank account deserves anything that happens.
You will be used as a teaching tool and example for others so some use will come from your total loss.

"These bitcoin people or whatever they are, do they have a leader, some kind of identifiable spokesman that we could interview, get some quotes from?"
Yes, Andres Antonopolous, good public speaker and has testified before governmental committees. Author of several books on the subject and works with the Chicago Mercantile Exchange overseeing their bitcoin futures contracts.
"Interesting. But who's this Charlie Shrem guy that's the target of lawsuits and has connections to drugs and scams? You know what, we're going with Shrem, he's perfect."
Yes sir.

You're just a waste of time. Really, it's just the same old debunked nonsense we've all heard a million times.

It's interesting, isn't it? Seeing the hive mentality on display.
Dual-citizen Sherman, ostensibly representing the people of California, shows his first instinct is to protect the New York Fed and the fiat Ponzi.
I think we can chalk up another benefit of bitcoin: Mask removal.

This is pretty interesting for a couple of reasons because Coinbase is at the top of the CFPB's complaint list. The CU might be conflating Coinbase (the cancerous organization we all know it is) with all cryptocurrency usage.
But notice their vague direction in merely pointing you to the CFPB and NCUA web sites. No link to anything specific and a search of NCUA shows only a general article about bitcoin from 2015. CFPB issues no warning against bitcoin but does take to task Coinbase specifically for screwing people over.
Once again it looks like we can thank Coinbase for ruining things. What needs to happen here is some fresh direction and a clear statement from NCUA to its members regarding bitcoin. I'll make that call.
