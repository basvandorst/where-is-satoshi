most likely tomorrow even

speak for yourself ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

The price at the time of the transaction counts, not the price when the transaction goes through, I can't answer the rest of your question, sorry. I'm in the same boat, want to invest for the first time tomorrow and I'm worried about the fees.

We're nearing an all-time high, so I'd say most likely not. maybe wait a few days and see what happens

How much do you guys usually buy at once? I'm thinking of going in with my first 100 once it dips

Guthaben is the amount of money you currently have, not the profit 
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:47:35
you posted that like 4 times already my dude
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:45:18
I missed out on the dip a few days ago because my bank transaction was so slow over the weekend so yeah, I'm with you 
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:41:33
Are you waiting for a dip or do you just buy whenever? I missed out on the dip a few days ago because my bank transaction was too slow, now I'm not sure when to buy, it's been going up every day ever since 
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:14:52
that was the intention ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°) 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:17:24
It was 9100 for a short moment 
@_date: 2017-11-15 08:55:30
I'm in the same boat and now it's almost 7000, not sure if I should just buy now, or wait.
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:03:15
I'm in the same boat my dude, couldn't get my money over he weekend when it was 5500, got it when it was 6900. I didn't buy hoping for a dip, now we're almost at 8000, good stuff 
@_date: 2017-11-13 14:22:54
so If i have USD/€ on my bitcoin account, can I transfer it to DGAX and buy bitcoin for lower fees?
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:46:30
I'm in the same boat, i wanted to invest my first $ last week when it was at 5500, but my banl transaction was stuck over the weekend and  by the time i got the money it was at 7000, now I still haven't bought and I don't know what to do
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:33:06
wasn't that the initial goal?
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:25:03
I've been there over the weekend, it really is nerve-wracking, ended up getting the money too late to buy at the dip
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:49:27
I think this would apply more to USD values as there's way more people looking at those, but yes, there might be a psychological barrier
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:40:23
Thanks, you too, I just hope my money will arrive in the wallet before anything crazy happens and the price shoots up or something, felt really bad when it was at 5500 today and I couldn't buy.
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:07:49
Thanks, I appreciate it
