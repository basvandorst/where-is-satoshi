I don't think this point is relevant. The specific solution doesn't affect anything unless it allows something that isn't already possible with existing solutions.
Your example of an inflationary algorithm has nothing to do with the Byzantine general's problem and could easily use the existing solution with different values.


Bitcoin is not more popular or easier to use than dollar bills. Things become popular because they're already superior to alternatives, and easier to use because people build things to automate difficult or tedious actions.

That's called fractional reserve banking. It would work with bitcoins just like it works with gold, but you'd have to convince people to deposit their bitcoins for safe keeping. The bank would only have a fraction of total deposits in reserve, but as long as no more than that available fraction is withdrawn no one would notice.
Functionality aside it's fraudulent because the bank promises to give you your money at any time, but they can't keep that promise if everyone wants all their money back at the same time.
A CD isn't fundamentally fraudulent because the bank knows when their liabilities _can_ be reclaimed and can structure their loans so they mature before their liabilities. Customers who use CDs know that there is risk involved and that they can't withdraw their money until the date specified in the contract.

Paying people without the income to do so is impossible, so government charity would be cut and people would move to the more productive town where they can get jobs ("collapse"). The benefit is that the problem resolves itself (for better or worse) much more quickly than it does on a federal scale.
People are moving out of the US because of high taxes, it's just happening slower so the US has time to decline further and with less local relief than a single local community would be capable of.

Don't forget to take the inefficiencies of the state into account. All the people who distribute welfare checks want to take their cuts and give their buddies jobs.

Signing a transaction is required to ensure that you own the coins that you are trying to send. There is nothing to stop you from sending the same coins as many times as you want, but only one of those transactions will make it into the blockchain.

Assuming nodes transmit all transactions and miners include the transaction with the largest fee, you just send a transaction spending the same coins to your own address with a slightly higher miner fee before the next block is mined.
That won't work if a block including the original transaction has already been mined, and I'm not sure if reference nodes transmit duplicate transactions and include the largest regardless of order received. If they don't it should be sufficient, in many cases, to just listen for duplicate transactions from as many nodes as you can. The _attempt_ is trivial, but actually succeeding might not be.
Companies that accept zero confirmation transactions _should_ understand the risk associated with doing so, but I'm not sure how many actually do.

Wallets don't necessarily empty whole addresses, but they do empty transaction outputs. If all of the transactions at an address were needed it could empty the entire address.
For example, if someone sent you 1 bitcoin and then you tried to spend .4 bitcoins you would have to send the other .6 bitcoins in the transaction to yourself. If someone had previously sent less than .4 or more than 1 bitcoins to the same address you would, with most wallets, still be able to spend those.

Use the metric prefixes, and when "bit" becomes commonly (and relatively exclusively) associated with something we can start using it. If "milli/nanobitcoin" is too long use "millicoin" to refer to mɃ and "nanocoin" for μɃ (as far as I know that's currently unambiguous).

"Confirmation" is based on the number of blocks it takes an average amount of time to generate. Currently, 1 block is generally considered "sufficient" for small transactions.

That looks like the probability that the attacker would be able to *keep up* with the network. Actually pulling off the attack would require surpassing the network, since in the case of a tie miners will use whichever block they receive first. I guess just keeping up could reliably translate into a successful attack if the attacker is well connected.
51% of the network could still be used to reliably rewrite any number of blocks given a sufficient amount of time even if the network gets a head start, potentially even double spending transactions they sent well before they got 51 percent. I agree that it would be nearly impossible to pull off using a pool, and it may even be possible to detect a traditional attack heuristically.

It isn't necessary (and may not even be possible, depending on the number and type of transactions) to empty an entire address in a single transaction, and I doubt any widely used wallet tries to. If nothing else it would increase the transaction fee.
Transactions have a list of inputs, a list of outputs, and some other stuff. The list of inputs consists of the hash of the input and the index of the output (from the input transaction) to use. Each output can only be referenced once in the blockchain, so if the sum of the transaction’s inputs is greater than it's outputs, the difference is lost forever.
Since the input may not equal the output, it is essential to send "change" somewhere. It could easily be returned to one of the addresses you are sending from, but most wallets return it to a background address to make it more difficult to figure out how much and to which address you are sending bitcoins.
It is possible to make a transaction with multiple outputs to a single address. Only one output can be used for each entry in the input list, but the same transaction can be listed more than once.

Something that distributes the storage burden itself might work well.

1. True for wallets, but the network itself is very secure. That's an important distinction.
2. There are somewhat effective ways to tax bitcoins, and there are types of taxes that don't even require tracking transactions, such as the land value tax and property tax.
3. Services will be built, currencies can be pegged to the value of bitcoin, etc. I think it will eventually be at least as easy as using a credit card.

The protocol keeps track of balances as integers. There are no decimal places until the client displays the balance. If the software just multiplies everything it can still tell us that we have 1.0 bitcoin, and if the storage format is extended it can still just tell us we have 1.0 bitcoin (or 100000000 satoshi). Everything will be functionally identical for most things whether we add another integer or just shift the value of transactions in the same integer. The only exception is reading and creating transactions. I think adding an integer to transactions would be easier to implement correctly and less controversial than "multiplying" the balance. :)

Long term fluctuations in price. Either your currency is going to fluctuate, the backing is going to fluctuate, or the value of the currencies it's pegged to will fluctuate.
I'm going to use the # symbol for your currency and assume it's pegged to dollars for simplicity, and values are round for easy math.
If the average value of bitcoins during your initial distribution is $1000 and you distribute a total of  you end up with Ƀ1 and  in circulation. If the value of bitcoins then decreases to $900 and  is traded back for bitcoins (Ƀ0.01111111) you now have Ƀ0.98888888 backing and  in circulation.
If the value of bitcoins then increases to $1000 again and that  is bought back (for 0.01 bitcoins) you now have  in circulation backed by Ƀ0.99888888 (which is worth $998.88). As the cycle repeats the number of bitcoins your currency has decreases.
Catching the initial increase in value of bitcoins only prolongs the inevitable death of your reserve once the value does stabilize or start to decline.
Basically your currency will end up "buying high and selling low."

Selling at a discount for bitcoin looks like a way for people to get rich at the expense of your currency. In the simplest case, I buy one unit for 0.99 unit worth of bitcoins, immediately sell back for a full unit worth of bitcoins, and repeat until there are no bitcoins left.
If you sell for the full units worh of bitcoin, unless you want to back your currency with bitcoin itself, people will arbitrage based on bitcoins own volatility (buy 1 unit with 1 bitcoin, bitcoin value decreases, sell 1 unit for 1.1 bitcoin).

1. It is possible to require multiple people or institutions to sign a transaction. Risk of bank failure can be mitigated at the expense of convenience and vice versa.
2. Try escaping taxes on a piece of property you own.
3. It will still be possible to transfer large amounts of value across borders with little cost. Increasing ease of use doesn't require compromising the existing properties of the entire system.
4. I didn't say the whole thing was quantum resistant, just that some parts of it happen to be. The blockchain itself, as a concept, can be implemented with different technologies. When those technologies are broken they can be replaced. Even if those changes are incompatible with old software the existing bitcoins will not change hands.

There are 10 numbers in the range [0,9]. There are 90 numbers in the range [10,99]. By your logic restricting yourself to [0,9] is more secure than using a random value in [0,99] because the latter has a 90% chance of producing 2 digit numbers and therefore RNGs are more likely to generate 2 digit numbers.

Assuming the average block contains Ƀ0.01 and 50% of that is "low" fees the miners that are colluding will be throwing away Ƀ0.005 per block which is then available to anyone who wants to accept low fees. If they were spending Ƀ0.0099999 in electricity per block they are now losing Ƀ0.0049999 per block and a little less than half of their hashing power will be shut down to compensate. As a result the difficulty will decrease, making it even easier for people who do accept the other Ƀ0.005 per block (which accumulates over time) to make a profit.
People like profit, so they'll start buying equipment, joining pools, or whatever they can do to make that profit. The more people mining the low fee coins the higher the difficulty goes, making it more difficult for the price fixers to make a profit and causing them to shut down more of their mining equipment to avoid losing money.

Paying a defence agency to defend your individual property from an army would get quite expensive. If everyone in your community helped (either by hiring their own agency or helping fund one common agency) the price per person would decrease, but any one individual would get the benefits of the defence whether or not they paid for it.
If people do take advantage of the defence you're paying for (which _will_ happen eventually) and you don't want to disproportionately fund the defence of your community you'd need to have some way of enforcing payment, and you'd end up with a government.

As the price of bitcoin rises (and starts to fall) people lose confidence in its continued ability to rise in the short term, so they'll seek alternatives. When the value falls (and starts to rise) they gain confidence in bitcoin's short term ability to rise and will therefore demand more bitcoins at the expense of whatever they're holding.
For example, bitcoins are $950 right now on mtgox. I'm waiting for the prices to fall before I buy, and if I wasn't concerned about taxes I might sell a little to buy back once the price falls. Plenty of other people who aren't as concerned about taxes are selling. When the price hit $570 everyone was buying.

I think it's a fair assumption to assume that WalMart is a relatively cheap place to shop. If they raised their wages they would have to raise their prices.

If WalMart manages to stay in business because everyone raised prices what have we gained? The employees still need to buy stuff, and the stuff that they used to buy is now more expensive. Because their cost of living is higher it's very likely that we'll still be giving them food stamps and MediCaid.

But with less than 50% of the network it is incredibly unlikely for them to create a chain long enough to double-spend large amounts of bitcoin because the person receiving the transaction will wait for more than just one or two confirmations.

Two party escrow with mutually assured destruction is particularly interesting.
Basically, the buyer commits twice the price of the item and the seller commits the price of the item*. If both are happy with the transaction the seller is refunded what they committed plus the payment for the item and the buyer is refunded the price of the item. Otherwise the coins are destroyed by sending them to an address with no public key or with a zero output transaction (giving all funds to miner fees) at some point in the future.
There's a graphic for a similar system [here]( that might help explain it better. The system I described assumes the payment is in bitcoin and completes the payment as part of the resolution, but wouldn't work for exchanging two non-bitcoin type goods.
[NASHX]( doesn't send destroyed coins to miners because they don't want to give them means to game the system, but by restricting the final destruction of funds to a later date both parties have plenty of time to broadcast the destruction transaction before either can mine a block containing it. As long as the scammer doesn't control 30% of the network they will be unable to recoup their funds reliably.
I think this type of system can probably be implemented directly using transaction scripts, with a third party optionally only coordinating the sale of the item and signing of transactions.

Coins are spent from transactions, not addresses. The private key is required to *sign* the output of the old transaction for the new transaction. Each output of each transaction is associated with an address that can use that output for new transactions.
If balances were address based and you sent someone a transaction that didn't confirm for some reason (maybe your client is using a future version of the protocol because your computer's clock is out of sync) and then you fix the problem and re-send the transaction, the old transaction could be processed in the future taking any new coins that get sent to your address.

According to  WalMart employs 2 million people. Full time is apparently 34 hours a week, so assuming an average of 17 hours per week (approximately 3.4 hours per day with a 5 day workweek) to account for part time workers, using the CEO's _entire_ salary to pay employees would result in a 74¢ per hour increase per employee, or an extra $655.92 per year per employee.

If they are at 49% of the network, the rest of the network is - by definition - 51% of the network and can barely outpace them.
To perform a double spend attack, you must first spend your coins and then present a longer blockchain that contains a transaction spending those same coins to a different address.
Let's say the network can produce one block every ten minutes. If someone controls 51% of the network, they can produce about one block every 19 minutes and 36 seconds while the "legit" network can produce a block every 20 minutes and 24 seconds (48 second gap).
It would take the 51% entity 3 hours and 15 minutes to generate 10 blocks while it would take the rest of the network 3 hours and 24 minutes. At 10 blocks deep, the 51% chain is one block longer for an average of nine whole minutes, and the gap only gets longer as long as the entity maintains 51% of the hashing power and continues the attack.
DISCLAIMER: My math may not be 100% correct, but the basic idea still stands.
