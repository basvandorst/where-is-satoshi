The lowest I think we'll go is MAYBE 4900, but we could very well begin a new uptrend before it gets down there.

What are the inaccuracies? 
The main takeaways are..
1) Federal reserve works in conjunction with the government, but is privately owned and not actually a part of it. 
2) The owners of it are hidden from public record (though there are some obvious suspects). 
3) These individuals are not elected, nor accountable to us, yet yield a great deal of power and influence. 
4) The value of our money is backed only government decree and the threat of force as it pertains to the oil trade. 
5) Nixon removed the peg to gold in the 70's. 
6) Fiat currencies eventually see their true value, which is the value of the paper they use to print it... which is happening in Venezuela
7) The ability for those in power to borrow prosperity from future generations by running up debt via the creation of a limitless supply of money enables these never-ending wars to be funded.
8) These wars are based on lies, and among the true reasons for them is to defend the petrodollar. 
9) People shouldn't freak out and sell their crypto when a high profile banker says he doesn't like it. 
10) Bitcoin provides a solution to this.
Can you elaborate a bit more on what's inaccurate?

Just dollar cost average in and you'll end up being happy you did once the market turns around.

Bitcoin provides an alternative. A way out of this debt-based financial system.

What specifically is untrue? 
Do you have faith in the current financial system?
Do you disagree that there's a lot of secrecy around the ownership of the FED?
Do you believe the official narrative you were told to justify the invasions in the middle east? 
Example: 9/11, "weapons of mass destruction" etc?
To simply label those who present information which counters the mainstream narrative  as "conspiracy nuts" isn't really bringing fourth a constructive argument. 
I'd be interested in learning more about your point of view. Can you elaborate a bit more?

Love seeing this. It'll introduce a lot of people to Bitcoin likely haven't have heard of it. 
I saw one of these in the mall by my place the other day but it was charging a massive premium.
