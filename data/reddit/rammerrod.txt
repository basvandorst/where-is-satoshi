You are the worst time traveler ever. You picked now??!! All of time and you picked now? Now?! It's time to go back to the future. Edit: /s I'm new here and I'm old.
@_date: 2019-07-12 22:52:42
Completely agree.
@_date: 2019-07-26 13:09:57
Mine should be the standard. Somebody call the weights and measures division!

Yeah, I guess if I was Trump I would tweet about bitcoin being "bad" too. This guy (the author of the article) is a a bunch of words society taught me not to say.

Are you really Iranian? If you are, are you allowed to discuss your opinion of your government without persecution?
@_date: 2019-07-13 00:54:34
Thanks for digging deeper. I was at work and couldn't.
@_date: 2019-07-17 22:43:35
I should have put  /s. My apologies.
@_date: 2019-07-23 05:11:28
Be cool if it was me though....getting richer. Cause me. You think it too, it's ok. But yeah, some real rich assholes that screw over A LOT of people pretty much run things....and unless you have a bunch of money....you aren't going to do a damn thing about it. 
Edit: In general, not just bitcoin.

My mother is Welsh. My father is Hungarian. Guess you could call me...well hung.

I trade perfectly. Buy low. Sell high. I'm a multithousandaire.  Actual trader. I cheat though. I have a guy.

But you can make lemons!! Cross a citron with an orange, boom...lemons.
@_date: 2018-08-11 11:11:17
Did I mention I have a guy? He does the things.  
@_date: 2018-08-11 05:58:06
I always buy at exactly the bottom, and then I sell at exactly the peak.....every...got...dang...time. They call me "Hindsight", but you can call me..."Big Poppa". B-I-G  P-O-P-P-A...NO INFO FOR THE...DEA. Federal agents mad cause I'm flagrant....sorry...fucking Brooklyn.

Too much.

Beats my savings account consistently.

That is not your opinion......priceless.

I'd switch banks if any of my banks pulled this shit.

Bought at 20k eh?

13 million individuals?

@_date: 2019-08-05 21:50:56
Definitely plays a role in the....how did you put it? Ah yes, shitshow.
@_date: 2019-10-27 04:58:48
I was gonna say that, lol.
@_date: 2019-08-18 21:08:55
Yes. That WAS China's plan, and it worked.
@_date: 2019-08-19 16:54:38
It was one of their emperors ideas as the industrial revolution was happening. Look it up. Create a large population to make stuff for the world. Guy was a genius.
@_date: 2019-10-08 12:36:18
The only way that I know of, but how would that play out? The whole world is dependent on the internet now.
@_date: 2019-08-18 20:32:55
Idk, this feels different.

I think he means in respect to dollars. In which case he is correct. Because negative numbers.
@_date: 2019-06-20 21:38:42
A billion used to be a milliard and a billion used to be a million million instead of one thousand million.
@_date: 2019-06-09 12:32:02
Isn't it well known they don't have the money to back it and it's abused by the exchange?
@_date: 2019-06-09 12:30:03
Salad isn't a disgraceful imposter. Tether is.
@_date: 2019-10-27 15:13:31
But what time is it?

Cars are horrible investments, but I like to go fast luxuriously. The only way I know that you can do that is to spend a bunch of money.
@_date: 2019-06-20 03:50:04
Here's the thing...google what a billion really is. They changed the naming scheme way back. I read something about it 20 years ago. It's a rabbit hole if you're truly interested.
@_date: 2019-06-09 13:32:45
Is this a real life number? 354.903,52
@_date: 2019-06-18 23:15:05
Here are some more things he said.
@_date: 2019-02-22 03:20:36
Have an upvote. You deserve it.
@_date: 2019-06-09 03:52:36
I want tether to disappear. Too shady for me.
@_date: 2019-02-22 03:22:00
Yeah, quite ballsy what he's been blathering about. 
@_date: 2019-06-09 17:32:14
Hey, that makes sense. No wonder Americans don't do it.
@_date: 2019-12-09 02:53:16
What do you mean by this? Is Coinbase more lenient on login security in certain countries? I would think that would be a universal thing. How wrong am I?

I just bought an alt coin. What should i do now?
@_date: 2019-04-03 04:14:29
Just read this. Realized I installed it awhile back to send a friend some cash a couple of thousand miles away. Still had 5 dollars from the invite promo....now have btc kinda.
@_date: 2019-04-03 03:52:55
What about XLM and the IBM World Wire situation?
@_date: 2019-04-19 19:32:39
Is that a bird's nest?
@_date: 2019-04-03 02:44:04
I only buy the best altcoins.
There are a plethora of use cases. Certain block chains will provide catered benefits to certain industries and financial sectors. There will be more than a few winners. Most will inevitably fail.

Did you even read the tea leaves?
@_date: 2019-04-14 22:38:31
Sure there was uncertainty. Could have climbed to 50k and found bottom at 20k. If it was so obvious that it was going to crash, this person would have sold. Good old greed had hodl.
@_date: 2019-04-14 21:30:27
Well, that is very unfortunate. Should have sold it all. Of course if you would have BTC could have never dipped again and you'd be forced to settle for the profits you booked and would essentially be out of the game. Dang uncertainty.
@_date: 2018-11-27 05:47:44
What is a reddit coin?
@_date: 2019-01-08 05:10:12
3200 in 2 days.....please.
@_date: 2019-01-03 07:53:40
No way!?
@_date: 2019-01-03 07:52:47
Yeah right.
@_date: 2018-07-13 03:47:53
Is this not the bitcoin sub? You're worried about debt being paid back when the entire global economy is about to undergo a revolution? So how does switching to bitcoin solve this problem????
@_date: 2019-09-24 20:03:58
Me too. Too bad i wasted that capital on gold while I was waiting....fml.
@_date: 2019-09-19 12:54:10
Wishful thinking.
@_date: 2019-09-24 20:01:49
It's a Trump Dump....act as if nothing happened, because it didn't.
@_date: 2018-04-14 21:51:02
Paid $4.99 for mine... $
@_date: 2019-05-21 23:20:42
Great idea! You'll see them soon.
