Hello IcIc_,
We have built HeliosCard with as many anti-malware features as possible, but ultimately these are all best-effort solutions and trust in the phone is still required.
1) When the HeliosCard smartphone app first connects to the HeliosCard, a secure pairing key is generated which the app stores in secure private storage, and uses to authenticate later connections to the card.  In order to switch phones/apps, a number from the back of the card must be re-entered.
2) When the HeliosCard application is in the foreground, it locks other applications out from using the NFC radio.
3) Given the relatively few apps that use NFC, as a user, you can be especially scrutinizing of installing applications that use NFC permissions (or even not install such apps altogether), thus preventing giving other apps permissions to use the NFC radio and potentially talk to the HeliosCard.
These are all best efforts, and trust in the phone will ultimately be needed.
However, we believe benefits of HeliosCard, including...
1) payment-industry standard physical resistance to attack
2) the wonderful user experience of simply tapping your HeliosCard to your phone and have your phone instantly becoming your new wallet
3) its relatively low price point at $20-$30 USD
4) Its extreme portability, requiring no battery and charging as a result of its having no display
...give HeliosCard truly compelling use cases as a cold storage or even day-to-day use.  A user might use multiple HeliosCards to use as cold storage and at its current price point, that would be a great way to use it.  Given that a user does not touch their cold storage solutions that often, putting a keyboard/display on such a device would increase the cost and make it less compelling.
We are also investigating the possibility of offering a stripped down, low-cost Android device for those users who are worried about malware. The user would use this low-cost phone only for talking to their HeliosCard, and not install other software on it.

Hi Gidze,
The underlying chip is a microprocessor from NXP in the P5CD family.  The chip natively supports hardware accelerated elliptical curve key generation and signing.

The encrypted keys cannot be cloned from the card; this is one of the primary purposes of smartcard chip technology.  HeliosCard has a full microprocessor that performs tasks asked of it, and there is simply no command for "return all data".  HeliosCard will allow you to back up keys until you specifically declare that you would like to lock the keys, at which point they are no longer exportable.
In order to get at the raw encrypted data stored by HeliosCard, one would have to physically attack the card, which by design is resistant to such attacks (it is Common Criteria EAL5 rated).  That's not to say it's not impossible to physically get at the memory on the card, but it is extremely difficult, time consuming, error prone, and typically requires expensive equipment.

Hello J2383,
HeliosCard has a minimum data retention time of 25 years.  In addition, when you initially create your keys, you are given the ability to back your keys up on to another HeliosCard or to a password encrypted file, after which you can lock the key from being exportable.  Finally, we believe the ease of use is unparalleled compared to a paper wallet.  When you tap HeliosCard to a phone, the phone immediately synchronizes your public keys and uses information on the card to speed the blockchain synchronization process.  You're ready to go literally moments after you tap.  We believe it's a wonderful experience for people who are cold storing their keys.  We invite you to watch the video!

Thanks hi-i!  The name "HeliosCard" came from a combination of a few factors:
1) Helios is the name of the recently released album by the Fray, of which one of our teammember is a fan.
2) The slightly less romantic reason that the .com domain was available.

Hi MillyBitcoin,
A single HeliosCard can hold up to 5 addresses simultaneously.  The wallet app fully supports showing you your balance and transactions from all addresses.  When it comes time to do a transaction, the wallet will put together unspent money from any of your keys until it's found enough to fill the transaction, and HeliosCard can sign the transaction against multiple keys as needed.  It is not deterministic, but it is something we plan on investigating in future.
