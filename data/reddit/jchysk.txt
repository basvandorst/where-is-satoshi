Bitcoin services are actually moving towards providing adequate security and having standards of openness and protection so that people can safely store their coins in online wallets. 
This helps push the security standards higher.

Bitcoin-qt is probably the most confusing though. If you list out all the unspents, it lists individual addresses associated with a balance. Your entire wallet may have 10 coins made up of dozens of unspents, but if you construct a transaction from a single one of these unspents you're still specifying it by referencing a Bitcoin address.
This just made me think of another potential way to lose money from improper change management with Bitcoind. What if you construct a transaction (to, amount, change) and then receive coins at one of the unspents before sending out the transaction to the network? You would just be sending that remainder out as fees since the change and amount are specified and the fee is calculated by deduction.
@_date: 2014-06-06 17:10:50
It's listed pretty plainly... It seems you somehow managed to figure it out.
@_date: 2014-04-28 16:51:35
You should check out LaunchKey.

The amount changes on Chrome, but not on Firefox. The Approved Amount and Bitcoin market place remain empty on both browsers.

OKCoin is also the one that fakes their volume, right?
Their BTC/CNY currency pair looks like it only has 38k BTC 24 hour volume. So I'm assuming that majority of their volume is LTC/BTC.
HuoBi still has gigantic volume 100k+ BTC 24 hour for BTC/CNY. They have 0% fees though so there's a lot smaller edges being pushed.

Still no official statement from the IRS and that response itself basically says that it hasn't been labeled yet. You can treat it like income right now, but it may be subject to capital gains later on if classified as a commodity.
@_date: 2014-01-10 03:42:59
There's a lot of confusion around this. Coinsetter isn't an exchange, it's closer to a derivatives platform. Right now with the tax code Bitcoin is most likely treated a commodity that you should be paying capital gains taxes on. If you can trade it for profits, but never actually hold the currency itself, just the derivative then you can get away with paying significantly less in taxes.
So if you create an account and buy Bitcoin on the site with USD, that trade is still being executed and real Bitcoins were purchased with USD, but you have to liquidate the position back into USD in order to claim the profits. Same goes true for vice versa. When features like margin become available then it really won't matter what the base currency is that is used since you can short or go long. 
Even if it's not set up this way now, I'd imagine individuals could have two internal accounts or "wallets" for having base USD and base Bitcoin, but not allowing the money to be intertwined in any way.
@_date: 2014-07-01 21:38:04
There are dozens of services/protocols that already allow for this. Check out launchkey
@_date: 2014-02-28 19:57:53
Blockchain needs to add LaunchKey as a multi-factor option.
@_date: 2014-03-13 23:22:26
Even the vault is a risk though from the way they explain how it works. You send your Bitcoins to the vault and **then** they take the computer offline to go hide it in the mountains. Why is it ever online in the first place?
@_date: 2014-03-14 13:00:57


One 2 factor auth? It's all about the factors: what category they fall into, how many categories you cover, and how secure each one is. A PIN (incredibly weak knowledge factor) and TOTP (ok possession factor) versus almost any set of 2 factors is going to be weaker. With LaunchKey the PIN could be replaced with just the possession factor and your convenience is about the same but magnitudes stronger security. You can add on some other passive factors without decreasing convenience to be 2-factor every time. You could add a knowledge factor to be multi-factor and more secure than PIN + pw + TOTP.
The other added benefit is not having the layer of authentication on the web and brought to your personal device instead. If the insurance really is only paid out when Xapo screws up and not if the individual user is hacked, it's more helpful against fraud and malicious attacks if hackers can't even attempt to access an account without first stealing your device.
@_date: 2014-03-13 22:11:07
From looking at their security, they're really going to need that insurance. Default login is seriously 4 digit PIN? Everything from their HTTP headers to SSL Ciphers is meh. I'd hate to dig in and see what a real penetration test shows.
@_date: 2014-06-05 20:54:55
No, has to be purchased within 3 days.
@_date: 2014-07-01 21:37:03
You may want to look at LaunchKey then. It functions very similar to this where there are no passwords, but it's multi-factor and your identity is different to every place you authenticate.
@_date: 2014-01-10 06:56:27
The IRS has not said anything about Bitcoin except that they plan on providing guidance. It has not been officially stated whether it should be treated as income or capital gains although there's strong ground to support it'll more likely be considered capital gains.
@_date: 2014-01-15 20:04:36
Don't stop at 2-factor. Go multi-factor. It doesn't have to be extra inconvenience either.
@_date: 2014-01-10 03:44:21
Many people don't care so much about actually exchanging bitcoin as they do trading it (speculators).
@_date: 2014-03-18 00:44:29
Every unspent that is used in the transaction is zeroed out. Perhaps it needs to be clarified a bit more in this write-up, but it's not inaccurate.
@_date: 2014-03-14 05:47:57
Well as far as authentication is concerned, just using LaunchKey with a knowledge factor enabled would be more secure than that "3Factor". The 4-digit PIN part probably shouldn't be there at all. It opens more opportunities to allow stupidity or negligence to happen.

On the request gift card exchange page, after you click "Request Exchange" what happens? How do you know what amount you're getting or if your request will succeed?
@_date: 2014-03-13 23:40:45
Exactly. They should have their Vault be true cold storage. There's no reason for it not to be.

Coinsetter is located in New York. They have an entity in Canada that is better to do business out of. It's kind of like how every tech company is incorporated in Delaware whereas very few of them are actually located there.
@_date: 2014-03-14 05:37:50
Not sure where you found that. Conflicting or unclear information. Here's from page two on their Vault explanation:






@_date: 2014-03-18 03:26:48
Sorry, I'm mixing up bitcoind which comes with bitcoin-qt. What I'm saying though is that you list unspents and you get a list of addresses and associated quantities of coins. You can send to any one of those addresses, and the number of coins will go up by that amount. If you wish to send coins somewhere else you can build a transaction and specify the address(es) that you would like to spend from. After submitting the transaction those addresses will have 0 balances associated with them unless you reused one as a change address.
So, that is confusing. Any one of those addresses with a listed balance can be made up of one or many transactions, but the way it's presented doesn't make it easy to infer how things are actually working until you dig deeper into the code.
@_date: 2015-01-21 03:12:11
A bunch of us now-Bitcoiners worked on this about 4-5 years back. There was a working prototype. It was what got us into Bitcoin.

Just did a purchase, took 12 minutes before I could cash out. The coins didn't appear in my account though until they were available to cash out which can be a little disconcerting after receiving the message about how they're ready to use *immediately*. Still really fast though.
@_date: 2013-11-19 19:06:06
It's not an actual exchange, but a derivatives platform.  If you deposit with bitcoin, you eventually liquidate and cash out with bitcoin. If you deposit with USD you'll eventually liquidate with USD.
@_date: 2013-07-20 04:26:49
Gah! Good question. It was 27 minutes after that. So 39 minutes total from purchase to actually initiating a withdrawal on the network.

You don't want to 1-way encrypt it. You want to 1-way hash it.

There seems to be answers to the first two of those questions and the last one.
OpenID was supposed to be the solution to all these problems and it fragmented off into every major site trying to be its own provider and being too difficult for the average person to be able to manage their own identity. Persona is a little bit better. This is better in making it out-of-band, but besides that I don't see what would make this succeed.
This SQRL solution still has some useability issues. Once all set up and on sites that support it you might be good to go, but chicken-egg problem... Do you need to type in your password each time you want to authenticate? That's a major hassle. If you don't, then your master key is just left unencrypted in memory. Also, it seems people mostly just hate QR codes.
I disagree on the bit on how trivial it is to get the password from the mobile device. Malware on Androids is pretty rampant and you'd be impressed at how much someone can get off an iphone once they jailbreak it.
I think a lot of the issues that arise are going to be in real-life use cases. Sites have to implement support for this solution which requires adoption that won't come easily. XSS attacks trying to trick people to login to different places. People will lose their phones and not have backups (google "lost bitcoin wallet" for reference).
When the most interesting questions have something other than &lt;to be written&gt; for the answers it might be worth another look.

I do agree that companies feel far more comfortable using something backed by a company where they can subscribe to support packages and have someone to blame when things go wrong. OpenCoin, Inc. obv has some big names behind them with the right connections to the financial services industry. The main problem I had all along was how disingenious they're being about XRP and how open Ripple is.
It makes me want to root for OT. It also makes me think OpenCoin, Inc. has a good chance of crashing and burning.
@_date: 2013-12-04 22:47:22
You should receive an authentication request on your device. When you swipe to approve, then you'll be logged in. Then you can enter your bitcoin address to be queued for payment.

Well the benefit of a place like Coinsetter for those in the US is it's a US company based in NYC that is complying with US regulations and has a US compliant bank account. 
Use of many of the existing exchanges may be considered legally gray, or worse, difficult to fight anything if you're screwed over. If you're outside of the US, the importance probably lies more in liquidity and platform stability which obviously a new exchange has yet to prove (but yet to disprove as well).
@_date: 2013-10-14 03:17:44
It's similar to Bitcoin in the fact that if you lose the master key or wallet you're in completely screwed.
SQRL is interesting, but it has a LOT of issues and the current spec has too many inherent flaws to be used seriously.

There are already altcoins that have improvements over Bitcoin like a better hashing algorithm. These are pretty short-sighted upgrades whereas Bitcoin was revolutionary in comparison to what came before it. If there were a far more advanced crypto-currency (and there will be) that solves a lot of the issues and is made to be more future-proof then it could gain adoption much like how Bitcoin has. I imagine resistance to change will remain an issue, but enough understanding and support eventually changes the tide.
A system could be designed where bitcoins could actually be traded into a new currency where the bitcoins are eliminated within the system and a person would be issued a proper amount of the new currency.

If that day ever comes. Alternatives that are already open sourced may spring ahead before that has a chance to happen.
