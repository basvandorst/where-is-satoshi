I satoshi this

The same thing could happen with a pure-bred. There's no guarantee with living creatures. That's actually the whole point of life, to be honest.

Have you tried "First World Problems"?
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:58:13
If you consider dogs "things", I guess that's your prerogative.
@_date: 2018-05-17 03:13:29


What do you mean? Like, for the principal of your school or...?
@_date: 2018-05-17 03:15:52
Yep, another slice of relevant trivia is that there are people living there currently and they had to ask people to stop throwing pizzas on their roof.

Why would someone downvote my question instead of answering it? Fucking moron
@_date: 2015-01-14 13:53:26
Is this small crash directly related to the scam altcoins?
@_date: 2017-01-05 14:07:43
How much does one of those go for on the market as of now?
@_date: 2017-08-17 20:50:50
Same thing happened to me and a salad.

Phishing dyslexics.
@_date: 2019-06-22 07:04:34
Totally. Besides the joke, it's a beautiful shot. I always forget to search for a longer version.

I've been using virwox because buying BTC here in Argentina is a pain in the ass and it's pretty expensive anyway, and everytime I used virwox, every exchange was almost instant (Paypal -&gt; Virwox, USD-&gt;SLL , SLL -&gt; BTC). In my case, the fees were worth it. It's less of a hit when the purchase is bigger, of course, but I don't have that much money to invest, unfortunately (fucking sucks to be in a third world country, if you don't mind my venting).

Hi, quick question: couldn't that be exactly what every big stakeholder is planning to do (I'm talking both sides: miners, startups, devs, noders) and suddenly attempt to double their capital at the expense of the future of BTC? I might be talking nonsense by now, I've been reading about the fork for hours now). Thanks, sorry
@_date: 2017-11-08 12:52:58
...and their food on their plates.  
  
  
  
  I'm sorry.
@_date: 2017-11-07 19:54:41
Exactly my feeling, they seem to be vague on purpose.
@_date: 2017-11-08 12:57:07
I'm 5 and what is this?
@_date: 2017-11-07 12:18:12
Thanks, I had read that, but I don't fully understand: "If the minority chain has significant value, we will make that value available for customers to hold or exchange for a period of time, as we have done with Bitcoin Cash."
Does that mean I'll have the same amount in both chains, but the minority chain will have an "expiration date", or does that mean that they'll stipulate a deadline in which they will compare the accumulated difficulties of the chains and then terminate the amount of the minority chain in my account? I'm sorry, I've been reading about this stuff for a couple of hours now, and I haven't gone to bed yet and now it's 9 am and I'm in a haze. Thanks so much

Thanks :)

I'd also like to know what blockchain.info will be doing.

Woah that's the ultimate Popemobile.
@_date: 2018-03-02 05:12:28
Simple but brilliant.
@_date: 2017-09-29 20:28:22
Do you mean bitcoins don't actually eat ice cream?
@_date: 2017-09-15 16:16:47
I love you all.
@_date: 2017-09-15 17:10:10
How does a racist Chinese sound?
@_date: 2017-09-15 16:16:47
I love you all.
@_date: 2017-09-15 17:47:22
You hodl the wrong thing.
@_date: 2017-09-15 16:05:37
@_date: 2017-10-13 14:19:50
That doesn't answer my question.
@_date: 2017-10-13 18:16:47
What I'm saying is, if some shady character earned a lot of BTC a couple of years ago through some shady activity, he is rich now.
@_date: 2017-10-13 14:33:24
What I meant was that if some international criminals have been dealing with BTC for a while (since the time when BTC was worth a lot less), does it mean that now their capital has increased massively?
@_date: 2017-09-15 17:10:10
How does a racist Chinese sound?
@_date: 2017-10-13 14:22:02
So it is possible to track an old transaction and connect it with the people involved in it?
@_date: 2017-09-15 16:05:37
@_date: 2018-03-28 12:17:14
I loved it, but if would be funnier if he used a pickaxe.
@_date: 2017-10-13 14:43:22
Please don't answer by pointing the finger at banks, it makes this sound as a religious debate (or a political debate by fanatics, which is a kind of religious debate in itself) and I'm tired of those.
@_date: 2017-10-13 14:53:27
But that's very simplistic. Everything can be more dangerous if unquestioned, just because we as humans tapped a very high level of perversion, does it mean we should just stop caring about everyday life? Your answer is philosophical, I was trying to be a bit more pragmatic than that with my question.
@_date: 2017-10-13 18:10:58
I'm not worried, I'm just raising a question, I thought it could be an interesting debate.
@_date: 2017-10-13 14:58:09
I understand, thanks. I think I overestimated the use of BTC for illegal international transactions.
@_date: 2017-10-13 15:08:37
You're right, comparatively, it doesn't make any difference.
@_date: 2017-10-13 14:59:32
Or you could get BTC in exchange of illegal goods or services. But, as it was pointed out on another comment, this is still proportionally insignificant.
@_date: 2017-10-13 14:31:17
Interesting, thanks!
@_date: 2017-10-13 14:44:53
I don't mean buying or selling BTC, but using BTC as currency by itself.
@_date: 2017-10-13 14:37:27
Actually, you're right haha. Simplified: "Q:More danger? A: Can't."
@_date: 2018-04-27 14:59:22
That is the most confusing motto ever and yet it fits the Polystation perfectly I think.
@_date: 2018-04-03 16:27:50
I guess that's the reason for all the downvotes. It's was a joke. Some people might get it, some won't.
@_date: 2018-04-03 16:23:49
I love Laura Dern just as much as I hate Holdo, but that name was begging for a bitcoin pun.
@_date: 2018-04-03 18:07:33
The name change was the only reason why I searched for an inspirational quote from this character :P
@_date: 2017-06-29 16:49:09
That's what she said.
