Well this guy will probably have an accidental death soon.

Just wait for it on bitmain or buy on eBay with buyer protection. Don’t chance it with a sketchy site. Also don’t pm the dude above, could be a scam.

Profit taking is always safe. All my friends were happy when they sold everything at $3700 and $6000. Now they are in unbelief and regret. With crypto never cash all out.  I might take at most half out but all sounds like a bad idea. You will most likely miss the next leg up. Sell right after a peak not after consolidation.

Ah and there we go 18-19 level.

Hodl. Wouldn’t be dips without FUD.

If you look at bitcoins price trend over the last year it usually shoots up, dips, goes back to normal and then the next leg up. I think we are at the “normal price” now maybe a little on the high side. I’m expecting the next leg up soon to $18-19k.

Thanks for the link. This is really great to hear.

See we are so use to the idea of inflation. We say hey no big deal that my $1 bill will only be worth $0.97 cents next year. It’s the governments way of hidden taxation. I would rather have a cash that holds its value or even increases in value over time. True it does imitate gold more so than cash right now, but the old “cash” use to be gold. I think cryptocurrency will open peoples eyes to the scam of the federal reserve and the unlimited printing press. What happened to our dollar being backed by gold?

Old people, am I right?

Sorry to hear. Unfortunately there are a lot of bad people in this world. Hope you get some resolution from this or at least make it back by investing in bitcoin once again. Be safe and as everyone here is saying, use a hardware wallet or paper wallet.

He has said in the past that he doesn’t understand tech. The only reason he bought Apple was because someone in his company convinced him.

Congrats! Continue to hodl. Don’t let the media or banks change your mind.

Also funny to see everyone flip flop everyday.

Fair enough, it’s very possible it could bounce around in this range for a while.

Just looked, quite a wall to get through. Our Korean and Japanese friends thankfully don’t have the USD psychological barrier so they might punch it through.

Bitcoin will be the Bigbang show on Thursday so that could bring new money.
