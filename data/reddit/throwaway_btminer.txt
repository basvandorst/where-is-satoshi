I'm not the most knowledgeable person about it, but the way I understand that it works is that when you send a payment you are sending the solved hash containing the transaction information to other clients, those clients verify that you have the funds available to make the transaction. When there have been enough confirmations the transaction goes live.
btcguild is working with another pool plus the non-pooled machines; they make every single machine confirm every single transaction for the brief window that they send a payment that doesn't really have enough funds. Because they control a majority of the network the payment is seen as valid and sent across, even though the funds to do so didn't really exist.
Again, I haven't worked directly on this so it's likely a bit different than that, but this is my understanding of the matter. My role with btcguild was non-technical but fundamental to the business.

Why would I want to damage the reputation of a company that I had worked for unless I felt that they were doing something I know not to be right?

Indirectly involved. The distance is far enough that Mike wont know who I am when this gets out.

All I know is that he was in talks with Slush. But the surprising thing is that the number of unpooled miners is almost as big as that pool as well.

I don't work for any pools, not anymore.

I told you guys a storm was coming but nobody listened. This was the pool scam cashing out on false transactions.

None of the successful pools are just 1 man operations. Not any more. 
Sure they started that way but as you start to deal with bigger amounts of money more people need to get involved.

They are able to send payment's "on behalf" of other people along with enough confirmations to trick the system into believing that it's legit.

Most of the people think they have been keylogged/hacked.
