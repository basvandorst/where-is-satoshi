You'll never know how the price will go up or down. If we knew back in 2010's now all of us would have a Lamo minimum ! :)
But what can you do is just hold and wait for the price (up/down) .Two ways, up either down.

Use VPN to connect to your Coinbase/Gemini account.
@_date: 2019-11-09 07:45:32
Nobody knows, but the best option is to hold (my opinion).

This week we will see a new huge dump to 9.5k. My prediction! :)
@_date: 2019-11-22 08:39:24
Did you have any dreams about this last night?!
@_date: 2019-11-22 20:53:53
I think will be exactly the opposite.
@_date: 2019-11-04 09:44:34
Use [localbitcoins.com]( , you can trade there paypal-&gt;btc (the exchange rate is not so good)
@_date: 2019-11-12 08:11:36
@_date: 2019-11-01 14:43:42

Not all the users requires documents proof. But the exchange rate is better if you choose people who need documents proof.
@_date: 2019-11-19 09:03:13
Just hold, it's the best and only option that can make you rich :)
@_date: 2019-10-29 13:46:02
Almost there, GO UP!!
@_date: 2019-10-29 11:20:35
You can try [localbitcoins.com]( , the exchange rates aren't so good but you can try there.
@_date: 2019-10-31 11:27:11
JUST hold !! you'll see a bigg UPPP!
@_date: 2019-10-31 08:27:36
Depend on where do you buy, because i don't think you can buy bitcoin at current market price. For me on localbitcoins when i bought, the market was on let's say 7500$ / btc and i bought somewhere +200-300$ and from the start i loose, i needed to wait until the btc price will rise over 8.000$ / btc so i can sell and make a profit.
Good luck!
@_date: 2019-10-29 13:56:01
Will be a long countdown with UPs and DOWNs!! Don't sell just hold
@_date: 2019-12-02 13:57:37
You're right , best choice is to hodl btc and don't give a f\*ck what other says.

 Tyler and Cameron Winklevoss are currently worth around $900 million to $1.1 billion each. In March, 2013, they together bought about 100,000 bitcoin, when the coin was worth roughly $120. Today 100,000 bitcoin is worth about $625 million. The twins are famously called "the world’s first bitcoin billionaires."
