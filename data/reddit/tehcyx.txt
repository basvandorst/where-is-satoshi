Why is the segwit adaption growing to 20%? Is it more people using segwit exchanges or (small) exchanges adopting it?

1. Ok good to know. 
2. So wouldn't there be an option to create such a derived address let's say for a paper wallet that? How would you create such an address? Is that built-in for example in the desktop wallets or hardware wallets? When transferring from an exchange to a desktop/Hardware wallet it would be best to have such a derived address, right?

That's good and bad I would guess. Since the adoption doesn't grow.

Did I miss the actual update of when coinbase/gdax are going to implement segwit or did they just never say that?

I'm just trying to get my head around how all that works.

Just throwing that in here as a Playlist:

Too bad, they should say something.

1. Can someone ELI5 why when I have a paper wallet and I remove money from it, I should transfer everything out and when I have a desktop wallet or hardware wallet (at least I haven't read that so far) I don't have to? Are these wallets doing that for me automatically?
2. When people post a Bitcoin donation address, is that the public key of their hardware/desktop/exchange wallet or is it a specific wallet they use for the donations only and transfer funds around later? I mean in the end, through tx history you would find out anyways if they transfer it all the time to the same wallet, right?
Appreciate any explanations

OK, thanks!

Wasn't the 10k dip just an example of them shutting down service a few days ago? If I can believe what I read on here. 
Also wouldn't I avoid high fees with SegWit from what I've been reading on here? So an exchange that is already SegWit enabled would be a better start or no? 
Sorry I've just started reading into everything and then I also follow comments and threads on here that get me confused.

A question if I may: what is the difference between using trezor, ledger or just a laminated paper wallet? Can paper wallets have segwit addresses? When I start investing should I immediately transfer the funds out? Should I have multiple copies of paper wallets?
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:37:42
True. Thanks for the insights

Is it still good to start with Coinbase as my first market for investing? People on this sub seem to talk bad about it since the last dip. Any good alternatives that may already have segwit (US)?
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:59:06
Will do, thanks.

Ah good to know. Yeah I didn't mean they caused the dip but kind of, them shutting down during a time where a lot of people would've tried to buy in.
