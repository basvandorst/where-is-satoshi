I feel that all indications point to decentralization and digitalization of currencies, whether or not we can escape government's control of the financial systems will be up to us a collective, it will be messy. But, I too am on the side of crypto, it is the only chance we have to free ourselves from their system.
We need to be the change that we wish to see in the world!

Thank you, I appreciate the effort, you are promoting something that we all believe in here. Great job!
@_date: 2018-01-25 21:17:51
Me too, please

Why, do you need a thousand votes to do this? Can this not be just done by your own volition?

I would like to tip you for this post. where should I courier the gold too? my horse and cart are on standby to waiting to deliver.
@_date: 2018-01-25 16:38:56
Oh, I get it now. Bitcoin is double plus bad, but its main component is triple plus good, thank you for clearing that up Big Brother.
@_date: 2018-01-21 22:13:19
Cognitive dissonance then.

Bitcoin is more than a fiat dollar value, Mr.Expert sir.

I banned facebook years ago, it took them a long time to retaliate! 
@_date: 2018-01-21 22:56:16
I agree completely, and I am glad you have such a well-rounded argument. We need more humans like you. Some people just like to spout terms without any real idea what it is they are actually saying. You are clearly not one of those and I appreciate your articulate reply.

Both, it all depends on which side of the fence you stand. 
In either case, it is not going to be easy....
@_date: 2018-01-21 23:33:02
Yes, I could have termed it more politely, my apologies. I was trying to extrude your argument while siding with brevity. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 04:37:53
It has nothing to do with superstition and everything to do with a synchronicity or a meaningfully related causal sympathy between the macrocosm and the microcosm. 
In short what I am watching the Saturn/Pluto cycle which is coming to an end in 2020 in Capricorn the sign of big business.
Pluto entered Capricorn in 2008, This saw the beginning of the sub-prime mortgage crisis, the bank bailouts and the birth of Occupy Wall St. Also at the same time, the plans began for the worlds first cryptocurrency (Bitcoin).
Pluto just passed the 18th degree of Capricorn which is known Astrologically as a deflationary zone, so I expect massive market contractions to begin in the next year or so. Pluto destroys very slowly, but very powerfully.
On top of that the planet Uranus who has correspondences with technology, liberation and personal freedom, revolts, and revolutions. Will enter the sign of Taurus this year first in May of 2018, But the full effects won't really be felt until sometime after March 2019. 
Taurus is a fixed earth sign, which rules wealth, banking. 
So, the simple question to ask is what happens when the planet of personal freedom and liberation enters the sign of wealth?
And yes I use Astrology to trade, in fact, I discovered Bitcoin first through Astrology it was predicted to come about long, long ago.

OK,  so what will end well then?....... 
@_date: 2018-01-14 00:47:43
We just need to stop cashing out, back into their fiat system and we will be fine.

If you are an anarchist, why do you feel the need for there even to be officials? Anarchy is derived from the Greek word Anarkhos, meaning one without rulers.

Full Moon eclipse at 1:27 pm UT 0:00, I will be buying after that and selling on the 7th of February 
@_date: 2018-01-19 03:45:30
Good more for me.
@_date: 2018-01-11 02:24:53
Yes, just wait till Uranus bombards Taurus later this year
@_date: 2018-01-18 18:19:12
1. The system has already toppled, it is being artificially propped up
2. I am pretty sure that we will get screwed again, just like every other time in history. Even if we have a revolution we will just breed a new generation of tyrants to rule. Nothing will change until people think for themselves and stop searching for a leader to tell them how to think. The problem is us and not them. We like to give our power away for the illusion of safety.

In a crypto world, why would we even need banks?

What a savvy investor, everybody knows that Lamborghini only ever appreciate in value overtime.
He will become very rich from that Lambo some day.

For me personally bitcoin has performed the best, alt coins have been hit or miss. So I think you made a great investment! 
@_date: 2017-06-02 03:21:23
It means nothing unless they are aspecting planets in bitcoins radix chart. Jupiter is currently slowing to station and is square to bitcoins radix Sun. Last hit was retrograde jupiter on the 26th of May, next square of Jupiter to bitcoins Sun will be on June 23rd. This time it will be direct!
@_date: 2017-06-13 02:38:50
Buy the dip and HODL the peak, they are not making anymore bitcoins after 21,000,000! scarcity is the key to Bitcoin, unlike Eth. 
@_date: 2017-06-20 22:27:49
Bitcoin will continue to rise today and tomorrow with sharp price adjustment on the 23rd. Just a hunch.....
