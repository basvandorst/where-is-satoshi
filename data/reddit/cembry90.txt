Price crashing... [$5 now]( Sell, sell!
@_date: 2014-08-28 01:55:14
Yeah you're right about the math bring wrong. Think about it like this. Let's say an arbitrary number equaling 5% of the network is just 5 units. So there are 100 units total and this warehouse has 5 units, or 5%. Every time you add 5 units, that means there's more total unis. So to go from 5% to 20% for example, you need to go from having 5/100 units to 24/119 units (+19 units for +15%). And for 50% you would need to go from 5/100 to 95/190 (+90 units for +45%). So for these warehouses to have 50% of the network, there would need to be 95 more warehouses built. This is not taking into account the increasing difficulty though.

I'm not in any way claiming that they're doing it intentionally, but it's possible; it's definitely having the effect of causing the price to drop with each sell period.

Long story short there was this old site, Magic The Gathering Online Exchange, that was rebranded into a Bitcoin exchange; they named it Mt. Gox for short. For a long time, before the exchange went under, concerns grew that the exchange was insolvent; that if everyone wanted to withdraw their money at one time, they didn't actually have enough Bitcoin to allow that. Then one day, Mt. Gox came out and said they got hacked. The site shut down, it went to court, and people submitted claims to get their money back.
 
Flash forward to today, and the trustee appointed with recovering enough USD funds to repay all of the Mt. Gox customers. He's been selling Bitcoin in large amounts at one time - 6,000 BTC on December 22nd, 8,000 BTC on January 17th, 6,000 BTC on January 31st, 6,000 BTC on February 6th. Each of the times these Bitcoin were sold, the price of Bitcoin dropped thousands of dollars.
 
The fear, and why people are concerned about this, is that the previous transactions are only 26,000 BTC out of some 200,000 BTC that were stolen. Current estimates are that there are still somewhere in the range of 180,000 BTC that the trustee is in possession of, waiting to be sold; the concern is that if the price of BTC has fallen as far as it has with just a fraction of the overall BTC that were stolen being sold, how much farther can/will it fall if the selling continues?

I'm actually not  directly affected as I didn't store my assets on Mt. Gox long term (specifically, at the time of the incident), but excellent advice.
@_date: 2018-03-07 19:05:08
Fair enough, then just prorate their original USD value in terms of the current value of BTC so that if the customer is then able to decide what they want to do in case the value of BTC increases (or decreases). At least we won't see the market plummet as much, provided some of the customers will want to retain their BTC.
@_date: 2018-03-07 17:09:12


Or, you know, just give the people their money in BTC and let them decide what to do with it. This is horseshit.
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:43:51
No! I was planning on selling both of mine [for $35k each]( and purchasing 14 bitcoins when the price drops to $5k. When the price of a Bitcoin hits ATH at $25k, I'll cash out and have a quarter of a million dollars after taxes. Sure I'd have no nuts, but I'd be rocking that sweet, sweet Lambo for compensation.
@_date: 2018-03-08 03:17:07
That doesn't force exchanges to follow them though. Securities laws apply to ICOs but to this date, not a single ones has registered with the SEC.
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:32:02
Maybe, but not a set of nuts on par with a Lambo.
@_date: 2018-03-07 20:36:50


Fair enough, I misspoke in that regard.


Sorry, let me reiterate that. It's horseshit that it even needed to get to that point. Mt. Gox could've and should've stepped up and put their big boy pants on and taken care of it themselves. But they didn't, and instead Mark Karpeles sat on his ass sipping Starbucks and let the courts drag it out; all the while, the price of Bitcoin has had its ups and downs, but those affected were entirely unable to touch their assets. Personally I'm unaffected as I never left my assets on Mt. Gox, but I can at least sympathize with the general sentiment.
@_date: 2018-03-07 20:11:45
U.S. laws don't necessarily apply to Chinese exchanges, unless the exchange agrees to abide by them for one or more reasons (such as to comply with U.S. regulations). They could've handled it in a number of ways, arguably better or worse. Take for example what BitFinex did when their users lost their money - they didn't credit them in USD, they created a new coin and credited them in that. Or what Bitconnect did - they didn't credit their users in USD, they credited them with worthless BCC.
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:35:13
So does that mean they give out free money, like a tax *credit* instead of being taxed? Asking for a friend.

If you're talking about Coinbase:
- Bank verification: 2 charges of $1.00 to $2.00 that are canceled when you verify them.
- Identity verification: answer about 5 questions regarding credit lines, addresses, loans, etc.
- Once you make a transaction, you have to wait 30 days. After the 30 days, you can buy 10 BTC per day instantly. Recently, they added a beta 1 BTC per day thing for users that aren't fully verified, but you have to wait the full 30 days to have the 10 BTC per day limit.
Not sure about MtGox:


In the past two months Mt. Gox has invested in more than doubling our verification support staff, and we are currently able to process most verifications within 24~48 hours.
Also, I believe you have to use wire transfer if you're outside of Japan:




That can be really expensive (1500 Yen is about $15 USD, PLUS any fees your bank charges for sending).
Personally, I use CoinBase to go from real money to BTC, to MTGox for day-trading, then back to Coinbase when I want to cash out or add more BTC.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:54:15

@_date: 2013-11-25 16:56:34
Some maths:
3.99 USD for 0.03045168 BTC which was $131.02725 per BTC at that time
Had you kept it, the price increase from $131.02725 to $815 (as of Nov25 2013 12:00 PM EST) is roughly a 522.13% increase (622.13% total).
That same $3.99 would be worth about $24.82 now :)
@_date: 2013-11-11 04:36:02
Yeah, it was really weird. I would have figured that would be the case, so maybe the websocket sent some bad info for whatever reason? I'm watching the charts as well and there's no significant change in value. Oh well. :)

They don't login and verify. It's all automated and a very fast process.
- Bank verification: 2 charges of $1.00 to $2.00 that are canceled when you verify them.
- Identity verification: answer about 5 questions regarding credit lines, addresses, loans, etc.
Now that my information is on their system though, that's another thing. Should they have a malicious administrator, they would have access to my bank account. But thankfully my bank has no objections to its members filing disputes so that's less of an issue. Just keeping a weekly eye on it like normal, to be honest.
Once you make a transaction, you have to wait 30 days. After the 30 days, you can buy 10 BTC per day instantly. Recently, they added a beta 1 BTC per day thing for users that aren't fully verified, but you have to wait the full 30 days to have the 10 BTC per day limit.

Your image literally suggests "Buy BTC on ideal market" and "Sell BTC on ideal market for USD". How is this anything other than arbitrage? Arbitrage, by definition, is the practice of taking advantage of a price difference between two or more markets.^[1] If you believe this isn't arbitrage, then you're very mistaken.
 
If it weren't for the fees and difficulties associated with buying or selling on other exchange sites, people would be doing this more often. Otherwise, it's not a 'bad' idea.
 
First, the market is extremely volatile. Not only do you have that, but now you're adding in the number crunching associated with making conversions from one to the other. At the time of writing this, MTGox is $808, Coinbase is 818, and BTC-e is $723.
 
|Exchange|deposit fee|withdrawal fee|
 
|Exchange|Min. Deposit|Min. Withdraw|Max Daily Deposit|Max Daily Withdraw|
|Coinbase|||0/10/50 BTC|0/50/50 BTC|
 
**Delays (business days)**
|Exchange|Deposit Delay|Verified Deposit Delay|Withdrawal Delay|Verified Withdrawal Delay|Extra Delays|
|Coinbase|7 to 10 days|50 BTC instant|7 to 10 days|50 BTC instant||
|MTGox|1 day|1 day|1 day|1 day|up to 2 weeks for $10,000 or more|
|BTC-e|72 hours|72 hours|72 hours|72 hours||
 
But with all that said and done, if you can look past the pain in the ass it is to trade back and forth from exchanges to your bank and you are sure to calculate in the fees which you incur, you just might make a little money.

2 [Verify email, phone, bank](
