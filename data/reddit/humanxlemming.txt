Might want to add more than just Mtgox since they have been known for some iffy stuff.
that is a website I use and you can choose what price you want to track.
Firefox version would be really great :D

Straight to the point and so very true.

SR going down affected BTC for like a day and a half before the price went up again and BBC will probably say something like it crushed the price of BTC when it never did.

Bit of advice stay away from bitcoins and ebay all together they should never meet unless you are buying bitcoin stickers or something like that.

Here is an easy one check the number spacing on 
Transaction numbers compared to branch numbers seem to have different spacing.
Lets not forget that the logos look like they where drawn in pen and then scanned into a computer to print fakes off.

If you are going to start working with bitcoins it would be easier to see about hiring some help to work the it side for you and it will really help your business expand into a growing market.
Plus lets not forget the fact that bitcoins are only ever going up in profit so you will be earning more than you will know what to do with.

Bitcoin shows up in a lot of steam and tf2 trades which is really great for both communities.

Its the BBC they will put a negative spin on it as much as they can but like always with bitcoin any news = more value.
@_date: 2013-10-24 00:22:09
Mind with bitcoin it will take a lot to make it drop so the BBC can say whatever they want bitcoin will only grow.

You could just exchange them for usd and let paypal convert it for you only problem is that is expensive as hell.

Thank you so very much :D the second I saw this I signed up.

More bitcoins that are floating around are better :D means people might find another kind of crypto currency to mine with the current asic miners.
