It's likely that right now U.S. and Hong Kong regulators and enforcement agencies are investigating Bitfinex. Not just because of the Bitcoin theft. The possibly illegal plan to haircut their customer accounts will mean they will face lawsuits, scrutiny from payment providers and banks, and investigations by law enforcement and regulatory agencies.
The end is coming for Bitfinex, governments and big banks are not going to let this happen.

They don't delete your account or any information associated with it. Ever.

It's wallets. When a new user signs up they get wallets for BTC, ETH, LTC (cos GDAX), ETC, USD. On top of that users can make more wallets themselves. Unless Coinbase publishes methodology for this number that shows otherwise, the larger part of the increase is probably the increase of wallets per user.

Is 'virgin' still an insult where you're from? That's hilarious all by itself.

If that's accurate, then after the Gemini auction at EOD would make sense.

This is a kind of technical analysis. It's based on economics from pre-information era models of productivity / value / work. Those models don't work after 1980. But for some reason people keep overlaying the pretty patterns and making assertions. The reason it doesn't work, is that you can write a book (work) and make infinite copies (productivity) without having a way to really put a value on that anymore.

I think he is referring to Olaf, actually. He left and started Polychain.

I tell people it's too risky, and they should wait a few years until it's part of a stable eco-system. Too dangerous to gamble your life savings with. Then I also refuse to give or sell them any. This usually prompts them to read up on it, starting with the assumption it's a little bit interesting.

You're making the bitcoin community look bad with your poor English and incessant trolling.

What do you think the halving of the bitcoin reward helps you with?

OKCoin and Bitfinex use the same bank. These exchanges ignored US regulations while allowing US customers. It was always just a matter of time before this happened.

I probably would use some version of this service. But I wouldn't want to meet you because you come across as defensive and that's not big service, sorry. Far from needing to defend yourself, you just needed to come across as actually providing a vip service. You don't. BTW, no need to keep defending yourself when nobody asked you to.

Surely this qualifies as a parody video in both cases.
@_date: 2016-02-27 01:34:26
I mean specifically what will the halving do? For example, do you believe your net worth will increase somehow? If so, please explain because so far I don't see any connection between the bitcoin miner reward halving and you moving to a new place. Also, happy cake day!

Your business model is based on the idea that people can't sell their crypto, but selling crypto is easy and cheap these days. Three years ago there were multiple services that let you spend your BTC anywhere online. You would send them the crypto and they would place orders on your behalf via a pretty nifty browser plugin. They marked up a %, it worked well. But they went out of business because they're no longer needed. Now we have good exchanges, and shift cards. You're about three years late with your business idea. If I want a $50k watch I'll just sell some crypto and go buy one - I don't need you, and neither does anyone else.

Transaction logs would be a more likely target for replacement than databases. If blockchain technology is not fit for use by the finance industry then it won't get adopted by them.

Bitcoin is only one implementation of Satoshi's breakthrough. It's naive to think there won't be other successful implementations of the same or similar technology.
@_date: 2017-04-27 02:04:06
Instead of being defensive, how about asking what services people want and how much they would pay?

You made one chart look similar to another chart. But, correlation does not equal causation.
@_date: 2018-07-19 14:43:06
I get you, but that means all events are comparable across time depending on scale. I also suspect that the scale doesn't matter. Most people that would have been holding 100 BTC in 2013 are not going to have 100 BTC in 2018. I'd love to see price/users as a metric instead of price.

I think what the commenter implies is that large investors don't have access to Bitcoin exposure, and an ETF will resolve some of that issue. That alone may apply buy pressure previously unseen in BTC trading since it's a one-way gate. They can't suddenly sell what they don't have. The price probably goes up as new money tries to get in.

The world has seen Bitfinex lose 112,000 BTC. Their security is bad, and they lost customer funds as a result. Only MTGOX was worse.

If the chart represents Bitcoin adoption, then we have just reached the words 'take off'. But humans can pattern-match this chart to just about any situation so it works at every stage if you want it to.

Only the USD fiat is insured. That's FDIC insurance. Your crypto is not insured anywhere, not Coinbase or any other company. The Coinbase hot wallet is insured, but that's their Bitcoin, not yours - if hackers drained that your balance stays the same and coinbase loses a few thousand BTC and hopes insurance pays out for it.

What I'm hearing is that rootstock will arrive and do everything ethereum does, thereby wiping out ethereum's usefulness. This sounds remarkably similar to litecoin wiping out Bitcoin or any other number of similar examples. Hell, even ethereum does everything Bitcoin does. Just faster and cheaper - that doesn't mean everyone suddenly stops using Bitcoin.

Show me in the terms where it says that. They are holding over a million BTC in cold storage, there's no insurance company in the world that would take a $2B bet on that.
@_date: 2017-05-22 16:57:46
Only the hot wallet - not cold storage. From their website:
"All digital currency that Coinbase holds online is fully insured. This means that if Coinbase were to suffer a breach of its online storage, the insurance policy would pay out to cover any customer funds lost as a result."
Notice it says 'online'. I don't have preconceived notions, it's what the text says.

Most safe deposit boxes are just a room in a bank office. As secure as any other dry-wall office room. Too many movies have convinced people otherwise.
