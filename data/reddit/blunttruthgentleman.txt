The fuck is bitcoin cash plus.  Is bitcoin cash forking too?

This mentality is far too politicized to clearly interpret the facts. Believe what you must, but the day you realize btc has become the most 'normalized' crypto out there the more objectively you'll be able to decide how to proceed. 
Btc is my original true love, but if it were released today as a brand new crypto with its current tech and future plans it'd be labeled a shitcoin and fail.

**u/PineappleFund, you have just literally made my heart skip a beat!**
I work with charities, specifically in helping finance them, and literally cleared my schedule tonight to log onto reddit **with the sole purpose of making a post to r/bitcoin to ask them to donate to what I consider the {best and most in-need charity I've ever worked with.]( This was meant to be!!  
Please spend a few minutes on some of the artist bios and I guarantee you you'll fall in love like I have, even after feeling dead inside working with finance.  The studio impacts those who it's designed to help even moreso.
I just had the fortune of sitting in on their Annual General Meeting and despite their success in the communities that they nurture, they have 3-4 years left before they can't financially support themselves.  They subsist almost entirely on donation, with artist fees helping as well, but they've kept fees as low as they can to allow access to all families with developmental disabilities regardless of income, with the goal of making it free.  One can hope!
My goal tonight was to write about how much a large donation would help not only Bitcoin but also local charities, and to take the opportunity to inform the public in a local interview, putting our knowledge and goodwiill to use.  Little did I know I'd log on to find a post ASKING me to post this, but you've done just that!!!
They're a registered charity and the donate button should take you directly to their CanadaHelps registered donation page (gives you a tax receipt too).  I've been helping them for free for as long as I can and have donated everything I can outside of my time as well.  Every day that passes I think about what I would be able to do if I had the wealth of some of the high BTC holders, but I do what I can.  I have .3 btc and I talk to people about it every day just like many in this sub - doing god's work!
Going to PM this as well.  Thank you so much *PINEAPPLE PRINCE!*
Note: I do NOT profit from the charity in any way and the few staff on payroll barely do either.

Have you considered donating toward mental health for the developmentally disabled?  It's a particularly forgotten realm in the charity space without much glamor, but given that they experience emotion on a spectrum beyond what we're capable of, mental health for them (and their families) is incredibly important.
I submitted an application for them a week ago and haven't heard back from you, though I think about it every day. Please see what you can do, and consider donating! The charity helps those with developmental disabilities achieve mental health through art and hands on workshops and has an amazing track record:   I recommend spending a few minutes on some of the artist bios!  
Anything will help them really, but they're at a deficit every year now and could really use an endowment. Do you think you'll be donating?  Should I apply again?
PS: I didn't mention this in the application I made but the website is new (formerly H'Art of Ottawa, so if you google that it'll bring you to the new site as well), but the charity is still using H'Art of Ottawa email, and can't afford to have someone set up the new email yet, so don't use the being studio email address because we can't access it - use admin instead. 
Thank you for reading!

Ban incoming
@_date: 2019-03-03 07:52:51
Ok now there is no doubt you're retarded. This sub is literally infamous for bans and was posthumously awarded the most ban heavy sub on reddit, hence the original joke. 
If you dont believe me set up an escrow bet for 1.0btc and I'll give you 5:1 odds and deposit once you give me the link, reputable website of your choice. If your stones are as weak as your brain or sense of humor then stfu and accept defeat. I'm only answering to a placed bet.

Ok. So the segwit fork blocks are BTC and everyone who didn't fork is now producing BCC instead of the new segwit BTC?
@_date: 2019-03-03 07:35:33


First time here? 
@_date: 2017-08-02 17:10:13
Ah. So is bcash mined by btc miners? 
@_date: 2017-08-02 18:41:00
Can BTC ASIC's mine either BTC or BCC now?  If so, how is that decision made by the miner?
@_date: 2017-08-02 16:55:31
Is bcash the segwit btc fork?

Who's Mr botox?
Edit to a better question: what do these brothers have to do with crypto?

Sounds like Verge's retarded kid brother.
@_date: 2018-04-19 14:45:16
While being mostly true this is far from foolproof and a fuckload of work for a very mediocre result. 
The real answer is using an actual privacy coin. 
Verge is pure garbage for one of a dozen reasons, pick any 3 really. Monero is not as secure as it once was with the forking resulting in groups gaining potentially deanonymizing power over the blockchain (monerox for example). Onion coin (think tor coin), zclassic / zcash (Snowden's favorites) and bitcoin private (btcp, same teams as zcl) are currently the only ways to truly retain trustless anonymity. 
Dash may be another good option but I'm too unfamiliar with their tech to judge.

Newbie here, what will that do?  
@_date: 2017-06-30 15:32:39
It was intended comically.
