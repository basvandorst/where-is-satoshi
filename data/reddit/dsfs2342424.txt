I think you can cash out mtgox codes through bitinstant.com. They support ACH and paypal amongst other options.
If it's a larger amount then ask your bank for your account's SWIFT information and then enter that on the mtgox wire transfer form.

try  - there are people selling 0.1 BTC and you can buy via bank transfer. bitpay is a service that shops use to accept bitcoin.. it does not sell bitcoins.

That's quite interesting.. so there's something special about Uruguayan company law that allows you to sell shares in a private company to the public?

seems like you could just form an LLC in their field of membership.

at the moment $39.99 is around 0.39 btc ($100/1BTC).. although bitbargain sellers often charge a premium (it's still going to be the cheapest way for you to buy such a small amount imo).. any of the sales offers with a minimum of less than 0.39 btc should work. look for the blue 'change' button next to the Amount when you start a deal and change that to however many btc you want.

you can.. there's  which even allows you to buy using paypal. you have to buy SLL first, but you can just make up an avatar name.
There's also  and  which you can use by linking your credit card to liqpay.

ask your parents to put one of the bills into your name.. usually can be done just by calling up the utility.

fair enough.. registering a company isn't much more complicated than registering a domain name these days though.. you can do it all online in like 15minutes.. the fees are a bit more though, maybe $150 or so.. and of course there will be ongoing expenses to do with filing annual accounts, tax returns, etc. It's not worth doing just to 'support the credit union', but if there was actually a reason to bank with them -- like say trading bitcoins without getting shut down, then it could be worth it.
