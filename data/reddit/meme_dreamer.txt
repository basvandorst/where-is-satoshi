This has been the best explaination I could wrap my head around.

No expert but I would be curious to know what will prevent governments from simply making the currency illegal.  You start threatening the entrenched currencies what is going to stop them from banning any retailer from accepting bitcoin.  Further every time I hear about Bitcoins worth it is measured in US dollars.  It seems the entire currency is not worth anything as a currency but some manufactured scarcity.  It reminds me of the Beenie Baby market but digital.  It all comes back to dollars anyway from I read on all these boards.  Sure there are some retailers accepting bitcoins but could you imagine if Amazon decided to create their own currency and restrict their site to just Amazoins.  The US would roll tanks over their corporate headquarters.  It looks like it is going to be a fun ride but eventually governments who may not be able to stop Bitcoin would restrict commerce to only happen in their currencies.
These are all more questions I have than anything else.  I don't really see the need for bitcoin when I already have money that buys anything I could possibly want.
Edit:  grammar

Fiat system?  Educate me please.
Edit:  Fiat money is currency that a government has declared to be legal tender, but it is not backed by a physical commodity. The value of fiat money is derived from the relationship between supply and demand rather than the value of the material that the money is made of.

I understand their is no gold standard or anything backing the US dollar in an official capacity but I would say the petro dollar and by extension the US military backs up the dollar.  That said I'm rooting for Bitcoin and I enjoy lurking on this sub.

The problem with that with every thread I see the value of bitcoin is measured in dollars.  People are buying to make money not as a currency.  Looks like a manufactured scarcity to me comparible to tulip bulbs and beanie babies.  Now all these other crypto currencies are popping up.  Once grandma gets scammed the US is going to regulate it.  Not saying you can’t make money with bitcoin but that all people are burying it as an in investment to make money.  Looks like World of Warcraft gold farmers and right now there is a gold rush.
