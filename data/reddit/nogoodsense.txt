What konbini ATMs are you using that give you no-fee access? Is it specific to your bank alone?
Also bear in mind that Pasmo/Suica are both things that the people of all demographics (students to elderly, and both sexes) regularly use at LEAST twice a day for their commute. 
It's a single purpose cash card. 
I do not think that sentiment/use case translates into the larger ecosphere of monetary transactions. 
Take Edy for example. It's been around for a long time, but I have never felt compelled to use it over cash and certainly not over credit. Not universal enough.

There is something distinctly Japanese about this. (and not that it's happening in Japan). Like so forward-thinking and yet the surrounding atmosphere is so backwards that it makes no sense at all.
Japan is a cash-based society. Almost entirely. 
And yet ATMs close at between 5-7pm on weekdays, and sometimes completely on weekends. ATMs are closed entirely on national holidays. Year end? better get cash out beforehand or you're stuck for a week without access. 
Online banking is all but nonexistent. I shudder when I have to look at mine. I think last time I tried I couldn't remember one of the 4 different passcodes you have to enter before they show you anything. And even then functionality is laughable.
Autobill pay is just starting to make headway. 
but cellphones have had wallet functions for years now..even though you can only really use them at convenience stores..
and now they're officiating BTC?
I mean that's great and all, but I don't see this becoming meaningfully adopted anytime soon..
it just feels like they're doing this to encourage people to cash out in yen.

As someone who has lived in Japan for 11 years, I can say with full confidence that this will change nothing for the average Japanese person for at least 10 years.

With the way taxes are here, using Japan as a escape route for your riches seems like a foolhardy plan.

We have plenty of konbinis, but until recently no 7-11s :)

400k population, but yeah one of the most remote large cities.
