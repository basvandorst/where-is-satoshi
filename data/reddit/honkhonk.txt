Even so, there will be a time when you lose out on a block reward because you spent the extra resources including transactions while another mining pool who didn't include the transactions got the reward. Now your pool is out 25 btc because you included transactions.

It is against their self interest to include transactions in every block. They just need to include transactions in a smaller portion of their blocks so it doesn't affect the price too much. Maybe every other block they find will include transactions or something like that. Just enough to keep it going.

Are we going to stop with the "51%" posts yet?
A pool with 51% is going to happen sooner or later so there is absolutely no point in delaying it unless your are invested. This doesn't help the viability of Bitcoin at all and is rather selfish. If Bitcoin fails because of a pool with 51% then so be it - it's a fundamental flaw in the protocol that can only be mitigated.
Paper currencies can be duplicated by undesirables to a pretty accurate extent but this flaw can be mitigated with enhanced security features. This doesn't make the currency worthless.
People need to be aware and discuss ideas to mitigate the issue instead of posting these ridiculous warning posts hoping it changes anything.

You need to understand risk management. 
Yes a tsunami/earthquake could take out your house if you live near an ocean/fault-line. However, what is the chance of that occurring? How much will you lose if it does? And how much does insurance cost to minimise loss? If you find you have too much to lose you get insurance.
Yes your bank could declare bankruptcy but that doesn't happen over night or unexpectedly. In addition, your deposit is protected up to $100,000 or $1,000,000 depending on where you live and what certifications your bank holds. Even so, we are exiting a recession so this risk is very minimal now.
Yes you could die tomorrow but the much more likely case is that you won't. Wouldn't you want to leave a nice chunk of change for someone you care about? Why take on that much risk when you will likely live for many more years and have to endure your financial decisions.
Now look at Bitcoin, an extremely volatile currency currently on a long-term downward trend - and you want to sell your car for more of it. I don't think you completely understand risk and the advantage of minimising it while maximising your return.

Why would I use tigerdirect.com when tigerdirect.ca is cheaper after shipping/import fees as a Canadian? (not to mention longer shipping times). And there's already issues shipping to Canada so it doesn't seem very reliable.
Also,  displays a different error message than other non-existent pages so it could suggest the TigerDirect Canada will be allowing payment in Bitcoin soon.
Regardless, Newegg is generally cheaper for parts than TigerDirect in Canada. Plus I get 2% cash back with my credit card when I make purchases. So I don't see a lot of use as a Canadian buying from a US site with such a volatile currency while loosing a potential 2% in savings. To each his own I guess.

Then if I paid with BTC the price would still be the same. Are you expecting them to show a BTC price and a CC price? It's against the merchant agreement to have a surcharge for using CC's. So if the price is built-in, paying with BTC won't lower the price and I'll still get my cash back with my CC. Also, I average about 4% cash back not 2%. Realistically CC's will be here for a long time and I highly doubt my more expensive costs like insurance, phone bills ect. charge more to pay with a CC - they likely prefer it. If consumer prices are indeed inflated to cover CC costs to the merchant then as long as it's less than 4% I still save $ by using my CC. I'm not sure where you live but CC fees for merchants are from 1.5-3% not 5%.

"The EBA recommends that national supervisory authorities discourage credit institutions, payment institutions, and e-money institutions from buying, holding or selling VCs, thereby ‘shielding’  regulated financial services from VCs."
So basically the EBA doesn't recommend banks to invest in Bitcoin/VCs in the short term until appropriate regulations are in place to mitigate risk.
If I owned Bitcoin I would have sold on that news and bought back in lower (this weekend likely). I like how the top comment is "For those who panic sold, stop being so gullible." That mentality is just so stupid. If you had the chance to  sell relatively soon after the news release/bloomberg notification you definitely did the right thing. Don't let people fool you into holding when you should sell. Even now there's a short term down trend and fundamental news like this is one of the easiest ways to profit from.

Stop reading now unless you feel like reading a shitty rant.
I first heard about bitcoin in late 2011 and bought my first coins in Feb 2012. I've found for a while that I can't even relate to anyone here on anymore. 18 months ago when I started checking out there were some interesting articles and viewpoints with some good discussion by like-minded users and now it just seems overrun with libertarians and bitcoin fanatics who cant find 1 second to step back and consider an opposing view. The community needs to do an ego check and come back down to earth if they want to help adoption. and even are good at doing this. This community is self destructing because every time a new person comes in and sees the front page of they roll their eyes at all the crazy crap on here and they're turned off of bitcoin. But its fine because I don't care if bitcoin becomes a common method of payment or not. It's cool but seems pretty useless for micropayments at POS terminals which is where I spend 90% of my money. Now I only trade bitcoin for investment purposes and will likely never use it again for anything else.

From my understanding 0.6% of their coins (12,000,000/2,000,000,000) were "premined". Block 1 gave 12,000,000 coins which were distributed to the initial investors so technically GAW holds very few if any.
Satoshi on the other hand "premined" 0.0033% of all coins (700/21,000,000).
Neither seem to have any malicious intent. Paycoin kept their initial promise to pay their investors while we can assume Satoshi was testing the network. 0.6% of all coins however could be considered quite high but I wouldn't dismiss Paycoin as a scam just from this.

HOWEVER, there are much fewer than this. I can already see a couple locations in Toronto that no longer have ATM's. Decentral at 123 Spadina Ave. is one example. That bitcoin business has completely closed down. I wouldn't be surprised if even half of these ATM's still existed.

Doesn't Japan view bitcoin as a commodity not a currency and that taxes will apply to bitcoin transactions? I don't think anythings changed.
Japanese exchanges are subject to an 8% consumption tax rate.
Honestly, this is bad for bitcoin not good. Japan is trying to make their bonds more attractable by deterring the use of other potential currencies/commodities like bitcoin.

The point is that you dismiss everyone as a troll even when they provide valid points or arguments. It's like there is a switch in your head that makes you say troll when you fail to understand or disagree with another persons viewpoint. Even when you get heavily downvoted like [here]( which is what Aussie is referencing, should make you say "Hmm, maybe I should reconsider my stance or how I'm interpreting the issue".

You could set up two mtgox accounts: one in your name that matches your domestic bank account and another in the name of your Japanese friend that matches the account holder at a bank in Japan. 
xfer fiat to your domestic mtgox account -&gt; buy BTC -&gt; xfer BTC to your other mtgox account in your friends name -&gt; sell BTC -&gt; xfer fiat to Japanese bank.

I already looked into this. You need to be a citizen or reside in the country for 6 months (plus have some kind of study/work permit) and have a domestic mailing address or something like that - it's definitely not easy. However if you have a trustworthy friend in Japan that's a different story...If the withdrawals to Japanese banks are quick you could make a lot of money. 
As a Canadian...xfer fiat to cavirtex -&gt; buy BTC on cavirtex -&gt; xfer BTC to mtgox -&gt; sell right away on mtgox -&gt; withdraw fiat to Japan bank account -&gt; international wire xfer to canadian bank. repeat
All the conversion &amp; xfer fees aside you could potentially make a couple % profit per cycle and if it only took a couple days to complete the cycle this would be a decent method to make easy $.
Although I'm sure there's people that already do this so the profit margin with be very low (&lt;1% potentially or even &lt;0%) hence the ~13% price difference between the two exchanges. Is 13% enough to cover the fees? Find out and tell me.

I agree. The only issue is that if you account is inactive for a year and you deposit $, the dormant script could run and credit you $50 before you are able to make a trade. I think that's entirely unfair. Depositing $ should reset your account and make it active again.
But I agree with you, nothing has changed, we agreed to this article when we signed up and they don't have to remind us of existing ToS articles. If they send out an email to remind everyone before Oct. 23 that would be nice, but not required.
This shouldn't be a deal breaker at all and if you're even a low volume trader this should have no effect on you. It's kind of like a stupid tax.
@_date: 2013-10-18 17:42:55
1. You're right, I should never comment when I have an opinion...
2. Do people not read through their ToS when they signed up? This isn't new. They also updated their news feed reminding everyone of their old policy they are actually now going to enforce; however, I would still hope they send out emails to everyone before Oct 23.
3. Fair point. This would happen when someone opens an account and doesn't trade for over a year then moves CAD or BTC over and their dormant script runs before they are able to make a trade. This should restart the 1 year dormant timer and activate your account again.
It's odd that the script runs every week instead of the 30th day of every month (exc. Feb 28th). So they are deducting ~$11.53 a week? Doesn't make sense to me. I'm willing to bet it's run once a month and they deduct $50 if your accounts inactive and funds &gt; $0.

I'm with a medium-sized credit union. Vogogo wasn't in the bill payment system, I called and they added it the same day and I transferred over to cavirtex that afternoon. Vogogo is in the approved Bill Payment list that every bank has access too (even small credit unions). If they aren't adding Vogogo it could be because they know its being used to buy BTC and the banks probably don't like that. It just seems very fishy that my credit union has absolutely no issue adding Vogogo as a payment option but banks with all the resources at their disposal, are "unable" to do so.
Not trying to be sarcastic at all but, why are you guys still with big banks? (higher fees, less atms - see exchange network, less friendly/personalized service)
@_date: 2013-11-01 14:37:32
If I gave you the name of my credit union you would probably be able to figure out where I work.
I'm not sure where you live in Canada but here is a list of the largest Credit Unions in Canada: 
Meridian would be the biggest in Ontario and they seem to be the most viable option for accessibility/availability purposes.
It would be best to pick a credit union close to where you live. Setting up an account usually means going to the credit union and filling out an application on your own time - no appointment necessary (not in all cases though).
I switched to a credit union a year ago and have no regrets. The biggest pluses for me were: ATM &amp; branch located where I work, large ATM network with no fees (exchange network), no monthly fee - I get more than what I got paying $13 a month a BMO, tellers know me by name and are very easy and friendly to talk to - they are also more willing to go out of their way to help, ~50% lower fees on everything - interact email money xfers etc.
It just didn't make financial sense for me to stay with a big bank. I was essentially paying more for less.
Edit: I just realized my credit union isn't even in the Top 100 largest in Canada. That should give you some confidence that any credit union from that list is a viable option.
@_date: 2013-10-13 15:24:11

I'm not sure of the next time you will log in but I have a question that has been bugging me.
As an active trader on cavirtex I am amazed that the fee is still 1.5%. I noticed the fee structure has been changed numerous times in the past but 1.5% is significantly higher than any other exchange. Would you not earn more $ in fees by lowering the fee to like 0.75% and descend to 0.5% as user volume increases? If you cut your fee in half I have no doubt that volume would at least double (thus increase your profit). Most people are buying on cavirtex and transfering their BTC to bitstamp and then trading back to cavirtex and selling their BTC when they want to exit the market. Cavirtex is missing out on all the volume and profit that could be seen with lowering fees. It makes absolutely no sense to day trade on cavirtex when I can do so for the same price and higher volume on bitstamp now that it's at par (which I do now).
As a Canadian I would rather trade on your Canadian exchange but it just doesn't make sense given the 1.5% fees. Your exchange is only good for entering or exiting the Bitcoin market in CAD $, you're killing yourself IMO from the potential profit you could make.
 - look at the fees of your emerging competition. You won't be the leading Canadian exchange much longer with 1.5% fees.
@_date: 2013-12-10 18:16:59
I guess I should stop asking this but I'll do it again: Why are so many people still with banks and refuse to switch to a credit union?
I save quite a bit of $ each year with my credit union as opposed to when I was with a major bank. Large (and even really small) credit unions have the exact same features as banks at a lower fee. Mortgage rates are lower, I pay no monthly fee where I was paying $13/month at the bank for the exact same features.
Is there a reason or is it just laziness and the comfort of familiarity?
@_date: 2013-11-01 15:44:19
Been watching your exchange the last week waiting to make the switch from your main competition - I'm sure there are many doing this. Your fees are reasonable I'm just waiting on more volume - maybe now would be a good time to make the switch since BTC price seems rather steady at this point. I would be trading at a 0.4% fee on your xchage right now instead of 1.4% on youknowwho.
I have a recommendation though. I am unable to find your withdrawal/deposit methods without signing up for an account. It would be useful if I could easily see these methods and the costs associated with using them without signing up so I can understand my total costs incurred. Maybe add buttons to the top header on the main page. Your competition makes this easy to find and understand.

While you're here: I was wondering if their were plans to lower the 1.5% fee? I feel like the profit hit you take lowering it would be made up by the increased volume and make the exchange much more liquid.
