I wouldn't call it gambling, the winner will be determined entirely by their ability to solve the clues! There's no luck component at all.
@_date: 2014-04-20 10:18:29
Haha, I guess that's a step in the right direction. Don't worry, once someone solves them all I'll run through the answers with explanations, and you'll kick yourself for not getting quite a few of them!
Hmmm, I expect we'll tick up slightly over the next 2 weeks. Doesn't look like there's any bad news on the horizon...
Can I use the following as a quote?


@_date: 2014-05-03 10:11:54
1 bit = 100 satoshis
1 bitcoin = 1,000,000 bits
1 bitcoin = 100,000,000 satoshis

Exactly, you can already donate to Wikipedia via Jimmy Wales if you so choose: 1McNsCTN26zkBSHs9fsgUHHy8u5S1PY5q3
But obviously it'd be great to get bitcoin some additional exposure on Wikipedia.

This is what I'm getting at the moment:

If you're one of the first 10 you'll get a confirmation email requesting payment of 0.01, but you should just ignore that! I'll manually mark your order as payment received and will send the book to you upon its release in a week.
@_date: 2014-04-18 22:25:58
That would be my guess as well, but it'd be good to clarify this should anything go amiss in the future with any company he's involved with.
And naturally this wouldn't be for investment advice - as has been said already, the wise investor does their own homework and doesn't rely on one man's opinion.
@_date: 2014-04-12 10:19:42
Valid concerns! I'm not sure how best to address them, other than it would be a ridiculously drawn-out scam just to get $4 from people!
This is more of a fun little side project that I'm hoping will gain some popularity, which I can then scale up to a 10 Bitcoin Book or similar.

But hopefully the prize will be worth $500++ in a weeks time!
Didn't know that sub existed - great idea!

Thanks for posting this Andreas. I do have one question - which companies ARE you officially vouching for, if any, at present? Not just from a security perspective, but as a stable, low-risk, long-term business?
@_date: 2014-05-03 10:17:14
Fantastic news! Do we know if has any plans to migrate from milli-bitcoins to bits?
@_date: 2014-04-18 14:02:02
So you formulated a view back in late 2010, saw the value of it shoot up by over 100x and are now trying to overcome cognitive dissonance for not buying by now saying your predictions are proven right?
@_date: 2014-04-13 11:15:01
Thanks for the show of faith, you won't be disappointed.

Might be worth signing up to see if they do indeed give you a few satoshis, but I'd need to see a LOT more details about their business model before giving any of my own coins to them.

There's absolutely nothing wrong with LocalBitcoins in the slightest. The problem appears to be with users not having 2FA and re-using passwords/having keyloggers installed on their computers.
@_date: 2014-04-12 10:08:20
Don't worry, your coins are safe! Sounds like you took all reasonable steps - any weaknesses would have resulted in lost coins shortly after depositing coins in the wallet.
@_date: 2014-04-11 18:22:21
I really don't get why Chinese rumour dictates such drastic price swings - it's like Schrödinger's regulatory stance on bitcoin, which at any given moment can be thought of as both a ban and not a ban.
@_date: 2014-04-16 13:43:48
Encrypt it first then backup! Shouldn't have any unencrypted copies of your wallet floating around.
@_date: 2014-05-04 18:51:45
Wow, I think that's the perfect solution given a few people aren't keen on using bits as the standard unit.
Great work and a really quick turn-around. And thanks for the tips!
@_date: 2014-05-02 21:18:48
I think bits make perfect sense. If everyone that agrees starts using that by default when posting we should slowly start to move everyone over. For example, did you know you can buy over 2,000 bits for just a dollar?
@_date: 2014-04-12 08:02:37
Likely a very smart movie, especially in the long term. Though I have to ask, how/where have you stored the coins? The last thing you want is to leave them on a dodgy exchange or an un-encrypted wallet!
