Small blockist arguments are getting more and more ridiculous every day. Paypal charges way, WAY less. Every centralised money transfer company I knoe charges less in fact..

The whole point of this device seems silly. What stops me from making the exact same circuit board but with my own private key in it?




By actually making a transaction either through the lighting network if you're afraid of on chain transactions, or just a regular bitcoin transaction. You need to send your coins to the device anyways, so I dont see how that would be any different from an onchain transaction.
@_date: 2016-08-17 18:08:45
This is hardly 'proof' though.. It is extreemly difficult to spot it has not been tampered with. I would not trust this with any significant amount of money.
Seems silly in the whole bitcoin ecosphere to not use cryptographic proof that I dont own the private key.

With P2Ppool there is no single entity who controls the blocks being mined. It works by having a side chain with a lower difficult. For example 100 times as low. That means that once every 100 blocks a real block will be found, which pays everyone who mined an easier block since the last real block.
@_date: 2016-08-13 23:53:36
Actually it does.

Fees will be a % of transaction value instead of a fee per size. You'll need to open and close a channel once in a while which will take 2 transactions on the chain.
I'd expect fees to be close to 0-0.5%, but its anyones guess now.

Other people sell their gift cards with a discount. Various reasons, maybe their friend got them a 20$ Starbucks gifcard and they dont like coffee, so they'd rather have 18$. But tbh it smells like easy and way for carders to get money, fast, irreversibele and anonymous.
@_date: 2015-12-27 02:59:56
Merchants do give bitcoin value, but they only accept bitcoin because it has value.
Speculators give bitcoin value because they think they can make a profit by trading it. Bitcoin doesnt really need to have a value, as long as it is tradeable, speculators will give it value.
So in the end i would argue it's the speculators giving bitcoin value..

NSA can design their own sha256 asics but they wont be orders of magnitude better than public avaible ones. Thats why it if difficult for the nsa to gain more than 50%.

If you have no clue as to what the password is, there is no way to recover your bitcoin.
If you know that it is (for example) some variation of IlikeSteak58 where some letters may or may not be capitilised and the number in the end may be some other 2 digit number, you've got a good chance of bruteforcing it.

Thats true,but the most concering thing about big blocks is not the processing power, but the bandwidth. And bandwidth is not scaling anywhere close to what we need to scale bitcoin properly. 
We could bump the size up a bit, but imo that does not look like a viable longterm solution. Running a node at home is already non trivial. It would sadden me to see that a node can only viably be run in a data center, and lose any decentralisation that is left on the mining.

Expensive, dangerous, and I couldnot for a while cause I was not 18 yet.
@_date: 2016-01-02 22:27:04
Yet if you want to fully enjoy all benefits of bitcoin with 0% trust, you need to run a node. I get that my grandma will not run a node, and that is okay. But for a technical person it should not be a problem to run a node imo. Right now it is still somewhat doable( although not very practical). Why make it only doable for miners?
@_date: 2016-01-02 02:44:13
Im not saying we should do nothing. I am saying we should aim to develop off chain solutions like the lightning network as soon as possible. 
We need a real solution. I guess that in the meanwhile we can push the limit to 2 mb or something modest, but I'd rather solve the problem directly the first time instead of hardforking for a temporary fix.
@_date: 2016-06-26 17:21:57
We could not even fork to 2mb, changing the mining algo is waaaay more of a crucial change. Besides that there would be litterally zero miner support since they'd be losing their million dollar investment.
@_date: 2016-06-02 01:01:22
No it can not. Malicious nodes cant really do serious harm.

True, the vurnability was in the dao, not in Ethereum. But ask yourself this: the dao was no joke. It had 100m usd of investors, and had gone through security audits and was written by experienced coders and checked by hundreds of opensource developers. Yet it contained a crutical vurnability. If it is that difficult to make a secure contract, what is the point of ethereum? The next dao will have  a different kind of bug and will be exploited sooner or later. 
@_date: 2016-06-19 20:52:35
How is abusing the code to steal all eth in the dao not a hack? What would define a hack in your logic?
@_date: 2016-06-19 20:51:22
He abused a bug in the contract. That is litteral what hacking is.. 
@_date: 2017-01-29 14:11:10
That is a very good deal on the computer. I frequently browse the secondhand sites around here and a desktop like that would be atleast 100$, probably 150$.
@_date: 2016-06-19 20:49:02
Where I live it is certainly illegal. Otherwise all hacking would be legal, since you are just (ab)using the server as it is programmed to do.(read: exploit a vurnability)
In the law over here it is stated as 'Penetrating or otherwise manipulating an autonamic system in such as way that is clearly not the intention of the system'
I'd argue withdrawing all eth in the dao is not the intention of the smart contract, thus what happend is obviously illegal.
@_date: 2016-06-17 00:36:33
The value of the coin is what people are willing to do for it: the buying power. If I can buy a whole bread for 1£ but it costs 2$ over in the us, than appearntly 1gdp is worth more than the dollar.

Meh it is both. Having immutable javascript like code is just asking for vurnabilities. Nothing is 100% secure, making it immutable just makes it even harder.

While I agree that a hardfork would ruin Ethereum I dont think it is this simple. The DAO contract had a bad bug, but this will keep happening. The dao contract was audited, 100m usd worth of investors invested in it, yet it contained this seemingly stupid bug. 
Things like this will keep happening. The dao made a mistake yes, but deep down this is an issue with Ethereum. It is very, very difficult to make any meaningful contract that is actually safe in ethereum. Even though this was a Dao issue, and Ethereum worked 'perfectly', the Ethereum system failed. If it is this difficult to write a safe contract, what is the use of ethereum?
@_date: 2017-08-24 22:19:21

While it is indeed a cheap bet, you do realise just how much bureaucratic overhead there is in doing so right? In most countries there is not a single person who can say oh fuck it lets buy 1% btc. And even if there would be a person like that, he wouldnt because it would put him at great risk. Lets say Trump buys a billion btc with US tax payers money, and the next day bitcoin drops with 50%. Do you have any idea what kind of backlash he is going to get for that? No one is willing to stick their neck out like that.
Besides all (democratic) countries do have public records of their spendings, so if any big country was doing so we would have noticed.

@_date: 2017-08-26 16:09:57
Look the main reason I got into bitcoin was because paypal would reverse transactions whenever they feel like it, freeze my funds etc. Basicly all the reasons you named above.
However I can not use it if the transaction fees are near $10, thats just complete madness. I want that decentralised money, but with $10 fees it only makes sense in transactions of a few grand.
Sure buying coffees everyday is a bit too much, but buying my games on steam? Or ordering stuff from the US? I have been using bitcoin for about 5 years now, ordering stuff from the us as I was not allowed to have a creditcard yet, so it was basicly my only virtual payment option.
However the fees make it completely unusable for me. Whatkind of purpose has btc now adays? All you can do is buy and hodl cause selling is so expensive.

Completely agree.
ETH is centralised, premined coin with no cap on the coin supply. It is completely dictated by Vitalik and if he wants to reverse a transaction, he reverse the transaction. I get that they have some cool smart contract stuff, and do offer some nice features, but this in no way threatens bitcoin in the longterm as many on ethtrader seem to think. While ethereum has it's place, bitcoin will remain the store of value coin.

They probably do not want to keep changing their withdrawal fee every week as fees will keep rising. Also 1-1.5 is NOT enough at all times, maybe if you can wait 2 days before it gets in a block it's OK but as a company they probably do not want the tons of tickets being created by people not getting their withdrawals fast enough.
