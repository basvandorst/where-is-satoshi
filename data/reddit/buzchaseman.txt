Not entirely sure if you’re agreeing or disagreeing  with my point that both communities are nonsensically sabre rattling instead of getting on with the job at hand of promoting adoption, innovating, enlightening minds, etc.

Wow, you down voted me that - man, that’s cheap.
Look, I agree, Bitcoin Cash trying to label Bitcoin as Bitcoin Core is wrong! See - we agree.
But Bitcoin trying to label Bitcoin Cash as Bcash is equally wrong - the space gets nowhere like that - just noisy, irritating rattle to anyone who is new.
Frankly, off putting.

I hold both Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash and I’m new to this space so what little I have cost me quite a bit. I’m enthusiastic for both projects, but what I find most off putting is this venomous project rivalry and the bickering like kids. 
Honestly, you might be making good points in there but I completely switch off when I see you tossing around the name Bcash. It’s a shame.
The challenges facing this space are huge - metaphorical guns are pointed squarely at all crypto projects from the traditional vested interests and they have Gatling guns, while you rattle your sabres at each other.
At least start by respecting the brands. It’s a small step. You are Bitcoin they are Bitcoin Cash. We know this. Otherwise all that new people like me hear is ... rattle rattle rattle from both sides.

I completely agree that Bitcoin Cash allegedly (I don’t know as much about this as people here) purchasing domains and misusing twitter accounts is wrong, and I condemn it without reservation. In fact I think they do their own project a disservice because it reflects poorly.
Bitcoin is the solid, large, prestigious, trusted original, adult in the room - why not rise above it.
Edit: I admit that I am new and therefore may not know as much as most old timers here - but I am trying to be positive and constructive.
