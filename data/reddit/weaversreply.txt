Mate, I've lived in the 'States, I'll take our freedom over your freedom any day, a freedom that won't be taken away by anyone, because you don't know Australia and you don't understand Australians.

You drive on the wrong side of the road and do it in Mph. instead of a civilised KM/h.
The biggest company in the world, Apple, an American company, has it's flagship consumables made in China and stores it's profits in Ireland.
Ever heard of a little place called China?
They sort of ruled the world for about 3500 years, they've had a bit of a dip in popularity over the last 750 years, but they're on the way up again.

Did I buy the original "To the Moon" T-shirt. Sure did (still have it, though worn and faded)
Did I get burned at Mt Gox, Bit trader and a few other places? Sure did.
Did I reinvest, watch it dip, rise, dip, rise, rise, dip, dip, rise, rise,? Sure did.
Did I learn the value of HODLING along the way, sure did.
Did I learn the value of Alt-Coins and the spreading of risks, Sure did.
Point is, looking back over 5 yrs. I'm looking forward to the next 5 yrs.
I have a quiet giggle at all the economic experts with their multiple university degrees loudly proclaiming Crypto to be illegal, immoral, a sham, a scam, a ponzi, a passing fad, tulips, Beanie babies and dead in the water.

Yes, and legal action is going to fix that?
Best of luck with that!
Btw, I have BTC stuck in there too, after waiting in vain for 2 months for a cash withdrawal.
Legal action is NOT the way to go, next you'll want some regulating authorities to "control" Bitcoin.
I simply don't understand people who invest in things hoping to get rich overnight, crying their eyes out and running to the lawyers when things don't pan out the way they anticipated.
So I apologise for using the term bottom feeders, it's an insult to bottom feeders, mewling little cry babies is far more appropriate.
One would expect some "justice" if they'd committed some crime, so far all they're guilty of is delayed payments and already like a pack of rabid dogs you are baying for blood.

In years to come the decision by Overstock to accept BTC will be heralded as a milestone, it is the thin edge of the wedge.
This guy is in business, he has a legal obligation to do the best he can for his board and his shareholders, be innovative, be ahead of the pack.
The Bitcoin he holds came from us, the Bitcoiners, doing what we wanted to do with Bitcoin, use it, spend it, participate and you clowns are shit canning him with your 2nd hand knowledge and 3rd rate commentary.
I hope he makes millions and millions more, that means the ecosystem is working and will prime the pump for future expansion of BTC, so we can get to that point where mB is the every day measure of the currency.

Really enjoyed reading that article.
As I understand it, it "Bills" is not a new concept though, I remember reading that the Germans used wheelbarrow loads of the stuff in order to purchase a loaf of bread during the "depression" of the 1930's.
It also needs to be noted that "lack" of these bills affects people in a most peculiar way, stockbrokers for instance used to throw themselves off tall buildings when they discovered that they didn't have the same number of bills that they stated with.
It also caused Melbourne City Council to install safety fences on the West Gate Bridge to stop gamblers taking a high dive after losing their "Bills"
Lack of "Bills" also leads to people yanking ATM's out of walls, hold guns at other peoples heads or knives at their throats.
Having "Bills" cause people to buy cars that tell the world they paid more for their cars than you did and entitles them to use the public roads as if they own them.
In 1975, when Pol Pot took over Cambodia (Kampuchea), millions of bills littered the streets, blowing in the wind, totally worthless.
Methinks I'll stick with Bitcoin.

I'd like to think we're a bit different here, far less regulation, control and interference in your daily activities.
I'm going to go out on a limb, no doubt get down voted into oblivion and predict that within 18 months Bitcoin will be illegal in the 'States, mainly due to Wall Street, Banking and associated institutions putting so much pressure on the Government that they'll cave in.
What could be the saviour of the American economy will be demonised to such an extent that, whilst they can't stop Bitcoin, they can simply stop the trade in Bitcoin by denying access to exchanges etc.
BTW, there's a precedent for this, Americans can't be trusted to play online poker, this in the home of Poker, so the Government banned it, or more particularly it took only one arsehole senator to rip the guts out of a thriving online poker community, that brought in millions of $ to the American economy.
All it will take is for one arsehole senator like the clown that's running around now (can't be bothered to look up his name) for the Govt. to decide Bitcoin is wicked, evil, mean and nasty and with the stroke of a pen the Americans will be standing on the sidelines once again.

Trading on BTC-e now, both BTC and LTC, without a problem, able to transfer coins both internally and externally at will and without delay, to be fair, have not withdrawn fiat from BTC-e, don't intend to either.

Yes, you're totally correct, if the loss whatever the amount, was due to bad trades, the bottom dropping out of the market, panic sales or panic buys, then you and I would have no one to blame except ourselves, but this loss is due to either the incompetence or malfeasance of a third party like Gox, then it really sticks in the craw.
I had to provide documents to support my identity to Gox, in order to be verified, maybe it's time we asked for verification from exchanges before we invest in them.
Alternatively, maybe we should have a sub on Reddit where people up/down vote exchanges based on their experiences, we could start with 3 Exchanges, 1 in the 'States, 1 in Asia and 1 in Europe and exchanges could be rated as a Bitcoin trusted/distrusted exchange.

Don't jump to conclusions, I happen to agree with you, I was responding to the post by u/yubu, who went totally off tap.
Had the great good fortune over the years to have a few beers with a Gallipoli veteran, WW2 vets, Korea vets, Malay and Borneo vets, Vietnam vets and so on, whilst I can only speak for myself, my gut feeling is most of them would agree with you too.
Just the same, it still comes under the " All it takes for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing" heading, and it rankles and raises the hackles to read the drivel of someone like u/yubu who, most likely has done most of his fighting in bed.
Your sentiment was never more clearly expressed than by Eric Bogle, singing his version of "Waltzing Matilda", year after year more old men disappear.
The only time we truly fought for our freedom was WW2, when we pushed the Japanese back over the Owen Stanley's, In Vietnam we were supposedly fighting the spread of communism, what a fucking joke that was, but nothing like the current conflicts, supposedly the war on terrorism, which should be called the war to protect our oil and gas pipelines.

Before we had BTC exchanges in Australia, used to use a company called Technocash to fund things like (Shudder) MtGox, Technocash withdrew from the market, so the only way to fund was by wire transfer.
Wired $150 AUD, with the exchange rate almost on par with USD, it took about 6 hops, from bank A to bank B and so on, nett amount into the account after fees was $76.00
That's when I experienced what people who remit money to their home country experience and that's where Bitcoin is going to have a major impact.
For me it's just play money, for remittance people it's a major impost on their day to day financial affairs.
I use a local exchange now @ 0.02%, happy to pay it! hassle free! stress free.

There is much truth in the OP, the need for instant gratification hasn't so much crept in to Bitcoin as it has galloped in.
Hasten slowly, think things through, critically.

Nice work mate, really appreciate that.
I'm an unabashed CoinJar fanboy, simply because they're a bunch of young Australians, having a go, I like their enthusiasm.
I deal with them on a weekly basis and the odd time I've had a support query, because I stuffed up, not them they've been courteous, and quick to respond, can't ask for more than that.
After TechnoCash stopped taking deposits I thought here we go, stuck on a great big Island, cut off from the rest of the Bitcoin community.
Tried international wire transfer (to MtGox of all places) out of $Aud. 150.00 only $Aud. 75.00 arrived in my Ac., do the same with CoinJar and $ 150.00 turned up and we can be part of Bitcoin, just like every one else.

Bitcoin will go on, it can't be stopped.
Bitcoin was never about exchanges and becoming overnight millionaires, it's about a new, digital currency for everyone to use.
People use money every day, whatever it's form, whatever it's denomination, but I'd suggest less than 1% actually trade their money on exchanges, they just use it to buy goods and services, Bitcoin will just speed up and streamline that process.
Meanwhile, there will be a lot of people with egg on their faces when Gox fires up again.

Que Sera, this was actually the last bit of money I had left on Gox, it sat in the withdrawal Que. for over 2 months, that's why I traded it back in for coins, hoping to get them out that way.
Such is life, I genuinely feel sorry for ppl that have all their coin/money in there, there's been some really harsh comment about that on Reddit.
Like you I was an early adopter, still am and will be, BTC can't be stopped, tomorrow is another day.
Mean time the absolute best part for me is the 12 x 250w Solar Panels and 6 new 200ah batteries that BTC bought me, been totally Off Grid power wise for 14 months now and every time I walk out in to the back paddock I say a little Thank You to mr. Nakamoto, they also power the little mining rig that churns away mining LTC, a sort of Return on Investment.
Please don't take it to heart, my instinct tells me this is a small obstacle on the road to success for Bitcoin, keep the faith and enjoy the ride, we're in for some really exciting times.

Look, I hear what you are saying, currently I don't have any coin on any exchange, simply a case of not knowing who to trust, here in Australia CoinJar is doing a great job, but they too are subject to the vagaries of the system.
Personally I don't think regulation ( by whom) can and would work, if you're thinking the same bunch of self serving clowns that are running the system now, no thank you.
As a community we should be monitoring and controlling these exchanges, there's a lot of smart people here, far smarter then I'll ever be, that could (and should) have a system of checks and balances in place, standards to be adhered to, and failing that a progressive system of alerts as to whether an exchange is worthy of support or not.
First rule of deep holes is stop digging when you're in one, this lot would finance the shovels and tell us to keep digging without getting their own hands even slightly soiled.
I sincerely hope your pool flies, the more competition in the mining sector, the better for the whole ecosystem, but I figure that in no way would you want "Regulators" cramping your style and being obstacles on the road to success.

Me, every day, invested early 2014, cashed out (some, not all) during Dec 2014, bought 6 KW of Solar Panels @ roughly $1.00/watt plus another 6 x 200Ah batteries @ $500 each.
Currently (pun intended) living like a king, totally "off grid" with power to spare and no more electricity bills, with 3 teenagers in the house that have no idea that an "off" switch actually exists for anything electrical, this is a minor miracle.

Yea for Stars, good on them, I mean that whole episode was heartbreaking,it ripped the guts right out of Poker (for me at least) I was playing with ( and against) guys who we're paying for their college education, because they were bloody good and then the next day they were flipping burgers and pumping gas, all because of some brain dead, dumbass beurocrats.
On the face of it FT would have failed, same as Gox, because of market forces, first rule of deep holes is stop digging when you're in one.

I'd recommend Seals, it's easy to fund, easy to withdraw BTC. The games are good and the standards are good, they really deserve support.
Personally I rarely play these days, mainly due to work commitments and the fact that I'm building a house at the  moment, once that's finished I intend to retire and play full time.
It would be great if American players would catch on to Seals, I really miss them, I miss their style, their banter, their understanding of the game, I learned soooo much from them.
For a while, when FT came back, I could play at FT or Stars on my iPad, but those sanctimonious pricks at Apple stuffed that too, so now I need an Android device or a PC to play, they've taken all the fun out of it.
Check out Seals, you'll enjoy it.

First time I came across Andreas was just prior to the

When? Did the FT players get paid? I really hope so and would be more than happy to eat shit or humble pie if that's true.
I've basically stopped playing since Black Friday, the game really isn't the same without the Americans.
And for what it's worth I never thought FT was a Ponzi, grossly, maybe even criminally mismanaged, but never a Ponzi.

Actually, it wasn't, I really did it as a test and it failed, I'm not in the habit of relying on anecdotal evidence so I had to try it for myself and it was really the only way to get BTC considering my remote location.

Absolutely not, but the fact is that you can't make an omelette without breaking the odd egg, either deliberately or accidentally.
I know that people are human, first and foremost and they will take shortcuts to achieve an objective.
Life and events overtake people, you find yourself swimming in deeper water than you're capable of handling and you do your best to keep your head above water, that doesn't make you a criminal, it makes you a survivor.
If I was lazy I'd say shit happens.
I live in Outback South Australia, Charlie Schremm and I have, to the best of my knowledge never clapped eyes on each other, neither I have you and I, but I read your posts with a great deal of pleasure, they are well reasoned, thoughtful, eloquent if at times a little verbose, after all, why use one word when ten will suffice.
You character assassinate Charlie and damn him with faint praise at the same time, I haven't been on Reddit that long, but long enough to know that you yourself have not been the squeakiest of clean in your business practices in the past, seems to me that living in a great big glass house you'd be the last person to be throwing stones or casting aspersions.
ANZAC day here today, probably doesn't mean a thing to you, but as Australians and New Zealanders it's a reminder that you stick by your mates through thick and thin, to the bitter end, something you may want to reflect upon.

So let's take a look at 2 of them, Online Gambling and Tobacco Sales.
So as an average American guy I can't come home after a days work, boot up the computer and log in to my favourite poker site and play a $20.00 SNG or a $10.00 tournament and then at the 5 past the hour break, nip outside and have a quick smoke, unless I bought them from 7/11 or something.
Am I missing something? 
This much government control over your life is insane.

Agreed, but I don't believe that as a person who is invested in Crytocurrency, especially someone who is so invested as to open a mining pool you should be calling for judicial intervention, the minute something goes wrong, bring in the regulators.
We're trying to create an alternative, the bankers and regulators have been fleecing us for 200 years, they have no problem using other peoples money to finance their extravagant life styles, corporate jets, the whole shit box. Well they're welcome to it.
Do you honestly believe that as a mining operator you would NEVER make a mistake, that with the best of intentions you would not try to recover from that mistake, that things don't always go to plan?
How would you feel with a baying crowd outside your front door, looking to put your head on a stick?
Let the market sort this out, the believers will support them, the naysayers will just have to wait for their coin, it sure beats Gox's solution, I wonder what Karpeles is doing to feed his family this week.
@_date: 2014-04-27 02:00:08
Seems to me the current situation at Gox is similar to the situation with Full Tilt Poker after Black Friday.
Senior management at FTP got player deposits confused with operating expenses and were paying themselves huge bonuses, in the end the DOJ put a stop to that little party.
Much wrangling ensued over the assets (and liabilities) of FTP, the main liability ( and asset) was the millions of dollars worth of player deposits and accrued winnings, who would resuscitate  FTP and take on the liabilities.
In the end, PokerStars stepped up to the plate and payed out all players except for the Americans and is doing a great job running online Poker.
I have very little skin in the game, 5.7 Bitcoin at Gox is not going to make me or break me, but my worry is that due to some stupid technicality or the determined effort of some brain dead representative that last week couldn't spell congressman and now is one, the Americans are going to miss out again.
Whilst the rest of the world is playing Poker online, American players, in the home of Poker, are flipping burgers and are still waiting for their rightfully earned payouts.
On a personal note, I will NEVER come to terms with the fact that in the land of the free, the home of the WSOP, that a guy (or a girl) can't come home after a days work, boot up and play a $20.00 SNG online.
And if you American Bitcoiners don't see the corollary between Online Poker and Digital Currency then watch some Senator crawl out of his hole and introduce legislation to protect you from this evil, for your own good of course, can't have the mighty $USD undermined by some scummy, pretend "digital" currency.
Don't worry about the price of BTC, worry about the financial institutions when it starts affecting their bottom line, that's when the real fight for Bitcoin will start, it will make the Gox situation look like amateur hour.

@_date: 2014-08-05 09:27:56
I will probably get shot down in flames for this, but you'd have to be a lunatic not to invest (within reason) in Bitcoin.
Whether you're PAYG or Salaried, there's still the mandatory employer contribution, can't get away from that.
I was manfully salary sacrificing, until the much vaunted Industry Super fund started losing me 18% PA, in other words, I was working my little arse off and those clowns were losing my money for me, nice work if you can get it.
At the time I was playing poker online big time, my ROI was about 63%, not exactly WSOP material but significantly better than losing 18%, so I contacted the said Industry Super Fund and asked them for my Super, they couldn't see the funny side, no sense of humour, the answer was no.
So the money that would have gone into salary sacrificing, went in to shares and guess what, I'm still making a better return than the ISF.
But shares are dull, boring and colourless, so when Bitcoin came along I invested in BTC, best move ever, simple as that.
Bitcoin and everything that goes with it is exciting.
So here's a really simple recommendation, take it with as many grains of salt as you like, take 10% of your nett earnings! weekly, fortnightly or monthly, however you get paid and invest in Bitcoin.
Oh and for you people who think I'm just pumping up Bitcoin to secure my investment, I'm waiving at you, 1 finger at a time, I'm already financially secure.
I just have a quiet little chuckle at all these economists and directors of financial institutions like banks and ISF's that are so secure in the knowledge that their degrees and years of experience and arrogance confer on them, who could possibly never be wrong, will wake up one day, as the BTC train goes roaring past their station stand and wonder what the heck just passed them by.
Bitcoin is and will be important to millions of people around the world, someone from Holland tipped me a bit over 1mBTC yesterday, that felt really good, I'll add a bit to it and sent it to Sean's Outpost, in that way it keeps going around, easily, seemlessly.
In the scheme of things, my investment in BTC is infinitesimal, but with millions of people, like me investing in BTC, eventually we will degrade the financial institutions and relegate them to the dustbin of history, where they belong.

Raised a support ticket after about 3 weeks, got the usual "we're experiencing unusual demands and technical BS" and of course the usual "we're changing banking partners" and the mandatory "Thank you for your patience and we're working really hard" line.
So in short, raise a support ticket.
Meantime, personally, I don't believe MtGox is evil, I honestly think the demands put on their systems exceeded their experience and the ability of their systems to cope.
I hope they recover, for the sake of the Bitcoin community, I hope no one gets hurt by this.

Exactly, but no doubt you're familiar with the term " runaway inflation", here's some examples, the Weimar Republic, Greece and the USA, just keep on printing money, that'll fix it, don't worry about a balanced budget, it'll be ok.
If I ran my domestic finances like that, the bank would shut me down, only I can't print money, so the alternative is more and more credit, deficit spending, no thank you.
I've lived under the umbrella of 18% inflation! it destroys peoples lives! it destroys people.
The "recession we had to have" was going to make us bigger and stronger, it sure did, but it killed people in the process, literally.
Now we're looking at another 8-10 years to cleanup the financial mess the last lot left behind, before we're back in surplus.
I'm totally debt free, but I despair for people who, out of necessity, have mortgages, car loans and credit cards, student loans, at 2% that debt burden compounds annually and the banks and governments just love that.

A while back I put 5 x Bitcoin in 5 wallets for my grand kids, at today's rate they're worth 30x each.
Untunately my kids who are really smart educated professional people with multiple university degrees between them think the old man is off on another one of his crazy schemes and think BTC is a waste of time and space, so I've left instructions with my solicitor on how to handle the wallets and when.
Bruce's piece is so appropriate, it should be stickied, a lot of you young people have no idea of the incredible changes to society that the advent of the net ( only 25 years ago) has wrought on society, the way we communicate and interact.
Bitcoin is the most exciting thing I've seen in my life time, it will be the currency of the global village and for the naysayers in this thread, Bruce's optimism will be vindicated, better stock up on humble pie, you'll need it.

My real concern has been that "behind the scenes" lobbying by Banks and other threatened financial interests is corrupting what should be objective decisions and protocols by FinCen, ultimately making it impossible for Americans to participate in the Bitcoin space, same as they have been clinically excised from playing (online) poker.
The sad truth is that Americans can not ( legally) play online poker, this in the home of Poker.
Would it not be equally sad that in the home of Capitalism, the leader of the free markets, Americans would be unable to trade with and in, Bitcoin.

Just a "real" world example, a few years ago I bought some shares @ $6.40, within a few months they were trading @ $.0.40, if I had sold them that would have been a $6.00/share loss, just checked them, they're now trading @ $8.40 right now and I still won't sell them, this is a long term investment.
Just hang on to them, put your wallet in cold storage and come back in 12 months or 2 years.
Alternatively, use them to trade, 1 BTC is still 1 BTC, regardless of what it's fiat value is.

The guy was running a legitimate, legal business, the fact that some of his customers may have used his business, to acquire what may, or may not be, legal products puts him in the same category as a bank or any other store.
If I use the money in my bank account to buy a car or groceries it's legal, if I use the same money to buy a gun or buy drugs it's illegal ( here in Australia) either way, the bank ( or shop) shouldn't be held responsible for my purchasing decisions.
His Bitcoins we're not ill-gotten, they were the product of his enterprise, he provided a service, that's all.
The trouble with you Americans is that you are so regulated that you have regulators to regulate the regulators, most of them people who are just out to grab a headline anyway they can to further their own agenda, clueless about what they're really regulate.

Just on the face of it, of you're a PAYG tax payer you'd have to declare it as income only if you've cashed in BTC, as you've derived income, there may be Capital gains involved too, not your actual holdings as you haven't received any income on that as such.
No doubt people far more qualified than me will correct me on that, but that's the story I've got from a couple of tax consultants so far.

The solution is so simple, licence terrorism, 
In order to be a terrorist, first you would need to obtain a TL (Terrorist Licence)
This would entail spending years obtaining the necessary clearances from the usual 3 letter agency's, like the FBI, CIA, DOJ etc
In order to be allowed to engage in terrorist activities.
Anyone engaged in unauthorised terrorist activities would simply be shot or droned, no unlicensed terrorist activities allowed, thank you.
Properly licenced and authorised terrorists would then have to submit their paperwork to the tax department every year, same as anyone else, for scrutiny and to ensure they have paid the correct taxes, this would mean that a properly licenced terrorist could use fiat currency, Bitcoin or baked beans to further their enterprises, but the tax department (IRS if you're American) will get you in the end., same as Al Capone.

You may like his books but the message went over your head, try re-reading them a few times, they work on so many levels.
The philosophies expounded by the likes of Adams and Terry Pratchett are daily fare for Bitcoiners, if you can't see that there are alternatives, that there is a restaurant at the end of the universe, that the Zen method of navigation as practised by Dirk Gently actually works, every time, then maybe the idea of Bitcoin may seem pathetic to you as well.

Been debating with myself whether to continue this debate or not, it really doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things what you think I am or what I do.
An old bloke called Mark Twain once said that the best thing you can do with good advice is to keep it to yourself, but I cant resist passing on a little bit of wisdom, what you do with it is your call.
Over 30 years ago I was handed a little book to read, it was called "The richest man in Babylon", by George Clason.
Here's the Wiki
The Richest Man in Babylon is a book by George Samuel Clason which dispenses financial advice through a collection of parables set in ancient Babylon. Through their experiences in business and managing household finance, the characters in the parables learn simple lessons in financial wisdom. Originally, a series of separate informational pamphlets distributed by banks and insurance companies, the pamphlets were bound together and published in book form in 1926.[1]
The main take away for me was the 10% rule, been using it ever since, that's why I got into BTC 14 months ago, I'll let you work out how much BTC you could buy for $1500 back then, mostly I invest in shares and real estate and it was time to have a bit of fun.
Anyway, its been fun, see you on Redditt somewhere no doubt.
BTW, still waiting on that Gox withdrawal, something like 5 weeks now, that's why I'm a rap for Coinjar.
One more thing, send me your Email address and I'll send you a picture of my truck and seeing old mate LLoyd H.,who is 73, is off on compo, that makes me the oldest driver in the fleet (Patrick Autocare) nationwide.
Average age of drivers in the fleet is 49 FYI.

Third, yes I day trade (and night trade), amazing what you can do with an iPad and a windows laptop, sheesh, amazing that an old fart like me can manage the technology.
Never mind that I've been stuffing around with PC's since about 1984
As for BS, if I wasn't such a careless bastard I'd send you some BTC, so you could buy a box of tissues, if you knew how little I care about your opinion.
Btw, the $1500, I lied, this morning I had 3k turn up in my account.
How? Easy.
Trade BTC on Gox, LTC on BTC-e, transfer BTC to CJ and cash to your account, simple.

Happy they're  about but, when Technocash pulled the pin I thought we were going to miss out on BTC, then I got onto CoinJar and they basically saved the day. 
Still use them every week, even been accused of being a shill for them, you get that on the big jobs.
The example is still valid just the same, the day I wired Gox $150 I did a bank transfer to CoinJar, the wire took 6 days and cost me $74.00, the bank transfer took 1 day and cost me nothing.
Wiring anyone any money now is simply out of the question, BTC or nothing.

I'm just a satisfied customer, so take this with as many grains of salt as you wish.
BTC withdrawals do work, every time, never had a problem.
I use a really good exchange (Coinjar) to turn my cash in to BTC, then use the BTC to trade on BTC-e, then use Coinjar again to turn BTC into cash, the whole process can take and often does, less than 24hrs.
The one time I contacted support, my issue was resolved within 24 hrs, the reason it took that long I believe is mainly because of the time difference between Australia and their location.
I submitted the Query prior to going to bed and it was resolved in the morning, too easy.
BTC-e works for me, as it works for tens of thousands of other people.
My suggestion to the OP is simple, stop spreading FUD, get off your whining arse and start your own exchange, fully transparent of course.
Build it and they will come, except for me, I'll stick with BTC-e thank you.

I have to agree with most of your points and assumptions, however the card I use is just a standard Visa debit card issued by my local State Bank, however we're lucky enough to have an organisation here in Australia which with a few clicks of a mouse button turns Crypto into $AUD, so none of my hard earned $ are harmed in the process.
Where I disagree with you is that Crypto is a ponzi.
My father was a professional man, he got paid well and on a salary of about $60./ week was able to raise 4 kids, buy a nice house and drive a nice car.
That same $60 barely buys me a packet of smokes, it certainly doesn't fill my fuel tank.
 
Over my life time I've seen my income increase year over year but my purchase power decrease, the biggest ponzi over my lifetime has been fiat currency, these days I earn good money, but it buys me less and less.
The people who invested in Crypto aren't morons, most of them genuinely believe (correctly) that control of the financial system needs to be returned to people, not controlled by massive, profit driven, financial institutions.
Sure many invested in order to make a quick buck, a lot of people got burned due to impatience or simply got caught in the hype, I've known people that spend a fortune on lottery tickets too, same thing.
My suggestion to you is to invest a hundred GBP in someting like Bitcoin, or better still buy a hundred Crypto 20 tokens and just forget about them for a few years, life will go on, the sun will still come up and the tide will continue to ebb and flow.
Who knows, you may be pleasantly surprised, if not, what have you lost, the cost of a tank of fuel.

For a few years I lived in a society where the main store of value was pigs (still is in some communities), the alternative currencies were shells ( for the coastal people) feathers and stones (for the highlanders).
Took a long time to adopt currency as we know it, it had no value as such, the notes disintegrated rapidly when buried and the coins needed a hole in the middle so they coul be threaded on a string and worn like a necklace.
Pigs are a great store of value and a sign of great wealth, they have many uses besides tasting like a human being ( their preferred protein), they breed and multiply their value, the women breast feed the piglets to help them gain weight.
The point is, you're not interested in Crypto, fair enough, that's your choice.
I've been into Crypto since early 2014, I use it on a daily basis, it pays for fuel, bread, milk, smokes.
The shop I go to has no idea that the card I pay with is funded with Crypto, it may as well be funded with pigs or shells, makes no difference.
No doubt the rest of the world will slowly move to digital currency, whilst people like you will remain firmly rooted in stones or shells or pigs.

First of, it's really nice to have a real conversation, real debate, something that rarely happens on Reddit thank you for that.
Last point first, a pack of cigarettes costs about $38.00 for a pack of 30, the govt. In their wisdom are hiking up the price about every six months in order to curtail the filthy habit.
I'm not convinced that my standard of living is any better than my fathers, sure I can access 400 tv channels in colour as opposed to 4 in black and white, but I don't watch tv.
My dad taught me to make a crystal radio when I was 10, it sparked a life long interest in Tech., he would have been gobsmacked with today's technology, certainly the transition from analogue to digital has been nothing short of miraculous.
I invested in BTc at about $40, not to get rich, just because the Blockchain technology and it's implications fascinated me, call me an idealist, the process was time-consuming and clunky, then  I lost most of it at MtGox anyway.
That's when reality hit, there's some bad people out there, stumbled onto the silk road, that scared the crap out of me.
Got scammed a few times, lost some coin, which was wisdom for the pain, paid the price for being stupid.
My wife told me I was a total idiot for investing in obvious ponzi schemes, what would she know, she's an accountant and financial adviser.
Cashed (some) out at $1000 set up a little mining rig that mined LTC,  that paid for another 5 rigs, running on standalone Solar, they've paid for themselves and then some.
I didn't get rich by investing in Crypto, I'm well off because I worked my arse off for 40 yrs. but I do believe that the technology will benefit millions of people on a day to day basis, eventually.
I agree with you that FOMO is a prime motivating factor for most people, don't get left behind and there are some amazingly skillful people trading on those fears, people like Mr. Ponzi, Bernie Nadoff etc.
Greed is good according to Gordon Gecko.
A Lambo in every garage has replaced Hitler's VW, everything old is new again and Mr. Barnum was right, there's a sucker born every day,  fools and their money are still so easily separated.
So I'm not a trader, not an investor panicking at every turn of the market, just a humble miner, doing my bit to keep the system running, a dude named Ben if you like (that's a No Agenda Show reference, check out their podcast if you're not familiar with it.)
Just the same, invest some, HODL and forget about it, life goes on, with or without Crypto.

This won't stop at NY, would the last person dealing in Bitcoin please turn out the lights.

Sort of like in the U.S. You mean?

No mention of CloudHashing.io, so I'll mention it, scam/ponzi, take your pick.

Oh how appropriate, thank you for that.

It's just so sad that something as good as Bitcoin is getting regulated to put it out of reach to the average American.
They murdered online poker, now this.

One day there'll be a map of all the places, world wide, where Bitcoin is used and useful.
Around Ny there'll be a circle with a legend that reads something like " Abandon hope, all Ye who enter here"

Seems to me a lot of the third world is already running with Bitcoin, whilst the first world is too busy regulating it.
@_date: 2015-08-10 12:28:38
I'll third CoinJar, been using them since the start, super fast, easy service.
@_date: 2015-08-23 09:34:11
Yes, you're American, but if you took of those blinkers off and had a look around to see what the rest of the world is doing with bitcoin. You'd be amazed.
Right now I can give you $15,000,000 reasons why BTC is working, one Satoshi at a time, even in the USA

Not a contrarian, far too old to be a rebellious tech savvy teenager and been involved with Bitcoin since 2012, Hodling some, trading some., but it's only been in the last week that I've really had my eyes opened to the real power of Bitcoin.
Helping the unbanked gain access to a means of exchange and these people certainly aren't "too stupid", they're the ones that are taking this technology to levels that the conventional banking system could never conceive of, in a thousand different ways.
And it's happening right now.
@_date: 2018-03-30 23:30:51
Sorry you're wrong, been HODLing since $400, still investing $50/week, every week,  regardless.
Sold a couple at $1000, bought a new PC.
Sold a few in 2016, bought a new car(not a Lambo) for $65k
Diversified in '17, ETH, XMR, LTC.
Added C20 in '18
HODLing nicely thank you.
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:06:21
Bought in at $40.00, so naive, to the moon and all that and it crashed, HODLed to $1000 and that paid for my  LTC mining rig, so naive, they crashed too.
That rig now ticks away and mines XMR, darn it, they crashed as well.
Persistency beats resistancy, going to keep crashing till I get it right.

Never mind the web, computers were only used by academics on the ARPA net at universities and large research institutions that could afford them.
The first time I saw a hard drive, it was housed in a dust free cabinet, in a temperature controlled room attended by technicians we were not allowed to talk to, they were "special"
We had to get suited up and wear static bracelets just to get near it and we were told to take a good look " because you'll never see one again"
That was in 1977, 7 years later I was on line, (BBS) with a 2400 Baud modem and  Wyse 286 with a 20mb HDD that cost $6000.
RAM was $200 per Mb.
Aaaah, the good old days.

I'd be happy to pay Mark the same price for my coins that I paid for them initially before he so carelessly lost on me, just to get them back.
@_date: 2018-04-15 21:36:10
Exactly, then again, knowing how useful BTc has been for me over the last 5 yrs I just shrug and smirk.
Don't need it to go to 1million.
There's those that make it happen,
Those that watch it happen,
Those that wonder what just happened.

You obviously weren't alive before the internet or the advent of mobile phones.
Either of those things seemed delusional as well.

60 year old Interstate Truck driver, sorry to prick your bubble Old mate.
Been doing really well with BTC but I needed a facility where I can deposit and withdraw seamlessly, without losing money in the process.
CoinJar does the job for me.
Get paid good money where I work, in excess of $120k per year, but I'm averaging $1500/week out of CoinJar, so your PR job, stick it up your clacker, I can't afford the pay cut.
Have a happy and prosperous new year.
@_date: 2013-12-07 11:55:28
How about lots of people who have made several 100k, got any idea idea how life changing that is?

Went totally off grid electricity wise about 14 months ago, the money I didn't pay the electricity company I invested in BTC.
Tomorrow I pickup the next lot of Solar panels and batteries to complete the system, meaning I won't have to run a generator at all over winter.
BTC contributing to the environment, at whatever price they are, works for me.
@_date: 2013-12-29 09:56:55
My .005 BTC, I use Coinjar simply because it works, not acquainted with the Coinjar team, have no shares in Coinjar, (wish I did) just a very happy, satisfied customer.
2 Examples if I may,
I funded MtGox out of my bank account, $AUD 150, by the time it hit my account at Gox, about 10 days later, it had dwindled to something like $AUD 76.70
The same day I funded Coinjar $AUD150, it was in my account within 24 hrs, $150 Aussie Dollars.
On the 27th of November I withdrew 1k from Gox, still patiently waiting for the funds to hit my account, even opened a support ticket a week ago, no reply your worship.
I've made multiple withdrawals from Coinjar, every time the money hit my account in less than 48 hrs, that's real Aussie Dollars.
Do a bit of investigating before you sling shit at Zhou, as far as I'm concerned he's straight up and down and yes, I would and do trust him with my money.
These guys are doing a great job for Bitcoin in Australia, I hope they get filthy rich in the process and spread the wealth, (currently no trading fees on CJ)
Take all this with as many grains of salt as you wish, I'm an unabashed, unashamed, total fanboy of CoinJar and I hope the heck you support these guys.

Pardon me, but I detect a certain amount of condescension in your remark, not unexpected from some smartarse millennial I guess.
You're the beneficiary of a legacy of technology created by people going back to Marconi and Edison, Shockley,Bardeen and Brattain, Ray Dalby and Doctor Bose, mostly people that are very old or extremely dead.
It would take too long to list all the technology's created by people that are old or dead now for you to read this post on you iPad.
You see further because you are standing on the shoulders of giants.
My gut feeling is that you have contributed little or nothing to technology, you barely know where the "on" button is, you're still young, that's your fault, there's so much you have to go through (apologies to Cat Stevens)
Btw, in my little office there's a brand new PC with 2xAMD 9790's mining LTC, a Windows 8 laptop, an Android Tab that I use for playing online Poker, an IPhone 5, an iPad and lots of other technology, being 60 I can afford all the latest toys and have the time to play with them.

Following a bit of successful trading I managed to turn some BTC into another 5 x 250w Solar Panels and 4 x 6v 580 ah batteries.
Been on standalone Solar for about 14 months now and thanks to Bitcoin, I've just added about 50% capacity to the system.
BTC working for the environment.... Works for me.

No way Jose, in it for the looooong run, have 3 wallets, one for saving, one for spending and one for speculating and many buy/sell orders @ Gox.

Bitcoin was moving along PRIOR to the Chinese getting involved, every time there's lots of negatives like Silk Road , hacks, thefts etc. Bitcoin just shrugs and keeps going.
The Chinese situation is just another bump on a very rocky road.

Smile at all the naysayers, treat with disdain all the pseudo tech and financial experts, BTC is here to stay, simple really.
