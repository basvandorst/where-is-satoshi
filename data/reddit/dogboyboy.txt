I don't see how futures trading is good for bitcoin. It hasn't been since they started.

Good luck getting through to support team. I have since been unlocked but with out any explanation or reason from them. Coinbase support is literally the worst. How long have you been locked out?

No, its not when you mine it, its when you sell it. You need to get a new tax guy if you think that that is the case.

You need a job to earn that. Two jobs actually. And full-time jobs too. Consider that other peoples experience might be different from yours.

I like Supreme gear a lot. It lets me know someone is a total douche bag with out ever having to speak to them.
@_date: 2019-04-18 14:41:26

What if I put my coin into cold storage before the fork? Does it still become two coins?

Not sure who is the bad guy here...
@_date: 2017-07-31 20:39:06
What do you use to buy/sell these days if you don't mind my asking?
@_date: 2017-07-31 21:05:37
Why do you ask?
@_date: 2017-07-26 22:15:09
I've been locked out for 2 weeks as well. File a complaint with CFTB, pretty much start doing what [this guy]( did.
@_date: 2017-07-20 21:06:00
@_date: 2017-07-31 21:34:52
Not sure if I'm verified, yes over 18.
@_date: 2017-07-26 22:16:26
How about my case? I've been waiting two weeks with zero information from you guys.
