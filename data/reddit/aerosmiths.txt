i was thinking actually, that a better cryptocurrency would have some code in it to destroy the first few coins that were mined with the least difficulty. or a code that gives weight to coins based on their difficulty when it was mined. that way, first few miners could not abuse the system.

true, but once all 21 million btc is mined, his impact will no more lessen. and who is to say he would not be dumping and pumping in order to amass more btc.

another question, if we had many exchanges, does it somehow make it more decentralized.

actually, i have another theory:
as long as people hoard on to their bitcoins, thus restricting the movement of bitcoins in the system, the system will slowly become less attractive to newcomers and this stabilizes bitcoin prices. as prices stabilizes over a long period of time (months, maybe years or centuries till this hoarders cash out), these hoarders eventually become inpatient and cashes out to reap their rewards, which causes a dip, or maybe even a crash but in the grand scheme, causes more bitcoins to be available for the economy, and thus make bitcoin successful. in other words, the "invisible hand" will automatically balance out.
so bitcoins, just like the real economy now, will inevitably require market crashes in oder to transit to another era of greater growth.

that is why i am worrying now.

anyone can give a quick update?

i understand your point, but at the very least, governments are subjected to the people (via votes or protests or revolution) and they are made up of groups of people.

my point is that when bitcoin succeeds, there would be no need to sell bitcoins for usd or any other thing. he would be the richest entity on this planet.

and a side inquiry.
is it really confirmed that a singular person (satoshi or whoever) really has 1 million btc?

what does dupe means?
