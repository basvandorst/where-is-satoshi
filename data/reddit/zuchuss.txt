i did a lot of options and margin trading on tech stocks and i think you're right. for bitcoin to be hitting 500k+ in the coming times the amount of cash flow would have to be huge. 
50% loss if wrong seems big though i think a tighter stop is warranted. i dont know how much fishing for stops happens though to be honest. i just look at the daily chart with bb, macd, rsi, sometimes stochastic rsi. best traders i know relied heavily on rsi

well the initial rally was looking good but the bears are winning right now. looks like today will maintain its blood bath status and tomorrow might see some more panic selling until way oversold conditions then look for the hammer on the daily as a first entry. 
if no hammer then we'll see some serious support tests im sure. support is pretty good around 13300ish now and thats where the fight has taken to once again.

not cost effective at all, you didn't need an industrial vat or expensive pump or special fluid for this. lmao
put it in a fuckin kiddy pool with mineral oil and a cheapo pump... might even just put in a sump pump to avoid any cutting or piping.  
all this shows is you wasted 20k

Yeah and you don't have drip loops in any of the cabling running from or around the vat. Overall just an unnecessary and expensive setup.
