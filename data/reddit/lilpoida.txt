It’s insurance for miners. If the price of bitcoin goes down they lose money. If they take the short position on a calculated percentage of their bitcoin worth they can still profit if the price of bitcoin falls and continue affording to mine.

Because as more people are born and more resources are created the value of bitcoin will rise as there is demand and regular people will actually be able to save with their deflationary currency instead of putting their money in a bank that makes money fo you (at the expense of other people losing money).

Not everyone lives in America, in my country it is extremely difficult to get a mortgage as a single person unless you earn over $100,000 USD / year and have a 20% deposit.

I had a bitcoin debit card that got shut down because I don’t live in Europe. Is yours European?

I think you’re underestimating how hard it is to get a mortgage these days and also assuming a lot about someone you’ve never met. If you have enough bitcoin to buy a house you definitely have enough to retire on, considering the deflation is so rapid that you could spend some coin on rent and still end up with increased wealth at the end of each month... in 10 years we could all be spending as little as 0.00001btc each month on rent!

Would they not be paying a fee every time they move the coin between addresses...? So what is the point in spam if you’re just going to run out of money?

You can’t just “get a mortgage” if you don’t have an income, or cash sitting in the bank.
