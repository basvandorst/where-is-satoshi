Interesting findings. When I was researching this for my dissertation and looking at data before 2018 it seemed that the usage of Bitcoin for real world transactions was declining with all the growth coming from speculation. Maybe the reason we are seeing this trend reverse now is that the news coverage brought about by the 2017 bubble caused more awareness of Bitcoin as a payment system. Now the transaction fees are more afforable it has actually become more practical to use Bitcoin.

That is what we need. It needs to be able to replace all payments for it to be useable as a currency. A currency is no good if it can be only used for items of high value.

One of the issues was a lack of a Bitcoin sentiment index. I used the Bitcoin fear and greed index by alternative.me however this was not optimal as it included data that was not related to my hypothesis. Although it is a good index and I’m glad someone is taking the time to make it available for free.
There is a Bitcoin Sentiment index created by Thompson Reuters however to gain access to it you need to pay $10 000+. I have therefore decided to create my own Bitcoin Sentiment index available to everyone for free. It will be available on my site crypto-emotion.com. If you want to be notified when it is first released please sign up to be notified on my site Crypto-emotion.com.

That is the current biggest issue facing Bitcoin. It’s not an engineering issue as there are many alt-coins that have addressed it, as well as the lightening network. We just need to wait for these solutions to become more mainstream.
