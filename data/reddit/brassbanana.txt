Completely agree. TA is an educated guess. We have tools to predict movements. It's impossible to be right 100% of the time and a monkey can be right 50% of the time but to be right over 75% of the time isn't just down to luck. 
@_date: 2018-01-15 19:45:38
Because those guys suck at trading and their only argument is TA doesn't work. 
I look at it this way. Trading is educated gambling. Someone new could play poker and get lucky and win a couple times but eventually they will start losing overall. But if you play enough times and learn and educate yourself, you can get really good and win a lot. But even really good players have bad games from time to time.

Nah you're wrong. Hashrate will drop, difficulty adjusts and bitcoin keeps going.

Yeah it is a lot larger, by a factor of 10. We really won't know until there's a true bear market but by then it'll already be well into the bear market.

haha you can't go wrong with it.
@_date: 2018-01-18 02:21:22
There's two ways I could see this happen. It'll either go up and stagnate and eventually break 20k or it'll go up and stagnate and slowly bleed out until it hits a new low. Don't get me wrong, I would like this to go to make a new ath. Just don't know if the money is there yet. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 01:37:46
You and I both don't know that. You might be right and it could stagnate. But I could be right and it will form a bull trap. I have a plan and will stick to it. But my buy at 9300 was not stupid considering it is up almost 2k right now. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:28:51
Your charts are pure numbers and data so must be fraud /s
Don't worry about that guy. I get your point and it's bang on. The guy arguing is cherry picking the 2013 crash just like you're picking the one in Jan 2017
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:36:14
You're one of the few I agree with. Everyone here is scared and watching it drop. So what if it goes to 8k? It'll be well above the current price within a week. Everyone always tries to pick bottom and then when they're watching it, and it does hit bottom and runs up, they think it has lower to go when it doesn't.  
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:56:06
Why? You know nothing about Op's person life. As far as we know Op could already be a multimillionaire. He said he owns a profitable business. When bitcoin was below $200 in 2014 none of us could have predicted it would hit $20k. Fact is most of us were even debating about putting any money into it.   
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:48:52
This is the same attitude that causes greed. Humanity in general wants money because of what it can buy for us or its purchasing power. If you want money just to see how big of a number you can get in your bank account then that is greed.

You're right. Those stop losses are important and knowing when you've made a bad trade too. You got downvoted because most people suck at trading and don't like those that can. Patience and some solid trading rules will put you miles ahead than hodling.

Haha big difference between throwing your money away and trading strategically. Imo there are only 3 coins ever worth investing in.
That being said, I do feel sorry for all the guys that got caught up in that scam.
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:15:09
Sorry I should've been clearer. I don't think we will see a new ATH this year and then later this year, possibly in the summer, it'll hit lower than it is now. But right now I think there is a huge trading opportunity to buy and sell much higher in a few weeks. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 02:11:46
Hahah your trolling deserves a B. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 19:41:58
Good thing you didn't. $200 just felt too high. Anytime is a good time now though imo. To back that up I went 100% back in Ltc holdings at $140.
Without shilling the coin but to answer your question. Ltc has a great track record, no premine with a fair launch. Good devs, community and Charlee is great and means well. It has a solid dev plan. Low fees, fast transfers and has all the new developments that btc has except sooner. It's accepted on every exchange and more merchants are starting to accept it. It's better for trading because the swings are more extreme but follow btc closely leading to bigger returns. I've also been involved with it for over 4 years and can't let it go either haha. I really think Ltc is a top tier coin only pushed down because of a lot of non mineable, high supply, spam coins or forked coins that are not really serving any purpose.           
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:15:24
When the last guy has sold and everyone who has sold is waiting for it to drop more, it won't. FOMO will push this up fast. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:27:48
Serious question... how can you tell the difference between the actual bottom and what looks to be bottom but gets crushed through 2 hours later? They both look the same until one is already up 10% while the other drops down lower. 
For the record, I bought what I think is bottom. But for someone else that drop to 10k yesterday also could've been the bottom.
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:51:22
I'll give my 2 satoshi's here. From Nov 2015 to Mar 2017 there was a very prominent support line the price did not fall below. It was the support line that held multiple drops and stagnation periods. It held from $250 to $1k and that is really when the price started to rise upwards on a log scale. Extrapolate that line to today and we've got support around $2k. 
I don't believe we will hit $2k ever again however baring some catastrophic event, $5k though is possible imo. Whether we are entering another long bear market is tough to say. 2014 and 2015 was brutal and would be hard to wait something like that out again. Keep in mind that nobody thought btc was headed to $200 when it was at $900. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:45:18
Actually agree with you. I think 5k eventually but not before a short term bull run. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:11:26
You're right in everything you said. Nothing about the run to 20k made any sense at all, it was all euphoric. My question was more rhetorical in how do you know what the bottom is compared to a temporary low that becomes a top later? 
$9200 might just be the absolute low and if you are wishing on 6k, it may never come. When the price goes back to 13k you already missed it.  
@_date: 2018-01-17 18:04:21
Yup this is the better answer to what you said. If you look at where it was at in the past year, what it has done in the past couple days, and where it'll be in the next few weeks, you won't care what it does tomorrow. 
Edit: Btw that hodl mentality, as stupid as it is, leads to some damn good returns.

@_date: 2018-01-17 17:40:27
Been trading crypto for years. When it is down over 30% in a day or two, you buy. If you don't buy then you'll just be chasing it back up much higher waiting for a drop that doesn't come.

You got downvoted for giving your opinion. It's sad that if you say anything bad about BTC in this subreddit you are considered a shill. LTC can handle 4x the transactions in 10 min and confirmations at 4x the speed. It is a superior option to BTC but doesn't have first mover advantage. I love BTC but LTC is better in every way. LN network can solve a tonne of issues but it's clearly going to take time before there's widespread adoption. There's a lot of options out there that will work instead of BTC.

@_date: 2017-11-04 00:56:27
How can you be certain of this? I want bitcoin to succeed just as much as the next guy but it is plausible that bitcoin may never break through 10k ever. It could drop to 1k too or fizzle out all together. 
If you are investing in bitcoin you have to be rational about what you are investing in and understand there are significant risks. The op you mentioned is very level headed and realistic. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 03:34:49
Manipulation? Are you kidding me? Bitcoin is up 20% in a week. This is profit taking after a massive run up. Demand and momentum have been dropping for the last two days. If you call a $400 drop manipulation then you have to call a $1600 rise in a week manipulation too.  
@_date: 2017-11-09 04:54:08
This is where I think LTC has far more utility for cash/spending than BCH. LTC is far less centralized than BCH. Atomic swaps with ltc/btc is a very simple possibility.    
@_date: 2017-11-03 19:59:35
Exactly! The insane price predictions, constant memes, shills arguing that bitcoin isn't going to drop combined with the massive fuck up that the fork will cause has convinced me that, for the first time in a long time, to consider selling bitcoin. Everyone wants the free coins and everyone plans to sell when the fork happens. I think do what everyone isn't doing.    
@_date: 2017-11-02 18:32:48
Are you claiming an asset that has risen 700% in a year is low risk or bitcoin in general? While bitcoin has matured a lot over the last few years it is still very high risk. It's an unregulated market, thinly traded, and you can lose a lot of money very fast.

This is a great analogy and I couldn't agree with you more. We would be having a very different conversation if bitcoin was at 500 right now. The "what a smart move" crowd would be the "what an idiot for gambling his money away" crowd. "If" 7500 is top and this crashes then a lot of people are going to look stupid for not selling but "if" it goes up a lot more everyone looks smart. Bitcoin is akin to an educated gamble.

Price is at a point now where those that bought at 5k have seen a huge return and want to realize some profits. Price has risen fast and nothing wrong with taking profits. Bcash will never catch on with a leader like Roger saying it is 'his' project.

This isn't Coinbase at fault at all, it's a product of the system. Anything over a 10k single transaction has to be reported to AML regulators in US or Canada. This is why they require further verification for more than 10k withdrawals. It's also illegal to purposely withdraw multiple transactions under 10k to avoid being reported. Hence why OP couldn't withdraw more than 50k without verification.

Noticed this too. Nobody is talking about the fact that the hashrate is about to drop 80% and blocktimes will drop from 6 blocks/hr to 1.2 blocks/hr ave until difficulty can adjust. Granted if the price of 2x stays low then the block reward will stay low and miners will be forced to switch to 1x to turn a profit. And then what if miners have saved a tonne of bitcoin so they can crush the 1x price and boost the 2x price. Users will follow the money. It's going to be one hell of a shitstorm.   
@_date: 2017-11-01 03:00:32
Yeah most governments can manage inflation effectively. The usd, yen, euro etc are all very stable and inflation is kept in check. 
A recurring theme among crypto enthusiasts is that due to the debt the US government has the gov will be forced into borrowing more money and subsequent printing of said money to finance and pay the interest on that debt leading to hyperinflation. This is what lead to the post in the first place. I'm not advocating any side to this rather it is something I've seen advocated heavily among bitcoin enthusiasts. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 23:54:27

This is the course of an argument between a big blocker and a 2nd layer scaling solution advocate. Big blockers cannot answer the original question you asked. 
You are right 100%. 8mb is fine and those that want a node can still support it but it is kicking the can further down the road. When blocks clog up again we have to either increase block size again or go to 2nd layer scaling. It makes complete sense now to start developing 2nd layer scaling solutions. 
The bcash crowd want a decentralized cash system in Satoshi's version yet big blocks create a completely centralized system. It's completely hypocritical. If we want to have a decentralized system bitcoin has to scale. It is also completely unrealistic to think that internet speeds worldwide, while increasing, can keep up with the log growth of bitcoin.

Your math isn't wrong, the reasoning is. A 75% crash absolutely matters and it really doesn't matter what number it crashes from except for you directly. 
If you bought 5k, btc hits 25k and drops to 6250, great, you are still up 25% on your investment if you haven't sold. But a crash from 10k to 2500 and you're down 50%.

Never said that at all. Been in this space for 4 years and we are all aware of the risks. But you need people having 21 btc on an exchange to trade/sell to keep the economy going. If everyone followed the rule of keeping all coins off an exchange there would be no coins for you and I to buy. Now what exchange you use without due diligence is another story although history has shown trust != safe. But if you plan on holding only then coins should be in a wallet you control.

Those 19k were worth a lot but a lot less when stamp was hacked compared to now. And if the person who stole the btc from stamp can only cash out on locabitcoins, wouldn't you try selling them far below market price? Both parties win when the buyers pay far below market price and the seller gets 2m instead of 3m. The buyer has more incentive to not tell authorities when they get a good deal.

Buy with the expectation that you may never see that money ever again. If you can stomach that and it won't hurt you financially at all then go ahead and buy.
My opinion is taking a loan to buy bitcoin is risky. If you're holding for years then you will probably see a return eventually. But there is no telling if we have just seen the start to a bear market or if this is just a correction before a new ATH. How would you feel if you didn't buy and it went up 50% versus if you did buy and it dropped 50%? 
@_date: 2017-09-15 20:54:17
1. Any users that were in fiat when the site went down were given 55% of their funds. Most likely some users are buying btc, ltc, eth at a premium to withdraw the rest of their funds.
2. See answer 1.
3. Each token represents the equivalent amount of coins owing. When Bitfinex was hacked users were unsure whether they were going to be paid back so the tokens have a lower value than the currency they represent. Btc-e is using the same method of reimbursement. Some users are willing to risk buying the tokens for cheap in the hopes that btc-e will make good on their promise to reimburse their tokens. If you buy tokens for half their value and you get paid back in full, you know have 2x as many coins.  
@_date: 2018-02-09 04:42:58

Would have to agree. Traded all through that drop in 2014 also. I remember that crash from $320 to $160 very well. It happened in 2 weeks, with a 100% loss! This drop is peanuts compared to previous drops. This one recently is only 25%. But a 100% loss could be in the future too from the ATH. Can't wait to find out!
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:39:56
You know what. This subreddit, while having a lot more new investors than I've ever seen, has the EXACT same sentiment as the April and Nov 13 bubbles. Everyone is screaming this time is different, this time it's the end, there won't be any more bubbles. And there's always that doubt. 
Nobody thought bitcoin would ever recover from $1200 in Nov 13. And I mean nobody. After the Gox collapse everyone, myself included, thought this could really be done for. It took 2 damn years and a painful bear market but look where we are at.
If we aren't at the bottom of this collapse then we are damn close. Just look at how everyone is reacting. It could drop much further but you are absolutely right, we will have another bubble. Maybe not for a couple years at the least and it might not be as high, but it will happen..  
@_date: 2017-09-09 03:57:58
I really hope you're right and LTC goes up too. I also think there's a real possibility that it could drop further before a lengthy consolidation. It's up 20x in the past 6 months! Those are unreal gains. At what point does the bull run stop and bears take over for a while?   
Edit: BTC is also up 8x in the last year. When BTC ends so does all other coins.

Btc-e was hacked a long time ago, repaid everyone. They got shutdown by the US feds, came back online, and more than likely will repay everyone. Knowing who owns an exchange != trust. Mtgox, stamp, bitfinex all got hacked. Anyone can look up who owns them. 
They announced their new site on their official twitter. It's a trusted source. I tried the wrong password, did not work. My funds are there exactly as they were left. This is not a phishing site.

Don't assume you're safe with a 50% drop. Bitcoin could easily drop to $1000 again or even lower and take years to recover. Nobody here wants it to happen but it still could happen. This is why if you plan on buying with your funds/loans, assume that money gone.

Agreed. There are a lot of people asking questions on this subreddit that have bought recently and don't understand bitcoin at all. Bitcoin is not ready for the mainstream.

Main language is Russian but not sure where they are based out of (it wasn't Russia before). They were taken down by US Authorities a month and a half ago and most people wrote them off as gone. They've somehow come back despite their website being down at btc-e.com. They trade worldwide except in China now.     
@_date: 2017-09-16 04:29:58
Ha yeah you're right. It's a clear warning that if you're using the site and from the US and you lose your funds, you are screwed. I imagine support won't help you at all. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 21:57:31
Think of this as sort of similar to Mt.Gox going down. On the last day Btc at Gox was trading as low as $100 while Bitfinex never was lower than $400. In any Chinese exchange, users can either withdraw their coins or fiat. Most users won't be adding fiat anymore so if you want your fiat out you will have to sell at a discount. Those users still buying are willing to buy coins at a discount but will not be able to sell them for fiat to withdraw anytime soon.  
@_date: 2017-10-15 20:57:38
The fee is shown when you go to withdraw from your wallet. You have an option with wallets, where you control the private keys, to manually enter the fee. If withdrawing from an exchange, most exchanges have a set fee for any transaction. 
If you want to manually change the fee then go to a block explorer and check out what fee most users are paying.

Not sure why everyone is hating on you. Before the NYA was thought up everyone around this sub was saying we need bigger blocks. Now that it's happening this sub has turned very anti big-block. It's clear there is a split but the users will decide the fate of bitcoin. 
84% of miners right now are signalling 2x. If majority of users don't want 2x then nobody will use that chain, price falls and miners will be forced to switch back to the legacy chain as it won't be profitable to mine. 
Correct me if I'm wrong but if those 16% mining the legacy chain remain, it would be much easier to control 50% of the blocks and an attack is a real concern. There is no financial incentive for it but it is possible. The price of 2x would have to drop enough to force miners to mine the legacy chain. However, if the legacy btc price stays high and while difficult adjusts, it could become extremely profitable to mine the legacy chain. Either way things are going to get very interesting.

@_date: 2017-10-31 00:13:46
That's what makes it worse if even possible. If you know the address you can see the 150 btc sitting in it but with no key to access it, it's entirely useless. Like having 90k behind some glass, it's yours, and you can never have it, it's just sitting there taunting you.

Most alts follow bitcoins movements somewhat. LTC was coupled with bitcoin for a very long time at one point. Looks like LTC and ETH have both coupled. They'll break away eventually someday.

Check out Zimbabwe currency for a lesson on unlimited supply and hyperinflation. It destroys an entire economy. Deflation is interesting in that it encourages savings and realy is horrible for an economy to go round. 
I like bitcoin and have invested in it but we have never really seen a truly deflationary currency on a large scale. The hoarding of bitcoin is why the price is so high. Will be cool to see what happens in a few years. Could crash and burn or could turn out great but the economic experiment is what history is made of. 
@_date: 2017-09-08 04:51:19
Saving should be encouraged but people also have to spend. Saving doesn't make the economy go around, spending does. It's economics 101. Few people use bitcoin to buy goods. A system built on saving isn't good for society as an economy but could be argued is good for society as an individual. Whether Bitcoin enables a sound economic system is tough to say just yet if nobody wants to spend.

Use QuadrigaCX in Canada. Highly recommended and they have good liquidity. Verification is required and takes about 3 days. You can then wire the money (they don't charge a fee but the bank will) to the exchange to buy 2-3 bitcoin at once. Interact is instant but has a limit of $2000/day and they charge a fee. The trading fee is 0.5% to buy and sell bitcoin.   
Coinbase is alright. You can buy instantly but there's a limit. You can only deposit as a Canadian and cannot withdraw fiat. If you choose Coinbase, deposit to Coinbase and use GDAX to buy as the fees are a lot lower. Coinbase fees are 4% and GDAX are 0.25%. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 20:01:01
You're right. There will come a point where you don't need to understand how bitcoin works, just as long as it does work. Wallets and the like are still too technical for your average joe. There will be a breakthrough moment but we haven't seen it yet.    
@_date: 2017-09-23 18:15:54
None. There is no reason, it already went down below 3k anyways. He says moving averages are coincidence but elliott wave pattern has to be followed. I like looking at chart ideas for interest sake and for every person that is right there are 10 people that are wrong. Someone is bound to be right. There are clear trends however but picking targets and the right direction isn't possible.

Did you even look at that article? All those corrections you're talking of were far more than 20%. April 2013 for example was a high of $260 followed by a crash to $45. It found stability around $90. Every drop we've seen this year has been a correction and not a crash. When it crashes and the bubble bursts you'll know. 
Nov 2013 was a bubble. Plain and simple. Mtgox didn't make the recovery any easier. Anyone I know didn't use or go through mtgox to buy bitcoin that year because the writing was on the wall well in advance that you should not use mtgox. You know what caused the crash, the US senate hearing. It wasn't mtgox, they imploded later on. They just made it worse. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 23:19:45
The same back in 2012. Saw it back then and only watched from the sidelines. Finally invested in 2013 and did alright but the bear market was long. Didn't want to miss out on the next bull run so said fuck it and went half savings into btc. Took that and while ltc was staying stagnant went all in on on ltc. Best decision I could've made. Anyways, it's never too late to buy. 
@_date: 2017-09-16 04:43:22
I suppose you could question their legality but I'm going off of the ToS and previous posts. Take it for what you will. 
@_date: 2017-09-09 04:28:44
I agree but it still is only pointing up until it isn't. $100 would be great, is it coming before the end of the year or in a year or two? I know it's pessimistic. When I take a step back and look at the 2 year charts it looks insane. All the new development will definitely give it a boost though.  
@_date: 2017-10-31 17:16:30
You're right and more bitcoins can be added. It would require a hardfork and consensus. It would devalue everyone's bitcoin and there is no incentive for it at all. The users would decide which bitcoin chain to use. You can't create more out of thin air on the current bitcoin chain as it is. 
Fun fact: bitcoin has been forked hundreds of times and you and I can fork it as well. This is the same as taking the US dollar and making two versions of it but using all the old ones as well. Nobody would want that and everyone would only choose one to use. Decentralized currency is an interesting concept.

Yeah buy bitcoin using GDAX and pay less fees. Coinbase and gdax are one in the same and both wallets are insured. It doesn't matter which you use to hold your coins but if you plan on buying or selling then stick with gdax. Transferring funds info is [here](

Zimbabwe is a great example. It happened and had real consequences for real people. Plenty of currencies have suffered from hyperinflation throughout history. Supply of course doesn't go to infinity. It's not sustainable and things fall apart. 
The key word here is a proper central bank. When everything is running properly there are never any problems.

Said this same thing a few weeks ago and had a lot of angry messages sent my way. Not many people like hearing it but there are a lot of people that will lose a lot of money when the current bubble bursts. 
With more users we're going to get more of the good and the bad. Most people will dwell on the quality shitposts than the quality discussions.

Zoom out on the chart. Price has climbed from $600 to $6000 in 10 months. Is that healthy and real growth or a lot of get-rich-quick money?
@_date: 2017-09-15 21:45:26
No idea how long it will take them to reimburse the tokens. It will depend on the trade volume. They lost 45% of funds, it's significant and could take years to repay.

A few months ago a bunch of big names in Bitcoin, most importantly the miners, got together and signed this thing called the New York Agreement. They agreed two things.
1. Segwit would be activated and;
2. Increase the blocksize from 1mb to 2mb 
Segwit was activated recently in the first step. In November the blocksize is supposed to increase. Miners have to support the increase but there are reportedly several things wrong (debatable?) with the blocksize increase. So now some of those companies and miners that signed the agreement are backing out of the agreement to increase the blocksize while others will still support it. There could be two Bitcoins, one becoming an alt coin and one becoming the main chain. But they could also coexist together. We want this to be resolved soon or this could become a far bigger issue than anything else to date.

Just below this convo I posted a link about the bitcoin bubbles.  There were bubbles and extended bear markets. April 2013 was a short bubble and nov 2013 was a long bubble. 2014 was the worst bear market and the effects of a massive bubble. But if you're going to look at bitcoin from the genesis block then one could argue bitcoin is just one big massive bubble that's going to burst. I don't agree with this though as there is healthy growth and also irrational growth like we are seeing now. It honestly feels no different than any other bubble I've been a part of. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 16:41:13
Dude, when you start throwing out insults the convo is over and there's no point in having a discussion anymore. We don't agree about it, that's alright. The sooner you learn to have a civil discussion the more respect you'll garner.

[Bitcoin bubbles]( 
If you're looking for a bubble like the stock or dotcom bubble that lasted a few years then no we haven't had that. But a short 10x increase in price followed by a long 90% drop in price is a bubble. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 05:37:14
Why should this time be any different than any previous bitcoin bubble? Panic buying and panic selling hold true at any moment. It's in a bull market now but there will be an extended bear market at some point. Nobody knows when but it will happen and bitcoin will recover and make a new ATH again. And the cycle continues...

Best advice is keep it in cold storage. You could trade but most aren't successful at it. You can gain interest by margin funding on an exchange but you would have to move your coins onto an exchange and keep them there.   
@_date: 2017-10-15 18:47:32
They are bubbles in a sense of the mania and subsequent crash that followed. What you described is exactly what happened in any other massive price increase. We've seen a lot of corrections this year but no crash. 
Yeah I think you're right. If you look at the posts back in '13 when the price was $1k everyone said it will be $5k soon. We are seeing that irrational exuberance again. But bubbles can be irrational longer than you can be rational. 
It's not sustainable but the question is until when? I think we are a long ways from bitcoin going mainstream because it really isn't easy to use. So right now the average investor is buying for big returns because they hear about huge returns from a friend or from the media. So we are moving to a irrational stage where a true crash is becoming more likely.                              
@_date: 2017-10-27 06:05:10
I agree with you that this sub has grown too big to have much for technical discussions. Really miss the days in late 14/early 15 when it wasn't about the value of btc. It really has been a roller coaster though. 
If bitcoin is going mainstream then it is at the very very early stages. I have and continue to believe that there are a lot of get-rich-quick people buying bitcoin right now that have made it ripe for a huge crash and subsequent long-term correction. Right now for new users it's buy and ask questions after. And often these are people who are overly invested.

TA isn’t necessarily about making a prediction about direction with 100% certainty. It’s impossible to know that. TA is using the information you have to predict odds of something happening and having plans if that does or doesn’t work out. Stop orders are highly important. Speaking from persons experience I have a far bigger return from trading than if I ever held.
