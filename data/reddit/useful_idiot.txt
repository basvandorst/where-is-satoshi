Then what would separate us from the traditional big banks? We are on the verge of something truly amazing, if we turn back now, all the forward momentum behind bitcoin will be for naught. This is time for bitcoin to shine!

Its all just re-branded hardware? All of their servers are blatantly supermicro hardware.

I can whole heartedly recommend Microtronix: 
Been using them for over a year now.

Canada computers had a 5870 for 259 - 70$ MIR - employee discount. Now they are getting harder to find but you can still scope good deals.
@_date: 2011-06-03 21:29:13
ATI hands down. If you plan on running mass video cards and multiple systems, you can get radeon 5830's for about 120$, and they produce about 240Mhash/s. However if you only want one or two miner rigs, go for something more powerful. I picked up a 5870 yesterday for 240$ with a 70$ rebate and i am getting about 365Mhash/s.
avoid nvidia if you are even remotely serious about mining.

Easy there, Kramer.

This lesson hasn't been learned, how many people still use mtgox?
@_date: 2011-06-23 14:24:11
I think I have found a decent middle ground. I keep my keepass database stored on my own server at home, accessible via https. Anywhere I go I can easily access a portable version of keepass. I also keep a spare copy of my password database on my phone  in the rare event my server goes down.
@_date: 2011-08-26 18:06:04
Just bought a radeon 6990 with bitcoins when they were valued at 13$, glad I purchased when i did!

jeez its almost worth the super costly hdd recovery at this price
@_date: 2011-06-23 14:31:48
I am pretty sure you only need one version of wallet.dat; It wont change throughout the lifetime of your wallet, hence no reason to version control it.
@_date: 2011-08-02 15:03:19
I love how the mtgox guys played right into it and look like fucking retards.
@_date: 2011-06-03 21:31:03
I have a farm of CPU based miners that earn about 0.01 to 0.02 btc every night, its not even worth maintaining any more, and these are Core2 and Xeon systems. Lets just say it is not worth your while unless your intention is to solo mine with them and hope for the snowballs chance in hell that you find a block, statistically that is VERY unlikely.
@_date: 2011-08-29 15:37:37
Your heart is in the right place, but this will ultimately be bad for bitcoin and minethings. There is a steep learning curve with bitcoin, and a wait time to transfer in/out of all the major exchanges.

Yes, download the ati stream sdk here:

If you look hard enough you can find good deals. For 950$ CAD i just got 2 5970's with waterblocks already installed.

No. Especially with a laptop that cannot stand running at 100% utilization for long periods of time. You are also forgetting that a single gpu can produce upwards for 400 million hashes per second.

Damn a few months ago I bought Portal2 for 55BTC. Meh, its still worth 550$ to me it was that good.

All the more reason to not keep your savings wallet mounted and accessible all the time. its a PITA but so its losing all of your bitcoins.

No, running your bitcoin processing backend on the same server/network as your web frontend is asking for trouble.

Props to you guys for dealing with this bs and persevering, you run an awesome business and are great to deal with! May this serve as another reminder to the community as to how important bitcoin really is.

For maintenance so it could make even more money afterwards? Given such a successful market position they are in, I would be polishing that bitch night and day making sure it runs smooth as a babies arse.

Hey this looks great. A couple questions... Are multiple IPs available? Does you block any ports? Can I run my  own mail server(not an open smtp relay). Does OpenVPN work with xen?

Ingram Micro has a huge warehouse in Mississauga that I have used quite often, shipping from there would be pure win.

Just a heads up if anyone wants to exchange cash for BTC in the GTA give me a shout :), I am willing to go with mtgox prices instead of cavirtex.

Just a note to everyone complaining about losing money due to delays in the blockchain (most likely because of SDice). If you invested early in BTC without knowing that this was a possibility or didnt keep up with the technical details, your investment was in blind faith / speculation, and you got everything you deserve from such an investment. Furthermore, claiming quick solutions like blocking SDice transactions to restore the status quo(and there are patches that do this!!) is detrimental to the bitcoin community, your investment, and directly violates the fundamental principles of why bitcoin was created.
The next few weeks/months will be very interesting from a technical perspective to see how the blockchain evolves (and the associated price speculation that follows).

Any ETA for those of us who placed orders earlier this week? I have an order that has been "processing" since Monday morning.

Even if my coins or order is lost, it's the silent treatment that is what I'm really disappointed about. Their service before this incident was impeccable, best in the bitcoin community.

Look for "GetDataBackNTFS" a fantastic program that has saved my arse many times! Reads the drive sector by sector piecing together the filesystem metadata and any files it may find. The only thing that has stopped me from using this successfully was Darik's Boot and Nuke.
