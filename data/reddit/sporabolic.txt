@_date: 2016-08-08 16:46:07
a court would not socialize losses. this is not a bank bail-in situation. this is the fault of the exchange and their ( and the insurance company?) responsibility. the socialized loss scenario shouldn't even apply. you ever seen a bank socialized losses because it was burglarized? nobody would use such a bank. bitfenex needs to goto jail for this
@_date: 2016-08-05 16:19:53
honestly though, i understand the exchanges are the best means for price discovery (arguably a transparent cost of production plus a marginal return on capital would be the second best price setting mechanism) but my question is i would like to see some visualizations of how long the average trader had their coins sitting on bitfinex, and how often they moved the coins to and from their own control. I think we would all be un-pleasantly surprised by the continued use of exchanges as "long term bank accounts" after all humans are lazy, and prone to desensitization.

it depends on where that address goes. if it's some random shop that you bought something from, and you just accidentally sent them bitcoin, you could send them an email, explain what happened, and sign a message from your bitcoin client (with that wallet) to prove to them that you control the public address they received the coins from. if they are honest they will probably send you the coins back.  otherwise, if they tell you "too bad, so sad" you could threaten to take them to the court of public opinion (offer to smear them on reddit) for what good that would do. 
@_date: 2014-11-09 20:43:15
okay so let's say you hears about bitcoin at 1200, stayed out, and are still around, either you are trolling and waiting for the price to Drop lower, or you're actually a perma-troll/detractor and you don't intend on buying at any price, so which is it?

im speaking of speculating in the future value (that i believe is there) in peercoin. Some thing i firmly believe in, asic miners will not just shut down there asics, they will migrate to a new coin. By a long shot, peercoin is *the* asic altcoin. no other coins are even on the horizon. Peercoin is inovative, it is not just a clone coin of bitcoin with some parameters tweaked. It is a hybrid proof of work and (the first ever) proof of stake. whereas bitcoin block reward halves every 4 years, peercoin block reward halves ever x16 in difficulty. so as people mine it, it becomes scarce much faster than bitcoin all else equal. Peercoin is the future, remember who you heard it from.

only if they are using the miners to heat their house in the winter, and not paying to cool the miners in the summer.

not only don't the 99% get a taste of that 2%, they are actually paying for it in form of lost buying power as that newly created money competes against the money held by the 99% for the finite pool of goods and services. The worst part of inflation isn't that money is created out of nothing and then turned into debt by banks, its that when this occurs it deteriorates the buying power of the money people are already holding.

i agree, it's shady, and I bet people regularly abandon btc deposits instead of providing info, for example if an exchange had a monthly "maintenance " fee for dormant accounts, over a long enough timeline these abandoned accounts would slowly just get drained.

if you have a building to heat, you can mine bitcoins and get the heat as a value added co-product instead of paying heating bills directly.

its actually *safer* in that acquiring the coins to do a 51% POS attack is unimaginably expensive compared to a 51% POW attack, and unlike a POW attack where you can use the hardware for other purposes once you've completed your objective, a 51% POS attack essentially devalues your own coins the more successful your attack was..

unless you live in a cold climate and have cheap electricity costs, wherein you could sell yourself the waste heat from your miner. you are probably shit out of luck. and in the case that you are in a northern climate, time the delivery of your miner to coincide with the beginning of the heating season, so that you get all the possible benefit of the waste heat from the miner over the useful life of the device (3 - 6 months depending upon difficulty increase and cost of device).

And now thanks to the retards at the IRS he has to claim every satoshi profit as income the day its mined. The IRS is trying to have their cake and eat it too, if bitcoin is property and not currency, then its value for tax purposes is determined at the moment it is sold, not bought. For example if you mined gold, and then kept it for years and sold it, you would pay tax on the capital gain realized by the sale, not the value when you took it out of the ground.
Edit: Industrial miners looking for a place to set up will now be seriously disadvantaged to mine in the states.

My bad, after reading the op again..


I would argue that the dysfunctional state of the world is largely due to lack of personal responsibility, and personal accountability, for example governments and tax payers having to bailout "too big to fail" banks, sectors of economy, etc., if you want to be free to operate outside of this system, you are going to have to pay, the price of your freedom will be that you are personally and solely responsible for your actions and the consequences of those actions. 
i argue that the ability for lost/damaged keys to be retrieved would require a central authority. The potential for this central authority to damage the bitcoin ecosystem would outweigh the potential benefit of retrieving an individuals lost keys. Also, the ability to retrieve lost keys might encourage poor security practices by individuals and businesses. along more selfish lines, there is the sentiment that with any finite resource, a loss of part will drive up the value of what remains.

in 2 years, when the USD has devalued against bitcoin by another 1000% you will see an exponential influx of volume to online retailers. Spending bitcoin on the internet will be the new form of cross boarder shopping to take advantage of your neighbours devalued currency.

are you familiar with the concept of the exponential curve of market penetration and adoption of technology? for example smartphones, the internet, debit cards, facebook. people are notoriously bad at visualizing exponential growth. look at the magic eye dropper example by Dr. Albert Bartlett. price stability will be achieved at market saturation, only then. watch [this video]( from the bitcoin blackboard series.

Advertise, advertise, and then do more advertising. goto locla merchants and ask them about how accepting creditcards is working out for them? introduce them to bitcoin, invite them to an info session on bitcoin, show them how easy it is to use bitcoin, put up "we accept bitcoins" signs in windows. Tell the merchants that there is no downside to accepting bitcoin, there is no monthly fees, no rental equipment, no chargebacks, no waiting for 60 days to get paid from the creditcard company, bitcoin should be a merchants wet dream if you can put their fears at rest.
 Get a solid base set up for the services that a tourist would use, such as a restaurant, bar, hotel, grocery, car rental. Look at your area and see if anybody is hosting suites on 9flats or airBnB, (9flats accepts bitcoin and airbnb is very close to), contact businesses that you think are already in the right state of mind, such as farmers markets, hipster hangouts like coffeeshops or local restaurants that appear to be going for that funky hip vibe. if you are right on the trail i suspect you have a couple sporting goods and outdoor clothing stores that do a fair amount of business? Hit them up.  Then how about some tourist attractions? Ski hills? outdoor tourguides? theatres? 
There is enough pent up bitcoin buying power right now that if you can patch it together, people will visit your town just to spend bitcoins, seriously. 
Edit: use Payment processor like Bitpay or coinbase, and for the more adventurous merchants they could go solo and hold the bitcoin or cash out manually.

considering all the exchanges are "off blockchain" it is easy for them to naked short sell, you can deposit coins (and you see it move on the blockchain), and you can withdraw coins (and see it move) but what happens on the exchange you have no idea how the numbers they are showing diverge from reality or not.

my first thought is that immersion cooling will be VERY heavy to ship international packages to consumers. this will cost both you and the customers. maybe liquid cooled block like KNC, or off the shelf CPU cooling systems, but, Asicminer gen3 chips are powerful but small and many chips per board, so this may be a problem for liquid cooling systems. We have had no updates from Fried Cat about the "open source" PCB design, but the asicminer blade and cubes seem to do a good job cooling with only air. maybe air cooling is best strategy for unit that has multiple boards with many small chips.

in this sense inflation is driving our culture of consumption, "I better spend my money now, before its worth less tomorrow. What shall i spend it on? Stuff." 
This scenario, where the economy is reduced to a race to selfishly consume resources as fast as possible in order to avoid being the last person holding the worthless piece of paper, is destroying our environment, our planet. This idea is a disease.

you're costs aren't coming from remittence of bitcoin but from transfer to/from fiat. If you are earning btc and spending it, the costs actually sending the BTC are very low, and importantly, flat rate. You can transfer 1000 btc for the same cost as 10 btc.

Whats the TL;DR for how to set the change address to be the from the same private key as the sending address (the private key you swept)?? I know this is not the best way to use paper wallets, but in the event that you neglected to specify a fresh paper wallet public/private key pair to send change to, it would prevent loss. 
@_date: 2014-03-31 01:22:16
Although you are right *at the moment* this will change, the network is currently under-utilized and thus the transaction fees are high

you're absolutely correct, it doesn't have to be bitcoin, but it needs to be a reward to keep miners honest, when the reward is denominated in an token insperable from the system (the work being done) miners will uphold (hopefully) the best interest of the system. also, these "blockchain without bitcoin" arguments are for another reason, if you don't need a decentralized   trustless system there are much cheaper and faster ways to store records.

I disagree, I think its all its all about use of the *actual* currency, and an off-chain "bitcoin" is not equal to a on-chain bitcoin, one requires trust in a central authority *that the bitcoin in question even exists on chain*, being complacent with the proliferation of off-chain transactions will only end in centralized service providers trying to game the system with the use of fractional reserve banking.

okay so the hacker does the following:
breaks into bitstamp. sets up some fake accounts. gets access to hot wallet, moves coins to fake accounts. preparing to dump coins at market price for maximum price movement. 
At the same time. hacker moves their clean/legit coins to bfx or another exchange that allows leveraged trading. The instant before the stamp dump occurs. Go short on x50 leverage. 
dump bitstamp coins and rake in the profits on bfx. abandon hacked bitstamp accounts and never go back.

Actually no. blockchain is only useful if  trustless and decentralized are two of your main criteria, otherwise there are no practical reasons for using this form of database (centralized databases are orders of magnitude more efficient). With blockchain databases you need the mining reward (coins) to keep the miners incentivised to secure the network, without being tempted to become bad actors. I.e. the can make more money by mining honestly than by using their very expensive mining hardware to attack the network. The  coins and the blockchain are inseparable, the "blockchain without bitcoin" is always a clear indicator that you are dealing with a scam or an ill-informed buzzword artist
@_date: 2018-02-25 18:21:43

Yes, if it is still going to make bitcoins, the asic costs approximately as much as the bitcoins it would make would cost to buy, plus some nominal value of scrap metal or utility as a heater.
Hypothetical scenario time: 
you live somewhere it is cold for extended periods of time, you spend real money running a furnace or heaters. 
You also know about bitcoin, you can buy an ASIC (don't get scammed though!) and run it, hopefully make all your money back, and sell yourself the heat. basically you are double-dipping you are paying for electricity to run the asic, and getting heat as a co-product you would have had to pay for otherwise.

@_date: 2015-04-21 18:33:40
Yes. Simply, Watts are watts. the energy is dissipating into the room. it's not being exported as 01010101.
Have you ever held your hand in front of the fan on a 1000w asic? They are beastly hot. electricity comes in from the wall and data + heat come out the other end.
@_date: 2015-04-21 18:25:49


1000W worth of ASICs can be purchased for somewhere between the cost of a 1000W space heater and thousands of dollars, depending on the generation of chips.
1st law of thermodynamics. besides where there is mechanical energy in the fan that is spent cooling the circuits, all of the energy comes out in heat. the 1's and 0's don't use any energy themselves, your not pushing electricity down a line, you are pushing data, big difference.   
@_date: 2015-04-27 14:05:11
there are two dogmas about the interaction between price and mining. 
1 - cost of production (mining) determines market value, miners will sell coins for cost of production plus nominal return... or..
2 - market price determines viability of mining operations and miners will enter or leave the industry if there are profits to be made and difficulty will adjust accordingly. market price determines cost of production.
I believe it is somewhere in the middle.

price brings utility, how are we going to transact value in billions of USD when the entire marketcap of bitcoin is 1$? it can't attain sufficient velocity (fundamentally because of confirmation times for example) 


next to zero has been invested in increasing adoption, when is the last time you saw a bitcoin or coinbase advert on TV, billboards, magazines? never. We are currently building infrastructure and connecting partners so that when the "mass media marketing phase" starts we have a functioning system capable of handling the loads with the kinks worked out and a sexy UI.
until the marketing phase starts and brand new zero day users start acquiring bitcoin to use, building infrastructure actually has a downward pressure on price as hodlers are tempted into spending bitcoin and then fail to replace it.

the average person understands electric cars and why they are useful, the average person has no idea what bitcoin is, and if they did understand it's use and implications it would shake to the core their relationship with money, global economy, issuance of currency. and that would give them both a headache and a stomachache, and they'd probably prefer to just take their chances remaining ignorant.

pretty sure its a moving average of the last 500 blocks, anyway. As far as alt-coins i think it is the most deserving of the title "having an actual purpose", i know this might cause some controversy (among the 5 people who will read this thread) but one could argue that primecoin actually has more novel features than even bitcoin, never mind all other alt-coins of note. The relationship between stake minting and mining to set a balance between mining and spending, creating the potential for primecoin scarcity to push its value supernova and allow it to act as a reserve currency for bitcoin, man, its a crazy idea, and if it even has a slight chance of being a reality... and if you believe the "if you build (mine) it, they will come (use)." which is looking possible, ASIC miners are slowly discovering ppc as an alternative sha-256  coin to mine as btc difficulty goes full retard, and miners bring network security and therefore utility, feedback loop come self-fulfilling prophecy.

then supply and demand would dictate that more people in the area would start mining, or you could buy local first and then go buy via middle agents, it just seems to me that buying them locally from miners is way more aligned with the idea of a decentralized currency than going to western union or the bank to buy them

QE money went to the banks, who then kept it instead of lending it out, citing that people did not meet the requirements for the loans.
Helicopter money would go from the federal issuer, straight to governments (for infrastructure spending and projects) and directly to citizens as debt forgiveness or tax breaks in order to encourage the economy organically. Also, helicopter money doesn't create debt on its issuance, unlike QE which is destined to be lent out by banks (at artificially low rates)

man, your idea that AM's solo mining wallet is indicator of their success has been debunked to death. lets put it this way, If AM is selling a miner for 1 btc (bought in BTC not Fiat) and the miner takes 365 days to never quite mine 1btc (even under the most conservative estimates for future hashrate), then AM could have never made that much mining, no matter how many blocks a day end up in the solo mining wallet. the fact is that 1000 Terrahash of the total 5 (+) Petahash network is AM equipment, AND AM sold this equipment for prices that the gear will never ROI (short of a 2000$ USD/BTC). Therefore AM has earned 20% of the total revenue that all mining gear currently deployed will ever earn before it is replaced by next gen. Quit quoting the declining divs from the solo mining wallet, that is retarded.

they have a team that has deployed mid triple digit terrahash already, and that means FC has their supply chain all the way from manufacturing, assembly, distrobution, to the guys running the authorized resellers and group buys, all functioning. they''ve been selling like hotcakes since April/may and the longest supply shortage was like once for 10 days.  customers have been able to order blades and have them ship same/next day since april/may.

the thing is this: both parties in the private sale know that selling OR buying that much on the open market is counter productive, so you could say this is built in to the cost already. the coins won't all go for 600$ straight up. the total cost of the purchase  would approximately equal what the open market price would be,

peercoin, difficulty adjusts on a average if the last 500 blocks, block reward is dynamic inversely proportional to difficulty, this can theoretically act as a "green" / powersaving feature, consider how much power the bitcoin network hashrate consumes in a scenario of exponentially increasing difficulty. peercoin also has a proof of work , proof of stake feature, that anyway... I'm on my phone.. go read the white paper
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:37:39
lets start here:
- allowing new users in record volumes when the system quite clearly cant handle it.
- doing nothing while HFT (high frequency trading) bots attack their trading floor
- keeping the website and the trading engine on the same servers so when it starts to lag their means of communicating go dead
-seemingly being unable to prevent or minimize the success of the ddos attacks.
- unwilling/ unable to adopt any purpose built trading platforms and insisting on building their own, which is a clear and utter failure.
- as previously stated in this thread 1 second per trade is embarrassingly slow 
they are at best woefully incompetent and case could probably be made for criminally negligent

first off "obsolete" is a matter for the market to decide and them damn things are selling like hotcakes *still*. and once you start running hundreds or thousands of blades cooling them can account for 30-50% of your electricity. passive immersion cooling can reduce your cooling load to 2% of computational load. which in practical terms is decreasing your watt/gh. any other questions?

there is no way in hell they are going to let that immersion cooling centre sit empty until the spring, my bet (read as HOPE) is anytime now they will start climbing in hashrate, previous update from FC stated that future gen blades will fit the same form factor as block eruptors so that they can all be used together in same immersion cooling infrastructure and be replaced as necessary

thats not how disruptive tech works, bitcoin will, if everything works out, kill the traditional banking system, not integrate with it, or kill it through blending, like evolution. look at any extinction event when a new competitor for a niche is selected with a great enough pressure.

as the clear next in line for sha-256 coins (btc being 1st place) ppc stands to be a go-to for people mining with fpga and gen1 asics as the btc difficulty pushes them out of btc mining. so if you think that network hashrate and therefore security and capacity can pull price (I do) then btc miners migrating to ppc is writing on the wall that blue sky's ahead. go look at ppc network hashrate, price, difficulty and market cap during the past 6 wks, paints an interesting picture.
