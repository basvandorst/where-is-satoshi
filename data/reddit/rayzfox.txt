Every Bitcoin exchange that has ever existed has lost or stolen its users money.
@_date: 2018-01-04 18:06:26
I lost 9btc and it still hurts.
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:02:23
Even if it takes 4 our 5 years to pan out that's better than spending 10 years paying back $40,000.

Buying something because you think it is going to go up is hardly manipulation.  Selling something because you think it is going to go down is hardly manipulation.  That's the whole bubble right there.

Keep holding, the price will be above $19,442 before you ever get that paid off.
 
Also maybe somebody can explain this to me.  Communists on reddit go on and on about "Universal income" whats to stop somebody from gambling with their future universal income moneis?

Almost like the most low effort re-post ever.

I like how they wasted money to buy gox.com.  Somebody in japan should force them into bankruptcy before they spend the rest of their money trying to buy useless shit / relaunch the failed company.
 
They have $32,930,000  USD (plus 2,000 btc)  They owe $55,000,000 USD (plus 744,408 BTC that they value at the laughably low price of 160 btc each)  
 
$32,930,000 + 2,000 * 160 =  $33,500,000  (amount they have)
 
$55,000,000 + 744408 * 160 = $174,105,208  (amount they owe)
$33,500,000 / $174,105,208 = 0.1924123946941323
So you should expect ~19.2% of your money back.  If you get less than that the government of Japan failed you by not forcing them into bankruptcy.
I used numbers from:

I've been mining it first with my single core cpu, then a gtx 8600 then an amd hd 5830 since before it was worth $1 per btc.  I lost almost everything in mt. gox.   I have like .15 btc in my wallet.
@_date: 2014-03-03 23:14:08
No.  I mined my coins.  I will not re-invest in bitcoin.  I like stocks much more.  Many more choices.  It moves faster.  If you are willing to read the news about companies you can turn a profit on stocks.  Bitcoin will drop 5 and 10 percent under no news just because somebody decieded to sell or buy.

You're going to get germs on a sphincter that is literally covered in shit I think you'll be ok.

If you can take money from people by force you might as well be using USD.
@_date: 2014-03-03 23:11:22
If you lost your money in 2011 you are and idiot.
@_date: 2014-02-25 23:57:30
Yep.  Not even taxes would be filed to fuck up this bad.
@_date: 2014-02-25 23:48:31
It means they didn't audit themselves / check how much money their business was worth in 5 years.  It also means they never paid taxes because that's kind of hard to ignore when you are paying taxes.
@_date: 2014-03-04 09:44:29
They lost ZERO  bitcoin in the 2011 hack.  They went offline for ~1 month.  To get your money back all you had to do was fill out a form on mtgox.com with your username, email, password, and bitcoin address you want the btc sent to.  Lots of people didn't bother to do this because after they were hacked the value of 1 btc fell from ~37 usd to ~2 usd.  Your and idiot.
@_date: 2014-02-26 00:47:15
Yeah but if they say "there is a bubble you shouldn't invest yet"  they don't get commission and if the bubble continues they don't get commission and look like idiots until it pops.
@_date: 2014-02-26 00:50:07
Who is an idiot?
Why are they an idiot?

From what I hear the trading engine was written to handle the buy and sell volume you would expect with a Magic the Gathering exchange.  It wasn't even multi threaded because there were supposed hundreds of different cards selling at the same time.  They never traded 1 card on it though.  Instead they set up a bitcoin exchange when it caught their ADHD interest.
@_date: 2014-02-26 00:21:30
Say that again i dare you XD
@_date: 2014-02-26 00:11:18
I believe they had cold storage set up because they didn't lose their money when their password list got stolen.  I remember it i was about their 5400th user.  That was On 19 June 2011.
 
 
I used to have the database.  But have since reformated my computer and cant find it.  But it had like the first 60 thousand passwords.
@_date: 2014-02-25 23:44:46
Its not a ponzi scheme if they accidentally gave ALL the money away.  Just a really stupid bank.  With really stupid employees that probably haven't audited themselves in 5 years.  In fact they probably never bothered to pay taxes in 5 years.  Had they took they time to pay taxes they would have caught it 5 years ago.
@_date: 2014-02-26 00:21:06
19 days ago. XD
@_date: 2016-06-16 18:42:16
Yeah that shit happens.  Ask anybody from mt gox that lost $100,000 plus.  I myself lost $6000.
@_date: 2016-02-03 09:07:40
This disgusts me.
@_date: 2016-02-04 19:49:33
I think it has less to do with taxes and more to do with negative interest rates.  For example lets say you have A $100 bill.  In 10 years it will still be worth $100.  In Germany they want to force you to put your $100 in a bank so that they can apply a negative interest rate upon it.  So that when you go to with draw it, it might only be $90.  This is on top of the fact that you pay and income and sales and VAT tax.  They want to tax you for not immediately spending the money.

$50 a day but you risk going to jail.

It's open source, so Russia is not late to the race.
@_date: 2017-09-11 16:18:59
I had 9 then mtgox stole them.
@_date: 2018-03-25 02:26:43
implying you would have never not sold the btc to buy beer.
@_date: 2017-10-13 19:10:46
Your money was stolen, welcome to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-04-26 22:57:55
Then it's a very good time to buy.

Libertarians are anti-telling people what to do because they know they themselves might be wrong. 
@_date: 2015-02-15 10:44:46
A true libertarian wouldn't tell people where not to post stuff.

Anybody really not know?  This is the 3rd time its bubbled.  
@_date: 2013-12-29 10:04:05
Bitcoin is evil because it is money.  Money is evil.
@_date: 2013-07-21 20:19:05
I love paying taxes too. &lt;3~
I'm anti-tax because its violent theft.
