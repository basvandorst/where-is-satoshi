Who said it’s not a bubble.. it’s very much a speculative market at the moment and no one is able to determine the true value of these new technologies therefore the price is shooting up like crazy.. it will crush one day but who knows when it will come.

It’s not better lol... there are so many alt coins out at the moment which are so much more advanced technologically...

Pretty sure it’s only POLi payments that are affected. Bpay should still be fine

Too many weak hands.. too many inexperienced so called investors...
@_date: 2018-03-02 21:24:31
You clearly do not understand how the market works... if  everyone is buying/hodling and no one is selling what do you will happen lol... if there are no sellers do you really expect the price to go up lol...the market becomes way overbought and it will dump big time.. this is a healthy correction.. you cannot expect bitcoin to keep going up without correcting itself lol...
@_date: 2018-03-13 03:13:40
