If I wanted to spam the network to slow down confirmations I would also want to recover my fees from the spam to make the effort financially viable.  I wonder if this new mining method can be used for evil.
@_date: 2017-02-26 17:21:57
I hold BTC and XMR
@_date: 2017-02-27 16:31:04
You would have made more bitcoin by simply putting that money directly into bitcoin.  Cloud mining is a scam.

China has to wait for the current ban to expire before they can ban it again.  
@_date: 2017-02-22 01:16:11
You should buy a bitcoin it would be fun.  Don't you want to have fun?

Bitcoin is a bet on globalization and has already succeeded.  Bitcoin is a bet on society not against.  As long as we continue to cooperate on a global level in a very wide range of areas, we will continue to see bitcoin and cryptocurrencies flourish and grow.

Is it a tx limit or a size limit?
@_date: 2017-02-26 12:18:51
I didn't know blocks had a tx limit.
@_date: 2017-02-21 20:14:15
If anything it encourages crypto development because people will find solutions to the perceived gaps.  If bitcoin did everything which it cannot there would be less incentive to invent.

The headline is fake news

It's been two days, they are a bank.
@_date: 2017-02-22 01:42:59
I'm not sure what your definition of user is but Coinbase alone has multiple millions of KYC customers.  They actively confirm identity and deduplicate accounts.  Not saying they all hold btc but it's an example how your user estimate might be contradicted.

Dash is an instamined scam where the founders have the majority of coins.  He must be bluffing I seriously doubt he is that stupid.
@_date: 2017-02-21 17:40:38
People have data caps.  
@_date: 2017-02-25 14:31:35
Now I've heard it all.  Lmao
@_date: 2017-02-27 18:01:59
People around here are going to lose their minds if there is no announcement.  Twins gonna party. :)
@_date: 2017-02-24 04:20:00
There isn't one without extrapolation.  
@_date: 2017-02-21 23:59:03
Sooner or later it is not going to drop so I hodl.
@_date: 2017-02-21 21:53:57
Could this affect raffles on bitcointalk?
@_date: 2017-02-26 12:35:29
It's not perfect but with open source you can verify they can write good code without backdoors.  You have to start somewhere.
@_date: 2017-02-21 23:57:43
Gemini.com is a good alternative.
@_date: 2017-02-24 15:54:49
We can't have stupid people getting rich, it would ruin their lives.
@_date: 2017-02-24 05:48:10
Wut.  Why would we waste?
@_date: 2017-02-27 16:27:17
APIs are not bots they are channels for people/bots to use.  People have written software(bots) that trade using the APIs.

Wake me up when hashing power stops growing.
@_date: 2017-02-22 14:59:39
That's an inaccurate way to assess this since a single wallet can represent many users since exchanges like Coinbase hold bitcoin for customers.  They hold customer coins in big chunks.  A single address could represent thousands to millions of individuals.
@_date: 2017-03-02 15:11:26
That comparison is flawed because it implies that the measurement of finiteness is the utility.  You could also argue that the measurement of one Troy ounce of gold has its own utility as evidenced by our predisposition to compare 1BTC to it.  It's a brand if you will and bitcoin is proving to be the more valuable brand.
@_date: 2017-03-12 08:53:45
That's not bitcoin.  Just buy USD if you want USD.
@_date: 2017-03-16 19:07:01
That doesn't address my question.  Core offers both short and long term solutions.  What is Vers long term solution?

If my nodes traffic doubled I would have to shut it down.
@_date: 2017-03-15 20:48:18
The usage is roughly the same and it can be improved upon. Also things like LN will go a long way towards alleviating the load.
@_date: 2017-02-21 22:56:42
Only generate keys on computers you can trust.

Getting rich is useful to those who aren't rich.  Probably the most useful trait it has.
@_date: 2017-03-16 18:05:01
We have not, do not and will not trust them.

Sounds like a racist piece of shit
@_date: 2017-02-27 10:42:25
If someone had mining equipment that can make a profit, why would they share those profits with anyone?  They won't so you can count on losing money.  Some cloud mining sites don't even have mining hardware to sell and are Ponzi schemes.
@_date: 2017-03-16 12:31:50
No one trusted anyone.  That's not how bitcoin works.
@_date: 2017-03-16 19:46:58
I like the conservative approach of doing the increase after.
@_date: 2017-03-16 18:54:52
Core actually addressed this by enabling functionality that 3rd parties can use for things like LN.  
@_date: 2017-03-12 11:02:07
Why would it be illegal?

She will say anything for money.
@_date: 2017-03-12 08:55:43
An ICO?  That doesn't sound like bitcoin.  That sounds like an alt coin.
@_date: 2017-03-08 14:22:42
You are a fucking scumbag.
@_date: 2017-03-15 05:20:27
Don't assume

Segwit increases how many transactions fit in a block.
@_date: 2017-03-12 11:01:02
Stop with the FUD.  Localbitcoins is already blocked in China.
@_date: 2017-03-12 16:50:30
Nice example of how everything affects cost in some way.  You can build a crypto from the ground up to be private and still have a high cost to support the privacy. 
@_date: 2017-03-08 14:16:59
Didn't Satoshi not want them to start accepting bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-03-17 20:32:42
It is not incompetence it is a competent attempt at taking control of the bitcoin development process.
@_date: 2017-03-17 20:36:34


No, they don't want to take the chance that the minority chain becomes the majority chain because of minority community support.

So what you're saying is that the bitcoin rocket ship to the moon is carrying gold.  This whole thing is a diabolical plan to trade gold for moon dust!
@_date: 2017-03-02 16:37:41
That's nice.  Meanwhile there is still zero chance your PayPal bucks will increase in spending power.

There is no reliable percentage because it is trivial to spoof.
@_date: 2017-03-26 12:10:34
You admit you barely looked but it is the best option for a solution that doesn't solve anything.  Lovely.
@_date: 2017-03-16 11:39:31
Probably bat.
@_date: 2017-03-15 05:26:04
Why would they do that and purposely show everyone that one person controls most the BU nodes?
@_date: 2017-03-16 18:21:17
Bitcoin can't scale forever so what is his plan?
@_date: 2017-03-12 11:10:28
Low risk high reward?? LOL!!
@_date: 2017-03-26 17:47:55
Bye bye
@_date: 2017-03-14 22:08:36
No excuses.
@_date: 2017-03-16 19:17:16
So, um, why not back core?
@_date: 2017-03-12 10:27:29
Learn how bitcoin works.
@_date: 2017-03-02 15:44:21
Cloud mining is a scam.  You will lose money.  You are always better off just putting the money into buying bitcoin directly.  Don't be stupid.
@_date: 2017-03-17 20:21:52
Now they are resorting to just taking cores code and claiming they are a better option than core.  This is amazing.
@_date: 2017-04-04 21:19:59
Doesn't Gemini.com have the license?
@_date: 2017-04-06 22:21:02
