If anyone gives me confidence, it's that guy. I've watched and shared so many of his videos. He just has a way with words which make Bitcoin so understandable. Really, a hero.

I did this in my early twenties, (I was very aggressive)  regretted it when we didn't have money saved to move to a bigger house when I was thirty, now and extremely thankful for it at almost forty.  We eventually moved, and it worked out just perfect.  YMMV.


New things mostly just change norms. You'll acclaimate quickly and be looking for the next new thing.  This advise is perfect. I live this life. Financially secure, financially happy.  Want a new car?  Buy one, sure. I did.  That car will be five years old next week.  I will have it for another 5.  Splurge periodically, but moreso on experiences.  We took two week long family vacations this year.  No regreats, even though it wasn't cheap.

It's poetic really.  An instant, no-cost instant transfer of wealth from an anonymous donor demonstrating the power and utility of the very tool AA advocates.

Not how I read it. 
The exchange is the financial institution, not you. Even if it is you cashing out requires paying taxes anyway, so concealing this is already illegal.

I suspect the lowest cost / best way to capitalize on a prediction of future bitcoin growth is to study up and become an expert.  It it goes big league, industries will be begging for experts.  If not, you've gained quite a bit of knowledge nevertheless and all you've lost is time which would have been wasted browsing Reddit like me
@_date: 2016-11-23 02:51:26
While I, and likely everyone here understood the nuance, I'm not sure his audience did.
Essentially, he said "distributed good, centralized bad", but did NOT press the point that Bitcoin is necessarily ONLY in the former group. I think he accidentally implied that Bitcoin might be used either way, and did not distinguish Bitcoin from Blockchain technology
Care needs to be take to communicate these things properly, depending on the audience.

I know, this is low hanging fruit in criticising him, but it illustrates his short sightedness so well.  Bitcoin and the internet could not be more similar platforms for future innovation and Krugman either doesn't know enough to understand, or outright refuses to honestly consider it.

Wait, what? If you actually did this you would be sufficiently well-informed to know that that there is no fraud going on with bitcoin
Read the white paper. It's short and very understandable. 
Bitcoin's blockchain is an elegant solution to a very difficult computer science problem.

@_date: 2019-06-11 00:51:09
Haha - I wish I would have listened to myself.
A colleague told me about bitcoin way back in early 2012. I learned about how it worked and thought it was fantastic. I was ready to roll the dice. I set up a dedicated online banking account, linked it to MtGox thorough dwolla and was ready to buy $1000 with @ $7 each. I literally had my mouse hovering over the purchase, ready to click.
I chickened out.
$1000 / $7 \* $8000 - Fuck. That's over a million dollars.
At least I have a neat story.
I still made out ok. I sold much of what I did have north of $19,000 in Dec 2017. So... some good luck, some bad luck, I suppose.
@_date: 2019-06-12 21:27:03

Unfortunately, no one knows what the question is.
@_date: 2019-05-17 00:18:00
I know everyone has a story, but back in 2012  I had created a separate online bank account, hooked it up to dwolla, and had my mouse hovering over a $1000 purchase @ $7.
I chickened out. 
That would be worth $1.1 million today.
Meh, at least I have a good story.

[This video]( has lots of content that would appeal to Libertarians, and, as a bonus, is very accessible to the non-technical.
My favorite line is quite powerful, IMO:
"Innovation without permission - ... You don't need to ask anyone to invent a new financial instrument, and new payment system, a new service. You can just do it. You can just write the code. And you are now part of an international financial network that can run that code."
The parallels to the internet are striking, and Antonopoulos makes these points. This remains one of my favorite presentations on Bitcoin.

Ha!  Get used to it.  Not sure this is entirely relevant, but people say that we're "so lucky" when it comes to our well trained dog (who we put dozens of hours of training into) and our well behaved kids (who aren't allowed to eat crap food and watch tv all day).  Who knows, maybe Bitcoin will eventually crash (thou I don't think so).  I've found it to be more rewarding to just smile and say "That's one way to look at it".  Taking the high road always pays off, in my experience.  (Still, I completely understand the frustration)
