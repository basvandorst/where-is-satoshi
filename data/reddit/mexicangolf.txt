According to that, there's 16'707'388 Bitcoins in circulation.
Multiply that by 10'000 and you get to 167'073'880'000.
That's 167 billion. Admittedly I'm no expert so I could be wrong about this, but I seem to recall the largest _Swedish_ (Not a large country) bank (Nordea) has assets in the 600 billion USD range. 
Again, I could be wrong, but if I'm reading these things right then Bitcoin is worth a fair bit of cash, but not all that much compared to the large-ass banks in the world.

Well the money itself didn't go away, so I don't think the transfer of power is as substantial as you'd think. You buying BTC for 10'000 doesn't remove 10'000 from the economy, it just goes to a different person who, unless he or she needed the money in the moment, likely put that in savings or toward conventional gains. 
I do see your point, I just don't think Bitcoin itself is substantial enough at the moment to signify some greater change in regards to the global power structure.

Didn't realize they were in the banking business.

What is your point then, if you don't mind my asking?
You claim that there's "a landslide", I can somewhat agree with that. You claim that there's a transfer of power, I cannot agree with that.
Care to try and enlighten me on what power the banks are losing out on?

I know I'm a few days late but use your own words to describe to me how the US banking system works. It doesn't need to be in-depth, just do the best you can.
Do not link me youtube videos or the work of others. Your own words, to demonstrate the understanding you smugly claim to have.

I'm no expert but my understanding is that the desired qualities of a _currency_ is entirely not there when it comes to Bitcoin. If the entire world were ran on Bitcoin _right now_ the best way to make money would be to not spend it, and that's outright terrible for the economy.

So you're expecting bitcoin to go from the ~$6'000 to over a million USD in less than 15 years (I'm assuming your nurse friend is over 25)?

I respond well to facts and good rationale, not your shitty (seriously, emphasis on shitty, be less patronizing) salesman tactics.
The whole "research it yourself!" is simply another way of saying "this is bullshit". Nobody who has a justifiable reason to be as confident as you are lacks the material to support it. Nobody who actually lacks the time to make their case spends so much time writing shallow Reddit posts defending their case without using the aforementioned material.
As for Google that just highlights your ignorance more than anything else you've said here so far, and that's saying something. Don't use it on the next person you talk to, they might know more about general investing than I do and *know* how to tear that argument down proper. What I can say is that diversification isn't a thing just because it's fun to say, it's because it's the smart thing to do. People who know what they're about do not speak with certainty in regards to the economy, the economy is borderline impossible to read accurately over the long haul and I'd be interested to see if you could find _ONE_ source that supports your 166'000% growth in the next 11 years. 
In fact, that's a good point. You say others know about this, so link me an article or a blog or whatever that _has_ done the work (I'm sure they exist, after all this is _HUGE_ money to be made) you refuse to do. I'll be eagerly awaiting a post with the link(s) (the more the better).
@_date: 2019-05-07 21:24:45
You do realize that when you're suggesting ~166'000% growth over an 11 year period people aren't going to believe you, right?
Your 47% figure is also kind of a misrepresentation. Of those 47%, 57% of them would buy crypto assets directly, which is ~27%, not 47%.
You're also grossly overestimating how much money matters to me. I wasn't kicking myself for not buying Bitcoin before the Christmas spike and I won't kick myself for not buying Bitcoin the next time it spikes, I was just curious if you had any actual material to support your claim. Turns out you don't, it's just common bullshit.
The math you spoke of, for instance. Could you show that?
@_date: 2019-05-07 22:34:03
Most people who made their fortune in Bitcoin got lucky, and they might get lucky again.
Some ignorant and incredibly dumb motherfuckers in that group will mistake their luck as "skill", and they'll grow insufferable.
You belong to that latter group. You'll deny it, but I know you know I'm right. I normally don't speak with such confidence on these matters, but fact is that you claim to act as a Bitcoin investing crusader in real life and you obviously act so on Reddit. Any such person would have the material on hand to make their case, as a person claiming what you do will run into skeptics almost exclusively. Substantiating material, not loose articles talking about the total amount of money in the world, is something you'd keep available.
No, instead of providing any of that you've spent over half your sentences being patronizing, and trying to cause "FOMO" (fear of missing out)/making me remember FOMO. 
I ain't the sharpest tool in the shed but fuck me this particular brand of bullshit stinks more than my own, and that's saying something.

Conventional investment does not see the returns you're promising your friends, so why would they believe you? You're quite literally selling an idea that's too good to be true, all the while likely glossing over that you're no guru, you're a kid who got lucky because Bitcoin spiked like a motherfucker.
Don't get me wrong I'm honestly happy for you, but do not be an ass because you won the lottery. 
Feel free to prove me wrong though, I might be biased against your position but I ain't above being proven wrong. Show me some numbers and give me an honest to fuck presentation of an investment strategy that would let your nurse friend retire at 40, for instance.
