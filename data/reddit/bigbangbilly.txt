What if it is a Toshiba Satellite L305-S5933? Somehow it is able to run TF2, Gmod, HL1, and HL2 and I did not changed the video setting for the games. Also the charger is in 24/7. So should I or not?

So do they convert bitcoin into "real" cash? By real I mean commonly accepted.

That is because it is the computer that is doing the mining. You can take a shower and do other clothing optional activities while your computer is mining.
