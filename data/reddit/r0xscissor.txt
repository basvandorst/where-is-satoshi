I can't believe this comment got so many upvotes. I'm starting to believe what peter todd said about this community: "Much of the Bitcoin community is an infosec cargo-cult". The linked post from OP had some very valid points. Believe it or not there are actually people who care about others over the internet.
The comment made by is tinfoil hat thinking, yet it still manifests a circkjerk fest of upvotes as if to reaffirm the notion that the comment is somehow factual.

Add USD bank wire so you can increase liquidity and actually have a market so you can save the Venezuelan economy.
People are paying $8000 per bitcoin on the Venezuelan exchange

But the potential is there in plain site, isn't it beautiful. Maybe you should start a remittance service at your country you are working at, it should pull in alot of customers.

I would also prefer if bitcoin was hedged to gold, not fiat.
@_date: 2015-05-03 09:52:34
agreed. But not yet.

fuckin bs, coins can still be retraced to mt gox, even though you don't know who is spending the chain of txs after it.
@_date: 2015-04-28 10:09:10
Its just an example. Replace mt gox with something else.
