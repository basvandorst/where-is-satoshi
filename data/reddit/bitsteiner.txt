There are periods, when transactions waiting to get confirmed exceed the maximum blocksize. This is caused mainly by the variance of the block confirmation interval (random distribution). If the confirmation intervals increase for a period of time a backlog is building up, but when the confirmation intervals decrease again this backlog is eaten up quickly. A backlog would also be building up with much larger maximum blocksize, because the block confirmation interval is not predictable. From the charts below one can see, that the backlogs are only temporary phenomena and there are periods when even low fee transactions get confirmed within the next block:  Solutions are on the way.

Helicopter money inflates the money supply while it has no deflationary effects (obligation to pay it back). It is inherently inflationary. You just have to make it big enough in order to get the price inflation up. 


It's a misconception you can read everywhere, that central banks control the economy. They can only provide liquidity to the economy, but not create demand of the economic actors.  If the economic actors are unable or unwilling to take out more loans than old loans are paid back (less money is created than destroyed) no matter how low the interest rates are, the economy enters a deflationary downward spiral and the central banks can little do about it (at the moment).
@_date: 2016-08-15 18:52:00
With interest rates already around zero and balance sheets inflating via QE programs the only powder left at central banks is real money printing (net money). Although it is illegal, they will find loopholes, e.g. zero coupon perpetual bonds. Then money issued by a central bank would be still covered by debt formally, but it is net money practically (there is no obligation to pay it back ever). It's like getting a credit card with zero percent interest rate and no payment obligation ever. If I got such a card, I would rush to the stores and buy quickly whatever I can carry home before prices explode.

Your description is just a symptom, not the cause.
Deflation is primarily caused by less credit created than credit destroyed. Deflation is an inherent problem of the monetary system, which occurs in general in de-leveraging cycles as reaction to over-leveraging (e.g. housing bubble, which has nothing to do with modern technology). Economic actors are cutting back on debt-funded activity and trying to reduce their debt by becoming more efficient (cutting cost aso). Technology is just a tool to increase economic efficiency and a debt based economy stimulates this (no economic actor wants to end up in the negative but positive).

@_date: 2016-08-29 17:34:29
Law and empirical evidence proves that I am correct. 
All money in circulation are liabilities of the central banks, while are backed by assets (mostly treasury notes and other debt). You can look this up on the balance sheet of the Federal Reserve (published on their website). Otherwise the system would be corrupt, it would be in violation of laws. 
Empirical evidence shows, that monetary systems which violated that principle by issuing net money ended up with high inflation or hyperinflation. Even high interest rates couldn't reverse this.

How is a permissioned blockchain safer than a database? If team C fucks up (write access to the blockchain gets compromised), the blockchain gets corrupted as well. How do you know which entries are legit, which not? Any future transactions might become a result of a corrupt transaction, so the blockchain is useless from that time. The only way to fix it, is to roll it back. I see no security advantage here. The only advantage I see, is because a blockchain is a backup of itself at the same time, is just easier and safer to fix **in case of a security breach** than a database (restoring from backups), but it does not prevent security breaches!

If you do it a very inefficient way, yes.

Spending is not enough, but credit creation. Without fresh credit existing debtors chase less and less money = deflationary. It's like in a chain mail game, where participation is dwindling, then the whole system will collapse at one point. In order to keep it running, the government substitutes the missing players aka debt based government spending. Since government spending is not for profit, productivity is declining, worsening economic conditions and outlook so less private financing aka new debtors. Government has to jump in again and do more spending aso. It's a death spiral.

This is nothing else than exchanging IOUs on their blockchain. To redeem the money, the receiver of the IOU has to go to the central bank where the cash was deposited. 
Besides the fact, that is more like a check than a currency, it sounds rather complicated, since there are more than 100 central banks in the world. Another question is, if each central bank will be allowed to pay out those IOUs. This might require changes of existing law in all participating jurisdictions. And there needs to be some kind of arbitration with the existing net settling between banks. If the deposits of a bank get exhausted by net settling, there would be no money left to redeem those IOUs.

Central banks can reverse the "trend" if they change their policies accordingly. 
The problem is, they are not allowed to use those tools. All fiat is backed by debt, so helicopter money (=net money, not backed by debt) is illegal, but if the law can be changed it becomes legal. That's why they are asking the politicians for help this time. Once it has been changed, it can't be reversed again and never will be (you can't collect the net money back). Essentially the system gets corrupted, the trust in the currency erodes, but this is what the central banks want, don't they?

What the author gets wrong is that transactions in the the traditional banking system do not take so long because of an outdated computer technology, but because of the organization of the banking system with a hierarchy of branches and central banks and with net settling only once per day.

Bitcoin is fast and efficient because the tokens are an asset itself and do not require exchange of collateral, which is held in central banks or somewhere else.

The design of bitcoin allows practically an unlimited number of addresses per user. It's also recommended using a new address for the change after every transaction. I had to get a confirmation that my change address was registered, otherwise my transaction does not confirm. Are they serious? ChainAnchor would be a nail in the coffin for Bitcoin (maybe the actual intention behind it) = destroy it per bureaucracy. 
Also, how does it scale? At today's VISA levels the address database would bloat quickly (several GBs per day, if a new change address is used for every transaction). A miner had to check 10,000 or more transactions per second against a database of several TBs.

The status of the Dollar as reserve currency has some impact here, but there is another significant difference between Weimar and the US. The Federal Reserve does not provide net money like the German Reichsbank essentially did, but just temporary liquidity, which provides a strong anti-inflationary tool at the same time. When inflation (in terms of CPI/PPI rise) sets in (what all are hoping for), the Federal Reserve can dump their treasury holdings in the market,  thus driving interest rates up and fighting inflation. If that is really working has to be proven, but as long as a majority of market participants is confident about that, there will be no Dollar devaluation just because of QE.

I would generalize it: direct machine-to-machine payments will allow them to pay and get paid for automated delivery of goods and services just in time and frictionless (in terms of ability to re-spend). This will enable **autonomous economic interactions** between machines and lead to better economic decisions as well. The ability to quickly re-spend will reduce cost of credit.
* Self driving car drives autonomously (possibly without drivers and passengers) to an automated charging station and pays for the electricity to the charging station. 
* Charging station pays for the electricity from an electricity producer per kWh. 
* Printer orders a new toner cartridge from an automated online store.
* Manufacturing robot orders supplies. 
* A set-top box pays for consumed media (per per view) autonomously.
Bitcoin simplifies that since it is just a piece of permission-less code added to the machine's software (no permissions by humans to use the credit or debit account in their name are required).

Inflation is a necessity in a positive feedback loop in order to keep it going, because deposits have no maturity while debt has. Economic growth is a result of our monetary system, but it can't be good in the long term because it depletes the resources of our planet to a point that destroys the existence of mankind itself. Just do the math, inflating the economy makes the planet inhabitable very soon on the scale of civilization. Our monetary system needs to change in order to avoid this.

If you deposit $20, and then someone else takes out a loan of $20, does your deposit disappear? No, you still have a balance of $20 with the bank, while an additional balance of $20 was created. 
To be precise, banks do **not** create money out of thin air but credit out of collateral. They create deposits[=liabilities] while taking collateral[=assets] into their possession (e.g. cars, real estate or other assets for which the loan is created). Only banks are allowed to do this no other businesses. It's called the banking privilege.

Maybe there is a problem with atomic cross chain swap, I am not familiar with that and it might be something different I have in mind.
As I understand payment channels, they are trustless, decentralized and can be applied to any blockchain. 
If I structure a transaction cross blockchains with a counterparty into very small steps, then the whole transaction process becomes essentially trustless (if I can tolerate a very small risk). E.g., I could structure a transaction worth $10.000 into negligible amounts, then start transacting "penny for penny" with my counterparty. Then the risk both sides take is probably way less than overall transaction costs (opening an closing of payment channels on both blockchains - a cost risk that I take anyway).

Right, mandate is to allow inflation, which proves my point that the Federal Reserve constantly increases the USD in circulation.   
BTW, the Federal Reserve tries to influence this by monetary policy, but money supply can only grow, if there is more demand for loans than existing loans. If there are no new debtors willing and solvent money supply is shrinking, but this is not a result of the Federal Reserve. The only mandate of the Federal Reserve is to avoid a shrinking money supply, because it would be catastrophic in a positive feedback loop (deflationary downward spiral). Therefore they always try to influence through monetary policies to increase the money supply. They never decrease the money supply, but try keep the growth (inflation) in check.

They leak on a weekly, monthly or annually basis, which is proven by empirical evidence.

If banks go bankrupt because loan defaults, deposits are at risk as a result. This is exactly what I wrote. The FDIC has the funds to cover a few banks, but not a system wide collapse.

Bailouts didn't go through the FDIC, this is right. But Bailouts had nothing to do with paying out deposits of failed banks, because bailouts were used to prevent banks failing. Nonetheless almost 500 banks failed after the financial crisis and depositors had to get paid out by the FDIC, because the banks reserves were mostly wiped out by loan defaults. Pls. note that the sum of MZM is way bigger than the resources of the FDIC, so if too many banks fail, the deposit insurance fails too (although it is capped per account anyway).

US-Dollar is not generally accepted as well.


This is a fiat definition, made up by a power. It would claim that currencies exists only if governments say so, which is wrong. There are countries in the world without functioning governments, but people still have currency since they need to do commerce in order to survive.  


Bitcoin does not circulate on crypto exchanges, this is simply wrong. It is a p2p-currency which circulates between people, retailers, institutions and governments. 
US Dollar has been the preferred currency in dark markets for decades. The illegal drug market in the US alone is more than  $100 billion/year.


Wrong. 


This is changing. Swiss banks offer Bitcoin accounts. Exchanges like Coinbase is essentially a bank, since it is almost regulated like a bank and holds fiat and cryptos for you. 


It's a pure market currency. Pegs are anti-market and most pegs have failed in history. Most currencies are floating. Not an argument. 




Two third of all government issued currencies did not held its value. They simply disappeared. You are just reducing your definition on the US-Dollar, which is kind of short sighted.

If my calculations are correct, annual world gold mining produces 36,000,000 t CO2/ year (2015, 12 kg CO2/gram, output 3000 t /year). Bitcoin would be at 2,628,000 t CO2 / year in 2020 (4 t CO2/BTC, output 12.5 BTC/block) based on the estimation in that article.
Also this is a bit misleading: "Even in the optimistic scenario, just mining one bitcoin in 2020 would require a shocking 5,500 kWh, or about half the annual electricity consumption of an American household." There will be only 1 bitcoin produced per 190 housholds in the whole year 2020.
In addition the savings effects of BTC on the financial system have to be taken into account. There will be no such savings for gold nor has gold the same utility as bitcoin. 
In addition bitcoin mining can make much more use of renewable energy than gold production (mostly diesel powered machines). And not to forget the environmental impact of gold mining (water, nature destruction).

Money can never go instantaneously between different banks or FRBs. It has to clear some way, e.g. over the central bank. Your phone app just shows you an account balance, middlemen are taking a temporary risk, but they could charge you later, if something went wrong (reversible transaction). In contrast, Bitcoin is an irreversible transaction like cash is. A bank will never let you go with cash of an uncleared (not settled for cash yet) transaction. Try the following: Redeem a check with your bank and close the account the next moment (where they had to honor the check immediately). They don't let you do that, but ask you to come back several days later.

Not any check. The origin account must be funded, the bank must be solvent and liquid, the banking system must be functioning, aso.. There are many requirements, before a check can be redeemed. It's not like cash. 
In any fiat system bank deposits are way bigger than available cash (you can verify that data on the publicly available statistics of the Federal Reserve ). This is because banks make loans "out of thin air" and do not need the same amount of cash to make a loan (essentially commercial banks do not lend money of others, but they create credit out of collateral). Otherwise banks coudn't increase the money supply and deposits were always equal to cash.

That debt doesn't matter is incorrect. Debt matters primarily with debt backed currencies (which are most fiats), since all deposits are just reflected debt (money=debt). If debt can't be paid back, deposits become worthless. The value of a fiat currency anticipates a government default long time in advance, it is not just a one time event. E.g., with the rising government debt their bonds are down rated and therefore their price gets under pressure. Also the foreign exchange value of a currency depends on the ability of a country to pay back its debt.
In contrast, gold backed currencies preserve their value even if a government goes completely belly up.

Because banking is a trusted system, regulation is a requirement in order to create trust. Otherwise banking would be drowning in scams. These cost are not just for fun, they are essential for the functioning of the banking system.
In contrast, Bitcoin is a trustless system, secured by math, decentralization and use of electrical energy. The energy burden (PoW) is a necessity in order to make manipulation economically unrewarding. The question is, how high the energy burden should be. The beauty of Bitcoin is, that no central authority decides about it, but a free market. If fees will get too high, usage will go down, which will decrease fees again - it's a perfectly self-regulating system.

It didn't claim that credit can expand indefinitely. Credit expansion is limited and depends on regulation (e.g. reserve requirements) and real demand. 


The state defines legal tender and creates a central bank. It prints the notes, but is not allowed to issue cash, only the central bank can do that against collateral. Commercial banks do not need cash in order to create credit, they need own reserves (reserve requirement), which is a small fraction of the credit amount only. When banks create loans, they increase the money supply (monetary aggregates M1, M2 or M3), since the amount of deposits increases while the amount of cash does not change. Credit creation inflates the money supply which can create price inflation, depending on overall productivity of credit. Credit can be used just to drive up prices of existing goods (e.g. used homes) or to increase the production and sale of new goods (e.g. new cars).

The technology is almost 10 years old. They admit, that the even don't understand it completely today, nor they have made any efforts to adopt the technology (although it is permissionless and open source).
The Federal Reserve cannot decide it, it would require new law. But I doubt that the central bank and the government are interested in open, decentralized, permissionless money at all. It would need to be centralized for the purpose of controlling it anyway. Even if they adopted blockchain technology, they would use only a subset of features, which makes it inferior to a decentralized, permissionless and open ledger.

This "fractional reserve" theory is just an over complicated and incorrect obfuscation that banks essentially create credit out of collateral ("lending the same money multiple times" is nothing else than creation). 
"Fractional reserve" is just a regulatory force to limit credit creation temporarily. The reserves in this system are increasing nonetheless: new credit increases deposits, increased loan amounts increase bank profits and this increases their reserves. In the long term the loop never ends. If the loop stopped, the system would collapse, since deposits have no maturity but debt has. It has to be steadily inflated to keep it running. In fact, it's nothing else than a giant pyramid scheme.

There are multiple risk factors, that you can't access your funds, at least temporarily: 
* website down
* internet down
* exchange got hacked (pls note that insurances don't protect against any cause, also reimbursement can take years)
* abuse of funds, e.g. exchange lends them to short sellers (there is nothing that prevents it, only contracts and law that deters them to do it, maybe loopholes which even allow it)

This is incorrect, all cash in circulation is money that the commercial banks borrowed from the central bank and paid it on demand to the public against deposits.

Right, there can't be such a mechanism, since the users control the nodes and not a central authority. No one can force users to upgrade, it is a consensus mechanism.  
If there was such a mechanism, then it wouldn't be a decentralized cryptocurrency, but a bot controlled by someone.  
Their definition of "promptly upgrading its software code" is also moot. They require protocol revisions (hard forks) in order to be a "upgrade of its software code". As we know, software upgrades of Bitcoin nodes happen all the time and there is a mechanism for that (BIP and signaling readiness).

The bank got the title of your car as collateral (you don't own it, but the bank = an asset for them). The bank can just write $20,000 of deposits in your account (=liability for them).  
Now asset=liability, everything is fine, except that the $20,000 didn't exist before.
 
This is how commercial banking works. I agree, it's simplified, because there is regulation (reserve requirements aso.),  but essentially this is how banks create credit out of collateral and thus increasing the money supply.

Essentially your are right, banks create credit out of collateral (but not from existing deposits), which creates new deposits. But the article you linked claims something about "lending deposits", which is even impossible by simple logic and math, since banks inflate the money supply. That banks balance the books with money from retail deposits is just a regulatory requirement in order to limit the credit inflation. But since new credit creates new deposits, it becomes a positive feedback loop and allows infinite credit expansion in the very long term. This would be impossible if would just lend deposits.

There are countless examples in history that such bans are not efficient, they do even promote more crime. As soon as ordinary people experience hardship, e.g. through financial repression, they have no choice but to ignore such bans in order to survive. Another effect of a ban would be technological improvements in order to circumvent bans easily, while the innovation and technology cannot be applied by corporations, meaning the country will lose grounds economically to other nations, which are less restrictive.

What makes fiat money break is the fact that it has to expand exponentially. New debt has to replace old debt, while the overall debt has to increase, otherwise the prices of the debt collateral reduces and the system collapses. Which is essentially a pyramid scheme.

Because banks create more deposits through credit creation than they have in reserves. When loan losses eat up their reserves, the bank goes bankrupt and people are at risk to lose their deposit, and the fear spreads into the whole system (domino effect). Since there are more deposits than reserves the whole system can go belly up. The only way to avoid it is to bail out the system, so it is an inherit problem of fiat, just not a political. If the fiat system would get bailed out, it would collapse and all savings become essentially worthless. You had to start a new fiat system - also known as 'reset'.

It's just a question of regulatory definitions, what a bank is able to book as assets. If a student loan contract, which can't be defaulted and where the debtor pledges its future income is allowed, then the bank can book it as asset too.

No one claims that LN will decentralized in the same way as Bitcoin is, as well no one claims all payments will go over the LN network. There is no much liquidity needed for an LN hub, because big transactions will go over the blockchain anyway and not over LN. Also the term liquidity is relative. What do you consider as "rich"? To start a bank you have to have tens of millions in funding.  Compared to LN, a few BTC provide plenty of liquidity for a hub and I wouldn't consider this as an opportunity for rich people only.

I didn't claim deposits were the cause, but the run on is a result of a financial meltdown. Please read what I wrote. 
If you really understand the banking system, it is simple math why too many defaulting loans in a "fractional reserve banking" can cause a financial meltdown. Banks were still the biggest holders of mortgages. A crashing real estate market puts all mortgages at risks, it doesn't matter which mortgages default first. Trust evaporates when banks are at risk of bankruptcy and then you have the famous run on the bank, because people suddenly realize that the volume of deposits multiple times of available money is a big problem. It requires very simple math to realize how this will end. With sound money aka full reserve system you don't have that risk.

No, there is no digital Dollar for payment in existence, by law or in practice. Only notes, coins and reserves of the banks with the central banks are Dollars. The latter can be electronic deposits with the central bank, but only commercial banks have access to them, not the public. What people mean by 'digital Dollars' are claims against banks and other institutions denoted in Dollars. E.g. electronic banking transfers, credit card transfers or electronic check transmissions are all just claim transfers from one counter party to another counter party denoted in Dollars, but no Dollars. Actual Dollars still have to be moved to make this transfer complete. When you have a deposit with your bank, you receive just a contractual claim against the bank. To have this claim in digital form, does not make your claim a digital Dollar. Of course, you can use these claims as medium of payments and these claims mimic 'digital Dollars', but with such a payment no Dollars are transferred, just claims against third parties denoted in Dollars. When a third party e.g. your bank ceases to exist, your claims become mainly worthless.
And please stop claiming things, you don't understand.

I didn't claim that a gold standard prevents bubbles and crashes. Bubbles and crashes exist as long as mankind does commerce, since it cannot be prevented in finding the right price in a market. In a gold or other commodity standard, you cannot wipe out debt by printing money, therefore the creditors take a loss in a crash. This leads to more cautious behavior of credit creators and is a self-healing process for an overheated market. In contrast, with a fiat printing press creditors get bailed out. In addition credit creators become even more reckless (moral hazard) and the next bubble will follow immediately. 
As evidence just take a look at the exploding monetary base since 1933 (data available from the Federal Reserve). As you wrote before, removing the gold standard was a deliberate act to allow this.

Overstock.com CEO Patrick M. Byrne did long research on that topic (his company was impacted by that problem) and made a great presentation on naked short selling. Naked short selling allows traders to sell shares which have been allocated by the broker but weren't delivered yet. Essentially this is creating shares out of thin air, since the holder still owns the shares and can sell them too - the same share can be sold multiple times, which leads inevitably to 'failed to delivers'.  The supply of fake shares can stay for a very long time in the system. There is an official database on 'failed to deliver' shares (REGSHO). This also results sometimes in more votes at shareholder meetings than shares were issued by the company. 
Dark Side of the Looking Glass by Patrick Byrne:
SEC: Data Fails-to-Deliver Data
Naked short selling with Bitcoin is nearly impossible, since holders can demand delivery out of the exchange into a private wallet anytime 24/7/365 and the exchange won't risk to become insolvent.

This reflects QE only. Before QE, the central bank did not purchase or sell assets. In addition, the central bank does not buy and sell to/from commercial banks, but in the open market.
The Federal Reserve cannot manipulate the overall money supply, they can only try to influence it via monetary policy, but they cannot control the privates to increase or reduce their debt.  


This is in part incorrect. The amount of loans banks can make depends on the reserve ratio and other regulatory parameters, but the interest rates for loans are defined by the market. The central bank can only try to influence/manipulate that via policies. A higher Federal funds rate makes the banks pay back borrowed cash, a lower Federal funds rate makes the banks to borrow cash. The motivation of banks to borrow/payback cash is not driven by the Federal funds rate, but the interest rate spread to their reserves (treasuries). To borrow cash from the central bank is also just a secondary necessity in order to satisfy the increased demand in cash circulation. Commercial banks create credit in the first place based on demand and regulatory constraints. 


First, most economic crisis are caused by too much credit creation, where loans become less and less productive (speculation vs. investment into production of goods and services, see housing bubble) and then a critical amount of loan defaults cause a chain reaction through rising market interest rates. The irony is that then the problem is tried to be cured with the same measures which led to the crisis in the first place: more loans. This is just irresponsible bubble economics. Instead the markets should work out such overleveraged allocation of capital, by letting the inefficient and irresponsible actors go bankrupt.
 


Economics is not a science, there a different theories maintained. Some economic theories are either obsolete, or just an obfuscation in order to keep the status quo for the elites. 
"It is well enough that people of the nation do not understand our banking and monetary system, for if they did, I believe there would be a revolution before tomorrow morning."
~Henry Ford


The current economic crisis is just a result of too much debt. The Federal Reserve can only try to stimulate credit creation, but if privates are not willing or unable to borrow, the "new money" from the Federal Reserve has little impact. In the past economic growth was created by increasing debt levels compared to GDP, but the higher it gets, the less productive it becomes (empirical evidence). This is a dead end, the only way out is wiping out the debt via high inflation or hyperinflation.

The reason "we" moved away from the gold standard, was simply the fact that governments were technically bankrupt. They were so much in debt, that they could not fulfil their promises.

This is not sustainable at all and will lead to a total destruction of the planet within a few hundred years.

No it's the opposite. In a gold standard a central bank cannot create money out of thin air in order to bail out bad economic actors, like they did during the last financial crisis. When economic actors are accountable, they become more responsible and avoid misallocation of capital. Also bankruptcies are a mechanism to weed out bad economic actors, they are necessity in a healthy market economy. A gold standard would only lead to slower growth, but this is necessary anyway if civilization wants to survive another few hundred years. Even a moderate economic growth rate of 3% annually will lead to the destruction of the planet within a few centuries.

The EU banking system is an accident waiting to happen. Target2 balances just made a new ATH. ECB balances are on a record high too, with their QE program they buy even questionable corporate bonds. A Target2 balance is nothing but a claim of a national central bank against the ECB, while the national central bank has to print money based on the Target2 balance. The reason for rising Target2 balances is that other central banks ran out of collateral, they are essentially bankrupt. They just don't admit it and essentially print money via Target2. This money is not backed by AAA rated government bonds, but just a claim (IOU) against the ECB. Their SEPA system (wiring money across the Euro-zone) is fast and efficient, but it leads to accumulation of Target2 balances. One day the wealthy European countries have to pay the price for that. The EU banking system is an accident waiting to happen. Ordinary people are clueless what is going on with the Euro.

Right, wallets generate and store your private keys. 
There are different mediums to store the private keys: HDD, flash memory, paper, brain. 
The coins on your coinbase app are stored on coinbase servers. You don't own them. When access to their service is interrupted, you can't use your coins. Better transfer your coins to a local wallet. 
Electrum is a very popular wallet:  
First you have to set up your local wallet, then go to he coinbase app and transmit your coins to an address in your local wallet.

FDIC protects against isolated events like failures of single or small banks. During the last financial crisis, the FDIC could have gone belly up if the government didn't force JPMorgan to take over Wamu. If you have another severe financial crisis, it is unsure if FDIC can cover. And the Congress is unable to bail out 99% of deposits (which is equivalent to 15 trillion Dollars by the way). The fiat system is a dangerous shell game, that's why we got crypto. If you believe that the fiat system will never break, then crypto makes no sense at all to you, you should stick with checks, credit/debit cards and bank wires.

FDIC has limits, it can never cover all funds. I also wonder why they need FDIC at all.

And the reason for the insane FED balance sheet expansion was ? .... Fight deflation and create inflation. No?


Government spending is very meaningful to inflation, since it increases M2. QE isn't formally money printing, but essentially it is through a backdoor (primary dealers buy on a Treasury auction -&gt; primary dealers sell it to the Federal Reserve for cash -&gt;  rinse &amp; repeat). The massive amount of QE money is already spent by the government to privates (to pay wages, salaries, equipment, government investments, entitlements aso.) and does not sit in a Federal Reserve vault. 
In addition, the government borrows money through QE at zero interest rate, since the interest paid by the US government to the Treasury bill holder (in this case the Federal Reserve) is paid back to the US government again (by law).  
That we don't see a significant increase in M2 is due to unwinding of privates (paying back their loans, which destroys deposits), which is offset by government spending in order to fight deflation and create inflation. The problem is that government spending is the least productive spending (in terms of GDP, pls. google "marginal productivity of debt") for various reasons (e.g. governments never pay back their loans, they just roll them over). 


That is wishful thinking, since the government gets more and more dependent on zero interest loans. If the rates rose due to increasing supply of Treasury notes, then the government had to fund their interest payments by increasing the volume of Treasury emissions, which would increase supply further and would start a vicious circle. In the end the government would spend a growing share of the GDP for interest payments and go bankrupt. So this is a no-go, the Federal Reserve has no choice but to keep or even increase their balance sheet ... unless privates start borrowing like crazy (credit growth to offset the goverment spending), but this is an illusion due to already high debt levels of the population (they lack assets as collateral). 
The only way out of this dilemma is to wipe out all debt by massive inflation (and of course there will be victims like savings, pensions or entitlement recipients since debt=deposits).

2017 debt/GDP is just 0.4% below 2016, which is even in range of error margin of GDP measurement. Even if, 1 year doesn't make a trend, but the last 40 years do. That mostly own citizen are creditors makes it even easier for the government to default on their debt, since the citizen cannot legally sanction their government nor is there any legal right on government resources, since all government debt is uncollateralized debt. Its just backed by the believe and trust that the government can pay it back in fiat, which they can do in the end through the printing press one way or the other, but that is just another form of default. If you believe that the government pays its own citizen back in "natural resources/resource contracts", you are fucking naive.

If transaction volume is artificially inflated by bogus transactions, fee will go up. Most people will be inclined to pay a premium on the current fee in order to be ahead of the other transactions.

Miners could be tempted to inflate the transaction volume if there is a price discovery for fee - in other words they could manipulate the fee market to their advantage.

You bring up an important point when comparing asset classes. A house can be easily confiscated by authorities, while with Bitcoin it's not possible. But Bitcoin can make it harder to confiscate property by a government, if not impossible, if the society agrees to use such a system for ownership records, since only the rightful owner can release the property. Therefore Bitcoin, can even replace branches of government. The asset aspect of Bitcoin is just one facet among others.

Why not let a free market solve the problem? Fees can be the solution. Miners will be interested in prioritizing transactions by fee amount. Miners could also pay full nodes for filtering out spam and low fee transactions to keep the transaction volume manageable with 1MB blocks. The bitcoin-blockchain is a valuable resource and we should not waste it with dust payments and protect it from spam (like it was already done in the past), while maintaining it for the general public as well as businesses more as a premium service, which will be still way more efficient than traditional money services.
I consider bitcoin more as the foundation/ground layer/framework for many other services like payment processors or ideas like the Lightning Network. It seems to be more effcient to do certain transaction "offline" and certain "online". For everyday low value transactions the risks are low and the blockchain is a waste while for critical and high value transactions a highly secure and decentralized system makes sense (nobody carries quarters in an armored truck but for a box of gold bars or very important documents it makes sense). 
1 MB blockchain "restriction" will the breeding ground for new, better, more efficient solutions based on the blockchain. IMHO it's not a good idea to try to solve any problem by tweaking a single technology.
Just my two cents.

Not so much European tourists and not so much in Greece, Greeks like off-record transactions for obvious reasons. Cash is the most common payment method in Greece, especially if you travel to the islands or into the country. In order to get cash tourists from Europe usually use ATMs in Greece, because it is the same system (EC,  very low fees, almost every village has one), but that is now a problem.

It's nothing weird. You have to distinct between "money" and "liabilities for money". 
Money is coins, notes and reserves of the banks with the central bank. Banks can't create that (e.g. they can't issue additional coins or notes). That's why banks have to borrow  "money".
Bank's "liabilities for money" are the balances of the customers with a bank. A bank has to pay out "money", if a customer requests getting paid out a certain amount from his balance. Since banks can't create "money"  they have to borrow it. 
I completely agree with your second paragraph, except for the part that "money" and "liability for money" is not the same.

Sure, no manipulation guarantees returns but it is still a possibility. Manipulations happen in the rest of the world all the time and they pay returns, otherwise they would not be there. In contrast Bitcoin mining is unregulated, so there are even no legal risks for manipulators.

Right, but how can be checking deposits higher than all cash and bank reserves?  That is by your theory impossible, since banks can only loan out money which existed before. 


Simply the bank puts the value of the car on on side of their book (assets, they have the title), the loan sum for the car on the other (liabilities). Then the bank increase the money amount on the borrower's account without deducting that sum from any other account or their own reserves (except for some minimum reserve requirements) . If you checked the sum of all deposits before and after, you would see a difference - magic - that's the credit creation.

I am running a full node and see the same ratio and already on the physical limit (~700kbis/s) of my ADSL connection for upload. Upload speed seems to be THE critical bottle neck for the bitcoin network. If average block size rises twentyfold, I can serve only 2 peers (currently about 40). That would be no problem if more people were encouraged to run full nodes. On the other hand, if ISPs roll out 1Gbit/s symmetrical lines, I am fine with 1GB maximum block size.
Capping bandwidth could increase response time and make the node appear unreliable to others. It's better to limit connections.

Investing is essentially a zero sum game. If someone invests (buys stocks or real estate) someone else divests (sells stocks or real estate). It does impact economic activity only marginally.

1) The ATM limit is only for Greeks. Tourists can get up to their card limit and in addition they will bring more cash. Cash is the payment method No 1 in Greece, especially in the tourist industry (it is still doing very well).
2) Greeks started expatriating their money already years ago. Part of it is in foreign accounts in the EU, so they can purchase bitcoins online from a non-Greek bank account. In case of a Grexit, a deposit in any account in EU is not so safe anymore (they made extra EU law for a haircut) . In case of a default some Greeks might even fear temporary freezing of their accounts outside Greece, although that might be impossible by law.

Traders/investors can withdraw their funds 24/7/365 at virtually no cost quickly and the blockchain is very transparent. An exchange running fractional reserve would be at very high risk and it is illegal anyway. Just a rumor can trigger an exchange run and such a fraud would be exposed quickly. As a general rule never leave your funds on an exchange and deal in small installments only. This reduces your own risk and forces the exchanges to be honest.

Observed upstream traffic is on the physical limit of the DSL, because I am connected to about 50 other nodes causing this traffic (e.g. clients downloading blocks). If blocks/transactions go up 20x, I have no headroom for this additional data, thus my node performance goes significantly down (can serve less other nodes or distribute less blocks). The critical limitation is here not the bitcoin protocol (block size), but the bandwidth limit of the upstream channels of all nodes (since downstream channels are usually 5x-10x faster). I am not saying 20 MB blocks will break the system, but it will lead to less decentralization.

In theory, if MV=PQ was real, then a fixed supply would be no problem at all, since PQ is not limited by M. So you are contradicting yourself.
But this aside, because it is not a real model, we have to limit the economic growth anyway to a level below energy efficiency improvements, since we are already above capacity of the planet. Any real growth will destroy the human habitat, you just have to do the math at what growth rate we reach that level for sure.

Most of these calculation are wrong, because they don't factor in the halvings, but extrapolate linearly. 
E.g. after 4 halvings (= 1/16 of today's block reward), the electricity (not total energy) consumption could be at max 2% of total consumption, assuming total electricity production and prices stay constant over the next 16 years, mining equipment would be for free and they wouldn't make a penny in profits.
World's annual electricity production = 25PWh
Assumed electricity price for miners = $0.05/kWh
$650,000/BTC x 12.5BTC/block/16 x 144blocks x 365d = $27 billion max electricity cost per year
$27billion/$0.05/kWh = 0.53PWh annual electricity consumption by miners
0.53PWh / 25PWh = **2%**
If the electricity price for miners or world's electricity production go up, the number will be smaller. Adding other cost and profits, the percentage number gets even smaller.

The problem of Greece was too much debt in the first place, which is symptomatic for a fiat regime, since credit can be inflated at the discretion of politicians and is not linked to actual resources.

In haven't read the book, so I don't know the context of this statement. Unsound (easy) or un-pegged money is not the cause of debt spending. Debt has been existing for 5,000 years. There had been debt creation in gold/precious metal standards all over the place. The only difference is the rate at which the debt can be created. If money is not linked to a limited resource then it can be created at unlimited rate until the system collapses, since the debt load gets unsustainable at a certain point.

Of course this is ignoring the investment cost, but 7nm will be around for a longer time since the smaller nodes get close to a few atom layers, which creates much more challenges and causes way higher cost of process developement.

"Paper currency has two very distinct properties that should draw our attention. First, it is precisely the existence of paper currency that makes it difficult for central banks to take policy interest rates much below zero, a limitation that seems to have become increasingly relevant during this century ... If all central bank liabilities were electronic, paying a negative interest on reserves (basically charging a fee) would be trivial. But as long as central banks stand ready to convert electronic deposits to zero-interest paper currency in unlimited amounts, it suddenly becomes very hard to push interest rates below levels of, say, -0.25 to -0.50 percent, certainly not on a sustained basis.  Hoarding cash may be inconvenient and risky, 
but if rates become too negative, it becomes worth it."

Fiat is not a digital currency. Fiat money is only cash and for cash redeemable reserves wit the Central bank. "Digital Dollars" are simply claims or liabilities (IOUs) on money. A deposit is not money, it is a claim against a bank. If I transfer a "digital Dollar", I do not transfer money, I  transfer an IOU on money to someone else.  IOUs always inherit counter party risk with third parties (banks). The fact that there is way more claims on money than money exists, makes it a very risky system.

Marx defined the dictatorship of the proletariat for the implementation of socialism and communism as a requirement. The basic feature of socialism was the abolishment of private property beyond basic personal needs, because private property was seen as the root cause of exploitation of the working class. Only very small businesses with a hand full of employees were allowed in some countries, in others private enterprise was completely forbidden. The banking system was fully nationalized and investments were allocated by the government and paid through the printing press. Personal loans were made by state owned banks for private consumption only based on social standards. The banking system did not create credit out of collateral and there was no market for risk and interest rates at all. The socialist countries I grew up and had lived in for many years didn't start out as corrupt dictatorships. Leaders became corrupt at a later stage and that was one reason why these states failed. Still, the corruption was on a relatively small scale, not comparable with corruption experienced in the third world or even in the Western world nowadays.  
Something that US-Americans always get wrong: Sweden was never a socialist country, since it allows private property, private enterprises and operations for private profit at any scale (e.g. Ikea, H&amp;M are private multi-billion companies) and guarantees the rule of law. Sweden has a private banking system which creates credit out of collateral and has a market for risk and interest rates. Sweden is a full blown capitalist country and as capitalist as the USA. The difference is only the level of taxation, social welfare programs, social standards aso. but they exist in both countries.

In your example the problem occurs only, if the loan was paid out in cash. In general the cash reserves of a bank (mandated by law) are much lower, they are only a small fraction of the balances. The bank has much higher liabilities for money than they have money in their vault. From time to time this is tested during a bank run. Then banks have to borrow money from other banks and the central bank quickly (one reason they came up with the central bank as a lender of last resort) or go broke.

This is a very bad comparison. Bitcoin mining is not wasting energy, it is converted into cryptographic seals to secure the ledger and the ledger creates very useful utility for trade and commerce. In contrast, gas flaring is just completely wasted energy without any benefit, it does even harm the environment because of the massive carbon emissions. If the price of Bitcoin goes up enough, miners will use the flared gas for electricity or the oil industry become miners themselves (there are already some pilot projects).

Most of the calculation by those alarmists are wrong, because they don't factor in the halvings, but extrapolate linearly. 
E.g. after 4 halvings (= 1/16 of today's block reward), the electricity (not total energy) consumption could be at max 2% of total consumption, assuming total electricity production and prices stay constant over the next 16 years, mining equipment would be for free and they wouldn't make a penny in profits.
World's annual electricity production = 25PWh
Assumed electricity price for miners = $0.05/kWh
$650,000/BTC x 12.5BTC/block/16 x 144blocks x 365d = $27 billion max electricity cost per year
$27billion/$0.05/kWh = 0.53PWh annual electricity consumption by miners
0.53PWh / 25PWh = **2%**
If the electricity price for miners or world's electricity production go up, the number will be smaller. Adding other cost and profits, the percentage number gets even smaller.

Krugman claims fiat transaction cost are low. In reality the fiat payment systems cost us 2% of GDP, which is quite a huge amount in absolute terms. It makes the economy less efficient, payment cost are friction losses in an economy and eat up profits and revenue. 2% is about two thirds of annual growth rate, so current transaction cost are a real problem. Bitcoin can reduce that by at leat one order of magnitude.

His nationality is irrelevant. It all depends on Germany. If they say no to a bailout in one form or the other, then Italy has no other choice but to leave the Euro. Italy's economy is 10 times bigger than that of Greece, and their bailout negotiations took a long time and were on the brink of a collapse at least one time. Given its size, it will be much harder to create a bailout for Italy, especially when there is growing anti-euro sentiment in German politics. If Italy leaves the Euro it will be the winner in this case, since they owe the other member states almost half a trillion Euros. Germany will be the main loser, their claims become mostly worthless. As a consequence it is not in German material interest, that Italy leaves the Euro. But for Italy it has only advantages, politically as well as economically, so I would say there is a good chance that Italy really leaves the Euro.

Obviously you do not understand how the fiat system like the Dollar works. Somehow the money must be created and brought into circulation. But the government can't print it in order to pay back debt (bring it into circulation). It is illegal by law. Sure, they could so if the law was changed, but as I said it will be the nail in the coffin of it's own currency. The creditors will end up with negative real returns caused by inflation. They will disappear and the only way out is to print more money.

"The proletariat will use its political supremacy to **wrest, by degree, all capital from the bourgeoisie, to centralise all instruments of production in the hands of the State**, i.e., of the proletariat organised as the ruling class; and to increase the total productive forces as rapidly as possible.
Of course, in the beginning, this cannot be effected except by means of despotic inroads on the rights of property, and on the conditions of bourgeois production; by means of measures, therefore, which appear economically insufficient and untenable, but which, in the course of the movement, outstrip themselves, necessitate further inroads upon the old social order, and are unavoidable as a means of entirely revolutionising the mode of production.
These measures will, of course, be different in different countries.
Nevertheless, in most advanced countries, the following will be pretty generally applicable.
**1. Abolition of property in land and application of all rents of land to public purposes.**
2. A heavy progressive or graduated income tax.
**3. Abolition of all rights of inheritance.**
4. Confiscation of the property of all emigrants and rebels.
5. Centralisation of credit in the hands of the state, by means of a national bank with State capital and an exclusive monopoly.
6. Centralisation of the means of communication and transport in the hands of the State.
7. Extension of factories and instruments of production owned by the State; the bringing into cultivation of waste-lands, and the improvement of the soil generally in accordance with a common plan.
8. Equal liability of all to work. Establishment of industrial armies, especially for agriculture.
9. Combination of agriculture with manufacturing industries; gradual abolition of all the distinction between town and country by a more equable distribution of the populace over the country.
10. Free education for all children in public schools. Abolition of children’s factory labour in its present form. Combination of education with industrial production, &amp;c, &amp;c. "
From the Manifesto of the Communist Party by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels
When you can't own land, you can't even own a house. Communists consider ownership of means of production as the root cause of exploitation, therefore private property must be abolished. Abolishing all rights of inheritance means confiscation of all private property into the hand of the state. You can't even inherit a small house from your granny. I am not talking about personal belongings like refrigerators or automobiles. In the Soviet Union most of the housing was rented from the government, private agricultural land was collectivized forcefully and factories and equipment were confiscated. It was similar in most socialist countries, although some allowed very small scale private enterprise. Even in China the private ownership of means of production is a farce, since there is no rule of law. That's why they make centrally planned five year plans, because it is not a supply and demand market economy driven by owners of the means of production, but the real owners which is the state.

It's very obvious that increased resource consumption is caused by economic growth. The cause for it is the vicious cycle of credit creation in a fractional reserve system. Over time the credit created has to be increased, otherwise the system collapses (expansionary central bank policies are done exactly for that reason). When you have a monetary system which avoids this vicious cycle it's very obvious that the economy would grow slower or even stall, thus causing less resource consumption or even reduced resource consumption (through efficiency improvements) over time.

In the long term halvings will support higher prices without the need to increase the energy demand for mining. Also Bitcoin network energy consumption is tiny compared to the energy wasted in other industries. E.g. gas flaring (just burning because there is no use for it) in the oil industry wastes 30-times the energy compared to the energy to run the Bitcoin network. And not to talk about the carbon footprint of gas flaring. If the wasted natural gas was used with a conversion efficiency of 33%, the electricity could drive 10-times the hash rate we have now, theoretically supporting 10-times today's price.

A few misconceptions: A block PoW does not on only secure the transactions in the current block, but all transactions in the past and in the future. Also, LN allows massive scaling, which reduces the energy footprint of a payment by order of magnitudes. If compared to fiat based transactions one has to take into account the cost of maintaining a stable fiat system which requires the operation of an elaborated state ranging from extensive regulation to powerful military. PoS provides less security, since stakes could be obtained through force (e.g. confiscation of stakes of regulated stake holders) in worst case. Reduction of reward does reduces energy consumption only if the fiat price remains stable. In other words, the energy invested is a function of the product fiat price and reward, not only the reward in BTC units.
But don't worry, Bitcoin won't consume all energy of the planet, because it makes no sense economically. There will be an economic equilibrium for the power consumption long before that. It is a self regulating system that doesn't need a fix.

No, when you close the port, the node downloads blocks only (incoming connections only), but doesn't upload blocks to other nodes (since it is not accessible by other nodes).

I understand that the potential revenue is proportional to the stake, but profitability is a factor of an LN node's revenue. Even if there are big players, the entry barrier is low and almost everyone can run an LN node and collect fees. Of course, this is proportional to your stake, but which doesn't have to be huge, since LN is intended for micropayments mainly. There might be large transactions happen on the LN too, but the great  majority will be microtransactions, where nodes with a small stake can profit well. So there are multiple arguments against wealth redistribution to the unequal benefit of a few. There are much more profitable and better monopolization-able ways of making money in the Bitcoin industry. E.g. mining equipment manufacturing has way bigger issues with centralization and abuse of market power, especially when they protect their hardware with patents (e.g. ASICboost). Also buying a mining rig is lost money, while a stake is always refundable.

Naked shorting is selling shares which aren't in your possession yet. Delivery of shares is allowed at a later date, which can be even weeks or months and this process is not transparent at all (dealing between private brokers aka middlemen holding your shares for you). In contrast, everyone can directly withdraw Bitcoins at any time from an exchange without middlemen into a private wallet and this process is quite transparent (blockchain). An exchange allowing naked shorting Bitcoin would take huge risks of defaulting on your delivery request, since more Bitcoin were sold than can be delivered actually.

The Federal Reserve does not issue digital Dollars, it issues only paper notes. Only Dollars issued by the Federal Reserve is fiat money, but not a Dollar account balance with a commercial bank. They are not legal tender, but simply electronic or paper claims (IOUs) against the bank, private contracts ("pay me on demand") denoted in Dollars. Although these contracts can be transmitted digitally to another bank and used as payment, the banks still need to exchange Dollar notes (or for cash redeemable reserves) held with their central banks. There is plenty of literature available about the fiat monetary system. That even Krugman claims we have a "digital Dollar" stuns me or he is just joking.

BTC can never be shorted 'properly' because it is a completely new asset class, neither Gates nor Buffett have understood, otherwise they would not make such comments. 'Proper' shorting works only with assets which exist as IOUs and actual transfer of ownership is very slow. We all know that BTC is very different. BTC is like a local, physical gold market in that respect. In a local, physical market you can short gold only, if you really posses it and you have to deliver ultimately. You can't sell gold on paper and then let the buyers wait days or weeks on delivery. Nor will the buyers just accept a hard to verify warehouse receipt.

The claim that there is censorship on Reddit is completely retarded. It comes from people who never experienced real censorship. If your post gets moderated in one sub, you still have the opportunity to post it hundreds of other subs/platform/media. Censorship means, that your posts get "moderated" on a very wide scale by a powerful organization. The intention of censorship is to stop spreading the word, but this does never happen on Reddit. Although every sub has its rules which is the guideline for moderators, everyone is free to start his/her own sub with own or without rules. 
If certain people could really influence Reddit to overwrite moderators, then it will be easy for governments and corporations to do this. This would be really the end of free speech on Reddit. If Reddit went that way, it would make itself obsolete.

Pls don't confuse existence of debt in general and overall debt level of an economy. Both are different things and have different impact on an economy. 
I agree that increasing debt load decreases productivity of an economy as can be nicely seen on long term debt growth to GDP growth charts per example. 
But without any existence of debt there is very little incentive to increase productivity, since you need to produce for yourself only and have not to pay tribute to anyone (debt has also to be seen in a wider context, taxes as a form of debt you incur automatically without borrowing anything if you live in a state society).  
Debt is not a bad thing in general and essential for economic development, but for sure there is an optimum for the level like it is for any mechanism. Too much or to little are bad but there is a sweet spot in between which is the most productive. 
Debt is a product of civilization and cannot be avoided with intelligent species like humans as soon as they reach a certain level of cultural and technological development. Every borrowing from the future creates debt. In small, trusted communities it was common to buy something and promise to pay for it plus an interest later. The merchant makes a record and - voila - debt is created. Debt contracts were found on clay tablets from the Mesopotamian age about 5,000 years ago. Later debt got institutionalized with commercial lenders, banks, central banks aso.

Also consider that when buying shares in a soon to be available bitcoin ETF. Any stock is just a claim against a brokerage, who deposit your shares for your. The old days when you could get shares on paper or register them in your name so you could go directly to the issuer are mostly gone (with few exceptions). Also, if you have a margin account, the brokerage can lend your shares to short sellers. In addition it allows shady brokers to play dirty games like naked short selling. Patrick Byrne (Overstock) did a lot of research on that. That he became a Bitcoiner, is probably not a coincidence:

Any blocksize increase degrades the network performance as long as the physical network is not upgraded at the same rate as the blocksize. Therefore increasing blocksize has benefits, but also cost. I haven't seen a calculation on how much a 2MB blocksize changes the important merits of the network, but I guess 2MB is still an improvement, while 8MB or bigger blocks would degrade it (in terms of robustness of the network) more than it improves it.

With PoS you buy shares and then mine for free. These shares will be way more speculative, since they anticipate mining returns over a long period into a questionable  future leading to high price volatility. Since PoS shares are the virtual currency at the same time, they are much less useful as a currency.  In addition I think PoS is much more susceptible to corruption, cartels and fraud.

Cost efficiency will simply dictate the scaling solution, no matter what scaling politics demands. A decentralized system has a different cost structure than a centralized system. Centralized systems like Visa can easily afford recording e.g. 100k tx/s over 20 years, because they have a single central database (and only several mirrors/backups), but it's cost prohibitive for a decentralized solution like blockchain (cost is a multiple of nodes). Storing such a high volume of tx on a decentralized blockchain is simply inefficient, it makes sense to move transactions off the blockchain. Payment channel information does not need to be stored after a channel is closed, which makes it much more efficient in terms of storage usage.

The ETF operation will not have a big impact on transaction amount. Since the investors own paper and not bitcoin, I don't think there are segregated bitcoin addresses required. The fund only has to buy and sell bitcoins on a daily basis in order to reflect the created or voided shares during trading hours. They can do that in one single transaction (netting) on the blockchain in order to move coins to/from an exchange.

I don't think core devs have poor communication skills or lack of maturity, otherwise bitcoin would not be there where it is today. 
Core devs have just their own sophisticated opinions and judgements which do not necessarily match with every ones commercial interests. Why should they at all? It's the bitcoin businesses' problem, if they base their business on a freely available open source technology. It's not fair to criticize people for their work, if you don't pay them. If bitcoin businesses want to change the code, they are free to hire their own devs, which have "good communication skills and high level maturity".

And he obviously doesn't understand CO2 and the effects of efficiency. Thanks to modern technology we can burn magnitudes more fossil fuel into CO2 today than it would be ever possible with an economy based on steam engines only. Inventions and innovations made energy use more efficient and therefore cheaper. Use of machinery became accessible to more people and lead to more and new applications of fossil fuel use, therefore reducing the cost of coal/oil/gas/firewood extraction while increasing demand at the same time significantly. In a bottom line: energy efficiency leads to more energy consumption, sounds paradox, it is paradox. It's called Jevons Paradox, look it up.

There are several web services for leaving messages on the blockchain.

The same is true for any goods China exports, instead exporting BTC, they are exporting all the stuff you can buy in stores in US:  RMB-&gt;(electrical power, resources)-&gt;all the stuff-&gt;USD/EUR... ; That created their huge surplus and lead to accumulation of foreign currency holdings.
And I don't buy this capital outflow story via BTC, because it is not true:
- Buy BTC with RMB (RMB stay in China)
- Transmit BTC to US-exchange (no USD leave China)
- Sell BTC for USD (no RMB or USD have left China, no reduction of  foreign currency holdings)
I agree, it does not add to China's foreign currency holdings, but miners are located in China, they will save/keep some of the BTC in China. If you consider BTC as foreign currency it adds to their foreign currency holdings.

Their success depends on many factors:
* the Fed needs to issue Dollars on the R3 blockchain 
* new law and regulation must be enacted  
* those crypto Dollars must become legal tender, guaranteed by the fed (redeemable for Federal Reserve Notes) and the government (e.g. IRS must accept crypto Dollars as taxes) 
* Foreign banks must trust the United States 
Without the ability to transmit Dollars on the R3 blockchain it is more or less useless, because the banks don't trust each other and would essentially do barter only. Interbank lending is even deader than it was in 2009. Just take a look at this chart:  . So no way that banks give each other credit for longer than a nanosecond.

The artificial limit is given by the physical network infrastructure, not by the limiter, which prevents that the system brakes. 
There are physical reasons behind technical limits, like weight limits, speed limits, height limits passenger limit aso. They were not introduced because a dictator wants rule for his own interest, but because it would cause unnecessary cost and damage to the general society, if they were not in place.  
As you can see from the size of the occasional mempool bloatings, that a 2MB or 4MB block size limit increase will fix little to nothing and has high risk of braking the whole system. 
The argument of elitist thinking is ridiculous. Every system needs an economic foundation to get it working. Communism is not a solution, because it has no economic foundation, therefore it will fail.

Thanks for the video. I am working on my own script based solution, but found the following issue:
There are tens of hash functions out there and there will be added more in the future for sure. People will write their own hash functions. Some patent trolls could abuse it for "timestamp backdating" by simply picking a transaction from the past and producing their own hash-like algorithm in order to match a random transaction from the past. Then they could simply claim they did it all then, since their hash matches the transaction. The counter party or the judge had probably to prove that their "hashing" algorithm is a fake one, which could be very hard, if it's a sophisticated hack. At least it leaves some room for dispute.
To avoid all this and make it 100% waterproof, I simply include a documentation of the whole process in the file to be timestamped. If that is not possible, I put it in a separate file and tar it along with the file to be timestamped and then hash the tarball. The separate file could be a script documenting the process. Also, the used hashing algorithm should be named exactly (e.g. NIST standard xyz, part abc ... aso) to make it very clear. Or just add the computer script to the tarball which does the hashing. Or best do both.
Also, it does make it easier in case you have to reproduce it in court 20 years later.

It will be more than that. You need experts in different fields and tool licenses are not cheap (5 digit for a year for a simple front end verification tool and up to high 6 digits for a backend tool, prices are strictly confidential and depend on volume etc.). Then you need multiple licenses of most of the tools, because you need to do things in parallel to save time. Fab costs will be in the multi million range for 16nm. Instead of starting from scratch it will be more efficient to go to a design center. Design centers have all the experience and share the tools among projects. They can also share an MPW spot in a foundry for multiple projects, which reduces the fab costs further. If someone is really seriously interested, he should just get quotas from different design centers. It requires a good specification of the design (functions, complexity, speed, operating conditions etc.)

Fabless semiconductor vendors in the US like Apple, Qualcomm, NVIDIA, AMD, MediaTek, Marvell and Broadcom use mostly chip foundries in Taiwan and not US.

The design of a hashing chip is not rocket science. The biggest burden are the NRE cost for a chip, which is in the high double digit million to billion dollar range for leading edge technologies like 16nm.

It was not a $20 billion industry then. And it's not a double standard, standards depend on the significance of a product, which is quite different from 4 years ago. 
I could name you a lot of bug-free products which where sold in the millions and I was involved in. Just not software, but chip design, which are more or less complex software products thanks to design automation. There you don't have the luxury to provide hotfixes when a product is already in the production pipeline or in the field. Bugs cause usually losses in the millions and could even bankrupt a company, so you have to use just different standards. It's not impossible to design bug-free products, it just depends on the right methodology, skills and attitude.

Take the "international action" out and the proverb is still valid. 
| The argument here is that consumers are marginally (do you know what that means?) more likely to consume with marginally decreased saving bonuses.
Marginally - that is possible, but when the saving bonus goes from zero to minus there is an easy trick to keep the zero bonus: cash under the mattress. Negative rates are a completely different world. 
The root cause of economic growth is debt, in the last centuries mainly through the credit creation of private banks. But when consumers are already over-leveraged and have no additional property to give as quality loan collateral, then there can be little new credit created. Consumers are also indirectly over-leveraged through government debt (direct and indirect tax burdens). The industrial world sits in a debt trap, which can't be solved by monetary policy. Monetary policy is just kicking the can down the road. The solution is either forgive debt (which will wipe out savings at the same time) or find new property as collateral for new debt (which is hardly possible without stealing). So times will become interesting, especially in Japan.

You don't have the minimum understanding of the banking system. Banks don't transmit dollars or euros or yen from bank to bank, they exchange collateral and reserves with each other via central banks. Also banking is not an untrusted system.
@_date: 2016-01-17 23:34:53


The nature of the traditional banking system does not allow clearing for fiat within minutes. Entries in bank books are I.O.U.s on money, while cash and reserves with the central bank are money only. When money is transmitted over the traditional banking system, the central bank just reduces the reserves of bank A and increases the reserves of bank B or vice versa for the difference of the amounts between bank A and B = net clearing. Usually this happens only once a day. It gets more complicated when bank A and B are not with the same central bank (multiple settlements until cleared), e.g. different FRBs or international transfers. When the bank books are maintained electronically, either on a database or on a blockchain it does not speed up money transfers, since computers and software do not replace central banks. 
The only way that banks can speed up their settlements is by issuing their own R3 coin and bypassing the central bank system completely, but in the end they have to clear it for fiat again unless the public trusts this R3 coin like money, which is essentially an electronic cheque. In order to create trust, the R3 coin must represent value, so at least all R3 banks in the world must redeem it for cash within minutes. This requires that banks trust each other, which is not a constant but a variable (the interbank market collapses during a financial crisis). Another option would be public trading of the R3 coin, but trading would induce fluctuation of its fiat price and requires trust of market participants. Trust in turn requires an untrusted system, where the R3 banks cannot manipulate it. So as consequence we would end up using bitcoin.

There will be always demand for on-chain transactions because of better security and reduced complexity, with the effect that average on-chain fees will always be reasonable for miners. There will be a cost/risk trade-off for users on-chain vs LN. E.g. when fees go below 1 cent/tx  users will select the on-chain option, when they go above 10c/tx they will select the LN option. In average miners will at least collect 5 c/tx for small payment amounts. 
In addition, what stops the miners from operating lightning nodes/hubs and collect fees?

This argument makes no sense. An asset or currency with limited supply where you can't create it out of thin air, is harder to short, not easier.


The threat of a 51% attack is a s old as the White Paper. A 51% attack can only sabotage it for a while, but that comes with immense cost. Therefore it is economically more rewarding to mine than to attack Bitcoin.True, 51% attacks on alts happened, but the required resources for this are easily available and cheap. This is not the case for Bitcoin, you can't simply rent 51% of hashrate.   


Digital gold.


Which points? The paragraph in that linked book is just incompetent bla bla without any substance.


There are more than 15 mining pools with the biggest owning less than 15% hash rate. How is that centralized. In addition, the mining pools don't own the hash rate, but the miners do. Small miners point their hash to a pool, but they can switch to another pool quickly and will do that to avoid centralization. 


No, you do not trust, you verify. It's open source. if you don't like the code, you use other code or write your own. 


Facts please. While you can't avoid manipulation completely, there is no evidence that this is all fraud. BTW, gold markets are manipulated too.

Inflationary or deflationary money is not a choice, inflationary money is both an effect and necessity. Effect, because banks create new  "money" (actually credit) out of collateral. Necessity, because more new "money" is needed to pay back less old debt  (because savings/deposits(~~money supply) have no maturity date but debt has). A system with deflationary money is simply not sustainable, it will collapse quickly like a chain mail system with not enough input.
Creating credit is part of a market economy and symbolises freedom. Credit creation will always happen in civilization, even with Bitcoins, shells or gold nuggets. Money is only a fundamental tool for economic growth, but the root cause for growth is civilization. So sorry, the kind of "money" will not end or even inverse growth, only universal force or some kind of extreme religious consensus could.

I understand the effect of price inflation There can be monetary inflation aka "money printing" with low price inflation. There is enough evidence that the price inflation does not cancel out the monetary inflation automatically. Just look at historical M3 growth vs. CPI and compare that to gain in asset prices.
Monetary inflation leads to asset inflation, it's a fact and any economist would not deny this.

Authoritarian state capitalism is an oxymoron. Capitalism is the most efficient way of doing commerce. When you want to do efficient commerce, you need predictable property rights, otherwise any commerce will become a lottery. You need security if you want to invest into a business. How are predictable property rights enforced? By the rule of law, not by an authoritarian state, which just can seize property and redistribute it for any reason at any time. The foundation of capitalism is democracy and there is no in China. China does just emulate capitalism, but it will collapse when the authoritarian state acts too authoritarian again.

I am referring to total transaction fees. If blocks are not full and there is no backlog, fees collapse to the required minimum simply because there is no competition for space in a block. If blocks are always full and there is a backlog, fees rise simply because there is competition for space in a block. There is empirical evidence on that, just take a look at the blockchain. 
For sure there is an optimum blocksize which generates the highest total fees. Making blocks too small would reduce total fees. Making blocks too big would reduce total fees even more. So the optimum lies in between, but requires always full blocks and a backlog at least. 
Since miners act in their self interest and can control the blocksize with BU,  **the economics in a BU system will simply work against increasing transaction capacity in order to bring tx fees down.**

Bitcoin is a new paradigm, you seem to miss that completely. Bitcoins can be secured by of magnitudes more efficient than traditional funds. You just have to learn how, but then you don't need an expensive, inefficient custodian/bank/broker system for your funds anymore. You become your own bank, the Bitcoin users and business become the "banking" system without the need of having government regulations, guarantees and interventions. The cost of this system is significant, you just don't see it because they are taxing people in various subtle ways like fees, interest rates for credit, inflation, insurance premiums, taxes aso. Technology can get you rid of all that if you are willing to use it. Sure, that does not come for free and without any entry burdens, but if you invest a bit, mainly your own thinking, it will be way more efficient in the end.

If you follow the conversation another BU argument goes like "it is not a blocksize increase, because people fear to use it". How do they know, that people won't use it? That's pure speculation.

The result would be netting, not fractional reserve banking.

So would bigger blocks. If there is no block space scarcity and no competition for a place in a block,  which is the motivation behind bigger blocks, fees will drop to the required minmum.

Depends on the battery cost. At $100/kWh it might be different. Tesla claims their batteries cost is at $111/kWh, but at the moment you still have to pay $200/kWh for used (degraded) Tesla (Panasonic) 18650 cells, about $400 for new 18650. I am still waiting for the Battery glut when all those Gigafactories are up and running and enough electric cars have aged and need new batteries. Hopefully used ones will be available at scrap prices in near future. For stationary applications it doesn't matter if they have only 50% capacity left.

Hi BitPay Card users,
Every now and then we'll reach out to you to let you know about big things happening with your BitPay Prepaid Visa® account.
Right now the BitPay Card is scheduled for a system conversion, including upgrades to improve the systems that support your card. During the time of this conversion (starting March 8th), cash back features such as ATM withdrawals, POS cash back and over-the-counter cash advances will be unavailable. This service interruption is unavoidable, and we will make every effort to restore these services as soon as possible.
During the conversion, you will still be able to use your card to shop with Visa® merchants online and in-person. You will also continue to be able to move funds from your card to other bank accounts via ACH transfer. View our guide to ACH transfers.
We value and appreciate your continued use of the Card. If you have any questions about this notification, please contact us at  or call the cardholder services team at (855) 884-7568. We'll be reaching back out to you when cash back features are available again.

This is explains naturally why price goes up long term, how is that manipulation?
If you don't know why Bitcoin is different, then you have understood little. Sure, prices can be manipulated, no matter if with or without regulation. But in long term any manipulation comes to an end and the real price will persist. Fiat is going to zero long term, Bitcoin to the opposite. 
Bitcoin is based on math and cryptography, not a conspiracy theory. That the author of that book tries to put it that way, it just demonstrates his incompetence. He just cherry picks even justified arguments of the fiat critics including gold bugs, brands them as conspiracy theories (which is easy when you just cherry pick) and claims that this is the foundation of Bitcoin. No, that is only very cheap demagogy. Of course, personally you have the freedom to believe that or not.

I agree, there are people trying to manipulate the fiat price on exchanges like in any market, but the claim those efforts are centralized is pure speculation and accusation. Otherwise please provide evidence about that. 
Even with gold and silver you can't prevent price manipulation, although it is harder. It is even harder with Bitcoin, because manipulators cannot exploit fractional reserve schemes, because they are very dangerous. Gold and silver is even easier to control by governments, since it requires physical representation. In contrast, Bitcoins can be transmitted worldwide without that any government can censor transactions. 
The biggest price manipulators are actually central banks these days, but this even works in favor of Bitcoin. 
I agree, the fiat monopoly enables abuse and manipulation. People should be free to decide the currency they want to use.

No need to resize your partitions. Ubuntu can read/write your Windows partition. If there is enough space:
       Specify data directory
Or, as already mentioned, run it in pruning mode:
  -prune=&lt;n&gt;
       Reduce storage requirements by pruning (deleting) old blocks. This mode
       is incompatible with -txindex and -rescan. Warning: Reverting
       this setting requires re-downloading the entire blockchain.
       (default: 0 = disable pruning blocks, &gt;550 = target size in MiB
       to use for block files)
Relaying tx is imho more important than storing the whole blockchain. 
You can also run it on Windows (in case you need your Windows for other work).
I mention Ubuntu only, because old laptops have older Windows versions, which can't be upgraded for free, while Ubuntu is for free. In addition, you can install Ubuntu server, which reduces resource requirements (especially if you have an older laptop).

Circulation does nothing long term to the economy, it just wobbles economic activity. There is no longtime correlation between economic growth and money velocity, this can be verified by looking up monetary statistics with the Federal Reserve. Only increase in credit through credit creation by commercial banks leads to economic growth. **Per simple math and logic money circulation cannot increase credit, "circulation" or the money velocity theory is just a scapegoat argument.** There is no economic reason to keep money circulating, the only reason behind the "circulation" argument is that money needs to be deposited with commercial banks, otherwise, if money is stashed under mattresses, the system will experience a liquidity crisis and finally implode, since the banks will run out of reserves and cannot cover their liabilities. This is a consequence of fractional reserve banking (which is actually a wrong, misleading description, since in some jurisdictions there isn't even a reserve requirement at all, e.g. Australia), where the liabilities of the banks is a multiple of their reserves or there are even zero reserves. **The only reason to have inflation is to keep money deposited with commercial banks in order to prevent the system from imploding.**

Banks-to-governments lending has nothing to do with interbank lending. Also banks do not lend to the government, they purchase bonds issued by the government, since they have to maintain stable reserves by regulation and want to maximize profits (government bond interest rates are always higher than the central bank funds rates).
During every financial crisis banks turn to the lender of last resort, the central bank. Providing liquidity to banks is one function of the central bank, but it shifts the risks on the tax payers. If a bank defaults with the central bank, the part which cannot be recovered through asset sales must be balanced. It can mean negative income for the government , since the income from central bank lending proceeds might not cover the loan losses. 
You can look central bank lending up on the Federal Reserve webpage (sorry, I don't have a link right now).

1) is close, but it also depends on the productivity of debt. E.g. if a lot of loans are created, but these loans just drive up house prices and do not stimulate construction or consumption, economic growth remains zero.  
Government does not control interest rates. In capitalism interest rates are negotiated on a market (e.g. government debt auction) based on many factors like risk of default, price inflation aso. Central banks and governments can only try to influence that, but as long they do not abolish the market economy, they cannot control it.
Governments can create economic growth through spending, that is true, but governments are the worst businessmen for various reasons (get an infinite credit line, can socialize losses aso.). That's why all state economies fail in the end. You need the privates dominating commerce, since only private accountability creates the most efficient economy.
2) &amp;  3) is a variation of the money velocity argument, maintained by many economic schools. This argument is bogus, since there is no empirical evidence for sustainable economic growth based on money velocity.  There are short term effects (e.g. consumers advance spending), but this is very inelastic and strikes back.

Liquidity crisis are an extremely amplified problem in a fractional reserve system, because defaulting loans threaten wipe out the reserves which makes a bank bankrupt and wipes out all the depositors money with it. This causes panic, bank runs and ripple effects, market prices in risk and interest rates explode, bringing the debt rollover into jeopardy. 
In contrast, in a full reserve system savings are pledged for a full term of a loan, which avoids all the ripple effects. Loans can default too, but this doesn't wipe out the reserves. Savers might lose money, but they will be more careful with pledging their money for a loan. I agree, in a full reserve system a liquidity crisis can occur too, but the consequences are way less severe than in a fractional reserve system.
@_date: 2019-03-14 23:12:22

Inflation doesn't buy things, debt does.

That is correct only to a certain degree. Banks borrow cash from the Federal Reserve only in order to satisfy the cash needs of their customers, which is only a small fraction of the money supply. The interest rate banks charge to their customers for loans depends on market conditions. It can be lower or higher. Also, the treasury interest rates are discovered in a market. This is by no means controlled by the central bank. The Federal Reserve is even more re-acting than acting in terms of interest rates. When the treasury yield falls below the federal funds rate, they have to lower the federal funds rate, otherwise the banks would return their borrowings from the Federal Reserve, which squeezes liquidity from the economy or they could go bankrupt by eating up reserves through the negative rate spread. On the other hand, when market interest rates are way higher than the federal funds rate, banks' reserves grow faster through the positive rate spread. This encourages more lending and leads to inflation, which the Federal Reserve has to counter by increasing the federal funds rate. As you can see, the Federal Reserve doesn't control the market rates, it can just try to influence them, but in reality it is more re-acting than acting.


It's an exaggeration indeed, commercial banks create credit out of collateral, to be precise, but for the privates it looks like money is created out of thin air in the end. 


It is done via buying assets (QE) or take assets as collateral in order to issue cash to the banks, not through interest rates. As I explained, they can try to influence that, but they do not control that process.


The borrowings from the Federal Reserve are tiny compared to the overall credit market. For borrowing from the Federal Reserve banks need acceptable collateral, but this is only a small fraction of all assets in the economy. 


This is oversimplified. Banks need reserves in order to create loans. If banks have no reserves, they can't create credit. The Federal Reserve cannot gift the banks reserves. If privates won't take out loans, banks are unable to create credit. The "n" is a minimum regulatory requirement only, it is not given that this "money multiplication" really happens, no matter how much the government spends. "Money multiplication" is also a misleading description, since you can't multiply money, but you can only create money to make up (create) for the difference in reality, which commercial banks do by credit creation.


Secondary spending is all a money velocity argument. I havn't seen any data in the Federal Reserve statistics that support any of those arguments. Only the credit creation growth grows demand sustainably.

It's not loans, but repos. The balance sheet (net amount of money that was printed) increases as can be seen in the publicly available statistics of the Federal Reserve. E.g., the Fed buys an asset and sells the asset again the next day (overnight repo), the printed money gets destroyed again - that is correct, but if the amount of repos increases day by day, the balance sheet increases.

You just need a handful of engineers do tape out an ASIC. And of course some money, the biggest cost burden are masks. For 16nm it is not cheap, but for a venture capitalist it is peanuts.   
The design complexity is not a challenge at all when you compare it to SoCs (mixed signal, memory) which go into cheap cell phones. A sha256 algorithm is a simple synchronous digital design and the operating  conditions are very relaxed. The algorithm is not a secret nor is it protected by IP rights. The design is already open source, it just needs to be mapped on a 16nm or below process. Engineering will be a very streamlined process.

You have to make the distinction between resource limited, p2p money and debt based money, which can be created out of "thin air". Private money can be debt based "out of thin air" money too, while government money could be resource limited, p2p money as well.
The simple reason for exponential growth in a debt based "out of thin air" money system is that banks can create credit out of collateral, which increases the money supply substantially and leads to economic growth. Money velocity and other human factors do not, these are misconceptions of most economic theories. 
With a resource based, p2p currency like Bitcoin, creation of credit out of "thin air" will be very limited to impossible. Increasing the money supply requires trust, depositors and the ability to create base money out of "thin air" (printing notes against government debt) as well. All this is not required or given with Bitcoin, Bitcoin holders are not required to make deposits with a third party, because additional utility would be very marginal and comes with drawbacks like counter party risk. In addition, Bitcoins cannot be created out of thin air, it involves cost and creation cannot even increased at will, since this is controlled by an consensus algorithm. As we know Bitcoin creation even slows down over time (halving). 
It is true that there will be lending with Bitcoin, but it will be a full reserve system (someone pledges his savings for the full term of a loan to someone else). This makes credit creation out of "thin air" impossible. Although you can't prevent credit creation in commerce at all, it might happen with Bitcoin too, but to a very limited degree and will have an negligible impact on economic growth.

I know, but banks still need deposits in order to make new loans (by regulatory requirement). If a bank creates a loan and pays that out, it has to borrow the cash from the Federal Reserve, other banks or other customers (since a bank can create credit or deposits, but not the cash). Since deposits coming in each day, it is a minor problem for the bank. But with Fedcoin it would be different. Most Fedcoins would cirulate in the public and be stored on thumb drives, paper or brain wallets. All banks would end up with little deposits and they could borrow the Fedcoins from the Federal Reserve only, where they had to provide collateral to the Federal Reserve in the amount of nearly all outstanding loans. Then a bank needed own capital in the amount of the required collateral in order to buy acceptable collateral (treasury notes). In bottomline it means means banks need own capital in nearly the same amount of the loans they make (the margin for credit creation would be extremely thin). As I said a Fedcoin would put our monetary system upside down.

Repo was dead since the financial crisis in 2008 and was just re-started in 2019 again. Controlling the overnight rate wasn't done this way between 2008 and 2019, because repo was simply not required anymore, since QE was a more efficient way to do it. Banks could just sell their collateral to the Fed and not just for a one night repo. Now the Fed led the balance sheet shrink and that led to a liquidity crisis, that's why rates spiked. The Fed had to start repos as emergency measures. To save face, because they couldn't just re-start QE. Now added longer term repos fill the void (there are repos into 2020 available now). They just don't call it QE, but it is effectively QE. The bottom line is, they have to increase the balance sheet (which is effectively money printing), as soon as they tried to shrink it, the system runs into a liquidity crisis. There will never be a normalization, money printing is the new normal.

It will never happen because it would destroy the private banks. A government crypto is incompatible with fractional reserve banking. It would just lead to a giant bank run.

So true, but it's not a reason for failure. There is so much evidence in history that suboptimal technologies almost always succeeded over later perfect ones, because they were so revolutionary and therefore were adopted quickly. The cost to replace it by a later perfect technology isn't covered by the gain. Only another revolutionary new technology compared to Bitcoin will replace it one day.

Investing is just another form of saving money. Investing as driver of the economy is a myth, actually bogus economics taught at too many schools. Banks do not lend deposits.

A commodity backed currency can cool this insanity significantly down.

No president can ever fix it, because it is an inherent problem of a debt based monetary system. Debt grows always faster than GDP, because there is always unproductive debt.

In theory it would not be irrevocable, since it is fiat. The issuing power can abuse it, since it controls the blockchain. But the same is true for existing cash. The issuing power can just make/declare notes and coins worthless (not accepting for tax payments any more), which happened a lot in history. It destroys trust in its currency immediately. So a government  better never does this, even never has such thoughts, if it wants a stable currency. The same would be true for a "Fedcoin" (issuing tokens instead of notes and they would be transferable on a blockchain). But for the reason I stated (commercial banks need the deposits instead of having virtual cash circulating only in the public) this is very unlikely to happen. Governments even think of a cash ban, because there is little incentive to deposit money with a bank at the currently low interest rates.

It depends on the perspective of view. As long as it doesn't blow up the system right now, it's fine. But as the ratio gets worse, it will hit a ceiling at a certain point and then the debt system system will collapse, because it can survive only through expansion. Then it is really bad. 
Also, the higher the debt load, the less productive new debt becomes (empirically proven). To expect another industrial revolution that saves us all is a great illusion. Only a debt moratorium would enable that.

This is not how modern banking works. Commercial banks do not loan deposits. They create new credit out of collateral, but this newly created credit must come back as deposits (because the amount of outstanding credit is a multiple of the available currency ~~in~~ for circulation), otherwise they go bust. Banks need incentives for the public for depositing money: constant currency devaluation, security and utility. With Bitcoin there is no big incentive for depositing coins into a bank. Modern banking simply won't work with Bitcoin. If Bitcoin becomes the backbone of the economy, commercial banks will disappear for the most part or become essentially shadow banks, servicers, payment processors aso.

You are mixing up liquidity with demand. 
If someone buys, someone else sells. Money changes hands, it does not disappear when it is spent. In the end there must be always someone who is hoarding, no matter if fiat deposits or Bitcoin. There are currently about 20 trillion Dollars hoarded in checking/savings accounts and CDs. You can't get simply away from that, no matter how the money looks like. Motivation to spend through inflation has no long term effects on the economy as proven by empirical evidence. The only thing what is driving the economy is debt and demand for necessities. Debt/lending does not require a devaluing fiat currency, debt/lending is as old as civilization.

That statement is incomplete. Our financial system is based on ledgers **and collateral**. Those ledger entries would be worthless without the control over the collateral documented in the ledger. Collateral has always to follow the ledger entry and that is complex and time consuming. The beauty of Bitcoin is that ledger and collateral are the same thing, which is revolutionary. Separating that by just using the blockchain technology has no significant advantage.

When the block reward is divided in half, the miners make half the money (assuming price stays the same), so they can afford only half the electricity. For sure the price does not stay the same, it fluctuates. In case the price doubles after a halving, they can afford only the same amount of electricity as before the halving. No matter how you turn it, the halving has a clear affect on electricity consumption. Any linear extrapolation is dead wrong. You can see that effect in this chart:

The big concept is that an energy limited currency will limit overall energy consumption. Bitcoin's money supply does not expand exponentially like fiat systems do and money/credit supply or debt growth is the root cause for all economic expansion. In addition the fiat system depends on economic expansion, if it is not maintained the fiat system will collapse. A world without or low growth is not beneficial for the economy itself but for mankind in the long term. The economy can't grow another 200 years like it grew the last 200 years even if we had a clean and safe source of energy and would not pollute the environment, simply because law of physics dictate that the dimension of future energy consumption will make the planet uninhabitable.   
The biggest economic disaster of mankind is not use of energy but the dimension of its use and, even worse, the infinite exponential expansion of its use. Limiting the view on energy consumption of Bitcoin without its effects on overall energy consumption in the long term is very misleading. I understand why growth and fiat maximalists like the Keynesian church is totally upset about this, but mankind has no choice but abandon this economic system for a more sustainable one.

The Dollar isn't simply numbers in a computer. Bank deposits are, but this is not money, but claims on money. Money is notes and coins as well as reserves of the banks with the central bank. The Federal Reserve cannot cover any shortfall, they have to back issued currency with eligible collateral, e.g. treasury notes. If a bank borrows money from the Federal Reserve, they have to deposit collateral with them. Reserve ratio essentially defines the amount of liabilities vs. cash reserves of a commercial bank.

If that is the case (strong support for SW because of the benefits), why not add a blocksize "hook" to that release, which allows to control the blocksize and will be activated at a later date. 
The scenario is the following:
Nodes which switch to SW, blocksize increases later -&gt; for them it is no hardfork.
Nodes which do not upgrade to SW, blocksize increases later -&gt; for them it is a hardfork. 
Assuming: number of SW-nodes &gt;&gt; number of non-SW-nodes -&gt; fork of the blockchain is very unlikely. 
blocksize "hook" means just a minimum implementation which allows to change the blocksize. The precise mechanism can be defined at a later date. 
I think this strategy takes the "horror" of a hardfork completely out. There are still small risks, but any upgrade has some risks in general.

Also it has to be taken into account that interest rates are historically low and the government effectively doesn't pay interest on about $3 trillion debt, because the interest on the federal debt held with the Federal reserve is paid back to the government.

Theoretically yes, but in reality it's not that easy:
"Now theoretically, it is true that you can convert your GLD shares to physical gold and take delivery of it. But practically, you can't. For one thing, you have to be approved to do so (generally meaning, you're either a broker or a market maker), and then you have to redeem a minimum of 100,000 shares. And even if you meet those qualifications, buried in the firm's prospectus - a very tough read, by the way, but you can get a copy at their website if you want to try your luck - is a provision stating that they have the option of redeeming such shares in cash equivalent rather than bullion.
This is to say: If there is a sudden run on physical gold, GLD is not contractually obligated to provide actual metal, in exchange for however many shares, to anyone."

First, commercial banking with credit creation has been done for centuries, long before Wall St existed. 
It seems, you do not fully understand the process. After the bank has given out $100m in loans, the majority comes back as deposits. It does not stay in nirvana. So it increases the deposit balance of the bank by maybe $95m (only a small fraction stays in circulation). In addition, the increased loan amount of the bank creates profits from interest revenue on those loans, which bolsters their cash reserves (since interest comes in as cash). This allows them to create more loans next time, and a commercial bank is never done. This process has been repeated over and over again for centuries. Some of the oldest banks existed even before America was discovered. The only question is, where the additional cash in this system comes from, since the bank needs to satisfy the regulatory reserve requirements. The bank's reserves today are not held as not interest bearing and devaluing cash in a vault (which would be economic suicide), but invested in interest bearing treasury notes. Banks simply have no choice, but to buy government debt with their reserves, and the government is happy to have a buyer for their debt notes. And the bank brings the debt notes to the central bank and gets freshly printed cash notes for that (either borrowed or sold=QE) thus increasing the monetary base. For that proces a government and a central bank is required only, but not a Wall St. They simply became middleman over the last 100 years, getting their "fair" share of this process.


Right, this is just a number in their books, not money. There is no money in the bank in that amount. But this is just a regulatory detail in order to somehow guide and stabilize this process, it does prevent increasing the monetary aggregates. 


When a bank creates a loan, it pays it out and the debtor can buy real goods with that. This is nothing else than credit creation out of collateral, not out of deposits, since the deposits of the other customers are not reduced or blocked.

It was not due to the effects of a lost war solely, but the decision of the German government to print their way out of debt (reparations they had to pay) and do massive government spending for social programs because of economic crisis. In the end it doesn't make a difference how the debt was accrued and US is not prone against economic crisis as well. Assets can be confiscated (e.g. Executive Order 6102), so it doesn't help the individual people but the government only. I agree, such a scenario is very unlikely because of the global reserve status of the US Dollar in the near future. Weakening of other currencies will strengthen the US Dollar relatively or "in the country of the blind the one-eyed man is king".

"Repurchase" ... something different than a loan. Banks can borrow cash from the Federal Reserve as well, from a different window. Then why would they do repo in addition? 


They could also sell the 3.5 trillion QE collateral. Which would crash the markets. There is a reason why they hike the balance sheet with  money printing. That a repo is collaterized doesn't make a big difference, since the collateral was bought with printed money too. It is just a circular sheme.

Out of thin air is indeed an exaggeration. Essentially banks create credit out of collateral, which means, a buyer pledges the asset he buys to the bank (they become the title holder) and put the value into the assets column of their books, while they put the credit amount in the liability column of their books on the same line. The credit they create is just a number and a deposit for the debtor, but actual money was never taken from somewhere else. This is how banks can increase the money supply without actually borrowing money from the central bank or someone else (this would be technically impossible anyway, because the amount of bank deposits is a multiple of money in existence). The reserve requirements make it a little more complicated, but this is only a small fraction or even zero (depending on jurisdiction) of the credit they create.

Fiat (latin) means "It shall be". It is enforced by a government as legal tender through law, order or decree. The notion, that fiat means primarily "without intrinsic value" is dead wrong, since many currencies during the gold standard were legal tender or even gold was defined as legal tender. It can have intrinsic value, but not necessarily, so this definition does not hold. Unfortunately gold bugs vandalized those Wikipedia entries.
   
In case of the Petro, it is fiat, since the government forces its citizen to use it. Without Petros you can't get certain government services like a new passport. The Petro itself has no intrinsic value, the private key is not linked to physical oil. It is just a promise by the government, which can be broken at anytime. And for sure it will be.

I meant something different probably. User A and B set up a pair of payment channels, negotiate rate,  increments and total amounts. Then they start the exchange. In case A or B is dishonest, the maximum loss is the increment. If the increment is very small, the loss can be neglected and the exchange becomes essentially trustless. In this case existing and proven payment channel implementations can be used and the exchange mechanism put on top is extremely simple to implement.

Only individuals can prevent hoarding but not the economy as a whole. The theory of money velocity is bogus, since there is no empirical evidence that it grows the economy. Only credit creation can.

The same is true for exchanging Dollars on the black market, Yuan stays in China too, only Dollars will leave the country (or at least taken out of circulation in order to prevent confiscation). Dollars become scarce, therefore the price for Dollars is rising (or Yuan is falling). 
That Yuan is staying and other currencies are leaving IS actually the problem, because it impacts the exchange rate. That's why the PBOC is concerned about these secondary markets, because they could lose control of the Dollar exchange rate, if these markets became too big and influential. With the Bitcoin surge, the Dollar was about 10% more expensive on Chinese Bitcoin exchanges indirectly. That might have been the main reason why the PBOC stepped in. After the "inspection" the Dollar premium is gone, now there is even a discount.

Paying rent in Bitcoin is also possible with a Shift debit card, in case the landlord doesn't want use a payment processor. Also, the volatility is a problem of any traded asset, this is not specific to Bitcoin. If you paid in gold or silver, payments would face the same problem. Also prices for merchants are volatile too, they can change multiple times a day, e.g. for gas stations. Still, selling gas is an established business, although the gas price is volatile.

Even a strong legal system doesn't help the banks to enforce repayment of a loan. It's completely legal to default on a loan = bankruptcy laws. Even if the law enforced all debt repayments, it would be fruitless if the debtor is bankrupt. During an economic crisis incomes and asset valuations go down, but not the loan amount. This widens the potential loss for a creditor. Creditors get cold feet and reduce loan creation, amplifying the economic crisis and more money gets destroyed through loan repayments than created through new loans (deflationary trend sets in). Only a fraction of defaulting loans can wipe out the bank reserves completely (fractional reserve), the bank goes bankrupt. Bank bankruptcies amplify the credit crunch until a total liquidity freeze. We are talking about $233 trillion of outstanding debt here, the multiple of the worlds annual GDP combined. It is a self-reinforcing system to the downside and a major flaw of a debt based fiat system. Roubini as a "leading economist" should rather address this instead of bashing crypto like a five year old.

Sorry, but you compare a claim transfer with transfer of real funds. A credit card transaction in seconds is just a claim transfer, money still needs to be moved which takes up to two weeks.

This process doesn't change the money supply. Only the Federal Reserve is allowed to bring new money into circulation.

Description via Google translate:
The Darknet - A journey into the digital underworld
It is a dark world where you have to know how to be encrypted and anonymous on the Internet: Darknet. Play area for drug dealers, arms traders and child molesters. But also a refuge for journalists, whistleblowers and politically persecuted in many countries of the world. Through the increasingly comprehensive digital surveillance, the Darknet is a necessity for people living in more and more autocratically governed countries of the world.
Meeting with drug dealers and gunmen
Annette Dittert has gone on a journey to get to know the bright and dark side of this digital parallel universe. She meets the Drogendaler, who is a 45-year-old family father in real life; The gunmaker, who was caught by special police investigators after making mistakes in sending the goods and the man who helps criminals with their expertise to deal with illegal transactions in the Darknet through encryption and anonymisation. 
The Darknet has changed the criminal underworld. But the other side is also gearing up. The BKA is investigating more and more hidden investigators in the hidden net, more and more often they come across the trafficking of the criminal underworld, which clearly confuses the scene.
Darknet technologies in the fight against the IS
In Istanbul, Annette Dittert meets the journalist Baris Pehlivan, whose computer was infected by the Turkish government with a Trojan that played incriminating documents on his hard drive. The journalist was then sentenced to 19 months' imprisonment. Only when a computer specialist found the Trojans, Baris Pehlivan came back free. The Syrian journalist group "Raqqa is being slaughtered silently" uses Darknet technologies to report on atrocities in the IS-Hochburg.
Support for threatened journalists and human rights activists 
These journalists and whistleblowers are supported by a small group of digital specialists, called "White Hat Hacker". Annette Dittert meets one of them, who has never been in front of television cameras: Claudio Guarnieri. He has been traveling around the world for years to provide tuition in digital security to threatened journalists and human rights activists.
In China, Annette Dittert learns that the Darknet has long since been taken by party patrons. In Iceland she visits a Bitcoinfarm, where the digital currency of the Darknet is "gnawed" in huge computer farms.
Conclusion: The Darknet is on the one hand the home of a criminal underworld, but on the other hand, it is also a last resort and shelter for many people in a world where governments invest billions to fully monitor their citizens. Annette Dittert's research in the Darknet is a journey through a new world.

I did in 2013 before buying my first coins. I was very skeptical about it and wanted to fully understand it before throwing my money at it. Over time the better I understood it (the white paper does not explain all the issues) I got more confident on it. I recommend to start with the white paper first and try to understand this, otherwise please don't bother about Bitcoin at all. You don't have to understand the math behind it, accepting the properties of concepts like digital signatures is sufficient.

Sure, you can provide tons of liquidity to mask the errors of the financial industry and not punish them = abolishing accountability for business decisions, which was the core mechanism in market capitalism once. But this way you make it worse. The economy becomes a Zombie capitalism, since all bad businesses are kept alive instead of letting them die a natural death.

And there were two types of passports. The ones that allowed you to leave East Germany to West Berlin or West Germany where available only to state-loyal celebrities (singer, actors, writers etc) for business, because they came back and had to turn in most of their D-Mark earnings. Possession of D-Marks were illegal for the ordinary citizen, if they got some from family and friends from the West, they had to exchange them for coupons which could be used to buy Western goods in special government owned stores. Nevertheless  D-Marks circulated on the black market. Many rare or normally unavailable goods like cars, spare parts, building materials, Japanese electronics or computers were traded for D-Marks.

Not at all, they are not there, because it is technically impossible, since the amount of all cash and bank reserves with the central bank is only a fraction of all deposits. Only the reserves are there. When you spend from your deposit balance with your VISA debit card or check, the bank of the merchant claims Dollars from your bank and the merchant considers your purchase as paid and hands you out the merchandise. If your bank is really able to transfer Dollars to the merchant's bank, is a completely different question. Also the transfer of Dollars does not happen instantly, but with delays of many days. As long as the merchant trust its bank and the banks trust each other, bank deposits have the function of money, but they are not money.

Although it remains fiat = centralized and trusted, it has many advantages. E.g., it would make fiat-crypto exchange easier, it could even automate exchanges (quasi-trustless p2p exchange).
But I doubt, that the owners of the Federal Reserve, the midlemen aka commercial banks, will allow to circumvent their storage and transaction services. Without substantial deposits our banking system would not work, so it is actually a no-go.

The institutional money totally missed that, it became dumb money, because the smart individuals already went in a long time ago. If the dumb money now trying to get control over it with questionable methods, e.g. abuse of power aka cartels, they are undermining  Bitcoin's meritocracy, which is the foundation of this revolution. They not noticing that they are actually destroying it, but maybe that is their actual goal.

Bank runs didn't end this practice. Central banks were initiated by those private banks in order to get bailed out by the central bank in case of a bank run. That was the main motivation behind it. Fractional reserve dates back to Marco Polo's age and allowed banks to create credit at a faster rate, thus growing their revenues and profits faster. I have nothing against such a business attitude. It enabled the industrial revolution, which funded ventures including technological development (inventions) and gave us the modern live style we have now. The problem with fractional reserve is, that it needs exponential growth in order to sustain, but exponential growth can never be sustainable in a world with limited resources.

*The dollars on our financial institution statement, viewed online, are considered real money, even though those are just digital dollars.*
Dollars on the account statement are an IOU on money, not digital dollars. The IOUs are recorded in computer databases today while they were recorded in the bank's book before the computer age. Just the way it is recorded does not make them digital Dollars. 
*In the 1630s people in Holland thought of tulip bulbs as stored value.  Tulips were desired, giving tulip bulbs value.  But over time people acquired tulip bulbs not to plant, but rather for the stored value they represented.  As more people bought bulbs, and put them in a drawer, the price was driven higher, until 1 tulip bulb was worth 10 times the typical annual salary of a Dutch worker - and worth more than entire houses.  People thought the value of tulip bulbs would forever go up.*
Author should educate himself about the tulip bubble. People did not buy tulip bulbs as store of value, but they traded tulip future contracts which lead to extreme speculation. Essentially it was a future mania enabled by a very efficient banking system for the time and inflow of gold.  
*Someone could hack the blockchain, create more Bitcoins*

Many exchanges are regulated. In addition these groups had to manipulate many exchanges and markets at the same time, it is not as easy as to manipulate a stock on the NYSE. 
*Or Bitcoin users could simply start using other crypto-currencies or traditional government issued currencies* 
Or Dollar users could simply dump the Dollar and use Bitcoin. 
*stay away from Bitcoins.  They have no inherent value*
Author doesn't understand it, but already knows it is shit.
*The Bitcoin currency is not managed by any government agency, nor is it backed by any government.  Bitcoin values are purely dependent upon holders having faith they will continue to have value.*
No, Bitcoin depend on math which defines an immutable ledger, while governments can manipulate their ledgers for their own advantage.

"When I buy coffee with my Visa card on Apple Pay, the transaction takes me 3–5 seconds from intent to pay to transaction completion" 
Depends what you define as a transaction completion. A VISA transaction clearing for cash take up to to weeks. Many things can go wrong, and they do. This gets fixed by the middlemen and paid by the users of the system.
"...and there is exactly zero fees I need to pay."
Fees are paid by the cc users via exorbitant interest rates and by the merchants.
"With Bitcoin today, it could take me up to 20 minutes to be reasonably sure my transaction is complete and I might pay anywhere from 10 cents to 10 dollars in fees."
That is equivalent to an irreversible clearing for cash. A comparable system would be the RTGS of the Federal Reserve, which is quite expensive and works only within the US.

No, the government creates money (the treasury, more specifically the Bureau of Engraving and Printing prints the notes) and the Federal Reserve issues those notes to banks against collateral. The government is simply not allowed to issue them, although the money is government money and not private money.


Sorry, this is completely wrong. The government auctions bonds to private investors. Banks need to buy treasury bonds in order to provide collateral to the central bank in exchange for cash or they keep them there as reserves. Even with QE the Federal Reserve isn't allowed to buy from the government directly, they have to buy them on the secondary market from privates. 
Also the government does not deposit dollars in a commercial bank, maybe government institutions as account customers do this in order to pay bills. 
A bank does not lend money, it creates credit. When a bank creates a loan, it just writes a number on the balance sheet. The bank has to provide only enough reserves mandated by the reserve ratio in order to stay a solvent bank. When the loan amount gets transferred to another bank, banks exchange their reserves at the central bank. Only if a customer demands cash withdrawal, the bank has to borrow money from the Federal Reserve and provide collateral for it. 


There seems to be a lot of misinformation spread by the Fed.
Empirical evidence proves that the fractional reserve theory of banking does not hold true: *" The money supply is created as ‘fairy dust’ produced by the banks individually, "out of thin air"."*
*Can banks individually create money out of nothing? — The theories and the empirical evidence*

1) Gold is never involved, private investors pay with cash.
2) Banks need cash in order to buy treasuries.

USDCoins would not be backed by a blockchain, like USD is not backed by central bank computers and paper notes today. Fiat is and will be always backed by collateral (mostly government debt in the central bank). Also, blockchain technology is not a requirement for a cashless society, it has been already possible with database technology for a long time. A blockchain is just a more efficient way to secure a database, but same security can be accomplished with pre-blockchain database technology too. For a permissioned system like USDCoin would be, I see no significant advantages of using a blockchain.
Even if USDCoin was circulated, it would be issued by commercial banks to the public, since they have the privilege to obtain cash from the central bank only, but not the privates. Privates cannot get an account with the central bank, it is impossible by law. Some tried already and even went to court in order to get an account with the central bank, but were denied.

Printing money does not grow the economy, only productive credit does. Only the obligation to service a loan will make you as productive as possible. 
Inflation is just a necessity of our banking system, without it it would collapse. Since it runs on fractional reserve meaning the claims on money against banks are a multiple of actual money, it can only work if the majority of claims is never tested but kept as deposits in the bank forever. If there is no inflation, banks couldn't pay interest on deposit, thus keeping the money in a bank is less rewarding but still has the risks of losing it through a bank run.

Not 100% correct. Commercial banks do not create money, they create IOUs on money aka claims on cash, which does not need to exist in the first place. They only have to maintain a small reserve (assets which are redeemable for cash with the central bank) for all loans at the end of a reporting period, but not on a case by case basis.

There are nodes which download the same block over and over again in order to create artificial traffic and that slows down my node. 
Also I don't think what I am observing is the normal behavior of a node, especially when ports are scrambled like crazy. If a node can't connect it has to stop it after a retry limit instead of persistently trying to connect multiple times per second over weeks. If this is the normal behavior of a node, then I would consider it as a severe bug.

Bitcoin has the biggest network effect and highest security. Many altcoin will die because it is relatively more expensive to maintain a coin with a low market cap. Other coins will skyrock in value. Some newer coins might be scams. Since you don't know which coin will be a winner you need to diversify well between altcoins. In result the performance of an altcoin portfolio will not be much better but you have a lot of effort. I think it is not worth it.

Why would anyone pay 50-100% premium for a GBTC share, when you can get it at spot over an BTC ETF? Makes no sense. This has nothing to do with institutional investors. The only reason for the premium is that GBTC is the only way to buy BTC in a brokerage account at the moment.  You can also see on the historic price chart of GBTC that the premium got compressed right before the SEC decision on COIN, but then rose again after COIN was denied.

Fiat inflates by design, otherwise commercial banking wouldn't exist. In a gold standard people used paper notes instead of physical gold for convenience, since they trusted the banks and didn't know about fractional reserve, but it was very risky and leverage was low (gold standard was abolished for that reason).  This trust is gone forever, because people are aware of fractional reserve. Then how can a Bitcoin fractional reserve standard work, when everyone is aware about that MZM is way bigger than existing coins and coins could be withdrawn electronically 24/7/365 anytime? So forget about it.

You mix up cause and effect. Economic progress is one possible result of debt creation. Without debt there is no economic progress. But debt creation does not cause economic progress necessarily. If banks and central banks create credit as new debt it can go into real production of goods (productive) as well as inflation of asset prices (unproductive).

Why would they do that? Two scenarios come into mind:
1) To harm the Western world. That would be very inefficient, since Bitcoin is still economically negligible and it would be even in the interest of Western banks. Much more efficient would be e.g. nationalizing Foxconn, controlling supply and exports. The Western world would run out of electronic gadgets for business, social media, apps aso.  which would be a desaster for revenues, profits, US stock market aso.  
2) To protect their own banking system. Not impossible, but the Chinese government has much better tools like their Orwellian surveillance and harsh law and prosecution. On the other hand Bitcoin supports their economy. Essentially China is exporting electricity (they have huge overcapacities) for Dollars by mining Bitcoins. It would be stupid to kill it.

It's simply the parameters the process engineers expect for a certain node based on semiconductor physics. It won't be optimum from begin of production. There are tons of fabrication parameters which influence this. 
Another issue is yield. Even if the power consumption is within the expected range for a fully functioning chip, the power consumption might not be much lower for a partly functioning chip (which still is usable, when you can identify and disable the non- functioning cores). Yield is also not optimum from beginning.

Actually the reserve currency was gold until the early 20th century. A US-Dollar war more or less a unit for a certain mass of gold (and silver). With the use of telecommunication in the late 19th century (telegraph, telephone, later telex, fax, internet) gold became more and more impractical and paper derivatives, contracts, nettting and IOUs were more convenient, because those claims and liabilities could be transferred via telecommunication.
Bitcoin closes this gap now and in a distance future debt-backed fiat currencies will be considered just as a short transitional phase.

It simply means that you have to pay money when investing into government bonds instead of collecting interest. It just shows anxiety of investors, selling their investments and putting their "money into" government bonds. When demand for government bonds exceeds supply, interest rates are going down. They can get even negative as it can be seen here. Investors are willing to take a small loss, because they believe they could lose more money elsewhere. Central banks will act and provide more stimulus (essentially money printing), in order make investors confident again. E.g. by devaluing fiat, central banks hope that asset prices will increase and investors are flocking back into stocks or real estate.

From the article (via Google translate):
"...On the other hand, the usual "safe havens" were used, which investors use to bring their assets to safety in times of crisis. Once again, solid government securities rose more and more, leaving ten-year Bunds with a negative 0.52 percent return in the afternoon. Investors were willing to put up with an annual loss of more than 0.5 percent to keep their money safe. Ten-year US Treasuries yielded 1.76 percent, the lowest level since autumn 2016.
The crisis currency gold experienced an outbreak. The price for the troy ounce (31.1 grams) jumped on Monday temporarily to 1464 dollars. The precious metal has not been so expensive for six years, when the financial markets were still under the impact of the euro debt crisis and the future of the European currency seemed uncertain. Since the beginning of the year alone, the yellow metal has gained 17 percent. It is the strongest gold rally since 2016.
Even bigger was the jump at Bitcoin. For some investors, the cryptocurrency is now considered a digital version of the precious metal. Temporarily, nearly $ 12,000 had to be paid for a unit on Monday. That corresponded to a daily gain of around ten percent. The previous year's high stands at 12,744 dollars, in January, the Bitcoin listed in part at less than $ 4,000. Market observers are talking about gold and cryptocurrency escalation, which is accelerated as monetary policymakers push interest rates deeper and deeper into negative territory...."

The law clearly defines what has to be reported:
    It is legal to transport any amount of currency or other monetary instruments
    into or out of the United States. However, if you transport, attempt to transport,
    or cause to be transported (including by mail or other means) currency or other
    monetary instruments in an aggregate amount exceeding $10,000 or its foreign
    equivalent) at one time from the United States to any foreign country, or into the
    United States from any foreign country, you must file a report with U.S. Customs
    and Border Protection. This report is called the Report of International Transpor-
    tation of Currency or Monetary Instruments, FinCEN Form 105. Furthermore,
    if you receive in the United States, currency or other monetary instruments in
    an aggregate amount exceeding $10,000 (or its foreign equivalent) at one time,
    which has been transported, mailed, or shipped to you from any foreign place,
    you must also file a FinCEN Form 105. This form can be obtained at all U.S. ports
    of entry and departure or on the Web at 
    Monetary instruments include:
    1) U.S. or foreign coins and currency;
    2) Traveler checks in any form;
    3) Negotiable instruments (including checks, promissory notes,
    and money orders) that are either in bearer form, endorsed
    without restriction, made out to a fictitious payee, or other-
    wise in a form that the funds can be transferred to another
    person;
    4) Incomplete instruments (including checks, promissory
    notes, and money orders) signed, but with the payee’s name
    omitted; and
    5) Securities or stock in bearer form or otherwise in a form that
    the funds can be transferred to another person.
    However, the term “monetary instruments” does not include:
    1) Checks or money orders made payable to the order of a
    named person which have not been endorsed or which bear
    restrictive endorsements;
    2) Warehouse receipts; or
    3) Bills of lading.

M0 = currency reserves (of the banks with the central bank) + currency in circulation. 
M1 = currency in circulation + checking account deposits (=liabilities of banks)
[it's a bit simplified, but elaborating all the details does not make a significant difference here]
M1 &gt; M0, since we have a **fractional reserve system**
The consequence is that not all  checking account deposits can be paid out with cash if all money is withdrawn from the banks.
In contrast Bitcoin is a **full reserve system**, exchanges and custodian demands are 100% covered  with bitcoin = full reserve system. As a consequence all bitcoin deposits could be paid out. 
In a fiat **full reserve system** all deposits (which is not only M1) would be backed by M0.

Holding government bonds is holding fiat, but there are reasons why money is preferably "parked" in treasuries instead in bank accounts or cash: counter party risks with banks due to fractional reserve (bank runs), there is not so much cash in existence to "park" money (monetary base &lt;&lt; government debt). It is also very impractical to hoard several billions in cash (cost).

Not exactly true. Banks create credit out of collateral (e.g. a title on a house or car), then this credit (a liability for the bank) is payed out in cash (fiat) and it becomes a deposit of someone else (cash comes back in). So first is the credit, the deposit is just a result of credit creation, not the other way round. Banks have to maintain reserves for their liabilities, but not to the full extend, but a fraction only. That's why it's called fractional reserve. But this is a purely regulatory parameter, in some currency like Sweden or Australia the reserve requirement is even zero. 
With Bitcoin, fractional reserve lending is in theory possible too. It was done in the gold standard as well. It all depends on trust of the users in such a banking model. But it will be extremely risky for banks to go down to a small reserve amount like today, because Bitcoin is very fluid, can be transferred 24/7 within an hour and the cost and store are negligible. Because of that banks will face permanent bank runs and the reserve ratio will be very high close to 100%. Banks will also minimize the term structure risk, meaning they will make a loan only for the same term or shorter they have a deposit secured.

I wonder how this system can ever reach the equilibrium. As soon a the profitability crosses zero upwards, BCH hash rate goes up by 6,000% and stays there. It reverses when the profitability goes down again due to DA. Hashrate switches within minutes, but DA and EDA takes days. In addition, the 'control variable' (hashrate) can not be defined, it goes about 60fold up and down. Such a feedback control loop can never really control something, therefore the system just oscillates, probably forever. Even if the system was in equilibrium, any DA or price movement of a few percent would start the oscillation again. The only thing what brings the oscillation to a quick halt is a total collapse of either the BTC or the BCH price. Or the BCH difficulty might just oscillate slowly upwards until so much hashpower is drawn from the BTC chain, that it gets stuck (since it has no EDA) long enough to cause a price crash. But this scenario requires a continuous rise in price of BCH relative to BTC.

Right, this approach is anything else than libertarian. It would put the central bank bureaucrats in charge of credit creation. Of course, it would cut the power and profits of private banks, but it would make their monetary system worse.

At the same time, it could be a "national security" related coup to prevent a non-US investor to take over GitHub.

That is technically correct. The Bureau of Engraving and Printing, which is a branch of the US-Treasury, prints the Federal Reserve Notes. But the Treasury can't bring them into circulation, so they have to "surrender" them to the Federal Reserve.


Right, they do it in the secondary market via POMO, or reverse repo (which is a purchase, but with maturity = agreement of repurchase by the seller). 


No, you obviously don't understand what M2 is. 
*M2 is a calculation of the money supply that includes all elements of M1 as well as "near money." M1 includes cash and checking deposits, while near money refers to savings deposits, money market securities, mutual funds, and other time deposits...*
Source: 
M2 is increased when banks create credit out of collateral and that credit becomes deposits through economic activity (e.g. purchase of a house). This process doesn't print a single Dollar, it just increases the amount of claims on Dollars, if you know what the difference between both is.
It is somewhat different than increasing the cash money supply through purchasing assets with freshly printed money. In part this printed money gets into circulation (e.g. when privates sell US-Treasuries to the Federal Reserve) and it impacts M2, since cash in circulation is a component of M2. But to compare the balance sheet of the Federal Reserve with M2 of China is really stupid, since it compares apples and oranges. If you want to compare money printing by central banks you have to compare their balance sheets.

You make your argument without math. Money doesn't disappear, when you invest. It just changes hands. There are about $15 trillion in cash in circulation, deposits, money market funds and other liquid assets denoted in Dollars plus $40 trillion in bonds. These deposits and assets lose significant value or become essentially worthless in a high or hyper inflation.

Banks don't create money, only the central bank does. Banks create credit = liabilities for money, which become deposits, but not the actual money. This video is bad, it suggests there would be cash existing for all deposits, which is wrong. It wouldn't be fractional reserve in this case. In fact, a majority of deposits is just a number in a book, for which cash exists only for a small portion of deposits. Also, the scheme they are describing is just a complicated way to explain the reserve ratio, but it doesn't happen this way in reality. 
Here a bit more scientific explanation, although I don't like the claim that "banks create money out of thin air":

Simply because there is a strong deflationary pressure caused by the already high debt levels. When less new credit is created than old credit has to be paid back, the money supply is shrinking.

The difference between lightning and commercial banking is big. Commercial banking uses fractional reserve and has counter party risk, because the bank becomes the owner of your funds, while you are left with a contractual claim against the bank only. Lightning is full reserve and has no counterpart risk, because you still own the unspent funds in the payment channel and there is no third party in possession of your funds. 
I agree that a majority of economically active funds will circulate in payment channels and rarely will be settled on the Bitcoin blockchain as the technology matures and users get confident with the technology. Since their is no counter party risk on Lightning, there won't be such issues like bank runs.

Since it can lead to chain split the new rule clearly invalidates an existing rule from the perspective of mining nodes, while it doesn't for the non-mining nodes (so you are right on that in particular, but not in general). There are always two perspectives on the same rule change. It isn't a rule violation from one perspective but from the other and then it is still considered a soft fork. I was not aware of that  and I think this is a weird definition thereof. SegWit was actually not as harmless as I originally thought.

Changing numbers in banks' books (balances) is not clearing for cash. It is just information on money, not money (cash or reserves with the central bank). Please try to understand the difference between both. As long as just numbers are changed, it is just an agreement/contract, where the money still has to follow. Banks move money by exchanging reserves with the central bank. This is done once a day M-F known as net clearing. It is not done in real time as gross clearing. To expedite this process, banks can use cash pools or short term loans, but this comes with with additional cost as well as risks and is not for free. The actual cost is just hidden from the user and the bank collects it through its other services and interest rates. As a fun fact the actual cost of our payment systems is about 2% of GDP.

Asset prices, real estate, rents, health care premiums aso., many thing went up subtantially. And pls tell me again we have near zero inflation. The CPI is just a phony statistics.
Overall money supply barely keeps up with nominal growth. That's why we haven't seen significant inflation in terms of CPI yet. [QE money is just a component of overall money supply]
Also QE keeps the inflation in check psychologically, because the Fed could sell those assets (destroying QE money, removing liquidity) in case of strong inflation. The market is pricing that in. If the Fed could write down government debt in their books, then inflation expectations would be quite different.

Fiat money has been around at least since the Romans and Chinese empires. Roman government secretly reduced the silver content of their issued coins, in order to fund government expenditures about 2,000 years ago. Government issued paper money, which wasn't backed by gold and silver, was invented about 1,000 years ago in China. In both cases their financial systems collapsed in the end. Fiat (latin) means a legally binding command or decision entered on the court record. In contrast to common believe, fiat money is money by law, order or decree which can have backing or no backing at all.

What is asked for is an independent audit of the Federal Reserve of non-disclosed operations:
"Dr. Rand Paul to Introduce ‘Audit the Fed’ as Amendment to Senate Banking Bill
Audit the Fed would require the nonpartisan, independent Government Accountability Office (GAO) to conduct a thorough audit of the Federal Reserve’s Board of Governors and reserve banks within one year of the bill’s passage and to report back to Congress within 90 days of completing the audit.
* The legislation would amend section 714b of Title 31 of the U.S. Code to allow the GAO to fully audit:
* transactions for or with a foreign central bank, government of a foreign country, or nonprivate international financing organization;
* deliberations, decisions, or actions on monetary policy matters, including discount window operations, reserves of member banks, securities credit, interest on deposits, and open market operations;
* transactions made under the direction of the Federal Open Market Committee; or
* a part of a discussion or communication among or between members of the Board and officers and employees of the Federal Reserve System related to clauses (1)–(3) of this subsection."
Existing "audits" do not reveal that, otherwise Senator Dr. Rand Paul would not demand it or the Federal Reserve would not "strongly oppose" it. Obviously there is a big backdoor hiding operations from the public.

I doubt that the HF is fixing that. Many miners jump between chains even if there is a tiny profitability advantage. Difficulty can jump 2x instead of 4x, but now for every 144 blocks. The only positive is, that they abolished that crappy EDA. Now they have to mine a full difficulty adjustment cycle (144 blocks) before difficulty goes down and they can't take the EDA shortcut.

That is what some people envisioned, but it is up to economics when this happens, which depends on price and usage. There is an economical limit on fees spent for electricity.

"High" fees are paid for a while, in longer corrections too, so this is not an argument. Bitcoin fees are not an economical equation only. When you do a transaction and can clear the payment within about an hour where other payment systems cannot compete with respect to clearing time and security, users will chose to use it. It might not be useful on 'layer 1' to pay for a cup of coffee, like it might be not economical to to pay for a cup of coffee with the Federal Reserve's RTGS. And just to scale the block size isn't either innovative nor economical. If you tried to bring the fees down to a penny by simply scaling the block size, you will end up with an insecure system and get nothing in the end.

Your deposits with the bank are not backed by gold, only the bank's cash reserves and your cash is backed by gold in a gold standard. Everything else is just claims on money/gold, while there are multiple claims on the same bar of gold. This is not a secret and people are much more educated than 100 years ago. They also know from experience that a central bank can abolish the gold standard at any time. Why would people trust them? 
In addition the credit creating commercial banks can go belly up much quicker, because the central bank can't print gold to provide liquidity in order to rescue them.

@_date: 2017-11-11 18:42:31
The block hash is just a proof that a transaction was confirmed by a miner, nothing else.  A miner could simply cheat by including invalid signatures, therefore nodes have to verify that anyway and will refuse blocks with invalid signatures, which is not different between non-SegWit and SegWit transactions. Including the signature in the Merkle tree does not provide additional security. Essentially it is an optimization, since it removes redundant information for the block hashing. Maybe it breaks the wording but nothing in Bitcoin fundamentally. Rizun, Ver &amp; CGW just grasp the last straws here.
SegWit enables future adoptions, because it fixes malleability. BCH doesn't it, that's why BCH will never scale.

It's a consensus among all users and such a change required that all users agree, otherwise the chain will split into two, one with the existing supply rule, the other with the different, inflating supply rule. The market will value two coins and for sure the coin with the 21 million limit rule will be more valuable. Then miners have more economic incentive to mine the more valuable coin. The other coin would be less attractive economically and would be lacking the network effect anyway.

Forks are part of the concept, you can't prevent them. The users in a free market will decide over the price, which coin is more valuable than the other. Miners will just follow the price and mine what is most profitable for them. When you compare Bitcoin to altcoins, it is obvious that they have the widest adoption, which is reflected in price.

Oh, an excuse why the theory doesn't work. The Federal Reserve liquidity programs don't make the velocity measurements invalid.


Just look at M3 Eurozone and Federal Reserve (the latter doesn't publish it, but there are secondary sources).  Both were declining after the financial crisis.


Not constantly, as can be seen from the statistics. But in the long term [credit created] needs to be bigger than [credit destroyed], otherwise the whole money "chain mail" system will collapse. 
@_date: 2015-08-15 18:27:14
So the Federal Reserve wants to create hefty deflation? 
And there is no correlation of velocity to economic activity here. As I said - meaningless. That some economic theories claim otherwise is no proof. When deposits are spent it is rather deflationary, because debtors can pay back debt and take out less new credit. [credit destroyed] &gt; [credit created] = deflationary.

Price levels correlate quite well with money supply - just look at the last housing bubble caused by extensive credit creation = money supply inflation. Without money supply there will be no prices, without increase in money supply there will be no increase in price levels in the long term and average, although in the short term price levels will fluctuate in both directions in different sectors by specific supply and demand situations. Bottom line is that money supply increase is the root cause, which generates both supply (any manufacturing beyond self-sustainability needs prior funding through credit) and demand (any demand beyond self-sustainability can be satisfied by new credit only).

No, there is no digital Dollar for payment in existence, by law or in practice. Only notes, coins and reserves of the banks with the central banks are Dollars. The latter can be electronic deposits with the central bank, but only commercial banks have access to them, not the public. What people mean by 'digital Dollars' are claims against banks and other institutions denoted in Dollars. E.g. electronic banking transfers, credit card transfers or electronic check transmissions are all just claim transfers from one counter party to another counter party denoted in Dollars, but no Dollars. Actual Dollars still have to be moved to make this transfer complete. When you have a deposit with your bank, you receive just a contractual claim against the bank. To have this claim in digital form, does not make your claim a digital Dollar. Of course, you can use these claims as medium of payments and these claims mimic 'digital Dollars', but with such a payment no Dollars are transferred, just claims against third parties denoted in Dollars. When a third party e.g. your bank ceases to exist, your claims become mainly worthless.

This is a misconception:




PayPal/Visa do not transmit value over the internet and not p2p at all. They transmit messages to banks only, while then the banks clear the money over their systems (central banks, SWIFT, Target2 etc). PayPal/Visa would not exist without banks. Also it is not their invention. Western Union essentially did that in the 19th century via the telegraph already. New technology like the Internet just allowed this messaging system to scale, to get faster, more secure, cheaper aso.   
The novelty of Bitcoin is that you can transfer value like you can do it with gold p2p, but over the internet and that completely trustless and permissionless without banks, central banks, middlemen, third party depositories aso. It creates an own currency. That people use it as a store of value, is just a logical consequence because they trust this system.

Did Krugman ever asked himself: How long does it take to *clear* a payment from Hong Kong to New York (I mean really clear, the banker in New York lets him leave the building with $50.000 and it does not involve any risks for both)? How much does it cost to make such a wire transfer?
I agree, they are already there, but it is order of magnitudes less efficient.  
Also does Krugman ever asked himself: What is the counter party and systemic risk that such a wire transfer goes bad? 
Maybe he should open an account in Greece to learn what centralization means. 
He hates libertarians, because he is keynesian (you know these the central planning types).

Topic is not about removing cash, but negative interest rates. So far they can't be applied on cash and you are right the overall effect would be marginal. BUT, all deposits are liabilities for the banks which are backed only in fraction by reserves (fractional reserve). When negative interest rates on bank deposits are set, people would withdraw  much more deposits as cash. If the withdrawals exceed the reserves (in the US it's 11% of liabilities), then the banks go belly up. That's why setting negative rates at scale is a no go. Either they have to abolish cash or implement a scheme where you get charged on your cash as well so there is no advantage to withdraw your deposits as cash.

It is possible to do fractional reserve in Bitcoin, if people deposit a majority of Bitcoins with banks. But there is no need to do that, since it is not required for store of value or medium of exchange. Fractional reserve in Bitcoin could work technically, but not by economics.
If banks would issue a cryptocurrency, they would face the same problem = no deposits, unless they are devaluing it heavily and/or force you to keep it deposited. PoW mining would not work, since banks want to create loans out of "nothing" and won't invest money into creating new money. Mining would have to be restricted to banks, otherwise everyone could create it out of nothing. Then the money creation needs to be somehow regulated in order to prevent creating it too fast (inflation). This requires some central authority. In the the end a bank crypto would just be a centralized, trusted and permissioned system. Essentially it would be private money like US private banks issued before the Federal Reserve Note, but without backed by anything like it was in the past (gold). I guess no one would use such a currency unless forced to. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 02:25:20
Because it is technically totally different, it is a completely different system. It looks similar from the payment function, but the underlaying system is different. Banks and governments can freeze, block, or seize your funds, they can limit your payments in times of financial or political instability. Remember, that you don't own or control the money in a bank account, you just have a claim on money against a bank. There are way more claims on money than money exists. If this is challenged, it gets ugly for the bank customers, they can simply cut them off from their money (like they did in Cyprus or Greece). Bitcoin is like cash, which you own and control and which can be sent to other users directly. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:20:26

The only reason we use fiat today, is because we are forced to (just read some Keynes). In the end everyone has to pay taxes in fiat or go to jail. In the global context states try to enforce global trade in their currency through hegemonic politics. Get some education on what fiat money is. Fiat is established as money by government regulation or law and this comes with the cost of funding a state in order to enforce a money monopoly on a national or global scale. Without it fiat can't exist.

Your thinking is flawed. M1 consists of M0 and checking and some other deposits. If you make an electronic payment, base money (cash or reserves of the bank redeemable for cash) still changes hands behind the curtain. An electronic deposit from your bank to your lender reduces the reserves of your bank with the central bank and increases the reserves of your lender. Effectively any payment, even an electronic  payment is a cash payment (that's why it takes days to get a payment cleared).

Commercial banks create credit out of collateral, which increases deposits of the public. They can create inflation by inflating asset prices which causes ripple effects on other prices. The housing bubble is a good example how credit creation inflated asset prices which caused rising cost of living, e.g. through rents. Bank lending is only limited by collateral and own reserves. If banks gain additional reserves (through bank profits) and the public is willing to provide collateral, credit creation is unlimited, especially when inflated asset prices increase the value of collateral.

GDP growth is always measured in real terms, not nominal Dollars. Check GDP deflator. If GDP grows by 3%, economic output increases by 3% in real terms, not in Dollar terms.

y = y(x-1) * 1.03 (xth year)
which is the same as (y(x-1) ... y2, y1 substituted):
y = a * 1.03 * ... * 1.03 * 1.03
y = a * 1.03^x
Which is an exponential function.
So if the politicians, governments, economists, central banks aso. try to increase the economic output by 3% each year (what they do), they clearly want an exponential rise of economic output. The same is true for any other percentage rate, the rise remains exponential. The US has been growing for more than 200 years at a substantial rate, so there is evidence of exponential growth long term. 
Unfortunately the effects of the exponential function is underestimated by mankind. There is nice lecture on that:
*"The Greatest Shortcoming of the Human Race is our Inability to Understand the Exponential Function"*

Bitcoins are not in a wallet, but the private keys which give you the rights to move your coins on the blockchain to a different address. 
When you set up your wallet you make a backup with a pencil on a piece of paper (12 words ore more). When your wallet gets lost, destroyed, whatever, you  just buy a new one and enter those words and - magic - the new wallet holds your old private keys again.

Because they have to pay taxes in fiat or go to jail.


These currencies were never world reserve currencies.
Regarding Austria, the Shilling was abolished in 1938 and replaced by the Reichsmark, because Nazi-Germany annexed (Anschluss) the country. If Austria could have preserved its sovereignty, their fiat would have continued to exist. So a certain fiat can only exist, when a country is sovereign which requires defense, a stable political system aso. 


I agree, in part of "maintaining an economy that will guarantee the value of the currency" is changing the political system in countries in order to allow trade, investments in and export of Dollars. 


This is not true, because it is contradicting. Fiat means money by law, order, decree. Legal tender is just defined by that, so legal tender can only exist when there is money laws. A government can define gold as legal tender, then gold gets the status as a fiat currency. 


No, it is accepted, because it is enforced so, indirectly via tax laws. 


The value is derived from its backing. Todays fiat money is backed by debt and the value is derived from its quality. If a government goes bankrupt, because it can't service its debt anymore, the value of the currency will diminish, either slowly or in a crash. During the hyperinflations in Germany, Zimbabwe and now Venezuela fiat was (is still) widely accepted, but the value of it dropped significantly.   


It is a union of states, just without a central government but with military forces including a nuclear power (France). The Euro is essentially a Dollar derivate, because of the strong economic and military alliance (NATO) with the US. The US maintains military bases all over Europe, they do common military drills in Europe and European countries take part in US military operations worldwide.

You probably mean gold currency, which is something different than a gold standard. 
The enabler for fractional reserve is utility (security, transmission, divisibility), since people leave most their funds with trusted parties most of the time. But this is not given for Bitcoin. 
In general you can't prevent credit creation, no matter if regulated or unregulated, as soon as a scheme requires trust. Exchanges are trusted entities and it is possible that exchanges do fractional reserve, but this can happen to very limited degree only, since it doesn't provide utility to leave most of ones funds with them other than for fiat-Bitcoin conversion.

No bank as enough reserves to cover it's liabilities. That's why it is called fractional reserve. A bank run extinguishes the banks reserves below it's minimum requirement (they always maintain a higher level for deposit fluctuations). If the minimum requirement is not met, the bank is bankrupt and taken out of business by the regulators.
And as I said, banks increase their reserves constantly as the monetary system does. So there is a no limit on reserves, thus there is no limit on credit creation in the end. 
What you probably looking for is a commodity standard of a limited resource where you can't just increase the reserves in the monetary system, but this was abolished a long time ago.

You are correct on the part of credit creation by commercial banks, except that the loan is not backed by the banks reserves (it never can, because it is a fractional reserve only), but by its collateral. These bank deposits are spendable, they have the function of money, but they are not money. They are a claim against the bank or a liability of the bank. When you spend them, you just request your bank to transfer some of the bank's liabilities to another entity.

With a government issued "Bitcoin" you can circumvent banks and the counterparty risk with them. It would put the monetary system upside down, it became a full reserve system essentially wiping out commercial banks (by taking away their biggest economic function) and the central bank became the only credit creator. Weidmann understands this. In case a government issued "Bitcoin" is not designed as such, it will be the very same system we have now. In other words: our existing monetary system can never accept a modernization or it would destroy itself. And, as we know from history, systems which can't accept modernization are doomed to fail. They can only delay the inevitable, extend and pretend as long as possible.

Only a small fraction of it, since a bank uses the money coming in to pay their own obligations (customer requesting cash, borrowings from the central bank and other banks). When you deposit $1,000 with a bank, the next guy in line requesting $1,000 from his deposit might get the very same bills you just gave to the teller before. Banks are required to keep only a small reserve. Essentially this system is a shell game, where cash is used as a medium to transfer deposits. If all customers requesting a payout of their deposits, even every sound bank will go bankrupt in no time, since the reserves are way smaller than the sum of all deposits - the classic bank run.


Commercial banks do not loan out deposits, they create credit from collateral. If you get a car loan, the bank simply increases the balance on an account and they get the title in return. The money is then transferred to the car dealer. If the car dealer has an account with the same bank, the bank does not need even cash. If the dealer has an account with another bank or wants cash, the bank needs reserves with the central bank (redeemable for cash) or cash in the vault. Cash in the amount of the loan will leave the bank, but all other banks are doing the same: creating loans and paying them out, so cash from other banks or cash deposits come in too. In average the net cash outflows are only a small fraction of the loans - cash that remains in circulation. Of course there are rules and regulations, how much a bank is allowed to create, they need a certain amount of deposits and reserves for it, but essentially the banks inflate the money supply by creating loans. You can see that when tracking the monetary aggregates (e.g. M2-M0, deposits which come back from loans are growing). When a loan is paid back, the bank reduces the amount from its balance sheet, they "destroy" the credit, which they created some time before. If demand for loans is growing, the money supply inflates, if the demand for loans is shrinking the money supply deflates (what the central banks are fearing and fighting).

Because a majority of users want to keep it decentralized. To allow VISA level, it would be cost prohibitive for most node operators. Only bigger organizations or wealthy individuals would be able to afford that.
BTW: "Bitcoin" is not limited, there were forks done bumping up the blocksize. So users had a **free choice**, but most decided to stick with existing Bitcoin. Simply, it can't be claimed, something or someone would prevent higher transaction throughput. Since it is open source and there are no secrets and no private ownership rights of the code, anyone is free to create and promote a different version, but they can't force other users to abandon the existing version.

Impossible, central governments will never give up their monetary sovereignty. This is a basic idea behind modern fiat. By certifying BTC, gold, silver, etc the government would essentially give up the possibility to fund itself through the printing press. Government fiats will slowly cease to exist. Their might be private institutions which certify BTC deposits and essentially issuing their own notes, perhaps electronically these days. This is what private US banks in the 19th century did, they issued gold certificates as bank notes which could be used as money.

You are dead wrong. I EXPERIENCED and I am EXPERIENCING health care in both countries MYSELF. I am getting charged ridiculous medical bills and insurance premiums, denied treatment in the US myself and know what I am talking about. 
Germany has also a private health insurance sector in **competition** to the public health care system and I know how it works there, because I had the choice to switch to the private insurance when I was living in Germany. There is no much difference in premiums and services between the two systems in Germany, the private insurance is slightly more expensive and has slightly better service. 
And what has illegal immigration to do with the health care system? It looks like your are blaming health care cost on illegal immigration. Your arguments are simply stupid because illegal immigration in Germany is essentially non-existent, because almost every immigrant gets the status of a political refugee or comes from very poor EU countries like Romania and as residents they all get access to the health care system too. 
Just some facts: The GDP per capita is 54k in the US compared to 46k in Germany. Only In the **first 6 months of 2015 there were 180,000 refugees** coming to Germany. Between 1995 and 2014 3.2 million refugees came to Germany (not counting the immigration from EU countries). And those immigrants are coming from very poor regions, mostly war zones like Syria at the moment. According to your theory the German health care system must be in a worse state than the US', but it isn't the case.

Gold has better fungibility, but is very impractical. Bigger amounts bear no fungibility, since every gold dealer needs to report transactions to the authorities. The 51% vulnerability is exaggerated, since an attacker can only sabotage the system, but not steal coins. That comes with a very high cost and there are countermeasures possible (since an attack will be quite centralized). Quantum computing vulnerability is exaggertated too, since such computers won't be available the next 10 years at scale and there are quantum proof signature schemes possible. Also the economical factors come into play, the cost of a quantum computer must justify the return.

Investment is just another form of saving, it is a secondary aspect of the economy. Technology is mainly the result of funding. The main driver of economic growth is debt creation, today credit creation by commercial banks. Credit creates savings as a result and consequently investments, thus these things are secondary. Demand is created by business debtors, they have to market and advertise their product and are forced to sell, otherwise they go bankrupt. Demand beyond basic needs is essentially a result of credit creation.

I never paid so much. 
The chart is misleading in four ways: 
1) Aggregated transactions - mostly done by businesses - are much more expensive than a single input- single output transaction, because they are bigger in size (can be 50kBytes ore more compared to 225 Bytes), but you pay the fee per bytes, not per transaction.  
2) Some users are paying excessive fees like &gt;2000 sat/B, when it would go through for 100 sat/B. This is skewing the average value.
3) Many users are generally overpaying fees, when you can get it for a much lower fee. Some businesses like BitPay even encourage excessive overpaying, I get always a warning message "low fee payment" and it would take up to 48 hours, when it gets confirmed for $0.15 fee within the next hour. 
4) Some users are bloating the mempool by sending excessive fee transactions with unconfirmed outputs. These transactions stay in the mempool for days without a chance to get confirmed but are considered by badly implemented fee estimators as confirmable transactions. 
All these things lead to the misleading impression, the required fees are "too high", when they aren't.  
In addition if fees were "too high", people would stop using Bitcoin. But it isn't the case obviously.

No, it works the other way. Power consumption is mainly a linear function of the clock frequency and ASICs will be always used at max clock speed possible in order to gain the max hashing power. When turning on or off this feature, clock speed doesn't change, so power consumption of the hashing circuitry stays the same, but ASICBoots will provide more results in the same time.

I agree, it is no guarantee of preservation of the value of fiat. But that was not my point. With the obligation to pay taxes governments keep the money monopoly no matter how much worth the money base unit is.

Even during the Weimar hyperinflation the majority of commerce was done with fiat, although the money lost value by the minute.

I didn't say it is wrong what you wrote other than fractional reserve makes it limited. Banks increase their reserves through their net income, so credit creation is never limited. In addition banks buy central bank collateral (e.g. treasury notes from the government) and can deposit it with the Federal Reserve or sell it outright to them and get cash in return, which increases the base money supply in circulation. This allows increasing the credit creation on the system level. Central banks can also reduce the reserve ratio. It all depends on the quality of the central bank collateral. Reduced quality of the collateral reduces the value of a currency. Runaway inflation is absolutely possible in a fractional reserve system even without issuing net money (helicopter money).

Money is notes and coins as well as reserves redeemable for notes with the central bank. A bank deposit is just a claim against the bank on money.

This simply ignores the fact that capitalism worked very well in a gold standard the 200 years before. The reason for the 1929 crash was not a gold standard, but too much lending by commercial banks. Inflated money supply (inflated debt load) combined with collapsing asset (which were bought on loans) prices led inevitably to a liquidity crisis, since the money for paying those loans back was limited. Such a scenario becomes quickly self-reinforcing. Deflation is an amplified problem in fractional reserve banking, especially when credit excesses by banks are not prevented by government regulation.

What  you probably mean is deposits of banks with the Federal Reserve (M0-MB), but these are full reserve and can be redeemed for legal tender at any time by banks, but it is no legal tender, when not redeemed yet. The Federal Reserve issues money as legal tender to the public, but if it's inside the Federal Reserve it can't be legal tender, since it isn't issued. Central bank deposits have only a function as currency between banks, nor can the banks create such deposits on their own. It has no function for the general public as it has no access to them, so there is no such thing as an "electronic Dollar".

Money in the bank is just a claim against the bank, or an IOU (I own you). The bank has no obligation to save it in a vault (except for a small reserve), they can use it to pay their own liabilities as long as you don't claim it back. If you claim it back, the bank has to borrow it from somewhere else.
In addition, a power can limit the usability of fiat money (capital controls), confiscate it (bail-in) or inflate it (hyperinflation) artificially. Or a fiat currency can decease, because the government does not support it anymore. All has happened in history a lot. The average lifetime of all fiat currencies has been 27 years. 
In contrast, Bitcoin is a currency you can really own and control. You don't have counter party risks (if you store the keys youself), only systemic risks (the government could shut down the internet or some event destroys all computer technology).

There was sound reasoning to set the limit "so low". A higher limit would have degraded the network and would have made it more centralized. 
Just increasing the blocksize would lower the cost significantly and therefore self-reinforce demand (demand at zero cost is infinite). We would run into the same problem again quickly and had to repeat it over and over again until the system fails. So this can never be the solution, it can be a temporary fix only.
Payment channels like Lightning solve the cost problem of micro transactions without the need to increase the limit. SegWit enables the Lightning Network, which is a completely new quality, not just quantity. In addition it increases capacity by 100% instantly, which is a good compromise for satisfying current on-chain demand. Over the time (as the technology is adopted by users) payment channels will replace on-chain transactions, since it makes sense for the users economically. The reduction in on-chain demand will relax the situation and make space for overall growth.

A growing economy does not mean necessarily it is healthy, especially because it is not sustainable due to resource consumption. A growing economy is just the result of credit creation by private banks, not an inherent wish of mankind.

In communism, you need state power in order to ban private enterprise. Why would that make a difference if the ruling power comes from a central government or a decentralized consensus? Essentially a decentralized consensus was the basic idea of communism (everyone works hard and takes only what he needs based on the consensus), but it can never work, because it ignores economics. A decentralized consensus communism will always fail, simply because the people have little to nothing to eat in the end (lack of productivity). And that is not just theory, but I experienced myself socialism in different countries (I grew up there).  When socialism already fails, then no society will ever enter communism. Communism even as decentralized consensus is a great illusion/utopia/unicorn, something that never can work.

Isn't the network's throughput somehow a function of the simultaneous connections of their nodes? The more simultaneous connections each node has, the faster the information can be propagated through the network until all nodes got a copy of that information. Therefore, if nodes reduced their simultaneous connections the overall network would get slower which results in known impacts. Increasing blocksize would slow down network propagation not only due to longer transmission time of a block, but also by nodes trying to limit their bandwidth usage through reduction of simultaneous connections. So bottom line is that network propagation time is not a proportional function of blocksize.

I agree, it is not true for a particular person, but for the population in general. They are saving forever and never spend their savings, just take a look at deposits (M3).

More because the Bitmain patent doesn't apply outside of China and miners might get sued by the owners of the original patent, because they did not license it to Bitmain.

There were similar cases in the past, e.g. where a US patent holder got such an order against a US cell phone operator.

I don't argue that paying back debt reduces the amount of credit, if no new credit in the same amount is created at the same time. BUT it makes absolutely no difference if debt is paid back with cash or an electronic payment. In both cases the bank receives cash or assets redeemable for cash (since an electronic payment is nothing else than transferring cash or assets redeemable for cash to that bank over the central bank system).

It's not only an honest opinion, it's a fact proven by simple logic. The 17 trln dollars in deposits of the public (Federal Reserve System) do not disappear by investing or spending, they just change hands. So the system can never get rid of the savings, only some individuals can while others gain it at the same time. When rates go negative (savings, CDs, bonds), what would be the rationale action of those savers here?
Also it is a complete misconception, that banks store money. It is common knowledge that banks keep only a small fraction of the deposits in their vaults for their daily operation (expected cash withdrawals). In general a deposit is a loan to the bank which it uses to pay its obligations to other banks (interbank loans), the central bank (cash borrowing) and the public (withdrawals).

Lending the same thing multiple times is simply creating the difference. Cash acts just a medium or token for transferring credit. The cash in existence is a small fraction of money deposits people have in banks and this can be the result of creation ONLY, nothing else. 
There is no unlend money in existence, since all money is the result of credit creation (loans). Money = debt. If there were no loans money would not exist at all (except for the gold reserves of a central bank).

Because with zero or negative inflation people would stash cash into matresses and the whole system would collapse. Maintaining an inflation target is difficult, since central bank policy measures work only well to limit inflation  but not to create inflation.  Inflation is the result  of credit creation of private banks. If the privates don't want to take out loans, it causes deflation because older loans have to be paid back (demand for money does not go down while supply does).

If you use a dice list with about 7000 words and a passphrase of at least 13* words, brainwallets are secure. Then you get the same entropy as a 160 bit random number.
What the article states is incorrect. Brainwallets are not insecure in general, they are insecure if you don't create them correctly. 
*Correction: Each word adds about 12.9 bits of entropy. So for 160 bit (bitcoin private key) you need 13 words.

This is the wrong way to compare numbers. A node is connected to at least 8, many to dozens of peers, propagating blocks and unconfirmed transactions. In addition the average bandwidth is not the limiting factor, but the peak bandwidth. Blocks need to propagate in a shorter time than just the average block intervals, otherwise it slows the network down to a point where it reduces security. 
Although, most nodes are connected fast enough to process 4MB or 8MB blocks, it doesn't solve the problem of scaling. It would be a short term fix only and not changing the block size and other fundamental features itself  is also a security feature. There is more benefit keeping the block size at 1MB (ex SegWit).

That's not true. Today's mixed signal SoCs in smart phones are way more complex and produced in tens of millions at very low cost. A mining ASIC is a quite simple design compared to that, because it contains just n replications of a relatively simple hashing core. 
An RTL model can be perfectly verified with open source tools. For technology mapping (synthesis, place and route including the verification steps) you need expensive commercial tools and experts, but this is not rocket science and fairly simple compared to a mixed signal SoC.
Of course, an operation would need some initial investment in the $20M range, but this is really peanuts when you look what money is thrown at some stupid IoT projects. When Silicon Valley investors throw $120M at a [useless hipster juicer]( why they wouldn't fund a $20M chip venture? I guess they need just more education on the subject.

Manipulation of interest rates is a result of running an unsustainable, pyramid-like monetary system. It has to be kept in a positive feedback loop, otherwise it collapses. Since debt grows faster than real production, this system has reached  a ratio where interest manipulation does not work anymore (since it has reached zero). Quantitative easing (buying assets with the printing press) does not solve this problem, it is just band aid to delay the inevitable. Next step will be financial repression (forced negative rates and/or helicopter money), to delay the collapse until it will inevitably collapse.
 


In a debt driven economy the solvency of the consumers is the underlaying problem. If a debtor has no income left for increased credit based consumption, credit cannot grow consequently, but it has to grow in order to maintain the pyramid like system. The only logical consequence is collapse, reset and re-start.

He had no prior experience in ASIC design when starting KnC. His only education listed on his LinkedIn resume - is "Priory community school", whatever that is. It is not something you can learn at home with Open Source software and from web forums. You need access to expensive (up to high six-digit Dollars) tools and exposure to many real projects. Also chip design requires a lot of fundamental knowledge and many years of experience or you must be born genius. Obviously he was not.
He is wrong by suggesting that reverse engineering requires the analysis of the physical layout in a very expensive lab. This is only required, if the internal functionality is a big secret or you want to clone a design with exactly the same timing, power consumption and die size. But this is not the case if you just want to prove that a certain functionality is contained in a chip. You don't need the code used for the design of the chip, since the functionality is well known, defined and analyzed. Greg just reverse engineered a behavioral model of the important part of the Bitmain ASIC in order to prove it is in there by comparing his model with the behavior of the ASIC. For his purpose he did not need to recreate the physical layout of the whole thing.

I see, that is a totally different topic. I was talking about designers verifying their hardware and they would rather verify that their backdoor works.  
In general your fear is overblown. The designer usually hands out the physical design database (GDSII) to an ASIC manufacturer and it is extremely expensive and time consuming to hack a design from there. GDSII contains geometric information for the semiconductor fabrication process. The only structural information which can be retrieved is a schematic on transistor level, or at best on gate level. Then you have to analyze the circuitry completely to be able to hide some additional stuff without breaking the design (not only functionally, but also from timing delays) and also in a way that the customer does not notice. Given the complexity of todays chips it is impossible to get this accomplished within the time frame the customer expects the chips back. 
Security critical functions must be implemented as open source software (which allows formal analysis), otherwise you can't trust the product. The hash function itself is not security sensitive, it either works or it returns wrong results, but that would be noticed immediately. Therefore it is not critical to have it implemented in closed source hardware.

Essentially UK has the same monetary system as US, Euro, Japan and others. Money between customers is transferred by exchanging collateral over their reserves with the central bank. US is a little bit different, because there is 12 central banks (Federal Reserve is a system of central banks, not a central bank). In Euro it is even more complicated, because they have the ECB and national central banks. An international bank-to-bank transfer is basically accomplished by exchanging collateral between the bank and the national central bank, the national central bank and the ECB, the ECB and the other national central bank and the  other national central bank and the other bank. INSTANT bank transfer systems (which exist in the Euro zone too) do nothing else as to hide the complexity from the user and use a margin system in order to pay out the cash, but these margins have to be maintained which involves costs and profits for the middlemen.  In addition these margin systems (e.g. Target II in the Euro zone) create financial risks for the tax payers. It is not as cheap as it looks like. In contrast, with Bitcoin you transfer p2p, pay the fee and you are done.

Yeah right, Bitcoin will never replace fiat by force of law. It is a consensus currency, people will accept and use on their own through economic advantage. None expects Bitcoin to become legal tender. That would make it a fiat currency. Fiat will exist as long as a government orders this, but a government can't order its economic viability or valuation. You can see that in Venezuela. And Bitcoin is way more than a technological innovation, it is a socio-economic phenomena which enables its currency function among other use cases. Bitcoin as currency alone is more efficient than using fiat, and the prosperity of a society depends on economic efficiency. Any government which undermines economic efficiency and forces us to use lower efficiency will lose its national sovereignty in the end.

I never claimed these machines do not have owners, but it is reality that machines do economic decisions autonomously and owners do only program goals and check them from time to time. With artificial intelligence getting more advanced and the technology becoming cheaper, machines are becoming able to do more complex and sophisticated economic decisions. 
A supplier is something different than an administrator. A supplier just fulfills an order, while an administrator makes decisions, but when a machine is sophisticated enough, it can shop for supplies at different suppliers on its own, pay by itself with Bitcoin and does not need to bother the owner or administrator with such simple tasks. An autonomous electric car could make a decision on its own, which charger or car wash to select based on price, location and traffic.
 


Netting of todays financial services is slow, inflexible, involves counter party risk and requires middlemen. Payment channels are fast (if there is no dispute channels can be closed immediately and payment clears), the time frame can be agreed between users, has no counter party risk and does not require middlemen.

From the paper:
*In terms of counter measures against mirroring, several approaches can be taken at various levels. At the hardware level more robust authentication should be used rather than a  proprietary interface. At the  software  level, a challenge-response authentication could be used to prevent access to NAND  memory  or  replay  attacks.  At  the  usability  level, users  should  use  at  least  6-digit  passcodes,or  better  8-character   passcodes.   Attacking   such   passcodes   would require  access  to  the SoC  directly  to  reduce  the  waiting time between attempts.*
Another solution would be integrating important security functions into the SoC. Then things like a passcode fail counter/timer can't be manipulated by restoring the NAND flash memory chip.

For creating a loan you don't need a commercial bank. Lenders will do the job. They already do, but can't compete against the banks, because they can create credit out of collateral (fractional reserve), which lenders can't.

A Merkle root is 32 bytes and a resulting hash is 32 bytes too. That takes a few tens of ms even on a slow Internet connection. That two hashes are found within the same time frame, that is very rare. So the latency of the hashing itself is not that critical. Broadcasting the blocks is much more critical, but this is done by the pools (Bitcoin Relay Network).

I agree with your statement that successful commerce requires law and government, but a government in market capitalism does not manage the economy. This is true in central planning, socialist economies.  The government provides a framework, but successful commerce depends on the economic actors and their freedom. They decide what is most profitable for them, not a government. Also, I am not claiming that Bitcoin will replace fiat (which could be done only by force), but it is becoming the dominant currency in commerce, because it is more efficient to use than the Dollar. Capitalism has always absorbed more efficient business models, because it generates higher profits.  If you try to restrict the freedom of the economic actors, the economy will become less efficient and falls back.

This is simply false. There are many miners pointing their hashpower to big mining pools. Yes, you can disrupt mining, but only temporarily, and will damage the own economy most. If a big pool is shut down, the miners reorganize. Mining equipment will find it's way to other locations. It is a totally permissionless business, none controls the hashrate, you only need electricity and a miner.
Also miners are just servants of the network, they do not control the network, but the full nodes do. They verify the consensus protocol, if a miner changes the consensus protocol, the block will be rejected by the network. The power of miners is vastly overstated. The same applies to any production, if China shuts downs iPhone production, Apple will find a different location.

*The  iPhone  5c  device being analyzed  in  this  research project  was  far  from  the  latest  Apple phones.  Since  then several  new  models  were  introduced  such  as  iPhone  5s, iPhone  6  and  6s,  iPhone  SE  and  iPhone  7.  However, iPhone  5s  and  6  use  the  same  type  of  NAND  Flash memory devices.  It  would  be  logical  to  test  them  against mirroring.  For  models  from  iPhone  6s  more  sophisticated hardware  will  be  required  because  they  use high  speed serial NAND Flash chips with a PCIe interface.*

This is not the only way. Reward halving reduces energy consumption at a constant price or energy consumption stays constant at a rising price (depending on the  rate of growth), since a miner can't spend more on electricity than the income from mining.

Deflation is an amplified problem of fractional reserve, when banks create credit as a multiple of money in existence. In economic downturns banks create less new credit than old credit is destroyed at the same time. If the net credit creation is negative, it is called deflation. It means the money supply shrinks, which makes it harder to serve old credit, the same amount of debt is chasing less new money supply, prices decline as consequence because of increased competition between debtors. Near zero makes it attractive to depositors to withdraw money from banks in cash (hoarding), which reduces the reserves of the banks and can even drive the banking system into bankruptcy (bank run), because the deposits of privates is a multiple of the money in existence. Reduced reserves and the threat of bank runs discourages credit creation even more, reinforcing the deflationary forces which leads very likely into a deflationary spiral.  
In contrast, in a full reserve system, the money supply in such a scenario does not shrink, because banks lend out only money in existence, thus money does not get destroyed when debt is serviced. Banks can pay out all deposits and don't go bankrupt through a bank run, since the money in possession of a bank is equal to the amount of deposits. Hoarding happens too, but the consequences are less severe. 
As one can see, hoarding is not a specific problem of Bitcoin, it happens in nowadays fiat too, and the consequences there are more severe or can be even catastrophic for the monetary system and as a consequence for the economy. Therefore, the maintainers of this system (mainly central banks) try to create constant inflation (nonetheless deflation happens in fiat systems), which makes it less attractive to hoard cash in order to prevent a catastrophic event. These measures are essentially wealth confiscation from the public.

When bad businesses which did bad business decisions, were negligent ore were even part of an organized scam, get bailed out, then you abolish accountability. 
Printing money does only cover up the losses with other peoples money through inflation, since wealth can't be printed. Instead of clawing back the salaries and boni, the losses get socialized. 
Commercial banks have an interest to increase the money supply, since it increases their profits. This is the root cause of increasing the money supply. A fixed money supply would work, just not for the banks. 
The political problems of the Soviet Union were practically non-existent, since it was a dictatorship ( I grew up there). When I compare to the political situation in the US the Soviet Union was very stable - that is the "advantage" of a dictatorship. The Soviet Union did not collapse because of political unrest, but problems due to an inefficient economy.  A bad business got always money from the government, if it considered them systemically important. No one was really accountable for business decisions or use of resources. The US decided to go pretty much the same way in 2008, since the government decided that banks are systemically too important (TBTF) ... instead letting a free market sort out the bad actors.

"money" is always created before value is added, not afterwards. You got it the wrong way. There is no central bank counting produced goods and services and then printing money based on their assessments. Goods and services produced are a result of credit creation by commercial banks. When more credit gets destroyed (through servicing debt) than new credit is created  (through new loans), then we are a in a deflationary phase. Central banks can only try to stimulate credit creation through monetary policy, but they can't force privates to take out loans. In recessions or economic depressions the government will jump in and start spending programs by issuing new debt, which will indeed lead to printing money, since it is accepted as collateral by central banks or bought outright by them (QE). But, again, printing money is just a secondary effect, it does not lead to economic activity itself.

Sure, when you can lend the same amount of gold multiple times, it makes it a lot easier for banks to create profits, but it is actually a scam. Unless you make it legal by law. 
 &gt; When gold and silver were the only forms of money, in order to lend you needed to actually acquire the gold and silver you wanted to lend in the first place. This could take generations of wealth accumulation. Furthermore, you couldn't lend more money than what you actually had which greatly limited the supply of lending. 
Unlimited lending leads to a ton of problems as we know (see 1929, 2008 US, bubble popping early 1990s Japan aso.). Of course, limited lending will bring economic growth to a near halt. But this is mandatory anyway, if mankind want's to survive the next 500 years. The world economy simply can't grow the next 500 years at the same rate as it did the last 500 years, otherwise the planet will be destroyed and it becomes uninhabitable. 




This makes no sense. Why would fractional reserve banking make lending less risky? You have the risk of the default of the debtor losing actual money or gold, no matter if it is a full or fractional reserve system. In a gold standard with fractional reserve the bank would have to pay a loan default with their own capital (gold), in a non-gold standard with fractional reserve the bank would have to pay a loan default with their own capital (fiat), hey can't just write of the loan. Everything else would be accounting fraud.




I appreciate the wealth that fractional reserve brought to society, but this can't go on forever, since we don't have the resources to pay for all this wealth. We have to limit ourselves and a full reserve system in consensus can accomplish that in a capitalist way. Everything else would require socialism or communism.


Crypto is highly liquid form of money, you can send it around the globe efficiently in less than an hour. With LN even more efficiently within in seconds, while it takes days to transfer fiat money via central banks, even longer when doing international money transfers. I don't think there are Bitcoin maximalists who want to limit its liquidity properties. 


To a certain degree there will be IOUs with bitcoin, but it will be negligible. The reason why nowadays banking can exist, is because most of deposits are held with banks because of the utility and security banks provide and the system creates constant inflation for which depositors were historically compensated by banks. Bitcoin provides these functions in software nor does it force inflation, so many of the prerequisites for fractional reserve banking are simply not given.

Majority of tx will go over LN, most people will keep funds on LN for lifetime, simply because the technology will be trusted like Bitcoin blockchain is trusted today.

Also, take the other applications like side chains into account.

Sorry for being pedantic. To make it accurate, it should read: "And that interest is an incentive to **deposit** money in the bank so that the bank can make loans right?" Otherwise it would lead to imagination, that deposited money is stored in the bank, which is not the case. A deposit is simply a claim against the bank, the bank uses the money from deposits to pay its obligations the next moment. 
Deposits are an incentive to move the cash back into the bank, otherwise the system would break, since claims against the banks are a multiple of available money and bank reserves. Essentially banking is a shell game.

Fractional reserve has been done for many centuries during gold &amp; silver standards. In fractional reserve the money supply can shrink when less new loans are taken out than old loans are payed back due to economic declines. This causes a shortage of money and creates price deflation inhibiting new credit creation even more and can create a lot of ripple effects like bank failures and bank runs. Fractional reserve was done in gold &amp; silver standards, because using paper notes were more convenient and secure than using physical gold in everyday payments. People trusted the custodians of their gold, but the custodians abused the situation that physical gold was rarely claimed. This is how this system of dishonest money all began.
The problems of shrinking money supply and their effects do not exist in a full reserve system, since money supply does not change through loan creation or loan payments. Bitcoin is a full reserve system, since it can be transferred p2p and is very transparent. No one would trust an IOU on bitcoin, when transmitting actual bitcoins is easy and cheap.

Interest for new loans comes from interest payments on old loans. Interest payments to a bank do not end up in a black hole, but paid out to depositors and shareholders. There is always enough money for interest payments. You are right only for the very last loan if all loans were paid back. The problem of debt based money is not the interest, but the accumulated surpluses of the economically successful people. They do not need to touch their savings so this money will never be available to service debt for others. The only way out of a collapse of fiat based money is a positive feedback loop, where commercial banks create credit at about the same or faster rate as earned money flows into savings.

The amount of FDIC covered demand deposits (money which can be withdrawn at any time) is at $1.5 trillion. The fund balance of the FDIC in order to cover a test of bank deposits is at $75 billion. If you do the math, the claim is not exaggerated.

A stable coin is even worse than a cleared fiat transfer. A stable coins remains a claim against a private issuer (probably even in a different jurisdiction), while you can withdraw a cleared fiat transaction in cash and have no counter party risk at all.

Credit contractions happen all the time. In fractional reserve it even leads to contraction of money supply since more credit gets destroyed than new credit is created. As I pointed out in earlier comments, a contraction of money supply leads to more severe consequences, with the potential to bring the economy into a deflationary downward spiral without economic reason due to a positive feedback loop. On the way up, we are in a positive feedback loop too, since loan creation leads to increase of reserves and allows to increase loan supply even more aso. It leads to overheating of the economy, because there is no control loop with negative feedback. 
In a full reserve system all money will never be lent out completely, since old loans are paid back and do not stay forever in the economy. There will be always funds for new loans available. The interest rates will bring supply and demand in balance like in any other functioning market. High rates discourage borrowers, demand for loans shrink, while it stimulates lenders and  supply grows. If the supply grows too fast, interest rates will come down, it stimulates borrowing until the system gets in balance again. It is a nice control loop with negative feedback. Basic needs are paid from income or savings and not loans, so no one would starve in economic down cycles. If people need to buy food on loans, they did something else wrong in the first place. The tradition of saving money for bad times got unfortunately abandoned in the US. It is true that the overall loan amount cannot grow constantly in such a system, so will the economy, but this is required anyway to preserve the resources on the planet and not exhaust them.

Heat from gold mining is lost too, not an argument. In contrast, heat from Bitcoin mining can be and IS used to heat buildings etc. This is hardly possible with gold mining. It is true that the energy is lost by physics standards, but by economic standards this energy creates a permanent burden for circumventing or manipulating the blockchain. You don't seem to understand the process of mining correctly. Mining is not simply the creation of new coins by wasting energy, mining secures primarily the transactions on the blockchain. The result of the mining is a cryptographic hash, from which the coins derive its value. The harder it will be (the more energy you need) to create a hash the more valuable the coins get. Certainly there is a marginally productivity for that, the market will find that out. So the energy is not simply burned up, it creates a useful function. Like the accumulation of gold atoms with high purity creates a permanent burden for someone trying to counterfeit gold. I never claimed the energy can be retrieved somehow. Like you pointed out, this is impossible by the 2nd law of thermodynamics.

Bitcoin drops hard, because it is free market capitalism, it doesn't get bailed out by the tax payer and the printing press. The latter is a very real symptom of failing capitalism which are fucking economic and empirical facts and by no means a conspiracy theory. Fiat money is not sustainable, because it works only as a positive feedback loop (which is proven by empirical evidence and simple logic and math) and requires endless expansion until it fails like any positive feedback system through lack of resources. This regime creates unsustainable economic growth, because it will blow up the planet within a few hundred years. Bitcoin with its limited supply will slow down economic growth and therefore the better choice of an economic model for mankind, at least for individuals who have some brain left.

Capitalism never failed, it always invents itself in a new way. Marx' ideas never worked, as I have experienced myself long enough. That there are owners of production is not a problem as long society pursues meritocratic ideas, which allows the most capable and motivated to become owners of production. As long as wealth rotates fast enough in society, wealth inequality is not a problem. The problem of capitalism is the oligarchic structures of society, which prevents a wealth transfer of the rich to the capable and motivated. Bitcoin is going to change that, because it will diminish the wealth of the oligarchic class through the rise of a completely new asset class, which is mostly not in their hands.

The Bitcoin protocol itself has never been hacked. Successful attacks were mostly social engineering attacks, especially of centralized businesses like exchanges, or computer hacks of unsafe OS. These attacks are not specific to Bitcoin, they happen with traditional banking too. 
FDIC has nothing to do with hacks, attacks or robbery. It is an insurance against the consequences of a bank run in a fractional reserve system. Bitcoin is a full reserve system, such insurance would not be needed. 


That is true for any holdings, not specific to Bitcoin. I have ever heard about people boasting about their fiat holdings here. Bitcoin is a fully transparent system, you can see all the holdings on addresses.

If a bank has enough own capital they can recoup their losses through future profits.

In a free market yes, but we have something called QE going on for 10 years now. Federal Reserve would just substitute Chinese buyers. Even if China dumped all their treasury notes, which is unlikely because they would hurt themselves in multiple ways, the Federal Reserve would take care of it. Although, more printing through QE devalues the Dollar, other central banks will follow suit, because a weak Dollar hurts their economies. So forget about that "weapon", it might cause some short term effects for the US economy only. But one thing is for sure, the clear winner during the next QE orgy will be ________.

Not the same effect. Banks have to deposit government bonds in order to borrow cash from the central bank. Everything else would be accounting fraud. Since the banks never hold 100% reserves, but only a small fraction of their deposits as reserves (fractional reserve) a run on the bank can wipe out their reserves very quickly and the bank fails. Otherwise bank runs or capital depletion would never be a problem and the FDIC would be nonsense.

"Here’s the problem … while the number of Bitcoins that will ever be in circulation is capped, there’s absolutely nothing to prevent the creation of another cryptocurrency to bleed off at least some of that price-inflating demand for Bitcoin."
This argument has been debunked so many times. Obviously, the author hasn't much understanding of Bitcoin as well as economics. The value of Bitcoin is created through utility and network effect. Once a certain technology has penetrated the market, it is very hard for an even slightly superior technology to take over, simply because it is lagging. Although you can easily replicate the software (Open Source, MIT license), you cannot replicate the money to build and run the network. In order to have something with similar utility and therefore similar value, which could dilute Bitcoin, you would need a network with similar performance (mainly hash power) from start. This is not impossible but makes little sense economically.

Don't fall for the FUD. Quantum can break ECDSA, that's true, but there is an effective countermeasure: use addresses only once for transmit, which most wallets already do. If quantum computers become so powerful, that they can crack ECDSA in less than 10-60 minutes, they could do double spends (if the effort is rewarding at all), but ECDSA can be replaced with a quantum-proof scheme long before that. For symmetric schemes like sha2 quantum computers make out of a 2^160 problem a 2^80 problem, but no one knows if such quantum computers can be built at scale. Even if, they might not be as efficient in terms of cost and power consumption compared to ASICs. If they become more efficient than ASICs, they will be used for mining, because it will be the most rewarding thing to do with them.

Money has not to clear, if the ATM is with the same institution. The withdrawal cost you a fee, if you use an ATM of a different institution. This fee is essentially an insurance premium, because the institution of the ATM gives a cash loan to the bank they get a claim against for the withdrawal. Some institutions operate joined cash pools, which lowers the ATM fee or waives it completely, because the risk is mostly symmetric. In addition, the ATMs have withdrawal limits in order to limit the risks.

They do it in a roundabout fashion somehow, that is true, but nonetheless they increase the deposits by making up the difference through credit creation. Since the difference is not there before the loan, it allows them to create more deposits, because loan payouts become deposits of others. If they would only lend the deposits, then they could not do that. "Lending deposits" is also a false description, since when a bank makes a loan, the deposits are not blocked by the bank. Having deposits for making loans is just a regulatory requirement, but it is not enforced in reality. Since deposits are not blocked, they can be withdrawn by the depositor at any time. A bank could end up with more loans than they have in deposits. In normal times the banks do not face such a problem, since the loans become additional deposits. It is like a positive feedback loop.  
The roundabout explanation is just a complicated way to explain the same thing, but essentially banks **create loans** out of collateral thus increasing deposits.

Exchanges have no bank licenses. When you deposit fiat with an exchange, they use their account with a bank. Even if too much money flows to the bank of the exchange, banks can open exchanges too and reverse the flow of money. Also, money deposited with an exchange is used to buy cryptocurrency. The seller will withdraw his money to his bank, which reverses the flow of money too.

This is a very logical measure by the BCH supporters. Since difficulty of BTC went up by 20%, BCH was suddenly more profitable to mine than BTC. We know from official statements by BCH miners, that they are subsidizing their chain (mining on a 30% less profitable chain, which makes no sense economically) in order to maintain utility and prevent oscillation. Now that spam since the BTC difficulty adjustment wasn't enough in order to drive up the fees into an equilibrium of mining profitability. BCH is more profitable and miners jumped into it and driving up hashrate 3x. This will reverse when either the BTC fees go up further or latest after the difficulty adjustment of BCH in 1d 10h. The oscillation is still active, it got just damped with a lot of money since Aug 28.

Since commercial banks created a multiple of deposits than available cash and for cash redeemable reserves (reserve ratio), there must be a **mechanism to keep money inside the banking system and prevent leaving it**: banks pay interest on deposits  while in return the majority of claims on cash (deposits) is held within the banking system. Otherwise the system breaks, since cash and for cash redeemable reserves can never cover the claims of the bank customers. Inflation is simply a requirement for the credit creation model of banking in order to function.

Right, aggregated saving in an economy does never change. If someone invests, someone else divests, for every buyer there is a seller. No matter if you have a debt based fiat system or a full reserve system with Bitcoin, the saving (hoarding) is always equal to the money supply. Only the consequences of saving outside the banking system (stashing money under the mattress) in a fractional reserve system can be catastrophic, since the savings are a multiple of money in existence. In contrast, full reserve system does not break by "stashing money under the mattress".

[Central bank assets inflation (growth of base money) is growing exponentially while yields are on a historic low]( The mechanism to control inflation has already failed, we just don't feel it yet.

Increasing number of shares in the bank books dilute the share price, since the supply of tradable shares increases.  That they are not a part of market cap calculation statistics, does not change this situation.
Some regulation changed, that is true, but before that FTD naked shorts had voting rights and they still have since they were "grandfathered".
I am not claiming that naked short selling is an illegal practice in general, but when a naked short becomes FTD, then it is very likely that naked short selling was done in an abusive way. Technology could change that, but Wall St is not interested, since they profit from it.
FTD can be sold long again, since they are additional shares created by the naked shorts in the first place. If you bought some shares in your account, you don't know and they are not tagged if the seller was selling long, short or naked short, so you can sell them agian. Not surprising. Nonetheless FTD are an increase of supply, since they are tradable like any other share.

This is what's called "book money", money which doesn't exists, but just claims on it. You can buy things with "book money", but it involves counter party risk (since it is a liability of a private bank).

Also "book money" is not durable and fungible at all, several main properties of money are missing.

2/3 of all fiat currencies in history have failed. I think this is sufficient evidence. That fiat currencies fail economically, is very natural, because the government interferes with force (fiat) and does not let the market rule. The creation of credit leads to more creation of credit, essentially it is a positive feedback loop system. When you look at historical data of the Dollar, you will notice that credit creation gets less and less productive, meaning that credit grows at a higher rate than GDP (marginal productivity of debt). This must lead to price inflation inevitably and it is a process which can't be reversed, otherwise the system collapses similar to a chain mail system. In the end no government can bypass the laws of economics and math, they can only buy time to stretch the system.

The amount of shares for a particular company is fixed, but it doesn't prevent brokers to short sell shares which don't exists. Naked short sellers essentially create shares out of nothing. The number of shares held in accounts can outnumber the shares issued, because these shares show up in accounts, have voting rights, but were never delivered (FTD = failed to deliver). This is not only a temporary "phenomena", but a persistent problem over many years, since naked short sellers can simply roll over the FTD with new naked shorts. All has been studied well.

They have been even seriously considering that for a long time. It will be the last resort of official FED policy to avoid a deflationary downward spiral. "Like gold, U.S. dollars have value only to the extent that they are strictly limited in supply. But the U.S. government has a technology, called a printing press (or, today, its electronic equivalent), that allows it to produce as many U.S. dollars as it wishes at essentially no cost. By increasing the number of U.S. dollars in circulation, or even by credibly threatening to do so, the U.S. government can also reduce the value of a dollar in terms of goods and services, which is equivalent to raising the prices in dollars of those goods and services. We conclude that, under a paper-money system, a determined government can always generate higher spending and hence positive inflation."

I don't know if that is really better. Both options are ways to reduce bandwidth. -maxuploadtarget cuts off older blocks to all nodes, while -maxconnections just restricts the number of connections, but provides full service. In case too many nodes used  -maxuploadtarget, it would be hard for new nodes to get started (receiving blocks older than a week). 
In contrast, -maxconnections=12 (which is quite low, I use 32) allows 4 nodes from a single node to get all blocks.

"One money" is the main cause of the Euro crisis, because each member state still has its own independent budget. Reckless governments are temped to spend too much, especially when there is no inflation backlash (inflation is spread over all Euro countries and therefore hardly felt). When the debt level becomes unsustainable, these governments can't print their way out anymore like they have always done in the past. The ECB has to step in, but it gets power over the states, because it can demand austerity, which causes social unrest, political instability and finally a strong anti-EU sentiment. The only way out is to unite the Euro zone countries and transfer the budget power (spending and taxes) to a federal government (finally taking sovereignty away legally). Otherwise the Euro is doomed to fail. To have a new currency ready, which replaces the Euro is actually not a bad idea.

This works as long as the members trust each other. Trust can evaporate for various reasons quickly. E.g. one member goes bankrupt, its share price tanks, its liabilities might never be fulfilled. What will the tokens be worth then (since they are not backed by a neutral asset)? For sure your tokens need to be valued to an external currency like the Dollar. In addition this system requires permissions, and a central authority in order to delegate permissions, review its use and prevent abuse. This system doesn't use the trustless, permissionless and decentralized benefits of the Bitcoin blockchain.

Co-location of mining with power plants makes sense. Since most power outages are caused by grid failures, power plants have to go into an emergency shut-down, because the sudden load drop would lead to a damage or even destruction of the power generation facilities. If there is a consumer of the electrical energy next to the power plant and not on the grid, the load loss due to a grid failure is not as severe. Such a mining operation can provide a base load beneficial for a power plant, since it does not need to go into an emergency shut-down, but only throttle the output. Mining operations could also be used for energy demand management. During sudden demand peaks of the grid they could be shut down within milliseconds in order to avoid an overload of the power generation plant and therfore prevent grid failures.

"governments will issue digital fiat that functions similarly to cryptocurrency"
It will function like crypto, but it will not be crypto, simply because you have to trust the central bank and government and not a decentralized system defined by cryptographic rules.
 
In addition, digital fiat will make most of the banking system obsolete, since you don't need banks for transmitting and receiving money anymore. Banks won't be able to create credit, because the public will prefer digital fiat over bank issued IOUs on digital fiat, simply because the utility is the the same, but bank issued IOUs bear counter party risk. For the same reason the public will not deposit their digital fiat with banks. It all will bring the fractional reserve rules based banking to a grinding halt, the central bank has to become the only and ultimate lender. Essentially the monetary system is put upside down, it becomes a full reserve system, since all credit will be issued as cash in form of digital fiat by the central bank. Since a central bank can create as much digital cash as needed, they do not take any risk by giving out loans, therefore they are not economically accountable for defaulting loans, which will lead to money creation policy driven solely by politics, not by market economics. 
The irony is, that any attempt by central banks and governments to catch up with or counter cryptocurrencies, will lead to an accelerated downfall of the fiat system.

In the current regime increasing currency in circulation has little to do with economic growth. Only privates can fuel growth by increasing the money supply through credit creation by private banks. Old wisdom says, that you can lead a horse to a pond, but you can't force it drink. Either it won't or it can't drink. The same is true for debtors, if they won't (because they feel uncomfortable about economic outlook) or can't  (because income constrains it), more money gets destroyed than created (deflationary cycle). Central banks can only shift the aggregates within the money supply (QE), but they can't increase the economically relevant money supply, if the privates don't cooperate. Otherwise monetary policy measures would have been greatly successful (Japan has been trying for 20 years now).  From that it is obvious that monetary policies already fail without that Bitcoin has a significant influence. Economist should rather analyze why the current system is failing and find out if Bitcoin is an alternative to a war and command economy and a solution to the current problem and by establishing a new, market oriented monetary regime.

Yes there are rules, defined by the Bitcoin protocol.
Watch these videos. Why created Bitcoin wallets will never be taken:   Paperwallets:
Bitcoin is based on public-key cryptography, a method which has been well known since the 1970s. 
You sign a transaction with your private key and the resulting signature is verified by the miners. This way "blockchain knows" that your private key works, although you never reveal it. 
Bitcoin derives the Bitcoin address (which has to be made public in order to receive payments) from your private key, so it will always match unless the wallet software is fundamentally broken.

You don't understand it either. The term fiat derives from the Latin fiat ("let it be done") used in the sense of an order, decree or resolution. The power defines what money is, this is the essential feature of fiat money. The power can define any material or information as money, even gold as it was done during the gold standard in many countries. So fiat doesn't mean inherently the money has no intrinsic value. Also the term "intrinsic" is moot. There is no intrinsic value of material by nature, it all depends on human perception. The only value which can be measured objectively is the cost to produce it. Everything else is supply and demand against legal tender in a market (which also depends on supply and demand of legal tender). Most gold has no practical use anyway, 85% if all gold sits useless in vaults. If this gold was sold as conductive material, its price would be plummeting. BTW, silver and copper are even better conductive materials than gold. And they can be melted down at about the same temperature. So this was really an uneducated argument.

Money itself does not deplete resources, but debt does. We have a debt based money (money=debt) that is growing exponentially without any limits. Also sustainability in an exponentially growing system is a contradiction. All the "climate accord" and "fight global warming"  bullshit is just kool-aid, but the destruction of our habitat goes on. These kool-aids just postpone the side effects, but they make it worse in the long term, since they do not abolish exponential growth.

Hoarding doesn't matter, because banks increase the money supply constantly, even faster than economic growth. 
Money can't disappear, because when someone buys into an investment, somebody else sells that investment. In this economy 17 trillion Dollars are hoarded and increased credit creation inflates the "hoarding" amount even more. 
"Excessive hoarding results in an economic stall."
The "hoarding" argument defeats itself.

Forget the news on prices, they are just picked to match a price development afterwards. Bitcoin is mainly a technology and a paradigm change in way that it represents an asset at the same time. The difference is that Bitcoin as a medium of exchange and store of value does not need government or central power (laws, regulation and protection of property rights) in order to exist, but just technology (encryption). The only precedent in human history I can think of is gold and precious metals, but they couldn't match the requirements of modern commerce due limits of divisibility and transportability (especially after the invention of long distance communication, e.g. telegraph).

The described MIM attack is not impossible, but very unrealistic. It requires that the user does transmit to the same address (exchanges generate a new address for every transaction) repeatedly and the user's computer or phone got compromised in order to flip the tx address. Also, the last digits are a checksum of the Bitcoin address, which would require to find checksum collisions in addition. I guess, that makes brute forcing of such address collisions by order of magnitudes more expensive than he claims. Besides that, the address display format could be changed by a simple firmware upgrade.

The greatest misconception of most economists is that, according to their theories, economy is based on barter. One such expression is "money velocity", which is praised as indicator of economic health, but if you take a look at "money velocity", which is collapsing since 2009, the economy is improving - at least according to those economists. And the reason for their ignorance is not lack of academic skills and knowledge, but they had to admit that fiat money is giant pyramid scheme. Elites are profiting from that and they have no interest in revealing the true nature of our economics, but rather have been creating "smoke and mirrors". As Henry Ford stated: "It is well enough that people of the nation do not understand our banking and monetary system, for if they did, I believe there would be a revolution before tomorrow morning."

And you understand that increased money supply means increased hoarding? It only increases price inflation. (The only "useful" effect of inflation is that it keeps the money in the banking system, otherwise it would get destroyed.)

Money has not to clear, if the ATM is with the same institution. The withdrawal cost you a fee, if you use an ATM of a different institution. This fee is essentially an insurance premium, because the institution of the ATM gives a cash loan to the bank they get a claim against for the withdrawal. Some institutions operate joined cash pools, which lowers the ATM fee or waives it completely, because the risk is mostly symmetric. In addition, the ATMs have withdrawal limits in order to limit the risks. 
@_date: 2019-09-19 00:00:59




No, that is not correct and that is why banks have to have reserves. Bank's A reserves are reduced by 10k and banks B reserves are increased by 10k at the end of the day. As long as they keep the minimum required reserve, they don't need to do anything. Only if the reduction of reserves of bank A would go below the minimum reserve requirement, they had to borrow cash from somewhere.

Only to some minor degree, since blockchains need the economic model of cryptocurrency in order to function properly. Some who don't understand the technology believe that they can strip the cryptocurrency part off, but then it becomes a distributed databases essentially - something which has been invented long before. 


No, that are facts. E.g. Krugman, Stiglitz, Rogoff and Roubini do it. These are Keynesians who believe in central power and government force in order to direct the economy - something completely contrary to the idea of decentralization and libertarian ideas.

Banks create credit (inflate their balance sheet), but not cash or for cash redeemable reserves (money). Reserves are only a fraction of their balance sheet, and reserves are accumulated through business activities as well as capital injections. Banks can't lend their balance sheet, but part of their reserves and only if they keep enough to satisfy the minimum reserve requirement. 
Interbank transfers happen through exchange of reserves with the central bank. Exchanging physical cash would be impractical, that's why they use their deposited reserves (which is equal to cash) with the central bank.

What's your elaborated explanation for your argument?
@_date: 2018-07-19 17:43:53
Credit inflation is caused, because in the current system banks can create loans out of collateral. When a bank receives the title for a house, they put it on their balance sheet as claim and can create a loan by simply increasing the amount of money in a customer's account. Of course, this is a bit oversimplified and there are rules and regulations, which limit the credit creation through reserve requirements, lending standards, demand through interest rates aso. but this makes no essential difference to the fact that banks create loans (=inflate credit=inflate money supply)  out of collateral. This is all possible, because the current monetary system is fractional reserve, which means that IOUs or claims on money can be a multiple of the actual money in existence. Fractional reserve works because it is for individuals and businesses more convenient to keep money with the banks and use their money services instead of using cash. As soon as we don't need the banks for their money services anymore through a digital currency, fractional reserve collapses.

In other words, QC is valuable for a government only, if all other assume no government has it, but a public demonstration of it would render it mostly worthless for a government.

In this chart the share of SegWit transactions per block is depicted, which is equal to SegWit tx divided by overall tx. It can never grow over 100%, so applying a linear growth rate on the percent is more a rough guess. It will more likely an S-curve and grow exponentially until it reaches 50% and then invert to logarithmic growth and it will probably never reach 100% or it will take a very long time for that, so 100% SegWit usage rate is a very bad metric for adoption.  A way better metric would 50%. Calculation is a bit complicated, because more SegWit tx can fit into a block than ordinary tx and this changes with the share of SegWit tx and depends of the structure of the transactions. Therefore I simplify that the pure SegWit growth rate is 2% per day ([180 SegWit tx per block /50 days]/180 SegWit tx per block = 0.02) and assume an exponential growth of Segwit transactions (= number of SegWit tx grows at the same percentage rate). I just guess that 1300 SegWit tx per block equals about 50% (I am too lazy to calculate the exact number and assume blocks are full) and then it takes about 100 days to reach 50% from start (1.02^100 ~= 1300/180), which is about mid of November 2017 (or about 3.3 months).

What you mean by entries in computer databases (bank deposits, electronic checks aso.) are IOUs on Dollars, but not Dollars. Such IOUs are not legal tender nor money, but just claims on it.  


This is, as I said, a very superficial explanation. It is more complicated than that. Only the Federal Reserve can create USD and bring them into circulation. Banks borrow cash from the Federal Reserve in order to satisfy the demand for legal tender. They can do it only, if a Federal Reserve bank receives acceptable collateral in the same amount. The value of the collateral must be the same as the issued Dollars, claims and liabilities must be in balance, that's why it is called a balance sheet (which is published). It is true that banks keep a big portion of their reserves with the Federal Reserve, so these do not need to be printed right away, but upon demand of their customers (withdrawal) they must be printed. There is simply not such a thing as a "digital Dollar" in existence, which a bank can pay you out at withdrawal, they can pay out paper notes only.  What you mean by "digital Dollar" are claims on Dollars sitting either as cash in vaults or as reserves with the Federal Reserve. These claims have only value, if the reserves are exchanged. You cannot transfer a "digital Dollar" cross country or even abroad, in the end the actual money has to be carried to the destination.

Understandable from the standpoint of private banks, since a CBIDC would make them obsolete for the most part. You could exchange Dollars directly between individuals and businesses, so you would not need banks for money transactions anymore. Banks would lose deposits and could not create credit anymore. The central bank had to create credit to individuals and businesses and the Dollar became a full reserve system. It is simply not compatible with the current system as long as you want to have credit creating private banks.

Right, the fiat monopoly is part of the problem, which prevents competition in various ways. I agree, that in a sanctioned environment such a business is much more profitable, while in a competitive environment it is less interesting for a capitalist like Buffett. Such cronyism is part of misguided capitalism. Bitcoin is changing that by providing similar utility  by circumventing the entry gates into that business. That there is no Bitcoin corporation that generates profits and pays dividends does not make this service useless. In contrast, it makes it even more efficient by revolutionizing the ownership structure of businesses. Private corporations can still make money through e.g. mining. It's just a new paradigm and Buffett fails to understand that completely for obvious reasons.

Sorry, I missed your "directly".  Central banks in most states incl. US, UK or Japan are not allowed buy on the primary market, but on the second market only. So this is not specific to the EU. Central banks including the ECB have been buying government bonds with freshly printed money for years, thus increasing the money supply and bringing rates down.

Although the ECB reduced the monthly amount they are buying, they still increase their balance sheet.

"inflation is good" it is a requirement to keep a fractional reserve banking scheme going, otherwise banks would run dry quickly and go bankrupt as soon as there reserves are depleted.

A blockchain in the current monetary system is just an IT upgrade and has no significant advantage over databases. Instead of managing their IUOs in a database, they would do it on a blockchain, but they still have to trust each other, which they do very poorly. Banks mainly rely on the central bank system for exchanging collateral (cash and reserves) in order to back or clear their IOUs, which is either slow (net clearing once a day M-F) or expensive (RTGS). To really improve things, central banks had to issue cryptocurrencies, so banks could transmit them p2p as collateral in real time. But then also privates and businesses could interact p2p with contracts and money (smart contracts) and cut out the banks. You see that blockchain is a catch-22 situation for banks.

*A peculiar monetary institution emerged during the period of interregnum in Somalia from January 1991 to August 2012. Without a functioning government to restrict the supply of notes in circulation, Somalis found it profitable to contract with foreign printers and import forgeries.

However, the purchasing power eventually stabilized at the cost of producing additional notes.*

The time it takes to find the next hash varies. It is not fixed, only the average time is 10 minutes, but it can take any time from near zero to near infinite time theoretically. The poison distribution expresses the probability of a certain duration of a time interval until the next hash is found. The estimated hash rate is the difficulty divided by an average time interval (e.g. of the last 6 blocks) multiplied by a constant. Due to a limited number of time intervals for averaging and the random distribution of the time intervals can be a better guess only and it varies a lot, even if the actual hash power remains absolutely constant (that's why we see these wild oscillations in hash rate). It would be very hard to measure the actual hash power, you had to know how many miners with what specific performance were online at all time.

This is a claim based on money velocity theory, but it does not hold when it comes to logic analysis and empirical evaluation. 
First, if I spend savings, someone else gains savings. It doesn't reduce "unused savings". Secondly, if businesses use that money to pay back their debt, money gets destroyed, so in fact inflation (if that was really the cause for more spending) causes a deflation. 
If you look at the "money velocity", which documents how fast/often money is spent, there is no correlation to economic growth evident. It creates positive short term effects for economic output but that is followed by a period of reduced economic output, because demand is just pulled forward (If I spend my savings now, I have less to spend in future).




This is not how a great majority of lending works. Banks create credit out of collateral, they don't lend savings. I agree, that this will happen at a much slower rate with sound money, but it is a necessity anyway, because mankind doesn't have the resources to sustain another 200 years of economic growth like it was in the last 200 years.


I doubt that such a product is popular. Most people who invest into gold, but not storing it at home, do it over funds which store the gold  in a warehouse. Everything else would be fraud, but not legal. The economic impact you imply isn't there. 


This is pure fiction and I see no reason to abolish redundant competition. In fact, redundant competition keeps arsing monopolies and cartels in check. They are mostly redundant in the product they offer, but not redundant for the functioning of a market and therefore an efficient economy. Socialism ignores economic principles, it can never provide a better economy even if the leaders were 100% honest.

Essentially it is free, since this process (government auction-&gt;primary dealer-&gt;secondary market -&gt; Fed open market operations) is repeated over and over. You just need a few Dollars in cash in order to start this process. 
We haven't  seen inflation yet, since 2008 was a deflationary crisis. In order to prevent a long term fall-out from deflation (contraction of money supply), central bank operations try to compensate for it. 
Central bank policies can only try to influence that, but they regularly fail. Otherwise the 2008 meltdown or any other financial crisis could have been avoided.

ERM was only between later Euro countries. All other currencies floated against each other. I remember well the Dollar crash in 1980. 
A market float is something fundamentally different than a set exchange rate. A market float prevents governments to spend excessively, because their currency will devalue immediately. A set exchange does not prevent governments from this, because there is no immediate devaluation, but in the end they have to devalue in order to avoid a default. The resetting the exchange rate is in consequence a deliberate act by governments, because they cause it actively in the first place (and sometimes in secret, so privates have no clue, because there is no indicator).  When the exchange rate is re-set savers lose real money, although the currency (legal tender) is not replaced. You can call it financial repression, I call it a reset.

It's a note for that a replacement is printed or already available. That has no impact on their balance sheet at all. The amount of money is not defined by how many paper notes exist (there is way more money than notes in existence), but their own assets and the reserves of the banks with the federal reserve. BTW, money gets destroyed when the Federal Reserve takes it out of circulation, not when the notes actually shredded. At the same time the Federal Reserve takes worn notes out of circulation it will bring new notes into circulation. Otherwise it had to reduce its assets (e.g. sell treasuries).

Just look up the numbers with your central bank.

Also, google the paper, it can be found on various sites. Although most of us understand less than 20% of that, they clearly state: "... full promise of quantum computing (e.g. Shor’s algorithm ...) still requires technical leaps to engineer fault-tolerant logical qubits", so it's not only about scaling qubits.

Commercial banks don't loan money out at all. They create credit (liability) against collateral (asset). Money is only used as unit of account and medium of exchange for transferring that credit to another institution or bring it into circulation (cash) if requested.

These reserves pay interest since they are kept as government bonds for the most part.

In the fiat world MZM is much bigger than M0 (actual numbers can be retrieved from the Federal Reserve statistics). MZM = money of zero maturity, which means money that the bank has to pay out on demand in cash the same day. M0 = monetary base, which is all currency in circulation plus the reserves of the banks with the central bank. Banks maintain a fractional reserve for their liabilities only.
Bitcoin deposits (mostly exchanges) amount only to a small portion to total number of bitcoins. Bitcoin "banks" are full reserve "banks", so there is always the same amount of bitcoins compared to the bitcoin deposits (assuming they are honest and not criminal).
So yes,  a run on bitcoin deposits could happen, if depositors don't trust their Bitcoin "bank" anymore, but the consequences are completely different compared to the fiat banks.

The system cornered itself and there is no easy way out of this. The reserves of the commercial banks with the central bank consist mostly of low yielding government debt at a fixed rate. When the central bank rises the funds rate (banks borrow cash at a variable rate) commercial banks get crushed, because the rate spread shrinks or might even go negative. Banks would extract cash from the system and pay it back to the central bank in order to reduce rate payments, which in turn reduces liquidity and - voila - we have a liquidity crisis again (Lehman was all about liquidity, right?). 
The only way banks could sustain higher rates would be by growing their business substantially through more loans  (which would increase their interest income), but unless we get much higher growth rates in credit creation, there is little chance that the central banks can raise the rates.

It explains well, why traditional banking is so inefficient.  But there a a few minor misconceptions in the video. The 97% electronic "money" is not money but only a liability of banks or a claim against banks denoted in money. Do not call it money. Banks do not create money, but IOUs on money. In addition, banks do not create credit out of nothing, but out of collateral. When you get a loan to buy a house, the bank gets ownership of the property via the title. Credit creation does not solely depend on mood of bankers, but economic decisions. If the collateral might lose value (e.g. house prices are going down), the banker is less willing to create credit, because the risk increases that the outstanding balance might get higher than the value of the collateral, which is a systemic risk for the bank going bankrupt and the shareholders of the bank will lose money and the banker his job.

This "cryptocurrency" will be essentially an IOU on cash. This cash needs to be deposited somewhere and then you have to trust the custodians and auditors. We already have trustworthy cash custodians a.k.a. central banks. And what banks doing now (electronic payment system) is such an IOU system, where the cash deposited in the central bank is exchanged between banks. A blockchain does not make it inherently faster, since the current system is based on net clearing which happens only once per business day, not on weekends or holidays. To make it really faster the system had to be a gross settlement system and banks as well as central banks had to be open 24/7. I doubt that a few banks can change the operational system of central banks. Maybe in 20 years central banks are open 24/7, if they still exist then.

* are intransparent and slow at transaction, which allows abusive trading/insider trading
There is no rational reason to give an asset away, which does not have all the disadvantages above for a few percentage points of yield, when B&amp;H yields 100-200% p.a.

This is a doctrine without any proof by most economic schools.  Increasing demand is created by producers of goods and services through marketing and advertisement. It doesn't exist naturally (not in our genes). Mankind had existed tens of thousands of years without an "everyone wants everything" attitude. It changed 5,000 years ago, when debt was introduced. But even today there are societies which live mostly without  an "everyone wants everything" attitude.

Money supply equals debt. The problem with debt based money is that savings have no maturity (you can keep them on your account as long as you wish), but debt has. In order to prevent a collapse like in a pyramid scheme, because part of the existing money supply is blocked for servicing of debt, the system has to increase money supply constantly by issuing more loans in the future compared to the past.

We don't have verifiable numbers yet, but many things can go "wrong" with a bleeding edge process. One explanation could be low yield, which still results in usable chips but at lower performance. Fabs need iterations to adjust a new process to optimum, it is never perfect from start. Mining ASICs are a good test vehicle for that, because they are produced at high volume and are usable with defects (because defect cores can be disabled or ignored). When the fab has brought up their process to optimum, the 10nm ASICs should show a significant improvement in both, power efficiency and manufacturing cost over 16nm chips.

It is a trivial fact that the lack of non-mining nodes makes it a lot easier to enforce a hardfork, since the cost for a 51% attacker of setting up enough full nodes accepting the hardfork is negligible. Wallets have little choice but to upgrade and accept blocks from those full nodes.  
In contrast, if the broad majority of full nodes does not accept a hardfork, the success of it is less likely. Wallets do not have to upgrade and there will be still miners who mine blocks on the valid chain (although slower in the beginning until difficulty adjusts).  
It may look like a side effect, but it's actually an important security feature. Nakamoto made no difference between mining and non-mining nodes, but he did not anticipate this specific scenario, like he did not anticipate many other scenarios. 
*Nodes   always   consider   the   longest   chain   to   be   the   correct   one   and   will   keep   working   on extending it.   If two nodes broadcast different versions of the next block simultaneously, some nodes may receive one or the other first.  In that case, they work on the first one they received, but save the other branch in case it becomes longer.  The tie will be broken when the next proof-of-work   is   found   and   one   branch   becomes   longer;   the   nodes   that   were   working   on   the   other branch will then switch to the longer one.*

This is not how banking works. Banks are creating money and THEN it comes back as deposits. Only the money creation leads to economic activity, not the deposit. The concepts of "banks lending deposits" or "banks multiplying capital" are simply an illusion. There is empirical evidence for that:
*This paper presents the first empirical evidence in the history of banking on the question of whether banks can create money out of nothing. The banking crisis has revived interest in this issue, but it had remained unsettled. Three hypotheses are recognised in the literature. According to the financial intermediation theory of banking, banks are merely intermediaries like other non-bank financial institutions, collecting deposits that are then lent out. According to the fractional reserve theory of banking, individual banks are mere financial intermediaries that cannot create money, but collectively they end up creating money through systemic interaction. A third theory maintains that each individual bank has the power to create money ‘out of nothing’ and does so when it extends credit (the credit creation theory of banking). The question which of the theories is correct has far-reaching implications for research and policy. Surprisingly, despite the longstanding controversy, until now no empirical study has tested the theories. This is the contribution of the present paper. An empirical test is conducted, whereby money is borrowed from a cooperating bank, while its internal records are being monitored, to establish whether in the process of making the loan available to the borrower, the bank transfers these funds from other accounts within or outside the bank, or whether they are newly created. This study establishes for the first time empirically that banks individually create money out of nothing. The money supply is created as ‘fairy dust’ produced by the banks individually, "out of thin air".*

Soviet Union had massive growth and innovation too, they made the transition from a agricultural state into an industrial superpower in a shorter time than the US - despite communism. Their technology was very advanced in certain fields (e.g. first man in space). The problem with communism is economic inefficiency through lack of accountability. This makes a communist economy unsustainable and it will fail in the end. But lack of accountability is a growing problem of capitalism too, when the economic players gain too much political power (e.g. bank bailouts, lobbyism). Technological innovation like Bitcoin is not adopted by the capitalist system yet, because the economic actors with political power do not need to become innovative, because their political power guarantees them their wealth (still). If capitalism wants to survive, it has to stay innovative.

Our monetary systems are essentially positive feedback loop systems. Some call it even a Ponzi or Pyramid scheme. With abolishing commodity standards it would blow up within weeks, if it wasn't regulated by state power and self regulation. Commodity standards of the past did not prevent positive feedback loop effects, but a monetary system based on virtual currency like bitcoin could dampen them significantly, because there is little economic (interest, security) and technical (provide convenient units of exchange and money transmission services) incentive to loan bitcoins to a bank.

It happened in the western world too, but in more subtle ways. 
France was not a failed political system after WW2, but French Franc was devalued multiple times by the government against the Dollar and British Pound (Bretton-Woods). I would call that resets, although in small mild steps:
*After World War II, France devalued its currency within the Bretton Woods system on several occasions. Beginning in 1945 at a rate of 480 francs to the British pound (119.1 to the U.S. dollar), by 1949 the rate was 980 to the pound (350 to the dollar). This was reduced further in 1957 and 1958, reaching 1382.3 to the pound (493.7 to the dollar, equivalent to 1 franc = 1.8 mg pure gold).*
Also the US government devalued the Dollar two times against gold and later abolished the gold standard completely.
History never repeats, but it rhymes. Now governments are considering cash bans which opens some new ways to control the value of money. by force.

TARGET2 does not exchange assets in real time, it's just a payment system between banks within the Euro-Zone. Balances can be carried over for a long time but have to be cleared by central bank redeemable assets one day. The risks and costs of non-cleared balances are just mitigated from the private banks to the central banks of the Euro countries. E.g. Germany has demand for assets at 587 bln Euro while e.g. Italy is liable for assets at 251 billion Euro. When a debtor goes bankrupt the creditor - which is the tax payer - is on the hook for that loss. TARGET2 and other RTGSs do not make the payment systems more efficient and cheaper, because they are just a workaround in order to increase the payment speed of an outdated monetary system.

Money is not created or destroyed by some bureaucrats in order to track wealth, that's a widespread misconception described in some economics books.
"Money" (better credit) is created by private banks out of collateral through loans. Loans need to be paid back (credit is destroyed), which forces debtors to produce and sell - or work - which creates a surplus of goods (=wealth, that debt is not always productive is another story). The surplus needs more money (new debtors) in order to get bought, otherwise the debtor in the first place goes bankrupt. When the banks create more loans, that's not a problem and the system keeps spinning - more loans -&gt; more goods -&gt; more loans -&gt; more goods aso. It's a positive feedback loop which generates economic growth (especially because banks create more new loans than old loans are paid back - constantly increasing money supply). But when creditors get uneasy and cautious with credit creation (they fear defaults), the the whole system cracks. It comes to a turning point, when banks create less new loans, than old loans are paid back.  Debtors are chasing less and less money, it becomes more and more valuable, which creates the deflationary effect and a downward spiral (sinking wages, prices = less collateral ... less credit aso.).

At some point, but not now. But that might be even not necessary, because there will be new ideas. If EB is mature and secure, why not adding that. 


Because it is stupid to go the risky way, when you can go the safe way with the same short term effect. SegWit doesn't block other scaling solutions, it contrast, it opens the gates to a lot more scaling solutions than BU.

The central banks of Germany and England explained the credit creation of private banks very well in their publications.

This is what the Fed wants make you believe. In practise the effect is zero. Or have you seen significant inflation in US, Japan, GB or the Euro-Zone? No. Simply because the overall money supply doesn't increase, while certain components of it might while others do the opposite. It just depends on what you define as money supply. If I have $1,000,000 in treasury notes or in cash does not make a difference, other than the liquidity feature. I can buy a house with both. Using treasury notes just takes a little bit longer, because I have to exchange with cash either on the debt market or at the Federal reserve. If I go to the Federal Reserve QE window, the cash supply in the economy increases, while the treasury notes supply decreases in the economy at the same time. It doesn't make the economy more wealthy, just more liquid.

But banks don't want a Bitcoin copy as E-coin. Most of the talk by journalists, economists and politicians is premature and uneducated. Politicians don't understand the implications of an E-coin (would put the banking system upside down) and economists don't understand what money is (think the Dollar is already bits and bytes, completely ignore that it is based collateral to be exchanged). In contrast, some central banks (e.g. Bank of England) already figured out the implications and are aware that an E-coin would destroy the private banks. Yes, they can make an E-coin which protects banks too, but that would be highly inefficient (like a horse-drawn automobile) and required a lot of changes in law (central bank charters, bank charters, civil law). And then it would be just a national E-coin, because because other countries make their own law. It would need a worldwide collaboration of governments or better a world government to make such a government sanctioned (because you really don't own it) E-coin happen. Expect such a transition to take at least 20 years while Bitcoin might have already taken over the world.

That is just a regulatory measure in order to constrain credit creation, but does not inherently create loans. If there is no real demand for loans in the first place, no credit is created - no matter how much reserves the banks have (reserves are out of circulation and do nothing to the economy). Also it is allowed and happens that there is more reserves than required. In other words, **the banks do not create credit out of reserves (leveraging), it is the privates who demand those loans and provide collateral for that in the first place.** 


Since they are cash like instruments, they have the same relevance economically like cash except for liquidity. So it is still a zero sum game, if the Fed takes UST notes out of circulation and replaces them with cash, so it's neither inflationary nor deflationary. The only thing they do is improving liquidity, but empirical evidence proves that they do little for economic growth (look at Japan). Only real money printing (net money, treasury just prints money and pays with it or gives it out as tax credit) would cause inflationary pressures in an environment with slow credit growth, but high debt burden of the overall economy.
We should concentrate on how the capitalist system works in principal. Regulatory and technical aspects as well as various descriptions in economic text books are mostly redundant in order to understand this. They just contribute to the general confusion about this topic, which is also intended.

QE is not money printing aka Weimar, Zimbabwe or Venezuela. 
It's true that the Federal Reserve buys treasuries from privates with freshly created Dollars. Someone who goes to the Fed gets Federal Reserve notes in exchange for treasury notes. His wealth remains the same, he just more liquid. The same is true for the whole economy. When the government services this treasury debt, these created Dollars are destroyed again.

But how does it improve efficiency, when another technology goes on top of an existing system? I see no rationalization effect when banks replace all their databases with a blockchain. After the initial cost of switching to a blockchain cost reduction for banks must be very low, if there is an advantage at all.  A blockchain does not change their banking or the monetary system fundamentally. Banks still have to do net settling and exchange collateral over the central bank system unless they use bitcoins. When banks used bitcoins and they became the medium of exchange and store of wealth for them, why would customers still need to go to a bank, when they could bypass them?

Miners should act for purely economic reasons, not because they signed something in a closed door meeting agreement many months ago. Next the "economic majority businesses" hold closed door meetings with the authorities on KYC, PoW aso. and could enforce it although the users don't want it. A Bitcoin which follows the planning of central closed door meeting agreements is not censorship resistant anymore. In the end authorities can define Bitcoin and turn it into a fiat currency, because they can hold the businesses hostage. Miners who support this should be aware from early on that they sell their opportunities for cheap, because users bought into a big idea and not just into a method of payment. I think for most of them security is superior to throughput, otherwise they would not use Bitcoin but VISA.

I agree, it reduces counterparty risk, but does not eliminate it.
Let's take trading via blockchain a step further. We can do it p2p without any agent trustlessly.
 &gt; If I tell you I have some shares and wish to sell them, but I intend to fail to deliver then it doesn't matter if I have them nor if I don't deliver in ten minutes or two days.
That is true, but what if I insist that we do the transaction piece by piece, because I do not trust you?  Currently, structuring a transaction into very tiny pieces is not efficient on existing blockchains, but with payment channels on top it can be done (high transaction speed, zero cost except for opening and closing the payment channels on both sides, pls look up payment channels) and - voila - it becomes essentially a trustless trade.

And not to forget the housing bubble. Politicians and central bankers provided the framework for credit excesses (see deregulation Greenspan era), because the banks lobbied for it because they wanted to grow. Naturally and in absence of a gold standard this became unsustainable and led into popping bubbles. Later accountability was abolished (bailouts) and endless liquidity is provided (QE) in order to delay the inevitable. This can't simply end well by itself, it just keeps the status quo as long as possible. Today debt levels are unsustainable all over the world.  After WW2 private debt was at a historic lows, so there was enough room for credit growth. The only way out is to reduce the debt drastically, but this can be achieved by drastic measures only: forced debt reliefs, financial repression, hyperinflation or winning a war or all of the above.

"Clear for cash" means also, reserves are exchanged. Banks keep reserves with the central bank which are mostly held in government bonds, which can be used as collateral to borrow cash from the central bank. This is how they clear for cash. 


It's not a meaningless technicality. You have to pay the cost for that outdated, inefficient system. Maybe not directly, but indirectly over interest rates, inflation, taxes aso.  Somehow this system has to be funded and it is barely possible from zero fee checking accounts.


As long the demand for cash does not exceed the available cash in the system. 


I never claimed that. As you correctly stated,  the bank liabilities (your money in the bank) is not backed by physical notes, but "clearing for cash" means either exchange physical notes or exchange of reserves, which are redeemable for cash. Banks give a shit each other about anything else.

SHA-2 was developed by the NSA in 2001, but a patent application was never filed by the United States. I believe there is a 12 month window starting from publication in which you can apply for a patent, so I think no one can claim it any more.
Digital circuitries like sha256 are designed by using standard cell library elements (mostly flip-flops, logic gates), which are abstractions and independent of the semiconductor manufacturing process (e.g 40nm, 16nm). A standard cell library element itself may contain patented technology and therefore ASIC manufacturers may have to pay royalties for using those cells, but this applies to any digital design, it is not specific to sha256.
Specific sha256 implementation improvements like ASICboost can be patented as well, but they do not prevent miners from using plain sha256. For a miner it is just an economic decision: do the cost savings justify the more expensive ASICboost chips?

No, it's unlimited supply with no enforceable  inflation rule. Any bank can mine dollarcoins as long as they think it's good for them. The devs can only try to influence reward points, but it doesn't stop the users to apply negative reward points. To make it worse, banks have to destroy old dollarcoins which they had created before. Since people are hodling dollarcoins banks have to mine always more than they destroy. Essentially it is a positive feedback loop, but when mining cost are too high banks won't mine enough dollarcoins and the system collapses. Then the devs have to intervene and increase supply artificially.

Before you bet the farm, get hands on experience. 
1) Electrum
2) Coinbase, Gemini
1) can be set up very quickly on any PC
2) Might take some time due to verification (KYC/AML)
When you done with 2) buy some tiny amounts and transfer it to your 1) wallet. Then buy something for bitcoin in order to get familiar with things. Also transfer something back to the exchange and sell. Learning by doing answers most of your questions and you don't risk your life savings.

Must still be valid transactions in block 2, otherwise the node will reject the block. The attacker can't manipulate transactions, since he has not the private keys for generating valid tx. He can only censor tx, but other nodes will add those tx anyway.

Very bad research by the author. He claims the SEC banned an index fund based on Bitcoin, both, Bitcoin and Onecoin are digital and crypto currencies without mentioning any difference. Then he claims Onecoin is an alternative to Bitcoin and investors switched from Bitcoin to Onecoin because of the scaling debate. He reports on the actions of the German financial authority 'Bafin' against Onecoin but connects this to the "warning" of the German Bundesbank against Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-05-16 16:30:39
The only security concern I see is that ASICboost makes the 51% attack a 45% attack, if the attacker used such chips and the other miners have no access to it. But this scenario is unlikely.
I don't get this "centralization" argument. There is so many things centralized in ASIC design and manufacturing. Bitcoin is so heavily dependent on a few commercial manufacturers. If they started to boycott hashing ASICs, Bitcoin is gone too. And what about EDA software? It's all commercial, lots of patent royalties are paid to those providers when designing an ASIC. And it's heavily centralized too, designers are dependent on TWO commercial software suppliers solely. Why there is no open source EDA software?

I don't understand this. OK, It will cost miners 20% more electricity using conventional ASICs in order to have the same hashrate compared to a mine with ASICboost chips. On the other hand the patent is not for free, the electricity savings will just be eaten up by royalty payments. If the patent holder is smart and want to make money, the advantage will be much smaller.

Electronic fiat money is just a promise. A promise can be transferred quickly no doubt.

Because you do not understand economics obviously. You essentially say that any transaction fees have no economic impact, since the merchant does charge the same price regardless of the transaction cost. For a single sale/item that might be true, but for the whole system it is not. If all customers paid with credit card only, he had to raise prices in general. Vice versa, if the system gets a more efficient payment system (less fees) he will reduce prices, because he has competitors. No one would argue that reducing the end user cost of a product without changing its quality and quantity is not  beneficial for the economy.

It's a myth that tulips were traded during the mania, but future contracts on tulip bulbs. People were not familiar with this new financial product and then it was unregulated.

The banking system in Amsterdam was quite advanced for the time and due to those inflows extremely liquid. It was actually a future-mania driven by liquidity, they could have taken almost anything under contract. But it happened to be tulips which had no other utility than decorating a front yard.

Essentially this is a DoS attack and the decentralized nature of Bitcoin can deal way better with that than a centralized system. Nodes including mining ones will discard invalid tx and disconnect from peers  (blacklist after a certain threshold), which send invalid tx, but this does not prevent an attacker sending IP packets to a certain IP/port. Like in any DoS attack scenario the problem is more the reduced usable bandwidth, especially when block size is increased but nodes do not increase their physical bandwidth at the same time.

That what they are claiming. For base money that is true indeed.


Yes, but he treasury notes are taken out of the economy at the same time. It's  a zero sum game.


Banks do not create loans out of base money, but out of collateral. If the privates have no assets to give as collateral or there simply is no demand for loans, banks can't create loans, no matter how much base money is in circulation relative to the money supply.


Again, treasury notes (=quasi money) is taken out of the market at the same time.
@_date: 2016-05-10 15:44:16


Only, if they provide own capital, what they have to do anyway in part for collateralized loans (reserve ratio). 


It is because the asset valuation (collateral) is fluctuating (market value). If all houses lose 50% of their market value and the bank is heavy in home loans like it was the situation during the housing crash for many banks, it will go bankrupt unless they find fresh capital or the government bails them out, e.g. changes the balancing rules = abolishing mark to market (what they did). That's why banks are actually so vulnerable against price crashes of their collateral and require proper assessment of collateral when giving a home loan. If these balancing rules were not in place, as you stated, they would not care about market values and would be immune against a house price crash. But that was not the case, as empirical evidence proves.

Which involves counterparty risks and leads to shady practices at Wall St. Per instance naked short selling is such a practice, where you sell shares, you never have (Byrne/Overstock wrote books about that). The reason is, that actual delivery takes too long so you can take a shortcuts per regulation here ... and of course it opens the door for legal abuses.

What is the problem with that? If that happens miners will pay less for electricity and more for royalties - it does not make a difference for Bitcoin. 
In addition royalties will boost technological advances and competition, since they are an incentive to improve efficiency (same security level with less energy). It can be only good for Bitcoin.

Any transaction increases the size of the blockchain, but pays for the cost by fees, no matter if it is spendable or not, no matter what purpose it is used for. In addition, the transaction value is irrelevant, since it has no impact on cost. Miners decide solely based on technical (rules)  and economic reasons (fees), which transaction they include and the Bitcoin protocol was never meant to censor transactions. 
Transactions are a feature, which will remain forever in the Bitcoin protocol, all other features like OP_RETURN are subject to modification, removal aso. Also OP_RETURN outputs might be pruned by nodes while transactions with unspent outputs can't. Latter have ultimate accessibility.

A [short] history of UK banks' system failures 
9 June 2012
The worst banking meltdown to date hit millions of customers of RBS, NatWest and Ulster Bank, locking them out of their accounts for days, and in the case of Ulster Bank customers, for weeks.
The meltdown hit not only customers of the three brands owned by RBS Group, but also people who were expecting salary payments from businesses that held accounts with the bank and other transfers between banks. RBS was later fined £50m by regulators, but the episode is understood to have cost the bank more than £100m.

Also, money doesn't shift at all, it just changes hands, because for every buyer there is a seller. When someone buys BTC for  $50k, somebody else sells for $50k, so money doesn't move in or out of BTC. The same is true for gold or any other asset.

*The Monetary Mechanism of Stateless Somalia by William J. Luther,  Kenyon College*
*A peculiar monetary institution emerged during the period of interregnum in Somalia from January 1991 to August 2012. Without a functioning government to restrict the supply of notes in circulation, Somalis found it profitable to contract with foreign printers and import forgeries. The exchange value of the largest denomination Somali shillings note fell from US $0.30 in 1991 to US $0.03 in 2008. However, the purchasing power eventually stabilized at the cost of producing additional notes.*

There is no such thing as Target2 money. Target2 allows the e.g. Deutsche Bundesbank to print the money it is paying out to its member banks while it has a claim against the e.g. Bank of Greece at the same time. It's cleared for the banks, yes, but still not cleared in the system. In a next step the Bank of Greece has to deliver the assets to the Deutsche Bundesbank. Target2 just allows to postpone this clearing indefinitely (which is actually an abuse of the Target2 system). The risk that the Bank of Greece can't pay it's obligations to the Deutsche Bundesbank persists, because they ran out of assets. The risk alone induces turbulences in the capital markets, which involves costs for the system as a whole (e.g. tax funded bail outs, haircuts, inflation). If the national central banks cleared immediately, it would reduce the cost of the system, but the clearing (exchange of assets between the central banks) is still required.

Please educate yourself on the basics of our monetary and banking system. Target2 is just an implementation within, nothing revolutionary. 
It is called BALANCE sheet for a reason. Even a central bank can't have more liabilities than assets or vice versa. In the end these imbalances have to be settled by exchange of reserves between central banks from time to time. That is true for the Euro System as well as the Dollar or all other fiat money. Imbalances happen due to money flows between the e.g. Chicago Fed and the e.g. St Louis Fed too. These imbalances need to be settled by the exchange of reserves between the Federal Reserve banks, otherwise the Dollars could become really different over time. You can't just short cut this system by installing a "settlement" system on the bank level. The settlement between central banks is still required and this outdated system causes cost which is by no way competitive to a virtual asset transfer system like Bitcoin. 
If all that would not be required, you could just install automated printing presses and shredders in every bank branch, connect them over the internet and by the push of the button Dollars, Euros or Yen are shredded on one end of world while on the other end fresh Dollars, Euros or Yen come out. But it doesn't work that way, because fiat money is backed by assets and they need to be exchanged.

Especially when it involves mostly uncollateralized loans, as it is the case with interbank loans. That's exactly the point I wanted to make. No matter what kind of ledger is used, as long as recorded transactions are based on trust, the whole system becomes a trusted system. 
That's why blockchain would be just an IT-upgrade for banks, not a qualitative improvement of our banking system. Blockchain might improve their efficiency a bit, but it won't cut the cost burden of  a trusted system (any trust/risk involves cost, e.g. insurance cost, cost to do constant risk analysis aso.).

Central banks have been doing it for many years now, but QE is not actual money printing. It is just exchanging bonds for cash which doesn't change anything significantly. Real printing money and just distributing cash into the economy without the requirement to pay it back, e.g. as government expenditures, is illegal.

Governments want to be able to control their monetary system (monetary sovereignty), so it would be a national solution only (monopoly to create tokens).

In theory, yes, but there is a catch: you have to keep the deposits in the bank otherwise it goes belly and takes the customers' money with it up (deposits go poof since they were created out of thin air). Bitcoin provides the utilities banks have provided so far (secure storage, transfer). There is also no necessity to get reimbursed for currency devaluation through interest payments. Fractional reserve with Bitcoin won't be possible like with fiat, maybe only a very small scale only. This topic has been discussed over and over again here.

Modern ASICs are designed on an abstraction level (RTL = register transfer level) in VHDL or Verilog. This is completely independent on the underlaying technology. Like you can compile C code on different libraries you can compile VHDL/Verilog code on different technology libraries (fab specific, nm specific aso.). A transition from 28 nm to 16 nm is mainly recompiling the source code, but that is not as simple as in software. The process is much more complicated, requires extensive, time consuming verification on different levels and involves re-iterations (possibly minor changes of source code for optimization). In addition this process requires extremely expensive commercial software. The competition is tight and you can't give up even a tiny advantage (by publishing the source code), otherwise you are out. 
Open Source developers are free to publish their designs (which they already do, e.g.,  it would leverage the industry a lot. The problem is the motivation, since you can only simulate the design on your computer, but not use it.

XT tried it, Classic tried it, both failed. It comes with quite some cost and effort. And you still have thousands of Core nodes, wallets can follow. Wallets couldn't follow if there were only a few Core nodes. That's why having plenty of non-mining full-nodes is economic power too.


No, they follow the rules. Some light wallets might not, but many users will be aware of that and prefer a wallet which follows the rules.


Wrong, they don't "actively reject blocks from miners they don't like", they just follow the rules and nodes will reject invalid blocks, no matter who mines them. 
If the economic majority ignores a hard fork, it will fail, because those tokes will have little value. Then miners will go broke, even if they have the majority hash power. It's a very risky gamble for them.


I didn't make that argument, but the claim that non-mining nodes were waste or useless is very uneducated.

In reality there have been bank runs: 
The Federal Reserve doesn't prevent bank runs, it just allows a bank to borrow cash against collateral in order to prevent a bank failure due to a bank run. But if a bank runs out of collateral, it can't borrow cash. A bank run can happen at any time if depositors lose trust in the bank. Commercial banking is a shell game, because a bank has reserves for a fraction of their liabilities only. Therefore a fraction of deposits can be paid out only on a first come first serve basis, no matter if there is a central bank or not.

Banks have no interest in Bitcoin. Their businesses model is to create credit out of collateral, and make money on the interest margin between loans and deposits. The higher they leverage their own capital, the more money they can make. It works only, because we have a fractional reserve system, which in turn works only because banks have a defacto money transmission monopoly and the system creates constant inflation (required for keeping a majority of deposits with banks). With Bitcoin these features are not available and their business model becomes obsolete. Bitcoin and commercial banking is just incompatible or it would be trying to pull automobiles instead of wagons with horses. With automobiles you don't need horses and coachmen, you can drive yourselves.

All government contracts (e.g. treasury notes) are payable in US Dollars, not in claims against private institutions. The banks' reserves are invested in Treasury notes and used as collateral with the Federal Reserve. If they could be paid off in e.g. Tether, which is a claim against an foreign private institution, it would put the monetary system upside down. It is not as simple and done with one tax rule change, because the consequences would be tremendous.

History doesn't end in 1913. Still, bad economic crisis happen under the Fed mandate. A central bank can manipulate a free market and postpone the inevitable and thus just making it worse. It even helps to create giant bubbles, and giant crashes as consequence. **The claim that the FED creates constant growth is simply retarded.**  
The point is that short cycles weed out bad economic actors and malinvestments more quickly, before bubbles can crash the economy severely. Free markets also enforces accountability - one of the foundations of capitalism, because bad economic actors are not bailed out by a government or central banks. Maybe the overall economic growth in a free market is not as big, but it would be for the better for the reasons I pointed out earlier.

You are correct, but commercial banks create credit (=IOUs on non-existent money which become their liabilities) out of collateral. They do not create money (notes and reserves with the central bank = only this is money, everything else is balances). You can verify that in the statistics of the Federal Reserve: outstanding loan amounts is a multiple of money in existence. Also, interest is not the hinging problem of this system, since interest is paid out to the public as income. There is always enough money to pay back all loans plus interest, but the problem is that the income is not evenly distributed. There are economic subjects with a surplus and other with a deficit, this is the problem.

No, commercial banks do not create US Dollars, they create claims on non-existent US Dollars when they create credit. There are no digital USD in existence - this is a myth - there are only balances/contractual claims on USD which are liabilities of banks and exceed the amount of USD in existence by a multiple of it. That's why it's called fractional reserve. Only the government is allowed to create US Dollars and only the Federal Reserve (with exception of coins) is allowed to bring them into circulation against acceptable collateral (mostly government bonds).

The point is that centralization enables control and abuse. Central banks have a long track record of doing that.

Right, USDC is just a digital IOU against Circle Internet Financial, Inc. You have to trust them and their auditor. The auditor doesn't even reveal which type of bank the funds are in. 
 
If was a commercial bank which runs fractional reserve, the USDC would become a claim against a bank denoted in US-Dollars and not backed by actual US-Dollars in the full amount. If that bank failed, then the USDC would be gone. Is there insurance? Do they use a different type of bank? There should be more transparency on that.

Get a checking and a brokerage account with the same bank. There is no cost to transfer money between them and it works instantly. Put your cash into a gold ETF or any other safe asset. If the bank goes belly up, it won't impact your ETF holdings in your brokerage account. I know, it's not as safe as owning physical gold, but way better than having funds uninsured which can be wiped out. Bank deposits are nothing else than a loan to the bank without getting any collateral for your loan.

"central banks’ reserves are already held as digital currencies"
This is nonsense. There is no digital Dollar, Yen, Euro or whatever in existence. No law or central bank statute defines a digital currency. In the Dollar Federal Reserve notes and government issued coins are currency only. Everything else is balances. When a bank exchanges Dollars with another bank their collateral (mostly government bonds) held with the central bank are exchanged. The Federal Reserve moves some Treasury notes from one pile to another and reflecting that on the balance sheets. That they do that bookkeeping, which has been done for over 100 years, on computers nowadays, does not make it a digital currency. Also this solution works only on a national or common fiat currency level, but not internationally. Foreign banks have no account with the Federal Reserve, they cannot not use this collateral exchange scheme. 
"In other words, the fractional-reserve banking system would be replaced by a narrow-banking system administered mostly by the central bank. That would amount to a financial revolution – and one that would yield many benefits. Central banks would be in a much better position to control credit bubbles, stop bank runs, prevent maturity mismatches, and regulate risky credit/lending decisions by private banks."
In other words, Roubini envisions that capitalism will be replaced by a despotic monetary system, which controls the whole economy through central bank controlled funding of economic activities. And then he thinks people would consider Bitcoin worthless and go all in on national digital central bank money created out of thin air. He calls it a revolution, but it is a step back, something that happened many times in history already and failed miserably all the time. Finally, Roubini reveals that he is a central planning charlatan without any understanding of economics. I can't believe that, I guess it is more desperation. 
Bitcoin is the real revolution and it can't be stopped.

A US Dollar is not a claim against a private institution. Commercial banks do not create US Dollars, they create claims on mainly non-existing US Dollars. Only the treasury can create US Dollars and only the Federal Reserve can bring them into circulation. When you pull the numbers from the Federal Reserve statistics, you see that the claims on US Dollars are a multiple of actual US Dollars in existence. That's why it is fractional reserve. If banks could create US Dollars, we would be in a full reserve system, but this is not the case. A claim against something is not the same as the thing which is claimed.

It is impossible to replace coal power by geothermal power from Iceland or hydropower from remote locations (e.g. in China), because transportation of electricity to coal power consumers is impossible or cost prohibitive. Miners can easily co-locate to such remote regions, where little other consumers compete for electricity. Industrial users need proximity to suppliers, workforce, consumers, infrastructure aso, that's why they can't co-locate easily. In contrast, Bitcoin mining can even fund renewable energy if utilities invest profits from electricity sale into generation and transportation capacity.

That the government prints money outright, is also considered good for the economy, at least some leading politicans and economists think so. It is good for the economy at least in the short term.

We all know this but what has this theoretical assumption to do with actual facts? As long as the cost to mine gold is below the market price, there will be always incentives to produce it. Especially if miners can avoid environmental regulation and exploit cheap labor it will always happen and that multiplies the environmental impact of energy use.

Here we have it:


**expanding the amount of bank deposits.** != creating money
A bank deposit is just a number in a bank's book or computer, not money. Proof: You can't pay your taxes with that number, even electronically. In the end your bank needs cash or reserves to be exchanged over the Federal Reserve. If the bank has nothing left for clearing meaning it is running out of reserves, your taxes are unpaid.


True, but broad money is a vague term, it includes money supply, e.g M2-M0, but a checking deposit or a CD is not money by law. It is a liability of a private bank. 
M0 consist of cash and for cash redeemable reserves of a commercial bank with the central bank. Customer deposits are not reserves. If banks redeem their reserves, the Treasury must print them and the Federal Reserve brings them into circulation.

LOL, isn't printing money just another form of bankruptcy?
Germany had a giant debt load (war reparations) after WWI, so they printed money and fucked their creditors. There is a long history of abuse of money printing by governments. The early Chinese empires used this trick.
A private debtor can't print money, so he has to go to court and file for bankruptcy. A government can just fire up the printing press. In both cases the assets of the creditors become more or less worthless.

Money already created is more or less meaningless for the economy, but velocity takes money into account, which was created as loan e.g. 10 years ago and now sitting on an account as deposit. Therefore velocity is  meaningless statistics, although most economic theories still think it is meaningful.


When banks creating credit, they have to create it out of collateral. The credit becomes a liability for the bank (demand deposit for the debtor), while the collateral (e.g. home title) the asset. Both needs to be balanced on the bank's asset sheet according to regulation. If it's not balanced, authorities can close the bank, because it is against regulation.

... which means a debt repayment obligation is created, so the money gets destroyed over time again, since those bonds are central bank holdings and the owners of a bond have to be paid. QE provides liquidity but does not add money to the system = net money aka helicopter money (money which has no repayment obligation ever). In result it does not give relief from the deflationary pressures (debtors are chasing money for repayment in order to get it destroyed by the bank) and high inflation will never arrive as has been observed in Japan over the last 20 years. The problem is caused by the unwinding process of an over-leveraged economy. The privates have taken out too much debt and following generations struggle to increase (because savings increases are not available for repayment) it constantly. Essentially it is a chain mail system or a positive feed back loop which can't stall otherwise it collapses. QE is just an artificial continuation of that process by governments and central banks in order to delay a collapse. It is artificial, because governments do not commerce, they are just spending. It does not heal the fundamental problem (too much debt caused by absence of a limiter for money creation, e.g. gold standard or tight regulation) and deflationary pressures will continue. The only "consequent" solution will be real money printing in order to bring the monetary system to ground zero and start over again - as it happend in history all the time.

Commercial banks are part of the overall process in a way that they have to buy treasuries themselves in order to make their business more profitable. Part of their profits (e.g. from interest payments, which are cash inflows) have to be used to increase their reserves (mandated by the reserve requirement). Instead of having it laying around as cash it will be converted into interest bearing bonds which are accepted as collateral by the Federal Reserve. In return the Federal Reserve can issue new cash against this collateral. In contrast, when banks create credit out of collateral (e.g. makes a home loan), it increases the deposits = liabilities of banks in the books only without creating a single US Dollar.
@_date: 2017-06-01 17:15:17
His essay is based on a misconception and it starts here:
"The mortgage servicer and the credit card banks receive your dollars as planned. But like you, they are having to start transacting more business in cryptocurrency as the world marches toward the brave new world, and so the dollars they are being paid by you to settle your debts with them are becoming less and less powerful in terms of how much cryptocurrency those dollars can buy. In real buying power terms, the banks you owe money to start losing buying power when they have to translate dollars they are paid into cryptocurrency, and that is causing the banks to suffer loses to its overall earnings.
When banks start losing money ..."
First, commercial banks do not lend their money or the money of others. Essentially they create credit out of collateral. When a loan is paid back, banks destroy the credit again. So banks do not care, what the currency is worth, because they do not keep the money. Secondly, the business model of commercial banks is making money by the interest rate spread, they do not make money by investing in assets. E.g. when a bank creates a mortgage for 4%  the money becomes the deposit of the seller of the house, which is bought with the mortgage of the buyer. But banks won't pay more interest than they charge, so they make money on the interest rate spread. Of course, there is a term structure risk for a bank, because a 30 year mortgage at 4% can be problematic when interest rates are rising and customers demand higher rates for their deposits. It is essentially a scenario of inflation when cryptocurrencies rise in value and become a notable part of the economy. But this is not new and banks have dealt with that problem for centuries. Of course, the bank's own capital will be at risk of devaluation in real terms, but they do not keep it in a vault, but invest it mainly in treasuries. When inflation rates pick up so will interest rates for treasuries. Therefore it is not a real problem for a bank. To the contrary, banks suffer from fiat deflation generally, because in such a scenario it is harder to pay back loans and there will be more defaults, which will eat the banks own capital away.  
To the contrary, banks will not lose money,  but they will make more money, when cryptocurrencies rise in value. The only thing what will happen is, that banks will create loans with cryptocurrencies as collateral. So the more the cryptocurrencies rise in value, the more loans they can make. In general, when investors buying assets with cash, not much happens (because money just changes hands, but it does not increase the money supply), but when banks start leveraging that cash recklessly any asset will get into a bubble of gigantic proportions (because it inflates the money supply). We have seen that in all previous bubbles, latest during the housing bubble when banks threw loans at almost everyone.  
The banks' business model won't work with cryptocurrencies, because they are like cash and can't be created out of "thin air" by a bank, because majority of users will and can keep it in their wallets and do not need the convenience (transfers) and economic purpose (interest) of a bank account.

A centrally controlled world currency can only work if there is a central world government doing the majority of government spending, since we have debt based money.

Then the taxpayers of governments acting economically will pay the bill for the governments acting irresponsibly. We have seen that in the EU with Greece.

You are twisting the facts. 


1) The chart says clearly "Global deaths in conflicts since the year 1400" and "military + civilian death rate [data from conflict catalog]". It's not an arbitrary past, it's continuous data from 1400 through today. The long term trend is clearly up as even a blind man could see. If the mortality rate rises, how come to the conclusion "the world is actually more safe today"? It might be true after the WW2 compared to the past, but this is a very short sighted conclusion, since modern banking has been in existence since about the 1400s.


2) "Homicides refer to interpersonal violence. Civilian and military deaths during interstate wars, civil wars and genocides are not counted as homicides" [from the article you linked], so it has nothing to do with the OP statement.

Why, when it gets worth less and less (fiat inflation)? I doubt it. People will invest into assets, but old wisdom says, for every buyer there is a seller, so money will just change hands. Inflation will bring interest rates up, so people have an incentive to keep it in the bank.


As explained, banks don't care about inflation, because they make money on the difference between loan interest rate and savings interest rate and they can pretty much control this spread. In addition high inflation leads to a loan surge, so they can compensate the devalued rate income with higher revenue.

It's a synthentic product and they are just trying to track the price of Bitcoin. It's actually a quite complex counterparty risk structure, since they keep the funds in different marketplaces, so their counterparty risks add as well. From the prospectus:
*The Certificates are non-equity linked certificates  which  synthetically track the performance of the price of Bitcoin in USD less  a  fee component.*
 *The Certificates will provide a synthetic underlying exposure to the value of Bitcoin.*
*The  Issuer  uses  different  marketplaces  for  Bitcoin  in  order  to  hedge  market  risks.  The Issuer must therefore keep liquid assets in certain marketplaces. Consequently, the Issuer is exposed to the risk that any of its counterparties does not fulfil their obligations, which  could have an adverse effect on the Issuer's business and its financial position if the risk occurs.*
If they really kept BTC in a vault, they could call it an ETF. But it is an ETN, a significant difference.
*However, unlike ETFs, ETNs do not buy or hold assets to replicate or approximate the performance of the underlying index. Investors are simply buying a promise to pay a market return by the issuer of the note if it is held to maturity.*

FDIC doesn't prevent bank runs, since they can cover only a small fraction of deposits. *The FDIC said its insured deposits reached $7.4 trillion as of the end of September, meaning that its Deposit Insurance Fund has about $100.2 billion* or *1.36% of all the FDIC-insured deposits in the U.S. banking system*. The amount of money with zero maturity (money which can be withdrawn at any time) is even at $15.8 trillion.

There are tools for formally verifying source code available already. PSL is a language for defining properties, which is then used by these tools to formally verifying the source code. This has been mostly used in chip design, since verification through behavioral analysis (simulation) is very time consuming and design fixes are costly and time consuming as well. Another benefit is that with simulation test coverage is always below 100% and cost increases exponentially with coverage. Formal tools achieve 100% coverage based on formal specification. Of course, this approach does not work without proper formal specification concurrent to the implementation. I think, in future there is no way around it for cryptocurrency software.

Notes were backed by gold (essentially they were gold certificates), but banks could issue more notes than they actually had gold in the vault because regulation was non-existent, vague or even allowed this. The problem was lacking transparency, people had to trust other people with economic power which led to abuse by bad actors. Governments were bad actors too, they issued paper notes backed by very little. Lincoln issued the so called Greenbacks in order to fund the Civil War. They were denoted in Dollars, but the Dollar was originally a unit of measurement for gold and silver by United States law (Coinage Acts).

Their reserves with the central bank are exchanged. This is either cash or for cash redeemable reserves. 
Cash or physical Dollars is part of their reserves. 
@_date: 2018-12-29 21:17:19
Check: 
Only the government is allowed to create US Dollars by law. No other institutions can create US Dollars. 
Only the Federal Reserve brings them into circulation against collateral. Check Federal Reserve Act. 
Public cannot use other Dollars than physical Dollars. There are no virtual Dollars in existence. What you probably mean is reserves of the banks held with the Federal Reserve, but these reserves are not in the economy. Only if a bank borrows Dollars from the Federal Reserve by using their reserves as collateral and pays them out to the public, they get into the economy. Everything else is balances. If a bank creates a loan, it creates a deposit denoted in Dollars, but not actual US Dollars. Otherwise the cash and reserves of the banks would be always equal to the created loans = full reserve system. But it is not a full reserve system, bank loans are a multiple of  cash and reserves of the banks. Check out the Federal Reserve statistics.

The BTC for the fund is bought up at market price or probably even below (OTC). The stock exchange price reflects only the shares which can be traded, not the fund inflows.
