This is simply too complex for me to grasp.  I don't see a value in it or understand how it makes any improvement for me. 
I'm not really interested in installing and constantly running anything on any device at all. 
Things like this should run in the background invisibly with no additional effort or use of additional resources. Otherwise I'm never going to do it.
I also want to drive a car, not work on cars. 
I want to live in a house, not build it. 
I want to play video games, not build a computer. 
You get my point. 
I just want to hold and spend and trade crypto safely and simply. Nothing more. 
If there is something I'm missing, please inform me further.

Sorry. My comment is more confusion than insight.  I don't rightly know. I just write it all down in a ledger and move on.

Why are they called seeds?  Seeds don't open anything. 
Passwords and keys do.

I'd like to see a week back. Does it dramatically increase?
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:37:53
Nah. This'll pass. This just shakes out the doubters and haters and schemers.

Rarity is one of the basic elements of this currency. It's actually designed to be harder to counterfeit the more you try. (See white paper)
If you think of a way to "easily copy" BTC, I'm all ears. 
Sounds like you need to read up before you try and disqualify BTC further.
@_date: 2017-12-06 08:27:37
Awe. You just missed it. It dropped to 9,250 for 35 seconds. It's back at 12,500 again.

How embarrassing for BCH Coin. Exposed!!
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:46:47
Look at last Sunday. That's happening again now. It's nothing. This is so far from the top still. We will be at 19.5k by 11 pm (pac time) 
I was happy with reaching 15k by Christmas. We are playing in the frosting of all this cake. 
Futures was just opened to a market 55x larger than last week. They know betting against BTC is disaster. This will only open the market up more. More interest and more investors. 
Relax and do nothing.

Bit Defender. Works like a champ. 
I have had no issues and I get messages from them reminding me that I'm safe even when things like global worms are spreading. 
I think you can get a year for 36 bucks and put it on 10 different devices, Mac, Windows, and mobile. I have it on every device in my house. 
Good luck. 
I'm sure someone will have beef with it for some odd reason or another, but I dig it.

Please refer to it as, "BCH coin". Thank you.

It was actually explained really well. Still sounded crazy as hell though.

He is a threat. Treatimg him as such makes sense. 
Does having an extinguisher in the kitchen mean you're obsessed with fire?

There are only 21 million BTC. Rarity.
They are only mined through work in time, effort investment in equipment and energy.
Eventually we will reach a time when they are nearly all mined. A limited supply of digital gold.
Then it will become transactional. What are you willing to trade and at what frequency?
Which will be aided by better hardware for commerce and security.

I'm plenty grown up and I saw fuckery today.
Perhaps you have more interest in not seeing it.

Try bitcointicker.us 
Doesn't actually access accoubts. Simply keeps a tally of your worth. 
Simple to set up. Like 3 seconds.
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:45:09
Well, I never expected more than 15k by the holidays. After all this drama today, BTC fell to 15.8k, and in less than 12 hrs, we are coming back to 17k. No one knows for sure, but I'm personally very confident. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:07:39
Oh come on. You know these two aren't mutually exclusive. Criticizing an exchange for their poor decisions doesn't equal mistrust of Bitcoin. 
Nor does it mean anyone is asking for government intervention.

This is how I feel the whales are working right now at the top of the market. 
  
@_date: 2018-05-23 19:02:57
 Hahaha. This is great. I dump 15,000 btc if it reaches 9k and then I buy it all back for 8k. Hahaha. I could do this forever! So fun. 
You dont want to miss what's just around the corner. Keep buying .000452 btc every month.
Dont worry, someday youll be rich and secure like me. This is a futuristic market where everyone can 
DUMP.    
Bwa hahahaha. I did it again.  Hodl on weak hands! Your weak hands are causing all this. Buy the dip. Tell your friends and family. 
@_date: 2018-05-23 16:13:06
How do they adjust for massive weekly dumps...er, I mean, "corrections"?
@_date: 2018-05-11 06:53:37
Would you trust that?

Nope. Disinterested. Distrustful.

Wth? "Just to steal from"?
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:55:26
Hey, why did your app use almost 4 gigs of data in the first week I used it?
Is this app mining in the background with my data and phone? 
Because that would be very uncool.
(Edit) Just checked wifi use. 43 gig in the last week!!!!!!!  
SOMETHING VERY WRONG HERE.
@_date: 2017-11-01 02:08:19
This question... Every single day. 
It's always a good time to buy. Period. Tell your friends. Sticky this forever. Bitcoin is always just fine to buy. 
No one knows the market or your financial status enough to tell you anything beyond that.
@_date: 2017-11-06 02:03:32
This sounds like money for free. Why would this be a thing?
If I didn't mine it or pay for it. Why would it have value?
Anyone with BTC double their holdings in one day?
I don't get it. I have about 6k in BTC. Right now my only plan is keeping it on my trezor and waiting until the smoke clears. Everything else feels scammy and incorrect somehow.
Can anyone clear this up?
@_date: 2017-11-06 04:42:54
Great. Thank you. That was short and informational.

Also trying to associate "Steal" with Tesla. 
Such desperately obvious haters. 
Shall we talk about the ”theft” of billions of oil and gas subsidies that tax payers are robbed of each year by these energy companies?

Read the instructions from any of the places you're mentioning, would be a great start.
