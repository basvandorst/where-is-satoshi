Agreed. Bitcoin is nothing more than a cult, not a currency.

Bitcoin will pop for good, it'll be one to remember. Humans are so fuckin funny.

I live by the saying, never make an investment based on emotion. All bitcoin seems to be is emotion, a quick take on this subreddit and it is easily confirmed. Words like "believe", phrases like "to the moon" etc.. get thrown around all too frequently. 
Sure there is a logical system behind it all, a fantastic idea even, but a vast majority of the high prices are attributed to the hoarding because it is simply the flavour of the day. That's all bitcoin is. It cannot last like this. It wont last. History repeats itself and it has all the hallmarks of a classic bubble. 
If you got in early, I'm actually totally jealous of you. If I had of however, I'd be out at @ $1000 before you could say "bitcoin" to make a quick buck before all the fun stops.  
That's my .2c.....or .00000002BTC rather. Until the next big thing....

Who said Bitcoin will be around in the long term? Investing is always a gamble.

Wonder if the OP buys gas, groceries and electricity and gass bills with Bitcoin.

Is bitcoin a new currency or a new religion? I'm confused here.
