You love to act as if you are an all-knowing guru here but you don't know shit about shit and are fucking annoying.
Your "question" can be easily refuted by anyone with half a brain.  
I'm not going to waste my time.

Douche bag.

Stopped reading at: 
"The list of ways that Bitcoin has proved useful to criminals keeps growing, from the ransom payments on locked-up computer files — or even hostages — to illegal drug sales."
What has the dollar and other govt. issued currencies been used for for decades.
I'm tired of this lazy journalism. hyperbole. etc.

Fuck Trump.

'Anonymity, "experts" say, is the only real advancement bitcoin has over other forms of payment. '
Who writes this shit?
@_date: 2019-04-23 10:32:46
He makes predictions then revises them then revises the revisions...
He's worthless just like everyone else who does bitcoin TA.
@_date: 2019-04-15 03:36:47


My apologies.  I missed that somehow.
@_date: 2019-04-22 10:19:44
No.  It's not idiot proof.
@_date: 2019-04-23 10:35:05
People smarter than you have already reviewed things.
Don't waste your time.
@_date: 2019-04-15 03:07:01
Meh.  This guy has been preaching this for years.
It won't happen.
@_date: 2019-04-08 07:19:58
Do you truly have any sense how fucking stupid people are?  Every single person thinks he/she is a genius.  Most can barely wipe their ass.
Now some douche decided to pump and dump bitcoin and everyone wants to post a rollercoaster gif or something like this.
@_date: 2019-04-08 06:55:43
Yay.  Good for him.  Some random dude In Slovenia I've never heard of made a fortune off bitcoin.
I don't care about your anecdotal stories.  Everyone here with less than a bitcoin thinks they are going to have a Lamborghini in 5 years.
It's insane.  You are being upvoted for being insane and me the opposite.

Tom Lee is worthless.

Hold on there, captain...  Is that not how banks make money?
The Forex is manipulated, gold is manipulated, etc.
Edit:  I definitely do not have the money a bank has, I'm embarrassed to say...
@_date: 2019-04-08 01:12:34
Actually, I bought in 2013 well before you.
Edit:  Nice username you fucking douchebag.
Were cryptosuperman and cryptohero taken?
What the actual fuck is wrong with people?
@_date: 2019-04-23 12:27:04
MEH.  Downvote away.  This sub is like YouTube now.
He shouldn't be posting here without contacting the main contributors directly at this point.  
If he was bright, he would have done so.  Ergo. he is rehashing things that have already been considered and dealt with.
@_date: 2019-04-15 04:10:18
No, it won't.
@_date: 2019-04-22 15:24:45
OK, dad...  
I don't care where you managed to stay for a whole entire complete less than 24 hours.
He's also has the best words and won bigly with his white trash base.
If you watched anything but FOX News you would know the entire world is laughing at him and us.
@_date: 2019-04-03 04:21:40
From time-to-time I see posts here associated with this person.  He needs to be taken into an alley and have the shit beaten out of him.  His face has surpassed punchable. 
@_date: 2019-04-07 06:09:20
I hate these worthless to the moon posts.  You will NEVER be rich as a result of bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-04-23 10:43:12
I'm not trying to be an ass.  That is a fact.
Contact the contributors directly (some of the brightest coders and mathematicians on the planet) with your question instead of posting it here.  This place is now filled with "mostly" the opposite audience you want to attract - unless they maybe PM you in the off chance they still watch this sub when not working their asses off.  At least that has been my observation over the past few years.
...but I'm sure you don't need to be told that because you're a genius.
I'll get you started: Scroll to the bottom of this wiki and contact one of the references:

Already posted.  April Fool's joke.
@_date: 2019-04-23 10:50:55
My review of you is that you are abrasive.  I feel that to be comprehensive enough.
@_date: 2019-04-22 15:26:52
Dude, you need to stop watching FOX News.  Seriously.
@_date: 2019-04-22 10:38:37
I'm guessing the douchebag suite...
That conman's approval rating has dropped to 37% even according to Drudge and there are still "geniuses" here who fall for his shit.
If Charles Manson were still alive and running as a Republican, you would worship him too.
@_date: 2019-04-19 08:16:29
He should already be in jail.
Sue me too you halfwit lying piece of shit.
