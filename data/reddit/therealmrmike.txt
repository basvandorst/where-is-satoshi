Its not recommended to leave your coins on Coinbase but with the chance of a hardfork I would definantly move them.

Lol I see you posted to R/gambling first which would have been more appropriate.  most bitcoin users are well familiar with gambling and bitcoin.  just saying.  Telling Noobs to buy from Coinbase and transfer directly to a gambling site is not a good idea.  Coinbase frowns upon that

I am in the same boat couple months in still have the 300 limit.
