Wrong. There is only 21million bitcoins period. You must be refering too the unlimited supply of different blockchains. Well its much like a start up business. Most will fail some will succeed.

The bank is only required too hold the 10%. The new money is created once the loan is made. This is why we are 21trillion dollar in debt amongst other reasons.

That same 100 bucks will be worth quite a bit later on. Bitcoin is here to stay and isn't going anywhere.
