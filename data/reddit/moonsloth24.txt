Like most people here the poster above you doesn't know anything about economics, so don't take his comments too seriously.

I'll sell you a jet plane for the low low price of 100 bit-coins, send them over and I'll tell you where to pick up your plane!
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:36:47


Is this somehow surprising?
@_date: 2017-11-05 15:04:00
Wow, rude
@_date: 2017-11-07 20:47:53
How about the users paying them?
@_date: 2017-11-10 11:32:42
*Or so they say!*
@_date: 2017-11-10 11:29:40
"groups of nodes" aka banks or maybe credit unions
@_date: 2017-11-01 11:39:04


That's nothing, wait until you learn how much Dutch guilders plummeted in relation to tulips in the 1600s!

This post also sums up the state of this sub. A shameless lie that is immediately disproven by taking a few seconds to check the claim.
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:39:18
I think he is, which also explains why he's using it as an insult.
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:13:52
We're talking about BTC here.
@_date: 2017-11-07 20:36:19
Is there some reason why paid coders cannot write open source software? Because they do, all the time.
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:48:41


I must say I'm a bit confused. Are you saying angry neckbeards will hound him?
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:51:18
Bbbut bitcoin is ~~anonymous~~ ~~pseudonymous~~ very hard to trace!
@_date: 2017-11-05 12:09:32
Geez, if you're a conspiracy nutter just buy some platinum bars and hide them under your birdbath.
@_date: 2017-11-14 09:46:28
So how does that work?
@_date: 2017-11-08 09:16:01


This is the new "God is on our side"
@_date: 2017-11-14 10:02:17
Your lying post up there. It's a lie. Also immediately disproven by reading the flyer. You're a bad poster.
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:50:53
A money processor is required by law to keep track of every transaction that goes through them, even is it's barter. Cryptos are not an exception.
@_date: 2017-11-15 11:19:17
We're so lucky thermos protects us from centralism.
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:20:45
Luckily bitcoin is unregulated so there's no danger of the manipulators ever getting punished.
@_date: 2017-11-07 10:29:25
So? Hire some new ones.
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:35:07
@_date: 2017-10-11 17:11:09
The constant lying isn't to push a narrative, it's just something that comes naturally to bitcoin aficionados.
@_date: 2017-10-30 10:37:03
Only 80k BTC left, plus presumably a lot of other cryptos? He must be crying all the way to the beyourownbank.
@_date: 2017-10-11 09:28:20
No, many rich countries' govts actually do that right now, provide essentially free medical care and education to the population.
@_date: 2017-10-14 08:22:00
And the response proves him right. The circle is complete.
@_date: 2017-10-19 10:39:39
I'm sure it makes a great deal of difference to the trigger-happy SWAT team.

It's simple, check the chain lengths daily and shuffle the ticker symbols around accordingly.
@_date: 2017-10-27 10:09:47


I thought it was the purpose of this subreddit???
@_date: 2017-10-22 10:26:27
@_date: 2017-10-29 18:45:01
That's a constant multiplier improvement, not a different complexity class, unless you argue that the average number of transactions per channel increases as the total number of transactions in the network increases. It might not be impossible but it's not given either.
@_date: 2017-10-16 17:16:32
It's not if bitcoin happens to crash.
@_date: 2017-10-12 11:10:36
That's called living in denial.
@_date: 2017-10-16 17:04:30
Spending is economically equivalent to selling.
@_date: 2017-10-20 22:47:00
You can't fake mining though, that's why it defines the real bitCoin.
@_date: 2017-10-31 11:11:52
The situation is not symmetric. Even a small deflation rate hurts lending to low-profit businesses.
@_date: 2017-10-11 16:43:50
As it should be, everything requires resources. Do you believe bitcoin-based wealth is created magically out of nothing?
@_date: 2017-10-16 17:14:58
Lol, grownups are so clueless about bitCoin!
@_date: 2017-10-11 18:30:49
Nothing magical about it, every penny of profit from bitcoin comes from the pocket of another "investor'", just like in regular pyramid schemes.
@_date: 2017-10-09 20:40:06
Nothing gets past this guy!
@_date: 2017-10-19 10:44:12
Autists assemble!
@_date: 2017-10-23 23:29:15
Don't forget the part where Bitfinex steals all your butts.
@_date: 2017-10-28 10:37:41
This is what dumb people believe, year after year, despite massive evidence to the contrary.
@_date: 2017-10-28 20:55:56
Lol you got thermos
@_date: 2017-10-09 20:50:45
Yes, that's what most governments in rich countries do.
@_date: 2017-10-31 22:08:27


Let's be honest here, it's not. Every competing technology is both cheaper and more convenient.
@_date: 2017-10-29 11:41:39
LN doesn't help with the scaling either, it's just another fixed multiplier, and the jury's still out if said multiplier is larger than 1 in practice.
@_date: 2017-10-28 21:09:42
No mostly just about how fleet-footed minorities are.
@_date: 2017-10-17 19:49:36
You don't show your age!
@_date: 2017-10-17 19:51:33
No? Only if you're buying bitcoins. Spending USD is equivalent to selling USD. Spending bitcoins is equivalent to selling bitcoins.
