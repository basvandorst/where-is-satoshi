Lykke is my fiat ramp. It's multisig too, so you own your coins in there (vs IOU's)

@_date: 2017-12-14 18:32:08
Even though it's not a technical problem, it allows those nodes to not use the ledger (or far less.. at their convenience really). This goes against everything btc is supposed to stand for. A node as we know it now won't be validating the network, you won't see your tx on the ledger, you can't (as a normal user) participate by pointing your gpu to a pool (well you can but won't be mining those transactions).
It removes the possibility for normal users to participate. Sure, they can setup a ln node but will be limited by the amount of btc he can poney up and the channels he can set up. 
With the exception of storing your own coins using private key, there is no more "be your own bank". And even that .. i'm sure ln nodes will offer that service, by means of smaller fees (as they don't have to have the tx mined)
Tldr : principle, ideology
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:27:31
All that is true but you are forgetting that nodes do no HAVE to write the transactions on the chain, only if they close the channel.
The coinbase &lt;&gt; bitfinex channel could stay open for years, sending coin back and forth and not once write it on the chain
(or so that's what i remember)

I'm be downvoted but will just come out and say it. Btc has and is in the progress of a hostile takeover.
I makes me really mad to be honest, thinking about what could have been.
It's come to a point where people are actually begging for offchain transactions and supernodes.
Who do you think these supernodes will be ?!
At least everything is evolving more into broad usage of blockchain and will still change the world for the better.
BTC is a collectors item in my eyes lately.

@_date: 2017-12-14 12:56:39
I guess I could have worded it more carefuly. I'll also look it up again to be sure.  I was also under the impression that onchain settlement isn't required anymore, until the node deems it necessary. 
I guess I don't like the principle of off chain settlement.
Regardless, hows the implementation of LN going then ?

The seed (words) you got are used to derive all private keys from it.
Meaning that if you have the words you are fine for all wallets.
If you don't have the words but acces to the wallets I would send all your coin to an exchange and then configure the ledger as a new device, this time backing up your seeds.
then send everything back
but i dno what u mean, not very clear you are.

Do you know how lightning network works ? The jist of it is that "paths" will be formed between the sender and the receiver whereby the transaction "hops" between nodes. These nodes must know the following node. So you spinning up a node is useless as you don't know enough other nodes.
Not to mention that these nodes must hold the amount of coin, at least, as the coin being sent (as collateral somehow).
This is extremely similar to the current financial system.
The problem, imho, is that this will obviously evolve into something where people with a A LOT of coin will grow to be "supernodes" as they'll "know" a lot of the other nodes AND have the means (coin) to be a supernode.
In contrast anybody could buy a miner or point their gfx card to a pool to mine bigger blocks. New pools can be created etc. It's way more accessible to secure the network than trying to become a supernode.

@_date: 2017-12-14 13:12:20
who said anything about secret ? 
I was saying that lightning nodes will need a lot of coin in order to be useful and only those with a lot of coin will become important nodes with many open channels. Not to mention that the node decides when to write the handled transactions to the blockchain.
This means it's technically possible for a node to serve transactions between of other nodes with which channels are and remains open, without even writing on the blockchain.

You'll have a hard time buying with fiat if you don't wanna kyc at all. Then ur best bet are localbitcoins (person 2 person) or mining whatever coin and trading it for btc. If ur good, you can then trade your way into riches. But you'll have to segment it all because when exchanges see big trades from non kyc, they might lock it.
Just use an exchange.. if we want crypto to survive we'll have to probably declare our holdings at some point in the future anyway.

* your words together can generate a private key
* your private key is the address of your wallet
* with an offline storage your address is ONLY on said offline storage
* an exchange wallet contains your seed (words) and address
that means if they get hacked for instance, the hacker can recreate your wallet anywhere and thus have access to your coins
Coins not meant for trading should be stored somewhere more trusted (this could be your phone or computer at home).

And about not being real .. show me my gold, where is it ? ..
@_date: 2017-08-04 09:11:03
I see your point, but


That is not true. Converions included, it is still cheaper to send 1K using btc than the conventional way. (you might be interested in ripple btw, their product will make conventional sending much cheaper, another use case of crypto).
That being said, (and i really do get your point), for me it's about ideology. Cash, where I live, is as good as outlawed over a few K. That kind of forces you towards banks. Banks which take the promise of your future money and do all kinds of things with it (evil conspiracies aside they at least leverage the shit out of it and invest to make themselves richer). When that fails they want our tax money to bail them out, as happened in countless countries. If we don't they will just take our money (as happened in cyprus). In the very best case they just want all kinds of fees for this and that, just to have your money there (and you HAVE to).
Assuming volatility indeed decreases, btc allows the little man to control his funds fully himself using a system he can verify himself all whilst having the same conveniences as keeping it in the bank.


There are actually a lot of companies offering debit/credit cards directly linked to a bitcoin account, allowing you to spend it anywhere. There are even upcoming cards which can link to YOUR (not "a") bitcoin wallet.
I believe this might lead to banks allowing btc in your account with them (assuming volatility decreases). It completely goes against all i've said but hey, why not. If this is the case at least you have the choice to also completely control it yourself.
Not to mention that this evolution isn't limited to bitcoin, but blockchain will change a lot of things in the long run (at least in the backend of things).
I guess you might call me naive, but this is the only chance i see for "the people" to challenge the power of the banks (and their shenanigans), which imho has proven itself to be the actual ponzi scheme of global proportions. And where's my gold.. this piece of paper says my gold is in your building, give it to me ! :p

@_date: 2017-08-04 08:14:05
This only applies for traders because as you can see this cycle is bound to repeat itself a number of times until  volatility is less hi gh
@_date: 2017-08-04 08:44:39
that's not the sole use of bitcoin.
The point of bitcoin is to have funds which you control 100% by means of private keys ("be your own bank"). Kind of like cash in a way except you can use it online. You could send a friend which lives on the other side of the world btc for a fraction of the time and costs of a regular international wire.
My answer was based on your question which contains the word INVESTMENT. An INVESTMENT is by definition buying something in the hope that it will gain value.
The reason it goes up and up lately is because we are very early. Once everybody that is interested will have bought their share, volatility will be much lower and at that point btc will just be currency.
Bitcoin is also significant because it "invented" (could be others dno) blockchain, which has a ton of use cases (such as notarization). It removes the (centralized) middle man which in theory combats corruption and allows for trustless networks.

* are you really denying that blockstream employs the (now..) core developers ? I don't think i need to prove that .. 
* I'm not going to go through years of talk on bitcointalk to find prove of them being shunned. Simply reading how guys like Jeremy Allaire, Brian Armstrong, Eric Vorhees, Gavin Andreson and Vinny Lingham were treated for simply not having changed their mind, is enough. You know where to find that info (bitcointalk) 
* Euhm, the agreements (ny,hongkong) were rather clear about the terms for segwit and the 2block. What happened in the end ? Segwit and no 2mb .. (that is what gave rise to the recent bch rise)


I have no proof, it's my own feeling. I've been into conspiracies for over 10 years, for fun. This whole thing is like conspiracy 101.
**Now, could YOU tell me why segwit is better than just using the blockchain ? If it's better, why are fees still so high and speeds so low ? It's only been what, 3 months since activation ?**
Cause that's the thing. In the end most people don't care about conspiracies, we care about USING bitcoin and today it's unusable. THAT is why Bitcoin Cash has been created. They are not the reason for this mess on btc itself, they luckely just offer a solution (which surprise surprise is as simple as sticking to the original plan).

That being said, given the recent increase it could be that the price drops in the coming weeks.
That hardly matters in the long run, just saying, don't freak out :p

Dollar cost averaging is difficult at these prices.
Started a year ago and stopped around 4K, expecting correction.
Won't be FOMO'ing in now, a correct is more than due (not to a lot of people cashing in for the holidays)

Hey Man,
so I looked at the video you've linked me and I appreciate the tech aspects of LN+SW. However, for me I guess it boils down to the question "Aren't we afraid that LN nodes will over time migrate into normal nodes (like us) but also supernodes which hold many open channels ?"
I ask this because it seems obvious that being a supernode will require a lot of coin. This would shift the importance of the chain and especially the fee system towards old skool coin holders (no problem) and institutions with enough moeny to be a supernode (banks and the like).
Nothing would stop them from just keeping the channels open for quite a while, completely voiding the point of using the decentralized ledger.
All that is required then is mandatory KYC and you end up with a system which reminds me very much of the current financial system; except they occasionally use the ledger when closing a channel.
Combining that with the other shenanigans doesn't inspire confidence.
That being said, even if a so-called take over is going on, that would mean btc is here to stay.
And I just my little btc as store of value so I'm not too bothered; im way deeper into alts.
sry for the tone of my previous posts btw

Mine don't even wanna run the wallets on their pc which is always idling because "it downloads too much" .. (they have like 50mpbs 'unlimited' internet ..)
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:01:36
Any actual wallet is basically the same, meaning you have one or more public keys (addresses) and one private key to access them.
you would only need to create the wallet once, and just keep sending coin to that address (be it from a paper wallet or a ledger)
I would suggest the ledger because you private key will never leave the hardware wallet, making it completely secure even on an infested computer
if you break or lose your ledger (or if ledger goes bankrupt) or WHATEVER happens, you can restore ALL of the wallets which the ledger holds using the key (24 words) you will be provided
while you wait for your ledger, you can always download the btc qt wallet and back-up the .wallet file provided (on top of this you can encrypt your wallet with an extra password). your private key can also be extracted from the wallet file.
Leavint the qt wallet open will also make you a node for the network (caution: you'll have to download 250 gb first)
tldr: if you have the private key (the words you'll be given) you have direct access to the blockchain, regardless of the wallet used

ok, thx
follow up question, do you know the status of the LN dev advancement ?
Seeing as SW isn't catching on and the blocksize won't be increased, we could really use LN yesterday.
@_date: 2017-11-22 17:32:35
yeah but that was at the very beginning.

Why don't you get a hardware wallet, serious question.
It's really the way to go considering the long term, fork friendly no doubt (especially the ledger nano s which i use)
@_date: 2017-09-19 09:58:02
Do you think they will do an ICO ? :p
@_date: 2017-09-19 11:23:54
Ow, I didn't even.. NICE .. thanks man !!
@_date: 2017-09-18 09:33:14
Some do, such as Lykke.
@_date: 2017-09-18 13:03:15
However, it being an exchange aside, on top of the multisignature account they also have private wallets. 
In both cases you get the seeds to your account.
Was just trying to help :)

The point of sale system should convert the price of the burger in $ (as set by the burger joint owner) into btc, based on the exchange rate at the moment of purchase.
Also i'm hungry now thx
@_date: 2017-10-12 20:13:00
Seconding this, I regret every single sale i've made (except stratis). Now i'm buying back all that stuff at steeper prices ..
I used to have several btc, SEVERAL I tell you!
@_date: 2017-10-17 14:48:31
That was an odd couple of things to do. Why didn't you just buy on say coinbase ?
@_date: 2017-09-18 21:09:22
Maybe other people know some apps, but I don't know any that give you true control over the private keys (and thus the chain).
You will always rely on the third party.
What you want are the computer programs/wallets that let you access the chain directly and some. Don't you have a spare/old computer (or even make a virtual machine) on which you install the wallets. With those you are golden.. forks, airdrops, noding, staking/harvesting, full erc-20 token support etc.
 None of those you can do with apps from some 3rd party, AFAIK.
@_date: 2017-10-10 10:14:10
So .. "this is good for bitcoin" ?

Change banks
I'm gonna do so too. Last friday the bank called because they saw (based on a wire) that i'm buying a house and were giving me shit about not consulting them.
Get your face out of my account omg!

Lol; happy holiday man ! :p
@_date: 2017-10-16 17:35:46
I buy every month, if only because I need BTC for the bulk of my alts. Then I just keep 10% or so for the ledger.
@_date: 2017-09-13 10:37:48
TA from a coinbase user.. riiight
@_date: 2017-09-18 08:03:37
I use lykke.
It's an exchange but their wallets are multisig.
The app is great and the debit card will come very soon.
I don't keep my hodlings in it but it's great for spending money.
@_date: 2017-10-14 00:45:23
Not heavily persé, just dollar cost averaging, buy regularly and consistently.
That being said, there are other blockchain projects out there that might yield more gains but they require more research and general management. They are also vastly more risky to invest in.
Careful too, before u know it you'll have 50 different coins :p
Good luck.
@_date: 2017-09-12 13:10:43
How exactly is it plunging ?

This for real ?
I would actually challenge you to find an exchange that charges more if buying coin with a CC.
@_date: 2017-10-12 20:48:28
It's hard work really. I bought stratis at 20 cents, looked great, performed great, such future wow.
But when REALLY looking into it.. i dno, i didn't like it.
That takes times and effort.. new coins all the time too! 
@_date: 2017-10-23 09:08:31
Lykke (non-US for now) has no fees. (but their spread is still rather high)
@_date: 2017-09-14 16:59:08
900$ , but didn't get many :(
@_date: 2017-10-24 11:23:54
Chances are it would be like G+, including google employees shilling it :p
@_date: 2017-10-18 17:53:56
How much did you send ? Over 1K, over 5 ? over 10 ?
@_date: 2017-10-24 10:36:22
Depends, if ur scared and bought lower, you could sell. If you didn't make money, just hodl (unless you NEED the money)
@_date: 2017-10-24 17:41:33
You are not assessing your risk very well considering you don't realize yet that most of those tokens aren't supposed to be currency.
@_date: 2017-10-11 18:07:42
This, not to mention that they surely have a lot of coin which they had the foresight of hodling, considering they've been making wallets for a while.
But their products are awesome, so they deserve it !
@_date: 2017-10-25 17:34:01
This why we consider ourselves early. This rapid and massive rise won't continue forever.
Ater each of these up-down cycles, the % of increase will decrease. At some point in the future it should behave like fiat currencies, in terms of value towards eachother.
I also think btc will become more of a store of value, like indeed gold. As for "internet money for the masses", I'm starting to think that they'll be able to use whatever they want; it will be exchanged on the fly during the transaction.
There will be a need for a default value to compare against tho, that might be bitcoin or even still fiat :o
edit: based on your "you folks" i would say.. Welcome to crypto ;)
@_date: 2017-10-16 08:35:56

So did you ever sell any or are you still working and hodling ?

@_date: 2017-06-15 10:37:56
Thx for your relatively objective answer.
I'm just a newb trying to figure it out.
I don't have the history you guys have, so up to now I summarized it to myself as "blocks are full, we need bigger blocks".
All that stuff that is going on.. BIP148,sw,swx2 etc is just a big mess and can only impact BTC whilest according to others hard forks to bigger blocks is all that's needed and is technically a lot cleaner and easier than the mess we have (not to mention hf's have been done).
I don't see why it's necessary, i don't see why patents should be envolved, I don't see why "divide and conquer" should be applied.
I may not understand it enough, but all we needed to do is follow the whitepaper and roll back the blocksize limit which was supposed to be temporary.
I guess my point is that all this smells real fishy.
@_date: 2017-06-26 20:49:00
Based on what does this man say that ?
@_date: 2017-06-15 11:19:07


I understand that this is a risk but considering the increase of bandwidth and the decrease in price / megabyte I think the risk is overstated.


I understand, but it's only contentious because of the whole SW drama. But seeing as it is as it is .. sure


I feel that this 2MB is bait, but that's me


I might be wrong and apologize
Anyway, this is how things go when they take off, the initial ideology can never be maintained (see the internet for instance). I just would have prefered to see a future without the likes of blockst. and their layered solutions.
So yeah, if this (imho) perverse implementation is what it will take to drag btc into the next chapter, so be it.
Talking about it ad nauseum has no point so i'll retreat back to and :p
Thx and see you at the BS gate, on the moon ;)
