There are instructions on their front page, install "bitcoin-release-1-6.noarch.rpm", which adds their repository in /etc/yum.repo.d and adds their GPG key to /etc/pki/rpm-gpg/, then you just yum install bitcoin or yum install bitcoin-server (for headless).
It might be worth doing this even now, so any updated RPMs will automagically get pulled the next time you do a yum update.

This is what I was thinking and was pretty confused.

Resolving dependences? Did you use the RPMs from ringingliberty? I've never had to manually resolve dependencies from their RPMS.

What does this have to do with bitcoin? 
@_date: 2015-01-01 00:12:45
Nope, this doesn't do any mining.
This article just explains how to run a Bitcoin Node which will distribute the blockchain out to other peers. But mining is a bit pointless now considering the difficulty.

Which part wasn't clear? :)


Yes, you needed to install the bitcoin-release RPM first manually (Run: yum localinstall  without it, you wouldn't find anything using yum search bitcoin as the stock Fedora repositories don't have Bitcoin in them yet.
Downloading it manually like you did works too, I was just saying it might be good to install bitcoin-release so next time you run yum update, you'll pull in the latest RPMs along with your usual Fedora updates.
@_date: 2015-01-01 00:01:28
Yup, you probably already installed bitcoin-server, but adding the repo is useful so updated RPMs are pulled in next time you run "yum update"
@_date: 2015-01-01 00:21:35
You can run Bitcoin to run on a different port, and forward that on your router.

Nothing really. I have looked at the SRPMs, and I was satisfied, but no, there is no real reason to "trust" their binaries.
I'm only running my full nodes as walletless nodes, on virtual machines dedicated to only running bitcoind so I'm not too fussed about it being compromised tbh.

Ah I didn't know this! Very interesting.

I've made no money in Bitcoin, not even holding anything atm, but I'm running three full nodes. :(
@_date: 2017-08-01 15:48:47
Here's a dumb one. What's the difference between a full node and a full archive node? I'm running two full nodes. First time I've heard the term "full archive node".
@_date: 2017-08-01 17:02:48
Ah right. I don't have pruning enabled either.

I'm using InfluxDB/Grafana for a number of things (nothing bitcoin related yet), but I cannot for the life of me make my dashboards look as pretty as everyone else manages to do. :(

Just out of curiosity, what is the procedure for preparing a binary tarball? I mean, other than compiling it, and testing that it works what goes on behind the scenes to say "yup, ready to be pushed out"?

The highest number of connections I've had on a single box is 142 connections.
Right now, I have a total of [413 current connections]( across 4 full node boxes I'm running, with a maximum of 500 across all 4 of boxes.
It's pretty satisfying to me too. I'm planning on setting up a couple more boxes soon. :)
