another case for hodling lol - if you don't send any bitcoin your public key is not public.

no, it is generated randomly during the setup.

coinbase to get started -it provides you with a built in wallet for Bitcoin, Ethereum and Litecoin.
It is one of the most trusted exchanges.
It has a decent app too.

-Mt. Gox was hacked and many ppl lost Bitcoins don't take the chance of losing your investment. 
-If your account is hacked into on coinbase the insurance is out the window.
-Coinbase will hold on to your forked coin until it is worthless (they probably trade it in the meantime and make money off it) - look at Bitcoin Cash right now - they wont release it until January

24 words in a random order is not hackable.  The private key cannot be accessed via usb. firmware updates come from trezor, its the first step in setting it up.  
sorry lots of edits.

You can but printing it could be intercepted if your pc is infected...  Just look at wikileaks to see how much shit is likely on your pc currently...
anyways its your choice but personally if Bitcoin takes off, I would feel much safer with a physical device that keeps your seed safe and a 24 word written passphrase stashed somewhere as a backup.
@_date: 2017-10-20 08:46:00
no the phrase shows up on the trezor screen and thus immune from a virus laden pc..
@_date: 2017-10-20 13:39:19
also your account is not insured if you get hacked from phishing attack or something similar.

Trezor even displays the QR code on its screen...  very simple.
@_date: 2017-10-20 06:04:13
Buy a Trezor.  Amazon.com 1 day shipping.  secure A.F.

wow cant even post a meme picture..  this website is shit.
@_date: 2017-10-20 06:33:45
sort of.  with the exception of the 24 word passphrase which can be used to restore your wallet if your trezor is physically lost.
The trezor itself requires a minimum 5 digit pass code to even access it and displays your 24 word passphrase on its own screen for an extra security level.
@_date: 2017-10-20 05:23:08
You may be right but this is so far the most secure way of storing bitcoin afaik.
@_date: 2017-10-20 13:27:59
yes, clearly.  stupid joke.
@_date: 2017-10-20 06:15:29
Trezor can hook up to your phone with a micro usb adapter
@_date: 2017-10-20 16:13:28
Depends how long you hodl...
@_date: 2017-10-20 06:21:08
I added a link to the reply, but bitcoin doesn't actually leave the blockchain.  Trezor is basically a fancy key to your personal addresses.
@_date: 2017-10-20 13:42:09
nice, you will like it.  The only problem I have is where to hide the passphrase...   do i trust it in a safe deposit box at a bank?
@_date: 2017-10-20 05:05:30
correct.  If you are really paranoid, after the initial firmware update, you can format the device and it will be fresh.  Honestly the box it comes in is nearly impossible to open and it would be clearly evident if someone tampered with it...

TREZOR is a single purpose device which allows you to make secure Bitcoin transactions. With TREZOR, transactions are completely safe even when initiated on a compromised or vulnerable computer.
copy pasta..
Also the oldest hardware wallet.
@_date: 2017-10-20 05:10:36
a paper wallet has to be printed - which can be intercepted by a hacker.  with Trezor, at no point does your passphrase leave the device - just shows on its screen and you write it down.  It is also safe to use on a computer that may be infected by a virus for this reason.
@_date: 2017-10-20 05:58:24
yup, capital gains.
@_date: 2017-10-20 06:39:59
If you are a good trader, yes.  If not, safer to hold or hodl as everyone calls it.
Buy a trezor or any other hardware wallet if its a significant amount and enjoy the rollercoaster ride.
@_date: 2017-10-20 06:04:58
50% of realized capital gains are taxed at your personal tax rate in leaf land.

If you can afford 1 BTC, buy a trezor hardware wallet off of amazon.com with 1 day shipping.
set up is easy but takes a bit of time to copy the seed phrase on the supplied booklet.  Once set up, open your BC wallet in the coinbase app and take a picture of the bar code that trezor gives you of your new bc address...  double, triple check.... send it.  Receive confirmation from coinbase and wait for 6 confirmations (you will see the transaction immediately in the Trezor).
Store the seed phrase booklet somewhere safe as F!  It can restore your wallet immediately in any wallet app. and your BC will be gone if someone finds it.  (do not take a picture of the seed phrase or save it in a computer file - hackers...)
  
The trezor itself is pin protected with at least a 5 digit pin -so much safer to keep around in a safe or something.
The trezor does not physically hold your coins but holds the key to your wallets.
Tips welcome :)  1GFjEY9SGMZk4NeCrT8Z99HujpEW4jA9i4

Trezor is one of the best ways to store bitcoin.
I beleive Trezor will send a firmware update once the fork is finalized which will give you a tool to access your new coin - much the way they handles Bitcoin Cash. (fairly quickly)
Even if Trezor decide not to, you still have access to your private keys and will be able to do it manually once the dust settles.
