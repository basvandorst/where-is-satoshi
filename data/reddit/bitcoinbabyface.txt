Bitcoin is a pretty amazing story that's in the midst of unfolding...
But take this time to realize all the other amazing things and opportunities in life that go by unnoticed everyday.
If you found yourself passionate about bitcoins you'll find yourself passionate about other things.
Educate yourself. Surround yourself with smart friends. Get involved with as much as you can. Learn about emerging new technologies that will change the world.
Be in the moment and take your bitcoin loss as a wild ride that will make for a good story years from now.
