This is true, I wouldn't under estimate the motivation of an employee to make a gain.

You don't have to tell them the truth, or anything at all. But, if you aren't doing anything wrong then what's the problem anyway? They aren't holding your funds until you give them a reason. 
Before opening a bank with Wells Fargo I told them specifically that's what I would be doing w/ that account and they accepted me right away. SunTrust has always been welcoming as far as my experience goes as well.
If you want to succeed w/ your bitcoin use, your best bet is to facilitate your tellers small talk and get to know them.**Making a personal connection with an employee in ANY business is going to make your life easier.**

Then whats the point of bringing up a debit card anyway? 
Moving money overseas is expensive. It doesn't matter if you use a credit card, debit card, bank transfer, or a currency exchange.

Well there are about 260 countries in the world (depending how you count) and localbitcoins has sellers in 231 so odds are pretty good that I will be able to find a seller.

That update is optional, as is every update.

Yeah they have been doing this in NL and BE for almost a year.

Some cards don't work internationally. If your card does work then have fun paying the fees outside of your country.

That last suggestion might actually work, as melodramatic as it is. 
During the last experience I had at a bank, a Hispanic woman who couldn't understand "withdrawal" needed to withdrawal some cash. I could tell the teller was frustrated and just wanted to end the situation. He gave her the cash and didn't ask a single question.

You bring up a great point. If you have that much money it's not a problem. Liquidity is easy when you're rich. 
Where Bitcoin shines is it's ability to help those who are under-banked locally and internationally.

Sometimes it's best not to exaggerate, how many chances does one get to sue the NSA? There are times when its best not to reach too far.

I agree, but sometimes you can't get what you want in the legal system by asking for too much. The judge isn't going to agree. In this case I think the EFF made the right decision.

Ah okay, for the SII I get a price in bitcoins returned. But for the Droid X I get no price. They say however that if I donate they will pay back in bitcoins.
I'd like to know how much they will pay in BTC if I donate and how much I need to donate, etc.

I've used the system a few times now, gets the job done and haven't had any problems thus far. 
@_date: 2013-10-26 11:38:35
How so?
@_date: 2013-10-26 01:31:45
its just deja vu. or déjà vu if you really want to be correct..
@_date: 2013-06-20 20:19:59
I really wish they would show prices for each model.
