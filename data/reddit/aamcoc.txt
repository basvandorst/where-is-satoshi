You’re absolutely right. I’ve been brainwashed by those mainstream economics that have delivered the most prosperous period in human history. Tell me, what is it that you don’t have? What does our current system fail to deliver you? Take the tin foil hat off and go grab life by the balls. 
Yes, you absolutely can ban it. You can absolutely make illegal the transfer of US dollars by US citizens into or out of bitcoin. Sure, people will still do it, but only the same minority who always used it for illicit activities.
The financial crisis was not the fault of the banking system. It was the fault of the government and ordinary people blinded by greed. The same greed that has driven bitcoin to $20k ironically.

Typical response, most bitcoin “enthusiasts” have paper thin arguments that fold under the slightest pressure. 
You just keep buying bitcoins and I’ll continue without them and we’ll see who’s better off in 20 years.

In order to replace banks, you need to eliminate central banks. This is not possible. As I said, bitcoin simply cannot fulfill the functions that a central bank is tasked with on a daily basis. These small daily adjustments keep the wheels of our economy turning. The current monetary system is so deeply engrained in your everyday life that the lack of understanding by 99% of crypto investors is nothing but hilarious. 
Do you know why you need permission to transfer funds? It’s because the government, like I said, is trying hard to eliminate tax evasion. This is done for the good of society in general. If you’re not doing anything wrong, why does it matter that the government wants to know where large transactions are going?
It’s the same for everyone. I can’t cheat, you can’t cheat, everyone is on a level playing field. Nobody gets to hide money in the domestic economy. And yes, the government can absolutely wipe bitcoin from existence if it so pleases. You’re nuts if you think otherwise.

This is the most ludicrous thing I’ve ever read. There are so many reasons why people like you shouldn’t be allowed to post in places where other people can take your word as advice, and potentially act on it. 
Bitcoin can never replace money. Ever. It’s not economically or even logically possible. The ability to control money supply (ie, expand it and contract it at ANY given time) is fundamental to the success of the monetary system. 
Secondly, governments have fought for DECADES to get to a point in time where you cannot hide one single dollar of taxable income without eventually getting found out. If you think they’re going to allow crypto to waltz in and take us back to the Stone Age in that respect, you’re out of your mind.
Let me explain to you what’s going to happen after today’s collapse in price. The SEC and other regulators are currently being flooded with complaints, to the point where they’re going to have no choice but to step in and regulate crypto out of existence as a mainstream investable asset. Remember, falling 40% from $20,000 is far different to falling 40% from $1,000. The stakes are so much higher right now and ordinary people are getting burned because of people like you.
Take a damn economics class dude.

I said you can’t get much leverage not you can’t short it
@_date: 2018-02-02 11:22:05
It’s not going to 0. Probably never will. It will sink below $1,000 and stay there for good

Can’t get much leverage on BTC sadly

Kind of like how people just bought it and got rich?
The reason half the muppets are in this mess?
BTC has, and always will be, worthless garbage.
