Will you, or present this discovery in the next Scalingbitcoin event ?
@_date: 2016-08-29 12:29:35
Because markets are emotional, irrational and can be manipulated. 
Bitcoin has values and principles and we will stick to them independently of what the market thinks at a specific time.

If your payment is not being confirmed, it can mean 2 things :
* either a block hasn't been found yet. Block creation follows a Poisson distribution which means that sometimes a new block is found 1 or 2 hours after the previous one.
* either you have not paid enough fee to get your transaction mined by a miner. Multibit should calculate the right fee for you, but I don't know enough about this wallet to know if it actually does.

Not a particular use case in mind. It improves privacy and reduces the size of smart-contracts. That's awesome :)

What's your point exactly ? That it's not gonna work ? Perhaps you are right, no idea, but I don't see how that relates to my answer to ghost012's question.

Cool story, bro.

A spinoff is a planned hardfork at a specific block. In this case they need to change the PoW (or their chain would be over taken by the main chain, as &lt;1MB blocks are still valid). It has nothing to do with friendliness. To my knowledge, the last spinoff that occurred from Bitcoin was ClamCoin somewhere in 2014 (worth $0.5 and $1M market cap).

Schnorr reduces the size of signature (Schnorr is a signing algorithm). MAST reduces the size of script (scriptPubKey). They are two different things.


I was answering OP : I find MAST really exciting and I hope to see it soon in a release. I suspect you are acting in bad faith and that it's related to the blocksize debate. I could go through your post history for evidence but I don't have time for that.  
@_date: 2016-08-17 08:51:55
was responding to the OP that was imagining a hypothetical situation where fees were $1000.
I don0t think anyone is suggesting onchain fees should rise to $1000 (your tweet on Twitter is misleading).
New tech is being build and invented. LN enables a finite number of people to make an unlimited number of transactions (without consuming the network ressources). It's a huge breakthrough. 
We can expect LN enhancements, layer 3 solutions (multiparty channels, etc.) or even Layer 1 enhancements (MimbleWimble, ...) to drastically increase the user base who can access bitcoin. 
Unless you believe everything has already been invented in the crypto/bitcoin space.
@_date: 2016-08-31 07:58:45
Having people mining while not having a clue of what there doing is not killing mining centralizing, it's making it worst. 
@_date: 2016-08-24 20:04:53
The bitcoin ecosystem isn't really developed enough for your need yet, unfortunately. Your parent would need to find a way to buy Bitcoin. Once transfered you would need to find a way to sell them into your currency. Each BTC&lt;-&gt; local currency comes with sometimes significant fees.
A promising project named [Abra]( attempts to solve this problem but its early stage and its deployment is very slow.

In this thread nobody is talking about judging 0.13. I'm answering to OP who is asking if Blockstream (who is employing 5 core devs) is controlling Bitcoin Core (100+ contributors in 0.13).

To simplify, Brave acts similarly as a Changetip with Anonize2 : Brave maintains an anonymous database of micro-txs. These micropayments can be aggregated every month by publishers and settled onchain. You can see the specification [here](

Perhaps you are right and he is being sarcastic. It's unclear knowing that in the past he has supported the idea of having a governance structure to govern Bitcoin.


I disagree with appointing a committee, just as much as letting "the market decide". Don't put words in my mouth.
@_date: 2016-08-03 18:16:26
You are more risk tolerant than others, that's how I would put it. I agree with traders bring liquidity and that's very important for the Bitcoin market (sorry for my previous unpleasant comments, please disregard them). 
@_date: 2016-08-16 19:10:05
Peers can and will go offline. Not sure what is the average uptime of a standard server but it surely isn't 100%. That's basically what means uncooperative counterparty.
Also note that not all transactions are suited for LN. High value txs won't be able to use LN because it would require every routing channel to hold at least that amount, in the correct direction: a LN node will be holding bitcoins in a hot wallet thus its users won't be willing to create channels with huge amounts.

Producing code that is incompatible with the network is futile work: nobody will review it, nobody will test it, nobody will run it. You really have nothing better to do with your time ?
If you really want to stay in your adversarial mindset towards Core, you could perform [adversarial peer-review]( of Core's code that the community could perhaps benefit from, instead of wasting time writing useless code.
@_date: 2016-08-03 11:36:19
There is a difference between 
1/ making a trade (buy or selling btc) and exiting the exchange when the trade is finished.
2/ letting your whole fortune rest on an exchange for a long periode of time.
(1) has little chances to get Goxed and if he does, it will only affect a small portion of his fortune. But he doesn't have access to margin trading and other short-term speculation goodies.
(2) will get Goxed some day and lose everything.
@_date: 2016-08-03 09:24:14
I wonder how many other MtGox and Bitfinex will be needed for people to stop leaving significant amount of bitcoins on exchanges.
I would like to understand better. The community needs to improve on that : may I ask you why you left that much money on an exchange ?
1/ Lack of education : you thought that it was perfectly safe to trust a third party with your private keys. You had never heard of MtGox before.
2/ Carelessness : using bitfinex as a wallet was convient enough to make you believe crossing your fingers would be enough to stop an attack.
3/ You needed that much money on the exchange because of specific trading operations. 
4/ Other
Thanks in advance for your answer.
@_date: 2016-08-03 18:25:19
Well that's a great business idea ! How about starting an insurance company focussed on insuring Bitcoin exchanges :)
I suspect insuring Bitcoin exchanges is more tricky because of the irreversibility of Bitcoin transactions. If there is an electronic breach in your bank, the scammy payment can and will be reversed.
@_date: 2016-08-03 12:38:40
Yup usually we define risk as :
    Risk = Probability of occurence x Impact
which in our case is :
    Risk = (duration the money stays in the exchange) x (quantity of money in the exchange)

Anyone can see the bitcoin code, download it and make changes. A few contributors have access to the Bitcoin repository hosted on Github. The full list of these contributors is not publicly known for security reasons. But any change that occur on the bitcoin repository is public and transparent. 


Yourself, by not upgrading your bitcoin node if you disagree with a change, prevents them from introducing a change the network may disagree with.
@_date: 2016-08-20 13:54:42
The contributors who have access to the bitcoin repository are long time contributors. Not random dipshits. Also the code being public means that if a change is controversial, it will create a fuss and everyone in the community will hear about it.

"Satoshi's Vision" is worst than names like "SatoshiRoundTable" or "satoshiLabs" or "NakamotoInstitute" because it speaks in the name of someone who is not here to refute.

If they have no clue what they are doing, they are unlikely to validate blocks independently. Worst, they may not even be able to change pools if they disagree with the pool policy or if it misbehaves. Zombie clueless hashers only give pools more control and power making centralization worst. It is something we should try to move away from, not encourage it.

This has already been done. Developers have coded XT and Classic. The community has rejected both.
@_date: 2016-08-16 09:13:12
Also another argument against the XT sidechain was that for it to be used as a payment network, it wouldn't benefit from the Bitcoin network effect and would have to create its own from scratch. I think this is a more valid argument against your proposal @_date: 2016-08-21 16:27:34

There are different kinds of privacy :
Privacy from network observers : running a full node through Tor and broadcasting your transactions through it offers I believe a good protection.
Privacy from blockchain observers : is more tricky :
* linking transactions together : [JoinMarkets]( an CoinJoin implementation  is more and more used.
* seeing the amounts transfered : it is not possible right now to hide the amounts transfered but *Confidential Transactions* is a solution to encrypt amounts while still being able to verify that the transaction is valid. It has not been proposed for Bitcoin as improvements are still being worked on but it is operating on the AlphaElement sidechain.
* seeing the script that defines how to spend an output : MAST (Merkelized Abstract Syntax Trees) hides the output and only shows the executed part of the script once the output is spent. It is not implemented yet but is part of the roadmap (maybe next year).
On a side note, an impressive proposal called [MimbleWimble]( has been suggested by an anonymous author a few weeks ago and improves massively privacy from blockchain observers : it uses Confidential Transactions and CoinJoin (a block is now one huge CoinJoin transaction). Also comes with significant scalability improvements. Likely a MimbleWimble sidechain will become operationnal at some point.

Google (and Github) support the U2F standard (Universal 2nd Factor), it's an option in your Google settings that you can enable to not only rely on passwords but also on 2nd factor authentication. It's much better than a YubiKey or apps such as Google Authenticator, because its screen fully protects again phishing and more over if you lost your device you can restore everything with its seed.
The Ledger Nano S doesn't store any of your passwords and doesn't replace them. It holds private keys and can sign messages (transactions or challenges). When it will support GPG, it will enable to sign/verify, encrypt/decrypt messages using the GPG key(s).

Yes but their is no need for hyperboles and exaggerations.
If the market decided at some point to transform Bitcoin into a giant Paypal that used governement managed whitelists in order to stay legal, I would oppose it. Make your own altcoin. And if this altcoin's market cap at some point surpassed Bitcoin's, then so be it. I certainly won't change my position having the deep belief that in the long run, financial sovereinty (decentralization, permissionless, privacy) or what ever you wanna call it, is what gives Bitcoin its value.
We shouldn't be like politicians starring at polls to see what next thing they should be saying/supporting.
@_date: 2016-04-05 17:33:10
You have a point but multi-sig solutions such as Greenaddress and Bitgo only prevent against double spends. It doesn't address the other blockchain problems, such as a fee too low to have the transaction confirmed or malleability (which is the problem I'm suspecting in this case). The blockchain is a settlement system by design, quoting (ironically) Jeff Garzik.

That's exactely why the Bitcoin we have now is not ready for mass-adoption. Even though I love Bitcoin, I'm certainly not ready to accept having to wait for confirmations and having the merchant ask me to pay a second time because he uses a shitty wallet. No one will accept that when VISA is instant and reliable. 
We need instant txs to reach mass adoption. May that be offchain services trusting each other, the Lightning Network or other layers on top of the blockchain suited for payments, doesn't really matter.

You failed to understand I was talking about the Bitcoin blockchain. The layer 1 protocol. To be fair, understanding protocols requires some abstraction. Some people will take more time than others to understand that bitcoin the money is not only the Bitcoin blockchain but also all the protocols built on top that can be designed specifically for scalability purposes. Some other people will of course never make the difference. Average Joe doesn't distinguish between TCP/IP and HTTP when he posts on reddit.

This is **not true**. This has been repeated ad nauseam. 
What is true is that the *longest valid chain rules*, "valid" from a full node's perspective. Miners can't decide consensus rule changes by themselves or they will be ignored by full nodes. In case of controversial changes enforced by miners, that would give justification to a PoW reset by full nodes.

@_date: 2016-04-17 18:06:45


You are incorrect, the tx fee is independant of the value, instead it depends on the size of the tx, because the size of the tx is proportional to the ressources the Bitcoin network needs to consume to process and store the txs.
I recommand you watch Andreas' [talk]( where he compares the Internet scability problems it had back then with Bitcoin's. Andreas points out that tx fees enable Bitcoin the fail to scale gracefully, with minimal burdensome. That is extremely important.
It seems you are more interested in user adoption than in long term security &amp; decentralization. Not everyone agrees here. Fortunately, with technology innovations such as the Lightning Network, we are likely to get the best of both worlds. Please be patient as the community decided long-term security &amp; preserving decentralization was the priority and is working very hard to implement the innovations that will pave Bitcoin's road to success.

Yup. But *inhibiting Bitcoin's advancement* as you put it is generally not seen as a threat as much as forcing a change on a minority that disagrees.

Who defines what a good reason is ? The whole community is sticking to the 1MB limit for now because the technical community has expressed centralization/security concerns. 
You may think these are not valid reasons. I think these are extremely valid reasons to stay at 1MB for now. When we both bought Bitcoin, we knew about this limit. If you want to change an already active rule we both agreed upon by acquiring bitcoins, you need my consent. Welcome to governance by consensus. If that makes you unhappy, you can sell and invest in something more appealing to you.

That's an interesting point. Can you expand on the volatility you are thinking about ? Like the BTC volatility relatively to the USD &amp; EUR ?
I think LN node owners will be BTC holders that actually desire to expose themselves to BTC volatility (aka speculation), but most importantly :


Is not exactly true. You can send your coins in the channel through LN to an exchange to get USD or EUR. What you say is only true when the other channel participant is uncooperative or something and you need to settle the channel on chain.

Sorry for this. I suggest you take the time to ask yourself why you have left that much money controlled by a third-party when Bitcoin was invented to free ourselves from third-parties, you should take advantage of that to lower these exact kind of risks.

Bitcoin can be multiple layers but not all protocol layers are equally important. If layer 2 LN fails (censorship, attacks,  impractical, whatever), we still have layer 1, the Bitcoin blockchain we know today. However if the layer 1 Bitcoin blockchain fails (censorship, attacks, ...), everything built on top also fails (LN, offchain services, ... everything). 
So now you should understand why people are very concerned about the layer 1 Bitcoin blockchain's health, and at the same time tolerating some centralisation on protocols built on top of it.
@_date: 2016-04-27 12:09:59
The problem is that people like you and Mike Hearn see Bitcoin as a product. People like you trying to sell Bitcoin everyday at best entertain the Buttcoin community, at worst damage Bitcoin's image to candidates that don't like things being stuffed down their throats. Bitcoin is not a product. No it's not a product or service we are selling. It doesn't need marketing. And no it doesn't need more users. Bitcoin is a protocol. An open-source money protocol. The only thing that matters is that its design stays sound to enable more protocols and applications to be built on top, while retaining its permissionlessness and security that make Bitcoin unique and valuable.
@_date: 2016-04-07 07:03:43

This is Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-04-19 13:46:42
The two teams have quite different visions : 
Classic is a new team that wants to "upgrade Bitcoin's consensus rules" urgently to allow more throughput on the blockchain, even if this change has received widespread technical criticism. They are focussed on mass adoption and user experience.
Core is a well experienced team with a strong record. They are focussed on delivering quality code and very concerned about implementing changes everyone agrees on that don't degrade Bitcoin's fundamental properties : censorship-resistance, privacy/fungibility, trustlessness, etc.
Both have a scalability roadmap, but the mining community &amp; most of the full nodes are following Core's plan.
@_date: 2016-04-08 07:22:13
That's a great explaination. I would add that LN is a protocol on which we can build applications, and perhaps other protocols on top of to increase further more scalability.
I think this is pretty abstract for many people and hard to understand. 
If we want to make some analogies, IP &lt;-&gt; Blockchain  ;  TCP &lt;-&gt; Lightning Network ; HTTP(S) &lt;-&gt; Next protocol ? , ... for example.
@_date: 2016-04-14 09:06:38
The blocksize is not being raised to 8 or 20MB because of centralization &amp; security concerns. LN has nothing to do with that. If LN hadn't been invented, we would today have the exact same 1MB limit.
Nobody is asking you to rely on anything, LN is entirely opt-in. If you don't like it, don't use it.
Problems arise when people like you will claim the right to use the blockchain without paying the appropriate fee to get your tx in. 
But hey, apparently the community decided that long-term security was more important than having a free lunch.
@_date: 2016-04-07 09:11:03
Why do miners invest in heavy mining equipement to mine Bitcoin, silly ? Because Bitcoin has value and they get a return from their investment. Mining has an important role in Bitcoin's security model, but that certainly isn't the only dimension, see checks &amp; balances of full-node validation. You have got everything backwards.

At the time of the Bitcoin XT "event", I suggested to the XT guys to build an XT sidechain with whatever blocksize. My proposal was met with outrage. As far as I can remember the argument was "This is not Bitcoin" (sic).
It's very unclear to me that scalability is a problem that requires a short term solution. However, some people seem to care very much about replacing the Bitcoin Core devs (and will use any red herring). With what &amp; why is an open question I have not found any answer to, yet.

That is *your* own definition of consensus. But even with this definition, the "majority" has voted to stay with Core with small blocks, rather than leave Core with bigger blocks.

I think you misunderstand what opt-in RBF is. It doesn't make 0-conf disappear. Users can chose between both and RBF tx are tagged as "RBF" so merchants can spot them.
However what Luke is proposing is somewhat controversial (it gives choice to miners&amp;nodes to enable full / disable opt-in RBF, if I understand correctly). His proposal has not been merged and is likely to get rejected (but Luke is free to propose what he wants). Please also note that all of the RBF stuff is relaying policy, which means that any miner/node can modify their code to apply RBF and break 0-conf and there is nothing anyone can do about it.
TL;TR : You are wrong, 0-conf transactions are not going away.
Edit : reading the PR, Luke proposes to give the option to disable opt in-RBF / to enable full-RBF.

But when you think deeper (scotch earth policy, ...), it's not retarded at all, and a technical discussion about this must take place. I am curious to see what the technical community will respond to his interesting proposal.

That is assuming if everyone in the world was using LN. But of course it won't be the case.

Bitcoin, the way it is right now, is a rather poor payment system. Have to pay a fee to wait *around* tens minutes for a 1st confirmation and *around* 1 hour to be really sure. This is a ridiculous payment system. It doesn't compete with any other. Cash is instant, free, and anonymous.
Bitcoin's value doesn't come from the payment system. It comes from its very secure, decentralized ledger. That's the only thing important. If Bitcoin becomes centralized, we lose everything, forever.

To make it simple.
The usual process to make a Bitcoin change is to open a discussion on dev mailing list, have the techies discuss it and agree on best way to implement it, then implement it on a test version, test, have techies review, then at the end the change is integrated in new version and core dev commiters commit.
The change process is long, involves alot of discussions about risks, benefits, etc..., sometimes the developpers disagree. That is the case for the blocksize.
Gavin decided the blocksize issue was urgent and decided to skip the change process. But he couldn't do that in BitcoinCore, so he did that on BitcoinXT (which is maintained by Mike Hearn). He lobbied the Bitcoin ecosystem so that miners and exchanges upgrade to his version BitcoinXT to try to force the change upon the techies that disagreed with him.
This is dangerous because by doing so BitcoinCore and BitcoinXT would become 2 currencies, spliting the network, generating confusion and lost of confidence in Bitcoin.
The miners said they support the blocksize increase but don't support Gavin's approach. They said they will only run BitcoinCore (reviewed and tested by the tech community) and they kindly asked Gavin to cooperate and find consensus within BitcoinCore technical community.
Hope it helped.

Exchanges don't decide anything, they follow the needs of their customers.

A contentious hardfork attempt is an **attempt to steal Bitcoin's network effect**. That's what Gavin and Mike are doing and it doesn't matter if they are sincere or not. 
Many other similar attempts will occur in the futur (hi 21 cap).
We need to take that as an opportunity to learn, strengthen and develop defensive mecanisms to make contentious hardfork impossible : information &amp; education, gouvernance clarification, social contract, technical defenses, ...

Unless I am mistaken "our centralized services" you are referring to are "Bitcoin Banks" like Circle and Coinbase, right ? And also exchanges ?
I am comfortable with centralized services being built on top of a *decentralized* protocole, and I think these services have a place in the Bitcoin space, so long as users have the freedom to not use them if they don't wish to.
These centralized services can provide an answer (among LN and others) to Bitcoin's scalability issue and address the users that need customer care or don't want to deal themselves with securing private keys.
Also, [proof-of-reserve]( is a promising method to mitigate the risk of fraud of these services.

Nice one, I love it. 


It's alot more than that. Majority of miners, 2 major chinese exchanges, major wallets, have publically stated they were against Gavin's proposal. Not to mention important personnalities from the cryptography community. 
0 miners, 0 exchanges, 0 wallets said they were going to upgrade to XT per Gavin's proposal. In fact XT is less than 1% of the nodes today. 
When you take away the stupid DICE spammers that bloat the blockchain with their useless transactions and pollute forums with silly polls, well, my guess is that there is not much left. 


Then who would maintain Bitcoin ? Hearn works on Lighthouse and hardly ever contributed to Core and Gavin prefers doing politics than technical work.

Bitcoin, the way it is right now, is a rather poor payment system. Have to pay a fee to wait *around* tens minutes for a 1st confirmation and *around* 1 hour to be really sure. This is a ridiculous payment system. It doesn't compete with any other. Cash is instant, free, and anonymous.
Bitcoin's value doesn't come from the payment system. It comes from its very secure, decentralized ledger. That's the only thing important. If Bitcoin becomes centralized, we lose everything, forever.
I prefer having satoshiDICE users, commercial spammers, etc be kindly driven off the bitcoin blockchain by fee pressure rather than losing Bitcoin's most important property.

For more insight, a quote from the Bitcoin Core Lead developer adressed to Mike (and no the core lead developer is not Gavin):
"Bitcoin Core is completely different from your average open source project in one aspect: where it concerns consensus.(...)
Consensus changes are *much* more difficult, on the other hand. Even relatively straightforward softforks come with a long discussion process (see BIP62, BIP66). A hardfork is hard to do at the best of times (everyone needs to upgrade their software!), and simply not possible if almost the entire technical community disagrees with you.
Bitcoin is supposed to be a robust, global, decentralized network beyond anyone's control. It makes *no sense* to try to run it as a dictatorship. This would create a handy central position where power can be applied, pushing through changes to the behavior of the system, either by force or other ways of motivation. I refuse to take part in that.
Hence, anything that is controversial needs to be considered really carefully. If I suddenly start making changes to the consensus code without full agreement, by all means take away my commit privileges."

Having a hard fork every 5 or 10 years **is** a big problem. For example if we can, Let's try to prevent having the blocksize debate over again. Everyone is losing time and energy when discussing hard forks not widely agreed upon.

A conservative approach could be to increase "slowly" in a dynamic way the maxblocksize, for example +1MB / year (like suggested by Peter Todd?). 
It could be a compromise between the concerns of seeing things grow too fast and hurt decentralization ; and the concerns of having people being left out and turning away Bitcoin.
Note that this approach could be seen as a permanent fix regarding the maxblocksize. And making it grow slowly means keeping the incentive for people to find/build layer2.0.  
And if ever at some point we want to stop the maxblocksize from growing more, that would "only" require a soft fork.

Well the next logical step if SegWit expires on Oct 2017 would be for Core to propose a 1MB SegWit (no blocksize increase), which I would enthusiastly support. 
BTW u/Riiume , calling it PandaBlocks or whatever is completely ridiculous, if we are going to go down that path we might as well rebrand Bitcoin into B8coin to please our Chinese masters ?

Also an interesting idea from A.Miller / enhanced by G.Maxwell is to [embed in the PoW function a UTXO lookup]( forcing hashers to query the UTXO set for each nonce they try.
Too bad no altcoin implemented that, would be interesting to see this in a live system.
@_date: 2015-05-06 17:46:34
That's not a solution. That a vague idea. Don't get me wrong, new ideas are always refreshing, but your article raises tons and tons of design issues. And after that we will have tons and tons of implementation issues. Btw, do you plan to release a whitepaper?
We are speaking here of a way to prevent in the short term users sending transactions that get blocked because the blocks are full while preserving decentralization that gives Bitcoin its value. 
There are really interesting alternatives like Peter Todd's replace by fee, coupled with a conservative dynamic maxblocksize increase (+1MB /year).
@_date: 2015-05-30 09:18:27




The result is disappointing. Pushing for a solution that completly ignores the concerns of part of the community, is the first mistake. Dismissing every new idea using as an excuse that "it's too complicated", "we don't have time", ... is the second. Your comments regarding the *block extension* proposal are astonishing, for example. Promising solutions like that have the potentiel to bring together the divergeant visions of Bitcoin, while scaling bitcoin with only the risk of a softfork.
@_date: 2015-05-06 09:00:15
From my understanding, this 1MB maxblocksize is as dangerous as the 20MB maxblocksize proposal.
The 1MB maxblocksize exposes Bitcoin to attacks like bloating the blocks to prevent "real users" from having their "real" transactions confirmed.
The attacker doesn't even need to be uber rich, spending around $1000 in fees per block is enough to cripple transaction confirmation. So $144000 per day would be enough to cripple Bitcoin, and that's peanuts for a powerful attacker (like the FED for example).

Who is the person that kept saying


? Is it Marshall Long (wouldn't surprise me if it was).
This is so deceitful. Hasn't he even read the [Bitcoin Core scaling roadmap]( ?
So to answer that ignorant dude, after SegWit we have:
* offchain: LN like protocols to increase throughput by a scale of x1000 to x10000 in a decentralized manner.
* onchain: Schnorr, Signature Aggregation, TreeSigs, MAST, Tx cut-through, ... overall we get from that an additionnal +50% to +100% with significant improvements on the fungibility/privacy side (that we so desperately need) .
Everything is in the Bitcoin Core roadmap, that dude didn't even read it and Eric Lombrozo certainly told him just that.
Also Roger Ver misquoted Satoshi to fit his narrative, but deception from this person doesn't surprise anymore.

Interesting ... But a lot of information is missing in this article. Especially regarding their business model. 
I read somewhere that the plan was to have all the mining devices pointing at a 21 pool, 21 taking 75% of mining rewards and the 25% remaining left for the user. That would be scamming to user who is the only one paying the electricity bill and scamming the Bitcoin ecosystem giving great power to 21 and increasing mining centralization. 
However if the users can choose and more importantly, switch mining pools, that would be a whole lot more interesting. And of course, if users pay for the chips and for electricity, they should get the mining reward to make this concept sustainable. Maybe competition in this area will lead to that. 
@_date: 2017-02-12 03:48:30
3 years ago people thought increasing the blocksize was a nobrainer and then LN was invented. Then SegWit as a softfork was invented that enhanced to initial LN invention. Last year was invented TumbleBit and MW. You don't seem to realize how much innovation Bitcoin is benefiting from. I'm convinced new inventions will enhance LN further using perhaps additional layers. Let's not try to plan everything in advance and let's let our options open.

Measuring mining decentralization seems more difficult, because a pool having 40% hashing power can lose it in 1 hour since miners can switch very easily, so not really relevant.

You may redirect your hatred towards Core if you wish, but it's just a bunch of techies that do the best they can to stay true to the principles they believe in, in this turmoil. 
My opinion is that you should redirect your hatred against the Bitcoin community that is not moving away from Bitcoin Core. We as a community are responsible for running the software containing the rules we believe in.

BU is a political coup similarly to XT and Classic. The developers of these Bitcoin-incompatible softwares (Mike Hearn, Gavin Andresen, Toomim, Zander, Stone, ...) attempt to scapegoat the current technical contributors of the main full-node implementation (Bitcoin Core) and get the community to run their software in order to change the rules of Bitcoin. 
The scapegoat topic was historically on scalability, but now that SegWit is out, the scapegoat topic is the deployment method employed (softfork).
This process by its own is unacceptable. If a proposal that changes the fundamental rules of Bitcoin has any merit, than it should be peer-reviewed by Bitcoin Core contributors and implemented in Bitcoin Core, the reference implementation.
On a more technical level, BU consists in giving the miners the possibility to create blocks as big as they wish while not bearing any of these costs (full-nodes use disk, bandwidth and cpu to validate and store the blockchain). Increasing the validation resources increases the barrier to entry to full-validation, diminishing the number of full nodes. In summary, increasing the blocksize centralizes Bitcoin and makes it more vulnerable to state sponsored attacks and capture. This is unnecessary and unacceptable for a large part of the community, especially considering the fact that Bitcoin Core has much superior scaling solutions (SegWit + Lightning Network) to increase transaction throughput.

LN needing 5MB, 10MB, 130MB or 500MB to serve 6 billion people is irrelevant to the blocksize discussion. LN itself is irrelevant to the blocksize discussion in my opinion. 
LN is surely is a very elegant way to scale Bitcoin in a decentralized and trustless manner, but if it hadn't been invented a year ago, today we would still be having the same blocksize discussion because the blockchain is by design a settlement system and if we want to maintain decentralization (which many people care deeply about), it's the only sustainable futur.

According to my understanding 1MB SegWit fixes the UTXO and keeps the 4:1 ratio the same way 2MB SegWit does. 1MB SegWit reduces the base_block size to 200KB or something so that blocks (base + witness) stay under 1MB. Maybe can clarify, perhaps I misunderstood.

The most likely scenario in the 3-6 months, is that blocks will be pretty much as they are now. Everyone will have to work to improve scalability :
* users : some users will need to change their behaviours by for example aggregating their transactions and pay a little more fees. Low value transactions like satoshiDice and lattes may be pushed somewhere else by higher fees.
* wallets : some wallets produce very inefficient transactions, They will need to improve their transactions size (Coinbase's transactions are two times the size they should be) and improve the way they manage fees (dynamic / smart fees, replace-by-fee, ...), to avoid transactions being delayed or stuck.
* protocol developers will need to produce secure and sound  code that helps scalability : SegWit is under testing and will allow more transactions to be processed on the network while adding critical fixes (malleability) and new enhancements.
As a normal user, my guess is that there is not much to worry about, if you make sure to use a wallet that manages fees properly and if you are aware that transactions on the blockchain consume network resources and consequently should not be abused.
@_date: 2016-01-10 12:45:01
I believe you are correct. 
The network would still need "some" full validating nodes storing the witness blocks, for auditing purposes. For example, if a multi-signature address sent money somewhere in the past, if you don't have the witness part, you can't know what participants authorized that transaction.

Wow. Just wow. You are looking at Bitcoin through the spectrum of a payment system. You "forgot" the store of value spectrum : Bitcoin is also a speculative/investment asset that allows people from Argentina to China to protect their fortune against inflation. [Bitcoin may also appeal to central banks to diversify their reserves]( Remember that Bitcoin is the best performing currency in the world in 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013 and 2015 and the less volatile and most liquid cryptocurrency.


Looking at Bitcoin through the spectrum of "payment system" leads to such question. You seem to think Bitcoin must compete with VISA and Paypal. The "store of value" side, they see Bitcoin as a **store of value protocol**. I invite you to take a minute to try to understand what this means and you will suddenly understand many things you missed. This protocol is maintained by Bitcoin Core devs to enable other protocols to be build on top. Bitcoin is like TCP/IP on which is built HTTP (web), SMTP (emails). TCP/IP wasn't designed for users. TCP/IP wasn't designed by users voting on features.
Ask yourself if a protocol designed by users voting who only need to register to some consider.it web site (disregarding the level of stake and technical contribution) has the same resilience as a protocol who needs technical consensus to be changed. TCP/IP wasn't designed by internet users voting.
By now you should have understood the digital gold side, why they haven't been focussed on users wishes, and why they have been working on long term sustainability, decentralization (censorship-resistance) and performance, to sum up on boring technical stuff : Bitcoin is a layer 1 value protocol (similarly to TCP/IP) on which further protocols much more suited for mass payment will be built on (like Lightning Network for example).
@_date: 2016-01-15 11:41:08
Great post. Let me just nitpick one thing:


Lightning Network is not a sidechain. It's 2 different things. Lightning Network is a protocol that is built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. As an analogy, it's like HTTP being build on top of TCP/IP.
@_date: 2016-03-15 08:35:44

Lightning Network and also 21 's Machine-to-machine microtransactions are IMO the coolest things happening at the moment in the Bitcoin ecosystem.
On the pure Bitcoin protocol level, Confidential Transactions is also very exciting to me because it holds promises to significantely enhance Bitcoin's privacy as money.
On the application layer, I'm very excited about Brave (Bitcoin browser) and a little less excited with RSK (I fail to see any significant applications yet) nor with OB (I don't think it adds much value, a decentralize silk road would be much more exciting). 
Also, alot of exciting projects are pending or have failed to materialize : Coinffeine (decentralized exchange), Abra (remittance), KeyBase.io (ID management), Slur.io (market of secrets), ...

Getting things right (fungibility, instant/routing like Lightning Network versus 10min/broadcasting on BC, ...) *before* scaling to the masses sounds much smarter to me.

Blockchain analysis of CoinJoin transactions most of the time can trivially seperate outputs by analysing values alone. See Jonas Nick's excellent video on Bitcoin privacy. Which is why CT is a fundamental improvement for privacy and fungibility.
Indeed CT requires a lot of space, but is it an argument to reject its implementation on Bitcoin mainchain ? If people are willing to pay for it, it means it brings value. A more suited argument in my opinion is that this technology may not be mature enough and optimisations are still being worked on.

Many people don't understand how new changes can be implemented in Bitcoin. 
**You can only implement a new change if there is consensus among the network contributors.**
May that be lifting the current 1MB limit via a hardfork (consensus of all network contributors) or decreasing it via a softfork (miner consensus).
Reducing limit to 0.5MB not even being considered is probably because it is controversial.

The right question to ask is *will miners that run the Classic software today, keep running it to block SegWit activation* ? (It is unlikely that Classic devs implement SegWit in Classic 0.12.X)
Since Classic was created on the assumption that scaling is more important than anything else and is **urgent**, than it would be surprizing to see the same folks blocking a short term scaling solution.
If it was the case, than SegWit would be delayed. No big deal. Note that this wouldn't necessarily delay the other planned/future softforks such as CSV thanks to version bits that enable multiple parallele softforks to be proposed for adoption to the network.

If free fees is really what got you into bitcoin like you are pretending,  I suggest you migrate to Ripple, which has fees that are less than a penny and which's design allows it to be more efficient than Bitcoin, so Ripple fees are likely to stay extremely low.
I am surprised anyone would get into Bitcoin because of low fees, knowing that basically every of the 500+ altcoins have much lower fees than Bitcoin.

The roadmap doesn't mention a 2MB hardfork around 2017.

@_date: 2016-01-14 12:03:00


The answer is Yes. Today, with a mobile, 0conf is possible with a high level of success. IMO, there is not much 0conf scams because people using mostly bitcoin are enthusiasts that try to share their passion.


Sure. 
I think the resistance is from uninformed users or users acting in bad-faith because they didn't get the block size increase they "demanded". If opt-in RBF was a bad idea, it would have received technical criticism. Please check [here]( and [here]( I don't believe Bitcoin should be governed as a democracy (it will favor politicians and populist tactics) and if it became the case, I would consider it a failed project.
I see a risk in not implementing opt-in RBF : some miners will implement full RBF on their own (Peter Todd has given them the code, and a miner already implemented it successfully monthes ago (then revert it)) and this will definitely kill 0conf. Why would they ? They are financially incentived to, because they will get more fees. Only a few nodes/miners can kill 0conf by implementing full-RBF on their own.
My personal opinion is that Bitcoin is a money protocol, the layer 1 money protocol. You don't design a protocol to improve user experience. TCP/IP wasn't designed for internet user experience. You design a protocol to ensure security, long-term sustainability and scalability, to enable innovations from applications and other protocols to be build on top. User experience is the wallet's job. (but my vision is not shared by many people, especially here on reddit).
RBS completely suits this vision, it will enable new family of features at the mempool level, for example users being able to "delete" an unconfirmed tx if they made a mistake while sending it.
It adds great flexibility in general to tx management, and avoids the dramatic case where a user sends a transaction with an inappropriate fee, and basically has it stuck and needs to wait days or weeks to see if it gets confirmed or if he needs to send a new one.
I am very excited to see how the wallets will build new functionnalities using RBF.
The case where RBF is used to double spend by newbies should be limited because both of the conditions must be met : {user's wallet is old} AND {user relying on 0conf}. 
I also see Bitcoin as a store of value protocol, and I personally don't think Bitcoin is ready for the public now, and certainly not for means of transfer and latte purchases, which probably influences my answer.
I certainly don't expect to convince you that opt-in RBF is good for you with my reply but I did my best to answer questions.

As you said, it is miner/node policy, so miners don't need Bitcoin Core to implement this (full RBF code is already available), and an important miner has even implemented full RBF in the past (and then reverted the change).
So I think complaining that *miners can switch from opt-in-RBF to full-RBF in the futur* is misunderstanding what miner/node policy really means : *miners can already switch from 0-conf to full RBF today*.
(Optin-RBF may actually be the solution from preventing them from going full-RBF in the futur).

Not sure about faster (greenaddress tx is instant) nor smoother nor private. 
I see the main benefit of lightning network over greenaddress tx as being offchain, which means it will be cheaper (in terms of ressources used and consequently fees). Another benefit, is that LN is trustless. 
Even though I am a huge fan of greenaddress, what exactely would happen to my funds if for some reasons, greenaddress was unable to sign any more tx? I suspect the funds would be lost.
@_date: 2016-01-21 03:05:22


In a face to face payment, obviously 0conf will be preferred if participants don't know each other. Payment processors can implement a no-RBF Uri payment scheme to avoid mistakes. But even without that, if a sender sends a RBF tx by mistake, he can *transform it* into a 0conf tx, by paying an extra fee, when the merchants tells him the transaction is not processing.
In any other case, receiver is likely to wait for a few confirmations so both 0conf &amp; RBF tx will be accepted...


In the link I sent in my previous post, BTCDrak describes [4 uses-cases where RBF is more efficient and saves users fees]( But mainly it solves the very painful problem where [a user]( sends a transaction with a very low fee and needs to wait *for days or weeks* just to know if it will be confirmed or if he needs to send a new one.

Bitcoin would be in a much better shape, if the foundation or the MIT had invested their money in a ptodd or a lukejr, let alone all the damage Gavin has done going politics.

I don't really agree with you. I think companies like coinbase completly have a place in the bitcoin space. Not everybody wants to control its own security, in fact, I expect a vast majority of people to not want to handle that themselves.
The big difference in my opinion between banks and bitcoin banks (like Coinbase) is that bitcoin banks will be dynamically cryptographically audited with proof of reserve / proof of solvency audits.
In fact, I believe bitcoin banks have an important role to play in scaling bitcoin and in achieving wide adoption. I just very much dislike the arrogance of some of these companies.

There are interesting tech in the pipeline. From schnorr + aggregated signatures that make CoinJoin cheaper than regular transactions to confidential transactions that adds a huge privacy bonus at some cost. Further ahead lies mimblewimble like techs that hopefully can be accessible to mainstream. 
Regarding offchain transactions, LN with onion routing offers much higher privacy than regular blockchain transactions. 
The innovation on all these fronts is pretty explosive which makes predicting the future highly speculative. 
@_date: 2016-03-03 14:21:55
1. LN coins are bitcoins. It is NOT a different currency.
2. LN uses bitcoin address since *it is* Bitcoin : yes LN and blockchain are perfectly compatible.
3. LN tx are passed indirectly from sender to the receiver in a trustless and peer-to-peer way. 
The difference is that LN transactions are routed from sender to receiver using a path and everyone can forget about the transactions after some time, while blockchain transactions are broadcasted to every peer-to-peer node and stored forever by every peer-to-peer node.
In this way, LN transactions consume much less network ressources than blockchain transactions, and can scale much better (but yet requires blockchain tx to function).
@_date: 2016-03-26 00:31:25

And in this case, how many merchants will stay with Bitpay/Coinbase ?
I personnally don't buy bitcoin in order to spend it at merchants (I prefer spending fiat) and I expect others are in my situation. I agree being able to spend it is a great nice to have, but I don't see not being able to spend it at merchants as an existential threat. 
As an analogy, no merchants accept gold as a payment, yet gold holds an important store of value property.
To answer your question, I would certainly not move to ForkedBitcoins. If two payment processors could successfully take control of Bitcoin, I would consider Bitcoin to be a failed project and sell all my coins.
When Bitcoin will be outlawed by most countries (if it ever is, my own guess is yes), will its value drop to zero ? I don't think so, yet no merchants will accept it as payment.

Yes you're right. People running old software and relying on unconfirmed transactions are vulnerable to double spends (just like today). Note that implementing opt-in RBF is considered technically trivial for wallets.


You connect with your mobile device remotely to your pc running the RBF tool. 
Regarding your LocalBitcoin example, if a scammer double spends after a person-to-person 0conf trade (because other guy has unmaintained wallet), he will get a negative comment and that will ruin his reputation. 
I would like to point out that on LocalBitcoin, when you sell coins online (wire transfert or SEPA), the buyer can always revert his payment by simply asking his bank. The only thing that prevents people from doing this is the reputation system (just like ebay).




Besides compressing tx, the link I gave you also shows that FFS-RBF adds complexity, is a nightmare to implement for wallets (again, implementing opt-in RBF is considered technically trivial), potentially has broken cases (when no more available outputs), is more costly (you need to pay a higher fee to replace your tx) and damages your privacy.

I agree the wording is this sentence is not 100% clear. But I don't think it is the most important idea of the paragraph you have quoted.
What I find important is that the author will be much more comfortable in increasing the blocksize limit once we have the technology to reduce the risks that come with an increase.


You shouldn't read this roadmap like a contract between devs and users, but more like an explanation of how Bitcoin Core sees scaling for the futur, at the moment it was written. So winning / losing the argument is not really relevant in my opinion. Ultimately, Core proposes code changes they feel comfortable with (driven by technical consensus), and the community is free to use it or ignore it.
@_date: 2016-01-13 13:21:43


Old nodes will not relay the transactions that try to replace RBF tx with a higher fee (because they consider that a double spend).




These users in this use-case should not be affected, unless they believe they don't need to wait for any transaction confirmation, which is, without RBF a risky practice even today (see Peter Todd double-spending Coinbase on the first try, using an open-source tool).

You didn't understand my comment. The user must not modify his RBF tx to pay to himself, he must modify his RBF tx to make it 0conf. The outputs stay the same, only the tx type (0conf, RBF) changes.

It would be more accurate to say that controversial changes are difficult to implement (which has also security benefits). Uncontroversial changes have always been implemented fairly fast.

Increasing blocksize linearly increases node disk ressource exponentially and bandwitdh ressource for new nodes exponentially (if they download the blockchain) =&gt; it will reduce dramatically the number of nodes containing a copy of the blockchain.
Increasing the blocksize forever is technically absurd and will result in transforming a censorship-resistant incorruptible, permissionless open-source money protocol, into Paypal, because it will be regulated, you will need to ask permission to datacenters to access the blockchain, and it will be corrupted by politics.
If you don't increase the blocksize forever (like BIP101), you end up as a settlement layer, on which you can build payment protocols much more suited and technically sound for mass adoption.

You have a good point though, that we shouldn't have to pay for garbage blogspam articles. It could makes sense to activate payment only after 30 sec or 1 min, or something proportional (with cap limit of course !) to the time spend on the page.

it doesn't matter what you think it would be called, reality is, it would still be Bitcoin. Unless you think that when Bitcoin will hardfork to 2MB we should call it something else ? Because technically changing the 1MB limit and changing the POW is the same thing : an incompatible consensus change.


Thinking that moving away from the POW SHA2^2 would mean a complete failure is like saying changing the 1MB limit would mean a complete failure. It wouldn't, it only means a hardfork. The POW algorithm chosen was arbitrary, just like the 1MB. See the memory hard proposals regarding a POW 2nd generation that would benefit mining decentralization. The only reason this proposal is not on the table is because despite mining centralisation, miners behave fairly well and the community has not much to complain about.

No, the blocksize limit must not be driven by market needs, it's a security parameter. When will Core increase the limit ?
* When blocks are full and when there is demand for more transactions ? No.
* When it will be safe to increase it, i.e. when we have new technologies like weak blocks and IBLT that reduce risk of bigger blocks ? Yes.

Eric, will you still claim trying to hardfork the network is not coercion if the majority of hashpower triggers Bitcoin Classic and Bitcoin Core decides to reset the PoW algorithm, splitting Bitcoin between Classic and Core ?

@_date: 2016-01-20 07:28:08


How can you destroy Bitcoin by giving more choices to users ? Users could chose between BitcoinClassicCoin and BitcoinCoreCoin. More implementations, more forks, more user choice ! Heh, your own argument thrown back at you.
Anyway, you have the fat bitcoin banks, the economic majority (at least that's what you claim) and the ASIC miners that seem to support BitcoinClassicCoin, so I am surprised to hear about your fear of Bitcoin being destroyed.
It would be interesting if r/bitcoin, bitcoin.org, ... supported BitcoinCoreCoin. If this would be the case, I think miners would definately revert their support to Bitcoin Classic. Or start to feel very nervous. Brinkmanship is a powerful tool in the hands of people with principles.
If we were to go down that dangerous path, with no hesitation would I &amp; my stake follow BitcoinCoreCoin.
@_date: 2016-01-12 08:18:31
So if a majority of miners mined blocks with 1000 BTC rewards (imagine for example they were forced by the Chinese governement), they would build the longest chain. 
According to your comment, you believe it would become Bitcoin. Would it really ? No it wouldn't of course. 
If something like this was to happen, the economic majority would ignore these blocks and if this was to endanger the security of the blockchain, the economic majority would fork the compromised miners away with a POW reset.
Conclusion : you are wrong.

I thought increasing tx throughput was the top item of your list :
* SegWit gives more than a +80% throughput increase. 
* Fixes malleability : opens the door to Lightning Network that increases throughput between x100 to x10000 according to estimations.

* Thunder-Network is not exactly a Lightning Network implementation and is not trustless as it relies on trusted servers.

Right, so Bitcoin Core devs are forcing the world wide community to run their code in your model ? In fact I now recall the other day Greg Maxwell knocking on my door to check if I was running the reference implementation. 
No matter how much you want bigger blocks, you can't force Core do write code they don't believe in, and you can't force the community to run code they don't believe in. That's the power of Bitcoin in action.

AFAIK, BIP75 is a proposal at the wallet level and doesn't affect the Bitcoin Core project. My feeling is that Bitcoin being open-source, anyone should be able to make proposals and consequently BIPs (with basic prerequisites) : some BIPs will be widely used and others won't, based on their merit.

@_date: 2016-06-15 09:20:48
The 2MB blocks proponents are not so much interested in doubling the capacity.
They mainly come from the 20MB XT war. They believe in massively scaling on-chain, show no interest in offchain scaling that they consider not being Bitcoin, and are mostly interested in hardforking Core away from Bitcoin because they for some mysterious reason, believe the Core developers are responsible for the Bitcoin community not bending to the changes they want to apply to Bitcoin.  
So no, I don't think the blocksize "discussion" will completely disappear if SegWit is explained better, nor if we hardfork to 2MB. 
Perhaps Lightning Network, once wildly used, will make the discussion go away, because the onchain scaling argument will then be even more silly than it is today.

A better reason in my opinion is that in the context of full blocks, "0conf" txs easily end up stuck and RBF is much superior as it can't get stuck and consequently enables the user/wallet to pay a much lower fee while have 0 risks. 
But this requires wallet adoption. Once "enough" wallets have upgraded and LN is picking up, going full-RBF is a no brainer. Until then, opt-in RBF was a good choice from Core to avoid disruption during this transition, in my opinion.
@_date: 2016-06-14 16:40:18


Toxicity in which you contribute significantly. If you think SegWit is a bad technical solution, why have you not discussed your concerns when it was introduced to the public late 2015, on github or on the mailing list ? Why wait 6 monthes and why use a bitcoin news site ?

I really don't get it. I go in a store and buy something. Merchant accepts my 0-conf. I walk out with the groceries, or the fancy watch I bought.
* Option1 : I attempt a normal double-spent. I have nothing to lose since I already have the stuff I wanted. On the other hand, the merchant has everything to lose.
* Option2 : I know a mining pool I'm good friends with and sends them privately the double spend tx. The merchant will have no idea I'm trying to double spend until it is confirmed in a block, and it will be too late for him to activate his scorched earth policy.

I suspect the explaination is two folds:
* big blockers see Bitcoin mainly as a medium of exchange rather than a store of value, so they are likely to not hold many, and make many transactions with the few they got.
* most of the wealth on the big blockers side already flew out of Bitcoin, likely to Ethereum participating to the recent pump. Which would be pretty natural since they can't get things their way in Bitcoin.

Wrong. 
LN is designed to be private and uncensorable and relies on TOR.
What is concerning however is that the blockchain itself may not end up as censorship resistant as we would like it to be. Due to mining centralisation: bigger blocks make it only worst.
LN is almost implemented, the routing question is now answered. It's like the internet. We don't know the new applications and protocols that will be build on top and its permissionlessness can make anyone innovate. This is what is so exciting about the time we live in !

You can't blame core for not writting code they don't believe in. They are not in charge of Bitcoin. Blame Classic for being amateurish and not being able to convince the community, or blame the community itself for not hardforking away from Core, if you really want to look for someone to blame.
Personnally I believe the blocksize is irrelevant for now, it only restricts the number of microtxs occuring *onchain*. Blocksize absolutely doesn't prevent more users from joining Bitcoin. I'm convinced people whining loudly are doing much more harm to Bitcoin than any blocksize limit, and I'm concluding those people are either malicious or simple-minded.

How does sending 0 BTC to people (I assume random, irrelevant addresses), improve fungibility ? From my understanding, it only improves privacy.
Also CT benefits from SegWit because the range proof, that takes most of the space, can be placed in the witness data and thus can be "forgotten" by nodes after enough validations. I feel this is something important because it means that even if a CT tx is 10 times the size of a standard tx, it will only cost 2 or 3 times more or something.

Strongly suggest you keep your bitcoins out of exchanges because ultimately they have your private keys, so they own your bitcoins. You *need* to control your private keys (you must send your bitcoins from the exchange to addresses generate from a 24 secret words you generated).
You can store your bitcoins on your computer or your phone (wallets : Electrum, GreenAddress, SamouraiWallet, ...), but the most secure is to use a dedicated hardware wallet to avoid malware and virus (ledger nano s, trezor, digital 
 bitbox).
Don't waste anytime and secure your bitcoins away from your exchange. For more infos,

And 300KB +17.7%/Y is perfect, it gives plenty of time for nodes to upgrade.

Maybe you are right. And maybe a year ago I could also have said "unfortunately" and shared some concerns. But today, we have the technology that makes the blocksize not really matter. 
The futur I see for Bitcoin is the blockchain being used for dispute resolution (a neutral court enforcing a smart-contract), for mega-transactions, and marginal usecases, everything else will be using Lightning Network. So blockchain fees won't really matter anymore. No one cares if you have to pay $10 or $20 to go to court, because it's a rare event. 
Lightning Network will only be a step, it's going to get massively improved, many LN direct applications and I suspect other protocols will be invented and built on top of LN and will pave Bitcoin's road to success. 
The futur is really bright. That's why I think people like u/redlightsaber or Roger Ver or Olivier Janssens, who repetedly make deceitful and negative comments about Bitcoin are not Bitcoin enthousiasts. They are a drag for the community. These people are likely to have already sold all their Bitcoins and have invested in something else.

The cool thing about LN is that it doesn't require consensus anymore (unlike blockchain layer 1), only requires interoperability. This is cool because if major hubs start to ask for your KYC info or make similar incompatible changes, you (your software) will automatically route around them and ignore them. Moreover, LN has onion routing, this means that hubs don't know anything about who make payments made through them and to whom, this ensures good privacy and censorship resistance.
Major hubs could start raising fees, yes, but the barrier to entry is quite low and permissionless, so they will be replaced by more competitive hubs and/or will be routed around by participants.

That's a good question. My guess is that rebalancing your channels yourself will cost you more than paying to route a real payment that rebalances your channels.
For example, if the cheapest path (10 hops) to rebalance your channel costs you *10f* in fees, than you can save money by giving *f* or *2f* to someone that is making a real payment and for whom it makes sense to route through you to rebalance your channels.

Only the consensus layer requires consensus. 
Innovation can still occur on the P2P layer without requiring coordination from anyone (such as Compact blocks in 0.13.0), or on the application layer (such as TumbleBit). Everything doesn't need to be done on the consensus layer. 
But indeed it would be really nice if SegWit is activated because solving malleability will open up new use-cases on the application layer and pave the path to Lightning Network, a whole new exciting world that has the potential to give Bitcoin a new dimension.
@_date: 2017-08-11 10:12:18
Once an LN channel is open, you can make an unlimited amount of LN transactions. So in an ideal world 7 channels opened per sec enables to on-board 7 billion people in 4.6 years. In reality, channels will sometimes be closed by participants and the blockchain will still be used for high value payments. But still, that's really impressive scaling improvements.

Yes. Because people can send value to other people and this value is denominated in bitcoin. I'm not saying it's trustless nor secure, but ultimately it's a bitcoin transaction.


SegWit is deployed as a softfork. The governance process is identical to CSV and CLTV. I haven't heard you squeal in outrage during these past upgrades. Miners are free to reject it by refusing to upgrade. Node operators are free to reject it by refusing to upgrade. Users are free to reject it by continuing to send non-segwit transactions.

Dunno. A few reasons maybe. 1) Not wanting to run a version that has received less peer-review and less testing than Bitcoin Core. 2) Not wanting to participate in erasing unsecure 0-conf tx, that apparently some people consider a useful feature. 3) Maybe for purely morale reasons, because double-spending is evil

Speaking about privacy, I have a question for you Manfred. Let's say Bitcoin gets outlawed in some jurisdictions and law enforcement starts to bait BitSquare users with fake trades in order to out them using their banking accounts and prosecute them. 
Have you though of ways to mitigate this in BitSquare? Perhaps increasing the deposit to make outing more expensive ?
@_date: 2016-11-30 19:22:54


Yes this is correct. From what I understood, you won't even be forced to monitor the blockchain yourself because you will broadcast the txid you need monitored to voluntary LN nodes that will monitor and broadcast the breach tx (all channel money goes to you) in case your channel buddy tries to cheat you.
@_date: 2016-11-10 20:11:37
To address your question n°4 I need to explain what a hash function is. They are really amazing functions. They have a fundamental property: they cannot be reversed. If I give you 'y' you have absolutely no way to find 'x' such as y=Hash(x). No matter how much computation you have. 
They also always output a specific size. In Bitcoin we use SHA256 that outputs 256 bits.
This being say, let's go back you your question. We say a miner found a block (full of transactions waiting to be confirmed) when he has found a solution (called S) that solve an inequality similar to:
    Hash(Hash(block)||S||Hash(previous_block))) &lt; 00000000001234
00000000001234 is the target of the puzzle defined by the network. The smaller it is the harder it is to find a solution. The target (difficulty of the puzzle) is adjusted every two weeks by the network so that blocks are found on average every 10 minutes.
Since Hash functions cannot be reversed, the only way to find blocks is to try the hash function with many many many S (called nounce) and hope to find a value below the target. When you find a block, you have a proof that you have done a whole lot of work. We say the Bitcoin is secured by Proof-of-Work (PoW).

It's much better than "spendable" gold in my opinion. It's safer to store (and to transport, gold doesn't pass the xray machine test at airports), you can hide your seed (private keys) using steganography and even encrypt it with a passphrase. And it's also programmable, you can define under what conditions your bitcoins can be spent.

This letter stresses unimportant things:

* Sure devs don't have control over the protocol. Why doesn't the letter include miners ? ViaBTC signed this letter but stated a few weeks ago that miners are in control.
* Many members of the technical community have expressed doubts on having multiple implementations, because these need to be bug-for-bug compatible between each other. Is having multiple implementations really a core value of Bitcoin ?
As you mentioned *Security-resilience, immunity from political influence, privacy-fungibility* are the most critical properties of Bitcoin. These properties inherit from the decentralisation of Bitcoin's infrastructure: mining and validation.

Currently 0 value outputs are not relayed by nodes for UTXO bloat concerns. 
For the reason you mentioned, it could be useful to be able to create transactions containing a 0 value output to enable CPFP by the sender (as well as the receiver of course). This is especially useful for CSV transactions but also for pre-signed offchain transaction schemes (that rely on a specific txid) where RBF doesn't really bring a satisfying answer.
Do 0 value outputs absolutely need to be stored in the UTXO set ? Could we make a special rule for them to be discarded from the UTXO set ?

Sounds like the "this restaurant is over-crowded, nobody goes there anymore" argument. This aside, two important points :

Balanced channels are more efficient than unbalanced ones in the sense that the former allows bidirectionnal routing while the later will allow one way routing. Consequently, balanced channels will enable more routing and generate more fees than unbalanced ones.

Interesting perspective u/jonny1000
In case of a 75%(new)/25%(old) split if investors value the two chains equally, fees will be much higher on the old chain (thanks to dynamics fees, RBF and CPFP) giving a huge financial incentive for miners on the new chain to join back the old chain.
In any case, investors will decide the faith of Bitcoin under this scenario and the losers will be the investors/miners who picked the wrong chain.

SegWit opens the door to further on-chain capacity improvements such as Schnorr signatures (+25%) and then signature aggregation (another +25%).
So +X%/year in maxblocksize will result in roughly +1.5*X%/year in on-chain capacity.
Capacity improvements on layer 1 have a multiplicative effect on the capacity of the layers above. Let's say LN increase capacity by 100 (estimations range from *10 (beginning) to *1000 (mature)).
Then a +17%/year increase in MaxBlockSize brings a +2550%/year capacity increase on layer 2, with the current improvements in the pipeline. In reality, we can expect much more optimist numbers because there is no reason to believe innovation will suddenly stop.

If I own a business in let's say the US and have customers all over the world that all pay me in bitcoin. I may hire some employees or consultants all over the world and pay them in bitcoin. How can the US government guess my revenue and profit ? Hell, my business can completely opt-out of the system and doesn't even need to be registered.
Bitcoin businesses can be created and live completely outside of the system and outside of the governments radars. 
When bitcoin didn't exist, this was impossible. 
It makes managing a black-market company easy. Before Bitcoin was invented, that was extremely difficult.

That's a good question. There are solutions to mitigate this risk using pre-signed RBF (replace-by-fee) txs with different levels of fees or CPFP (child-pays-for-parent) on non-CSV outputs, but there is certainly room for more elegant solutions in my opinion.

@_date: 2016-12-17 17:30:02
I think the correct approach is to wait until November 2017, the end of the SegWit activation period. If SegWit is not activated by then, it only means the mining community has little interest in the malleability fix and scaling. That's frustrating for users and companies but we can't force a change on others. If miners reject the soft-fork proposal, than so be it, but that certainly doesn't give justification to push a risky and controversial hardfork.
It's up to the technical community to propose the future enhancements and it's up to the community to accept or reject the proposed changes. We should not derive from this robust model in my opinion.

Roger is a spoiled kid who feels ignored by the technical community, for him that is unacceptable and unforgivable. 
He is used to technical people obeying his wishes and he gets very upset when this doesn't happen. Two examples :
* When he demanded that every core contributor spoke against Theymos' moderation policy of r/bitcoin and litterally got 0 responses from them, he was outraged.
* When he emailed Greg Maxwell asking him to promote his web site and got 0 response from him (Greg considered it as commercial spam), he was outraged.

Both are very good hardware wallets. I own and have used both. While Trezor has slightly better user experience my own personal preference goes to Ledger nano S because it has better security (I'm paranoid) : 
1) it uses a secure element 
2) you can enter your seed on device without losing the 256 bit security
3) you will be able to enter your passphrase on device too (in a future release).
@_date: 2016-11-04 19:36:06
The title is misleading. Roger didn't exactly say that. AFAIK he said he won't be blocking SegWit by himself (which we previously could assume since bitcoin.com only has 2 or 3% of the hashrate).
SegWit is fantastic but there really is no rush to have it deployed IMO. Lightning Network is not ready anyways. Patience.

A channel is useful if it can route both ways. If it can't route both ways anymore because it is imbalanced, it is less useful.
So I think the technical reason is that small amount txs have little influence on the lifetime of a channel while txs with bigger amounts routed will imbalance channels forcing its owner to close it and open a new one.

I'm wondering if it should not include the algorithm. What are your thoughts on the Andrew Miller [proposal]( that suggests :
    H(header||nonce||H(utxo_lookup(H(header||nonce))))
So that validation is performed by hashers. If a POW change happened, switching to "just" Keccak or whatever would not solve the problem, it would just kick it down the road.
@_date: 2016-11-29 09:54:15
So if I was from an intelligence agency and was trying to destroy Bitcoin, I would try to divide and conquor the community by tricking the mining pools into running incompatible software.
This is rather easy because there are only a handful of mining pools to target and they are well known. You need to make them think they are in control and that the community will follow them where ever they go, because you know ... sha256.
Once they run their incompatible software, we have a great attack window during which we will buy the mining pools' fork. Depending on how we succeed in tricking the community, this could be costly but what is important is to split Bitcoin in two forks of somewhat equal value, and then the job is almost finished. The two sides will wither in an endless civil war and the technical community will give up on Bitcoin.

What is the purpose of the *POW which involves queries against the UTXO set* idea ? Why is it important that a hasher holds the UTXO set ? I don't see how it implies hashers validating.

Fees go the miners (that secure the network with hashpower) because that is how the system is designed. Running a node is voluntary but they are very important components to Bitcoin's infrastructure. If because it costs too much to run a node their numbers drop, it will make the remainings more vulnerable to DDoS attacks and validation of the systems rules will be concentrated in the hands of a few. Which is highly undesirable.
@_date: 2016-11-04 20:10:03
That's an odd security model. I guess it is similar to what blockchain.info is doing.
This security model seems weaker than deterministic wallets, where the wallets generate a random seed (24 words) that the user writes down on a piece of paper which allows him to regenerate his whole wallet in case the device is lost, by using only basic crypto.
For example, if Airbitz was compromised (by an insider for example), it could send an update to the users that destroys the encrypted keys and the hacker could cryptolocker Airbitz servers for ransom or delete it to piss everyone off.
Or if Airbitz gets shutdown (Government, bankruptcy, DDoS, ... whatever) but some users are unaware of it, once their device is lost or something, these users lose everything.

What makes BitSquare really attractive to me is it's security: it's the most secure way to trade bitcoins. Smart-contracts, no custody, third-party arbitration in case of a dispute, no central points of failure.
In terms of privacy, with native Tor support, they are also much better than Exchanges. Only the transaction participant knows who you are.

So money is usually defined by 3 attributes : store of value, medium of exchange, unit of account.
For Bitcoin, we can't have all three immediately. We will get there with patience.
The first attribute is store of value. Core devs are doing a great job at   protecting Bitcoin's value with they security driven approach and their cautiousness.
The second attribute is medium of exchange. This can be done with layer 2 technology such as LN. It cannot be done on the layer 1 because it threatens decentralization : layer 1 is a broadcast system where every participant validates everything. It doesn't scale without centralizing the system. Decentralization is fundamental to Bitcoin as a store of value, because its security derives from it.
The third attribute is unit of account. This will be the ultimate step where Bitcoin is a reserve currency. We could have unit of account right now, but we would need the peg Bitcoin's value to the USD, which I hope you agree with me, would be complete none-sense.

You repeated this twice in the same post, but that doesn't make it true. It's completely wrong. You're completely wrong. You understand neither what consensus means, neither what Bitcoin *is*. Read again your silly sentence please and think about it. I will take a little example. If the "majority of the hashing power" decides to keeping the block reward to 25 BTC for ever or more, over-riding the 21 M cap, will you still sing your song "the consensus that matters, the only consensus that matters, is that of the majority of hashpower. That's what Bitcoin is." ???

I have good news for you. SegWit has been released and will double Bitcoin's capacity once fully adopted and enhancing dramatically Bitcoin's possibilities. This will give time for Lightning Network -the layer 2 Bitcoin - to be implemented, enabling massive capacity especially for small value transactions. Free, instant and more private. This is a big deal.
@_date: 2015-07-09 10:46:18
What incentives do miners have to follow those fees ? 
Multiple input transactions take up space, space is scarce, and miners are incentived to chose the transactions with the highest fee/KB.
@_date: 2015-07-04 17:30:06
Well it's a little more complicated than that. You can breakdown a "bitcoin wallet" into different parts :
1) key management : key creation, key storage and signing (example hardware wallet Trezor)
2) transaction management : creation, broadcast, receive addresses (example Electrum)
3) information about your transactions confirmations (example *your bitcoin node*)
Most wallets provide all of those in one, but you surely don't have to. For example Electrum lets you use Trezor (hardware wallet) to manage the keys and also lets you use your own node to retrieve information about your transactions confirmations from the bitcoin network. And this configuration is definitely a best practice.
@_date: 2015-07-24 09:52:43
Dude, if low fees and instant transactions is really what you want right now, why don't you just go to Ripple and stop wasting your time whining your non-sense on Bitcoin forums ? I really don't understand some people.

I went on your site and found this :


Why do you promote *online wallets* ? They are the most insecure of all types of wallets, where users don't even own their private keys.
I would advise you not to spend your time and energy trying to explain what bitcoin is, how it can be used, ... others have worked hard on that, and you should use what they did by simply linking to the relevant [material]( and *nothing more*. Moreover, this material is updated as Bitcoin evolves, so you won't have to worry about your page becoming full of obsolete information.

Oups. Thanks for correction.
@_date: 2015-08-31 14:14:01
The decision process in Core is called *consensus*. It means that if there is technical and sound criticism in a proposed change, the change doesn't get implemented in Core. This process is not perfect, it's kind of slow, but it's well suited for a money protocol that requires stability &amp; security and is extremly difficult to corrupt.
XT doesn't use consensus. They use ["Mike makes the final call"]( which means that BitcoinXT has a **leader**. That means if you disagree with a change (like blacklisting, or whatever), well too bad, you swallow it or go away. It also means that the currency is more vulnerable, because the leader can be corrupted and become a single point of failure (bribery, threats, ...).

No they don't have a duty to use the max, in fact that would be unhealthy. Miners are free to include the transactions they wish in the blocks they mine: I am perfectly fine and I even encourage miners like Eligius that have a policy of their own and sometimes mine blocks of 400KB or so.

No it's not low-cost. Each transaction is propagated to every node and stored redundantly. That's data costly.
No it's not instant. It's approximately 10 min before 1 confirmation and approximately 1 hours (6 conf) to be sure. But the way the system is designed, you might wait 2 hours to get your first confirmation. And 0-conf transactions are insecure.
**You already have the currency of your dreams with Ripple**. I bold it because you seem to have missed my point previously.
Ripple is instant, it's way cheaper than bitcoin and it's also worldwide and has a native currency. So why do you get stuck with Bitcoin ? Go to Ripple and leave Bitcoin to the people who understand why decentralisation is extremely important.

The current gouvernance model of Bitcoin is based on consensus of the community (a change in the consensus code requires widespread consensus).

@_date: 2016-02-24 21:59:09
Hey little fish. There is a 2 sided technical argument and a philosophical argument.
Technical argument: your $5 purchase is downloaded by every node, verified, then relayed to the whole network, then when a block is found, your $5 transaction is included in a block which is downloaded again by every node, verified, relayed, and stored into the blockchain of the 5500 full nodes of the network. Now that's a whole lot of bandwidth, CPU, and disk used by the network for a $5 transaction. That's very inefficient and it's not scalable unless you are willing to give up other things like decentralisation and security. So we are scaling bitcoin as new technology enables it to scale, the best we can, ensuring the blockchain stays secure and decentralized. The second side of the technical argument is that efficient payment protocols are being built on top of the Bitcoin blockchain. You mentioned the Lightning network. *The Lightning network IS Bitcoin*. And perhaps other protocols will be build on top, similarly to the internet being build on different layers (tcp/ip + http for example). "I'm afraid of http because that will leave me out of the tcp/ip party".
The philosophical argument is that Bitcoin is many things at the same time. Digital gold, a means to store value efficiently without having to trust anyone, a censorship-resistant means to transfer value "borderlessly", a way to write digital content forever redundantely on 5500 synchronized databases, and many other cool and fun things. Many different use-cases, means many different people interested. If you want to change the rules, like increasing the blocksize, like your OP implicitly suggests, you need to make sure everyone is okay, else the people disenfranchised will split and Bitcoin won't exist anymore as we know it, we will have multiple Bitcoins. That's the difference between democracy and consensus : the former has winners (majority) and losers (minority) ; the latter has everyone a little unhappy because they can't have it their way.
@_date: 2016-02-01 14:08:22

Right now changing the PoW is not something that is considered, because the ASIC mining farms are providing strong security to the blockchain and to the bitcoin users.
However, if mining centralisation became a problem to the point that it became unacceptable to the community, let's say for example if censorship or unilaterally changes disconnecting many full nodes from the network, were implemented, then in these extreme cases the community would want to pivot away from them with an algo change. 
With the knowledge we have now, it would still be PoW but a different function.

Your last question is misleading. With today's data, the choice would more be like :

- a handful of nodes processing millions of tx/sec
@_date: 2016-02-03 22:21:35
That's a great question ! The type of encryption used enables nodes to verify that the input values are equal to the output values (without knowing the values themselves). This is possible because the type of encryption used preserves addition (E(x+y)=E(x)+E(y)). So basically,  when verifying a transaction, the nodes will sum up the encrypted input values, sum up the encrypted output values, and then verify that the 2 sums are equal (I simplified a little bit, but that is the idea).
@_date: 2016-02-15 12:33:23
You think all of Bitcoin's value comes from it's hashing power. I think it's the other way around, it's Bitcoin's value that incentivizes more hashing power. Changing PoW could hurt the network effect, but I certainly don't consider that as a significant obstacle.
It's better to split if we share incompatible visions, rather than having always the same losers (Gavin and his horde) being unhappy about Bitcoin and continuisly attempting power grabs on the protocol governance.

I'm disappointed you only picked out 2 words from my last answer (5 points I addressed) to build some kind of weird rethoric around it. I expect better quality discussions with people I engage with.
Nevertheless, I'm a nice guy so I'll answer the point you have raised.
Bitcoin banks = Coinbase, Circle, etc...
90% of Earth's population don't want to deal with security themselves and want to have support in case of need, and consequently, most people won't want to hold private keys themselves. And that is pretty good, because the UTXO set can't handle 6 billions users anytime soon anyways.
So yeah, I think Bitcoin Banks have an important role to play in the futur of Bitcoin's scalability. 
@_date: 2016-02-15 09:56:01
Jeremy Allaire, CEO of Circle seems just as dumb. He declared on twitter the other day the astonishing : "given the inability of BTC Devs to innovate on bitcoin protocol, ETH looks promising for next wave of crypto apps", while SegWit is enabling an explosion of profound improvements and while his company never spent a penny to fund core developments.
It's like Coinbase and Circle CEOs are competing against each other on who will make the most retarded statements.

What you call a privacy feature is a fundamental breakthrough that enables transactions values to be encrypted on the Bitcoin blockchain.
If this is implemented in Bitcoin (and it looks like we may be on track for it thanks to segwit), it will give a huge privacy boost to Bitcoin and make regulator's job a nightmare.
Since a bit less than a year, Blockstream has been in the center of a strong discredit campaign, which is surprising regarding how much effort they have put it bringing innovation to Bitcoin. People wonder who is behind it.

It is a blocksize increase because:
* now the block size limit = base = 1MB blocks
* with segwit the block size limit = base (1MB) + witness/4 = 1.7 to 2MB blocks.
So with SegWit, the block size limit increases from 1MB to 1.7 - 2MB.
@_date: 2016-02-21 07:11:08
Because bigger blocks endanger the network security and decentralisation. If we want to build efficient (payment) protocoles on top of the blockchain, it must be secure and decentralised.

You can blame Core if that makes you feel better, but Core has nothing to do with blocks being full. Core doesn't decide those rules, they just write code the network decides to run or dismiss.

TLDR: &gt;85% of hashpower + exchanges + CTOs of the BTC ecosystem:
1) **support SegWit and its deployment**
2) do not support an urgent hardfork right now
3) express the need to work with Core and clarify the roadmap
4) **believe that hard-forks without widespread consensus are dangerous**
5) encourage all contributors to come together

Block size described as *critically important* in the roadmap. Did you actually read the roadmap ?
@_date: 2016-02-24 17:26:12


My understanding is that if a node tries to cheat (the only way to cheat is by broadcasting an obsolete transaction/channel state), the other node of the channel broadcasts the last transaction representing the last channel state, and consequently the channel between the 2 nodes is closed and the 2 nodes receive their respective bitcoins according to the last channel state, after the freeze period.
So the cheater doesn't lose everything. Did I miss something ?

The only reason Core would want to merge the technical inferior 2MB HF solution, is to stay "in power". I think Core neither wants power, neither will accept being corrupted by politics. 
For these reasons, I think Core compromising to 2MB HF is unlikely, more likely is Core not releasing any software or resetting PoW because mining centralization has introduced political vulnerabilities in the Bitcoin governance model, enabling a part of the community (minority or majority) to force a change on another part.
But anyway, Bitcoin is full of surprises.

That's the typical rethoric from people how expect Bitcoin Core to add code to avoid external economic events, and if code isn't added, they accuse Core of hard-forking Bitcoin.
Bitcoin Core doesn't have the same vision and certainly disagrees with becoming a sort of Central Bank that would be required to add code each time to avoid so called economic events (or fee events) or to match economic demand.
Bitcoin Core is a group of technical contributors that agree among themselves on the technical changes that can be proposed to the network. The network is free to adopt or disregard them.

Due to the explosion of innovation in Bitcoin, we should expect awesome use-cases in the futur where Bitcoin will be the only possibility, ranging from micro-transactions to smart-contracts.

Logically, it will reflect in Bitcoin's value. People will see less value in Bitcoin and will simply sell. No need to blame other people than the ones trying to change Bitcoin by politics and thus undermining the system.

I said I was excited by the fee market. I see a futur where centralized services play an important role in helping Bitcoin scale, but not the only one. LN is a very interesting other option. We can expect new technology to be invented to help Bitcoin scale. The idea is to let people chose, and if LN succeeds, I expect centralized services to partly migrate over LN. Users should be free to chose the technology they prefer, but take responsibility for the cost reflected by the technology's efficiency (centralized &amp; LN free because very efficient ; blockchain not free because ineffcient).


Please can you stop your exagerations ? A fee market doesn't mean people won't be able to use the blockchain anymore, it means that they will use the blockchain when they need it enough to pay for it. Decentralization has a cost.


Should centralized services be *always* avoided for low value transactions ? Do you need high trustlessness, high security and high censorship-resistance each time you buy a morning coffee ? Technical arguments please, no political rubbish.

Nobody is advocating "we" don't want $5 outputs. Please don't say that. It is up to the users to decide for themselves.

Well, in this case, this hypothetical central LN node would need to be incredibly rich and be willing to freeze all his bitcoins to be useful.

I very much agree with you. What ever the outcome of this 2MB HF with Classic nonesense turns out to be, this episode has demonstrated Bitcoin is vulnerable to political decisions overriding technical decisions. 
Maybe we will find technical mechanisms to dissuade groups of people from enforcing controversial changes on others, like automatic PoW reset if a node detects a sufficiantly long invalid chain with valid PoW (and inventing some kind of "invalid chain / valid PoW proofs"), until then, Bitcoin will always be vulnerable to groups lobbying miners to enforcing controversial changes that aren't controversial enough to justify a PoW reset.

I think sometime in 2018 is very reasonable for a hardfork. This gives enough time to allow us to solve the blocksize problem permanently with a flexcap and to add a number of other [desirable improvements]( including fungibility improvements we so desperately need like ETD (encrypt then disclose). Hopefully it will be the last time we need to hardfork, so we don't need to go through this whole mess ever again.

I'm not 100% convinced by this password manager feature. 
You say that all passwords can be restored from the seed. But then how do you change your password (because passwords need to be changed) ? How does Trezor assign different passwords to different applications (passwords need to be unique) ?
You say no additionnal backup is required. But then why are passwords (even if encrypted) stored on dropBox ? They shouldn't be stored anywhere.
I think these hardware wallets are much more convincing for 2FA / U2F. They even make passwords completely useless.

Because with the current technology, all transactions need to be stored forever. When a new node wants to enter the network (or an existing node that got its database corrupted), it needs to download the whole blockchain. If blocksize grows exponentially, it makes it exponentially harder for new nodes to join (and existing one to stay in).
Bigger blocks also give a competitive advantage to larger miners and would centralize the mining space further than what it is today.
In general, centralizing the Bitcoin infrastructure is offering fewer targets to attackers, and potentially country-state level attackers.
Hopefully, innovation will help solve these problems. For the node problem, I remember u/ptodd at some point was working on utxo/txo commitments that would not require nodes to download the whole blockchain. Also MimbleWimble (anonymous athor), even if it is very disruptive, suggested a clever way to forget about old txs using a technic called tx cut-throught (invented by Maxwell I believe).
*TL;DR*: bigger blocks would centralize and weaken the Bitcoin infrastructure and make Bitcoin more vulnerable to attacks.

I'm not 100% sure but I believe CSV is capped to 50 years or something. 
But if CSV is set to 1 year, you will need to wait 1 year to have your channel settled onchain if your peer is unresponsive/uncooperative. So 1 year seems way too long in the context of Lightning Network.

When you submit a transaction to the network, you set a fee attached to your tx. Miners sort tx by fee, so the higher fee you provide, the sooner your tx is likely to get confirmed.
Today, many people are worried that blocks are full, but few realize that blocks contain many low value tx (such as SatoshiDICE tx for example). In fact, when you look at metrics, [50% of the tx outputs are less than $5]( : this is very important because it means **blocks are full of microtransactions that obviously don't have much economical substance**.
So what will happen with full blocks ? These micro-transactions are likely to take longer and longer to confirm and end up being pushed from the blockchain, because **it doesn't make any sense economically** to buy something 15 cents with a 10 cents fee. Note that **it doesn't make any sense technically either**, because the 15 cents tx will consume as much bandwidth, CPU and disk storage of each of every node of the network, as a 10 millions dollar tx.
So no, the sky is not falling. Micro-tx will be pushed from the blockchain (either be aggregated, go offchain, or go bloat some other blockchain) and pissed users that didn't get things *their way* will likely move to something else. 
Besides that the futur seems pretty bright to me.

The Seller can open a channel with any LN(n). Why would LN(n) care who Seller is ? Seller can even run Tor and LN(n) will open a channel with Seller without even knowing his IP (he will only know a bitcoin address Seller controls). LN nodes will open channels with anonymous people because they have no risk of losing funds and it will be a way for them to earn interests on their bitcoins (even though fees are estimated to be extremely low).


Yes. With old plain-chain txs, everyone will see You &lt;-&gt; Seller. It can leak information about your wealth to the Seller (depending on which inputs you use) and if your Seller gets caught and his computer seized by law enforcement, and if you used a KYC service like an exchange, law enforcement with sophisticated chain analysis could possibly knock on your door. With LN chain analysis won't be possible since txs are offchain.

Hi Thomas.
This article is a rehash on the blocksize debate. It doesn't add any substance to the discussion. 
I am shocked to see someone that claims interest in Bitcoin's scalability show disdain towards the layer 2 solutions such as the Lightning Network, that dramatically improves Bitcoin as a payment system in scalability, user experience (instant txs) and privacy. 
Obsession for the onchain scalability &amp; dismissing how this negatively impacts Bitcoin's other critical properties (resilience against state-attackers, decentralization, ...) is a sign of narrow-mindness at best, perhaps malice.
Take your none-sense somewhere else please, this crap has been rehashed ad-nauseam.

You would have a payment channel opened somewhere with a node called LN1. Your seller would also have a payment channel opened somewhere with a node called LN2. Your seller would give you his Bitcoin address and you would send the bitcoins through Lightning Network. Let's say the payment is routed via these two Lightning nodes LN1 and LN2 : You &lt;-&gt; LN1 &lt;-&gt; LN2 &lt;-&gt; Seller. LN1 would see the payment go through him, from you to LN2. LN2 would see the payment routed through him, from LN1 to your seller. Your seller would see the payment arrive to him from LN2. At the end of day, nobody will link your bitcoin address to your seller's address. Not even the seller.

The current offchain solutions we have are centralized databases. Changetip, Coinbase, Circle for example. Centralized solutions aren't satisfying because participants need to register.

Lightning Network is a whole different beast. It relies on the blockchain at its core and doesn't require anyone's permission to use it. No ID. No censorship. Instant, private and probably free. Lightning Network *is* part of Bitcoin as much as email or whatsup *are* part of the Internet.

From this exceptionally well researched report :
"The even greater risk associated with a lack of confidentiality/anonymity and likely one of the biggest risks to Bitcoin in general is the potential negative impact on fungibility. We believe that fungibility will ultimately be critical to Bitcoin retaining its value.
If a particular Bitcoin is worth less because it has been “tainted” due to association with a nefarious address or transaction it could compromise the value of all Bitcoin
s. Of course, it’s only possible for a Bitcoin to be “tainted” if
individual Bitcoin can be identified and linked to specific addresses and transactions. At least partially reassuring in this respect is that there are solutions available that help improve privacy (e.g. “tumbling” services like CoinJoin) and that this issue is front and center for many of the developers that contribute to improve Bitcoin and they already have a few techniques available that likely help mitigate risks to fungibility. Methods to improve privacy, such as by concealing transaction amounts as in Blockstream ’s “Elements” sidechain, are currently being developed and could potentially be used in a Bitcoin context in the not too distant future. In addition, second layer solutions such as lightning networks, sidechains, and privacy-specific layers (e.g. TumbleBit) also show early promise for improving the privacy of Bitcoin transactions. The gold standard for privacy is the ability to be able to withhold as much information as possible (transaction amounts, addresses, etc) but to have the ability to selectively reveal transaction activity and information exclusively to intended parties.
We’re optimistic that this will eventually be possible in

Can you link to this suggestion from Core ?
My understanding is that miners prioritize txs by *fee_per_KB* to maximize their fees (KB of the base block, not the witness block).
So if a miner has a choice between a SegWit tx and a non-SegWit tx that both pay the same *fee*, he will choose the SegWit tx because it takes less base space. This can be transposed as SegWit txs will cost less fees than non-SegWit txs, if miners mine to maximize their fees.

The technical community is extremely excited by this opt-in *bitcoin* technology. It is very likely to be decentralized (anyone can become a LN hub without requiring any permission, and centralized hubs to exist would need to put in a hot wallet a huge amount of bitcoins) and it is a suitable replacement for small txs (LN won't work with mega txs, but the $2-a-day-half-of-the-world you are refering to aren't likely to make any). It also improves privacy (your txs aren't published to the world). Oh and it's instant (not a 10 min - 60 min Poisson distribution). Like cash.
We should all be extremely excited. But a small minority wants LN to fail for political reasons.
@_date: 2016-09-22 18:22:50


Bitcoin Core is an open-source software maintained by contributors from all over the world (US, Canada, Netherlands, Switzerland, HongKong, ...). Anyone can fork the code and implement any changes. It has indeed been done in the past (Clams, Bitcoin XT, Bitcoin Classic) but these forks haven't received significant support from the community if you consider metrics such as hashpower or number of full nodes. 
That's the reality that your "highly centralized group of developers" narrative denies.

Technically, when a LN node routes a payment, he actually only updates two channels with bitcoin that *he owns*. He doesn't transmit any bitcoins. So I would be surprised if they were considered money transmitters, but it remains an open question how jurisdictions will decide that matter. In my view, this question is not too important as LN will be Tor compatible.


In this simple example:
    YourAddress1 -&gt; Your SellerAddr + Your Address2 (change)
    YourAddress2 -&gt; KYC exchange
 
If law enforcement grabs Seller, you're busted.
There exists many independent implementations of LN and AFAIK there doesn't exist a unique specification. I expect a protocol specification will be produced in some months since interoperability between these implementations will be discussed during scalingbitcoin.

The other group believes Bitcoin's security is paramount and that it's safer to scale in layers. 
Both groups are aiming at mass adoption and share the same destination, but in different ways. The ones that are obsessed with some technical parameter and can't overcome this difference will whine and/or switch to altcoins and probably comeback when most users will use bitcoin without knowing what a blockchain is.

If fees hadn't increased, people wouldn't care about making more efficient txs. RBF doesn't kill 0-conf since it is opt-in and signaled to the network as replaceable txs. Once Lightning Network is implemented and widely used, I see no use cases for onchain 0-confs, but it doesn't really matter because I believe they will probably always be available (even if insecure).
@_date: 2016-09-22 12:25:33
Hitting the 1MB blocksize has been mostly beneficial to the ecosystem.
* it pushed inefficient users to become more efficient
* it brought us smart fees (when fees used to be dumb and static)
* it is bringing us more RBF wallets
The network is more efficient and more resilient (to spam attacks) than is was a year ago.
The more I think of it, the more I am comfortable with blocks being consistently full. The future of Bitcoin *blockchain* wallets is RBF and (automatic) bidding, in my opinion. Normal users won't be using directly the blockchain as we move forward towards Lightning.

Bitcoin is something difficult to grasp. And understanding how it works is especially difficult for non-technical people. So if you have the patience, don't hesitate to explain and over-explain how it works to the challenged people you will encounter.
I've personally lost patience, so I've stopped following self-important people like him and I now ignore stupid comments these people make. He doesn't matter anyways (he sold all of his bitcoins earlier this year or something) so we may just let him babble his non-sense.

A few public figures have tried to popularize this nonsense garbage narrative (Rick Falkvinge, Jeff Garzik, Gavin Andresen, Roger Ver, Linny Vin-something, self-important CEOs, ... ) despite many people spending time to correct them &amp; help them understand Bitcoin better.
My recommendation is to ignore these people. I personally decided to spend my time on Twitter more wisely, I only follow &amp; engage with thoughtful people and unfollow/mute at the first sign of stupidity. It's works wonders. 
As Bitcoin scales, you can't exhaust yourself engaging with every new idiot that gets on board.

No Bitcoin is not an orwellian nightmare. Let's not exaggerate. It certainly can and will improve its fungibility, but like everything in bitcoin, you need to be patient. 
For low to medium value txs : LN and TumbleBit will be amazing improvements. We are not far away from these.

You won't need to use any trusted third parties to use sidechains (functionaries are only a temporary hack). For the upper layers like lightning network, as far as I understood, you won't need to trust third-parties either. Moreover, Lightning is really new and we can expect major [improvements](

He doesn't even need to use a different coin, he can still use Bitcoin with a different implementation : NBitcoin (.Net), Bitcoin Knots (C++), libbitcoin (C++), btcd (in Go), BitcoinJS (JavaScript), Bcoin (JavaScript), and all the other ones that follow the Bitcoin consensus rules.
Talking about decentralization, how many Segwit2X implementations do we have ?? Oups...
Bitcoin Core is an open-source decentralized project that offers a convenient Schelling point for peer-review and testing (for example, if you have a team that reviews/tests 5 different implementations, it will be 5 times less efficient then if it tests a single implementation). People who try to tag Bitcoin Core as centralized misunderstand it, or are angry at the project for not implementing &amp; not merging unsound &amp; controversial requests (like Jeff garzik's SegWit2X or like Emin Gun Sirer's Bitcoin-NG).

1) **By starting to do politics**, backstage lobbying the ecosystem (using his position of "Chief Scientist" at the Bitcoin Foundation) and writing populist blog article, instead of addressing the dev mailing list, like any other dev would have done. This was very unhealthy because it incentivized other core devs to doing politics as a response, instead of coding and solving problems. It's a big waste of time for Bitcoin developments.
2) **By starting a software propagation war**, attempting to hard-fork Bitcoin in the face of [widespread technical criticism]( Bitcoin is not governed by users voting for the software they prefer. There is too much money at stake for a world reserve currency wannabe, and [miners understood that very well]( Bitcoin is and must be governed by consensus.
The actions of this developer were very unhealthy to Bitcoin. The community needs a peaceful environment to allow healthy discussions and agreements, it really doesn't need hard-fork threats and software propagation wars.

Your second image is not true and misleading because you confuse a group of persons and [implementations]( For example Satoshi:0.11.0 and Satoshi:0.10.2 are 2 different implementations. If you disagree with a change, then you can run any implementation prior that change.


Important changes can be rolled-out in a timely fashion if they are trivial and have major impacts. The important changes you seem to refer to are highly controversial, not trivial at all, and it is perfectly suited to take the time to discuss and think about it, rather than just rolling them over in a wink and say "Oups sorry, we fu** everything up"..

Yes I agree, smart fees and estimations have their limitations because they are vulnerable to spam attacks or "slow blocks" that miners take time to find.
Fortunately, Bitcoin Core supports *Opt-in RBF* that offers full protection against these nuisances by allowing you to dynamically increase your fee after you broadcasted your transaction.

@_date: 2016-10-20 17:03:22


Regarding opt-in RBF there was full consensus among the technical community. I believe 0 participants were against it. Moreover, if you disagree with it, nobody forces you to upgrade to support relaying RBF transactions : it is not a *consensus layer* change, it is a *p2p relay policy* change. Lastly, opt-in RBF doesn't even break 0-conf like you seem to assume (while full RBF would break it). But that doesn't change the fact that I can run a full RBF node, and you can do nothing to prevent me from doing that. On the other hand, if I mine 100BTC reward blocks and accept these blocks, I will be ignored by the bitcoin network. Understanding the difference between the *Consensus layer* and the *P2P relay policy* layer is critical.


I like Adam Back a lot but really he is completely powerless to introduce changes without technical merit. Same goes for Wladimir. If he tried to abuse his commit access to push a change into Bitcoin Core, it would immediately be reverted and his access would be revoked. And even if he somehow gained full control of the Bitcoin repository, there would be such an uproar in the community that nobody would upgrade to WladimirCoin.


Technical consensus is not reach through voting. It is reach through technical discussions between long time contributors. You can't just show up and start to veto. It has been already attempted before multiple times and it was immediately dismissed as an attempt to manufacture controversy.
You seem to think Bitcoin is existentially threatened by not changing. I think Bitcoin is existentially threaten by introducing undesirable changes. I guess it comes to the payment processor versus the store of value visions.

You seem to assume that Lightning Network is final and no improvements can be made. I believe that isn't true. Lightning Network is a new and immature tech, I think we can expect it to improve its scalability (so that channels almost never need to be closed), and we can also expect new layers to be invented on top of LN.

Interesting talk, Peter_R looked passionate about the topic. The only problem is that his conclusion has nothing to do with the content of his presentation.
How is a blocksize market equilibrium relevant to the blocksize issue ?? The blocksize issue is a security issue based on centralisation concerns, so the market equilibrium and production quota **gibberish is irrelevant**.
If in 2 years, the blocksize market equilibrium is 10GB (cf Phrenico post), Bitcoin will be doomed to censorship and single point of failures and Peter_R will be singing "But its market equilibrium hehehe!"

I think having many implementations means having to spread the review and testing multiple times. I don't think it is desirable security wise, but no one can prevent this from happening. I also prefer having a single technical community that takes decisions after thoughtful discussions and using a [consensus process]( like it is the case in most open-source projects and having miners and/or nodes deciding to upgrade or not upgrade as a sign of accepting or rejecting a change proposed by the technical community.

1. Zimbabwe dollar has utility as a payment system in Zimbabwe and has horrible value.
2. Gold is a ridiculously poor payment system and yet has huge value.
So maybe other properties of bitcoin gives it intrinsic value : censorship resistance, scarcity, protocol security (kudos to our core devs), costless &amp; trustless storage and the network effects &amp; ecosystem it benefits from.

In case it wasn't clear, I am being sarcastic. I think Bitcoin is ungovernable and that having any "project leader" is highly undesirable, especially in an open-source project where we need to attract the most valuable contributors that are free to work on what they want. Having a project leader also introduces a single point of failure and a target. Completely not necessary nor desirable.

I see it as an advantage. The only *changes* proposed to the community are the ones that make technical sense. No politics, only tech. Bitcoin is a protocol, not a product you sell. You don't design/maintain a protocol the same way you create a new product line.


Bitcoin is like that right now. If you and some buddies want to fork away, no one can stop you from doing that. What you can't do however is drag the whole community and force it to follow your change that you cherish. And I suspect that is the root of your complaint.


Direct democracy is what leads to binary choices, like chosing between two populist dummies, Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump. That is not the model I want for Bitcoin.


Influencing Bitcoin Core is extremely difficult without technical arguments, because this organisation was designed to be extremely difficult to influence (no leaders, consensus driven decisions, etc...).

Transactions will bid against each other with fees, to get included in a block.


This subject has been under heavy discussion since one and a half year. I will try to sum it up in a few sentences.
It would require a backwards incompatible change (risking the network to fork into two seperate currencies like ETH and ETC). It will put even more pressure on the validating full nodes' ressources. It's a real concern because full nodes keep dropping years after years since SPV waalets have been introduced. 
It directly threatens decentralisation. I suspect many people under-estimate how decentralisation is critically important to Bitcoin.

When you setup your PC you define a relative locktime (let's say 5 days).

Offchain transactions are not suited for high value payments. If you look at Lightning Network, it works great for micro txs and you can do an unlimited of them for no cost but LN doesn't work for mega txs, because the nodes that will route your payment need to have channels opened (in the right direction) larger than the routed amount.
The blockchain on the other hand is by designed very well suited for large payments. And mega txs will be willing to pay larger fees.
Offchain and onchain payments do not compete but rather complement each other.

I would like to see some more game theory around the assumption where we had a BU fork (let's say NewBitcoin) supported by 85 or 95% of the hashpower.
The OldBitcoin chain would still have 5% to 15% of the hashpower which means something like 1 block per 1 or 2 hours. If there is demand for "OldBitcoin", fees would surge (especially if RBF is more widely used) and this would incentivize miners to switch back to the OldBitcoin chain to collect huge fees. Investors don't give a shit about block time (I make 1 bitcoin transaction every 2 months on average).

I remember on bitcointalk, after auto-congratulating himself with a fake account, he forgot to logout and switched accounts and replied just like he was with his Peter_R account. That's how he got outed. If someone can dig that one out (archive search doesn't work for me on bitcointalk), it's important for people to know who this person really is and how sincere he is.

Well, it's a bit tricky to give a percentage for the valid fork and probably irrelevant. It's even tricky to me to give a precise definition of the "valid" fork. 
What if 10% of the nodes consider Bitcoin1 to be the valid fork, but those 10% are all of the exchanges, bitcoin banks/wallets, and block explorers, will Bitcoin2 become irrelevant ?
What if 5% of the nodes consider Bitcoin1 to be the valid fork, plus all of the investors believe Bitcoin1 to be valid one ? After a fork, all previous Bitcoin owners can in theory get both Bitcoin1 &amp; 2 so they can start selling all their Bitcoin2 coins and buy Bitcoin1 coins. And Bitcoin2 becomes worthless and miners may switch back to Bitcoin1 because it's more profitable to mine, even if Bitcoin2 had at some point a very clear majority.
It's tricky and that's why hard-forks make people nervous.

Your posts illustrate a major difference in vision between Core and XT. For XT, it is obvious that growth &amp; adoption is more important than security and survivability, while for Core it is the opposite.
Bitcoin as digital gold may not survive a huge security breach or censureship (because lost of confidence =&gt; lost of value), while Bitcoin as a payment method can very well survive both, it will just become a boring version of paypal.
What do you want Bitcoin to become and what should we prioritize ? Bitcoin today has no competitor as digital gold but very many powerful adversaries and it's also probably where the network effects are the most powerful : survivability is key. As a payment system, I am sorry but Bitcoin kinda sucks compared to physical cash, Visa or Venmo.
Let bitcoin be digital cash and let other payment protocol build on top to enable unlimited scalability. LN is just one of them and is only 8 months old. Don't assume everything has been invented : we can get the best out of the 2 worlds.

Don't speak for other users than yourself. No matter at what angle you look at the numbers, the economic majority is very clearly behind the Bitcoin Core vision : hashpower, full nodes (independant, not fake cloud services) or holders (bitcoinocracy).
Speaking for myself (I don't speak for others), I initially thought increasing the blocksize was a no-brainer, then I realized the reality was more complexe than it seemed and understood better what made Bitcoin so special to me. Now each day I am a little more convinced that increasing the blocksize is probably not necessary and even not desirable in a forseeable futur: changing Bitcoin's fundamental rules should be done only as a last resort and if it is technically sound, not because some teenagers want to play satoshiDice or some businesses need more capacity for the new Bitcoin casino they are launching (hi Roger).

Nah. Even if the "economic majority" (bitpay, circle, coinbase, ...) decides to run XT or bigger blocks, it will have 0 consequences as long as miners don't trigger the fork by mining 750 blocks from the last 1000.
I understand bigger blocks and MOAR transactions are important for their business model (hi conflict of interest?), anyhow they should spend their energy in bringing value to their customers rather than in block size politics.
@_date: 2015-11-30 19:20:22
Imagine the situation where :
* BIP101/XT is activated due to 75% threshold of hash power being reached.
* Investors decide to follow Bitcoin Core, sell their XTCoins to buy CoreCoins (for example if the technical community decides to stay on the Core branch)
* Price of CoreCoins increases relatively to XTCoins
* Miners are incentived to mine the most valuable branch and switch back to CoreCoin.
I am not saying this situation is likely to happen, but it is a possibility. At the end, [the branch with the most value wins]( which doesn't necessarily mean the branch with the most hashing power at activation time.

ASIC invested by miners represent a valuable Bitcoin asset that makes Bitcoin the most secure blockchain in the world, by very far. Google, AMS &amp; botnets are not close to being any threat to the network anymore. Resetting the PoW would make Bitcoin vulnerable to these threats again. Also, many people believe hitting the 16nm ASIC chips will slow down the race and make chips cheaper &amp; mining more decentralized in the future. We would need serious reasons to reset the PoW algorithm.

I read a lot of wishful thinking and not many facts to back all these claims.
Let's not do like the ostrich that buries its head in the sand to ignore a danger. Acknowledging a problem is the first step towards solving it, and Bitcoin's fungibility is certainly a concern that should be dealt with.
@_date: 2016-10-10 13:06:49
Covenants, the way it is proposed enables to give specific properties to bitcoins with unlimited depth. That's a big big change. The vault stuff sounds cool. But this proposal could also invite regulation, weaken even more Bitcoin's fungibility (when we are desperatly in the need of having a more fungible Bitcoin). And invite onchain non-financial use cases.
Overall it looks to me like their are more drawbacks than benefits, but it's certainly something worth examining and discussing. Implementing it on a sidechain is definately the way to go.
@_date: 2016-05-24 09:22:14
I definately agree it is a conversation we should be having even if I don't believe there is currently any serious justification to change PoW. 
You seem to believe that a PoW being ASIC resistant is a desirable property. Perhaps, but there is no consensus among the core devs on this very subject. ASIC friendly PoW protect from Botnets, supercomputers and AMZ/GOOG. Some even believe no PoW is known to be currently ASIC resistant.
A hybrid scheme involving an ASIC friendly PoW (such as SHA3/Kekkac) and an ASIC hostile PoW (Cuckoo) could be very interesting.
Bram Cohen is known to be working on a "Proof-of-Space" concept which relies exclusively on using disk space to solve puzzles. The more disk space you have, the harder the PoSpace problems you can solve. That could add an interesting dimension to a hybrid model.
@_date: 2016-05-14 15:22:08
Yeah miners can also be bribed, then they have a financial incentive to censor. 
remember that the financial system Bitcoin is attempting to supplant is extremely powerful and very rich. We are somewhat lucky we haven't faced yet a direct attack from it, but we certainly need to prepare for it the best way we can. We shouldn't expect the financial system to let Bitcoin eat its cake without fighting it with all its got.

People using bitcoin through centralized systems is not a big failure, and I believe there is absolutely a place for centralized systems in the bitcoin space. You would be surprised by the number of people who don't want to be in charge and want/need a helpdesk to help them out and make them feel comfortable.
Building centralized services or centralized protocols on top of Bitcoin is perfectly fine, and makes sense in some situations.
But what is really important is for the *protocol enforcers* (miners, nodes) to remain decentralized, because it's the only way to achieve censorship-resistance and survivability when we will be facing extremely powerful adversaries. If the Bitcoin's protocol enforcers are decentralized, their is nowhere to censure/attack Bitcoin.

"Our competitors" charge orders of magnitude higher fees than we do as moving gold bullions/bricks around the world is incredibly expensive. I don't even need to take this provoking example, buying plane tickets over the internet with VISA or MC still gives order of magnitude higher fees.
We simply don't have the same competitors. And guess what : I have more horrible news for you : "your competitors" are orders of magnitude faster than you and can scale with a dumb DB, while our competitors are order of magnitude slower than us (sending bricks around the world takes weeks).

Option 1 : Bitcoin has 1 billions users, using it for everything from morning coffees to evening beers. GB blocks. 
Number of full validating nodes : 5 datacenters
Blockchain transaction fees : 0.01 cents
Competitors : Paypal, VISA, Venmo, Square.
Adversaries : None.
Supply : dynamic and unforeseeable, coinbase signed by the World Central Bank.
Transaction processing : regulated through licencing of miners. Tx can be mined only if addresses have been registered at the World Central Bank.
Survivability : multiple points of failure : vulnerable to DDoS, censureship and lawmakers.
Option 2 : Bitcoin has 1 billions users, but only a small portion, let's say 10 millions, use blockchain transactions occasionally, mainly for saving value (outside national currencies &amp; centralized services) and for other specific use cases. 
Number of full validating nodes : 5000.
Blockchain transaction fees : 5$
Competitors : National currencies, gold.
Adversaries : Governements, national agencies, financial institutions.
Supply : Fixed. 21 millions.
Transaction processing: anonymous and censorship-resistant.
Survivability : no points of failure, resilient and censureship-resistant.

Yes, but that someone else is either willing to wait longer to have his tx confirmed (not in hurry), or he not willing to put a higher fee because his transaction wouldn't make sense with a higher fee (micro txs with micro-value and without any economical substance).
In the first case, no problem. For the second case, please keep in mind that blockchain consume network ressources and are certainly not suited for all of the world's micro-transactions. LN will be much more suited for these usecases. If we need to chose between protecting Bitcoin's health (decentralisation) and enabling every micro-tx in the world, I think we all agree that, the former is the best choice. Especially knowing that technology is coming to solve these specific problems.

1) The blockchain today is tamper-resistant because if someone attempts to change a confirmed block (by deleting a transaction for example), it immediately invalidates the rest of the chain.
It is not clear at all that a NG-blockchain still has this tamper-resistant property. From my understand, a miner can revisit the history and change the content of his microblocks without invalidating the rest of the blockchain, which is absolutely unacceptable.
2) It is unclear how the network reaches consensus regarding when exactly do the microblocks stop and when does the new key block begin.

Yes you are correct, blockchain transactions are absolutely not instant and people advertising otherwise are dishonest about the technology.
However, please note that Bitcoin will be enhanced in 6 monthes to 1 year and by then, transactions will be truly instant (also cheaper and more private). It won't be blockchain transactions but rather payment channel based transactions (Lightning Network).
So the best way to put it is Bitcoin is **not yet** instant.

Unfortunately, reading the whitepaper isn't enough, you need to understand its content. 
No, the longest chain (measured in difficulty) doesn't necessarily wins. The longest **valid** chain wins.
For example this is what prevents a majority of miners from creating 100 new BTC per blocks : if they do, their blocks will be considered invalid by other nodes and will be ignored. 
The blocksize limit is technically similar because it's a consensus rule : if the size of the block produced by a miner is above the limit, it is considered invalid by the other nodes.

Interesting presentation, but Christian presented a complexe design using absolute timelocks when today we know how to setup immortal channels with relative timelocks, thanks to CSV.
So I am wondering if Duplex Micropayment channels can take advantage of relative timelocks and make it superior to Lightning Network. 
I wished someone in the audience challenged Christian how his design compared to the Lightning Network. I haven't heard any strong argument besides "I like it better because this implementation seems simpler to me because I invented it" which is a rather weak argument in my opinion.

Cryptography is like magic.
Your *seed* enables you to reconstruct all of the addresses your wallet has generated, and you can do that from any computer.
That's why it's very important to note down your seed on a piece of paper and keep it to yourself (especially if not encrypted).
Edit : nothing is saved on their server, the wallet reconstruction is done locally on your computer (and can be done offline).

You can run a full node yourself (if you cared about Bitcoin you would be doing that already).

Bitcoin was meant to be neutral regarding criminal activities.
Now I read Bitfury about driving bad guys (sic) away from Bitcoin, introducing subjectivity, moral and politics in a place where all of these have absolutely nothing to do.
Approach endorsed by Gavin : not too much of a surprise to me, compatible with the XT red-listing temptation.
Notice also the presence of Jeff Garzik in this foundation, a core dev that was claiming that Bitcoin's core value is **censorship resistance** just a few weeks ago. Quite an amazing U-turn.
All of this leaves me rather puzzled. 
I suspect the community will start speaking about moving away from PoW if Bitcoin becomes effectively censored. 
We will have censorship proofs when seeing valid transactions with huge fees, stay in the mempool and not being confirmed.

The Lightning Network topology is speculative at this point, it is unknown how centralized it will be. A big LN hub needs to own a big amount of bitcoins and needs to take the risk of putting it online, which is difficult to secure. Moreover, there isn't any barrier of entry to becoming a LN hub. Anyone can join.
Let's assume the worst case: LN ends up being centralized with a dozen huge hubs : these hubs cannot steal any money, don't have any KYC infos (onion routing) and if one goes offline (DDoS, hack, government seizure, ...), their peers will settle onchain and the LN will gracefully deal with that node going out. Further more, LN is designed for small transactions, individual payment channels won't hold huge amounts of bitcoins.
LN centralization is much less of a concern then layer 1 centralization. Bitcoin Layer 1's security model relies on decentralization while LN's security model relies on Bitcoin blockchain layer 1.

I am 100% positive the community will succeed in increasing the block size.


Yes I fully agree with this.


No I am sorry you but that's incorrect. Neither 51% of nodes, nor 51% of the miners. 
Let me take a simple example: let's say a majority of miners activate 8MB blocks (by crossing the threshold), if 60% of the nodes accept 8MB blocks and 40% of the nodes stay with the 1MB blocks, then we have a fork and Bitcoin becomes 2 separate currencies, Bitcoin1MB and Bitcoin8MB.
At this point, "the network as a whole" doesn't mean anything, as it is 2 separate networks that reject each others blocks and 2 currencies with their own value.

Not the best analogy imo. Email took probably alot of USPS markets.
Bitcoin blockchain as a payment system offers nothing more than VISA. 
Speed: Bitcoin blockchain takes 10 minutes on average (1 hour to be secure) while VISA take 30 sec max. So Bitcoin blockchain is 20 to 120 times slower than VISA.
Convenience : VISA already has its infrastructure. Everyone in developed countries has a card and every merchant accepts it. Today paying in bitcoin is not convenient because you need to convert fiat to bitcoin before through an exchange. Seriously who wants to do that ? Further more if your smartphone is out of battery, you can't pay for anything : yay !
My point is that VISA/Mastercard out-competes Bitcoin the blockchain. People trying to promote Bitcoin as a payment system are fighting the wrong enemy. 
On the other hand, Bitcoin could be appealing to Bank of China who wants to diversify its USD reserve, for people in countries with much inflation or for people distrusting their banking system.

Very true, unfortunately many people have huge difficulties understanding this vision.
Bitcoin's value proposition is store of value and censorship-resistant value transfers : the blockchain by itself doesn't scale in a secure way. Payment methods that scale better can be created on top of the protocol, like lightning network or others.

Welcome ! Learning about Bitcoin takes a lot of time (took me 1 year to understand it) but it's definately worth it :)
SegWit is a major protocol upgrade, enabling new layers to be built on top of Bitcoin as well as significant bug fixes. We have been patiently waiting for it since more than one year, so we are very enthousiast.
Bitcoin doesn't have an authority or a leader that decides how to change it. It is decentralized. A group of developers called the "Core devs" contribute on the open-source project "Bitcoin Core" and evaluate change proposals based on their technical merit before submitting them to the community. Everything is done transparently on GitHub. If you are curious, you really see "How the sausage is made" (gmax).
Since 2015, there has been a few attempts by groups to take control of Bitcoin by convincing users and miners to run an incompatible software with different rules. These groups use populist tactics to convince others to run their software. All of these power grabs attempts have failed so far and if future ones are successful, it will only result in Bitcoin splitting in two incompatible currencies (hard-fork).

Regarding commit access revocation, it's a security measure. But that is really irrelevant. Commit access to the repository means nothing. It doesn't give special rights, it's not a priviledge, it's just convenient (fwiw Maxwell revoked his own key).

No problem with BCC, they are forking away from Bitcoin and acknowledging it.
SegWit2X is more of a problem, because they are forking away from Bitcoin but are attempting to steal its name, image and network effect. The result will end up pretty ugly: bitcoin.com and bitcoin.org with both support different chains, network effect will be split in two and consequently diminishing the value of both chains, Bitcoin will lose many invisible attributes such as its Lindy effect and its Schelling point.

It would be temporarly useless as a payment network. Once again, as a store of value, investors are not sensitive to block intervals nor fees : fees on the "slow chain" will consequently be much higher than on the SegWit2x chain : miners will make more money mining the slow chain even if the two chains have the same value : miners could switch back to the slow chain to make more money.
After the retarget period (which could last a few monthes) or after a PoW change, everything will back to normal anyways, that's why the burden is only temporary.

To be clear, let's call ether pre-fork ETH, and ether post fork : ETHF (forked) and ETHC (classic).
What I understand is that if you deposite ETHF on Coinbase and withdraw your ether, you may get ETHF and ETHC. Which means that Coinbase is responsible of severe negligence towards they customers : it will end up with Coinbase having to rebuy on the market the ETHC they owe their customers, with their own money (their investor's money), or depossessing their customers from their ETHC, which would end up with outrage and certainly law suits. 
What is surprising is that Coinbase has been favoring hardforks as a general "upgrade" mechanisms for Bitcoin &amp; Ethereum, in a very vocal way.

Also, many of the problems with ethereum hard fork would be very easy to migitate, for example having a version number included in transactions before signatures are applied, which would make all transactions in the fork invalid in the older chain, and vice versa.
Investors don't care about long confirmation times or high fees. Coffee buyers using micro-transactions have little impact in the valuation of a currency. My point is that investors can stay on the old chain with little discomfort. My last transaction was three month ago and I didn't care how much time it took to confirm.

Many privacy enhancing solutions depend on technology that is not yet implemented in the protocol.
For example :
* MAST (indistinguishable single/multi-address + less info leaked for multisigs) requires SegWit to be deployed
* signature aggregation requires Schnorr signatures, that itself requires SegWit.
* Confidential Transactions, doesn't seem to be ready yet as optimisations are still being worked on apparently.

Replay attacks are more difficult to pull in Bitcoin. Bitcoin uses UTXOs while the Etherea don't..
If a hardfork is controversial, planning long time ahead doesn't really matter anyways and won't change the outcome.


If a majority of miners with the support a significant part of investors hardforked unilaterally a change in rules, it would matter. The original chain would be insecure and very likely would have to change its PoW to live its life peacefully. I this context, valuation of both chains are highly speculative and depend on different parameters, like which chain is chosen by the technical community or by the industry to build new applications.
@_date: 2017-07-24 17:17:08
Not necessarily. For example a transaction on Legacy chain can spend outputs that are already spent on the 2x chain. Or a transaction can be broadcasted with a low fee on both chains, confirmed on 2x than fee bumped with RBF (replace-by-fee) on legacy chain. As chains diverge, more transactions will become incompatible on both chains.

The problem is that a large group of people actively denies the existence of scaling solutions that are being worked on by the technical community.
SegWit is a solution that fixes the problem in the short/medium term, before LN kicks in. SegWit is very elegant because it will increasing the blocksize by +70% or somethings, while solving a bunch of hard and long lasting technical problems. But the best part is that it will be deployed without disrupting the network, on an opt-in basis (avoiding an ETH like mess).

This kind of rhetoric reminds me of Gavin's "People joined under the assumption the block size limit would be raised, consequently we must raise it". Moving to Lamport signatures should be opt-in and there is no good excuse to force it upon people.

Yeah sure, but keep in mind Bitsquare's value proposition is that it is a *decentralized* exchange. How you build a decentralized reputation system is an open question that far exceeds the scope of the bitsquare project.

Many people (like you) have a very strong incentive to be strongly against privacy enhancements.
* law enforcement advocates : more privacy may render their laws unenforceable
* services that help track and deanonymize coins : more privacy is an existential threat to their business
* privacy-oriented-altcoin holders such as Dash or Monero : more privacy in Bitcoin makes their altcoin's value proposition less attractive

The creator "talking" about datacenters certainly doesn't prove he supported them 6 years ago and doesn't prove that he would support them today with the 6 year knowledge we gained. And once again : **we DON'T CARE**
The creator had no ways to predict the futur and how his invention would evolve.

Yes you are right, my opinions are my own and doesn't represent the opinion of Bitcoin Core. I also fully support the Bitcoin Core roadmap. I didn't mention anything about hardforks in my previous comment.


In this model you will always own your own private key. The blockchain will be your civil court. Multi-party channels are smart contracts. Anyways ... LN is just a new layer that itself can be improved. But also new layers can be invented on top of LN. That's what permissionless innovation is all about.
@_date: 2016-07-31 15:31:52
Hum ? $65 fees ? The transaction you are trying to create is 400 times bigger than a normal one. That is what is going on.
According to  tx fees are *at very most* 100 satoshis per byte, a normal tx costs between 10 to 15 cents.
@_date: 2017-07-24 14:40:52
1/ For each blocks mined, Miners earn :
* on SegWit2x chain : 12.5 SegWit2xCoins + X fees in Segwit2xCoins
* on Legacy chain : 12.5 LegacyCoins + Y fees in LegacyCoin
If :
* value of SegWit2x chain = value of Legacy chain AND
* Y &gt; X (which will be the case if the Legacy chain is slower) 
Then :
Mining Legacy chain is more profitable than mining SegWit2x chain.
2/ Yes, the Legacy chain will be vulnerable to 51% attacks. It doesn't mean it will happen, and if it does happen, a PoW will be inevitable and miners will not be able to switch back if SegWit2x blows up at some point in the future.
@_date: 2017-07-27 17:44:43
If SegWit2X succeeds, it will set a terrible precedent. It will mean that Bitcoin can be changed in the face of widespread controversy. Be sure that SegWit2X's next controversial changes will be over KYC (miners censoring unregistered transactions) and monetary policy. 
Meanwhile the true Bitcoin chain will continue to innovate with its vibrant technical community, bringing more efficiency, security and the more privacy we so desperately need.

Notice how LN has only been invented 1 and 1/2 years ago. And notice how today's LN design is much much better than the original one (immortal channels thanks to CSV). And I know Joseph Poon is working on improving even further LN's scalability by enabling people to share channels (multi-party channels).
You shouldn't under-estimate the people's capacity to innovate. I remember people screaming we needed X GB blocks to accomodate the world of humans before LN was invented. Now the same are screaming we need Y MB. Reality is that nobody knows what new invention the community will come up with, thus nobody know how much will be needed to accomodate the world's need.

Bitcoin is one currency. There is no current fork that spinned off (with existing common user base) that have gained any momentum. Ethereum on the other hand is now multiple currencies, and ethereum users now owns 2 coins. There is :
1) ETHF (ethereum that forked to bail out the DAO owners)
2) ETHC (classic that has decided to refuse the fork)
3) ETH (ethereum before the hardfork) (which gives the right to spend ETHF and ETHC)

Greenaddress supports RBF (the first wallet to support it I think): I've tested it and it works great. But it doesn't allow you to "double spend" your transaction because you can only replace the fee, not the receiving address.
@_date: 2016-07-31 13:02:17
What use-cases do you have in mind ?
@_date: 2016-07-31 15:34:32
It implements CPFP (Child Pays For Parent). If you are the *receiver* of bitcoins but the transaction is stuck because of too low fees, you can create a transaction that will pay for it. It's a great complement to RBF (Replace by Free) which enables the *sender* to bump the fee.
Also SegWit once deployed will enable Lightning Network, which will basically give instant, (almost?) free and scalable transactions.
@_date: 2016-07-24 07:22:55
Ideally privacy features would be added in Bitcoin's foundation layer and traceability introduced on upper layers as an opt-in feature for the ones who want it. I suspect that people who disagree with adding privacy to Bitcoin, are altcoin holders who don't want Bitcoin to eat their altcoin lunch. And there are pretty amazing privacy stuff in the pipeline (confidential txs, enhanced CoinJoin with Schnorr, MAST, encrypted txs, ...)
@_date: 2016-07-26 08:31:03
An increase will be proposed by Bitcoin Core to the network participants in the form of a change called Segregated Witness. Blocks will increase from 1MB to about 1.7MB (estimation after full deployment) up to maximum 4MB (extreme adversarial case).
The time frame is hard to predict, because the version containing SegWit needs to be finalized (still under test). Then miners need to support and activate this new change. Then wallets will need to implement &amp; deploy the change.
@_date: 2016-07-18 07:11:19
I'm not sure how cash would be compatible with Bitsquare's model, where the bitcoins are locked in a 2-3 multisig with an arbitrator for disputes. How do you prove you sent cash by mail or performed a cash in hand transaction ?

Non working network for who ? For latte users, yes perhaps. Investors are much less sensitive to block intervals, I personnally don't care when I withdraw / deposit bitcoins from an exchange if it takes 10 minutes or 10 hours to confirm.
Investors are very important because they are the ones who give value to a chain. Latte users are pretty much irrelevant: miners will mine the chain that offers them the most return, so they will follow investors.
The chain the investors will support remains an open question, not many people can claim they know the answer, mainly due to the Pareto power law (making polls irrelevant). But I also believe miners are not foolish enough to force such a situation. A fork where all sides claim to be the true Bitcoin would be very costly and damaging for the ecosystem, and miners would be the first actors to suffer from it. Especially if it is carried with a PoW change that ends up convincing investors. Miners would lose everything irreversibly, unlike investors, which makes me predict they are not willing to take such a risk.
@_date: 2016-07-27 07:13:44
It's very difficult to say, open-source developments can produce amazing software but respecting deadlines is not something they are good at. And that's okay, security &amp; quality is more important than arbitrary deadlines, especially in the context of Bitcoin. Then miners need to adopt it to activate the softfork. Then wallets need to adopt it to start producing SegWit transactions. My wild guesstimation is that we will start seeing the first SegWit tx on mainnet late 2016, early 2017.

We have already learned tremendously from the Etherea (plurial of Ethereum?) debacle.
* Bitcoin's limited scripting language (Forth kind) is intentional. Powerful scripting language widens immensily the attack surface.
* Testing new versions and looking constantly for new possible attack vectors is extremely important.
* (Eth) core devs intervention to bail out DAO users from errors that occured at the application level is highly controversial. Especially knowing these devs were heavily invested in the DAO (conflict of interest).
* Controversial hardforks result in the creation of 2 separate &amp; directely competing currencies. Plain and simple.
* Exchanges that decide to pick a side in the hardfork (according to their emotions in the case of Coinbase) lose [business opportunities]( create outrage in their customer user base and expose themselves to law suits.
**All of these points validate the careful and professional approach Bitcoin Core has been taking in software dev &amp; releases and also validates their aloofness with regards to hardforks as an upgrade mechanism.**
I think the community and Bitcoin Core deserve apologies from for his constant public harassment and attacks on these subjects.
