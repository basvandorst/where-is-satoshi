Thank you!

Well put. This is all new to me so I am slowly learning. But that makes sense, logically. Cryptocurrency can be a spooky place.

Thank you for this!

Thank You! Very helpful and very appreciative of your straight answer. The cryptocurrency may operate by different rules for all I know. Still getting my training wheels down.

Brother (or, sister. I am NOT gender assuming lol) I am fighting this to the core and I really appreciate you sending me these links. They are much more effective than a protest imo. I am still interested in the impact this will have on BC.

*face Palm! 
Yes I meant CoinBase! 
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:29:55
No, as in next month?
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:29:36
Damn. Can I borrow 100k?

Thanks! I've been and will be sitting on the computer until that time comes. It really sucks because this friend is really hard to get ahold of and we finally get time to sit down and go over everything and this happens.

I question it's sources

Uh, I had an awesome come back but deleted it on accident. I'll just re-type: semi-witty reply

Yeah, very true. But it's just funny how it worked out. We literally finally sat down to make a purchase so he could show me how to transfer to a couple of other less user friendly sites and bam! No sale for you! We went over the basics so I have my training wheels though. I have a cold beer and will just wait until we can buy again.

Damn it. So no infinity pool?
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:41:38
Awesome!

I don't understand how typing in caps will better help me understand what you are trying to convey. I still don't know what you mean. What search button? What sidebar? On Reddit? On bitcoin? On a mining rig? On the Reddit app? In Atlantis?
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:28:44
I am, but I have my financial reasons as well. Great answer tho!
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:56:39
I do have cheap electricity. Perfect. Thank you for your response. That's helpful. I'll look into the FAQ's and getting started.

Thank you for taking the time to reply and provide links and sources. I'm sure it has been asked numerous times. Even though I've had this account for years I have not been a very active Reddit user until recently. Even still, the app is somewhat different than the site I remember using. But anyways, much appreciated! I'm always looking for new opportunities. And I need to get reacustommed to navigating Reddit. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:32:38
Lmao! Literally lmao. Thanks for that!
