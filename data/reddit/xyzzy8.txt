I sold my LTC at $4 like 5 years ago. =\

RIP my HTHT stock... still upset about it

I bought my first bitcoin about a month after that tweet around $16.

*if* the price rises

I’ll buy in again when prices hit $16 which is when I bought them in 2011. I want my 640 bitcoin back.

Also Bitcoin is a famous collectible so for example I don’t think it’s possible for the market cap to go below $1 million.

Get the $420 memes ready again 
@_date: 2018-06-24 12:28:09
Is that also why it went up so high?

Switch to normal investments instead of cryptos

It's a game where they run back and forth and punt the ball and try not to score any touchdowns

I sold in 2015 and can confirm I'm butthurt.

Bitcoin is a device for transferring money from hodlers to manipulators

Unless you took out a loan to buy BTC. Then you are negative.

I sold all my Bitcoins at 280. I'm definitely not playing the game right.

All investments are imaginary money until they are liquidated. So the money never existed. If I invest $1 thousand to buy a fraction of a company at a $1 trillion valuation, it doesn’t mean I created a trillion dollars.

My portfolio got pushed back to December levels
@_date: 2018-04-04 23:30:37
Maybe I should set one at $280 which is when I unfortunately sold all my bitcoins.
@_date: 2018-04-04 23:31:49
Cheap for me is $16 when I originally bought Bitcoin in the year 2011.
