What came third? Honesty or change of moderation and rules?

The person that you are responding to is a Twatt. I’m not trying to advertise for Twatt’s, but I am trying to make a point that he is a Twatt.

Lol. Found the McDonalds manager

You’re absolutely correct! I switched arguments, because I saw commercials and they actually do look a little similar. I still refuse to believe that this mega company does anything that is an underhanded and shady as fuck. Also the food taste like shit. Also their big Macs taste like shit. Literally the only thing I’ll ever get from there is Mc chickens and chicken strips when they have them.

To assume that the super business has not replaced plenty of the beef with soy and water, and perhaps reduce quality and size of the buns and cheese would be arrogant and willfully ignorant. I attempted to use the slut Google to find answers for you, but I did not go much past the third link, and I only tried two search results. I’m gonna go make some homemade food now, because my quarter pound burgers at home are bigger more delicious cheaper and certainly healthier with true 93% beef.

Oh,did you hear google the other day when google said “we are not an end all solve all answer book.” And that their search results do not show up based on fact, but by popularity, and relevancy based on the specific words you chose. Also adds and paid placement. Sooooooooooooooo try a god a little less slutty next time. Oh and all of the foods have gotten smaller.
