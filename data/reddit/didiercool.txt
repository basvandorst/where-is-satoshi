I like the μBTC, or yu-bit (youbit?).  It's sounds nice in marketing, and heck, I have over 4 million of them!!  That also helps people realize they're still early adopters and the price seems low.  You can get 6176.65 Youbits for a dollar!

They told me they would 'continue to monitor it with interest'.

I didn't intend 'unfinished' to mean 'long.'  I absolutely agree that we should not limit ourselves to traditional ideas about books.  My experience with writers (via groups, publishing circles, etc) is that they invariably try to 'publish' pieces before they are rightly polished.  I would prefer to set this particular subreddit aside for writing that is ready to be read, if that makes sense.  The idea is to have a place that book enthusiasts could find interesting books to read without being bombarded by pleas to critique, by writing that is wrought with grammatical errors and incomplete thoughts.

Can't say for sure.  I asked myself the same question when they were $90 USD two weeks ago.  I'm glad I bought and if I had the expendable money I'd probably buy some now.  Hope that helps!

bitfloor.com.  Fill out deposit slip.  Copy info.  Drop money and info at nearest BofA.  You could probably even use your gift card (but no promises).

Think slow.  Don't freak out.  Plan for wide fluctuations. Don't panic.  Don't invest anything you can't afford to lose. And don't panic.

Bitcoin API allows you to write a script that looks for a death certificate for you and on finding it, the script will transfer your bitcoin to whoever you want.  There was a talk on here recently that addressed it.

The exchanges need to be on board for this to work.  The big ones at least.

Not real popular (yet), but you can get free books at and donate bitcoin to the authors via the tip bot.

Certainly laggy, but moderately usable.
Edit: Just went offline.

That's a fair point.  I used CoinBase to get started, but it's kind of a crapshoot now that your stuck with whatever price it ends up at when the purchase goes through.  Everyone seems to be recommending bitfloor these days but I haven't tried it yet and I'm not sure about bank fees (I don't think there are any to buy in, but I could be very wrong).  If I was buying now, that's the route I'd attempt first.  I'm not sure I want to be held accountable to a 'good starting amount.'  But I'd say however much you can do without if it all goes down the drain.  Best of luck!

A few months ago I made a subreddit, for this very purpose.  I never really publicized it and it didn't go anywhere, but I'm glad you're going ahead with the concept.  Seems like an awesome way to publish!  Good luck!

CampBX is just sitting there (almost) as stable as the last 48 hours.  Strange.

My understanding is that it depends on your speculative strategy.  If you move huge amounts of money to stimulate mad bear/bull rushes to profit from the swings that creates, I'd say it's bad.  However, if you simply post to buy and sell above and below the current market value, you're essentially providing 'guide rails' to the market which helps to stabilize it.  And that is very good.  That's my two Satoshis.

Back up now and downright snappy.  I don't it was DDOS, just a lot of frantic transactions.
