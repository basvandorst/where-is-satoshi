Ethnocentric analysis. 
The USD is utterly dependent on foreigners buying and holding not only cash, but treasuries. If the US has a ZIRP, and oil can be bought in other currencies, USD and treasuries will be sold. 
Currency collapse happens quickly. Like you say, they common people will be destroyed financially, while the smart money is safe in other currency, gold, or bitcoin.


I don't think you understand that when currency crises hit, *there is nothing on the shelves to re-price*. People lose their jobs, and the handful of products that can be bought, will be sold for anything that will be seen to hold its value.

The Fed had a ZIRP for years - 0-0.25% Fed funds rate. And the month-end settlements data still show about 0.1% even with a stated floor of 0.25%.


Russia sells oil in pipelines, not tankers. Tankers are increasingly used by hedge funds, buying tankers full of over production and parking them 10 miles of the Longbeach coast. There's pictures of them. Russian natural gas powers Europe, and increasingly powers China. While those can be attacked, a direct attack on another nuclear power is highly unlikely and has never happened. If it does all bets are off anyway.
ISIS was selling oil directly through a US ally, Turkey, for gold. Iran has been selling for gold for years. There are more multi-lateral energy deals signed every year to be traded in other than usd. It's not a question of when it starts, but when it reaches critical mass. 


No they can't, but they will simply not increase their reserves as they have been doing, and even decreasing their holdings by several $100 billion over the last 2 yrs. It's already happening, another question of critical mass, and timing in the next crisis, as there won't be the foreign purchasers there anymore to such up the debt. 


Sorry to do this man, but Greece wasn't a currency crisis. It was a financial crisis.  There is a huge difference. Debt isn't an issue in a currency crisis, because inflation doesn't matter. Venezuela has a currency crisis.

There are different types of demand. 
There's good old fashion demand, where people need to use bitcoin for forbidden or otherwise impossible transactions. This includes savings safe from confiscation, as well. This kind of demand is on the rise.
There's speculative demand, where people are buying to increase their purchasing power, and for that reason alone. That demand has somewhat declined, but could be argued as constant right now. 
Another type of demand is, ... I'll call it "on boarding demand", which is what you are seeing as decreasing. This is where noobs want to see what it's all about, get tipped, or buy a little, current users want to spread the good word, etc. It's more educational than speculative. This definitely has been declining for over a year in the US and Europe, but increasing in South America and China. Bitpay's new user numbers continue to grow month on month, and are concentrated in South America. Chinese are looking for more and more ways to get capital out of China, and they are finding bitcoin. 
So your worries can be eased. On the surface from a very narrow view point, it looks troubling. But when you learn a little more about the global market situation, it appears solid.

If the supply fails to produce the prescribed intent it is increased even more. But you are right, they don't understand their own policies, because that new supply goes into relatively illiquid investments, in an almost self preservation type play. This creates asset bubbles elsewhere, usually in things that are seen as money equivalents like real estate, art, even stocks and bonds. 
It remains though that it is over supply by design.

Yes, it could cause deflationary instability, but it won't even get that far. Proof of stake won't work for more than just that reason. One such reason as I understand it is staking decreases liquidity, so where you theoretically gain in efficiency, you lose in liquidity.

Please define "unpredictably".
Traditional money, or I think you mean currency, is always provided in excess. That is a central tenant of their scheme. They want inflation at 2-3%. They want a small amount of liquidity provided by people not wanting to hold the money, which they think stimulates the economy.
Commodity money supply is dictated by nature mostly, and relative price to a degree. It functions well over long periods of time because that supply is independent of human central planning and wishes. No matter how much a sovereign wants more gold, they have to dig it up. When luck strikes and more of the commodity is found, prices rise naturally, independent of certain groups' wishes or goals. Commodity money is predictable in its unpredictability, which is a state that this shared by everyone, no matter the office and levels the economic along field to an extent.

I hear that 1.2 billion used a lot, but how many of those active users are BS accounts? You can buy likes for super cheap from fake accounts. I'd say at *least* 10% of Facebook accounts are phony, and probably more like 20%. They are currently breaking off apps like messenger because they know the future is not the timeline.
How many gold transactions have taken place over the 7 years since 2009? And yet it has a $7 trillion market cap. Does the average person transact gold? 
There are fewer bitcoin users than Facebook users obviously, but to say that bitcoin is not a gigantic deal means you yourself are naive. Even at Davos this year, the gathering of the highest power players in banking, the topic dejour was specifically blockchains. If only $1 billion comes into bitcoin this year, the price will be bid up 1000s. Facebook lost 20% of its market value in the 2 months between Dec 15 to Jan 16. The market is fickle.
All of your claims are shallow and expose a misunderstanding of geopolitics and world markets. You'd probably have said bitcoin would never be more than $1 back in 2010. And you probably think a company only 5 years older than bitcoin, that being Facebook, is immune to failure.

Yes bitcoin == blockchain == proof of work. That's just a fact. Many don't realize this yet, and everything else is pure speculation and unproven. The Feds' and banks' blockchain concepts have already devolved into blockless datastreams, see R3's Corda. That will continue to devolve into encrypted databases, and not be blockchains at all, as they start to understand that blockchains can exist only when work secures it, as opposed to license or privilege.
If bitcoin failed today, all those blockchain efforts would fade into obscurity. Bitcoin will dominate cryptocurrencies, or none will survive. As for wide use, imo one day everyone will want bitcoin, it will be the defacto standard, but they will transact in niche coins for most things. Some medium sized decentralized coins, and some very small centralized coins. Every "blockchain" will keep track of bitcoin balances or equivalent balances, like the exchanges' databases today. Cheers.

Smart contract coins like the headline altcoin, doesn't even have a functioning multisig. I don't think bitcoin is falling behind there. In fact, Lightning uses smart contracts.
Also, medium of exchange doesn't equal means of payment. Gold was the medium of exchange during the gold standard, but people rarely if ever used gold coins as payment. They'd use banknotes or checks or whatever. Bitcoin has the most pairs on exchanges and the best store of value, meaning it is the defacto medium of exchange here, not because it's used in the most payments.
@_date: 2018-01-17 05:23:02
Bitcoin's lead is expanding, not contracting like the scam pumpers using market cap dominance tell you.
Bitcoin isn't competing for transaction speeds. That will happen on top. There's objectively almost no demand for payment transactions right now anyway, b/c we see little more than to-and-from-exchanges volume on faster altcoins. People don't just leave one standard money for another, they are chased or forced out. People aren't going to switch to a different coin because it's slightly better at one thing, more onchain txs.
Staying hard to change, decentralization, smart cryptographic scaling (that only the best devs in the world can create and they happen to work on bitcoin) are what are important and make bitcoin unique. 
There's only 21M bitcoins.

The Fed is owned by private banks. It's not owned by the government. It's private, with a relatively high level of regulation is all. 


I wouldn't call loading up on any and all risk, then bailing themselves out when things fall apart, with freshly minted money creative. How they cover up their scheme is creative I'll say that. But the scheme itself is pretty basic.
The banks would be able to make these toxic assets with bitcoin still, yes. But they wouldn't be riskless assets like they are now, due to the banks also being the mint. 
The reason there is no exodus to small banks is because of burden of regulation the big banks add to every year. There are also certain products that *only* the big banks can deal in. Being a primary dealer of treasuries is the main one here, which gives them a direct line to profit. They can afford to lower prices uncompetitively on other products which make smaller banks unable to compete, because they have access to a risk free treasury flipping market.

Protocols are sets of rules, both tcp ip and bitcoin work great. Bitcoin's rules haven't changed. Any expectations you've placed on bitcoin is your failure, not bitcoin's. The great thing about layered protocols is that they give maximum flexibility to scale, while providing maximum agreement at each layer. It's a competitive advantage against single layer scaling.

@_date: 2018-01-17 05:32:52
Think of it as a protocol suite. TCP/IP could be replaced by a more modern alternative, but it won't be, because it's too entrenched. Bitcoin as a layered suite of protocols for value might be too far ahead when lightning gets some usage to ever be challenged in this regard. Add to that the fact that it's also money, which has its own set of network effects and entrenchment. Bitcoin is extremely secure in its position.

I guess I'd consider that buying something with bitcoin, not cashing out. But that's a good plan. The Rothchilds said buy when there is blood in the streets. So there should be some good bargains within a couple years after the huge collapse coming in financial markets. 
@_date: 2015-12-16 20:31:25
That's a great insight. The recent spike in price was met with huge hash power increases. I haven't studied it, but I'd believe that this increase was much quicker than in the past. Therefore, that is a stabilizing factor on price that differs from the 2013 bubble. As price spikes and avg block time goes down, more supply is created and (possibly) delivered to the market daily, which would temper the price movements up.

There are other interesting developments in this area already. I recently heard about OKCC mining that prioritizes transactions for their customers. They have about 5% of total hashing power I think. You use their service and guarantee free transactions, though you might have to wait a few hours for confirmation. But for certain applications that should be OK, like asset settlement or whatever. There might also be services that contract with all pools for certain transactions to be confirmed for free. Pay 0.001 a month and get unlimited confirmations or something. Anyway, it's an interesting space. 
@_date: 2015-12-15 18:14:45
Cash out to what? Hopefully you won't need to "cash out" after another couple of years for anything.
@_date: 2015-12-11 03:02:14
That's basically my hypothesis too, but it's interesting we didn't see a hash rate spike at the end of October. Was it too fast and caught miners off guard? And secondly, do you think the hash rate gives support of the price, not just the other way round?
@_date: 2015-12-17 20:49:56
Change in hash rate vs change in price would be interesting. 
@_date: 2015-12-11 15:49:28


But does hash rate support price was the question, not lead price. Perhaps hash rate can be viewed as a temporary representation of marginal cost. I understand that over time marginal cost decreases at a constant hash rate due to technology advances, but in the short term, say a few months, the hash rate could be a proxy for marginal cost. 
It is a fact that hash rate is stickier than price. Meaning that the change in hash rate lags the change in price. However, Satoshi wrote that in the long term the value of bitcoin would equal the marginal cost, or the the point where the Marginal Cost equaled the Marginal Revenue. 
I'm also fairly certain that miners are heavy in the futures markets, hedging their operations and production. As you probably know, futures were originally designed to hedge future production and insure investment in the capital means of production in other industries (particularly farming). So the hash rate could be priced in, in futures and not directly in the sale of fresh coins on the market. Futures would give miners the needed time to adjust their hash rate (or marginal cost).
Anyway, valuable discussion.

Fungibility in bitcoin is less an issue than fungibility in other currencies because it's so secure and its use not tied to domestic politics or geopolitics. 
"Illicit" is such a subjective term anyway. There are some people in the world who consider govts taking a person's money that they earned selling drugs illicit. Some people were very upset that there were bids on the Silk Road coins, because they viewed it as dealing in illicit money. It all depends who is defining the term. Best of all, Bitcoin doesn't care at all about that, it responds to real market forces. 
What I great experiment we have here. Will the market come up with a solution to help stop stolen coins from being used? Or the opposite? My money is on the opposite.

If what you claim is true, why are there no private companies offering services to protect businesses and individuals? One great thing about bitcoin is that even if they were gained "illicitly", a person somewhere down the chain from that "illicit" activity doesn't really care. No one can take them from you. They eventually will be spent.


Whenever I deposit cash, the teller takes the bills and puts them in a drawer. I don't see her scan it, or put it through a counter that scans it. It goes into the pot with the other cash. They don't really care. Unless you are depositing $10k+ it's not an issue. 
Exchanges will have to comply with legislation and regulation, true, but how they do that will be a cost benefit analysis. Perhaps it'll be a terms and conditions thing where to use the exchange you attest to the cleanness of your coins. Idk. But what's clear is that if there is net benefit for people to check their coins, they will. But I doubt that'll be a "serious problem".

Valuable conversation, ty.


If that is the case, then why do we see massive spikes in the hash rate with a $100 up move, but not a corresponding decrease in hash rate with a $100 dollar decrease? 
As the price goes up, hash rate increases as you say, they dial it up. This causes blocks to be found by up to 25% faster (in the past week or two for example). It isn't a negligible affect either. 3600x25% is 900 extra coins. That causes more supply to hit the market everyday, and has a tempering affect on the price increase, which in turn can help avoid bubbles and their corresponding collapses. As the price falls, miners can dial it back (which remains to be seen in observations), and cause lower than average inflation and support the price.
These are short term effects obviously, as there are difficulty adjustments. But it shows a more complex relationship than you say "price*TX fee volume" with no mention of the much larger block reward or sophisticated hedging options, or impending halvening. 
@_date: 2015-12-06 18:21:35
The bitcoin economy is evolving at lightening speed. Just a couple years ago, your experience was common. Today you have trusted third party escrow built into services. I think in the near future banks will be relegated to that role. There will be competition for escrow agents. Watch out for regulation of escrow agents btw. 
Also in the near future we'll have automated escrow agents (smart contracts). These smart contracts will be more expensive because you'll need to put up more than the amount to incentivize good behavior, ie double the amount. Of course, that creates a market for escrow insurance, or escrow loans, import /export escrow amounts, etc. By the time regulators are regulating escrow agents, smart contracts will be here, and they will begin chasing escrow insurers. In other words, they will be a step behind. 
Adoption has come in waves, and will continue that way. The next wave could be very small countries having btc as part of their national reserves which has been floated by some countries (and the IMF) already; supply would be drawn out of the market and price goes up; attracting more people and countries.
@_date: 2015-12-11 16:01:17
I tend to agree with you that difficulty affects the price, but not only current buying (bitcoin's for immediate delivery) effects the price, or that it happens through small individual mining. 
At relative tops in price miners can hedge their production in futures. These futures would be at a discount to the market price at tops in the market, and have a negative effect on prices immediately but a supportive effect if the price drops below the strike price because it opens the market to arbitrage. And the opposite at bottoms. While the hash rate is not exactly cost it is a good proxy for marginal cost I  the short term.

I'm using "cracked" (vs hacked) to denote malicious hacking, not the encryption "cracked". The biggest weaknesses are the 51% attack, malleability and consensus. While bitcoin has shown high resistance to the 51% vector, not only in shear hashing power but also in the incentives that a high price gives, altcoins have shown weakness, and if they compete with bitcoin they invite malicious actors that have a vested interest in bitcoin. 
See cryptocurrencies are different from national currencies because they can be cracked. Someone can't just crack into JP Morgan and destroy the dollar. But they can crack feathercoin or auroracoin, etc with multiple attack vectors.
Regarding your comment that the miners will switch to a different coin, I think the idea of a number of miners switching to attack an altcoin is more likely. A miner attack market might even be created. Who knows? As you say, we are in the nascent stages. I could be wrong, but the advantage goes to the creative, not the naysayer.

You said it yourself, yet you are so quick to dismiss others. 


It's been 7 years and hasn't happened. Does that mean it won't? No. It does mean it's growing more unlikely to happen, at least in the near term. Bitcoin was birthed in relative anonymity, in the general absence of previous blockchain technology experience. Today, new coins are released into an a fully geared up attack from day one. Bitcoin has evolved a counter measure to competing altcoins in addition to network effects, the awareness by malicious actors. Any altcoin that had a chance of being competitive would likely be cracked. 
It also is arguable whether miners would jump ship to another coin, and when that would happen. We don't have a lot of empirical evidence. The XT fiasco is related, and we didn't see mass exodus of miners. It was and is still seen as a benefit to have larger blocks, yet when given a choice miners chose to stay in a complicated game theoretical play of reporting they were using XT but staying on core. The consensus measure broke down. The price dropped from $320 to $180, too, forecasting doom. That appears to show that miners will stick to a sinking ship as it were, and to be competitive an altcoin would need to build a network from the ground up (as we've seen so far). 
Edit: it's been 7 years this Jan.

So altcoins or side chains or open transaction pools. 
@_date: 2015-12-10 17:11:12
That's the idea. However, with the current block size limit, the exact details are unclear, because there is a limit of about 3-4 transactions per second. Fee markets will have to emerge to deal with this obvious market need, but that remains unclear. The block size limit may change as well, we just don't know now. 
One of the things that excites me personally about bitcoin is that it has these types of questions that no one has ever been able to live through before, in real time. We are seeing economic theory play out right before our eyes. Bitcoin will evolve in 10 years time, what took the old world 1000s of years to figure out. It's an exciting time for sure. 
@_date: 2015-12-09 21:57:02
A very small one, but it's voluntary and you can disable fees on most wallets from what I understand. Usually it's between 0.0001 and 0.001 btc so 4 to 40 cents at today's price. It's the same no matter the size the transaction. So you can send $1mil worth of btc and still only pay 4 cents to ensure quick confirmation. 
@_date: 2015-12-11 01:05:29
Other options include: 
1) Sell something for bitcoin. Offer services for bitcoin online, or look for work online. There are several sites for this around bitcoin, one is coinality.io.
2) Ask an employer to pay you in bitcoin, see bitwage.co.
Hope that helps.

An interesting aspect to consider in the move, is the affect on other currencies, and how that might create flows into bitcoin. The Yuan devaluation recently has shown high inverse correlation to the bitcoin price, if this Fed move causes further weakness in the yuan, we could see a big jump in btc price. 
@_date: 2015-12-05 17:27:30
Thanks for that explanation. I recently thought that this might be a transaction priority scheme, like BTCC mining scheme. Transactions made with apps on the 21 computer will have priority when the 21pool mines a block. They'll not charge a fee for their txns, but will for others.

True FRNs has been benefited from flight to safety in the past, but it won't always be that way. When FRNs are seen as riskier than bitcoin price will explode.
The Fed tries to make the FRN more risky than other assets, hence the inflation target of 2%. In their mind, they are incentivizing spending, because the FRN will be less attractive to hold compared to other things. They want to make FRNs riskier, they will succeed.

Very good point. Crazy there are so many dynamics; miners can slow down, or withhold their coins from the market temporarily, or dump their coins into a parabolic move. I mean they have to plan and have strategies in place for these things right? Interesting area to study.

You brought up central hierarchies as a benefit for consumers in support of Visa, not me.

It's not a coincidence that they can control those two in a centralized hierarchy and restrict access and competition. Just look at the battle between CurrenC and Apple Pay right now.

There isn't really any institutional money in bitcoin yet ($5 bil market cap), so if the collapse happened very soon, bitcoin would be generally unaffected by deleveraging. If a collapse happens at the end of 2015 or later, then deleveraging could be a problem, since more institutional money should be in the space by then. However, by that time many may see bitcoin similar to cash. Bitcoin's independent rails for payment will be very attractive to people fleeing the collapse.
How would a financial collapse affect miners is a big part of the equation as well. Who knows?

If your goal is simply adoption, yes, push an organization that can freeze and seize your coin. If a healthy, long lasting economy is your goal, coinbase is not the answer.
In the case of gbtc, I'd say most volume is not from individuals themselves but from managers. They can't very well say "take your money out of the account I manage for you, (that I take 1% or more a year) and buy bitcoin." They want to keep that money in the investor's account so they get their cut, while getting expose to an exciting new industry.

You probably realize that currently malicious actors can create a single huge transaction that bog down the network. What happens when someone makes a 10mb transaction that takes a day to validate? Some things need to be fixed first.
4 years? A LOT will happen in 4 years. Minering will be sold as a service, where pools will offer subscriptions to get your txns confirmed with no fees. Miners will be forced to compete on how many txns they can put in a block. Large companies will have started using payment channels along with mining as a service outfits. These large payment channels will include txns of the type described above, that are crypto intensive.
Large companies will have mining rigs delivered (like bitfury is doing), and will offer services to their employees as a benefit.

Semantics here, but intrinsic value is value aside from monetary value, not speculative value in this case. 2 separate things. Monetary value is present value, where speculative value is obviously in the future.
Something used as money can have material value, monetary value, and speculative/hedging value. Which is inherent/"Intrinsic" is unclear. They all arise from natural characteristics.
The OP was trying to point to the information as the source of value. Hard to say. Information is power, and that's definitely intrinsically valuable.

The business models around mining will definitely evolve. We can't even predict what they'll look like in 10 years, let alone 100.
Mining as a service is one I've been thinking about. Think of a large miner with 5% of the network. They'd have a subscription model to include your txns in one of their blocks. Maybe they'd sell 5 txns a day for some monthly fee.
Mining is currently going through a vertical integration phase, where companies are controlling everything from making chips to running server farms. In the future we could see more horizontal models. Pool analysis will be a growth industry, along with ASICS manufacturing. There's lots of room for specialization and growth. 
It's truly only limited by your imagination.

Not a very strict definition of open source mind you, but if the governance of classic is not transparent (like was brought up above), and governance is the topic du jour, one could say they are not being as transparent as they could be. Wouldn't they want to publish everything and have every decision, every process, every poll open and transparent? Why and how they came to every decision for example would be good to be able to look at transcripts. Decisions made behind closed doors is hard to accept for the rightfully skeptical amongst us. 
You might say, 'bitcoin doesn't do it this way.' But bitcoin works right now. A hard fork risks $billions and is taken at least as seriously by the community as they take their local city council meetings, and those have minutes and often transcripts of meetings.

Blocks can only remain full if user's behavior doesn't change. So is it a "fee event" or a steady state or both (or neither)?

Bitcoin's ideological concepts are a result of the code that works. If the code resulted in different concepts / incentives it wouldn't work. In fact, many have tried to build something like bitcoin in the past and they didn't succeed anywhere near as well as bitcoin already has.


Most people don't understand anything about money, and would accept anything that works. They wouldn't know what they are agreeing with or opposing, only that some forms of currency come with strings.
And whose to say that bitcoin / cryptocurrency technology won't evolve to encompass all those features that people find useful?

So, I'm trying to follow your confusing (and unique) logic here. Correct me where you think I'm dense: Classic is either Bitcoin, meaning it's been activated at 75%, or it's... nothing? It currently has 0% consensus on the network, so what, that's not definable? Maybe vaporware? What would you call it if you had to name it right now? It's not bitcoin, and you said it's not a fork yet, and it's not an alt. So what is it? If core would be an alt at &lt;25% consensus then Classic is... Not an alt at &lt;25%? Maybe it's a wannabe future alt? Or a chain coup project? :) 
See where you could be wrong? You might have a better chance of convincing someone if you didn't come across as mean. Classic is an altcoin project with aspirations of becoming bitcoin imo.

Depends. The market right now has the option to choose among blocksizes, it can pump an alt that has a bigger blocksize. The market thus far has chosen bitcoin, which has a 1mb blocksize. That doesn't mean the free market chose bitcoin because of the blocksize, but if it's a determining factor or characteristic, there are options available. 
We don't know specifically how the free market will decide in a hypothetical situation. We can say that within that hypothetical situation, the market will eventually make a better choice than a council of experts. But to compare the current council's decision making, with a future hypothetical state of the free market's decision making, and then to predict specific differences is impossible.
@_date: 2016-03-18 19:07:10
My understanding is, someone please correct me if I'm wrong, colored coins are bitcoins that represent the asset (could be only one satoshi). If your wallet has zero bitcoins in it, it can't contain any colored coins. 
However, counterparty assets are not dependent on the bitcoins to exist, bitcoin only serves as a medium of transfer. Therefore, they need to tag along with bitcoin to move ownership, but a counterparty asset can exist in a wallet with a zero balance. You can have a wallet with no bitcoin, only assets, and sign with that wallet's key to prove you own those assets. In the future, you can have one big HD wallet with all your digital assets, and not have to tie up your bitcoin. There is no need to tie up bitcoins as assets.
That might seem trivial, so here is another difference. Colored coins must be sent to a color coins enabled wallet. If they are sent to a wallet that isn't compatible, the colored coins disappear forever. That could be a huge deal with assets that have a large value, like maybe a reputation coin, or a coin connected to a smart contract. Counterparty assets are persistent, and can be recovered if you sweep the private key to a counterparty compatible wallet. Backup your privkey and you backup your assets.

I think I do understand, all projections about the future including Mr Garzik's "Fee Event" are subjective and theoretical. Forecasted negative outcomes of those predictions are also unknowable at this time. Using fear inducing words like "fee event" instead of "market forces" which is exactly what he's describing, exposes a bias. It exposes a mistrust in the free market. Stability and consistency are of utmost concern when letting the free market function, which it can do in the most inhospitable situations. 


Subjective, and doesn't consider the equally likely risks of political upheaval and precedent set by hard forking. Chooses an politically expedient solution over long term risk mitigation. 


Subjective, and fear baiting with no empirical evidence. The block cap has been hit in the past, and we are still able to have this discussion. Empirical evidence is against the fee event idea. I'm not saying that it's impossible, I'm saying that current evidence and opinion don't support the idea as of yet. 


Agreed. But a hard fork is a certainty if certain actions take place, where a fee event is theoretical and counter to empirical evidence and opinion up to this point. Therefore, negative effects of a hard fork are of more immediate concern. 


No. Classic will be a child/fork. Bitcoin can't be a child of itself. I believe that the market will quickly resolve any secession by choosing a winner. That is the most peaceful and polite way to solve this. Let classic fork, if it has the support it claims, the matter will be resolved quickly with the defection of "most miners, most users, most merchants". If it doesn't, the matter will be resolved quickly the other way. Delaying the fork seems to me to show uncertainty, and erodes support. BTW, I don't think merchants will decide to go with a fork of bitcoin and neither will miners without meetings, planning, months of coordination, test runs, ddos insurance, etc etc. By that time, since the ecosystem moves so quickly, the issues with bitcoin will be passed and we can move along together. (of course I don't think we move along together, because I believe the whole fork issue is political in the first place).


It is up to them. I've been in bitcoin a while now, but I still feel like I have the opportunity to get out, or buy altcoins, whatever. Nothing is tying anyone to bitcoin. People can vote with their feet. The system is set for right now. It was this way when everyone got involved in bitcoin (except some of the core devs). You and/or the hard fork proponents have the right to do what you want though, still to this day. But they don't have the right to tell other how to act, they must use persuasion and the free market for that. 
At the bottom of this whole affair is the coveting of power. The forks want the power bitcoin has. They want the power to enforce their rules, their version of democracy, their vision of the future. It's quite an ugly reality that this is all about control, imo. All political. 


It commonly builds mistrust when an argument states a belief as a fact.
Boy this is getting long, sorry dude. But you made good points and showed effort in you response, so I wanted to show the same respect for your arguments. :) 


On the contrary, Bitcoin devs are not "doing nothing", they have created what we have today, they are also working very hard to make those responsible changes we all want, but have to deal with these constant threats by forks. Again, I think it'd be better to just fork, get it over with, let the chips fall where they may. By dragging it out, the forks are actually creating the very situation they oppose. You can't change something by not changing something, that's blatantly false. They can exacerbate issues through inaction, but they can't create changes through inaction. That's the other side or nature that is creating the change. 
Make sense?

I think the "next rally" started in Oct. Bitcoin has a lot of new financial tools when compared to Nov 2013, like futures and margin everywhere. These tools will keep the rally more orderly and spread out, resulting in a general bull market instead of crazy moon shots and crashes. 
The Oct spike to 500 is what we can expect in the future imo. 2x price moves with 4 months or so consolidation. That gives traders the space to get liquidated on shorts, and then trapped into longs. The days of 30x parabolas (like 2011) are over.

There is a difference between having doubts and casting doubt. One is natural, while the other is malicious. 


That's subjective obviously, but valid. Perhaps the question was worded poorly in their opinion. We all have subjective opinions. Their views on the blocksize are well documented aren't they? Have you read the Samson Mow post about how the internals of the core team work? Core is very disorganized, and I think it's understandable that individuals would not want to be taken as speaking for the whole group of disparate developers. 


I was unclear, sorry about that. By "they" I meant many classic supporting reddit usernames who have openly collaborated in plans to block segwit. And the community voice is supposedly of utmost importance there.


That's a good hope. But being "too late" and "damaging" are very vague concerns. Do you have any specific concerns, like what kind of damage? Long term hodlers (like since 2012) have been through these ups and downs, times of confidence and times of doubt. Everytime bitcoin's open-source and distributed nature aligns incentives properly. This phase of doubts is nothing new. It's hard to predict the future, without knowing the past. History shows that it'll most likely be OK. 


We have a pretty good idea though right? The average number of txns and wallets is still going up, so most likely very few. Volumes on exchanges is up, too. It would be more of a stretch to say a lot of people have dropped.
@_date: 2016-03-22 00:52:49

Still today, opposing devs and influential people are very cordial toward each other, while the community channels are vitriolic. It feels as if there might be provocateurs of some sort around.

I agree that the Fed does it wrong if that's what you are saying. However, I as a user actually have the responsibility, not the experts in this scenario. (Of course, I'd assume that the experts are also users.) 
The responsibility of the user doesn't involve taking any part in a decision that effects another user directly. Each user is independent and can make decisions for themselves. That's how we got into this fiat mess in the first place, trying to let people vote themselves into a better outcome. Slowly, over time, that breaks down. 
The responsibility of the user isn't rule through a vote, it's deciding what's right for them personally and then acting on that individually. Anything more than that is over stepping your responsibility. If it's too risky, sell and wait. That risk is absolutely needed to affect proper decision making on the part of every user, miner or plain. 
The core devs' job is a weighty one. Yes, they are in a privileged position, but it's part of the system we chose to enter, and we can all make decisions based on the fact that that is the way it is, weighing risk and reward accordingly. We can better anticipate the outcome with these experts than with the mob. It's a voluntary system, we all came in freely, and we can all leave if we want. But we shouldn't force our personal decisions on anyone else.

I appreciate your real world experience, and I believe that people have told you that. However, there is a problem with using human beings' reports as evidence in forming a position. It generally cannot prove anything. People might not fully grasp the subject, they might be toeing the company line, they might be ignorant to higher up's strategy and opinions and speak only to their own personal opinions, placating the questioner, they could be lying, or blinded by a superiority complex, they are fallible in other words. 
Resistance to an idea evolves. Bitcoin has been met with ridicule from bankers and hedge fund managers in the past, that is certain. For the most recent example, Jamie Dimon's curt comment about bitcoin (to paraphrase, 'bitcoin won't be allowed to succeed') with a laugh.
As it has become more clear to bankers that bitcoin is a tour de force, they have chosen to "adapt it" to their uses. You can see that obviously in all the blockchain stuff. They still separate themselves from "bitcoin".
The bitcoin community isn't paranoid for no good reason. Numerous parallels can be drawn from empirical evidence, which don't rely on fallible human beings. E-gold and the Liberty Dollar are stark reminders of the lack of indifference by authorities. It can even be argued that political leaders of nation states have been removed from power and worse, because they had designs on replacing the dollar or to stop using the dollar for certain reasons. Additionally, crowd funding raised money for companies that use solid encryption to protect their customers have been frozen and stolen by banks and payment processors (see proton mail). And finally, Apple is in a fight with governments over encryption that limits the govt's control of their customers' data. 
The empirical evidence points to govts/banks will fight losing control. That's not media driven, or circular logic from a biased forum, that's historical evidence. Unless you think 'it's different this time', even though bitcoin embodies a larger threat to their control than all those things combined?
Financial professionals' opinions of bitcoin, while accepting and neutral on the surface now, can change quickly when their jobs are being replaced, or the value of their life savings is in jeopardy.

Another way to approach this argument is to say brute force wins over flexibility. Which might be true on a battle basis, but the war will be won by the more flexible. Foundations for technology are better built on flexible and extensible software. More innovation will happen, and the inflexible side will drive people to innovate even more on the flexible side. 
So the very short term this might be true, but in the long term it's false.

On the protocol level? No. 
As a third party service? Probably. 
Adding too many things to the core protocol causes problems and stalemates like we see now in bitcoin. Keeping as much as possible outside the protocol is probably more sustainable in the long run. 
To proponents that say identity is a must, I say there should be market forces in that direction. There are already many project out there doing this, so use them. Govt or large companies could require use of things like onename from their customers very easily. In fact, this is probably a very large future market where companies will compete to provide services. But by adding it to the protocol level you insulate innovation in this area from market forces.

Right now, within crypto you have several options. 
1) Go long ETH/BTC. Etherium is catching on with news like Microsoft support via Azure and R3 support via... whatever they are calling their chain hybrid thing. Beware, Gavin has left the project for now and their whole developer community has been cast to the winds. It could be an epic pump and dump, but it seems to be the only competitor with a potential to continue if bitcoin dies. 
2) Shorting bitcoin. There are multiple exchanges where you can take a short position, which profits as the price goes down. Margin trading can be risky though, because you can quickly get in trouble if the price moves against you. 
3) Selling a futures contract. A put contract is one where someone will buy your bitcoin from you at some point in the future for a set price (longest I've seen is quarterly settlement dates in bitcoin).
You should checkout the BitcoinMarkets sub.

Once again, no definition. You'd agree you don't know what a blockchain is then right?


Yes, intranets don't need to be open, but then of course they can't compete for value transfer then. Why would someone need a token that has a limited use v a token that can be used permissionless worldwide. 
It's a weird idea that a system that only allows byzantine generals in by default can be BFT. You (and intranet chains) have a LOT of evidence to produce. The jury technically is out, but if you are in the real world you should default to what is currently provable, and private blockchains can't exist in the wild. They are more inefficient and less secure than what is in use today.

Good points. I'd add to this centralization of power production. In the future if we get cheap solar going, we can decentralize power production. 
All the centralized externalities play a big role. Centralized power production, centralized chip manufacturing, centralized regulation, all these things add a centralizing force to mining. Solar, 3d printing, and laissez-faire policies would go a long way. Frankly, as long as those things are relatively centralized mining will be relatively centralized as well.

Changing the rules of bitcoin is not the way. I for one, am building applications that require being on a full node and having access to bitcoind. Those apps could provide much of the functionality of the bitcoin 1.0 companies, and offer a platform for decentralized apps coming next. That's how we could incentivize full nodes, by giving them some benefit or value that they can't get otherwise.

Miners are not a separate class. Anyone can be a miner, and any miner can stop mining tomorrow. Incentives are identical for all participants in the network.
The full node has the same incentive to be honest as the miner, and as the individual with an SPV buying something online. They have different decisions to make which are uniquely affected by the singular incentive structure, but the incentive structure itself doesn't change depending on a class. I think you might mean, the miner has a direct *'opportunity'* to steal coins.

I mentioned not being a business owner because there are general challenges everyday that call for creative solutions, which he seems unable to come up with. Are you disagreeing with that? 
I explicitly said that people don't yet know what the solutions will look like. I was just throwing out a few ideas.
More specifically to your points:


Anytime someone uses the word "greed" instead of "self-interest" or some other neutral term it shows they are socialists, and have a deep misunderstanding of the free market. But maybe I'm wrong, and you just used that term by accident. 
Tricks or not, bitcoin is flexible exactly due to it being designed to enable decentralization. It's not "perfect" decentralization ( 7.4 billion mining full nodes), but it's decentralized to the point where it works. See decentralization is inefficient. A network made up of people/nodes (rational or irrational) will tend toward the most efficiency, unless other barriers are put in their way. That means that networks will tend to get more centralized even bitcoin. The magic of bitcoin is that it has the ability to move in the other direction as well, out of the way of those barriers, by becoming more decentralized when needed. 
Saying "re-centralized" as an end state makes your thinking rigid and seemingly unable to think of a networks' level of centralization as a fluid variable, which can change to maximize efficiency, redundancy, and security, like bitcoin. 
This line of reasoning can be summed up as, bitcoin is as decentralized as it needs to be, and can change if it needs to change. That can't be refuted at this point, because it is currently working. 


Really? Can you please link me to a service I can use? 


No one switches off. Why do you, because it takes some effort and original thought? There are some well documented issues yes, but most developers working on bitcoin are generally positive on the idea. 


Huh? If 20 countries were competing on providing the most mining friendly situations,  it would likely increase decentralization. But then, as I said above, bitcoin wouldn't necessarily need that. It might still tend toward centralization if the market valued efficiency over redundancy, and function just fine. Another idea is, perhaps isp's will compete for mining and guarantee protection against government subpoenas/actions etc, in exchange for a small share of profits. Who knows. Got any ideas? It's only limited by your imagination. 


Funny, is being a speculator supposed to be bad? What do you want me to do put code in here? Or maybe I used the wrong buzzwords and should have used "greed" and "sneaky tricks". You seem disconnected with any technical/economic understanding yourself and are negative in general without any supporting logic.

As long as there are no guns or cages involved, the free market should be able to take care of this. 
I remain generally bullish on bitcoin, and I think the core devs have proven themselves up to this point and I personally am comfortable with their stewardship.

Your ad hominems mean you've lost the argument. This all started with me asking for you definition of blockchains, which you didn't do. It's OK. Those people you cite can't either most likely. 
Blockchains are an public distributed ledger of hashes secured by PoW. It lives in the wild and is byzantine fault tolerant. It is more inefficient by degrees than centralized databases that do the exact same job. The only reason to make a blockchain instead of the technically superior centralized databases, is to be public, censorship resistant, and provide fungible value. To do that, you must add PoW. Linq is not a blockchain. 
A private database that uses hashes, blocks, and tokenization are not blockchains, because they are not BFT, are censorable, and don't use PoW. Banks and financial organizations like Nasdaq see some of the *effects* of blockchains, like immutability and transparency, which they falsely think are *causes* of the benefits of blockchains. They are mixing cause and effect. By giving their centralized database system some of the same characteristics of blockchains, they claim it's a blockchain, but it's not. 
Now, your turn. Or you can flail with more ad hominems.

Hence Classic is the chain? I know that's nitpicky but see how you could be seen as confusing issues here? 


Now Bitcoin = all compatible nodes/clients. (note: they are not completely compatible, meaning they are incompatible) You even say "they", not 'it'. If they were the same you'd say 'it', right? They are not ==, yet you say they are both the same thing. See why I can't follow? Would be better to say NONE ARE Bitcoin. But let's talk about reality.
Your definitions might seem illogical to me because they ignore my main question, regarding reality right now. Right now, this moment in time, what would you call Classic? Not after it starts getting implemented by nodes, not after it gets 75%, right now, before it gets 1%, before a single block is mined by a node running classic? That is actually reality is it not? It can't be simply bitcoin or there would be no need for the adjective 'Classic'. Separate repos, separate names, etc etc. Just because it can talk to other nodes doesn't mean all clients are "Bitcoin", it has different DNA. I guess you could call it an incompatible minority client relative to the reference client (it an altcoin)? Parts are compatible sure, but not in total. I mean right now, this moment in time, it's vaperware right? It's proposed end state is not compatible with the current reality right now. 
OK, so (Classic != Bitcoin). So we need to step back. If it's not Bitcoin, and it has parts that are incompatible with the reality of the network right now, but it is a cryptocurrency client, what can it be? Oh man, it's an altcoin.

Comparing blockchains to tcp/ip is incorrect. The blockchain IS the token, the token IS the blockchain. You cannot have a blockchain without an incentive structure to promote good behavior, ie a valuable token. To alter your analogy to fit, you have to reinvent a unique tcp/ip for every blockchain/token combo. So blockchain + token = tcp/ip. Domains would be layers on top of that protocol. 
It is more likely that bitcoin's tcp/ip (blockchain/token) will be adapted to serve other tokens, while itself remains the lowest cryptocurrency protocol layer. This is due to the difficulty in bootstrapping an open network that is as universal and valuable at bitcoin's. 
Closed mesh network blockchains could happen and are interesting, but they'd use bitcoin as the value token to trade within their system imo. A restricted mesh token cannot have more value than the cost to attack the small network. Also, if you ever wanted to trade outside your mesh network, you'd have to use bitcoin, so it would be very inefficient to use anything other than bitcoin internally. Unless there was some large overriding value or valuable product only accessible inside the network.

If any crypto were to take bitcoin's place, it will take years after bitcoin collapses. Could take over a decade for something as successful as bitcoin to emerge from the resulting cloud of doubt and misunderstanding.
I think a long term viable alternative must come from a time after mass adoption, and it would have value burned into it. If bitcoin collapses before mass adoption, it'll be years for another to takes its place.

If there was a lot of support out there, like claimed very loudly, they'd have 5k classic nodes and they'd be secure from ddos. 
700 classic nodes and 3.5% of blocks sounds a lot more pathetic than 1500 nodes, and 70% of miners (give options to use classic). It's all just a PR/marketing game. The false claims of support followed by 50% aws mining is very shady.

I think there is an element of resistance by bitcoin in principle of rushing to action induced by fear (which is very wise in most cases). On the other side, I think there is a distinct perception that the hard fork projects out there are peddling that fear to bring about a fundamental changes to bitcoin (which rightfully causes skepticism). 
Many in the community also appear to be suspicious of governance changes inherent with these new hard forks. The existing model and parties assuredly aren't perfect, but we know it has worked up to this point and has proven methodical and secure from political threats. New governance models and people, open bitcoin up to possible existential threats.

No. You used an appeal to authority by citing Gavin as "proof" of your opinion. If you have evidence to add about the negative consequences of a fee event, please share it. Just saying it will be bad 10 times over and over again doesn't persuade or prove anything. Or saying you know, or you are "perfectly capable".
I have read Garzik's paper about this. Basically, it has no analysis of why a fee event would occur, it only says "realistic projection". The then goes on to say how different users would react to it, without explaining his "projection". 
Maxing blocks up to this point hasn't resulted in any horrible effects, that's empirical evidence to use in a hypothesis, yet there is nothing there or from you. I think at least a well reasoned argument of disaster is necessary. If you are "perfectly capable" then explain why a FE is likely. Else it's FUD.

It depends on the timeframe. If a billion people come in tomorrow, then no we can't avoid over crowding and fee related problems. If it's a billion people over the next year? Then yes, maybe we could avoid fee related problems. I mean, this wouldnt happen in a vacuum. If that many people had a reason to come into bitcoin in a relatively short amount of time, it'd be for a reason, the price would explode, we'd have a much accelerated roadmap, and they would be coming into bitcoin for a reason. Higher fees wouldn't matter as much in that case either.

I think the important thing to understand is,  minus the Hearnia, the price has been recovering nicely from the parabolic move to 500. In fact, if you take the 24 hours after his announcement out of the charts, we'd be right at ~500 (420 + 75 of the hearnia).
Up to the halvening, we should see one more pump in price. I personally think 500 or 600 by halvening. After that likely up, but who knows. We could consolidate at 500 until deflation sets in.

The lightning network is basically a new type of bitcoin transaction, one that stays open like a bar tab. Many small txns can go back and forth, but they aren't settled until the very end. The whole time, both parties in the lightning transaction are in control and can sever the connection, which settles at the current state of the transaction. It is best for small regular type transactions, and has some trouble with larger amounts, due to the btc having to be locked in that txn until settled. Hope that answers your question.

I never said that and don't believe that to be true. You misunderstood me. I just meant that price in a free market is a sum total of all available information. That information includes everything explicit or implicit. Perhaps people losing confidence, people fearing never ending forks, etc etc. Price is the ultimate arbitrator. 
I'd like to add here, that the belief that miners have all the power is false when you understand the power of free market pricing. If people disagree with the miners either way, they can sell their bitcoin (on which ever chain they want). For example, if you support core, and there's a disagreeable fork, sell all your coins on the fork. If everyone sells on the fork, the price of the forked classic or xt coins plummets and core's bitcoins will be worth more, and probably result in miners that have left (if any) coming back to core. Economic warfare.

That's exactly what it means. I agree. How fast a given amount of data can be processed through the network. Throughput needs a time variable or its worthless. You can adjust the time or the amount of data. Segwit does a lot, but one thing is it speeds up validation of multiple signatures right? So it's faster/more efficient/higher throughput.

Try out as much beta or even alpha software as you can, and give plain language feedback. You can also brainstorm or collect data about pain points in the economy, either generally or specifically in one industry, that could be helped with bitcoin and share your findings. Also, taking informal/formal surveys in the market place about what people want and share it.

Interesting logo. I think more than a new logo for the currency we need a new logo for the network as a whole. Bitcoin transactions being used to transfer digital asset or use in smart contracts are much more than currency. I think a currency logo is confusing. Maybe a logo for the currency and a logo for the network could be separate? Branding the idea of the extensible protocol and network is important and a logo should relate that somehow, but I'd leave the currency logo as is for now.

Yes. It's pure speculation, an educated guess. I mean it's the future we are talking about here, so no one can say for certain either way, success or failure. But if we are to measure right now, the fact is their current numbers are less than 2000 movers in 15 years. I know they just hit their goal of pledges, but 15 years is a long time to sit around and wait. If those early, say 5000, signers were going to move they probably would have already. 
The FSP movers are worse off now freedom wise than they were 15 years ago, because the Federal govt has grown. No 20k movers can change that. There's nowhere to hide in the US. 
But yes, it's speculation. We'll have to see. Btw, I heard Panama is very nice, and has had 10s of thousands of movers in that same time. Oh, and it doesn't have a central bank.

But users all will hold value in bitcoin. You'll use xcoin for something and ycoin for something else. But you won't want to hold value on the less secure chain when you can hold it on bitcoin's blockchain. Maybe you'll leave 5% of your money there but not much more. 
There won't be a gradual shift from one dominant coin to another. As long as bitcoin is around it'll be the dominant/most secure coin. There can be niche coins, like 1-5% of bitcoin's market cap (there can be bubbles in this regard of course). Only when bitcoin truly fails down to ~$0 will a new coin be able to overcome the network effect and store of value potential of bitcoin.

The issue is not blocksize, it's security and the continued existence of this experiment. The Core devs are in the long term, blocksize agnostic, and are looking at ways to serve the needs of the network, not cave to minority FUD.
Sometimes solutions are leaps in understanding, discovered by a sole person working alone for several months. We are at the bleeding edge of technology here, and solutions might not be known yet. But to jump to conclusions and brute force a possibly wrong decision would be silly. 
I'd propose another middle ground, how about the minority forks out there contribute to core in good faith? Follow the BIP process for changes, add to the conversation calmly, and understand that major changes take time and that their proposal might take a year or more to be accepted.

Good point. And users have the ultimate power in simply selling their bitcoin to voice displeasure. That would upset the miners' delicate balance of profitability.

What, so pool users that weren't pointing at classic all of a sudden will switch? Votes don't matter at all in bitcoin. It's as if you want mob rule or something. 
An article from bitcoin.com, an above average classic supporting site btw. I couldn't get passed the intro paragraph (quoted just below) before my suspicions were confirmed. Only a few of their users will even vote. Lol. Here's the link 


Or a direct link to the results maybe.  Voting started 2.5 days ago, over a weekend, and 6.6% have voted for classic. What evidence to you have that it'll end differently? Any actual evidence? 
There is no public outcry amongst miners, small or large, or amongst users, r/Bitcoin has 10x the number of subscribers as other subs. It's just not a big deal to 90% of the community, sorry. They might care about the blocksize, but classic was over before it got started. 
What's strange is people running 700 nodes on aws for... No reason other than reporting for classic. They can't mine. Oh, but wait, the node count will look good, and maybe get other inexperienced miners to join the little movement. /s

Interesting, I have some questions if you wouldn't mind considering them. 
Is the economic majority of one mind? Is it always certain and discreet in its opinions? Can its opinions be discovered from a whipsawing price, or a flat price? Does it interact with anything else, or is it purely an abstraction that you came up with?

In my limited exposure to the FSP, I know two people that signed up that don't plan to move there. I'd assume it's about 50% of signers are even considering it. And out of that only another half will actually move. Especially with all the infighting happening within the project right now. 
I say it died, because there model is broken. Back when the FSP was started, in 2001 prior to 911, prior to Snowden, two Ron Paul election experiences, the 2008 crisis, and bitcoin, it was a solid idea in the eyes of libertarians. Now however, an enclave of people inside the US is just not attractive, especially when much nicer foreign ports beckon. I wish them luck, but anti-bitcoin regulation is the final nail in the coffin imo.

This is the first time I've read their weekly analysis. Cool. 


This is such a key and insightful point. Why are they focusing on China? Looking for a scapegoat perhaps? The Fed has no bullets left, and will need an excuse to explain their rates flip-flop and unprecedented printing to come, all to save any credibility possible. The colossal mismanagement and collapse of the China Miracle is just such a convenient scapegoat. 
Bitcoin's monetary policy will be a beautiful juxtaposition to the Fed's this year. The bitcoin economy will be steady or growing while it's undergoing a restriction in new money (halvening). Talk will begin in earnest about managing national monetary policy with an algorithm. Just some predictions ;).

Idk. I'd speculate that he might have sensed the activity as astroturf and reacted. There must be more knowledge of the suspicious activity in certain circles because they are approached by powerful people of other industries or are more sensitive to it. Again idk, I tried to stay out of it at the time, so didn't read much of the discussion then.
It's interesting to look at the whole time as an immune system response of sorts. Involuntary and focused. But then again I'm a believer in social swarm intelligence. Foreign actors enter and some people play the role of t-cells. Bitcoin is very secure from a work perspective and on those attack vectors, which one could compare to blunt force trauma. But bitcoin is still vulnerable to bacterial and viral infections, which one could compare to social infiltration. OK I'll stop there.

I know you mean to spread your opinion on the inadequacy of the network. And now I know you can't take any level of pushback or debate about your claims. 
Huge new projects, like a national system, could use the same off chain system exchanges use, right now. As new developments happen it will become even easier. 
@_date: 2016-03-08 03:37:01


As in several months, not "another year". How much development do you think can be safely done in several months?
Are you saying you aren't concerned with scaling or security right now, only throughput? Are people wrong if they are more concerned with those things than throughput? Do you think it's advisable to have a fairly major soft fork happen immediately after a messy hard fork, while the dust is still settling? 


It all depends on your definition of good enough. Does it mean no testing, some, 3 major bugs, 2 consensus failures, 1 rollback? What's the "good enough" definition, and how do you stop it from being not good enough, while riding fast and loose? Why not get it right, passing the tests in development and on testnet, it's only a few months? 
@_date: 2016-03-21 17:15:34
Everything else equal, maybe. Marginal classic supporters will find it difficult to support an anti-scaling position. Could be a huge death knell for Classic if they oppose. That's the problem with movements built on marketing. The handful of opposition accounts on reddit will be in full FUD mode and have to sell the idea that scaling is not scaling, and that the way you scale is more important. That's exactly opposite to what they've been preaching. 
Core supporters could also spin their hash rate up to bring it to 95%.

Depends on your risk tolerance. Alts are more risky than bitcoin. And if bitcoin failed, they'd probably tank too, in the short term at least. You gain little from diversification for risk mitigation, but for speculation is a different story. If you are going to speculate, do your due diligence and don't hold trades for too long.

This is debatable at best, false at worst. Segwit, which is on testnet already, contradicts your point today, and who knows about the next 6 months.

Either you didn't listen to Glenn Hitchens or you didn't understand what he was saying.
He made it very clear that the copper thing was an analogy. An analogy to better introduce what bitcoin is to people broadly. He says that email buttons still have envelopes, even though it has nothing to do with traditional mail, because people can relate to it in the physical world. 
I understood it to mean that the bitcoin B with the currency bars through it, that resembles the USD symbol, is the wrong analogy. In front of regulators as they were as well, it's probably safer to refer to it as a commodity like copper rather than the more highly regulated currency. 
@_date: 2016-01-24 21:42:25
No, I think that is wrong (if I understand what you are saying). The market conveys different information to every participant. A large investor in New York and a miner in Iceland, have different information than business owner in Argentina, due to all their individual circumstances. The sum total of this information is the price. Of course the price can be different in different places (represented well by price differences between exchanges, OTC markets, and futures markets).
We can see the sentiment of the market by watching the price. Of course, it's not a perfect science, because the total number of variables that all the market participants are weighing is nearly infinite. That is the magic of prices in a free market, they are the best way to sum all the subjective value judgements in the market.
If the information available in the market was leading users to evaluate the situation as more risky, the price goes down. If the outlook is positive, or weighted more toward  a less risky evaluation the price goes up. As an "event" approaches the price will adjust in real time if the market liquidity allows that (which it does in bitcoin). You can even look at futures values, to see the currently sum total outlook of a time in the future. Imo a fork is more risky, and therefore you'd expect the price to decline into a fork event. 
The term "economic consensus" is meaningless beyond the more simple and powerful term "price". There can be no economic consensus outside of the price, and the price will track any consensus opinion forming in the market real time.
@_date: 2016-01-20 14:15:54
Good point, but they'd also benefit the most from bitcoin then because of their complicated network of transactions that take place throughout their system.

Acid + commit authority + statesman type responsibility = danger. They are on duty 24/7, there's no days off. Perhaps they were unprepared for the overwhelming responsibility they seek. 
But let's vote on consider.it for the Toomim's continued involvement with classic. Or how about vote for consider.it to be banned from the classic process. Or even vote if reps of Classic should use pot and acid. 
They should just fork and call it classic coin, then use any third party product or substance they want.

That sounds bad, but it's just random facts put together to tell a story and evoke emotion. 'People' might be getting nervous, but most users aren't.

The issue is that bitcoin shouldn't rely on some third party voting system. Is it open source? Is it secure? What's the backup, unilateral? Too many questions. A step of this magnitude would require a year at least of development and testing. 
It's all a joke anyway, a guerilla marketing campaign for their struggling product. They aren't serious, or they'd abstain from taking acid and going on a public messaging platform and making a fool of themselves.

I don't think they'll outlaw it per se. I think they'll demonize it, and make people feel stupid if they like it. If they outlaw it, it then becomes cool, and they kind of admit they are worried about it. They'll just harass people and make example out of a few. Imo.

What do you expect, 10 million new users over night? (I think Brian Armstrong just got excited.) Maybe we'll see a couple million new users a month enter bitcoin over several months, spreading out those txns over weeks not hours.
Current users will be hodling too. People always discount changes in current user behavior in this scenario. If I was going to buy something on purse.io with $20 of btc, but bitcoin is mooning, I'll use usd instead. That kind of thing will open up existing space on the blockchain for the newbs.

In the future, if people are transacting billions over the network each day, with some transaction being worth $100 mil or more, they probably will voluntarily pay a higher than market rate fee, just to make sure it goes through quickly. A $50 fee on a $million transaction isn't out of the realm of possibility.
If we trade different assets over the network, a transaction might only move a dust amount of bitcoin, but be very valuable, and they might just pay a large fee. 
So your equations will have to adjust for that. Specifically, different levels of fees for different transaction types. I'd say it would be roughly a % of the total value of assets which used the blockchain that day, which will be larger than the strict currency market cap.

That is probably close to reality, I'll grant that. But then users have several options, 1) sell your bitcoin, 2) try to forcefully take over the network, 3) fork and continue, or 4) patiently and rationally work with the core devs to make changes. That's the way of the world. It's not weak to sell, or fork, or reason. The only think that shows weakness of mind is number 2, trying to take over the network by force and social pressure through FUD, manipulation, and threats. My favorites are 3 and 4, of which 4 is the best option. 
@_date: 2016-01-17 23:32:53
I appreciate the civil discussion. 


In my eyes at least, I don't think in terms of being ok or not. Coming from a game theory perspective, classic v segwit are separate questions. Should bitcoin incorporate a change that is not compatible with the current network? Yes or no. Next question is can it do so. It's a wholly different exercise to ask whether bitcoin should incorporate a soft fork to add features.


I see that too, but I think it's more a political fight over the ability to make that very determination. Currently, certain individuals are custodians of that ability and the forks want that ability to be transfered/changed. Plain and simple in my mind. If that's the case, would it not be more peaceful to not have the civil war? Fork/secede and exist separately. Don't fight for commit access on the existing repos, existing websites, or existing social media platforms. Peace is a much sought after effect of the bitcoin project. Let's have a peaceful secession, instead of a civil war.

@_date: 2016-01-21 16:41:56
Craig Grant, well done. 
Imo price action will be spastic and be correlated to 'events' in the market. On the long side, utility and adoption will spread in spurts, as news and new implementations hit the markets there will be moon shots in price. 
On the short side, the banks and govts will work behind the scenes to cause negative 'events' causing sharp declines. They'll be in 3 broad categories. 
1) They can't openly attack bitcoin, especially as their system has been in a depression for 8 years, and pointing out flaws in bitcoin directly is the 'pot calling the kettle black'. They'll subtly cause FUD like with the Hearn episode. In fact, that event along with the forks are probably going to serve as templates for further FUD.
2) spread fear in the community and amongst businesses through the courts.
3) increase compliance burdens. 
The lukewarm treatment of bitcoin by banks (and by extension govts) will begin to turn unfriendly this year. But the price will continue up none the less.

There are two parts to your question. There is the network bitcoin and the repo bitcoin. The repo must have a small team with commit access. We can't give permissions to everyone. The network is controlled by the miners. The miners have vested interest in making users happy. There might be some value in a service that translates English content to Chinese or other languages.

The future of bitcoin? I'm also very bullish, too, and believe it's sound. Over the next year, govt's relatively warm reaction to bitcoin will turn hostile (speaking from a US perspecitve). We ain't seen nothing yet. 
Imo, as bitcoin refuses to die, they will come for us, with their media and their courts. Bitcoin will be more and more demonized, while they tout the superiority of the tech and a fundamental need to free it from the evil bitcoin. They will demand more and more compliance from bitcoin companies and make sure they have them begging at their table. IRS might come after bitcoin investors. The major media stories will be about criminals using bitcoin, and what a hard time bitcoin is having as it slowly dies. Possible headline, 'blockchain tech has been held back by bitcoin for too long'. All lies, but they don't care, their goal is to keep bitcoin adoption low and control people's perceptions. 
Other countries won't be as organized against bitcoin, like Latin American countries or Africa, but western countries will be locked down. 
This will last until war or economic collapse takes their attention away, which is the end game of the legacy economic system.
Is that too doom and gloom?

Larger blocks can be filled by miners sending transactions to themselves. Larger blocks propagate more slowly, giving the last winner a small advantage. If 50% of blocks are found by two pools, then they have a noticeable advantage and it leads to more centralization.

You are wrong. Any smaller chain using the same algorithm will be attacked. There is zero chance of survival for a 24% minority fork on sha256 past a couple days.
This actually make hard forks harder imo, because any split would tend toward 50% not 75%.

There are some things that alts have that could be added to bitcoin as a separate protocol layer (the now common "on top of bitcoin"), not merged. The alt explosion of 2013-2014 will mutate into a meta-protocol boom in 2016-2017. These things will depend on the bitcoin blockchain, but be wholely separate. Like Counterparty. 
Some alts have great niche potential, but it'll take a while for everyone to realize they aren't replacements for bitcoin, but rather edge infrastructure.

Interesting analogy. But bitcoin is more like a river, for large container ships moving cargo, not a road. 
Right now, the river is clogged by tiny row boats. The LN is the road where the tiny traffic should be, which would allow for better technology both in ship design but also in car design. 
To increase the capacity of the river would take a monumental total community effort versus, building roads which are individual or small scale projects that don't need total community involvement.

Under the scenario of 90% activation, those are the 'assumed' facts. I'll agree to that. 
Miners can't trust other miners, that is why there is all this emphasis on getting public confirmation agreement, so on and so forth. There is an advantage to having more information than your competition. They can say they will switch, but they might not. There is nothing binding them to a decision either way. Secrets will be kept, and higher level collusion will take place. It's naive to think it won't. If one of those secret agreements involves just 11% of the mining power they can cause pandemonium, by not switching to the fork. Miners that switched expecting 90% will switch back, and it'll be over. Expecting people in several countries, and 1000's of stakeholders, to act in their competitors' best interest is quite simply wrong imo.

Thank you. I agree that market forces dictate outcomes, but I'm still not clear on your economic majority distinction, as separate from a minority, or the market as a whole. 
I view the market as not being made up of concrete groups, as you put it "users" and "miners". It's more of a spectrum than that, I think. And their set of subjective values are not binary either. I've mined in the past, and may mine again, for a variety of reasons separate from purely economic (political, ideological, practical). I don't spend bitcoins everyday, and I may not even be hodling any bitcoins at all, but I would still consider myself a user. Miners are also users, and actually power users when it comes to the primary price mechanisms of the exchanges or OTC (p2p) markets. 
The "economic majority", while I agree in the idea, seems to be a different name for the market in general. There is nothing that is distinguishing them from an economic minority in other words. It is all one big market. The way in which each solitary user chooses to signal their values to the market, which aren't binary, sums to the over all market's forces (which are constantly in flux and real-time). The individual subjective values are invisible, generally speaking. In other words we have no way of grouping users by their values, because their values aren't binary and are ever changing. We can see the sum in prices, but have no way of designating them into groups. You can't, not be in the majority. It's just the market. 
Therefore, isn't it just over complicating/politicizing things to bring in the idea of majority v minority? Cheers.

If you are right, doesn't that make you question the reason for all this disagreement? It's not about blocksize, it's about politics. Bitcoin is in a delicate position threatened on many sides by incumbents. Can you imagine if Hearn was given control of bitcoin like xt wanted? Or to two immature (imo) brothers who have never lead any project of even medium size, have zero experience, and who's true motives are unknown? 


No it's not. The idea is that it won't be in a few years, there will be 75% fork attempts every month or two, in a relentless onslaught.

Yes, there is a thing that measures all of this information in the market without artificial regulation or abstraction, and is right in front of all our faces. It's the price.
There is a big unequal distribution in bitcoin. I'm interested in seeing which exchanges will allow trading in both forks. I for one will be selling my fork coins immediately, and use that money to buy bitcoins. I think the major holders (which I am not one) will choose in the end, not the miners. I mean, the miners are dependent on the price. 
Edit: betting on the spreads and ratios like fork/btc will be interesting as well, and pretty sure that will be provided somewhere.

Coinbase is a bad example, they only trade btc. Other more important exchanges trade alt coins, and the fork and bitcoin will be just like that. There will be an economic advantage to offering trading on both.

Impossible to prove the meaning of that support. Empty rhetoric. I support bigger blocks if needed as a general concept, but I definitely don't support a coup, or turning over the reigns to a hard fork bent on hostile takeover, that's only a couple weeks old. 
This is an important time to be on guard against malicious influence. Markets are crashing. People are talking of a coming recession. And competition building from the banks' private blockchains ventures. On top of that, Hearn's "drop the mic" exit to R3 raising suspicion of media sabotage against bitcoin.

If these forks bootstrapped a network to test their fork first, I'd probably buy a couple btc classic coins and wish them well after a year or so of testing in the wild, sure switch over. But it's too risky for bitcoin to just jump over to an untested fork unless as a last option. No?

My logic: The strength of a ddos decreases as you add more targets. If you had to target 5000 classic nodes (as the claims imply are just waiting to jump on the network) the ddos would be mitigated to almost nothing. Unless you have several very large coordinated attackers more nodes makes you more secure. That's why bitcoin as a whole is safe. Pretty simple.


Please try to keep it together. You can't mine from aws. Why spin up 700 nodes that can't mine? The obvious answer is where shadiness comes in. 


DDoS is an internet wide problem. Large scale bitcoin mining operations have ddos protection. Many times the best protection is obscurity, but when people are waiving around and tracking and counting nodes of different flavors, it draws attention from across the internet. Is it the experienced miners fault for having good systems in place to deal with that? No, it's immaturity of new miners. 
I think it's just another example of the immaturity of the classic movement as a whole. They jumped in with both feet and have made some pretty juvenile mistakes. If they were experienced professionals with persuasive arguments, they'd be able of have nodes that aren't attacked. That's quite plain.

I'm not an expert by any means, but doesn't it have more to do with the number of signatures and not necessarily the size? Having to validate numerous signatures on inputs slows the process a ton, relative to the size increase (pre segwit). So 1.3gb could take a lot more time that 10secs.
Also, I wasn't aware of the 1.3gb limit. So the 2mb limit could lead to the same number of txns as a 1mb limit if txn size doubles?

The limited supply of ASICS is stopping them. How long would it take them to manufacture the number of ASICS they'd need to take over the network? A non-trivial amount of time, say a month or two at least. Banks, google, Facebook, aren't in the business of manufacturing ASICS, and they are public companies. Their move would be telegraphed to the community almost immediately, and people would probably come up with a defensive solution. It can't happen overnight like magic you know. There would be ramifications on both sides, both sides, including the large companies, would have to be ready to accept losses of capital.

No. The point is that the majority isn't always correct. Nothing was said about the minority and the correctness of their opinion. 
This tweet is worded poorly, it's not that the majority should never be able make decisions, it's that decisions are right or wrong apart from the opinion of the majority or the minority. 
Sometime the majority is "right" and sometime the minority is "right". Being a majority opinion should have little weight on rational decision making. That is a lesson for life in general, or bitcoin.

My transactions go through just fine. I've never had a problem and never heard of any of my acquaintances having problems.

I mean there's no noticeable effect except a couple anonymous redditors saying 'my transaction isn't getting confirmed', which could be user error.

Your first two points contradict each other don't they? If we benefit from full nodes, we benefit from running one ourselves.
There are ton of possible solutions. Even I came up with one, where someone creates a token on counterparty and distributes it's every block to full nodes that are registered say on a nonprofit site. Those tokens would have a market value, where the node operators could sell them. Or businesses could offer discounts when the customer uses one of those tokens.
Bottom line, it will be solved.

Agreed, classic is an altcoin. However, I was talking about political coup attempts of bitcoin itself. It will become a 75% attack vector repeated many times.
Just watch, the next attempted fork will be with a 51% threshold. First xt was 90%, then classic was 75%, both failed. The goal is control of bitcoin, and it's a possible plot by the incumbents (banks). I mean who even knew the toomims before this? (Pure educated guess on my part)

They are invalid and won't be used by other miners. The block reward isn't actually awarded until your block is 100 blocks deep from what I understand. 
If miners build on a block that most of the network sees as invalid, they will be wasting their efforts.
Miners don't want to work on an orphaned chain. If all miners accept &lt;= 1MB blocks, but only 50% accept &gt;1MB, it's in the best interest of the individual miner to accept and produce only 1MB blocks or risk being orphaned fairly quickly. There has to be an overwhelming concensus to switch, upwards of 90-95% to make the prisoners dilemma work out in favor of larger blocks.

Ok, so please clarify, until classic gets that 75% they are still the altcoin under your very own definition (as I said)? :) Would calling themselves bitcoin (or even a bitcoin fork) then be disingenuous and misleading, because it's not technically a fork at all with 0%? They are basically an altcoin project trying to get control of bitcoin by convincing 75% of bitcoin miners and users that their altcoin is better via marketing tricks? :)

There will be some sort of bailout for the oil industry tried first. This collapse is starting from there. Like TARP tried to bailout the banks, only after contagion spread did we see qe. ~50000 barrels of oil are traded in derivatives for every barrel of actual oil. Those books are basically worthless for banks on the good side of the trade, and going parabolically negative for banks on the wrong side of the trade. 
I don't think they'll bailout the "banks" explicitly. They'll say they are bailing out the oil industry, because that sounds good and patriotic even. But it's just money oil companies owe to the banks, hedge funds, pension funds and alike. So effectively it'll be a bank bailout. Maybe $1 trillion+. 
After that, we start qe4. Can you imagine raising the rates again later into an election year? Won't happen. But this boulder has already started rolling, and it won't stop because of fake stats from the Fed, BLS, or any other agency. 
The real big collapse (this year still, but maybe 2H) will come from the outside. The Euro exploding could be it, or Saudi/Iranian war, or natural disaster, or someone going to a gold standard, or something else. Idk for sure.
Bitcoin should perform well between the bailout and QE, where there is a momentary pause of several weeks where capital controls worldwide will be lifted. 
Just my thoughts.

You do, I do, every user, every dev and every miner. I'm not beholden to any particular coin or group of devs, and neither are you, neither are the miners. That's the beauty of this experiment. We can individually reason and make up our own minds about our own situation and opinion. It's subjective. But declaring the "correctness" of an opinion on the arbitrary fact of it being a majority or minority is fool hardy, and doesn't make success more likely. 
The devs are dealing with this now. They are making decisions based on their own reason and what they think is right. No one can expect any more. Their information/situation is different from all others, just like mine is different from yours. That doesn't make them right or wrong. They also have peers, other core devs, whose individual situations are closest to theirs and from whom they can get counsel. Their decisions will likely be better as a united group of experts, but they could be wrong. 
We may never know what's "right" for bitcoin as a whole, but we can know what's right for us individually. That's what the miners are doing, that's what the traders are doing, that's what the users are doing. Making decisions based on their situational input. Bitcoin's incentive structure helps, but it's still personal opinion. 
Maybe this is one reason most open source protocols stop changing after a while and osify, because changing them becomes politically impossible. It also could be peak hash power as miners face the realization that those ASICS actually increase risk of this type of gridlock (they can't switch to other coins as easily as users can). 


What will? Accepting the will of the majority? Maybe the minority? Talking about for 5 more years? People are working on it, the people that have been good stewards of this experiment for over 5 years.
But if I don't like how it's going, I can sell and buy ether or gold or silver (or heaven help me usd). But I'll make that choice, not the core devs or classic or any other politician/pretender/tyrant majority or otherwise.

Welcome back. Lots has happened in that time you've been out of the loop, including SegWit which is a soft fork that squeezes (or technically strips) transaction by 75%. So the effective blocksize will increase to 4mb.

Yes, and it would put pressure on the price to go down. The conspiracy theorist in me kinda thinks that people who want to keep bitcoin suppressed (banks and so forth) could actually push these big companies to accept bitcoin for that reason. 
On the other hand, if places start accepting ether, they'll probably sell that for bitcoin or dollars, which would be positive for the price of bitcoin.

This is an example of using bitcoin as a store of value, not as a payment system. Mexico's personal savings rate is traditionally very high, above 20%. Currently it's at 19%.
Bitcoin isn't competitive yet as a pure payment system, but it could be a good place for a portion of a person's long term savings. The savings options for the average person are limited in Mexico, being largely a cash based economy. As a Mexican, putting 5% of your cash savings in btc wouldn't be crazy at all considering the currency trouble they are having.

You have it a little backward, bitcoin isn't a company or a website, it's the dominant protocol with the highest network effects and a staggering lead in a brand new domain that has never existed before, proof of work. Even if it will one day be surpassed by another, anyone who thinks that now, does so against logic, and solely as an irrational guess. It might end up to be a correct guess, but there is no rational evidence on which to support it today.

Ok, we are getting somewhere. You seem to concede my point of the ethnocentric part. That you must look at the whole world, and understand there are different floating exchange rates between each currency pair. 
The dollar *did* change vs all those other currencies, however not 11%, but that's just because bitcoin was an outlier. You might be able to say usd dropped 1% vs the euro, but on the same day strengthened 0.5% vs the ruble. And the same day dropped 11% vs bitcoin. 
The dollar falls or rises relative to all currencies differently on each day, it's called floating exchange rates.

I have a friend, that buys gift cards (I think for the store Gamers) on purse.io at a 30% discount. He then he goes there and buys Walmart cards. So he turns btc into Walmart gift cards that he can buy basically anything with with a 30% profit.
Also, look into btc debit cards. You can charge them with btc and use it anywhere visa (or whatever) is accepted, even atms. Coinbase has a card, as well as bitwala I think.

It's an investment in 90% of the entire crypto space, and fundamentally the future of the entire thing. Imagine if bitcoin failed in some way.

Anything can store value. Paintings, ancient sculptures, real estate, etc. What makes gold special is its use as money. In fact, if it was not used as money it would still store value, only much less of it.
Gold is better money than a house because it has a better mix of the characteristics of money, i.e. *portable*, fungible, durable, divisible, recognizable, and scarce. If it were less of any of those things its store of value would be affected.
Say we find a huge vein of gold that doubles the supply. The store of value of each unit of gold would be affected. 
Bitcoin is superior in every one of those respects except arguably durability. Because it has a better mix of those characteristics, it will store value, period. To say people won't value bitcoin is like saying those characteristics mean nothing, and hence any argument for gold's value is also moot as well.

Weak. Being money is what gives gold almost all of its store of value. Real investors with real portfolios understand that gold has value because of it's unique characteristics. Just like homes have value because of location, amenities, being shelter, materials, etc etc. Real investors know that. Just like they know gold stores value because it's money, not because it's shiny.
Now if something were better money, real investors would recognize that as being valuable.

Thank you for the constructive reply. However,... I have a few issues. I realize this will probably have bad analogies, jump around, get into semantics to a point, but I'm very interested in this very topic.


I'm going to use this because it represents the idea of intrinsic value better imo.
There is a mechanism to get from a list of intrinsic properties to a market value. That process is what defines a market I guess. The complex organization of infinite human value judgements. It's the mismatch of value judgements that allow trade in the first place.
I value one bitcoin more than $730. The person that sells it values it less than $730. The fact that our values are different enables the trade. 
Intrinsic properties on their own cannot have any value without human subjective judgements. The sky is blue, chlorophyll is green, and gold is... golden :). None of those properties are valuable in and of themselves. Until you add people to the equation. 
To expand a little, stones are hard, wood floats, and gold is electrically conductive. But again, absent humans' subjective value of those properties, they have no value in and of themselves.


To be specific here, intrinsic properties cannot impart value, humans impart value based on them. As soon as value is mentioned it comes from subjective humans. The idea of value cannot exist in a world without humans. 


The value of gold if it were only used in industry, would be the subjective value of that use case. The same way we place value on a chemical or any raw material used in industry.


This is kinda weird because nothing can have zero intrinsic properties. It does make sense though if market value is based solely on subjective value, and if there was no such thing as some value superceding human demand.
Nothing grows with a value printed on it. We aren't bound by some natural law that if a thing is electrically conductive it must have a minimum of this or that value.


Natural properties cause *people* to place values on things, each on a unique scale. Everyone values everything slightly differently. An ounce of gold could be worth $1500 to one person, $500 to another, and $1 to another. (have you seen the Mark Dice videos where he can't sell a gold ounce for $20?) It's all subjective. 
My point is, there's nothing about gold that imparts some natural value that can supercede the subjective value of individuals. In the same way that bitcoin's value is 100% subjective, so is gold's.
@_date: 2016-11-25 07:53:02
Nature doesn't place a value on gold, people do. I'm trying to figure your position out. So intrinsic value is wholly separate from any market value, meaning it's just an arbitrary number of some kind? Are you saying intrinsic value is another way of saying natural properties? If so, that's no longer an argument on the "value" of gold, and doesn't seem to bear any weight on a monetary discussion. 
For those properties to have "market value", they must be subjectively valued. Usefulness can only be measured by price, especially for a store of value. 
@_date: 2016-11-25 08:17:45
True. The spreads on btc and ltc should equalize above global market value, because if it were more profitable to reverse the arbitrage you'd do it.
Btw, this seems like a good use case for a relatively liquid alt like ltc.

@_date: 2016-11-25 06:58:49
Your argument is faulty, because those non-monetary use cases of gold must be themselves subjectively valued. *All value is subjective.* Just because you can do something with an object doesn't mean there's any market demand for that use. Any value relies on someone somewhere, placing a value on that use case. Whether it's you yourself, or a trading partner.
Sure you can say everyone needs heat, so firewood will always have some subjective value. But that's different from saying that firewood has "intrinsic value". Say there's a historic lower bound to people's subjective value of that firewood, but if people find coal on the beach, that subjective value can decrease. And firewood on the forest floor with no people around has no value at all. 


The same as what you can do with gold if no one including you wants it, or anything made from it.
But your question about bitcoin is really a naive one, because what you are asking is, "What if no one wants to use the internet for commerce." Short of a complete regression of society to a point in our development before computers, that would never happen.

Nothing. There is no minimum price for anything based on intrinsic properties. Price depends on subjective values alone.

Walk through that logic a few steps and you'll find that people have to first demand bitcoin to carry value into the future.
People have to hodl it for some period of time, where it's 1 hour or 1 year. If people don't want to carry the value at all, they won't accept it for payment in the first place.
It also follows that if everyone wanted to spend their bitcoin at once, there would be a flood of bitcoin on the market and price would plummet.
Value is primarily dependent on its ability to hodl value over time, not its ability to be spent.

Commodities work well as money btw. Bitcoin *is* a way to escape, but the store of value comes first. No one would buy bitcoin if they didn't except to be able to spend it in the future.
Differences in time are the point. I demand it today, time 0, and want to spend it at time 0+x. If I expect it to be worth less in the future trade becomes more difficult. I won't be able to spend it if someone else doesn't want to accept it and hold it for their time.
 &gt;buy/sell
Think some more on the selling part. Why would someone sell something for bitcoin in the first place?

For people to accept bitcoin they must first demand it for their own future use. In other words, they must want to hold it for a period of time until they in turn spend it. Whether that's one hour, one day, one month, a year, or 10 years 's doesn't really matter. To accept bitcoin is to hold/store value into the future. Period.
Spending bitcoin is akin to liquidating your position. If more people want to sell, spend, or liquidate their bitcoin, the price goes down not up. Selling is in fact the only way for the price to fall, and holding the only way for the price to go up.

These guys cannot achieve something like bitcoin. They can put window dressings on the current system, add some UX flash, maybe some tokens, but they will never do censorship resistance or permissionless innovation. The same as govt will never willingly cut back spending, they cannot give the power of money back to the people and hope to retain political power. Things will get worse for them and their system until it breaks. 
So it's not a race with the banks/govt. Additionally, there can be only one main PoW chain, and there can't be any PoS or private chain that can compete. So that's not a race either.
Bitcoin is slowly consuming the world and can't be stopped by Ver or anyone else. This current blocksize debate is false urgency straight up. Relax, invest and trade. Have fun with the drama, because bitcoin's not going anywhere. It will scale on its own terms.

Traditional banking rules make the fiat side of the arbitrage very expensive and slow. If/when unocoin lists ltc/inr (or any other crypto pair) you can expect arbitrage to happen much faster via that other crypto.
For example, sell btc for ltc on unocoin. Send ltc to okcoin or bitfinex and sell for btc. Send btc back to unocoin. Repeat until the spread is gone.

Here's the situation. I'm sure you understand the velocity of money. If people spend more bitcoin, the velocity goes up, coins are easier to come by effectively raising the supply of coin chasing the same amount of goods (in the short term), and the value of btc goes down.
If more people hodl/save it'll result in the value of btc going up. 
It doesn't matter if you are selling for fiat, or within a circular economy. With fewer hodlers/savers the value of btc will go down in the short term. 


If there is demand for its store of value, people will provide products and services to trade for that value. Savings/hodling spur economic growth, not spending. The more people want to hodl something, the more it drives people to produce to get it, and the more valuable that something gets.

While that supply and demand thinking is correct in most cases, I think in a manipulated market it doesn't hold up as evidenced by those real world examples. 
A low spot price gives consumers (investors in this case) false information. When they are presented with high premiums, only the most informed people are willing to buy, many will simply buy online at a lower premium and wait a couple weeks. Plus the spot price of gold may fall tomorrow (as has been happening for a few of years), so retailers are caught between limited supply, manipulated and  falling prices, and online competition.
Im friends with a dealer in my town,  and at least I know he doesn't blindly map his prices to spot. He tries to pick the right price weighing a multitude of factors. But still has problems keeping things in stock. If you are trying to buy an ounce or two, the factors will probably differ. But if you buy and sell 1000 ounces a month, it gets trickier.

The gold market is completely rigged. Even if a big investor stood for delivery in a try to break the system, they couldn't because you can settle for dollars. That's by design of course. The only way to break the gold manipulation racket is for a very large nation to demand delivery. But with the wild and loose US military is a threat in that case. 
Bitcoin could lead the market to correct. Services like bitgold and bitreserve could play a big role, but also if bitcoin explodes in value, the spot light on the rigged gold market will get very bright indeed.

Granted I have limited experience with kraken or bitstamp, but you should be able to bend those rules no? Use a relative's address or a friend's? Maybe that's a business idea, to offer out of state addresses for NY residents that want to trade on those exchanges ;). 
I think the best thing would be for the exchanges to dismiss the regulations, and operate as if they don't exist. Maybe even offering trading with no fees for NY residents to stick it in their faces. But that's pretty scary though.

"A majority" of course is anything over 50%. But "the majority" to change rules has been set and approved through many BIPs in the recent past at 95%. It's just a very large majority. 
There is of course nothing binding about the 95% majority, other than any deviation could be interpreted as a blatant disregard for the integrity of the network and as an attempt to make changes by politically expedient means. Pretty simple man.

Paypal is definitely taking cues from bitcoin. So are the banks, as you can see in the topic de jour at Davis being blockchains (the international power banker convention that happened 3 weeks ago).
Personally, I think PayPal's use of the term "new money" is intentionally misleading. They know they aren't doing anything new. Many consumers will hear that, and think that something paypal's doing is actually revolutionary, or competing against the real new money, bitcoin. 
Their services are still centralized. You can't really send p2p like your post said. It just hides the layers of the stack with a beautiful UI/UX. You don't ever own your money outright and never have the right to their service. Take a look at the recent news about paypal blocking payments to VPN providers. Or freezing fundraising funds for encryption projects and regular users. Bitcoin's network is a global service, that transacts value directly from your control, to someone else's. It can't be stopped, it can't frozen, or closed. And it can be built upon without permission, without intellectual property restrictions, and without licensing red tape (in most nations). 
It's cool that PayPal is trying to emulate bitcoin in many ways. As a spokeswoman said after a bitcoiner produced an imitation video for "new money" (which they crushed through filing complaints). She said, "Imitation is the sincerest form of flattery.”

Bitcoin is unique. Where in all other open-source projects forks are fine, a hard fork by "alternate developer efforts" in bitcoin is highly destructive. That should be given. 
They are being treated as "hostile attacks" because they are. A peaceful way would be to fork and start at 2mb, compete and let miners and users come to you. But they didn't choose that. They have to instigate a hostile takeover with a 75% attack.

You wouldn't expect to see blocks with 13% of the node count? Why, because the node count means nothing, or is it because classic claimed all that "support" and it was fake, or maybe you expect that that 13% of the node count is just a few people replicating nodes somewhere? So it's basically at 0% and hence a bit funny.

That is logically inconsistent, because it equates the protection against rulers to being a ruler. The current state was arrived at through majority vote don't forget. 
Any fraction of the population is completely free to act within the current rule structure, whether it's a majority or minority, 50/50, or a minority of one. A minority can't change anything. 
We got to this point via the majority, not the minority. So there is no tyranny, no minority sponsored change, no minority rule, no compulsion to participate at all. The rules are set and can be changed by the majority over the minority, how is that a tyranny of the minority, quite the opposite.

Ok, so, I'll give it a shot, because I think it's a very interesting development, but it's all speculation obviously. 
Mining as a service might look like this. It'd be a service that would grow along with a fee market (a necessary part of it, in other words), which is currently a likely outcome of "undersized" blocks (from a agnostic transactional perspective). A fee market is likely going to emerge in the next year or two.
Concept 
Large mining operations would guarantee confirmation in the blocks they mine to customers of their MAAS. They'd sell that service for a set number of months or years in a subscription model. A person or organization would open an account and pay up front to guarantee their transactions make it into a block and not have to worry about transaction fees, mempools, and day-long confirmations. Customers would effective pay zero transaction fees on individual txns, paying for all of them up front. This would enable division of labor and specialization, and add certainty to a miner's income. Levels of subscription will be available, like 4 txns / day or 10 /day, or 100 / day. 
Usability 
This type of solution can exist in a nested structure of services, too. Perhaps a merchant uses lightning network payment channels with customers. They open and close these channels with customers at varying times and for varying lengths of time. LN basically has the ability to consolidate many small transactions into larger transactions in a trust-extending way. But the merchant needs to be able to settle those channels to the mainnet (blockchain) in an efficient manner without the risk of the opening or settlement getting stuck in the mempool of unconfirmed txns. So they subscribe to a MAAS provider, and transmit the transactions directly to the MAAS endpoint. A lightning channel has two txns, from what I understand, an opening one and a closing one. They can include 100s or 1000s of smaller transfers between those two.
Wages or other important txns may go through a MAAS because they are simply too important. Contracts for large business deals (like import/export txns or just-in-time supply chain txns) will have to take into consideration txns times and risks, and could have a section on the use of a specific MAAS. 
Visible aspect
Transactions could be encrypted and be sent to the miner using api keys for access, which is the common way services work already. A merchant could advertise the fact that they use a certain well known miner, similar to how they advertise that they use Visa, Mastercard or PayPal today.
There would be no necessity to use MAAS but individuals will need to understand the fee market to send a confirmable txn. There might even be miners that only confirm their own MAAS customers transactions, and other miners that are public. This could slow confirmation of "naked" txns (txns with no MAAS, my made up term). Online market places would partner with a MAAS, or provide their own, which would be a new emergent competitive angle. 
Something like this will definitely accompany a fee market, but it could turn out to look much different then my description. This was fun to think about. 
@_date: 2016-02-24 21:12:10

It did *not* happen with the euro. Is the euro a finite supply? Absolutely not. It just consolidated the power of monetary policy, which increased their power not decreased. That's much different than what you are claiming. 
You are claiming that the banks would voluntarily shoot themselves in the foot by taking the ability to increase the supply at will? That has never happened and will never happen, I'm sorry.

Thanks for the cordial response. I don't really want to beleaguere the point so I'll make this as quick as possible. Many altcoins have held the  spot and just a few short weeks ago, bitcoin was still 94% of the market. There is no reason to think this trend will change. 
Most eth volume is also btc volume because the main pair is eth/btc. 


I did a bad job explaining that. It matches the pattern of an exit scam, where holders pump the price to sell their coins. Ask yourself, 1) why sell the in a lump instead of as needed? And 2) why not use the coins themselves as money. 
Well, 1) they understood that they could manufacture some pump news to get the price moving up into the sale of those coins. Now there's new bagholders that want to pump to get rid of the coins to the next bagholders, and on and on. The devs couldn't sell them slowly overtime, because of the risk of much lower prices in a shallow market.
2) if there was real demand for their coin to be used, they'd be able to use the coins to pay for development directly, instead of needing to change it to other money first. Basically, it's not accepted even by the devs. 


Please think of it this way. The total crypto market is tiny, and the fact that it has transformative power is widely accepted in the halls of multinational financial corps. That makes it an easy target for manipulation on a social level. Egging on the FUD and heated debates. Throwing a few million at mining classic. Pumping other altcoins that aren't even at a self-proclaimed stable state like eth. I'm not saying it's definitely happening but it's definitely worth considering when evaluating arguments on every issue. These ideas should also add a small bias to conversation against change and toward bitcoin, and toward bitcoin core within bitcoin itself, simply for security on the social scale. 
I do hope some alts will succeed. Dash seems to have a great future as an oracle service for smart contracts, and litecoin has a long history and organic community. Ethereum though is just a long term dream/scam where the potential and possibilities will always be just around the corner. Speculative profits are great and all, but I urge vigilance and caution to the guys just out their diversifying (but it's backward diversification, where they want exposure to *more* risk for gains, rather than mitigation of risk, imo).

I agree with you on XT and Unlimited (though unlimited doesn't have the same... how should I say, level of emotional support as the others, so imo their nodes are probably fairly real). 
But I disagree that core currently has the incentive to use this strategy. It is in a position of 100% consensus and the number of nodes has been fairly constant throughout this whole period. 
Also, core's node numbers have a noticeable 'heartbeat' of nodes coming on and off the network during different times, which shows some economic incentives at work (Idk what those are exactly, but the variation is for a reason). Where the other nodes are relatively linear (granted they have been around a lot less time). 
But you are right, all implementations could use this strategy. And I do expect core supporters to use this if any fork's node numbers get to a level of concern. But you'll notice a steep increase in the number of core nodes at that time. 
Good conversation.

I'm sorry your pretend txn is not going through. Next time add a 5 cent fee. 
@_date: 2016-02-23 09:23:13
Lol, Most people get this instinctively, but I can lay it out for you.
Most transactions in a block today are for less than a dollar of value. These small value txns will slowly go away, being replaced by larger value txns, that can support higher fees. If there is a problem with mempool txns, like we've had before, nodes will simply handle it by dropping those txns faster. The bitcoin volume transacted will continue to increase as the actual number of txns remain constant or relatively so. 
Imo we will see $million txns commonplace soon and slowly lose &lt;$1 txns.
@_date: 2016-02-14 18:25:07

Right on. Agreed. The 2013 crowd definitely out numbers very early adopters. They gave an incentive to build the financial products that you mention, like options and futures. 
The 500 ramp late last year, felt like 2013, but was predictably reigned in by the very financial products that the speculators added. Kind of ironic in a way.
Those volatility mitigation products might keep the price slowly creeping instead of bubbling. But the halvening will have to be priced in, at the same time as the next type of people (who are hodlers) are coming in. Could get interesting and jump 100% in a month.

Agreed, imagination is the limiting factor. Paychecks as we know them, with two parties, will be a thing of the past. In the case of a business that has 100 employees, they could pay all employees with one txn, paying multiple addresses for each employee even, for example. 
That money will go directly to fund payment channels for services the employee uses. They same way you can split your paycheck now, some going to savings/investment accounts, some to checking, except much more complicated, and all in one txn. Rent/housing payments, internet, food delivery, entertainment, utilities, etc. The user could select a day of the month for settling on all their service channels. 
The possibilities are only limited by your imagination.

I hope I'm wrong, but it's being run by a very young guy (granted a genius coder) that is obviously confused about economics in his writings and has little experience with a consistent effort like this. I'd be very careful with ether.

I didn't say it was a good metric, I said to get an idea of the number of people that have a big issue with the blocksize. Active users is also a bad metric because people go to that sub specifically to speak out, so of course they are active. This sub I can imagine 75% or more people come here to click on the headline links and lurk, I don't think that makes them active. 
The number of aggregate nodes doesn't matter either. I suspect many of the ones reporting classic now are multiples spun up quickly on a host somewhere. Blocks produced by miners is the only aggregate that matters. Blocks, not nodes. Adoption doesn't matter either, it's blocks.

Price of silver would adjust. A silver dime would be worth about about $7 in today's money. 
Very rough comparison here, but my mother always told me when she was young, they'd go to the movies and it'd cost a dime for the ticket. Today the comparable ticket is about $7. A little money would go a long way if backed.
But this couldn't happen today, bc the police state is too far gone. Bitcoin is an end run around the banking system and the police state.

The supply is strictly arbitrary, apart from the need for small enough units to make change or accurate small adjustments in prices of goods. 
Two characteristics more important than total supply are 1) market cap, or the available through put for trade. Currently bitcoin is about $5-6 billion, that means all its uses have to be able fit through a $5 billion system. Sending a transaction over $1 million is rare, and $1 billion impossible, because that transaction is such a large percentage of the total through put. 2) an inelastic supply, thats a fixed amount, the more inelastic the better.
Edit: available supply depends on the use case. Some people save, so they view their savings as available, while other market participants view it as unavailable. I think you must consider the supply as 'total value available to meet demand', and the demand as 'total value demanded'. The number of coins is arbitrary.

This can happen but unlikely. Bitcoin is emergent order, if there is an overwhelming market need to scale, it will find a way.

You start from a pessimistic viewpoint, that bitcoin doesn't have usability. Bitcoin is currently so usable that the demand is outstripping supply. The price and fees show that usability is near ATHs.
I think you are confusing utility for a certain "use case" with total usability. Bitcoin is currently very usable, and becoming even better, to store wealth, buy censored goods and make high value transactions. It's becoming less usable for small payments. However, the total usability is going up as represented by the price.
Bitcoin seems to be fine on both your fronts.

I won't let this die because it's just FUD. *No one is stopping them from creating the code or even running it and gaining technical support*. There is only an effort by the community at large to avoid emotional manipulation to a *political end*. A change that is embroiled in emotion and doomsday propaganda is not welcome by most, not just core. 
Control of the reference implementation is the point, not writing code. Go write code all day long. That can't be the reason. If it's a real technical issue they can use the BIP process, create a pull request and openly debate in a professional way on the merits of their code. *1000s of devs have done just that*. To initiate hostilities by emotionally triggering users, is obviously a scam from miles away. If the code and need stood on its own, then the community including core, would support it, and probably help immediately. 
You may have been manipulated. In fact, many with the same complaints have been made trying to manipulate the issues. We must be vigilant for the encumbents (TPTB) trying to spread this very split of the community.

In the next 12 months or so, if they have a transaction that they aren't willing to add a fair fee to in bitcoin, they should use cash, or traditional systems. I can't speculate on what the solution is after the have gotten it "stuck" they should be smarter than that. 
Most of the txns today are for less than a dollar. I expect those to slowly consolidate to larger txns over the next year. The volume of bitcoin transacted each day will continue to increase as the number of txns /day levels off (in the near term). 
Stick to larger txns with larger fees.
@_date: 2016-02-10 21:29:11
There's a lot of variables involved but the idea that the transaction number is an abstract indicator for the price is likely sound. This is all a semi-off-the-cuff theory, so don't bust my balls. 
I think early bitcoin prices followed transaction number closely because of the type of people involved and the tech they had to interact with each other. Most were miners, users and/or holders. They wanted to use this awesome thing they found and we're working on. These people were freedom oriented, but not economical in thought process. The result of that 'hardcore' earlier adopter was a very close correlation in those two measures, price and number of transactions.
During the last bubble, beginning in Q3 2013, a different type of person was introduced to bitcoin. The sound money speculator (just made that term up now :) ), they are people that are amateur economists, and understand the unworkable nature of the regulated banking system, AND want to gain from the coming crash of the financial system (that's the speculator part). We saw the rise of the on and off ramps along with the speculation market. Price began to lead transaction number, but popped and now trails. 
The next type of people that are adopting bitcoin are people trying to preserve wealth. They are holders. First South America, then Europe, then eastern Europe, then Asia, then US. These people will be trying to convert their shrinking cash/life savings into a seemingly more certain form, not to spend but to hold. All due to negative interest rates and the failures of central banks. Fomo will ensue, and we could see ATHs in a month's time. That's not to say there won't be huge swings.
And I'm spent.

Thanks for the thoughtful reply. I hope you or others have benefited from this discussion. I have. 
Risk assessment - a systematic process of evaluating the potential risks that may be involved in a projected activity or undertaking.
Is a fee event possible? Yes. Is it likely? I don't think so, because there is little economic analysis more than "is it so hard to imagine". In other words, real analysis would exist and be readily available if this was even debatable as likely. 
If a fee event happens, could it be disastrous? Yes. Is it likely to be disastrous? Not likely, because we have related evidence to the contrary from when we've hit the block size limit already.
So a fee event is unlikely, and if it were to occur it is unlikely to be disastrous. Risk assessment would say have a plan, but with a 1%-5% chance of happening its not worth giving excess weight to when plotting a course forward. 
You can't compare the possibility or analysis of a 51% attack as you did, to the possibility of a fee event, because 51% attacks have happened! They aren't theoretical like a fee event. 
You can't compare a possibility or analysis about government raiding miners to a fee event, because governments have raided centralized competition and routinely attacks them. It has happened, it's not theoretical like a fee event.


Yes, if it's not possible due to small blocks. 
Numbers of txns from previous price bubbles happened with room, with no room in the block they can't happen. Very true, but that doesn't mean there will be a disastrous FE. 
To claim (or believe) that a fee event is likely (while possible but highly unlikely) is currently not supportable more than by intuition (unless there is evidence I'm missing), and therefore is FUD. If and when there is hard data, or detailed a risk assessment including mechanisms of how it would actually happen and which makes it likely, it will cease to be FUD.

No, it's a coup. The network is decentralized, but the reference client development isn't, and it shouldn't be. But you can make any changes to your own decentralized node you want. How about that? Innovation at the edges. That will eventually tie the hands of the developers anyway.

In a world where bitcoin is a major world currency, all other currencies will either have to be gold backed, or crypto, because the fiat national currencies won't be able to survive. 
A gold backed currency is unlikely in that world, as well, because bitcoin serves all its functions better. And other cryptos have a huge barrier to entry at scale to catch bitcoin. I'm skeptical of bitcoin as the world reserve currency of course, but can't think of a reason anything else would be. But no one knows obviously.

Ether is not bitcoin, so strictly eth discussion is usually frowned upon in this sub. Your post could get deleted mind you. Try r/cryptocurrency. 


I think they thought they were too smart for bitcoin, and tried to design a system with all sorts of features. They incorporated mainstream economic principles into the design, because they think those concepts are superior, and Satoshi's economics were wrong. 
In the end they only kept the decentralized nature and proof of work (but that's going away for proof of stake soon). They've also lost most of the economic incentive structure of bitcoin. Most of their founding team has left, and Vitalik is stuck holding the bag. 
I've been wanting to look into the founding team more. There has to be some fascinating stories, especially because it was a premine and ICO (initial crypto offering). I don't know a ton. Gavin was on it, and some say it was he who spearheaded much of the effort. Idk. It's crazy town. Obviously a pump and dump.

Yes, I sympathize with that. Like my last comment said, it's quickly changing to a store of value, as a whole. Single countries are already doing that, and I personally think those countries will push the value. But the US and Europe are still speculating. People in countries with high inflation rightly see bitcoin as a store of value already. I'm sure the rest of us aren't far behind.

I think a question that is not being asked is, IF the fork effort actually gains support from miners, what's to stop core from quickly adopting the changes into core itself to avert the hard fork and retain control? Would miners choose a hard fork team like the toomims or the existing core devs?
If a fork does ever get even half of the consensus to hard fork bitcoin (say 40%), the core devs will promise to immediately make the same changes.

I think it's more accurate to say, no one has the right to invade another's privacy. It's a semantic but an important difference. 
Rights can be delegated to others. In this case, the govt is of the opinion that the public has delegated the right to manage privacy to them. They think privacy is a right, so they can "enforce" it and "protect" it, as they see fit; take some from here and give some there. But if privacy is understood to be a restriction on your actions, then you can't implicitly delegate that right to the govt. It's negative v positive. You can't delegate something that you don't have in the first place.
If we view rights as restrictions on our actions instead of protections of our actions, the govt loses the implicit duty to protect us from ourselves. Freedom of speech for example, should be viewed as 'no on has the right to restrict my speech'. It's not that 'I have the right to say anything I want'.

Read your logic. Corn is the commodity, *not the contract*. That's the definition. Futures are contracts based on an underlying commodity (among other things). If you can go to the farm/store and buy one commodity (corn) unregulated (in your argument), why not go to the miner/store and buy another commodity (bitcoin)?
I pressed the issue, because your answer wrongly defined a commodity as synonymous with futures contracts (reread it). The OP was just saying that corn is a commodity, but he happened to use the fact that it's traded on exchanges to support his claim. 
The right answer would have simply been to say bitcoin is not a commodity, or that only in limited circumstances is bitcoin regarded as a commodity because the regs are foobar. Not an "idiot's question". 
BTW I think it was a strategy for different agencies to make different definitions for bitcoin. That way it's subject to more regs than anything else (except maybe drugs). It's basically maximized their control of it.

Negative interest rates (NIRP) can't exist naturally in the market, they are set by man for a reason, to shock a dying patient. NIRP is a symptom of a fatal condition in an economy. 
Zero percent interest rates can be *perceived* by the market as natural, because it can actually exist naturally in the free market (for very short periods of time). The idea behind control of the interest rate came from the observation that when interest rates were low, the economy was doing well, when interest rates were high the economy was shrinking. But it was a chicken and egg argument. Bankers currently believe that lower interest rates lead to growth, when in actuality it was growth that led to low interest rates. 
The more they push on the string and lower interest rates, the more bumps in the string appear (narrowly focused asset inflation and deflation), but the economy as a whole doesn't improve. 
NIRP is the inevitable conclusion of this exactly backward belief, that you can create stable economic growth with lower rates. When it doesn't work at zero, the bankers' logical conclusion is lower rates still (negative). 
In a healthy economy interest rates are much higher than zero, ie ~5%+/-. Markets can be fooled with ZIRP for a while, but eventually the dislocations in the market correct. NIRP is just a last ditch effort before the acquiescence of failure.
Bitcoin takes the monetary policy tools out of the hands of men, and place them in the hands of the market. A bitcoin economy is a breath of fresh air for people that have been stuck in the crazy fantasy world, where the laws of physics are backward, the fiat banker system.

Bitcoin's ultimate goal is to survive. It's in a state of a hyper free market. 
To survive it grows, it consumes, it adapts, it even evolves. It will die someday, too (not soon), but it's offspring probably will takeover where bitcoin left off. 
The community around bitcoin is very diverse, ranging from american-anarchists to South African socialists, to Phillipino entrepreneurs. It is a miniature replica of an alfernate global economy and will open new areas for bitcoin growth. The community has a niche for everyone, and will continue to spread (exclusive of reddit surely). The community isn't bitcoin, but it is a symbiotic relationship.
Bitcoin's natural predators in the beginning were many, but now are few. It is excellently adapted to its habitat, and has an evolutionary advantage over the other species.

SPV nodes/wallets download only the block headers right? That might answer your question. 
Also see pseudoNodes:  it's basically a way to run a node, but pass all requests to another node, so you don't have have any of the blockchain. I call it a fake node, because it can be spun up to look like a node but it's not. (see classic node count).

If you look at the numbers for the nodes, xt has dropped by 200 nodes this month, and unlimited by 40 or so. With 272 reporting classic one could assume 30 new uniquely classic nodes. If classic were to get the remaining xt and unlimited nodes it would be 581 nodes, or 12%. We'll have to see. 
Also 0 classic blocks!, which should lead a person to suspect that that 5% of nodes doesn't include any miners. Dead-in-the-water xt has more blocks than classic.

They'd need $4 billion worth of bitcoin. You can't pay for txns in $. To get that amount the price would have to moon (relatively to the dollar which would collapse). They'd at least have to let through enough txns to buy their supply for the fees. They can't buy that much bitcoin and go unnoticed and they'd need to find a seller of bitcoin that wants to harm the system for (at that point) worthless usd.

Two quick thoughts. It's interesting that a big reason these HFs try to hijack the bitcoin network with a 75% threshold is because they can't bootstrap a new network due to different attacks. But the same thing happens if they try to hijack the network. Kind of damned if the do, damned if they don't. 
Second thought is that with xt and now with classic, HFs have both apparently miscalculated their moves in the game theory. We are learning a lot from this, and future efforts will have different game theory inputs. Miners are also finding out consequences of actions from a game theoretical pov.

Btc would have to be a LOT higher than 10,000$ for them to pull this off. We are talking about a different universe for price. Any certainty about the time when btc is 1,000,000$ is pure guessing. 
My main critique was on the process of getting to this hypothetical situation. Yes, if we snapped our fingers and changed reality to fit the assumptions, than yes it's possible. But getting there has way too many obstacles for this consortium. And keeping their monopoly would be even more difficult. A consequence of their monopoly would be a large market for a sidechain or alts that undercut it. Basically, I think it's interesting to think about, but not possible.

The riyal/usd peg doesn't matter so much, it's the sale of oil in USD that actually matters. I think an interesting aspect is that the Saudis probably felt as though accepting USD for oil would insulate their economy, kind of like accepting the US as good stewards of the Saudi economy, tying their economy's fate to that of the most powerful nation. That is breaking down, and with it the Saudis loyalty to the USD might fall. OPEC could start accepting Yuan or Euros, and that would mean the collapse of the dollar.
That collapse of the petro-dollar would leave a reserve vacuum, devoid of an all-powerful reserve currency. Bitcoin might perform well as the world is searching for a reserve currency, just as gold definitely will. I don't think the world or bitcoin is ready for a bitcoin reserve status, but several smaller more flexible countries that hold dollar reserves could choose to replace some of those dollars with bitcoin as part of their reserves, say 5% - 10% or something. It will be easier for them to buy and secure their bitcoin, than to buy and get gold delivered. 
Another worry is that reserve currencies don't fall without war.

There will always be some people that disagree. Can't make everyone happy. 
Though it might seem like the community is very split by looking at reddit, the split isn't that big in reality. 
You can get an idea of how many people truly have a big issue with the blocksize by looking at the number of subscribers in r/btc vs this sub, because r/btc is seen by many to be the hard fork sub. It's only about 6% as large and some of those are observers. So saying 5% are really up in arms about the blocksize is probably pretty close to the truth. Some will try and convince you otherwise, but make up your own mind.

The question in my mind is how to start trading it. Or how to bootstrap the market on the exchanges servers. Will all existing trades be valid on both coins? If I'm long 10 btc at $300 before the fork, do I have two positions after the fork, long 10 btc &amp; long 10 classic? You have to fund margin too, which some traders won't want to use money to fund a loser on the alt coin. Or immediate losses on the altcoin could screw with your margin on the mainnet coins. Maybe I've maxed my margin that is a USD balance and not margin held as btc. Then I won't have enough margin for both positions and my trades will be liquidated. 
Or maybe you just get your balance of btc duplicated on the exchange and one of them will start with no open positions? But then how to pick which fork's coins to keep positions open on and which to clear? They'd have to go with the fork they think will be the longest chain. 
I'm just guessing that they won't offer both. 
I guess I'm just saying that it would be a massive undertaking with months of planning for an actual switch (or fork event). As a trader, I think these concerns are under represented.

Sidechains are theoretical still. The question on how to secure them isn't a trivial one. They have to be protected by a proportional amount of mining power to their total value or they will be attacked by Bitcoin miners themselves because the incentive structure is not connected. Technically they will work, but economically they could be a huge failure. 
Imo viable sidechains will likely be in the form of explicit altcoins, not using SHA256, that can settle on the bitcoin blockchain in a decentralized way. Blockstream isn't the big bad wolf.

This is chart is typical in a moderately increasing price environment. The difficulty changes every 2016 blocks. The different colored lines on the chart are just different moving averages of the hash rate. 
The moving average that matters is the 2016 block moving average. As you can see when it comes time to change difficulty, it resets to the green line. 
A mining heartbeat of sorts emerges, as miners try to game the difficulty change by increasing their hash rate right after the reset and backing off as they approach the change again.
If the price was behaving differently, going up quickly or down the hash rate would be acting differently. As the price increases quickly for example, there is little incentive to back off the hash rate into the difficulty change.

How's this? Full of subjective statements, but the basic happenings as I saw them. Disclosure I'm pro the professionals (and that's core). Sorry, it's kinda a stream of consciousness. 
They, classic, came out of nowhere, with no background in bitcoin development. Classic was basically a multi-level marketing campaign, that centered around a voting website bitcoin.consider.it from which they are supposed to take their marching orders on development from the community (their site, with no customers and never any, Bitcoin was going to be the first one). 
They are the toomim brothers. One's kind of a developer, and the other is a front-end and marketing guy, not professionals like core. They came on the scene with the backing of Gavin, who has been obsessed with hastily pushing through a hard fork (for some reason), and Garzik. There are lots of threads in this story that allegedly intersect through coinbase equity, not surprising coinbase supports a hard fork too (for some reason). 
Jtoomim made a very public display of incompetence a few weeks back, when he went into a group chat with the core devs and was talking about talking to fish when he was on acid, and that he was high at the time (claimed acid and weed, but then later said just weed). A couple days later he gave an interview and sounded completely out of his league answering simple questions about their vaunted support, which has never been satisfactorily explained, it appears they have none. No support from the miners at least as claimed. They do have support from lots of new accounts on reddit, and lots of fullnodes on the network. No miners though. And he couldn't answer any technical questions at all. 
They released the beta of their client a week or two ago, and now just released their production version for miners (but none have started using it). 
This is a political battle for control of the software, taking development out of the hands of the professionals that have proven themselves and loyal, honest and brilliant, and putting it in the hands of lessor programmers, with no history whatsoever of loyalty and honesty. The classic team has publically stated that they will simply copy all the code from Core in the future. Which made some core devs upset that they were being plagiarized.
There are lots of accounts here that are just looking to stir up trouble (trolls) on the side of classic. Core's development road map includes an effective block increase to just under 2mb, while at the same time fixing lots of things necessary for scalability in the future,  all by April. It's a real work of genius. Classic is not letting up on their insistance on 2mb NOW, though they have no clear roadmap, other than mob rule voting on features, and copying core's code.
Ulterior motives, no one knows obviously, but some people think the simultaneous nature of the appearance of R3CEV and Hearn's rage quit, along with the back to back hard forks is fishy. Bitcoin's only real weakness is human control over development. The devs and the process. It would be logical to go after that weakness in this very way if you wished bitcoin ill, or were scared of obsolescence. 
@_date: 2016-02-25 01:18:51

Bitcoin is a decentralized network. Not a decentralized open source project. You can't have decentralized development, where everyone has commit authority. That's crazy. Absolutely no one is advocating that development be decentralized. Even classic will have certain people with commit authority.
What you can have is decentralized innovation, which (since you might not understand) means everyone is free to build on the network at will. It's an open source protocol. Please refrain from saying the development should be decentralized, it makes your arguments very ineffective.

That is the central debate actually. How come classic restricts their commit access; it should be completely open and decentralized no? /s Bitcoin is completely open for anyone that wants to create a pull request to do so. But there are a few people with commit access for a very good reason. Popular/political opinion really doesn't matter unless it's overwhelming like 95%. As an aside, if the govt needed 95% to change/make laws we'd all be better off, because the Constitutions would actually mean something. 


If that's not purely 100% unapologetically political, I don't know what is.

Are you calling the futures contract on corn itself the commodity? I thought futures were contracts on an underlying commodity/security, in this case corn. You can buy a futures contract that settles within a very short period time. The corn is still the commodity, and is bought in small portions at the store. 
Or maybe you are saying that bitcoin is a futures contract so it can't be traded as small amounts at retail? 
So like the OP asked, why can't a store sell tiny pieces of a bitcoin, which would act as the commodity underlying a futures contract,  just like corn?

Take a look at their statistics. They are POW, they have one miner with 57% of the mining power. Hash rate is barely increasing. And txns are negligible and declining. People will still cash out winnings to btc. It's the next iteration after homestead, that they need to worry about, the move to POS. 
I think it's interesting that when bitcoin jumps in price, transactions go up. That is counter intuitive to the monetary inflationists out there (cough keynesians). This phenomenon shows that when bitcoin goes up, people feel wealthier, because they can actually use bitcoin, so they spend it. With ether, you cant spend it anywhere and no one actually uses it, it's pure speculation, so the txn number goes down with price spikes as people hold. This is just a little taste of how empirical evidence from bitcoin will reshape mainstream economics, if I may be so bold.

Depends how fast it happens. And if there are any buyers for eth. The eth market is extremely shallow. If only 5% sell with little replacement demand, the price could drop to nearly zero fast, and the rest of that half billion $'s will evaporate. Imo only about 5-10% of that value can escape into bitcoin. It'd still be quite a move, maybe 100-200$ (followed by a 50-100$ drop).

A contentious hard fork is one that attempts to achieve consensus on the same network (of miners and users) against the original implementation's objection. 
A related example from another community might be node.js v io.js. They competed as the "reference" implementation of a non-blocking js server. But this isn't a perfect comparison because they didn't have to worry about mining. (they were separate forks for a couple years and recently merged again) 
A typical hard fork doesn't attempt to take over master branch development of the original project, and doesn't threaten the viability of that original. For example, bitcoin HFs have been very common in its history, but they result in an altcoin because it doesn't attempt to take over the master implementation of the software. 
You also have to consider the competition for miner acceptance, which is unique in contentious cryptocurrency HFs vs typical software HFs. If current miners have to "choose" between HFs, it's contentious.

Thank you for well intentioned definition, however economic majority is still a nonsensical term. There are no "votes" in economics, there is only trade or lack of trade. That is not to say economics is devoid of value judgements, it is basically a big value computer that results in a price. But there are no votes other than trade.
When you use the term "vote" that should be a give away that you are speaking of a "Political Majority" and not an economic one. I think some in the bitcoin space use the word 'economic' to give their argument some free market sounding principles, but basically they mean 'political'. It a case of double speak. 
@_date: 2016-02-01 18:57:56
You'd have to be able to trade both forks' coins. Idk if exchanges would offer that option. But yes there will be some economic warfare if a fork ever happens. 
Another interesting angle is what exchanges are going to tell traders via ToS about their trades that might end up on another chain. Or will they keep a market for btc and classic separate? Gresham's Law says debtors will want to settle in the smaller fork. If there are two chains, contracts and ToS will have to be updated well a head of time. Markets are so interconnected with services and exchanges at this point that a hard fork could have very unexpected consequences. The futures market will be where to see the action up to months ahead of a fork. 
Thank goodness we are safe from a hard fork for the near future.

So, what happened to your first strict definition of contentious? 


I said that’s too simplistic, because every hard fork has some level of disagreement and controversy. You can’t please everyone. There is always going to at least one voice of disagreement. When I said, “No it’s not.” It became contentious by your definition.
 
You seem to agree with that, while trying to disagree, 



So do you want to modify your original definition?
I think the definition of contentious hard fork is, a hard fork that attempts to takeover the parent implementation’s network, despite that original implementation’s objection. Clean and simple. If there was no objection, it would not be contentious. If control of the network was not play (ie results in an altcoin), it would not be contentious.

95 - 24 (the decrease in the other forks) = 71 new nodes for classic. 
71 new nodes for classic, 100 for core. 
BIGGEST METRIC = 0 blocks mined by the approximately 7% of the network that is classic. Pitifully low. We'd expect out of 144 blocks a day, at 7% of the network, classic should be accounting does 10+ blocks a day.  0 is a huge red flag.

The monetary definition of inflation has to change a little I think. Currently it's an increase in the money supply, which bitcoin absolutely fits, but the increase in supply is know exactly at every period in time and can be used in subjective analysis today.

There is more negative supply uncertainty than positive I think.

One of the main factors to consider in the "banning cash" debate is that something like 90% of USD bills are held outside the US proper. Most of that is in $100 bills. Indeed, 75% of USD cash is $100 bills. Imagine you are an Argentine with $10k stored in $100 bills. The processes involved are very complicated, uncertainty and risk go way up. 
If I were holding USD as a store of value, and the US changed it issuance rules, I'd question holding USD at all. Wouldn't you. So I trade it in for $20s, what happens when those go away? Massive dumping of foreign held cash. Massive inflation. Massive panic. 
Ive considered draining my savings account recently. I'm not getting any interest to speak of, the risk of not being able access it is increasing, and now I have to worry about the denomination I take it in. Why bother. Just buy bitcoin or gold or silver.

Lol thanks for the an explanation of a hard fork at this point in the conversation. 


A core fork would start from agreement and strive for consensus. Sounds funny to imply that the way to agree is to first disagree (starting from agreement would be hard forking with core, offering a competing implementation is starting from disagreement). War is peace right?


I think that's wrong on many levels. Then why court miners? Why not just fork and get it over with? There is obviously so much more to bitcoin governance than the technical definition as a hard fork. BIP is the governance structure of bitcoin. Hard forks can be BIPs, they can be accomplished inside the governance structure. Replacing the BIP process is a political aim.

Why would 99% of miners switch? It's game theory. They might want to switch, but they have no idea if the rest will switch too (even with assurances). If a miner with 20% switches and no one else does, that one miner is screwed. It is best to do nothing.

Obviously it's marketing. But to say, as you do, that they actually mean something different is a stretch. Why not just say, "digital, effortless, convenient"?

That is a valid argument. It does remains to be seen if sidechains actually work out. However, bitcoin is programmable and provable, gold is not. A bitcoin certificate (what that would look like) would be naturally superior to a gold certificate, because you can't prove there's any gold. But imo that won't be necessary because of off-chain provable low trust solutions.

You need to check your facts on Australia, too. Looks like the gun grab took credit for an established trend. 1985 they had 4 gun *related* deaths per 100k. In 1996 when the gun laws came around there was already a dramatic decrease to 2 / 100k. The decrease leveled out after 96 at 1/100k. And homicides and robberies went up.

If it's the international banks I'm even more skeptical. Any sort of gold backed crypto, will have to prove gold reserves. They don't have any. If they wanted to settle contracts, it would be at 200/1 today, ie 200 legal/contractual claims of ownership on every ounce of gold in the banks' possession. 
There is no way the banks could create a gold standard crypto without first acknowledging the extremely perverted gold market today. That would destroy their cred.
And what exactly makes you think they do tech well? I disagree. The credit card companies might to tech well,but not banks. Many banks use 1970s mainframes.

Nope. I run two full nodes that aren't miners. It's a square and rectangle thing. All miners are nodes, but not all nodes are miners. I can set up 10+ nodes in about 30 mins for nearly free, but to mine I need to invest lots of capital in equipment and electricity.
Sorry if I laid on the sarcasm too thick there in the last comment. Heat of the moment last night and all. To evaluate what's happening in the classic node count and block count, you have to understand that people can fake nodes pretty easily by making one instance look like 10 or whatever number, but they can't fake hashing power and mine a block. Therefore, when we see the number of nodes going up to a significant level, which they are now, like 15% but no associated blocks, one can conclude that the nodes are faked (doesn't mean they are, just a logical conclusion). If they weren't fake, and represented a move toward consensus, math tells us they should be mining something. Even as little as 1/1000 blocks, but should be more like 150/1000. The fact that they aren't means that core still has 100%, with no signs of significant loss of even 1%. Pretty solid, and it begs the question whether any of the support classic claimed was true at all.

I agree with the confiscation part. In gold, diversification should be done by holding it in several jurisdictions (which I understand excludes 99% of the world's population right there). 
Asteroid mining is a stretch. I understand it's a possibility in the distant future. But I believe it's at least a 22nd Century thing. Aside from that, gold's value should remain constant in purchasing power terms in the long run, like it has for 1000 yrs.

It remains to be seen what R3 uses. There is a chance they are just going to use the ethereum smart contract language serpent. One thing you find out about ethereum is that there are so many layers, pieces, and complex incentives that it stops making sense eventually. 
R3CEV probably isn't supposed to be the first marketed push by this consortium. It's am effort to build industry intelligence for the incumbents. Feel out the community and the developers, maybe experiment a little, and study (basically gather intelligence). Why would these companies include each other on the next big thing? They will individually use the intelligence gathered for their own products. Why would JP Morgan want to share their platform with the other guys?

110% correct. It's a political battle. Long term, I'm agnostic about a political battle. I think that'll work itself out. But short term (a year or two), we have to stick with the core devs. Maybe we'll be passed the point that we can update the protocol by then anyway. Who knows.

The reasoning on sentiment in your argument is a little unclear. This is all extremely new, so no one really knows. 


Imo If a fork is coming close to consensus, that means that the outcome of a HF is viewed positively and hence sentiment is positive. Maybe as the initial RELEASE of the HF software approaches there would be uncertainty and negative sentiment (price goes down), but as it approaches consensus sentiment will turn positive again (price goes up). So as a HF looks more likely sentiment should be generally positive right?

Imo, if people actually want to ensure privacy they must change their relationship to govt. Playing inside the game of Constitutional this or Supreme Court that, is a losing battle, because it's based arbitrary definitions, rights, and interpretations, as Apple is finding out. Those things can be changed at anytime, and your arguments fail, because of a 4 to 5 decision of some people wholy disconnected to you.

Be brave. There is no problem with higher fees. Some txns might get stuck for a while, but not by the folks that include a steady &amp; fair fee. Transactions get cleared from mempools when individual nodes are shutdown, or are actively purged. It's not a big deal unless you are dependent on several tiny, free txns a day. 
We have hit the 1mb limit already with little consequence. Just be aware of the fee needed. If anything, it'll be a gradual increase in the fee while SW get fully implemented. The we'll have a little breathing room until the next concern.

I understand it's a devil's advocate position, but I'll answer it. That all presupposes that retail is the main use case of bitcoin, and the only thing that makes up the bitcoin economy. That bitcoin must magically make shit business models successful. It doesn't. If businesses don't make money, that's not bitcoin's fault, it's the management's. Business models will need to change to fit bitcoin to be successful.


Hodling _is_ the bitcoin economy. Retail is only a marginal use case. People don't spend gold coins either. However, for completeness, the blockchain does show that there's an _increase_ in transaction volume during price spikes.

What about accounting for lost coins or burned coins? They add deflation into the mix in a non-trivial way. Satoshi's coins maybe gone forever, and there are surely 100s of thousands more already. And more in the future for sure.
The coins "yet to be claimed" should be thought of just like the majority of coins that haven't moved in years. It's like they are just sitting there being held by a whale and slowly "spent" into circulation. But most likely they'll end right back up into someone's long term hodl.

This is interesting. Last year I noticed that bitcoin txns clustered around daylight hours in western Europe and the US, peaking right in the middle of that time. I think that's still the case though I haven't checked in a while. We are told that China is such a big player but this evidence doesn't support that. Miners yes, but users and txns, no. Bitcoin and interest in bitcoin is centered on Europe and the US.

Of course we see this all the time with vaults full of allocated accounts. Gold is one example. Vaults have third party auditing (replaced by the blockchain).

2x supporters are a tiny minority, yes they are. Apart from not seeing a user led movement of 2x supporters, I don't see many at all anyway. I'm in a bunch of groups in this space and &lt;5% of people support 2x, at the same time it's &gt;50% for status quo/lightning/security/best devs. I haven't met people that "don't care". They just don't know what the situation is, but are thirsty for knowledge and concerned about a centralized takeover.
As for the "takeover", nice try. Something doesn't have to be centralized to be taken over. 2x is trying to usurp our choice of implementation (there are 6 on the network, not just Core) and centralize development for the benefit of select business interests. They are literally trying to takeover your node's independence with a backroom deal between some crony CEOs. No thanks.

Other world events and monetary theories are not independent. Bitcoin is not in a bubble all by itself. The "price" has to be measured in something and the standard today for many is the dollar. How would we measure any effect of the reward halving if we didn't have a standard to price it in? Gold could fit there, but has yet to. The dollar in turn is effected by currency wars all over the world, a recent example being the Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank (AIIB) that is trying to end dollar reserve status. Bitcoin is interlocked with other currencies.
The supply curve is vertical yes, if the time scale is ten minutes, but on the day level it's fluid. FYI, block rewards can't be spent for a specific period of time after a block is accepted. I think 100 blocks.

You have to make too many assumptions about demand. The supply is set, the demand is the question. 
I think by that time we will have a much higher "buy in" from miners. Their total investments of rigs and coins will be higher. They will have more reason than in 2012 to secure their investment.
There are an estimated 7 mil people world wide that own bitcoin,  and few are miners or traders. The pricing in of the block reward halving on market price will happen only a few months prior if at all.
Some have said this will result in a deflationary spiral, but the demand at that time will tell.

While you are basically right, I think it's a more complex issue, tax enforcement is a question of marginal cost. For example, say it cost the IRS $5k to audit and prosecute an average traditional banking user, it would cost them $25k or more to do the same to someone that regularly uses bitcoin. It will become cost prohibitive quickly. Add to that the reduction in tax revenue if a significant fraction of the population starts using it. For those reasons, they go after the bigger fish as examples.
99% of average joes or janes will be perfectly safe dodging taxes, unless you flaunt it around. Btw get it from localbitcoins, an ATM, or accept it for side jobs.

"save you while praying they don't crush you"
How so? I can't speak for anyone else, but this is good news bc bitcoin plays by different rules. Rules that can't be changed arbitrarily by ballot box stuffing or the full force of the 'system'. 
There are two positives from their involvement. The price goes up, and they walk into a new system that destroys them (in their current form). There's not really any negatives other than they try to regulate, which will be ultimately self defeating too.

They can't get the hashing power to secure it. When bitcoin started, few knew about it and let it grow in virtual anonymity. Today, hackers would be all over it. They even have lessons from bitcoin on the best attack vectors. It'd be toast. The banks' chain would be worth trillions, while having relatively weak security. Just a huge honey pot. 
Plus the incentives would most likely be much worse than bitcoin's. It's nearly impossible to build mutually beneficial incentives into a protocol and still have any sort of control.

You are using a false definition of "bank". The modern bank is different from "vaults" of the past. When you define a bank as an institution that thrives on fractional reserve in an environment of heavy regulation, it's difficult to argue against. You need to define bank as a vault, or separate the definition of a savings institution from a lending one. The fact you think they are (or should logically be) the same is wrong.

Highly unlikely. Rehypothication happens to non-cash assets like mortgages, gold, or securities. You can't rehypothicate a $100 bill in other words, you could rehypothicate the liability of a $100 loan though. Much of this happens in a decentralized and OPAQUE manner. No one knows who owes whom. That can't happen with smart contracts and blockchains.

OK, I'll alter my position a little. A private blockchain of any substantial value is nearly impossible to create at this time. The incentive to attack a network increases as the value of the network increases. Individuals, families, small cities, or small businesses could use private blockchains, but very large values can't use private blockchains because the incentives don't align. Sidechains will be used for those guys, still reliant on a dominant blockchain (bitcoin for now). 
@_date: 2015-09-12 08:16:52
I misread your point above, bc the thread was about the banks involvement in experimenting with making blockchains. So, about the dev team. I'm not an expert obviously, I'm just a guy, but I have some opinions on the core dev subject. 
First off, the crisis of a schism has been avoided for now. You might say it was all due to manipulation of subs and forums, and that people were mean to each other, or exposed negative tendencies, etc. I look at it as the free market finding a solution. Incentives weave a complex web around all players in bitcoin. 
Secondly, for one person (or a small group) to claim they know the right answer to scale is ludicrous. An free market is much smarter. Bitcoin will scale in unforeseen ways. No one can force it. 
Third, and to your point, the Bitcoin experiment has shown that it is more resilient to these types of hostile takeovers than anyone thought. Banks can't just come in and pay a couple core devs to fork the network and think it will work. The users have the final say. The core devs will slowly lose their jobs anyway as osification takes over. 
Note: some think that the core dev team is already bought and paid for with the MIT deal.

I hope they try some "private" blockchain and it blows up in their faces. Facts are, if it's private it can still be cooked (rolled back), and if it's public and small, it'll be attacked. 
I can see sidechains. But if they used that term people would immediately realize it's dependent on bitcoin.

You opinion on the ease of taking over the network has been thoroughly debunked. There are only certain manufacturers of asics. If an institution was to try and acquire enough hardware to take over the network it would be noticed. Similar to when DHS bought all those rounds of ammo, few others could buy ammo at that time. People would see that coming a mile away. The network would adapt to the new situation and prevent that from happening in unforeseeable ways. Perhaps the increased demand raises the prices of hardware to a level that allows more manufacturers to enter the market. 
Its my opinion that the manufacturers are the weak point in the whole system due to their vulnerability to the govt's guns, but it's not a huge vulnerability. The threat of foreign competition is first  among the counter measures. 
It's not as easy as you seem to think.

Why cash out? Localbitcoins and ATMs to go from fiat to btc. You can use btc for almost everything minus utilities and mortgage/rent. Put 25% of your fiat income into bitcoin through those venues. If you get paid in bitcoin it's no issue. It would take a little doing but many would think a 50% tax rate in some US states would be worth quite a bit. Even if you could save 10% on your tax bill, you'd be defunding the State.
Cash out $200? I'm talking about cashing in $2000 to btc every month to avoid taxes, not money laundering. All that stuff about how easy it'd be to gather information is true. It's very possible, no one will argue against that, but it's NOT CHEAP for them. I'm saying that it'd be too expensive for them to go after more than the 1% biggest targets. Just making it a little more expensive than traditional banking audits would be enough to avoid many audits. If you retain a tax attorney, it'd be even harder for them to get you.
The IRS has procedures to follow. They don't think outside the box. While DHS or the FBI are relatively spun up on btc, the IRS isn't. They'd need a major case as precedent, and new published procedures for blockchain audits or whatever. It's not as straight forward as you say.

You missing my point doesn't make my comment vapid. Many transactions that happen with and that are enabled by "money today" are wasteful, unnecessary or off-the-books (not to mention down right falsified). It is completely possible that the abuses of "money today" would be mitigated if it were harder to transact.
The final use of the Bitcoin blockchain is unclear. It's quite possible that it won't even b used for daily transactions, and emerge as a pure savings vehicle or Gold standard of sorts. Maybe sidechains take off. No one knows. But to say bitcoin must emulate money today and support billions of transactions comes across as overly confident and very nearsighted.

Anarchy is all around you. It's our natural state of being. We are in a state of anarchy all the time. Only a fraction of the time do we change our behavior simply because of a rule or our ruler. Whenever people arrange themselves or interact in an emergent fashion that is anarchy. 
Think of anarchy like those crazy traffic crossings in NY or Tokyo. People cross and weave in between each other. Everyone gets to the other side without someone holding their hand. 
Or your relationships with your friends. Hanging out. 99% of your time is not thinking about laws or government (unless you are talking about it). 
One of the easiest places to see anarchy today is at the nation state level. They exist in an state of freedom and contract. Some states apply force, which is war. But in general when force is applied in any situation civilization is set back, not advanced. We are civilized because of free interaction, not some ruler's whims and force.

You charge the depositor to hold the money securely for them. Banks originated as vaults that held things for a fee. That fee is the revenue model. 
If after a while of making money from fees, as the bank you want to lend your profits from those fees, so be it. Then you'd have 100% reserves and still be able to make loans. The same way average people make loans, from their own pocket!

The supply curve is not in anyway a vertical line of 3600 a day. That's very 9am-4pm market minded. The supply curve is 25 every ten minutes. While results obviously in a diagonal line, no?
You also forget that the price measure is itself a freely floating currency, based on unsound monetary theories. The block reward halving will stand in stark contrast to human fallible supply and may have an impact on price.

You make good points. What you may be missing is the subtleties of bitcoin. 
It's open source, without OS you are very vulnerable to bugs. "A few blockchain knowledgeable people" won't matter. If it's OS they'll be forked to death by their competitors. 
Manufacturing is limited, if they buy all the hardware the value of that hardware will increase and new manufacturers, foreign and domestic, will enter the market. 
They can't use vps or standard hardware because botnets will destroy them, they have to use asics. 
Marketing is of questionable effectiveness. Look at all the marketing in the drug war, and where has that led? DARE increased drug use. Most likely any marketing will pull bitcoin along with it. Plus the "anti-bank" marketing is a decentralized force of itself. See Occupy.

I believe it's nearly impossible even with dedicated resources as I tried to explain. That doesn't mean it won't be attempted. Sure it will. Many will try. But those attempts will ultimately fail, be it a week, a month, or a year after it's launched. All the while bitcoin will keep chugging along and growing. Further, when their competition builds something with Bitcoin and doesn't have to spend all those resources securing and maintaining it, their private ledger will lose.
Private blockchains will have value, but it'll be at the expense of the institutions this op was about. Private blockchains will bolster bitcoin, which will hurt them. They'll just have to find that out on their own I guess.

Technically you can't. Unless someone posts all the keys (like what's happening now). 
A couple of years ago there was a patch that blocks very small txns from being confirmed by the network, because there were some suspicious, and presumed malicious "dust" txns happening. That limit is set at 5430 satoshis or 0.0000543 btc. So all txns need to be above that threshold. Not sure it's still valid. 
Other concerns are people sending bitcoin to themselves (to an address they also control) as a way to create more txns to be confirmed. These usually are not large bc it ties up valuable btc that can't be spent, so likely they would be very small "spam"  like txns. That's my understanding.

Something on the order of 99% of txns happen off chain today. Exchanges, tipping applications, etc. That is a result of free market forces, and is neither positive or negative in and of itself. Additionally, a majority of on chain txns are for less than a dollar$ in value. 
It is very plausible that the number off chain txns will continue to 100x to 1000 greater than on chain txns. Consolidating smaller txns into larger txns will also naturally enable an increase in the txn fee.

That's just one data point, not even a fully fledged argument yet. There are any number of possible and unforeseen innovations that could bring down txns fees for everyday size txns including off-chain use on-chain settlement, and what we see in the next year will give us an idea of its effects. To discount that possibility in favor of a hard line stance, shows little understanding of free markets and history, and hurts your arguments. The fundamentals of bitcoin in the current regard are network effects related and security related, and some code maintenance issues.

The strength of bitcoin is not its anonymity, it's the security, or the inability for others to freeze, steal, or remove access to your money.

One of the things many over look is that fact that people are incentivized to mine to protect their investment. The rich in the world pay a lot in fees to banks, fees to a vault to hold their gold, accountants, and lawyers, the list can go on and on how people today pay to secure their money. It's not beyond the realm of possibility that certain wealthy users of bitcoin will either a) run mining equipment themselves, b) explicitly fund miners, or c) pay higher transaction fees on their own to incentivize mining. 
@_date: 2015-11-13 03:13:21
Marginal cost is almost universally negative at lower production levels. That's where the term 'economies of scale' comes from, MC drops as you produce more units. That doesn't last forever. At a point the MC begins to increase. 


Yes, but that is unpredictable by its nature and you can't build a business plan around that it. That would happen once or twice by accident maybe. Even today there is a noticeable amount of empty blocks, and that doesn't fit your theory. 
At this exact sliver in time, perhaps industrial mining outfits have a very high level of scale advantage, however there is no reason to think this will continue. In fact, there is every reason to believe that it won't, since that is the ordinary way markets and technology evolve. Scale advantages in Bitcoin will likely be mitigated much faster than other markets because of its extraordinary resistance to a unilateral government protection of incumbents. MC for the industry will fall due to advances in technology, management and science, which will end up hurting those first huge industry players since they have become relatively highly invested in outdated hardware and processes.

Depends how you define "gold market". Actual gold market or paper market? If by shear size, like nation states' accounts held in NY or else where, they are supposed to be 100% allocated and stored. Also, there is huge market for private vaults like safety deposit boxes (people pay fees) and private vaults (just Google "private vaults"). They are the vast majority of the gold market out there. 
If you are talking volume traded, like comex, they are 126:1 fractionally backed currently. But trading is not banking. That is the crux of the debate here. I don't think you understand that trading, fractional reserve, etc is not traditional banking.

It is yet to be seen if another blockchain can scale to the size of bitcoin when the world has the awareness of this technology. Theoretically it's possible, but it is a different world than when Satoshi and a handful of people build the early Bitcoin network in relative anonymity. Until another network does that, Bitcoin is unique and has a unique advantage and characteristic. 
I personally think it will be very difficult to do this in today's environment of state and individual cyber warfare. Bitcoin got lucky. Others likely will not. 
@_date: 2015-11-03 07:42:08
Wow, thanks for the detailed and thoughtful answer. My point of my questions was this:
Currently, we have alternative coins with different attributes than bitcoin. We also are all well aware of bitcoin's txn limits. Now then, there are two possibilities for bitcoin, 1) bitcoin won't change, or 2) it will change. 
If 1) is the right answer the situation will be no different from today, so why would the value go down? Alts with different rules are here now, and bitcoin has a low limit. We only avg what, about 500kb to 700kb a block anyway, so we have excess room for usage to go up even, if bitcoin didn't change. If 2) is the correct answer and bitcoin changes its block size limit, then most agree the value will increase.  Either choice the price doesn't necessarily collapse, and probably won't. In fact it could create more incentive to mine because txn fees must increase. 
By my last question I was trying to pull out the realization that there are equally important benefits of bitcoin over alts other than scalability. The fact that it's the largest most secure network, most widely and highly  valued cryotocurrency, and the network effects it enjoys points to a logical conclusion that even if it didn't increase its block size, the 3-7 txns/sec will still be highly valued for those other characteristics. It could become used for high value, low liquidity txns for example.
You may be correct in believing that the TPS limit goes up, but you get to that conclusion falsely it seems.

They are only trading $230,000/day total volume in their newly added coin. That's not going to cut it.

Again you twist it. How many users isn't the issue. That fact that they need to restrict users at all is a result of higher risk resulting in less security. The honey pot is way bigger and consists of insecure data. Bitcoin's blockchain can be open because the data itself is secure, so no need to restrict. Restricting permissions to 5 or 5000 doesn't matter, its the restriction itself that points to a net difference in security.

They don't insure the purchasing power of your deposits. With interest rates about to go negative depositors are shit outta luck man. Meanwhile, the cost of rent and food is exploding.
One off depositors don't need FDIC insurance, bc a bank can just change the balance. FDIC is for systemic problems. If there is a systemic problem today, the Fed will print,  exacerbating your problem of losing purchasing power.

If unsophisticated miners today can invalidate the theory, what will sophisticated miners in a deeper more advanced economy do? I propose they'll break it more.




No, I think I get your point, I just disagree. Yes, miners can harm competitors and benefit themselves with a block, but to do so they increase their risk and lower their overall margins. It is an all or nothing race, and the first one to get their block built upon is the winner. The odds of a huge block that takes a minute to propagate getting built upon is low.

Of course, you shouldn't have to protect your privacy against an agency that is truly concerned about sustaining privacy. Listen to how crazy this sounds.

LE can't stop anything they claim to fight even with help/education. (look absolutely everywhere) It's debatable if they even help statistically at all. In my opiniom, nothing positive can come from the alliance engaging those agencies.

Why would you want to use the second to arrive? That puts you at a disadvantage of finding the next block, because you can't start until the previous block has arrived, right?
You also don't want to waste time on a block that might not be the one everyone else is building on. You don't know that for sure, but game theory tells you that everyone else will build on the first valid block to arrive.

The OP analysis is wrong. Average block size has room to grow. Misleading at best. 
True, off-chain txns are not pure bitcoin txns. True, the number of on-chain txns is growing.  What needs to be understood why they occur off-chain and the cost/benefit to the whole of it. We can't simply say that off-chain is undesirable. If off-chain txns are the free market solution to preserve consensus rules by releasing pressure on the blockchain they are positive in certain respects. Thoughts?

Well, it demonstrates that the blockchain is already viewed by a vast majority of the participants to be a settlement layer, not a txn layer. Whether that trend will continue, and as I suspect increase to 99%, is unknown, but there's definitely not a reason to think a catastrophic halt to the growth in the number of txns is coming.


If so, they can go mine ltc. There is a market reason why they might want that at certain times, and that arbitrage opportunity, or a perceived market imbalance. Not because bitcoin is less attractive fundamentally.

Interesting. That's called where marginal cost equals marginal revenue is the profit maximizing point. However, only the marginal cost is explicitly known in btc mining. The marginal revenue will increase or decrease depending on the users, miners, or developers. 
Do you think the fee amount would act the same way? There is a perceived marginal cost for lower fees, and a marginal revenue in the form of faster txns. There should be a way to estimate that. 
Anyway, good point.

I can see that. Although the govt claims to own all that, too.

Possible. But in every interaction there is a threat of violence and an aquiencence by the civilian (why does it have to be citizen?). ie you have to stop and talk or risk escalation even if you've done nothing, and the legal retaliation for execising free speech in those situations can include resulting in death by the LE. 
While I don't think this is the disease the US suffers from, it is a symptom and will grow worse. The best scenario would be for bitcoin to just keep moving forward and focus on decentralization, and give no regard to LE where possible. Courting them invites trouble for some current centers of innovation (the companies).

Great questions. I'll give you my answers to these, but please research on your own. I'll try and include some links for you. 
1) Not very. However that said, the likelihood of the price increasing in the interim between payment and cash out is just as likely as it is to decrease, which would benefit your clients. If your clients understand the risks they can make more informed decisions themselves. The price has been more stable over the last year or so, but daily swings of 5% are possible. Typical daily volatility is about 2% I'd say off the top of my head. Still beats PayPal. 
The risk can be mitigated by your process. If they set up an account on the exchange of their choice, you could directly fund their account there. Some exchanges have automatic features that could further help.
I don't endorse these, they are just for further research. 
2) Yes. That could be a concern on smaller exchanges. Most exchanges can handle typical "pay check" amounts with no problem at all. But if the amounts you are talking about are "project budget" amounts, there could be issues.
3) Not currently that I know of, but that's a good idea. Bitwage.com might be the closest thing to that.
There are also bitcoin atms popping up everywhere. You could send them btc and they could go to an atm to withdraw the cash. Remember PayPal has fees and atms have fees too (usually 5% or there abouts). Localbitcoins is also an option, they could form a relationship with a person willing to cash them out every couple of weeks or whatever.

It's not priced in. It's true that traders are generally wrong, just like gamblers. They can think they know what's priced in or not, and what exactly the halvening means for value, but there is disagreement among technical experts, expert traders, and even miners.

We know that miner income is currently slightly trending down per Phps, and difficulty is in a relatively flat phase. Therefore, it's a good bet that they hold back only a small percentage of new coins (imo at most 10% and likely &lt;5%). Equipment profitability is decreasing + little new equipment  = approaching their marginal costs. If there are big profits to be made, enough to hold back a lot of new coins from the market that is, there would be room over the last few months for new hashing power to come on line, and it hasn't. 
I'm not in that world though, this is strictly from an economics perspective, but I'd assume most new coins are sold in the futures markets months in advance, too, to hedge against volatility. If that's the case, they'd be able to make fine grained budgets, and hold back more coins off the market. There is also an OTC market that could be where some large lots from miners are sold off. Bottom line, we just don't know.

To paraphrase of their response, "I really like it. It could make us very competitive and look innovative."

With a straight face they'd answer, "Oh no. That's very niche for illegal uses. It's the blockchain that's exciting."

As more nodes are brought online, the harder it is to make them obsolete because they can become a vote against their obsolescence (as in the block size debate). It's a race.

Good point. A chain's token is responsible for the incentive structure. Without a native token their is an incentive problem, participants wouldn't stay honest in the network. And there would be value in trying to undermine the network to wipe your debts (or many other reasons). They'd also have an incentive to only validate blocks that are beneficial to themselves, or mine a different branch of the blockchain that benefits themselves. 
PoS would be a disaster here too. With no token that incentiveses good behavior, you could just write whatever block you want.
