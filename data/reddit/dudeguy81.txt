Gold is a precious metal. It has value because it can be used for all sorts of things from circuit boards to jewelry. It was never practical as a currency because of its rarity and weight which is why it was replaced. Bitcoin, by comparison cannot be crafted into something. It only has value because people trade it. That means it can lose its value at any time as soon as people no longer want to trade for it. You should read the history of tulip mania.

 For me the challenge is the impractical use in business. The price changes so often, so dramatically and so unpredictably that it makes any business use extremely difficult. 
For example, let’s say I run a small business in which I buy cotton and create shirts to be sold online. Because I’m small compared to the large clothing brands I have to keep my margins small to compete and I operate on a 10% margin. So, if I buy 100k worth cotton I expect to generate 10k in profit. 
Now, let’s say it takes my seamstresses a full month to sew the shirts and another week or two to sell them all. That means there’s about a 40 day window between buying the cotton and selling the shirts. If I use USD to buy the cotton and USD when I sell the shirts I can assume the relative value of the cotton and shirts will remain more or less the same during those 40 days. Easy. Money goes out, 40 days later more money comes back in.
But what if I’m using BTC instead? Let’s run that example again. On July 16th I purchase 100k worth of cotton using BTC. At the time BTC was $9,490 per BTC. So that means I spent 10.537 btc on that 100k USD worth of cotton. Fast forward to today, August 20th, and I just finished selling my shirts. The cost of BTC has gone up to $10,745 or an increase of roughly 13%. Remember, I only earn 10% profit but, since the cost of the currency increased by 13% during that short window, my total profit for the entire thing was -3%. 
Obviously this example is super simplified for the purposes of making a point. How are we supposed to use BTC in business while it is so volatile? Until BTC stabilizes relative to the other currencies in the world I think it’s future will remain uncertain.

Another responder had a similar message. I’m curious when you expect the value of a BTC to level off? To me it’s an investment, and something you can use for a transaction but only if you want to convert it to a traditional currency to guarantee they value is retained. Until it reaches that point you’re talking about I just don’t see it becoming much more than that.

I assume they sell the product they buy almost as soon as they acquire it according to every drug movie ever.
