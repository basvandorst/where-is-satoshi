How you prevent that? like say you have a bunch of btc and eventually the fork happens, what then? you lose your money forever? what happened to those coins you had?


Problem I have is that a lot of these coins look good in the surface but then theres a lot of info they wont share and only later on you hear it was a mess, like ether for example

Thats the problem, there has to be a way I could do something with it to get my money back instead, shorting?

I made that money
@_date: 2016-08-17 21:56:40
It would have to reach $950 or so to get my money back

Don't you mean the other way around?

You think is the same hacker from twitter? the wormz guy?

Thats insane, they might not even last that long.
Anyway, so what are some long-and-steady options then? seriously man I'm open to any ideas as long as it works

Isn't russia the only country that wont deport him back to america?

Wouldn't making a wallet then erasing the .dat but keep the seed written in a paper be more secure? or keeping the dat in an offline medium?


Which would you recommend?


I don't know, what if bitfinex goes bankrupt or something? what then?
