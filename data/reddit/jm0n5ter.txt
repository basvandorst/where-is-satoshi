Well shit I've been searching for the past week to find this answer... I even had the idea of opening up a non profit, yet that failed once I discovered more details. Even thought about buying gold with btc. Your info would be appreciated.

Thanks for your response, there's a lot of mix information on the web so I'm just trying to shine the light on what's true. I'm gonna have to reach out to Giovanni's office or something and see if I can hear this from the horses mouth.

I appreciate your feed back ����
I'm probably gonna end up moving there very soon.
I was watching another trader posting his experience on YouTube.  He stated that 0% capital gains starts when you sign your lease there I wonder how true that is I'll provide a link below.

I'm planning on holding on to some btc for long term. Yet I need to cash in some profits so I can change my current living situation.

the laws seem to be pretty clear you can live in PR and benefit from the perks ... 
Act 22
Known as “The Individual Investors Act”, the main focus of this law is to attract individual investors and promote that they relocate to the Island. How? With total exemption from local income taxes on all passive income from the point they become legal bona fide Puerto Rican residents. These new residents of Puerto Rico receive 100% exemption on dividends, interest on capital gains. Although Puerto Rico is a U.S. territory, pursuant to Section 933 of the U.S. Internal Revenue Code of 1986, Puerto Rico residents are not subject to federal income taxes derived from sources within the Island, they only subject to those derived from external sources.

@_date: 2019-04-25 02:57:52
so even if i comply with the laws in PR , because i am i citizen of the USA i still have to pay those taxes ? .... is that a certainty ? excuse my ignorance.
@_date: 2019-04-25 18:06:59
well so far i have done some more digging and i have come across this information, (ill post it below)  seems like its legit.  if by the right tree you mean gold... well that is a solid plan yet selling off all that gold for cash seems like a pain. the idea is to get as much profit as possible and pump into rental properties.
