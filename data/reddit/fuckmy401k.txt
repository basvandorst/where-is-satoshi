Have people come to you asking for the Data you've collected ?

It's a 1 Billion Dollar Parachute.  
They keep the patents from their Research &amp; sell them to Big Pharma. 
I'm not against the hospital. 
But you can see how one hospital (that spends an insane amount on advertising and has a billion dollar surplus ) is in very good shape &amp; others without any safety net are barely staying open? 
Are they losing CHIP? No. 
They have every right to ask for donations. It's the law. 
But this is like Harvard asking for donations vs Inner City Schools.

St Judes = not struggling 
Many Childrens Hospitals = struggling

Children's Hospital Los Angeles. 
They'll be losing CHP  , and most of the children suffer from hunger on top of medical issues ( cancer &amp; other diseases) 
Many children there are foster children. 
DM me for a contact there .

9 Billion Dollar expansion.  
I've seen Children's Hospitals in poor cities (especially ones with undocumented citizens ) close down because of lack of funding. 
St Judes has patients. They can afford to pay celebrities to do their commercials. 
They have Best Buy &amp; Major partners &amp; they own patents on their research.  
California is losing CHIP (places like CHLA will cut back on doctors &amp; services because of this).  I'm just saying both are charities - they do good work - one might need more help than they other.

Thanks. I won't lie. Sometimes I feel alone in standing for this stuff. 
I'd rather help sick / starving kids in areas that need help than add to a surplus.  This is crypto , shouldn't be that weird - I think. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:30:58
St Judes has tons of money (over 1 Billion ) and very few inpatient beds. There are hospitals struggling to keep their doors open. 
Sorry for being blunt , but I grew up very poor and I'd rather see the hospitals fighting to stay alive get money ( they also do research)

I think two of the top 15 exchanges of BTC are based in China &amp; a ton of mines are based there as well. 
It literally costs China nothing to shut them down, re-open them with control &amp; regulations , and when they re-open the corrupt government workers and their supporters world wide will have bought a massive amount of currency at a low rate. 
@_date: 2017-09-21 23:32:10
1. Disagree. Think about undocumented workers in the US.  They pay for everything in cash. 
2. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 04:27:22
dumb. 
Kim's inner circle controls the majority of the money and that's about the size of a CPR class at a community college. 
If there's any situation with NK , Kim won't be fleeing to live on an island. At the very least he'll be put on trial and imprisoned - but he'll likely get killed.
If anything BTC could be a smart/nice way to bribe Kim's inner circle for a coup.
PS : Kim's biggest asset = outsourced slavery &amp; natural resources (which NK sits on) .

Looking at the order books 
it looks like this is fake news for a pump
people are selling small portions of BTC right now 
and in a downturn that use means that they're bots/day traders pump &amp; dumping off of the rumors
@_date: 2017-09-21 17:18:25
maybe long term NEO will be big and I don't have a strong enough feel on the Crypto Markets evaluations on it 
but everything I've seen go into China to make $$$$ has ended up taking a half decade or longer to get there or (as in most cases) has failed.

Wish my previous two girlfriends had hardware wallets that would keep them from taking their credit cards out so Target wouldn't hack all of our money away...

Not advising anyone of this. But before China even happened I've had two different people say that (based on head &amp; shoulders / fib )  they thought that $3600 would be a projected point for a drop once it peaked.

Korean/Asian whales are going to create a bump in hopes of Americans getting paid on Friday and then they'll probably drop it all at a certain point (3800? ) 
We did that to them a couple of weeks ago.

If you look at how people under 50 have handled credit cards, car loans, etc it could be an influx of madness added to the Crypto market which continues cycles like the one we've seen.

Very doubtful. Hope you don't mind the honesty bat. 
1. In the US , economics isn't required education in high schools and in the schools that require it - it's pretty much a watered down workbook version of it.  
2.  Many college and high school students live in households where parents didn't invest into the market outside of stock options that came with working at a company (ie retail ) .  A lot of countries that have attracted Crypto have high single parent/single income families too ( US is one and it's growing )  
3.  And unfortunately outside of the US this is even scarier. I think that most people who enter the market in sections....will not be disciplined enough in modern economics 
That being said , I think the evaluations for Crypto are smart. 
No one is talking about how the markets/banks being shitty or failing will only help Crypto and it's looking like we're heading towards an endless amount of issues coming up
@_date: 2017-09-22 01:51:24
There are other positives to having crypto if you're undocumented though.  
Think of how many students are in the US that can't open up bank accounts &amp; what their fees are for their parents to send them $$$.

I could write a book about my complaints with Gemini but

note - i'd look at 3300-3200 as a good buying point.  Whales seem to enjoy that discount area.
@_date: 2017-09-22 07:17:40
If it helps your blood pressure we've had multiple pauses at around 3700 in the past 100 days.  Even in the dips the median would be in the 3700s.  
Note : I haven't had access to orders various exchanges , but if you have 0 bitcoin right now and are hoping to buy 4-5 in the next 48 hours , spread it out in spots.

If you think about the social issues of the US . 
Leftists : Hate the big banks 
Far Right : Hate the Fed
Black &amp; Latin Minorities : Hate the Government 
Immigrants : Have a hard time opening bank accounts and have small businesses that only take Cash. 
Probably 50% of the country could be interested in BTC.  Especially if BTC is gaining worldwide value

I'm old enough to remember E*Trade fucking up the markets more than helping.  The problem is that the behavioral economics of new investors is pretty standard - they invest too much early out of FOMO and when it drops they pussy out because they're afraid of it biting them big.  
@_date: 2017-09-15 05:44:51
my biggest fear with China (to some degree) is that they're being bribed to have 1-2 parties become the limited crypto of China.  NEO is def in play for that , maybe BCC is the other?

I had a discussion with a 75 year old bank manager today about Crypto. 
He said that he saw it coming in the late 90s/early 00s before he retired. 
His son was a huge collector of Fantasy &amp; Pokemon cards and ended up trading 4 of his cards for a Playstation. One year he saw four kids who had flown overseas to go to a convention for WoW and he knew that a worldwide currency was bound to happen at the start of the internet. 
Basically - whether intentional or not - the under 40 generation via gig culture , credit card point trades, and other forms won't mind that they are sacrificing the current USD.

Sent a wire to buy crypto the other week via Citibank. 
To note , I send &amp; receive wires over 5k commonly ( 8-10 a month). 
The call was basically to inquire if I knew what CryptoCurrency was and to give me an explanation of the dangers.  
Moved my money to my Fidelity account where people there ask me what I'm buying in Crypto.

 I have a feeling that the corruption in China would want to keep NEO at ATL allowing GOVT officials in on the corruption to buy it before the ban is over &amp; it goes right back up again.
My friend's father worked in the textile industry over there and explained how officials would double dip is low sells and high buys all the time
@_date: 2017-09-18 03:18:05
To some extent China "banning" Crypto is great for the US.  
Their people sold off their crypto at bargain basement prices to us and now China owns less Crypto than the US. 
It'd be smart to buy as much as possible so when they want to get back in the game they are going to have to get it at Top Shelf prices. 
@_date: 2017-09-25 18:17:15
I think a huge issue with this is that 1 BITCOIN = 4,000. 
And converting this into your currency is a bit like asking people to convert to the metric system.  
If I saw the price of gas was 0.000767 BTC , I'd be tempted. But unlike the US dollar.... 0.000767 can be 4 bucks or 5 bucks every hour.
