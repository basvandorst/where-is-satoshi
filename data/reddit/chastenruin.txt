Larger transactions make the fees lower as a percentage of the total transaction.  If you're moving $20k in BTC and paying a $15 network, that's almost nothing.  It's almost worth paying more for the priority.  If you're paying 25% to withdraw your money from an ATM that's straight up thievery.
Also, ATM's have a daily withdrawal limit.
The other difference is ATM and bank networks are mature and robust and bitcoin is still a nascent technology and just now becoming mainstream.  The probability that fees remain so high moving into the future is very low.  Bank and ATM fees keep rising over time, while bitcoin fees should go down as more capacity is added and technical solutions are implemented.

Only those who benefit from government services (taxpayers, businesses) are charged taxes.  Our government doesnt charge citizens in other countries taxes unless they are US citizens.  The benefits of society stretch far and wide.  
We pay fees for transactions through exchanges because we use the infrastructure.  It's a collective benefit for all bitcoiners and all bitcoiners pay to support it through each transaction.  Otherwise there is no incentive for those miners to support the network and confirm transactions.

2.  They are granting forked coins.  When I need to move those coins, I'll use a hardware wallet.  But keeping them on a hardware wallet puts the liability on me.  If I lose them, I lose them.  If Coinbase loses them, I still keep whatever their insured limit is.  I am more protected, legally, by putting the liability on them.  And their backers have deep pockets.

Bitcoin eliminates the middle men and market manipulators.  It makes the books transparent so they cant be cooked.

@_date: 2017-09-20 03:34:57
My reasoning was:
Liquidity (assuming you have a reputable exchange):  I can buy or sell btc at any time.  I can convert it into any local currency I want.  I can even use it directly with some vendors.  I also dont have to wait 5 days for a clearinghouse to make the money accessible.
Appreciation.  BTC has a finite upper limit and this restricted supply means demand should therefore increase given increased adoption.  Even further, this increased demand coupled with depreciating value in other fiat currencies should continue to drive it's valuation.  A year ago, BTC was at around $800.  Would you ever get that kind of return on silver or gold?
Tradeability.  One of the positive sides of btc being volatile is your ability to make money flipping it and moving some of that profit into other currencies.  Heck, you could even buy gold and silver with the profits just to put your mind at ease.
Portability.  Do you have a private militia to help you transport your physical silver to the bank in order to get cash back in return?  How much can you realistically carry and secure?  With btc you can carry around billions in your pocket like a Bond villain and nobody is the wiser.  And again its instantly convertible and tradeable.  It's even better than carrying diamonds as far as physically moving assets is concerned.
Sure, there are risks with the exchange you use, the stability of crypto itself and its entirely possible you might lose everything.  But that same possibility exists for the global market, and arguably, a nuclear North Korea at this point scares me more than a btc collapse.

@_date: 2017-10-04 22:57:09
You get liability protection on an exchange.  And any payment service that converts cash to BTC in order to pay bills would fill a niche in the market.
There are going to be banks and payment providers that step into this opportunity allowing you to get your paycheck in BTC and pay all your bills with it.  
Truthfully, given how quickly BTC is appreciating in price, at this point you're better off converting your cash to BTC rather than letting it sit in savings earning a paltry 0.25% interest or nothing at all in your checking account.
You're missing the original point though.  Sure, its currently a pain to transfer BTC and the fees are currently high, but with more mainstream expansion and legitimacy those fees will get reduced through competition and ultimately however you decide to pay your bills and which currency you use is inconsequential.  The fact is, the vendor might prefer to receive BTC than paper cash and may decide to eat those fees because the appreciation of BTC outstrips that of any other currency or commodity.
@_date: 2017-10-04 19:48:33
I'm asking if increased transaction volume builds mainstream legitimacy, not if you feel comfortable buying and selling with BTC.  I dont want to spend my BTC either at this point but it appears that the skepticism in the broader market of accepting it as a legitimate currency is directly related to the lack of transaction volume or the dubious nature of existing transactions.
Whether you pay your bills in fiat, or fiat converted to BTC doesnt really matter, but showing the ability to process transactions and scaling that volume up shows its a real currency being used for legitimate purposes and not just another investment vehicle traded by speculators or the currency of anarchists, thieves and hackers.

It's surprising, because I figured theyd give an option for users to convert their forked BCH to ETH/LTC/BTC so they wouldnt have to worry about liquidity and covering the BTC's people would potentially withdraw. That tells me they had the BTC in reserve to be able to handle a run, a run they advised their own customers to take.

AOL squandered the biggest opportunity of a lifetime.  They could have been Google, Facebook, Netflix and Spotify all at once after they bought Time Warner.  They had a walled garden, a search engine, a large userbase, the rights of one of the largest media catalogs in the world, a full fledged ISP and a bunch of community driven chatboards and sections that could have morphed into Facebook.  They had no idea what they had.  There was no vision at the top.

My basic research says your placement costs for each location would be around $12k-$14k.  $7K is for the machine itself, then youve gotta populate it with cash and BTC.  Dont forget insurance on the machine.  In the US youd have to register with FinCen as an MSB and follow their regulations but once you get a system in place and get past that hurdle it would just be a matter of finding new placements and getting new equipment or arranging some kind of contract with the shop owner where they cover part of the startup and get a certain percentage.
But the rates I'm seeing are 8% returns on exchanges and 5% on buying.

The better opportunity might be investing in BTC ATM's and getting them placed in liquor stores and tobacco shops.  Imagine what you could make with just the service charge alone.  You would also be making a killing exchanging that cash for BTC assuming your buy price was lower than the exchange price.
I was flirting with mining but the ATM seems to be a stronger opportunity.

I've been investing in BTC for about a year now.  So I'm not an expert or anything, but from what I'm seeing it appears that this kind of situation is a good thing for BTC as a whole.  I keep thinking that the critical element BTC needs for mainstream legitimacy is more transaction volume on the blockchain.  Buying and selling speculative investments is just moving coins from one wallet to the next in return for fiat and taking place mainly on the exchanges and this is the majority of activity currently taking place.  Now we need to throw transaction volume on the chain, the buying and selling of legitimate goods and services, at a level and speed that matches current networks for payment processing in order to get mainstream acceptance.
Can someone more informed than me illuminate this issue of mainstream acceptance for me?

If the sale is in bitcoin directly, dont you just have to pay the sales tax based on the valuation of the house/good/item in USD on the day of the sale?  The capital gains tax shouldnt apply because you're basically making a trade and havent realized your gain.  You're still invested in the asset when you transfer it, you've just traded it for a house/good/item.

My grandparents literally bought and buried physical gold in their backyard.  They even called my dad and I to help them dig the hole.  I could not stop laughing about it the entire day.  My grandpa was not amused with me in the slightest.

The sales taxes make sense based on valuation on the date of purchase.  If I sold my house for gold, I expect to pay the sales tax and I'd report the valuation of the gold on the purchase date as my cost basis until I sold my gold where I'd expect to pay capital gains assuming it appreciated.  When I sold my house later for cash or BTC, I'd of course be on the hook for the capital gains on the increased valuation of the house at time of sale.
The capital gains shouldnt kick in though if youre not technically realizing a gain or loss (selling it).  If I sold the gold or BTC to make the purchase, then it makes sense, but if I traded the BTC or gold directly for a House, then it doesnt seem like I should get nailed for capital gains.  Now, if the buyer immediately sells the btc or gold for cash, he should be subjected to taxes.
