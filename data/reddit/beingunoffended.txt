He was talking about the flaws of Christian Socialism, which he saw as unrealistic an faith-based. For the most part, he and Marx were lock-step on almost everything. In fact he co-authored most works for which Marx is primarily known. 


I have read it, and perhaps you have as well. Clearly one of us only heard what they wanted to hear...

You seem to think that these things aren't related... 
As if when government is given absolute economic power, those who seek that power would not inevitably include those who would abuse it. As it turns out - *here in the real world* - government won't just go away (even if you ask really nice) after you've ceded to it the power to plan your life.

but if comrade Bernie did a Socialism it would work!!!

right, they just did a socialism wrong. if *I* - a paragon of benevolence and virtue - were to have done a socialism, it would have worked. /s

Dude are you high? Socialism a centrist ideology... you keep riding that fucking rainbow bud.

Social Democracy =/= Democratic Socialism...
Social Democracy isn't Socialist; rather it describes any country with a robust welfare-scheme, predicated a Free-Market Capitalist economy and funded by taxes levied with in said system. 
Socialism (democratic or otherwise) describes a *mode of production* in which the Means of Production are publicly (government) owned, limits are placed on trade and exchange and resources are managed by a central power. 
These are fundamentally incompatible socioeconomic/political ideologies... The welfare programs offered in successful Social Democracies *could not exist in the absence of a capitalist environment*. They are successful because of Capitalism, not inspite of it.

Socialism is short for *Socialist-Mode of Production*, an intermediary stage in Communist theory. During this stage Government co-ordinates collectivization efforts and resource allocation via central planning. Eventually - in theory - once collective institutions and allocations processes are well-established, government intervention is scaled back and ownership is handed over to the producers. This transition is the movement from Socialism to Communism.
See: 'Socialism: Utopian and Scientific' by  Friedrich Engels
I swear to god, if half the population of self-described Socialists would bother to read Socialist-Communist theory...

Like I said, I'm not going to argue if you're not willing to be honest. This statement for example this is a mischaracterization commonly used by socialists to paint every government provided service as indicative of socialism. Roads aren't socialist, public schools aren't socialist, etc. they are welfare polices designed to lower market entry barriers in a capitalist system. Socialism is, as I've said predicated upon a socialist economy. 
peace.

I didn't say he wasn't... the "scientific socialism" he was espousing was that transitional model [socialist-mode → communism], as opposed to a religious-based view. He and Marx believed that history demonstrated that people are more willing to accept massive changes to their way of life if the changes occur over long periods of time rather than via upheaval - which often faces violent opposition. While that observation is certainly true, the fact remains; the socialism model has never successful produced the outcomes they sought to. Unfortunately, many socialists are still essentially religious-zelots , adhering to a verifiably, observable pernicious set of ideals.

You're mistaken...
In Socialist-Communist theory, the *Socialist-Mode of Production*, or more commonly *Socialism*,  is predicated upon public ownership of the means of production. During this stage, profit distribution, trade, labor, and resource allocation are coordinated by the State. However, in most ideological iterations, the Socialist-Mode is intended to be an intermediary stage.
The idea; government is used to de-establish private-ownership, and market resource allocation, collectivize industry, stabilize price schemes (etc.). Then at some pre-determined point, government intervention is progressively scaled back... this transitions into the Communist-Mode which is as you described it: 


It is for this same reason we call the Soviet Model "Soviet Socialism" (because it was) rather than Communism (because it wasn't). The Soviets *were* Communists, but their economic model was Socialist. Communism is the ultimate goal of Socialism, however; no-one has ever successfully made the transition out of Socialism. In most cases - if economic collapse doesn't happen first - the power required to establish allocation efforts has inevitably lead to rampant political corruption.

Alright, bud you keep riding that rainbow. Who am I to disagree with a Catholic as to the validity of their interpretation of the Bible, or a Socialist with their interpretation of their religious texts? 
@_date: 2018-08-02 16:18:27
okay bud... because it's not if the founding documents of the ideology. This is why no one likes Socialists; they can't have an honest conversation about their own belief-system.

Marvel trying to keep their comics relevant. It's funny, DC's movies suck but they're killing it in ink, Marvel's comics suck but they're knocking doors down at theaters.

I didn't say "socialism inherently leads to communism" - it clearly does not, otherwise there would be extant communist societies - I said communism is the goal of socialism. That is an objective reality of the Socialist dogma. 
@_date: 2018-08-02 14:02:26
yeah, well it has been marketed that way - I don't disagree - but it isn't true in the slightest.
