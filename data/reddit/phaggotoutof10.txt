Then why has there been 3 individual forks within the past 3 months or so? Is it not possible to implement them at the same time?

So essentially there's a bitcoin 1% that has more sway on a fork than the 99% of holders and thus can manipulate bitcoin?

Yes but the more bitcoin you have, the more power you have. Thus we essentially have a 1% controlling bitcoin for the 99%.

What's stopping an elite group of holders such as a 1% backing a fork purely for monetary gain?

But the affect on the market is always the same, because people buy btc before they even know the value of the forked coin. Most people will take even a free 1% on their portfolio if it's available.

Because every time a fork is announced it increases the price at unsustainable levels. As well as that it deflates the value of good alt coin technologies.

But the weight of a vote is influenced on the amount of btc you hold. The value of the forked currency isn't my concern. I'm concerned about the fact that any btc fork whether it be shit or not dramatically increases btc prices at an absurd rate and suppresses alts.

But the impact is hyperinflation and a potential crash. If a group or government agency pooled together trillions of dollars to buy a massive share of the market, they could crash it and render it useless, no?

So BTC is decentralized* rather than actually decentralized?

Then why aren't there multiple forks everyday? Where do people vote for forks?
