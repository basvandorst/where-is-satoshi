No, I mean pretty much all bitcoin is owned by a small contingency of people.
@_date: 2018-01-01 17:04:46
Bitcoin is controlled by a few private players making powerful decisions.

The entire title is delusional dreck

"Worth" "1.9 billion"
For being all about economics, you sure don't get why market cap is a poor estimate of how much you could realisticallt get for your toy.

You're right, bubbles are mathematically impossible in this new paradigm ;-)

People's delusions are very resilient.

Markets are delusional if people believe McAfee, lol.

This.  I tried the process of finding IRL identities from online accounts and, well it's not too hard and is exceptionally easier the more content a person posts.
This is probably my ~20th account since 2011 or so.

Lol, btc people are delusional.
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:29:21
You guys are really delusional about what bitcoin is and what it can do.
@_date: 2017-12-28 03:14:04
Yep, people who are really into bitcoin = super detached from reality, lol.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:28:28
Markets can remain delusional longer than most expect.
@_date: 2018-02-03 21:28:53
That's incredibly poor moral logic, and you're using it to *justify* theft.  You're justifying criminality right now.
@_date: 2018-02-06 00:04:59
There's actually not.  You're seeing phantoms, phantoms of bullshit someone spun to pretend bitcoin is actually a revolution.
@_date: 2018-02-05 13:24:58
No it won't.
@_date: 2018-02-04 22:29:15
Or the installers tried surfing on a wave not realizing the tide was going out and will regret it.
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:38:46
I'll take the bargain because I'll be right.
@_date: 2018-02-06 00:01:06
No, I'm just a human being with common sense and a solid background in economic reasoning.  Which appears to be in short supply around bitcoiners.
@_date: 2018-02-06 00:23:05
So what you have is a nice *theory* that works out well in *theory*.  And I understand the math behind it.
Bitcoin is *not* that theory.  It's built on the same tech, but doesn't accomplish the goals you're pretending it does.  Right now, it's literally only used as a vehicle for massive speculation and scamming.  And no amount of good technology will change that it's what Bitcoin effectively is.
Also blockchain is a good technology, that can very well be implemented without using Bitcoins.
@_date: 2018-02-06 00:12:02
I never argued it was worth $0, and I don't need a "technical manual" to understand anything new.
I just argued that Bitcoin will NOT be revolutionary, that the world's financial systems and governments are going to move forward as they always have.  I don't think you have any good argument for why it should do that.
@_date: 2018-02-03 19:24:21
So the original purpose of Bitcoin was tax fraud.
Got it!
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:28:51
Will you guys be humble too when it turns out bitcoin is not revolutionary?
