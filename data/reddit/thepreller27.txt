It's the end of the world because there are people who were buying Bitcoin north of 10k. When you're at an ATH there aren't any people with long positions that lost cash.

Without a use case a bubble will form.

I don't get why this is an issue. Litecoin has been piggybacking on the Bitcoin brand for years calling themself the silver to Bitcoin's gold and no one ever had a problem.

It still rides off the branding of Bitcoin. Go to Charlie Lee's Twitter ( You'll see all the support for Bitcoin and comparing of Litecoin and Bitcoin as being a team. Even the trade abbreviations are similar (BTC/LTC).

Would've been gold if the first message was sent in 2008.

Not necessarily. Graphics cards are way overbought right now and the saturation in mining means people may not want to pay $1000+ for a graphics card

We are only 7% above the 24 hour mark. This may not be over yet

You guys do understand that banks have to issue their financial statements for review? There are no secret Billions that JP Morgan has that they're using to trade crypto.

Bitcoin is a fraud? Who's running the scam? Anyone can mine Bitcoin, anyone can buy Bitcoin. It's a utopian idea which challenges the establishment. Fiat is a scam, it is on a constant downward trend every single year. Could you imagine someone pitched you USD the same way they do an investment. Dollars have zero cap and will continue to lose value every day making you poorer every year.

We are coming close to the limits of silicon chips. 7nm will only be introduced from June onwards (likely) and once that hits the market that's that. Silicon doesn't have properties that can do more or at least not that we've developed. Mining for 6 months you'd get back your ROI on any of the current Antminers so risk is minimal.

Electricity costs about 20% of your profit which means past ROI (the actual risk is getting there) you're buying Bitcoin at an 80% discount. The hate for miners is astounding. You can't exist without us.

It's rather simple. Bitcoin can decrease in value and If it's lower than where you bought you're at an unrealised lose. Mining is linear. It's predictable. You are always making something after staking capital upfront. Whether it's $10 a day or $20 a day is the only real variation you're going to see. I'm not at all saying it's safe. I don't mine Bitcoin. But that's the logic of mining. We could see a bear market in Bitcoin in a few weeks and the guy who's mining can just direct his miner at another token that's doing better and sustain income. It's not an issue that needs to he complicated at all. Miners are protected from massive pull backs (like what we're probably gonna see pretty soon). The only reason to turn your Asic off is if electricity is higher than profit. Something which is extremely unlikely. If everyone shared your logic your BTC would be worth nothing. (Not all mining operations are so high spec. I can run 10 miners in my garage and my only costs are electricity and AC.)

But there is no guarantee that Bitcoin would've increased in value. This is the real argument. If I buy a Bitcoin at $1000 and another guy gets that same Bitcoin mining it (and can continue to mine more). Than if Bitcoin is flat or decreases in value the guy who buys Bitcoin has lost money. The guy who mined it is just making less.

Took all my money out, realised they have the same address as Bitsea, the last Ponzi that shut down. Time to hodl my Bitcoin! 
@_date: 2017-10-25 17:26:01
Well no it isn't, otherwise all Bitcoin would be worthless seeing as no miners would process transactions. Electricity eats about 20% of the profit (on the high end of pricing).

Mining is a more full proof method for profit and protects the investor from bear markets seeing as you still mine tokens which you could either sell for less or just hold. An investment can go south, I for one don't feel comfortable buying Bitcoins north of $5000. If you mine though everything is money once you pass ROI and the only massive risk is a new improved miner hitting the market.
