Very incorrect. Circle is promoting the use of bitcoin as an interoperable payment rails to move money BETWEEN services.
That's why when someone sends you a payment via Circle, when you pick it up, they give you the option of picking it up as bitcoin at a DIFFERENT bitcoin service (e.g. Coinbase, Uphold etc)
@_date: 2015-12-02 00:00:05
Incorrect. You can enter your personal BTC address and pick up that BTC payment from Circle without having an account at Circle, Coinbase or any other BTC service.
Check and mate... 
What else you got, token_dave?
@_date: 2015-12-04 00:30:10
Yup 100%, been a Circle user and supporter since day 1.
@_date: 2015-12-04 00:31:46
Circle's mobile app is a thing of beauty
@_date: 2015-06-29 14:31:03
Hey there, I've used them for almost all of my transactions for the last year. Haven't had any issues, and I like not having to pay 2% whenever I buy then sell BTC...
Just curious what was your issue with them?
@_date: 2015-12-04 00:33:50
I love how token_dave just loves shitting on Circle so much that even on a purely Coinbase-oriented discussion thread, he manages to bash Circle in THREE separate postings. Geez, guy's got a grudge (or works for a competitor).
@_date: 2015-12-04 01:57:24
Funny I am working on Bitcoin too... Even though I don't work at or have an investment at Circle (actually you might say the projects I am working on are competitive with Circle's consumer products), I can appreciate the great things that they and other consumer companies like Coinbase and Fold etc are doing for the ecosystem.
@_date: 2015-12-01 23:51:06
lol token_dave, wrong again. Circle is promoting the use of bitcoin as an interoperable payment rails to move money BETWEEN services.
That's why when someone sends you a payment via Circle, when you pick it up, they give you the option of picking it up as bitcoin at a DIFFERENT bitcoin service (e.g. Coinbase, Uphold etc)
@_date: 2015-06-29 14:46:14
It's a tradeoff. Many people hold their private keys but manage to lose their BTC anyway due to security issues, theft, hardware damage, etc. Blockchain is known for many software issues that result in customers losing BTC. On the other hand, you do have some measure of "control" over your coins.
I find it easier to trust my BTC with a company that has raised a ton of VC money from credible US companies (around $70mm I think, one of them is Goldman Sachs) and that also insures BTC deposits with a third-party insurance company.
@_date: 2014-10-29 14:22:26
credit card fraud. even with evidence the BTC were delivered there can still be a chargeback that is unrecoverable
@_date: 2014-10-29 14:13:36
you're probably right. a newly launched service is coming under a lot of stress from fraudsters looking to take advantage. for every 10 fraudsters their strict checks are blocking there's a few innocent users (like OP i assume) who inadvertently get caught in the net.
i completely agree with you though that if OP is innocent, this is unacceptable. but i'm sure it's something they are working hard to fix by tweaking the way they screen users.
@_date: 2014-09-29 15:57:41
looks like it is back
@_date: 2014-09-29 15:58:58
looks like it is back now
@_date: 2014-09-26 20:49:38
i guess you chose to ignore the 1% coinbase fee, which is worth an additional  ~$4 on the coinbase price in this case
all in, circle = $401.74, coinbase = $402.93
@_date: 2014-09-29 14:32:27
yeah i wonder if maybe before circle raised 26mm from some very prominent VC investors, this question also came up. nah, you probably understand the risks a lot better than the management team and investors
@_date: 2014-09-29 15:57:13
...and it's back
@_date: 2014-10-03 15:09:54
this is definitely true. unfortunately their biggest cost of goods is napkins and those free limes they leave out for anyone to take next to their soda stations. that's basically akin to bitcoin seigniorage costs

pretty cool -- wish I had an android phone
@_date: 2015-05-01 18:26:47
Agree, sounds like a positive experience
@_date: 2015-07-04 05:54:07
I have a hard on for making easy money off idiots like yourself
@_date: 2015-07-02 00:17:52
I don't really understand your comment ("nicer bunch of assholes"?), but I'm willing to take the bet. Should we look at a 1 year forward window (that would mean Circle would have lasted more than twice as long as Trucoin)?
I win $10 if Circle is around and perfectly functional in 1 year, otherwise you win $10? I'm also willing to increase this bet to up to $200.
@_date: 2016-09-19 20:33:14
Fully agree, I've been using it a lot and this is the type of easy to use feature built right into iMessage that people can adopt easily

@_date: 2015-04-22 01:46:01
I saw another thread saying this too, but I just did a send off of circle an hour ago and just tried another one now... no issues.
@_date: 2015-04-22 01:45:24
Not sure what you're talking about. Just did a send off of circle an hour ago and just tried another one now... no issues.
@_date: 2015-04-22 03:55:23
Funny, I did the opposite. Coinbase screwed me over multiple times trying to buy tiny amount of bitcoin, now use Circle 100% of the time and no issues.
@_date: 2015-04-23 01:44:08
They don't have a spread, nor do they have fees. If you think their rate is high, you're free to sell into it, without paying any fees. It's great!
@_date: 2015-04-23 01:47:46
You need to send the right amount of BTC. Not of USD.
Everyone in the Bitcoin world has different exchange rates. Bitfinex, Bitstamp, Coinbase, Circle -- they all use different rates.
So just because overstock says they are charging you $10 USD, Circle may not see it as $10. That's generally because Bitpay's rates are always lower than the mid-market rate.
So you should just send the amount of BTC that overstock/bitpay tells you to. Don't use the USD amount.
@_date: 2015-09-21 20:54:14
I might be... I'm still trying to understand why this is better than a regular computer set up to buy/sell Bitcoin from exchanges?
@_date: 2015-09-21 20:01:42
I'd rather just buy $399.99 worth of Bitcoin...
@_date: 2015-09-22 06:23:16
You're a smart one... Of course I do, I own a lot of BTC.
When great companies like Circle and Coinbase succeed, BTC succeeds.
@_date: 2015-09-21 20:41:47
Yes fully agree with you... 21's computer is a waste of money
@_date: 2015-09-17 19:35:15
Yeah you're right, these idiots raised funding to launch a business and are now trying to generate a return for shareholders. Who does that? /s
@_date: 2015-09-21 21:24:02
Thanks for parroting 21's (shitty) marketing fluff back at me
@_date: 2015-09-17 21:28:34
token_dave, believe it or not, your particular narrow-minded views on bitcoin (i.e. that bitcoin and "centralized fiat payment companies" are incompatible) are not shared by all the participants in the bitcoin ecosystem. I want to see bitcoin succeed and I also want to see services like Circle, which I view as a best-in-class consumer on-ramp to bitcoin, succeed.
@_date: 2015-09-22 16:07:05
Yes, not related to circle.com. I've confirmed this
@_date: 2015-09-24 15:54:31
Try that argument with the NYDFS
@_date: 2015-09-22 16:34:26
Except that Circle can actually move fiat around via bank/credit card/debit card. Also that funds are backed by real USD at a bank and which are FDIC insured on a per user basis.
@_date: 2015-09-22 06:11:43
Or, Circle is joining a whole host of other bitcoin companies in providing wallets pegged to USD: Coinbase, Changetip, OKLink, Bitreserve. Good try scaremongering again, token_dave
@_date: 2015-09-21 20:51:02
Yes, but then what would be the point of the 21 Computer and its super special Bitcoin mining chip?
@_date: 2015-09-21 20:56:16
Bingo, this is exactly right!

@_date: 2015-09-17 19:36:43
Honest token_dave: businesses exist to promote ideologies, not generate returns for shareholders
@_date: 2015-09-22 06:09:07
Awesome... joining a great bunch of companies who've done similar in recent months: Coinbase, OKLink, Changetip, etc
@_date: 2015-09-22 05:17:54
Wait till you actually try the app... beautiful UI
@_date: 2015-09-21 20:48:13
why through a 21 Computer and not through a Normal, Everyday Computer that can do all of the same things and a ton more?
@_date: 2015-09-23 02:51:40
You are wrong, Circle is FDIC insured: 
@_date: 2015-09-17 19:38:49
Right, if you don't subscribe to a specific ideology around Bitcoin, you shouldn't participate in the space /s
@_date: 2015-09-21 20:42:49
Why can't these devices buy bitcoin from an exchange? Many hardware wallets are incorporating this ability already
@_date: 2015-04-22 03:52:58
One way to quickly get their attention, even outside of normal business hours, is  twitter, not sure if that will help you much here
@_date: 2016-10-26 17:03:17
Probably Circle. Surprised that's not an option here...
@_date: 2016-10-27 19:24:37
I noticed the same. I gave them a 5 star rating in the app store to thank them!
@_date: 2016-10-26 17:26:31
Even with the $5-7 premium it's still way cheaper than Coinbase with their extra fees of 2%+
@_date: 2015-09-23 02:54:08
Doesn't sound like the user-friendly device that will take BTC mainstream...
@_date: 2015-09-22 06:13:56
Nice observation! And PayPal's services have added value to millions of consumers across the world. Let's hope Circle can do the same.
@_date: 2015-04-23 01:44:39
ITT: bitcoiners learn what bid/offer spreads are.
Seriously, Coinbase charges a 2% bid/offer spread (or more). Circle charges 0% bid/offer spread.

Hey I'm a bit puzzled by this article as well. It basically contradicts what Jeremy has explicitly said in his recent Re/code op-ed ( and his recent Bitcoin.com AMA.
I guess I would give more credence to Jeremy's own words than a reporter's interpretation.
@_date: 2015-10-29 22:15:29
I see Huobi's price is $328, which is $13 over Bitfinex and Bitstamp (both are around $315).
I see Circle's price around $322, so somewhere in between.
@_date: 2015-03-04 01:58:28
yeah, except GLD annual management fee is 0.40%. BIT is 2%.

OP has done a great job explaining his side of the story. if you don't feel like believing it because you're such a coinbase fanboy, that's really not his problem, and it makes sense for OP to stop responding to you
@_date: 2015-02-26 19:38:23
i guess you are implying bitstamp does not have serious owners despite being backed by pantera capital

how are you able to use Raiffeisen for your bank. didn't they shut down Bitstamp?
