I'm not overly familiar with nicehash so someone else might like to chime in. I've never got into mining per-say, I know how it works just never bothered. But I wouldn't mind letting a spare box mine at a constrained rate (so as to not consume too much electricity) if it would benefit the community/network by handling more transactions and adding resilience, that is what I'm trying to determine - whether it would actually achieve that. I will look into nicehash soon.

I should have mentioned in my OP that is my current mentality - I'm not looking to do the above in order to profit, infact I know it will be at a loss to myself but I think of it as a donation to the community in support of its efforts and network. Which could indirectly end up benefiting me and the community if the whole network succeeds anyway.

TOR provides you anonymity not security, the two should not be confused. It is a great tool and has its place but I personally never enter any login credentials when using it.

Onion Routing is what TOR is known for, an old "Security Now" podcast explains how it works beautifully, skip 30min in:

Thank you for your honest opinion. I was aware that trying to mine at home (with home-user gear) was next to pointless now, but I didn't know if the "mining to earn" or "mining to help the blockchain" were different computations? Does it not help the blockchain/network unless you successfully validate a block? Is mining just 100% about validating and confirming blocks that contain previous transactions? Originally I thought all miners were working hard to do a random math challenge and if they succeeded they were rewarded with coins? As I say I'm not trying to profit at the moment I'm just trying to see if I can help the original Bitcoin network in a meaningful way.
