Eh, I think alot of the distrust of the american currency system falls on misunderstanding how the system works. Sure the supply is always increasing, but it balances out. That small fact that the supply is constantly increasing shouldnt be anybodies basis for any argument.

Well indie labels and major labels are pretty much two separate worlds that have little to do with each other.
edit: didnt mean to end the msg there. Fans of indie labels usually dont mind paying more for physical stuff. I pay for cassettes, many pay for vinyl. There is a strong push against the disposability of music by some (bicep most notably) and you can only find some music on vinyl even (ricardo villalobos). The fans love this stuff. Indie labels are more like artist communities than the cold business that the big labels seem to be.

lol. It took me to read a few more comments to notice. But I do think it might skyrocket at some point, the market cap(correct term? just woke up) is waaaay to small for any currency and once it hits the tipping point it will have to balloon up.
@_date: 2012-09-13 02:40:50
The main financial markets still dont participate that much in it.

Wait, did you downvote me?
@_date: 2012-10-29 17:24:19
lets say an artist gets payed 15% per download, a few percentage points is quite a bit there. Seeing as how its a indie label, its probably a bit more, but its still significant. 
@_date: 2012-07-09 19:52:01
I told my family and that was their reaction. Unless they know how it works, they imagine it has some invisible backsystem that makes money like a ponzey scheme. 
@_date: 2012-07-10 02:49:42
But its all build like that because it makes the system more malleable in the case of a recession. It allows the government to do something. Any other system doesnt let them. Its a good thing that if you look at it from a numbers perspective can seem weird, but it works. The problem is the tax structure, in my opinion.

Been holding out for a bit over a month to make my first purchase, here I come!
@_date: 2012-07-19 02:07:01
I couldnt convince my father to buy a month and a half ago(I'm pretty broke right now, he has funds to play with). I wouldve told him to sell just about now.

As an avid fan of indie labels, your ideas are terrible and out of touch. 
@_date: 2012-07-09 21:29:31
lol, yea idk. Sure. But I chose to have at least a little bit of faith in it. Thats how the whole system works right?
@_date: 2012-07-10 16:49:44
Lol? Your calling the preacher an aethiest, except we have slightly different creation stories but with all the same fundamental beliefs. I dont watch any of that TV bullshit, most of it is embarrassing. What I dont choose to believe is that the system is rigged, inherently. A correct tax structure can fix all of it(around 50-70% for anybody making around ~1.5 million). They do have an inherent advantege, but that is in any economy with any monetary system, and proper taxation should leverage that.

I VERY strongly disagree with this. I do not believe in the governments competence to orchestrate a nation wide reaping of the lesser classes. That is stupid. The rich are just people, most of the time more fair and smarter than less rich people. That's just the truth. Id say there are more noble people with money, by ratio, than the opposite, as ugly as that sounds. 
I believe the current situation is more because of the governments innaction to correct naturally happening trends in society, perpetuated by a false belief that the market is perfect. No form of government is perfect.


I would say you are if you think any society can be let to run without interference and it wont crumble by itself. Policy has to fix the problems as they show up. If you tell me any economic theory to counter act this then you are missing the whole point of what economic theories are, and you should read up on econ 101. They are all theories, based on equal parts science and philosophy, and with much guesswork. 
How the hell is walking away and going to bitcoin going to offer anything different at all. Its going to be the exact same thing with the exact same problems by the time it grows. 
@_date: 2012-07-11 01:51:46
Me? Your the one that said....
@_date: 2012-07-10 02:58:48
Exactly, thats were the faith part comes in. People need to have higher salaries to make up for it, and it does balance out. But republicans muddle up the whole conversation with bullshit. But Economy, as a study, is big part philosophy, so yea it just has to be handled as it goes and itll be fine.  A currency like gold could become extremely volatile and the government wouldnt be able to do anything to help. If it was based on gold a constant evaluation of it would also theoretically be creating more currency somehow.

The thing is that most people that use bitcoin arent productive members of society. Right now its just speculators and people that do illegal activities. 


So you want to live in cuba? with terrible standards of living in a place that was once as good as any place on earth. 


You have to be really naive if you think your solution wouldnt lead to more of what you seek to avoid.
@_date: 2012-06-23 01:21:34
You are the dense one. If you can buy any other currency, it has the use of any other currency in the long run.

But they did get sanctions, and they did have to go through a lot to hide their activities. Anything that makes it easier is good for them.

flipping a coin takes a whole new meaning with bitcoin lol. Parents bitch about everything, my dad is the same way. My brother is about to graduate from UCBerkeley with PHD and my dad is both unimpressed and unsure about his future. 
@_date: 2013-03-08 18:54:06
But wall street attention is really the only means for it to be accepted as a currency. If the people with the most money dont like it, it would be a huge issue.
@_date: 2013-03-08 20:50:07
Well I'm not giving them positive credit. It just so happens that they run this shit and if they widely saw bitcoin as a threat it would get buried. But if they like it, they can say fuck you to the goverment and make money of this instead. Now I am solely looking at this as someone that has an interest in the value going up, and in it getting popular. If wallstreet likes you, you will have people on fox news promoting it quickly. 
@_date: 2013-12-16 23:10:20
And no, if you dont have a reason for you taste I dont respect it. Just I like it is mediocre as fuck and leads to a shitty coorporate run society of ignorant dumbasses. I dont respect that point of view. Investigate, find what you like, and reward quality and hard work.

And to be honest 200 million is tiny. Which is why, when the currency really goes off, if it ever does, it will have to reach billions to become relevant. So investing in this now could be better than original google or apple, a smart bet in my opinion.
@_date: 2013-03-09 02:03:47
First of all, what the flying fuck did 90% of your post have to do with wallstreet?
And, my actual retort:
- If wallstreet can make money of it, and bypass the goverment so **they** can have more control without having to answer to the goverment, why wouldnt they? Wallstreet controls the government, not the other way around. If something threatens the government, it doesnt necessarily threaten wallstreet.
