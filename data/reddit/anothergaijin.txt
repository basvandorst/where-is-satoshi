Show some love to FAST (Foundation for Angelman Syndrome Therapeutics) - they are actively pushing research into gene replacement/activation therapy for a rare genetic condition which many think will open the door to how we can treat other more common disorders like autism or epilepsy.

Recently learnt about Angelman Syndrome and reading about it is fascinating - unlike similar conditions like autism which we still don't fully understand the cause, Angelman's is caused by a single gene being stuck "off" (silenced) and many think the cure is to replace or re-enable it again.
It's fairly exciting as its one of the few developmental disorders which has a real chance of really being cured in the next decade, and as positive research results come in more and more attention is being made to the disorder as it is being seen as a stepping stone to curing more common developmental disorders.

Then Anonabox would not have worked for you. It apparently was a device for "developers", and to be usable required you to login to the device and setup passwords and update the software.

You're kidding right? It was cancelled because the guy was lying about building everything himself - you can buy the hardware today for $20 delivered, and installing the free software takes 10mins
Kickstarter requires that you build something new

And in cases like this the ruling is "you will receive all your money back, except the company has nothing of value, so you get nothing"

Sure, and I’ve increased by bitcoin quantity by nearly 40% in the last month by trading.
For me hodl means having long term faith in bitcoin, but it doesn’t mean I just sit on my coins and do nothing. Bitcoin prices are going up precisely because there is lots of activity. The end goal is to own more bitcoin.

Same, and it's hard to judge. Lots of selling going on now as people expect a crash, but that's just helping to keep the price up. If the price goes down expect to see lots of buying as low prices are a great deal when everyone and their dog knows that no matter how hard it falls, it will recover just as fast.

Bitcoin makes sense in Japan just for that reason - if you want to invest money in Japan your only option is to really look overseas, but its difficult and expensive.

Efficient is not a word you would use with Japan if you knew the truth.

The other side of the system is misreporting crimes to reduce the unsolved rate - murders as suicides, accidents or natural causes, etc.
