Speech is one thing, action is another. Also, freedom of speech is not well-protected in certain instances or in particular places.


There appears to be faulty logic here. The fact is that Ross dissented from the prevailing system, and was subsequently "crushed" with a life+ sentence and millions of dollars in punitive damages. Your normative evaluation doesn't factor into that aspect.


You seem to be confusing two or more people engaged in *actual* mutual, voluntary transactions, and an [existing economic environment]( dominated by systems of control, restriction, distorted incentives, rent-seeking, regulatory capture, artificial barriers to entry, and countless other *anti*-voluntary processes antithetical to "voluntary exchange".


What you are describing is precisely what the current system advocates. There are entities called nation-states that (along with their corporate cronies) possess most of the capital and wealth, have massive standing armies, and pretty much do whatever they want--including systematic [mass murder]( [democide]( [social engineering]( [robbery]( [kidnapping]( [forced labor]( [poverty creation]( and all of the greatest enormities and crimes on the planet; enormities that would be abhorred if engaged in by any one individual.
Unfortunately, the very system you are afraid of is the prevailing system of modernity.
The decentralization of power and the liberation of human beings to freely and mutually associate with one another, whether [two people]( or [one hundred]( as opposed to [associations through violent coercion and force]( greatly reduces the ability of bad actors to do such massive harm.
What agorists, libertarians, market anarchists, and others are proposing is *not a current economic environment minus governments*, but a radically freed society and economic environment that operates on an entirely mutual basis and where power is distributed away from central institutions (governments, corporations, etc.).


Yes, because of *libido dominandi* (lust of domination).

You're making an extensive and invalid logical leap here. The "collective action problem" simply says that there are certain situations that collective action is "preferable" over individual action. It says nothing about *coercive* collective action. Collective action happens all of the time without some people threatening other people.
In addition:
1. What unique problems are solely solved by initiative threats of violence (i.e., coercion)?
2. If  Morally, do the ends justify the means?
3. If  Are you personally willing to walk next door and threaten your neighbor with the physical violence required for your system to function?

Yeah, this is a decent counter-argument, and you've exposed its major flaw ("if the State isn't a true agent of the people") in the context of our current coercive system.
There are, however, a couple of problems with this argument even in a "perfect world" of no State.
1. While it is less arguable that someone does not consent to a certain group action if they voluntarily belong to that group, you still cannot be certain whether *that individual person* condones, approves or is actively participating in initiative violence *just by virtue of "belonging to" said group*. In fact someone may be an active dissenter but still be technically a member of a panarchistic community, for example.    
I think this is a very tenuous ethical stance, but it does get tricky and raise the question of the *level of culpability*.    
How culpable am I if I do completely unrelated business with that agent (I'm still "funding" them)? How culpable am I if I have protective services with that agent, but completely dissent from an action? How culpable am I if I directly fund an action, but don't actually commit it?
2. The response according to the NAP, as I understand it, would be an appropriate level of retaliatory force. So while the actual agent physically attacking me would possibly necessitate deadly force, I wouldn't necessarily be able to apply that to those who fund him (either for said attack or for other reasons) or are simply in "his group" (unless they are also breaking the NAP - threating violence, initiating violence, etc.). But I would possibly be justified in seeking restitutive compensation for losses caused by their third party agent.

I'm assuming you're trying to catch me in some sort of superficial contradiction with that statement; the problem is, if in fact this is the case, you're treading down the well-worn path of the *false dilemma*. That the choice is between a coercive monopoly in an arbitrary geographical area on the one hand, or lawlessness and universal fraud on the other. This is demonstrably false. In addition, just because a coercive monopoly catches a bad guy every once in awhile doesn't transmute the underlying ethics it violates. But to be relatively "happy" one criminal neutralized another criminal isn't contradictory, in my opinion.

You're correct; without the context, this is a valid critique. I completely agree with you.
If you listen to the podcast, the context is around the general sentiment (Bitcoin conferences, and the like) about the goals of Bitcoin in the first world versus the developing world. Andreas is making the point that, for example, many of the Bitcoin conferences he has been to have been centered around venture capitalists and others looking to merely "strike it rich" with a new fad, and how to kowtow to the State and its regulators (...we're generalizing here, of course--there are a lot of fantastic endeavors in the first world, to be sure).
In contrast, he says, those in developing world see the real potential in the Bitcoin protocol, as a way to interact, transact and commune with one another while subverting oppressive and coercive governments, their central banks and their corporate cronies that are causing massive suffering all over the world.
But you're totally right in pointing out that this specific sentiment applies to anyone under a coercive nation-state.

I think this is something that can be difficult to quantify. Like anything, I think it's been a mixed bag. We can all see that State power is on a seemingly inexorable vector of growth. However, you have glimpses of hope - outspoken anarchists like Cody Wilson on NPR's On Point, and they are not laughed off the air. I thought this was pretty amazing. Not to mention agoristic technologies like Bitcoin that help undermine the trapezocracies around the world, the growth of organizations like the Mises Institute and the [Center for a Stateless Society]( more activist/political focused groups like the Free State Project, the secessionist movements in Scotland, Spain and Colorado (not that I agree with any particular groups policies necessarily, but any physical decentralization is a good thing), and even the incrementalism of weed legalization and the bringing of anti-war non-interventionism to the main stage. This is probably wholly inadequate for you, but I really see these ideas spreading; and they are, surprisingly, not *prima facie* dismissed with a handwave by the mainstream anymore. 
I don't believe intellectual paradigm shifts violently (metaphorically, for lack of a better word) change societal consciousness in one fell swoop. But I think as the jack-boots come down harder around the world, and the corporate interests continue exploiting the rest of us by currying state favor, we'll see the methods and ideas I mentioned before spread farther and deeper, and we'll (hopefully) will see the beginning of the end of Institutionalized Aggression. I am hopeful that the principles of human liberation from coercion and exploitation will slowly become the protocol that underpins society.

I'm fine right here. In point of fact, the onus is on you to justify imposing violent coercion upon naturally anarchic human relationships and interactions that, in aggregate, are legitimate society.


Sort of like Ireland from 500 BC to 1600 AD? Or really the bulk of human civilization until relatively recently? How "successful" have States been?


The fact that you are engaged in a conversation (you prefer rational discourse) and not murdering me to get your way (if given the chance) highlights this statement as a performative contradiction. Most people wish, and have an incentive, to resolve problems as peacefully as possible. It's the extremists like you who condone imposing someone's will upon other people, through violence if necessary, that make society difficult to function. Typically, we call those to employ this method to interact with their fellow human beings criminals.
Most human interaction on a day-to-day basis, even yours, is voluntary (anarchic).


In what way? Do you think without a State there wouldn't be comfort? Security? Roads? People are too stupid to figure out basic human needs and infrastructure that we need to eschew normal morality to establish a ruling class (made up of the same stupid people) to do it?

The problem with "Free Market" is the same problem libertarians have when talking to people.
1. 90% of people (made up statistic), when approached with the term "free market" think "the economic situtation we have now, more or less" complete with exploitation, central banks and crony capitalism. Even though this situation is demonstrably not a "free market", it doesn't matter because--frankly--most people are ignorant.

The Bitcoin protocol is built on a system called the *blockchain*.
A blockchain is an electronic ledger - a series of "blocks", or groups of data (in Bitcoin's case, transactions). The transactions themselves are cryptographically signed by the sender, and then verified by "miners" (and in return for the work they do, the miners are awarded with some bitcoins). The way these blocks are verified is through an audit process by which the miners use computer processing power (this is what is called "[proof-of-work](
This whole system provides a solution that has plagued distributed systems since their inception: *how do you find consensus on a network of trustless nodes*? (This is known in computer science colloquially as the "Byzantine Generals' Problem".) 
Blockchain technology [provides that solution]( [[2]](
For currency, this sufficiently protects against the "[double spending]( problem of digital cash, but without relying on a central authority.
But think of what else you can do with a *distributed, decentralized consensus network*. Smart contracts, distributed autonomous organizations, smart property, micro-transactions with no middlemen, decentralized exchanges that can't run off with people's money ... you can effectively replace vast swaths of the world's financial and legal systems (which are corrupt and predatory, by the way) with a few lines of code. And there are no levers of power to abuse.


No one does. There are a myriad of possibilities for this technology. This is part of what is so exciting. What amazing applications have we not thought of yet?

Someone who has a [deontological ethic]( that coercion and initiative violence is always morally wrong.


Depends on what you mean by "government". If you mean a [State]( then no, as States are [predicated upon coercion as a condition of their very existence]( and thus, violate my ethics.
If you mean "society", or "community management" or whatever, then it depends on if one can opt out, without being threatened. Voluntary/mutual consent is the operative concept here.


Again, it depends on how you frame "government". In general, most libertarian anarchists would say *no* for the simple fact that all States' "managerial" arms are governments (so most anarchists don't make a differentiation there). Sometimes I use State/government synonymously, but it depends on my audience. As most *other* people use "government" as a synonym of "community", I have no problem meeting people where they are at, and clarifying that distinction. Also, the fact that there is the concept of voluntary governments ("stateless governance"), see: [panarchism]( 
At that point we're getting into semantic debates, where "voluntary, stateless society" will do.

In your case, rent-seeking simply shifts to hyper-rent-seeking: regulatory capture. This subsequently uses "regulation" to eradicate competition (licensure, etc.), exploit labor and garner privileges that privatize gains and socialize losses. Rent-seeking is special privilege via State power; States are institutions that create oligarchic plutocracies, because they have power to do so--through violent coercion--and are, therefore (and obviously), heavily petitioned by lazy/evil/greedy economic actors outside of that core system. Massive rent-seeking of this scale is impossible in a freed market because there is no one to seek economic rent from.

If you conflate governance and the State, then yes, as it is predicated on coercion as a condition of its very existence. If you can opt out (as in panarchism), then no.


No. Are all laws moral and just?


Depends on if the former is just, or not. I submit the vast majority of enforcement is not just, as it does nothing to protect person or property (and often does the exact opposite), violates peaceful and mutual interaction between people, and does not restitute the victims of actual crimes.


Excellent, now we're getting down to the fundamentals...I believe, as you apparently do, that most communities without a coercively funded, monopolistic security agency would find a way to defend themselves, whether individually or mutualistically.


It's not mine, as I find the vast majority of their action morally abhorrent so I choose not to associate *with them (outside of their expropriation of me via threats). I'd rather contribute to a different protection organization. But they tend to throw you in a cage if you decide to do that. Might makes right, apparently.

The foundation is involved in digital money but unlike Bitcoin it would not be anonymous digital money. In Kenya M-pesa is being used for almost half of all transactions. Digital money has low transaction costs which is great for the poor because they need to do financial transactions with small amounts of money. Over the next 5 years I think digital money will catch on in India and parts of Africa and help the poorest a lot. (

State licensing is political privilege for rent-seekers to gain advantage over competitors, and to shield them in many ways from liability. "Safety" is simply a pretext.
Fraud is already illegal. Tort claims would handle the bulk of these issues. Data and forensic analysis is much easier with the blockchain in many circumstances, as opposed to legacy financial systems.
The difficulty arises by adding State manipulation which introduces all the kinds of unintended consequences that stem from coercive power (see: rent-seeking, regulatory capture, etc.). Besides, the State doesn't really have the track record of detecting, preventing, or even restituting victims of fraud (*cough*2008*cough*).
Decentralized, market "licensing" or certification (UL, Consumer Reports, etc.) is a far better solution.

I'm not an ancap per se, but a libertarian anarchist. I can safely say that most of us consciously do not even vote, for moral and/or pragmatic reasons.
Many choose to expend their energy on activities that actually make a difference, like agorism (Bitcoin, black/grey markets, etc.), education, civil disobedience, cryptoanarchism, etc. 
In addition, some are [voluntaryists]( who reason from an *a priori* deonotological ethical position that the political system is morally deficient and therefore conclude that utilizing it as a means to an end as ethically inconsistent.
So no, my guess would be perpetuating the Warfare State would not be copacetic to a lot of libertarians/anarchists, and indeed be just one--though extremely large--"terrible idea" not worth supporting.

I'm curious, also. If any amount of bandwidth helps, I would gladly set up QoS on my router and set up a RPi2/ODROID or extra desktop dedicated to Bitcoin to take over my network during sleeping hours.
The only thing holding me back from running a full node is that I want to be certain I'm actually helping and not hurting the network. Some people say every little bit of bandwidth helps, others say low bandwidth actually hampers the propagation of data across the network. I haven't come across any incisive clarification on this.
Should an Average Joe with, say, 10-25 down / 1-5 up (Mbps) home connection run a full node (assuming proper set up with port forwarding to allow more than 8 connections)? Or should the full nodes be relegated to Google Fiber and data center level bandwidth?
