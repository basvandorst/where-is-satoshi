Thanks :)

So I'm already losing money, you think the price is going to keep dropping? Should I wait for it to go back up? 
@_date: 2017-08-15 14:30:10
I had an order ready to sell at just a bit higher, and it crashed just before reaching it.. Now I'm screwed xD
@_date: 2017-08-15 15:28:15
Any r/ to recommend besides this one? 
@_date: 2017-08-15 15:12:59
Yeah, it's what I figure. Just have to stop watching my Bitcoin ticker and "forget" about it for a few months, let things sort themselves out :) 
@_date: 2017-08-16 10:04:07
Of course, but some people probably have better guesses than I do ;)

I'm new to Bitcoin, so seeking advice. I get that no one knows for certain, but you probably have better hunches than I do. :) I'll wait a bit then

My point is, it's obviously going to break its ATH like every other week as it keeps rising. It's literally been on the rise since it's existence. Now when there's a huge jump like 6 months ago, yeah that's news. But it following its tendency should be news to anyone in r/bitcoin.
It's like, everyone got excited for episode 7 of Star Wars because it was a huge bump up. It's great that episode 8 is coming out, but for anyone who's following what's happening, the fact that there will be an episode 9 shouldn't be front page news...

So I should post the value of the Tanzanian shilling every other day just so people will know? 
@_date: 2017-11-01 14:26:14
Yeah, because no one in r/bitcoin knows what the current value of bitcoin is.... 
@_date: 2017-11-01 14:35:41
It's rising. It's been rising. Nothing significant about this. If it spiked 50% up or down, and OP asked why or gave an explanation to why, sure, that would be news. But this is just stating what everyone can see on their phone's home screen widget... 
@_date: 2017-11-01 13:19:58
Could someone explain to me why people keep posting about bitcoin's current value? I mean, people who own bitcoin probably keep track of it directly without needing to see a reddit post...
@_date: 2017-09-02 11:01:35
Obviously

But there will always be fees
