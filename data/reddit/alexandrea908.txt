you're wrong about the signals. datalight is an analysis platform, although its graphics might be used everywhere, including "pump and signals" groups, won't argue with that

Well but as I aware of H.I. it counts all of the users' activity that includes spam and bots, so, my question is will they filter the data or not?

Xcoex has summed up the results of giveaway yesterday. I hoped I had a chance to win but I'm not lucky-man. I mean there's no chances to get smth for free

Yeah, it was announced in twitter.  Lots of unique features is nice, for sure but how useful they are?

Does somebody trade on [yobit.net]( I believed it's simple shit that can freeze funds, isn't it? Apparently... they made some list of best exchanges only because of average visits per month. there's no volumes as a whole

You can check "xcoex" in telegram, they promised to conduct another one soon but I'm not sure

I’m not sure about signals as there’s no info about it, regarding analysis tools I’ll try it, for sure

You might ask datalight's team directly in twitter, they should send you invite link, bro

There are already 140 users, you're moving a bit too fast, I don't have time to register many accounts on Xcoex LOL. Сhanging the subject, I'd like to add that it's curious since phone number might influence the amount of swindlers who try to sign up for several times.
