I don't think you understand what the point of regulation is. Regulation does not exist to protect you. That idea is pure fantasy.

Is this a full-time thing? What's the time-line like? Number of hours expected per week if this is not full-time? I live in Philadelphia, work as a UI Architect full-time currently and have also worked with LAMP full-time in the past. I have a good amount of experience with LAMP and numerous JavaScript frameworks. Shoot me a msg if you're looking to talk. Depending upon your budget, I might able to do this, or the company I work for would be interested. Either way, I'm interested in hearing more.

Sure, and to a point, they are correct. Wars are profitable if you are in the business of making the tools of war, but not so much for people who have their homes or businesses destroyed or looted. The problem lies with the fact that the people who believe this also happen to believe that everyone else will believe this when the world so clearly demonstrates that not everyone believes this.

Did you look for it on blockchain.info? I pulled money in the course of about 10 transactions today. Only 5 made it. The other 5 show as having been made in the transactions tab on the site, but they never made it to my local wallet. I seached the blockchain using the address I was sending to and there was never any record of them being transacted. They merely reduced my balance, but never actually sent the coins. I filed a support request, for what its worth.

There's a difference between initiating force and self-defense. If someone owes me money and there is a judgement I can not myself seize their possessions, nor can I hire just anyone to do it for me. It is going to be a government agency that does such things.

For it to be true that the deflationary model discourages people from spending BTC, then fiat money must be a failure because it discourages people from acquiring it due to the fact that it loses value.

Yes, there was a cost/benefit and the Vikings obviously felt there was a benefit. Until the people of what we now call England stopped thinking of themselves as being members of regional tribes and began to think of themselves as "English" and managed to organize themselves sufficiently well enough to fend off the Viking raids. And that's how the English state was formed.

They assume that the use of violence would be rational as well. And since violence is unprofitable, people would not use violence. That is the assumption, at least. But history shows that the reasons why people use violence is not very well calculated and is done even though they have nothing to gain. 
@_date: 2014-02-06 19:14:26
In a way, its completely rational. You're going to see a lot of finance types from BoA and Citi and the like BEG for Bitcoin to be regulated. Why? Because they are huge corporate monoliths and the regulations that will be applied will require a huge corporate entity and its resources in order meet the regulatory requirements. This will kill the 22 year old in his living room type of upstarts. People on Wall Street who are smart enough to understand Bitcoin must have some inkling as to the sort of threat it represents to the established order. They know they can't put the genie back into the bottle. So they will simply regulate the new comers in the Bitcoin space out of existence and see to it that the only organizations that can afford to meet regulatory guidelines are the GoldmanSachs type companies in the world, thus ensuring the status quo.

The assumption by these same folks is that anarchy has never happened before, or at least that's the impression I get. History has plenty of examples. And by anarchy, I mean decentralized violence, instead of monopolized violence. And in pretty much every instance, it was a disaster.

It mattes upon perspective, outcome, etc. Was WWII profitable for Japan? How about the UK? The USA? In the case of Japan, ultimately it was very unprofitable in the end, for reasons obvious. The UK? Well, they lost the better part of an Empire and have been playing second fiddle to other nations since then. How about the USA? Since we inherited much of the UK's sphere of influence and obtained nearly uncontested dominance of trading lanes and cheap labor in Asia, markets in Europe, etc, I'd have to say it was very profitable. How about the Iraq war of recent years? If you are Halliburton, certainly profitable. But what about the US state? What have we gained? Gas is certainly much more expensive, we've destabilized the region, etc. ... Additionally, I should clarify, and probably should have before writing the previous, the bit about wars being unprofitable is an assumption that libertarians/anarch-capitalists make. I don't necessarily believe that.
@_date: 2014-04-25 00:03:47
True story. Both philosophies rely upon a completely unrealistic expectation of human nature and behavior. Communism assumes that man's desire to form hierarchies is some artificial construct externally imposed, and that people can and will work without proper incentives to produce. Anarcho-capitalism supposes that everyone will voluntarily forgo socio-political advantages associated with violence. The long and short if it is, they both only make sense if you ignore everything that is obvious about human nature. (Speaking as a person who adheres to the NAP. I may find the NAP preferable, but I am under no illusion the rest of the world will go along with my preferences.)

My undertanding is tht it is a banking regulation. Users are limited to $1,000 worth of transactions per day, and $10,000 per month. From what I've read, anything over that limit and suddenly the regulatory requirements become very burdernsome due to the fact that the gov't then considers the exchange to be something akin to a bank (or at least an entity that has a much higher level of regulation and gov't oversight). This seems to be a very big impediment to liquidity in the future. I doubt the gov't will change the law, so there's going to need to be some sort of work around to stay with in regulatory limits, one would suppose.

I think this is a really great idea. Like any idea, it could probably use some further discussion but I definitely see where you're coming from. 
There are numerous reasons why we need implementing a more robust exchange system. I think we need to do what we can to avoid any sort of centralized power to have too much control in this system, whether it be some imposed central authority, or a cartel or natural monopoly that might naturally arise, as mtgox was.
There's one really big elephant in the room that I haven't really seen anyone mention yet and your idea may very well address it. The whole $1,000/$10,000 limit issue is going to cause MAJOR liquidity problems. Some sort of mesh-like system of exchanges might route around that problem.
Did you post your idea on forum.bitcoin.org?

If you call legal tender laws backing, then I suppose so. But at the base level an American dollar, like just about every other currency on the planet, is based upon the assumption that it is legal for all debts, public and private. A currency does not need a legal tender law to be a currency. Additionally, the bitcoin has drastically increased in value since its inception, which is a deflationary event, not inflationary. 
@_date: 2011-05-18 13:03:23
You're completely missing the point of price discovery -- it is subjective and based upon what the buyer and seller agree upon. That's how it works. If two parties agree to pay and be paid in toothbrushes, then so be it. The value of a bitcoin is what the buyer and seller agree it is, just like any other currency. Just because the government doesn't pass a law making it the monopoly money of the land doesn't not make it money. By the way, 10,000 bitcoins were worth $20 a year ago. Today, about $70,000. So while you are arguing about it not being worth anything, the market seems to have decided against your best wishes and has done what it needs to do with value and price.

What does selling an asset one owns have to do with Enron? Enron was involved in massive accounting fraud and manipulation of energy markets -- by creating artificial shortages, thus screwing consumers out of money. There's no similarity.

There seems to be a lot of arbitrage spread between different exchanges. This would probably eliminate that as the spreads are created by liquidity bottlenecks.

I think given that this is not a fiat currency and not a fractional reserve situation, I don't really understand how loans are possible. At least in a fiat system, you can always assume the money supply will always expand, thus there will always be depreciated dollars to pay back a loan. But not the case with bitcoin. The money supply is eventually fixed. You'd end up with more outstanding obligations than could ever possibly be paid back. And bitcoin would not allow for the counterfeiting that is at the core essence of money lending in a traditional economy.
@_date: 2011-05-20 15:16:55
You're starting with a completely false premise. 
Economic history is not taught in econ programs so there is very little knowledge about the past, thus its tough to rebut today's orthodoxy. For example, I believe between the end of the Civil War and the late 19th century, the US money supply declined somewhere in the neighborhood of 60% or 70%. The population exploded, economic activity boomed, and the US became a world power in one of the greatest economic leaps in history -- all with a depreciating currency. Additionally, nineteenth century Britain experienced 50 years of falling prices, even though living standards rose at an unprecedented rate and level. From 1875 to 1895 wholesale prices fell by about 45 per cent while industrial output and real wages continued to rise. 
The "problem" with deflation in a fiat system is that deflation happens when debts are not paid, after all, money = debt. So if debts are written off, so is a portion of the money supply. On the other hand, in a bitcoin economy, deflation happens because the value of the currency rises out of supply/demand reasons, not debt defaults. In no small part this is a political problem, as much as an economic problem. 
Having bitcoins increase in value will encourage adoption of the system. Secondly, inflation can happen in a bitcoin economy, but only when the economy is contracting. When that happens holders of bitcoins will be incentivized to spend because no one wants to hold a currency that is losing value, thus increasing market transactions and product, which in turn would smooth out disruptions to the economy.

This is probably the most important thing to note about a bitcoin currency: In a fiat system the rate of money growth and corresponding value of the money operates along an exponential function. As the money supply tends towards infinity over time, as the curve goes parabolic, the value of the currency follows an inverse path -- it tends towards 0 value. But neither value (infinite money supply/0 value of currency) is ever actually achieved.
Bitcoin operates in a diametrically opposed manner. The value of the currency will slowly tend towards infinity as the supply tends towards the finite 21 million, but neither values are every achieved. The function will tend towards those values over time, just as the fiat money supply would always tend towards an infinite supply and 0 value.
Logistic function, definition:
Exponential function, definition:
@_date: 2011-06-02 03:27:40
Well, in a fiat system, the money supply *tends* towards infinity, as a fiat system will have compound interest applied to all new money creation, as all new money is debt. But bitcoin is not debt. It is not a promise. It is actual money and no one owes anyone anything in relation to its creation. 
So loans are entirely necessary in order to keep a fiat system from contracting. But the fact that there is an ever-expanding money supply ensures there will be additional dollars in circulation in the future, all of which will be cheaper than they are now. 
So.... in order to understand loans, we have to understand what a loan really means in a fiat system vs. a bitcoin system. The differences are substantial as a fiat system is based upon an exponential function and bitcoin is based upon a logistics function. Both are very different animals.
I dunno. I'm sort of thinking out loud. I figure its a matter of time before someone smarter than I has the same question and hopefully the answers as well.
Let me throw something out there... it is my understanding that Koranic Law (follow me, please) prohibits fractional reserve banking. There are no loans at interest in a purely Islamic system. Based upon my understanding, money, as in commodity money (gold) is actually "leased". I don't know what that means in practice. Understanding this concept might help with understanding a non-fractional, no-fiat, non-exponential money system that bitcoin supposes to be.
Anyway, I hope this thread continues and maybe others might have some thoughts.

Increasingly liqudity, in any sort of situation that includes a high risk of deflation, does very little to fight the boom/bust cycle. See Japan's experience for the past 20 years or our present. The Fed has increased the money supply nearly 300% in the past 3 years and we are no better off economiclly. If anything, we might not be in crisis mode, but that sort of liqudity should have brought us out of this recession. It didn't.
As far as being a benefit from a certain perspective, yes, it is -- but for the wrong people. It is how power and wealth is accumulated. Give someone the power to coin, and they control society. This liquidity the Fed has injected came from where, exactly? They produce nothing. They add value to nothing. They simply make a book keeping entry. And we wonder why the rich keep getting richer?
