Great post! I’ve seen a lot of random friends “investing” in bitcoin or crypto without doing a single piece of research about it. Just the typical wow let’s get rich quick!
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:59:42
Don’t understand the point of “non government controlled” when the users try to create their own little government and shoot down any opponents. Advancement is made through competition and open market. BOTH sides should support the separate vision of the other and hope that at least 1 one of them survives. Coexistence can exist whether or not you share a genesis block is irrelevant. Or maybe they can’t coexist, either way it’s for the market to decide not a bunch of trolls on either or side.
If bitcoin had less people spending time creating memes and more people doing constructive activities it probably would already be on a much larger scale then it is now. Wasted time is wasted.
Bitcoin is not a business and that analogy is flawed.

I never really got into the crypto reddit because it's so filled with this stuff.
@_date: 2017-11-14 12:15:41
Do you not see the irony in basing this on your personal bias against it...  Do we call Bitcoin shit instead of cookies if the price drops or goes up? No.  I bought bitcoin cash because I can still transact with it, that’s my personal preference.  The worth of the good is set by the consumer of it and you ignore the reality that it has consumers.

I started using Bitcoin for ecommerce (legally) among friends when the price was roughly $7-8 a coin. Want to know what I use for ecommerce now? Not bitcoin.         That is why I use bitcoin cash. No conspiracy, simply transaction.
@_date: 2017-11-14 12:36:14
You have a bias against all bullies and all liars  yet you’ve compared my brain to a lizard, called me a fool, said the coin I like is shit and quite literally compared it to a steamy pile of poop.... but you don’t like bullies? Please do explain to me what a bully is defined as
@_date: 2017-11-14 05:17:46
You base a movement by the mouths of a few...? I Identify Bitcoin Cash as Bitcoin Cash and Bitcoin as Bitcoin. Yet, I prefer many things about Bitcoin Cash's technology. I do not hold Bitcoin Cash out as Bitcoin and neither do many.
@_date: 2017-11-14 12:25:09
You say Bitcoin Cash will be centralized in the future, they say lightning network will be centralized... Yeah, to each their own.
If you don't like it then don't buy it, don't trash someone else's work.
I don't have a defense reflex, your bias is simply obvious when you call one god and one shit.
@_date: 2017-11-14 13:56:05
You bring up good points, especially with cpsc and tech, I should mention I’m also a marketing major and past salesman.   I’ll try to respond when I get back today. For now good talk, ciao
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:26:17
Ugh... the point is I can’t use bitcoin for ecommerce right now which is why I use bitcoin cash... how is this hard to understand lol??? If bitcoin had maintained reliability as an instrument of ecommerce (yes I’m talking fees) then I’d still be using it!
@_date: 2017-11-14 12:01:20
So I assume if bch survives after January your opinion becomes useless? Cya then.
@_date: 2017-11-14 12:51:02
My feelings aren't hurt I'm trying to convey the point lol.
Your opinion that I'm being fooled is based on your personal opinion of the coin, I don't believe you're being fooled into supporting Bitcoin. Personal preference. 
If you think I'm uneducated then I won't argue it, but I've still been involved in bitcoin since fairly close to the beginnings and I still am studied in computer science. 
What you don't seem to understand is that if I wanted to stop I surely could, I don't want to stop.  IF bitcoin cash is inferior then you've nothing to worry about, if it proves superior then bitcoin as a whole has just made its first large-scale pivot just as any startup would.        
I understand some people will currently claim bitcoin cash as bitcoin, what do you want me to do about it? If I claimed Nazi Germany was awesome that doesn't mean all bitcoin cash feels the same or that all America feels the same. Understand what I'm saying? Yes, people support it (Bitcoin as the name) in the community but many also go against it openly.
If PayPal can be made better we could most certainly do so. Is bitcoin not aiming to replace gold? We already have gold why have bitcoin? It's an upgrade as is Bitcoin cash as a means of commerce.
@_date: 2017-11-14 14:01:05
Dude your head is so far up your own ass shit is falling out of your mouth. I did not say I invested at this point (besides a few coins I’ve since swapped around) I said “I STARTED USING BITCOIN” meaning I was using it alongside or instead of PayPal which is no longer possible. GET IT?? I want bitcoin for a global currency!
@_date: 2017-11-14 04:53:04
lol and do you say the same thing when bitcoin price drops? I don't think so. Each is their own entity.
@_date: 2017-11-14 05:04:01
Yet your reddit tore down a person's work for the benefit of a meme. Very brotherly.
@_date: 2017-11-14 04:12:07
This is exactly right. I would never tear down support for any coin whether I like it or not.
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:56:44
I mean I honestly think this is a bit exaggerated and I really don’t think many people have been confused by it like that. I’ve referred many users to crypto on either side as a bipartisan without explaining the two and no one had a difficulty. Yeah if farmer joe signs up he might be confused but right now farmer joe isn’t going to sign up and he won’t for a very long time, by the time he does I don’t think we’ll even be debating between the two anymore. 
Let me ask, what’s your ideal version of the poster? Keep in mind both sides believe they are utilizing the bitcoin software so try to give a non biased to either side response.   This is a genuine question because I’m creating content and would like to understand the triggers.
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:19:36
Lol yes the reason why people use bitcoin doesn’t matter at all.
@_date: 2017-11-14 11:42:27
Exactly. It’s ok to be an asshole if some of your friends think it’s funny too.
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:48:50
And yes I understand it’s confusing, again I wish there was no split and that bitcoin was usable as a cash system still but the fact of the matter is right now it’s not.   The best anyone can do is prevent sending to a wrong address by clearly labeling it on wallets or exchanges which I think they have been
@_date: 2017-11-18 22:26:26
I sent $250 for $0.40 on bch but $1 was $0.20 
Both networks still have room for improvement that we know for sure.
@_date: 2017-11-14 11:59:36
If you’re saying they thought it was bitcoin then no, they’re paying the current market price. 1:1 of what they thought they’d be getting
@_date: 2017-11-14 05:11:04
Yep, you and the numerous supporters of this thread.
Tear down 100 I'll put up 1,000.
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:47:13
Ironic because a huge part of bitcoin was made possible by shady enterprise. You can call it what you like, doesn’t mean everyone agrees. 
Good day
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:24:30
Does anyone have the actual content of the letter? I can’t freeze it on my phone for some reason but I feel like they simply described bitcoin as a p2p digital currency or something along those lines and people are freaking out because they both share basically the same description because they are basically the same underlying software. Unless he said we are segwit or core I don’t understand how you think he might be misguiding people?    I’m not trying to argue or flame you for the sake of arguing or flaming I genuinely don’t understand what people mean by it
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:21:56
Social engineering/ psychological manipulation and utilizing the name of an open source software as the prefix are totally different man. I mean Jesus you don’t own the name nor do they
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:29:39
I’m not saying bitcoin is wrong I’m saying everyone who wants to use it for ecommerce can’t which makes bitcoin cash the best option for all of us. I mean I literally own a chunk of an ecommerce hub and it’s basically impossible for our clients to accept bitcoin right now, understand? I advocate crypto currency and a united world currency. I don’t care which coin does it as long as someone does it and everyone eventually gets on board. For my use case right now it’s bitcoin cash, if that changes then my ideals will change but right now they won’t. I don’t give a shit about the development teams or your arguments if we did xyz first and neither will the general public which seems to be what neither side is able to understand. Whoever gets the general public wins, case closed.
@_date: 2017-11-14 12:09:19
No, they get $1000 worth when they pay $1,000 worth. Jeez this is basic economics man you cannot truly be this ignorant can you?  Calling me a fool in no way supports your claim, regardless I don’t need to call you names to feel good about my post.
Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin Cash. Bitcoin is Bitcoin. Open source software is open source. Stop getting your panties in a bunch when someone uses it as such, it is not your software, you have no claim to it, neither do I or anyone else.  My grandpa could distinguish between the two by names.
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:47:05
Okay and I can see that confusion but assuming they saw bitcoin for a digital cash isn’t bitcoin cash the right solution for them anyways? I mean bitcoin isn’t very usable as a cash right now unless you want to spend a stupid amount in fees or use a centralized site like coinbase to Transfer
@_date: 2017-11-14 04:56:46
found him thank you :)
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:41:06
But again what I’m saying is bitcoin was a software developed by satoshi and it is open source therefore anyone using that source originated from bitcoin as an open source software am I correct? There is differentiators between the two versions of the code and the actual name has a differentiator. I guess I mean it’s not like someone is going to go on coinbase (can’t yet) and say oh there’s bitcoin and there’s bitcoin cash let me buy bitcoin cash because it’s bitcoin or buy bitcoin and click on bitcoin cash. I mean these sites still put up very clear markers saying stuff like don’t send bitcoin to a bch address etc.
I mean it seems to me like an argument from both sides just to criticize the other when in reality it doesn’t really matter. Again just my $0.02
@_date: 2017-11-14 04:08:46
If whoever is putting these up sees this message shoot me a message on reddit or twitter (  I'm going to fund you $100 for more because this shit is ignorant and childish. This moron would rather see no support for crypto than seeing recognition for any type of crypto because it's not the one he prefers.
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:45:21
And although I prefer bch right now I would much rather have seen bitcoin not run into the problem from the beginning. If bitcoin stayed on the path I believe it should have and maintained the ability to be used in commerce then it would have led to a much simpler and faster adoption by the general public. The split is both good and bad for adoption for various reasons. I’m just saying there’s a whole side of people like me who don’t give a shit about store of value and just want a world currency. And there is people who want a store of value. And people who want both.      From what I’ve seen the lightning network just seems to be a blocker to entry into the market and adds yet another layer of difficulty for a beginner to understand. If I’m wrong then hell I’d even switch 
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:52:43
That’s true but I also work with startups and know that when it’s time to pivot it’s time to pivot. Id bet rome wasn’t built using the original plans either.
Your name is accurate, you’re truly an infection to bitcoin as a whole and people such as yourself very much so hinder adoption to any crypto currency. You might laugh it off and that’s your choice but just know that you’re part of the problem. Plenty of users have had civil conversations in here thus far.
@_date: 2017-11-14 05:44:00
You’re like a little troll child who just had his lollipop taken away.
@_date: 2017-10-23 04:54:47
Massive... but yet it’s not overthrown...
People not trusting the government and people being worried the government are going to straight up drain their bank account are so incredibly different.. sorry but if the public cares like you think they do then they would have switched already. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 04:20:51
Clearly you have no experience with the general public
@_date: 2017-10-23 04:33:45
This is exactly right. I’m not saying it’s not true or it’s not a benefit.... simply that most people don’t care. Honestly I believe it turns them (general public) off in fear (of criminality) more than anything.  
@_date: 2017-10-23 05:04:45
Lots of thing are bad... but people don’t act until it affects them and the only way that would affect people in that massive of a way is 1) a global or national recession and banks lockdown 2) the government stole everyone’s money and emptied our banks
2 is probably not going to happen 
1 is possible but only time can tell
@_date: 2017-10-23 11:39:25
Lol are you scared of your own answers results?
You’re a fool for believing people think this.
Point is people don’t fucking care till it affects them and what you’re saying will never affect enough people!!! 
Jesus you guys are simple minded I’m done wasting my time here. People like you will never push Bitcoin through only drive users away. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 18:18:34
A limited venue option is completely arbitrary at this point. You’re literally giving the same opinions people once gave Bitcoin but think they no longer apply.
Once again I’m interested in facts not opinion. When you say one miner controls it how is that the case by that I mean what gives that person this power?
@_date: 2017-10-22 18:30:26
While it’s true I do have a project which involves bch the project is about crypto currency. The same infrastructure is being setup simultaneously on Bitcoin and ethereum so no, I have no bias.
@_date: 2017-10-22 21:49:49
To be honest I don't think that's a great way to say it.
Not because it's not true or whatever but a couple things...
1) Norms don't understand a database
2) Norms think you saying everyone has that database means everyone COULD fuck them out of their money.
While they may understand it I think it's still scaring them.  But of course it depends on their technical knowledge
@_date: 2017-10-22 23:01:16
How often does law enforcement or IRS seize money from a regular guys bank account? Explaining it as a way to avoid law enforcement seizure only makes it sound like a criminal enterprise 
@_date: 2017-10-22 18:28:55
Fantastic, thanks for leaving the first constructive post.
@_date: 2017-10-22 18:27:42
And yet making a single post I can identify the major topics for both sides easily and efficiently before digging down into the technical truths.
Are you a writer as well :)?
@_date: 2017-10-22 18:13:33
Not interested so much in that side of things. Markets go up and down all the time. 
I want to know the technical differences. Why is smaller or bigger blocks better? How does it effect consumers?
@_date: 2017-10-22 18:36:16
I cannot because I’m not active in either. Nor am I active in bch as I’m sure you well know after researching my posts I have few and far between with my 250+ days on reddit :)
Everything is not a conspiracy. I’m interested only in gaining opinions from each side. Have you noticed I’ve not posted this same topic in bch yet? That’s because I’ve chose to get bitcoins side first as the current market share holder. 
If I only cared what Bch had to say I wouldn’t be sitting here asking you what you have to say. Unfortunately, what you’ve had to say so far is of no use
@_date: 2017-10-23 11:24:51
“ civil seizure, is a controversial legal process in which law enforcement officers take assets from persons suspected of involvement with crime or illegal activity without necessarily charging the owners with wrongdoing.” 
Show me how many people have been affected by that directly and divide it by the total population.
Simply reading that people won’t back you on the premise of criminal alone. Hell i’m living proof people won’t switch on that alone. I’m aware yet I’m not worried my bank will be seized.
@_date: 2017-10-22 18:42:37
What’s surprising? The fact that I didn’t make an equal posting for a single supportive statement across all boards? 
Maybe it’s just me but that doesn’t seem very unusual.
Anyways if you decide to share some technical insight I’d be excited to hear them :)
— as an edit on your original 1 miner comment why is this the case? I didn’t not mean to refute your statement I’m just unfamiliar with it.
@_date: 2017-10-23 04:44:40
By that logic it’s your fault for not paying enough tax to protect yourself.
