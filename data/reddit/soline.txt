I don't think he thinks it's an opinion but rather a fact, which makes him seem like he knows something no one can know right now. People don't like that.

I'm also with CampBX and I am pretty sure both the referrer and the referee get something, like 10% discount/10% commission.

I thought one of the benefits of bitcoin was that it was independent of any govt action against it. If that is not the case, then it has been useless from the beginning. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:39:08
Then they won't be worth $10 anymore. 
@_date: 2013-04-19 07:53:22
Too soon? This is Bitcoin. Bitcoin is technology and technology develops at an accelerated pace. I'd say the timeframe of bitcoin's development is normal for what it is. 
@_date: 2013-05-02 02:07:02
Many people have the same idea, this is why it will not go below 100.

I had this question earlier today 
I don't really agree with the answer. The value should be the same everywhere, not differ by each exchange. 
@_date: 2013-04-21 19:36:32
I know there aren't many users but I have never seen this much volatility is such little time. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 10:56:34
I used them for my first BTC buy yesterday. Everything went pretty smoothly although I did end up paying probably $20 or $30 more per bitcoin due to CampBX being higher than MtGox when I bought. 
@_date: 2013-04-24 14:46:54
agreed, if you use dwolla, you can have money in company in 6 hours max. It takes a few days for dwolla to get your bank funds though.

I thought the exchanges were what made the value of the bitcoins drop, not the bitcoins themselves. Because seriously, these exchanges are whack. 
Also, when you reference tulip bulbs like everyone else who does when speaking of the value of bitcoins, you sound really....old. You're also comparing tulips to digital currency. Tulips that were only available in Europe to a currency available globally. Tulips that came from Holland and must have been exported out of Holland to the countries that wanted them, in very scarce supply and at slow speed to areas where they did not have them. So I can see why the price of tulip bulbs did what it did. I feel like the people that reference tulip bulbs, just don't understand plants and by extension, they don't understand what they are comparing things to, like digital currency to plants.

People have confidence in Bitcoin and lack confidence in the exchanges. 
@_date: 2013-04-18 23:50:40
This is the issue with bitcoins, it takes a while to get into the market initially. 
@_date: 2013-04-21 17:31:00
don't worry, that all time high will probably be the average by wednesday. 
@_date: 2013-04-24 00:45:56
I'm all for the proliferation of bitcoin but if that happens, dear lord I am cashing out in USD and reaching my goal of becoming mortgage-free a lot sooner than I thought i would. 
@_date: 2013-04-18 19:41:03
I'm just going to shamelessly post my sign-up affiliate link for them here: 
And follow-up with my review that so far they have been the best exchange out there from what I have experienced and what I have heard about other exchanges. I was going to go with Mt.Gox when I first discovered bitcoin but then all the lagging and crash happened and it apparently takes forever to get funds into your mt.gox account. i already signed up with Dwolla to move funds and CampBX accepted cash through Dwolla. I used another redditor's affiliate link to sign-up and got discounted commission fees, at least initially but it seems to be .55% for all my transactions currently. 
edit: I was unsure how the discount worked but it looks like you get your 10% refund on commissions at the end of each month. 
@_date: 2013-04-21 00:49:56
wait but r/bitcoin told me this was a scam and that these things didn't even exist. 
@_date: 2013-04-18 22:33:54
Can someone explain to me how the IRS can track Bitcoin income. I am totally confused about it. There are no 1099s. 
@_date: 2013-04-21 17:43:01
well if they were permanently offline then that would be good because they would be a non-issue.
@_date: 2013-04-20 12:14:05
not everything is a bull trap, bear trap or dead cat bounce. The price has been pretty stable over the past week and trending upwards at a slow pace.
@_date: 2013-04-13 01:07:00
exactly this. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 01:05:51
I went with Dwolla -&gt; CampBX. It took about 5 days to get money from my bank account to Dwolla including verification but only a few hours to get it from Dwolla to CampBX. I am unverified on CampBX so that means they limit your transactions to $1000 USD a day. They want a lot of info to verify. 
@_date: 2013-04-20 12:17:03
I imagine they would catch up pretty fast when they do get the mini rigs. 
@_date: 2013-04-21 19:40:51
That has been down for hours and there was a general decline in price because of it but it went from 105 to 126 and back to 114 in about 15 minutes and I saw quite a few .01 orders too. 
@_date: 2013-05-14 20:35:55
Is that really what caused that drop? I don't understand why that would cause it and it's already coming back up. 
@_date: 2013-04-18 21:58:35
yep people are suddenly buying right now. Not sure why. 
@_date: 2013-04-18 22:27:57
oh, the irony
@_date: 2013-04-18 19:34:03
This is great I have literally been carrying my cord with me everywhere I go. 
@_date: 2013-04-25 18:03:51
I heard about silkroad and that led me to bitcoin at the beginning of this month just as everyone was jumping on the bitcoin bandwagon. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 20:36:24
same here
@_date: 2013-04-08 11:30:59
I heard the word 'bitcoin' over the past couple years but never really knew what it was. About a week ago, I found out of about Silk Road, found it used bitcoin, then did my research on bitcoin. I decided needed to buy some and wanted to do it anonymously. When I figured out you can't truly be anonymous buying bitcoins, I decided to just link up my bank account to buy some. I am kicking myself for not doing that at the beginning of last week because now i have to wait for all these services to verify my bank account and having an online bank, I can't just go and get a big withdrawal to get a money order for faster methods. I had no idea the price would go up this fast. They were are $90 when I found out about them a week ago. I am just hoping that there are many out there like me, discovering bitcoin and waiting to get verified to buy. So when I do buy in, it will continue to go up so I can at least make up my investment before it is smooth sailing. 
@_date: 2013-04-25 21:13:03
yeah just don't worry about it. Everyone was panic selling including myself so I could buy in lower but now it's all gonna go back up. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 10:53:30
I'm not sure what people were expecting from this video. It's a pretty standard video from a small business. I thought it was well done. 
@_date: 2013-05-02 02:05:13
It's hard to use something as currency when you have to keep buying it to use it in order to buy things. 
@_date: 2013-05-15 14:09:32
But the issue with the dollar seems to make people lose faith in bitcoin. If the two are linked than it's not really independent. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:26:35
overpriced. people are asking for too much. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 17:42:32
hmm, I wish I had known that before i transferred funds to CampBX.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:13:16
welcome to reddit as a whole. Nothing has actually changed, it's all perception.
@_date: 2013-04-18 23:57:07
Okay so they had a bad experience with a company. It happens. 
@_date: 2013-04-19 02:10:19
Very nice, I'm glad they also had some info regarding power consumption. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:35:15
If I ever want to hear some trite saying about stocks, I come to this subreddit. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 13:39:16
Where do people get shipping in two weeks? It depends on when you ordered. FAQs explain how they will be shipping. If you placed an order recently, they will not be shipping it until July. 
@_date: 2013-04-24 15:14:47
@_date: 2013-04-13 01:23:21
But the exchanges create different communities of people buying and selling at different prices from other exchanges. It's doesn't make sense for one currency to have different values depending on what exchange it is traded on. 
@_date: 2013-04-22 19:08:26
so who benefits? 
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:14:07
what?! I've been waiting a week for my cash and stuff to get moved to dwolla and now i have to wait longer?!
@_date: 2013-04-25 21:01:10
CampBX being down is happening more often. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 18:02:31
uh huh but wasn't that hold DDoS at Mt.Gox and lag like a huge deal? Because that's what this subreddit has been telling me. If that had not happened what would have made people sell so soon after the price started increasing? Most people seemed to want to hold for a long time and many still have.
