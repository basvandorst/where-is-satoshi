Yes, but payouts are weekly or monthly. $60 million was already mined and went directly to one wallet. CEO disappeared. Go to their facebook page or twitter and shits the word
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:03:12
Go ahead and give it away. Took some of us YEARS of believing and investing , but YOU can give it away. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:54:13
$60 million total + [CEO]( is on the run, closed shop
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:00:33
Keep sucking on it. Tit ain't milking after 6 hours. No twitter messages , no facebook , grab another dry tit. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:48:43
You dumbass! How can you put all you bitcoin in one echange? Everyone keeps telling you to keep it all in different exchanges and wallets . If they get "hacked" you lose everything. Maybe you deserve to get your ass kicked for being an ass
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:40:58
$60 million lost to one address 
@_date: 2014-03-02 17:05:15
only if you call $IP or what ever you wish to take from your users 
@_date: 2014-02-26 02:49:11
exactly what I am thinking. I am keeping mine. Bought a few gyfts while the prices were over $1k , and bought out my initial investment. 
@_date: 2014-03-01 15:55:51
The link has Malware, they pick up your ip and try to break in to steal your keys ;)
@_date: 2014-05-08 21:21:17
so .... where on the TOR network can I  give money?
@_date: 2014-02-26 02:47:31
There are other exchanges and too many btc's floating around that makes your idea of the market tanking unviable.
@_date: 2014-10-09 03:57:05
its the shits. 
@_date: 2014-02-24 14:00:15
At the end it's about bitcoin .....
@_date: 2014-02-11 20:47:06
US GOV is doing the DDOS'ing and everyone knows it!
@_date: 2014-04-11 01:15:24
WTF is happening? BUY , BUY , BUY !!!!!!!!!!!!!11
@_date: 2014-01-06 17:20:58
What difference does it make? He who jumps in takes market share and wins....
@_date: 2014-08-18 16:27:01
I already sold everything. Its just a Strategy, there is more to it. I did not specify how I came up with the solution or source for my program. It works though. Have not lost much, have gained significantly
@_date: 2014-04-17 21:46:07
DONT PANIC, JUST TRANSFER TO YOUR LAPTOP OR PC AT HOME.
@_date: 2014-03-05 17:58:12
If you get blockchain info on your bitcoin is it crackable with brute force?
Do you use john the ripper?
@_date: 2014-07-03 13:52:42
I agree. 
@_date: 2014-10-13 16:51:30
includes bitcoin! LoL
@_date: 2014-06-30 21:29:34
I knew they have the stashes
@_date: 2014-02-13 03:07:39
original miner? There's always one better .... damn, 
My kid bro got me into bitcoin and I didn't have anything else to use
my pc for . 
@_date: 2014-02-03 12:12:58
Heard some untrustworthy words that gov might have started it to move everyone to a paperless society. My mind says its the opensource beginnings of it that  make it safe.

@_date: 2014-08-18 01:33:12
Cant happen , everyone knows that. Its the way the feds catch criminals.
 
@_date: 2014-03-03 19:41:12
Wonder how many are  sponsored?
@_date: 2014-02-09 14:50:06
nows the time to buy while its low! For those short timers , its time to sell.
@_date: 2014-03-05 17:42:22
I am positive when caveman first started trading spears for wives they did not trust the spear ;)
@_date: 2014-05-16 22:07:28
holy crap , it works - thanks
@_date: 2014-06-03 00:43:41
its been split into about 10,000 wallets
@_date: 2014-08-18 01:54:03
I sold at 620+ as soon as it was 2 sd below current on day to day transactions I sold. I buy when the volitility has stabillized for at least 3 days. Its easier to buy and sell with a plan instead of just panicing
     ----------------- R func() results ---------------------
     mean = 604.700000
     variance = 63.788889
     sd = 7.986795
     [1] 15.97359
     [1] "Selling Price"
     [1] 588.7264
     max = 620.000000 
     min = 595.000000
@_date: 2014-02-08 14:08:05
 Hope everyone spent theirs while it was at $1200
@_date: 2015-01-21 00:03:58
so thats why the price of bitcoin is so low, so NYSE can purchase low.
@_date: 2014-02-11 13:57:57
started mining when they were around 75 cents each so, it dont matter if it hits $1.00 , its all good ;)
@_date: 2016-11-07 21:42:39
bartering is the best way to not pay taxes you dumb ass. Why do you ask such stupid Q's?
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:56:54
Why are you so scared ? Cut the bullshit and let the people decide. What is your problem, boy?
@_date: 2015-04-16 18:03:15
oops. guess I thought crypt coin of any kind is good, because its all based on bitcoin
@_date: 2011-06-15 00:27:56
Anyone running Windows deserves it! Bitcoin and Linux ;)
@_date: 2015-04-01 18:50:38
Lets hope it really happens
@_date: 2011-06-15 00:29:04
It is an option if your cranking for meth - what kind of bullshiat is this anyway......
@_date: 2015-11-23 01:39:37
yes , but bitcoin doesn't even have the basic interface , now [this]( is real progress.
@_date: 2015-11-25 02:02:29
but why?
@_date: 2015-11-24 00:25:51
Not if your already a hacker , its already illegal anyway, so having your own secure channel is not up to anyone's business but your own
@_date: 2015-11-23 02:09:41
aaaah "mycelium" the app
@_date: 2015-11-23 01:50:55
I would really like to see something similar , where I can just xfer from my bitcoin address to another using smart phones. These folks in Kenya don't even have smart phones, they use very very basic phones and it works
@_date: 2015-11-23 01:11:19
Edit, here is the actual 60 minutes [show](
@_date: 2015-11-23 01:40:23
Bitpesa sounds good!
@_date: 2015-11-23 04:01:56
Your right. I would prefer to have a bitcoin app that uses my home server as the intermediary and do the transaction. This way there is no fee, only the little bit that my bitcoin base requires and I would know who logs in and out
@_date: 2015-11-23 01:56:13
name a few, I need an app that can xfer from my wallet to someone elses wallet via cell phone.
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:19:32
start a bank account and deposit money in a first world bank.
Forget Laos. Drive to the nearest international bank and deposit the amount you want to buy to get verification.
@_date: 2013-12-02 00:10:48
Any plans on putting it on github ? would be a great opensource project .... especially if folks start adding graphs charts, custom trades with other markets , bitcoin to other crypto currencies.
