Its the exact same scenario as if it went up in value. Maybe in a week's time it'll be less than that $100. Maybe it'll be worth more.

just a wee note... as of Dec 15th 2017, their minimum deposit is increasing to £2500

sounds interesting. will have to give this a look but their site isn't working for me just now

ah! this is a great visualisation on the mempool. thanks!

what a mess of voices. too many people + video calls

Similar boat here... but just be happy you've got nearly a third of a bitcoin and not none like most people.
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:40:54
Sorry to hear your story. Just curious why you didn't buy back some bitcoin?

Only minor thing I can say against it, is that it's not 4 or 5K screen ready. Looks pixellated if you have one of those monitors.

I'm waiting for a bunch of transactions to go through too. Someone showed me this link which seems like a really nice way of visualising the volume of transactions in the mempool  If I'm reading it right, once that graph's line gets down to your range (which was 167 sat/B) the blue band, 3rd from top. It'll likely go through then.
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:21:35
Oh cool, then it went through?
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:32:39
I hope you manage to access the wallet. Nice one
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:13:55
I put in a really low fee transaction just before the price went mental. It's been stuck for about 60 hours

Don't worry about not being able to buy '1' of something. Just get what you can. There's nothing special about '1'. Would it help if I said, 1 mBTC is worth $17? get one of those! there's 1 right there.

not to mention that the 3rd party will take a fee to manage your pension account :-/

Blockchain.info? They sent mine through email when I made an account in 2013. Then it looks like they re-sent one in 2016. Maybe changed their system in some way? Subject on both is "Welcome to My Wallet" if that helps your search

I've only ever bought very small amounts of BTC so the fees haven't bothered me too much. I think it's 3% on debit cards on Blockchain.info. The basic rates are higher on bittylicious.com but no extra fee works out as cheaper than Blockchain and Coinbase as you're doing bank transfers andnot using your card. I'm keen to hear from other Brits though.
