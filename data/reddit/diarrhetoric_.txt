Purchasing bitcoin today means generating revenue for bitcoin services like Coinbase, helps keep the bitcoin mining industry chugging along, and buys you a stake in the system. Having a stake in the system gives one the drive and motivation to learn the technology and desire to help the technology succeed. The early adopters face difficulties that mainstream adopters will not.
Owning a stake and seeing this thing succeed in the future means getting rewarded. Is that such a hard concept to comprehend? I don't think it is.

Imagine you store cash in a safe, and there is only one key that can open that safe, and only you possess that key. This safe is completely impenetrable. You can't lock pick it, blow it up, nothing. However this safe sits in a public park where people can see it and have easy access to it.
Well, someone else has managed to get a hold of your key because you did not safeguard it close enough, and that other person has made a copy of your key without your knowledge. The thief then uses that copy of your key to open your safe and takes all your cash out of it, and the thief then quickly puts the cash into their own impenetrable safe. Your money is now out of your hands and control and belongs to the thief.

I don't get why everyone here is arguing that ownership only exists in a realm of legalities. It really doesn't. Has the government establishment really warped people's minds to believe this?

You're over-thinking things to the point of pedantry. It *is* simply a matter of semantics.

Bter was a Chinese-based altcoin exchange. Coinbase is a U.S. based bitcoin broker, exchange, payment processor, and money transmitter that works closely with established investors and government.  Coinbase is very different from the likes of Bter and MtGox in the way that their business operates.
I mean, god damn it, if you want to acquire or sell bitcoin you *need* to trust *someone* at some stage. There's no way around it. If you are buying your bitcoin using Mycelium, you trust that the person you're meeting up with isn't going to stab you in the gut and take your phone and cash.
I trust Coinbase way more than any other entity I can buy and sell bitcoin through.

If you sign the transaction offline and the transaction is intercepted by a man in the middle attack, all that happens is the transaction fails to go through. No coins are stolen.

You don't need law to own something. If you don't understand that then you are hopeless.

If you are the only person who knows the private key that unlocks bitcoin, you own that bitcoin. Control *is* ownership. There's no need for the concept of law. I really don't understand what you're trying to get at other than a mindless rant.

The wizard ad makes me smile. The Mycelium ad makes me cringe.

What does that have to do with ownership? Government is merely acting as a reclaiming and punishment service. I don't need government to prove I own something.

Positive or negative?
