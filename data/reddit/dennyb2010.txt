I know change now and I use Binance as well but since I discovered litebit I now only purchase my crypto here. 
this broker/exchange have many advantages
1. they are really cheap, compared to other exchanges/brokers 
2. You purchase your bitcoin(and other crypto’s) with fiat
3. Your coins are sent directly to your personal wallet. Just input you wallet address and within second you got it!
I make use of it via iDeal but you can use bank transfers as well.
And the nicest thing about it is that you can reverse the transaction as well. Send your bitcoin or other crypto to ‘sell’ and receive the cash in your bank account. 
You will need to link your bank account first but that’s just for KYC purposes

It depends. First I would send via bank transfer cash to Kraken there I would purchase ETH and send it to Binance and from Binance exchange for one of my favorite coins. 
Lastly I would move my coins off the exchange into my personal wallet where I hold my private key.
