He very well could be, there is no denying that. He could have used to be zen and all together. Then when people didn’t believe him he lost the plot.
It’s happens many times.

Number 1 don’t listen to anyone. Everyone has their own best interests.
People will tell you to buy when they are selling.
People will tell you not to buy when they are buying.
I personally can tell you what I am doing - that is using cryptos as my savings account. I keep as much as I need in my everyday account and at the end of each month (I get paid monthly) the rest goes into various cryptos (including BTC as the highest %).
I will do this for the rest of this year - and I think I will be rewarded long term because of it.
Although so far it’s been the only bank account I’ve ever had that’s made negative interest ��.

They’re losing at the moment anyway. If 3k isn’t broken the bulls are officially in control.

Bitcoin doesn’t half in value - the mining block reward is divided by two, effectively doubling the value of the coins.
Block rewards are the inflation method, and miners are also paid the transaction fees.
I’m looking forward to when everyone understands the true value of bitcoin. It is that the people decide what it is worth, not a government, not a central entity, not any single person, but rather everyone who is involved in the currency.
It is a GLOBAL currency.
What was once the currency of the underworld, will soon become the currency of the world.

There’s only one legit business I know that was running rampant in 2011-2012 ��

He died. His name was Hal Finney.

It was Hal Finney.
That is obvious.

The moon ride of all moon rides.
I was predicting 60k local top this run but it looks like it might go higher

Everyone has realised the bottom is in, and the next halvening is next year.
This is bitcoins cycle, it has always done this.
Hold your bags and enjoy until 2021-2022
