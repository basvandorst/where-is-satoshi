That's questionable. All of the people I know IRL who were even slightly into Bitcoin have completely lost interest over the past year. The price drop is hard to handle for most people who aren't either ideologically motivated, or fortunate enough to be an early adopter. To be fair this is just my personal experience and I'm only talking about five people or so. They still have Coinbase accounts, blockchain.info wallets, and what have you, but for all intents and purposes are no longer "bitcoiners".

I'm not sure I haven't transferred money directly to either of those exchanges. For me Coinbase is just far too convenient once you're verified. I click a few buttons on my phone and I'm done, although I do have the old Coinbase app. I've heard the new one no longer allows purchasing through the app. There's a 1% fee using Coinbase but the convenience is worth it in my opinion, and you can then just send your coins to whatever exchange you wish to trade on. 
@_date: 2014-09-27 03:14:04
Personally, I considered getting a trezor just because it's a cool gadget to have. I've paid more for dinner at a nice restaurant so in a way I *might* be able to justify the expense. Looking at it pragmatically though it really doesn't make any sense for me. It seems you not only have to have enough coins to secure to make it a worth while investment, but you also need to be uninformed enough to not know how to secure your coins in traditional ways. Most early adopters who'd fall into the former most likely don't fall into the latter so I'm not sure what the overlap is there. I think it's a great product and I don't doubt the R&amp;D justify the cost but I worry it really is just another cool gadget, at least for the time being.

I didn't downvote him but it seems to me his situation was different. OP mentioned using the Gyft app to purchase a gift card which then automatically opens Blockchain and fills in the appropriate amount and address. Gyft was calling for .0843 BTC to be sent but since Blockchain was set to "bits" it only sent .0843 bits, rather than making the proper conversion. What did was simply open the app and send bits to an address of his choosing, manually typing in the amount I assume.

I haven't heard of anyone else receiving theirs yet but a lot of people donated last year and should be getting them soon. Maybe someone will sell you one? I wouldn't want to make the decision now but I'd consider selling mine for Bitcoin since it's a little too big and it's white, which means I'll probably just end up staining and ruining it. As far as buying one direct I'm not sure if it's possible at this point.
@_date: 2014-10-01 07:42:19

It's 330 am for me right now I'm also ready for bed. Just a note though... As far as the tagline goes, somehow working the phrase "They'll never know..." comes to mind. Or maybe "what you spend your money on is your business, keep it that way"

I used to be a bartender and I'll vouch for this. I'm in the U.S. by the way, where tipping is considered customary to 99% of the population. When someone leaves just the coin change as a tip there's definitely an undertone of "It's not worth my time to scoop those coins up off the bar but I'm sure you'll appreciate it. Thanks for the service!" It's at least mildly insulting. To add to that, over the years I've seen lots of people leave a single penny as a tip just to send a message. If someone leaves no tip at all the waitress will most likely think you're just cheap and don't tip anyone ever. By leaving a penny the customer's basically saying "I do tip my servers, I just don't think you're worth any more than that."

To move the market a considerable amount would require a lot of coins and that person would pay a lot of fees to the exchange in doing so. There are also many players in the market so his efforts would likely be thwarted by the actions of others. As they buy and raise the price others will be more tempted to sell. Basically, as more and more people get involved in the market it becomes a lot harder to pull off. If I had 1000's of coins to play with I might think about ways to manipulate the market but, personally, I sure as hell wouldn't let an exchange hold that many coins of mine, they'd be in cold storage.

Does anyone know exactly how Coinbase and Bitpay liquidate their coins? For example, I'm pretty sure if I buy something for $324.99 using Coinbase as the processor, there won't immediately be a sell order of $324.99 on BitStamp. I've been staying away from the charts for a while now so I so I haven't noticed myself but I still read enough to see lots of talk about "whales" putting up buy and sell walls. What are the chances that these whales are actually Coinbase and Bitpay? Or do they settle everything behind the scenes?
@_date: 2014-07-30 02:16:04
Yeah if you're in the US Coinbase is the easiest way to go. You can always just transfer the coins to an exchange if you're interested in actively trading although I'd recommend starting off small if you do. It's easy to get burnt pretty badly. What exchanges require a $2000 minimum? That's news to me. Also before someone rudely tells you I'll politely tell you... It's Bitcoin not BitCoin :)
@_date: 2014-08-16 01:35:24
I'm with you. I seriously doubt those who are holding 1000+ coins are rebuying after each purchase like many of the small guys do. It's not the sole cause for the downward slump we've been in but it certainly isn't helping any.

I tell them there's a difference between *investing in* (holding) and *using* (transferring value) Bitcoin. Those who *invest* in Bitcoin are simply making a bet that there will more demand in the future by people who want to *use* it. 
They're free to not make that same bet if they so choose as it's certainly not for everyone.

How sure can we be that it was actually him seeing as it wasn't a signed message? I'm not saying it wasn't him but I'm skeptical simply because forum accounts can be compromised.

You guys are so concerned about trolls and paid shills doing damage to Bitcoin's reputation, but why don't you guys take a look at yourselves? Some of you with your persecution complexes are far more off-putting than any of these so-called trolls could ever be. I've been a Bitcoiner for just under two years now. I bought my first coins within a week of first hearing about it and immediately fell in love. There was so much to learn about that I'd never been introduced to before. I'd spend hours daily reading these forums, learning about encryption and how to create my own bootable OS's, how markets work, and so much more. I've met a few cool people along the way too. Lately I'm finding myself becoming completely disillusioned with this community though. Perhaps it's just a vocal minority, but this minority is *very* vocal. Some of you guys are absolutely bat-shit insane and that really means something coming from me as I have a tendency to relate to the oddballs in society. All these constant cries of paid shills and trolls are just too much for me. I swear some of you guys sound like paranoid meth heads or something. The fact that not a single hint of criticism can be mentioned without being downvoted to oblivion and attacked is why this place is often nothing more than an echo chamber. I have a feeling that's how some of you want it though; just a big pump fest. Well, just so you know people can see through that. What you need to understand is that many of these detractors are only here to counter against the lunacy that runs rampant in here. Take this very thread for example. I see a lot of the usual buttcoiners posting in here. Ask yourself why...

Here's my problem. You're basically saying that if a trezor is 100% secure, then the average Joe has more than a 12% chance of losing their coins using whatever other form of cold storage they choose. Me? I don't buy that. I mean, I love Bitcoin, but can you imagine if a prepaid CC tried charging $120 "theft insurance" on a prepaid $1000 card? There would be outrage! I think the number is much higher than $1000.

I had an idea similar to this a while back. It was more for "micro-services" though. Posts would be something along the lines of "I'll give 1000 bits to the first person to tell me a joke that actually makes me lol" or "Does anyone know the name of the movie where such and such happened? $2 bounty."  
Flair could be given to any OP who has a track history of paying up to help build trust. People who get screwed on the fluctuation of BTC and are now $1 or $2 short for a purchase could be directed here to try to earn small amounts. I could see it cutting down on some of the phony 0-day "I just got my first Bitcoin" accounts that many believe are just a ploy for tips.

Personally as long as trolls are civil I welcome their dissenting opinions. I enjoy the discussion.

As far as I know exchanges wouldn't allow you to purchase for 1000 if there are sell orders at 580. The lowest sell orders would get filled first. If I had money on a few exchanges I'd make test buys of .001 BTC @ $1000/coin just to make sure I'm right about this. If I'm wrong hopefully someone comes along and corrects me.

I see this was already answered while I was typing but I'll put it here anyway. 
I'll leave the first couple questions to someone who was around in the very beginning as it would only be conjecture on my part to try to answer. As far as market cap is concerned I think of it in terms of how much value people are willing to hold in a given coin. Market cap = number of coins in circulation x last price on the exchange. If such-and-such-coin is worth $2 each and there are 5 million of these coins world wide, it has a market cap of 10 million. Many of those coins would've been mined for free (aside from hardware and electricity costs) or bought at a price much lower than $2. In fact it's possible that only one coin was actually bought for $2 if that happens to be the price of the last coin sold on an exchange. Someone could then come along and buy a bunch of coins and drive the price up to $2.50 each and the market cap would now be at 12.5 million but rest assured 2.5 million dollars didn't change hands to get it there.

That actually makes sense I suppose, they do share the same title. I've never posted to reddit in that way. At the time it seemed fishy though because he already had the other post of his own that linked to the same album, and that one was already picking up steam vote-wise. I was mostly just confused as to why he'd do that.
@_date: 2014-01-08 00:34:30
I agree with you there. I may not have been clear but I'm not talking about trusting them to return bitcoins. I mean to ask why is it that people trust them with information? For example, I'm sure a lot of dark-market vendors use mixers but what's to say the DEA or NSA isn't running the mixer themselves? They know the algorithm used and can trace every coin that goes through it. If I worked for one of those agencies that's what I'd do anyway, create a mixing service.

Fair enough but those daytraders as well as bots helped in the sense that they provided liquidity.

[Here's a link to Bitstamp's order book]( At this point in time it looks like it would take about 2000 coins being bought to bring the price up to 400 and around 4000 coins bough to bring the price up to 420.

I'm thinking a commercial that shows highlights the privacy that using Bitcoin allows for. Along the theme of "you don't want that showing up on your cc statement" but minus the dildos, anal beads and penis enlargement pills. 
First couple scenes show a man Christmas shopping for his wife wandering into different stores. First he buys her a pair of shoes, then a necklace in a jewelry store, and lastly a voucher for a day spa. 
Next scene shows the wife going through some mail and opening up the credit card bill. Of course she sees all these transactions and knows exactly what she's getting. 
Final scene they're sitting around the Christmas tree and the husband hands her the largest box. Without even opening it she exclaims "Honey thank you so much you know how badly I've wanted these shoes!" and puts the box down, still wrapped. Next the husband hands her the smaller box and she yelps "Oh my god it's beautiful! I've always wanted a necklace with a topaz pendent!" She puts the box down unopened. Confused the husband hands her the card and without skipping a beat she goes "Oh I love that spa! I've been dying for a good facial for months!" and wraps her arms around her still confused husband. 
Voiceover: *Should've used Bitcoin*
Edit: This is probably an idea better suited for family friendly television. If you want a viral online video, go with the dildos, anal beads and penis enlargement pills.

They only require ID if you wish to trade coin into fiat. Bitcoin to alt trades only require that you select South Carolina as your home state when registering. Personally, I wouldn't risk lying about my residency to gain access. I'd be afraid that someday down the road the bar may be raised and you'll need further verification to withdraw coins. It would be a serious pain in the ass to move 500 miles just to get a South Carolina ID.

As I understand the minimum transaction amount allowed is .00005430. One microbit is equivalent to .000001. I'm not 100% on this part but I *believe* what that means is to send that microbit you'd need to attach a fee of .0000533. Obviously there's very little incentive to pay such a fee to send an amount that small. Hopefully someone comes along and confirms or corrects because I'm going by memory and never personally tried to send such a small amount.

I'm sure they'll be traded publicly over the blockchain. Would you buy coins and keep them at the same address knowing the government still held that private key? They'll definitely be transferred. It'll be interesting to see where they end up and in what sized blocks they're transferred. Even if one entity buys them all I wouldn't be surprised if the transaction was broken up into much smaller ones to different addresses. Time will tell. I can't wait to see!

I don't really get the hate. I've heard the argument that people will think that Bitcoins are physical *coins* but for most of the population I don't really think that's the case. Most people out there simply don't get what it is and any of those who are actually interested in learning will quickly realize they aren't physical coins. At least when people see that picture it's helping to engrain Bitcoins as a "thing" in their minds. If not that photo, what would you recommend instead?

It's been a few months but I used to have a recurring buy set up through Coinbase to buy $20 worth daily, just as in your first example. You just need to change the value from BTC to USD to have your purchase denominated in dollars.

Check out Circle.com and Coinbase.com if you're looking to use a credit card/bank account to make your purchase. Neither are available in all countries so it depends on where you live. I've never bothered looking into Circle since I'm already verified on Coinbase so I can't really help much with them, but I can tell you Coinbase has a waiting period of a few days until you actually receive your coins unless you're fully verified, which requires linking an additional credit card on top of your bank account. 
@_date: 2014-09-27 04:17:11
Yeah for some that's true but I'd still implore those to just buy 120 more worth of Bitcoin if they believe that's the case. The percentages still add up.

There are varying opinions but I think [Electrum]( is pretty great. When you set it up you'll get a string of 12 random words which can be used to back up your wallet. It'll set you up with some receiving addresses and all you need to do is send your coins to one of them. I consider this to be a hot wallet, meaning you only hold coins there that you plan to spend, and in a worse case scenario could afford to lose. It's generally not safe to keep too many coins on a computer due to malware and such. For larger amounts of coins I'd recommend looking into paper wallets or perhaps a trezor.

@_date: 2014-10-04 09:59:57
This is an old post but I'll attempt to address it anyway. The way I'm looking at it is the trezor is basically like owning an insurance policy. Previously, your coins may not have been secure but now that you own and use a trezor, they are. Awesome. If you only own $1000 worth of coins though it wouldn't make sense to pay more than $100 for insurance unless you thought you had greater than 10% chance of losing your coins without that insurance policy, ie the trezor. Does that explain my perspective better?

True. I'd go with "notmeth". 
@_date: 2014-09-27 04:03:14
Yeah I agree with that, the trezor certainly is useful. I just think it's silly for the average joe to be expected to pay 120 to insure 10. I'm not sure how exactly to quantify it but certainly it's not rational to buy a trezor to protect under a certain amount. What that amount is, really is up to ones own risk tolerance and ability to secure their coins in another way. I was just responding saying that I believe that amount is over 1000, given the trezor's current price of 120.

Is this the general idea... You deposit bitcoin with them. If you wish to lock it they instantly sell your coins and you then hold a cash balance. When you're ready to spend, they buy the coins back at whatever the exchange rate is and then you can use them. Isn't this basically like holding a cash balance on an exchange, with the minor difference that now your balance can also be denominated in gold instead of cash?

One question I've gotten when trying to explain Bitcoins to those who are unfamiliar is "Why not just use a credit card or cash?" I'd recommend including some of the benefits like being able to make borderless transactions, accepting payments without going through a payment processor, maintaining a degree of pseudo-anonymity, micro-transactions, etc.  Good job so far though!

True, but securing a paper wallet is a good first step. M of n seems a bit advanced for someone who's moving their coins off an exchange for the first time.

Is it possible that you end up receiving funds with that address at some point in the future since it's now part of your Blockchain wallet? It's not actually swept but rather imported? I don't use them much anymore but if I recall correctly there was an archive function for addresses you no longer want to use. I'd recommend archiving that address since someone else now has the private key, whether they realize it or not. Or just burn the blockchain account completely. This thought had crossed my mind in the past since I've used the same feature but i also destroyed the paper wallet so it wasn't as much of a concern as it may be to you. 
@_date: 2014-05-10 08:43:32

Oh I agree and I've considered getting one, admittedly mostly for the novelty. I sleep pretty securely with what paper wallets I have in my safe. If I was sitting on 100,000 worth I'd probably want a better solution. I'm just disagreeing with the 1000 part, as I don't think it's rational to spend 120 to secure so little.

That's hard to say. Coinbase is one of the most trustworthy places to hold your coins in my opinion but unless you hold the private keys yourself you don't really have Bitcoins, you have an IOU that says they'll give you Bitcoins, if that makes sense. I think it comes down to your own abilities to secure your computer. I'm a real proponent of holding your coins yourself but you must be sure your computer's security is up to par. Personally, I have a dedicated netbook that I use for spending coins and paper wallets that I use for my savings. Your level of security should depend on how much money you have invested in Bitcoin and how much it would hurt to lose it. On a last note make sure you keep that 12 word seed somewhere safe.

I don't buy into the theory that bankers are spreading FUD to keep the price down. The fact is demand is down because Bitcoin just isn't a viable option for most people. If we put aside the fact that Bitcoin requires a certain level of technological prowess, the fact is that it's just too volatile to be trusted by most people, and its usefulness rarely outweighs that fault. Personally, I think it's really cool to have money saved on a flash drive for example, but I'm not ok with watching my net worth decrease faster than I can earn money simply because I'm holding my savings in Bitcoin. That's why I sold my coins a while ago. If ever I find a compelling reason where buying and using Bitcoin makes sense I'll gladly jump back in, but for now I'm cool with holding my $10-20 worth of coins.

@_date: 2015-05-17 07:43:56
Yeah I agree it's not going away anytime soon, like e-gold did. Personally I'm no longer interested in investing in Bitcoin, though, as I feel the majority of coins are being bought as speculation. I doubt the price is artificially being held down by bankers or governments, if anything it's being artificially propped up by hoarders restricting available supply. Before I put any significant amount of money into it again I'd like to see more real world applications where everyday people have a reason to use it regularly. I think the volatility is a huge hurdle that average folk aren't willing to deal with if they're to use it as an everyday currency, and I'm one of those people. If that means I miss out on gains because the price rises again in the meantime, I'm ok with that.

It still needs to spread though. If the Bitcoin wizard was something that spread through the internet I'd be inclined to agree but as it stands it's completely centralized. Reddit shows the ad, users see it, and that's it. At a basic level the ad spreads information from one person to another making it meme-like but by that definition nearly all communication could be considered a meme.
At any rate it's nice to see someone familiar with the original definition of meme. The Selfish Gene is one of my favorite books. You've inspired me to look through my bookcase to see if I still have it and fortunately I do. I'll be doing some traveling tomorrow I think I'll bring that one with me.

It's a shame. Many of these legal highs can be just as addictive or harmful as some of the illegal ones but I've got a good friend who kicked an opiate addiction with the help of kratom, rather than going on methadone which is way more damaging. I'd be opposed to any legislation against it for that reason but I especially believe it isn't the duty of payment processors to decide what **legal** purchases someone should be allowed to make.

In case you're not aware…your comment looks really bad for Bitcoin. Sure, it's possible that your efforts could help convince someone to drop 25k on bitcoin but for anyone on the fence who's reading your comment it helps to reinforce the idea that Bitcoin is a pyramid scheme desperate for "new money".  There's no guarantee that this person will buy 25k worth of BTC but it's absolutely guaranteed that people will read your comment. The net effect is negative to achieving your goal of pumping the price.

The fact is there just aren't many people who use bitcoin. Assuming there are 1/2 million users then roughly 1 in 14,000 people worldwide use Bitcoin. Do donut shops even get that many unique customers in a year? When you also consider the number of people whose only interest in Bitcoin is playing the markets or buying drugs it's not too surprising that random brick and mortar stores aren't getting all that much in Bitcoin sales. To be honest, if a donut shop claimed to be getting $1,000's of dollars worth of Bitcoin sales a year I'd assume they were using the business to launder their own coins. 
Having said all that I am surprised it took this long to get even a single Bitcoin-paying customer. There's a bar in my city that accepts it and I went there a few times just for the novelty. Each time it was a real headache because it involved waiting ten minutes for the bartender to find the ipad and then listen to him bust my balls about paying with monopoly money while I tried desperately to get my spotty service to connect so I could complete the transaction. I've been friends with the bartender for years so it was all in good fun, but if I wasn't I would've felt particularly awkward being the asshole that wastes so much time during a busy happy hour instead of just paying with cash, which is exactly how I pay when I go there nowadays. 
To add to this, one of the waitresses flat out told me the owners decision to accept Bitcoin was a pr move. I mean, it definitely worked somewhat for them because I dropped around $500 there I probably wouldn't have otherwise, and from what I'm told they've had about 5 other customers who occasionally come in too. 
Ps while I'm telling my Bitcoin-brick-and-mortar story there's another issue people need to understand if they're going to pay with Bitcoin. This applies only to bars, but many require you to hand over a credit card if you want to open a tab. Apparently some of the other patrons raised a fuss over this because they thought they were exempt from this policy simply because they were paying in Bitcoin. Just something for people to keep in mind if you ever find yourself going to whatever bar in your area accepts Bitcoin.

I'm bored so I figured I'd do a little digging around in old Changetip related posts in [Changetip is causing bitcoin to go viral right now]( (406 upvotes)
Let's take a look at the user accounts of the top three comments in that thread...
1) [weatherman35]( last few posts have been in and I get the feeling he's not so interested in bitcoin as he is in getting shit for free. Whatever though, it's not particularly relevent here. 
2) [mrtechjunkie]( stopped posting four months ago and damn near every one of his comments was related to tipping. Changetip shill?
3) [Magichuman]( had eight posts and every single one was either about tipping, or in a thread about tipping. Changetip shill?
My problem is that this post pumped Bitcoin itself, as opposed to just promoting Changetip. The post was made on 11/5 and as you can see in [this chart]( covering 11/5 - 11/15  there was definitely an unsustainable rise in price in the days following. I can't help but think that Changetip may have had something to do with that, and that there may be a few people who are salty over being duped into thinking Bitcoin was "catching on".

It's hard for me to understand how people *really* believe this isn't a problem. I can only imagine they're either trying to convince themselves that it's not, or convince others. For all the hate that pre-mined altcoins get around here everyone seems so willing to overlook Satoshi's stash. Considering the relatively small amount of coins circulating in real commerce it can be argued his coins, should they become active, would effectively represent way more than 5% of the total Bitcoin economy.
Not that I think this will ever happen, but if tomorrow Satoshi sent all his coins to 1BitcoinEaterAddressDontSendf59kuE I'd be willing to bet the price would get a huge boost. Markets hate uncertainty and that's exactly what his stash is, an uncertainty.

Assuming this screenshot was taken today, HonestCocaine is selling a kilo for about $55,000. That's way more than you'd expect to pay anywhere else in the US. [[Source]]( What this tells me is that anyone buying that kilo likely doesn't have the real world connections to buy it in person, where it would cost about half as much. This lends credence to the idea that people buying online would likely not have bought at all without that option, thereby increasing the total amount of supply to hit the streets. Most people in this thread are capable of going onto one of these sites and having an ounce of molly, meth, coke, whatever shipped to their house right now. To any of you who do order bulk amounts like that, can you honestly say you had that sort of connection prior to SR and the like?

I bought my first Bitcoins about two years ago within a week of hearing about it for the first time. Not everyone was subscribed to a an obscure mailing list for cryptographers back in '08, involved with buying drugs online in early '11, or whatever other reason people come to find out about Bitcoin. 
Although the math is sound the distribution is seriously flawed IMO. 
Considering the massive sum of coins issued early on in Bitcoin's history vs. the relatively few people who were aware of its existence at the time it becomes clear why some people see it as a pyramid scheme of sorts.

I discovered bitcoin when they were at around $50 and rising a couple months back. I convinced one of my friends to get involved but by the time he was able to purchase some they had risen to around $140. He was mostly interested in making an investment and after they crashed he pretty much lost interest. Initially I was in it for the same reason. That's all changed now. Discovering bitcoin has been a driving force behind an incredible amount of learning I've done recently. If they were to be valued at $0 tomorrow I wouldn't regret a thing about what money I've lost for I've gained knowledge which is priceless. Like OP this is my hobby and I don't mind paying money for a hobby, especially one that encourages me to expand my horizons. I haven't pushed my interest on any more of my friends but I've made enough mentions that I know I'll be their go-to guy for knowledge as bitcoin gains a bit more traction and becomes integrated into the mainstream.

I believe the future of bitcoin to reach the masses relies on the development of apps that don't even display the amount in bitcoin. For example if you decide to bitcoin-tip someone a dollar it doesn't matter how much that equates to in bitcoin. That's all handled on the backend. The fact is that bitcoin is an attractive purchase to many people for many reasons and it doesn't matter how much one bitcoin is worth. What matters is the ultimate amount of worth that people would like to be represented in bitcoin worldwide divided by the amount of bitcoin in existence. The marketcap if you will. I for example enjoy having a certain amount of my savings invested in a digital currency which I have absolute control of. I'm sure many others feel this way as well. Many people feel the price of one of these internet "coins" is ridiculous because we've been conditioned to believe a coin is something worth less than a dollar. Lately I've been seeing it more as what I've described above. Take the total amount of value people would like to hold in bitcoin and divide it by the arbitrary number of bitcoins that we have in existence and that is what a bitcoin is worth.

I won't get into too much detail in a public forum but I was a user for years and a hardcore addict for two. This was six years ago. Thankfully I managed not to be homeless but with my lifestyle at the time I was always one bad decision away from sleeping under a bridge. It's due to compassionate people like yourself who refuse to write off our struggling brothers and sisters as lost causes that I'm doing as well as I am these days. It's not much but I want to contribute +$5
Happy Holidays!

Exactly. I suspect it's been the rest of the world who's selling bitcoins to US citizens on Mt Gox, who are then selling them at a loss on other exchanges. Luckily I didn't have any bitcoin or cash in Mt Gox but if I had I may have been willing to take a loss this way

I'm no economist but here's how I visualize it... I have an apple pie. I sell 7 tickets which are redeemable for a slice of that pie at the fair next weekend and I keep one ticket for myself. You bought one of them and at that time you "owned"  1/8th of that pie but over the course of the next week I print up two more tickets and keep them for myself. By the time the fair comes around  your ticket is only redeemable for 1/10th of the pie while I now get to have 3/10. Now imagine instead of pie we're talking about a commodity, perhaps an ounce of gold. Imagine I keep printing additional tickets (money) every week that represent ownership of that gold. It's not that the value of the gold itself has changed it's just that you need more of those tickets to be redeemable for the same amount of gold.  I'm printing up more tickets and keeping them for myself therefore stealing the value that your tickets once had.
value of 1$=1/x where x is the number of dollars in circulation. The higher x is the lower the value becomes
I'm preemptively saying I know we're no longer on the gold standard in case that's how it came across.

I wish everyone here understood this. Everyone is sure that Amazon accepting bitcoins=$10,000 bitcoin (or whatever). I personally think it's the other way around. Once we've worked out all the kinks and more companies come along and build on top of the protocol we may someday see $10,000 bitcoins. If that happens then we may see companies as large as Amazon start accepting Bitcoin. One step at a time people. 
@_date: 2013-05-10 01:40:47
I imagine you'd need to be playing with some real big numbers to make it worth the time and effort to make anything more than pocket change doing this. I wouldn't want $1000 tied up for a month to make ten or twenty bucks. In the time it takes to withdraw from Gox and deposit into BTC-e again I'd be afraid to miss a good trading opportunity.

Exactly. Scale back to at least an hour+ to decide if you want to buy in or not and then look at the 5 or 15s to decide the moment to buy in.

That just it. It's a fairly niche market and it seems to me that most who get paid in bitcoin either run an online store or are somehow involved in programming. I want to know how the rest of us can truly become part of the bitcoin economy

I know you're selling small amounts so any reasonable person shouldn't be too bothered but do you have any worries about parents complaining to the school?

This was a restaurant I was bartending in. I still consider her to be a friend and didn't take any offense, I was just thankful to get it back. I see a parallel here between what she did and what did. He knew that if he didn't take it someone less honest would. The way I see it he was protecting those bitcoins not stealing them. 
His other motivation, I'm sure, was for the absolute fucking thrill of it. I would've done the same thing including the part where he offered to give them back.

I'm curious, what website? Also, does anyone know how many donations Mozilla has received to date? I'm not saying it'll necessarily scale but you've upped you're donations by ~1% accepting Bitcoin. That becomes a significant amount as the numbers get larger. $1.50 may not justify the time you spent setting everything up but for Mozilla it may be worthwhile. I'm also thinking there's a lot of overlap between Bitcoin supporters and Mozilla supporters so it's possible they'll see even greater contributions.
@_date: 2013-05-09 04:10:01
Even if no one actually panics the price will still drop because many of us have learned to sell whenever Mt Gox gets DDoSed and buy back cheap coins later. It's sort of a self-fulfilling prophecy. BTC-E has remained relatively stable through this one though

I once left my wallet with about 800 bucks in it laying out at work. Dumb, I know. My manager took it and let me freak out for a bit before giving it back to me saying "Let this be a lesson, not everyone is as honest as I am."

True story. My friend who got burned last April and lost interest wanted to invest again (and did) but he made a comment about wanting at least a whole coin. He has about 500 to throw in. He took half a coin off the market but this could be a problem in getting people to buy in at this point. On the other hand he'll very likely continue to buy as he saves up money no matter the price until he has an entire coin to hold onto.
