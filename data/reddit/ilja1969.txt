A nice run has been initiated, it'll require some patience to settle above 10.5k. I'm eager for the rally afterwards to finally pierce that 12k barrier.

It certainly won’t affect my opinion about digital currencies and am definitely not worried.
I believe these men are comparable to those 2 on the balcony of the muppet show, so whatever they say is meaningless to me. Their behaviour nonetheless confirms the animosity they have toward a groundbreaking concept, and are willing to blindly insult anyone considering it’s potential. I do get irritated I must admit to see the same people constantly reappearing all over the news commenting about stuff they don’t and never will understand. Journalism at it’s best...
Thanks for your comment anyway.

I find Buffet and Munger calling it scumball activity particularly offensive in that it’s pointed not towards the technology itself but directly to it’s users. Like countless others I use it for buying on Newegg and Overstock, I trade it regularly for investing in other assets, and firmly believe in it’s potential. Am I therefore entitled to be insulted by someone who invested in companies like Monsanto or Procter&amp;Gamble? How do you call activity like investing in companies who have no sense of moral or ethical values?

$165mln of roughly 150Bln as both currencies' market cap at the moment makes up for 0.11% so no big deal.
Even if he decides to sell, he releases it in batches so as not to disrupt the price to much.
Isn't it a good thing that, even if defunct, an exchange still maintains it's efforts to repay it's investors?

Buffet and his demented friends' comments is having little effect, people are slowly realizing they're off the hook. The conferences in May will give real insight to people still new to btc, enough with ignorant craptalk.

Been using overstock for a while now, biggest item so far was a sofa, although delivery was 2 days later than promised. Newegg works great too for computers etc... and their catalogue is rapidly expanding. Ditched my Visa card 2 months ago. If amazon and co don't follow they may regret it soon.
This will become the standard.

Sure, if that’s what you’re into. Better than to show up with cash on the corner of a street waiting for a dealer. Governments will never admit it but since you can buy it on the deep web you now have the possibility to buy stuff from the underground market without getting stabbed and to have a better product.
Stay safe.

I remember the transition from all european currencies to euro which happened 2 decades ago, older people tend to be reluctant, as with smartphones and social media, in the end everybody gets used to it. I doubt Buffet and Charlie Munger will though, probably still using the telegraph to contact each other.

I wonder how the crypto world will react to the Binance hack, I fear all the gains made in april could vanish in no time.

Any asset can lose it's entire value, many BTC enthousiasts somehow tend to believe it simply cannot fail, ignoring the possibility of a global web shutdown, a devastating virus or any other radical event. I still have piles of metal coins lying in a drawer dating from before the Euro, other than their pure value in weight or sentimental crap they remain worthless pieces of rubbish.  
That said in current circumstances $0 seems unlikely, a retest of the $4500 and $2500 levels next year's first half seems more plausible, eventually 20k again but I'd be surprised if it happens before end 2019.

Ready to place some orders my wallet can handle but just for betting fun really.  
buy order set at $5400 with a sell target at $5950  
After that we'll see, $4400 is definitely an option, whatever...as long as it stays entertaining I don't see the harm in trading.
Leave your insults and expertise below as usual, any others willing to share their humble bets most welcome too!

Look, if he says it can't fall any further, it can't fall any further.
