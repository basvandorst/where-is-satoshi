What? The main reason it jumps up is because there is less supply entering the market each day... Granted not all miners sell right away, but it's still basic supply and demand that causes a rise.

Won't go out once Elon's global satellite internet network goes online in a few years.

You could still divide it over 30 days and buy a part each day.

There's a fund you can buy(GBTC) . It charges fees and is a higher price than spot but its the best option I found for a self managed retirement account.

Yes but do the math, granted it all depends on how many miles you drive and cost of gas/electric, but a lot of people pay $400/month for the car and then $200-300/month for gas vs $600/month for a Tesla with free to $50 more in electric to charge. So you are basically breaking even monthly when you compare a 4 cyl, maybe 200 hp gas engine to a car with 300 hp/TQ at 1 mph and a 0-60 around 5 seconds... Most engines sound like an old man with shit in his throat nowadays to me when comparable prices. Yes a Ferrari engine sounds great but that's $200K+

This is what most people do during the bull runs... Then they stop during the downturns...

Most of that is true for the luxury Teslas(S &amp; X) but the new Model 3 is $35K in the US, that's about the same price as the Chevy electric, but with more range, preformance, size, and access to supercharging network. Just like bitcoin if you only read the headlines you would think its going under. 
Over 10-15 years a new $40K Tesla is equal to a new $20-25K gas car plus the gas usage. Not even counting maintenance like transmissions, belts, oil, etc and then you get a really fun technology inspired car to drive vs a base car.

My Tesla says otherwise to electric is dead. It's the best car I have ever driven for a day to day vehicle.
Also the less money spent on gas goes to buying more bitcoin!
Replace what you just said about EVs but with bitcoin, it will sound very similar and media will say the same lines. Guess we will see what happens.

Isn't the type R $35-40K? So only 2 of those. Haha
@_date: 2019-06-22 23:52:00
What would change it sooner, would be some app or use case more than it is now. That would bring in a mass adoption that would pump up the price.
@_date: 2019-06-19 02:41:19
Yes but have you tried pro or was gdax? It's spot price or you can put in a limit order with $1 or less fees
@_date: 2019-06-07 12:11:27
How slow is your internet?
@_date: 2019-06-19 21:41:00
Didn't porsche already come out and say the base was $80K? Now I easily see with options and the top model easily being in the $150-200K range.

Gas engines are the way of the dollar, thought we were more future looking here?
@_date: 2019-09-27 02:59:34
You wouldn't be bitching if it went up 20%.
@_date: 2019-09-30 23:13:30
It will work for what you want out of it...
@_date: 2019-09-02 18:37:42
Yeah who goes to a bank for a $2K business loan? Use a credit card for that.
Its like trying to get a $20K mortgage, it's not worth their time to even deal with it.

This is only if every miner is selling every coin they mine.
@_date: 2019-05-23 23:19:23
The issue is liability with movement. Yeah it's great when it goes up, but what happens if it drops 30% in 2 weeks or more.

It's not the picnic talk, it's a 3 day holiday weekend. They are off on their mega yachts on vacation. This is their side gambling/investing.
@_date: 2019-05-13 23:10:46
I theory then they should see that they have ideally low fees and zero fraud/charge backs.
@_date: 2019-05-27 00:33:38
If it hits 10K by Monday night then we are in a true rally and I wouldn't sell, if we hang around high 8s, low 9s. I would sell as it was mostly a short term bump from the holiday weekend talk with friends and beers. Then buy in after everything settled back down.
@_date: 2019-05-27 01:11:42
Guess we will see.
