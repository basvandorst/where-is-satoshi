What about Quadriga? Ive used them for a couple years now, they've always been great.

Like I said.. just check the average to make sure you aren't overpaying. VOS is always within a few dollars of the average within Canadian exchanges in my experience so it's a non-issue.
I don't disagree with your statement, only that high volume is only relevant if you're going to be making large purchases where you wipe an orderbook or engage in day trading. If all you want to do is buy $100 worth of BTC every month there's no reason to avoid an exchange with lower volume as long as you reference the market average beforehand.

For 8 million dollars that's a pretty ugly house. The island part is cool though.

That was a surprisingly excellent image as response. I chortled.

It sounds like this basically just requires any exchange to register with and abide by FINTRAC regulations. If i'm not mistaken pretty much all major Canadian exchanges already do this voluntarily.. do they not? So isn't this just business as usual albeit with clearer guidelines?

It's mechanisms like this that make me wonder over all about real transactional volume for Bitcoin. Companies like Coinbase probably make up the bulk of "real" bitcoin transactions that happen in the commerce world, and yet most of these transactions are probably done internally and off-chain so that you'd never see it. People constantly say that blockchain transactions have been stagnant over the last year, but I suspect actual transactions taking place are far far higher than what we're seeing, it's just all happening off chain now so there's no real way to account for it.

This.... is unfortunate, and rather upsetting. Starting to question whether I should continue using Multibit now. I like it because it's light weight and doesnt require the entire blockchain, but this is a pretty horrible bug that I have zero desire to encounter.
Best of luck to you OP, I really hope you can get this sorted!

That's well within variation between various exchanges so that could also be 1-3% less rather than more. Unless you want to have an account on every exchange just to get the best rate at any given time then it's not worth the effort involved. 
Have a look at the spread here:  Even with exchanges with high volume there's considerable variation between them. Taking your advice if you were to use the highest volume exchange right this moment (bitstamp) it would actually cost you more compared to the lower volume ones. Granted that's not always the case, but you see my point. 
Long story short, if you want the best price, reference and compare. High volume is no guarantee of better price, only a more stable price, which is relevant to traders or big purchasers but not someone who buys once in a blue moon.

Easiest way is to sell them on QuadrigaCX ( or Vault of Satoshi ( You'll need to make an account and wait for verification, but once set up its very easy. Quadriga is my preference since their withdrawal options are free.
@_date: 2014-05-04 16:42:25
That's the most hilarious part about it. Just sheer incompetence. 
Meanwhile you've got companies like Bitmain that ship ASIC's within days of an order placed, routinely offer discounts on hardware, and if you miss out on heavy price drops, offer you coupons to (mostly) make up the difference so you don't feel like you missed out too badly.
How anyone else manages to stay in business next to those guys is beyond me.

I wouldn't pay for it period personally. Utorrent has gotten so bloated over the years. For something that advertises its self as being small and efficient it's become the complete opposite to me. I've been using qBittorrent lately and found it to be a vastly superior experience overall. Small, quick and easy to use and is basically what utorrent used to be.
@_date: 2014-04-08 17:53:08
I like electrum from what i've seen, the only thing that puts me off is the reliance on external servers for the blockchain which leaves future usability a big question mark. Also one of my favorite features of Multibit is the live, customizable currency ticker so you have an idea on conversion rates before making transfers, I wish all wallets would add such a feature.
Nonetheless, after seeing all this, i'll be moving my coins out of multibit and probably to electrum. Even if it's a 1 in 100, 000 chance of it happening, it's simply not a risk I can take, and I suspect others will feel the same way too, especially as your holdings increase.

I understand why they want to call it Dark market and it makes perfect sense to anyone who routinely uses bitcoin or other darknet services such as Tor, but this is terrible from a marketing perspective with the general public IMO. 
We might know what it means, but when the average person hears about it, they'll hear dark market and think shady, underground, illegal.. and bitcoin will be seen in the same light with it. Not really ideal. 
Technically, the last 3 are probably true since an unregulated market will undoubtedly be used to break the law every chance it gets, whether through illegal substance or tax avoidance, but if the goal of the whole program is to circumvent excessive government regulation and to essentially send a message, naming it something a little more neutral and a little less like something reminiscent of a shady alleyway where you can purchase black market body parts might go a long ways in the difference between public fear of it versus public curiosity and ultimately acceptance.
That said, free market isn't really much better than dark market. I'm not sure what a suitable name would be.

QuadrigaCX And Vault of Satoshi are both excellent. I've had nothing but good experiences with both.
Quadriga edges out VOS in terms of withdrawal options for me though. Withdrawing money from QCX is free, I believe VOS charges fees.

Then you buy shares in a company like peta-mine if you want dividends from mining and just hope for the best ;) Assuming the shares don't get so expensive that they aren't worth it of course.
Or maybe the whole network collapses on its self and we all go broke. That would be fun too.

What about the chips on the other side? If you look at the way the S1's are designed, the fan is designed to not only cool the heatsinks in the middle, but also blow a stream of cool air on the chips on the back. Seems like you'd lose that with this method.
I had played with the idea of adding some plexiglas strips on the sides and tops to contain the moving air like a pc case and maximize the efficiency of the 2 fans you can put on there to begin with, but i've not tried it yet to see if it'll actually improve anything.
They do put out a good amount of heat. I've got 4 of them running in my basement and the area where they are gets pretty toasty!

That's probably pretty close to the truth actually. It's the only remotely logical reason I can think of for the price having remained as high as it has for so long.

Kingston makes a Datatraveler Lock+ (I think that's what it's called). It's a hardware encrypted USB key, you can't read the contents of the drive until it's unlocked, and i'm fairly certain it uses AES encryption. It's a nice little key, full aluminum body. well made. 
I use one of these for cold storage (though I also keep other encrypted backups elsewhere as well using truecrypt, of course). Something like that is probably what you want if you don't want the drive contents readable. Of course, you could just use a regular USB key with a generic named encrypted folder on the key using truecrypt, not like anyone would know whats inside of it without decrypting it anyhow.

Glad to see some vinyl stores popping up that take Bitcoin, only thing that would make me happier is stores that also sell old reel to reel tapes!

Luckily, I think efficiency is likely about to peak with ASIC's so you won't see the insane arms race thats been happening for too much longer now that they've caught up to the 28nm process. 
Any efficiency gains going in to the future will be a lot smaller and likely in the same range as what we see with videocards rather than the huge jumps we're getting right now. 
I suspect that also means difficulty jumps in mining will also be less intense in the near future due to moores law, as the only way to increase output at this point will be to pile on more hardware rather than get better/more efficient hardware.

That's what I do! I like vinyl and often purchase a bands vinyl release to add to my collection and to support the bands I love, and then also download the FLAC rip online if the purchase doesn't come with one so I can listen to it on my other digital systems.

Not sure what the volume has to do with anything if you're just looking to buy BTC every month (*Edit Unless you mean to buy large ammounts.. then yes.. volume matters). Any exchange would do in that case as long as the current rate isn't too far out of norm with the market average. VOS has more than enough volume to be within average basically 99% of the time. Volume is really only relevant if day trading is your thing. They're also probably one of the most on the level and transparent exchanges on the market at the moment. VOS is excellent.
You can also use QuadrigaCX which has been great for me, and they also take Interac Money Transfer which makes buying really easy.

It's just an additional layer. I still use true crypt as well. I don't expect a $25 USB stick to offer all the protection in the world, but OP was asking for a USB hardware solution. When it comes to security and backup, redundancy is always the best approach, i'd never put all my faith in just one means of protection or backup!

I think what he's getting at is that credit cards and debit cards (to a lesser extent) cost merchants money to accept, but the merchants most definitely aren't sucking up that loss, they are building it in to their prices instead, so you ARE paying for it. 
As an incentive to customers using bitcoin they may offer discounts if you choose to pay with it. This already happens at some places here in Canada. For example, if you were to purchase computer parts at the Canada Computers chain, they offer discounts if you choose to pay cash/debit instead of credit, as it costs them less. The same will likely happen with bitcoin.

Id tend to agree to an extent, because having something you poured money and time into taken without compensation is awful.. however, if there was actually a legal avenue to get these movies I can assure you most people would likely take it. I'm glad that companies like HBO are perhaps finally waking up to this realization.
I would gladly pay money if I could watch new release movie in my home at my convenience. Such a service does not exist so piracy is the only way short of paying exorbitant fees at the theaters.
Like Gabe Newell has said many times before, piracy isn't a theft issue, it's a service issue. If pirates offer a fundamentally better service than the legitimate route, then you can't be surprised when people take it, regardless of your moral stance on the issue.
Services like Netflix and Steam have taken such prominent market positions because they understand this.

It goes to $100, 000 a coin. I get disgustingly rich. I buy a yacht and mansion. I launch a campaign to turn snorting cocaine off of hookers asses into a national sport. I live free, party hard, blow through all my money and then end up homeless and jobless on the street, destitute and alcoholic, and tell all my homeless buddies about how great my life used to be, and how, but for one fleeting moment, I was THAT guy, on top of the world. Unstoppable.
Needless to say, I am VERY excited for Bitcoins future.

Bitmain. They've been consistently delivering for a while now, even on new products such as their 1th miners, and their pricing is reasonable.
It's amazing that any other companies even stay in business with those guys in the space.
@_date: 2014-09-02 05:24:58
Yup, I made my money back on my 4 Antminers and then some. Just finished selling off the ones I had and put my self into a nice net positive.
Mining CAN be profitable if you get in at the right time and at the right price.
