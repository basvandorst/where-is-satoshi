Why would you transfer money with BTC? Use another crypto... damn man its like you wanted to throw away money. 
BTC is our alt coin store of value, with the current fees, its not supposed to be used for payments or withdrawals. 
Go into a grocery store and see if they accept gold, they dont.... same with bitcoin, it is our store of value.

Euro/usd might be screwed up, or they have a glitch. Bittrex is pretty cheap for btc right now

This brings up a good point, i wonder how many people have died with a small fortune of bitcoin with no access for the next of kin. 
Oh well, the less BTC in active circulation the better am i right?

Would wait 4 days on slr to improve considered a panic sell? I figured i would take my 18% loss and use the capital some where else, i can make 18% in 2 days.

Hey, all I’m saying, if he is driving a Tesla, he can probably afford some dress shoes with those khakis. 
I mean, who wants to look like Zach Galifianakis from hangover 1.
Please don’t tell me you tuck your cat themed shirt into your pants.

Where did you learn to dress, grandpa?

Bro, i missed out on making half a million dollars 10 months ago, i had bad dreams about it for two days and got over it. Everything will be ok, we all make mistakes and miss potential money, just learn from the mistakes. 
Edit: if i did make that half million USD, i took solace in knowing I probably would have spent it on girls and bottle service at clubs. Also known as hookers and blow. But i dont use hookers and i dont use drugs. But bottle service/ fine women and alcohol are my vice

Who wears running shoes with khakis? Someones gotta teach this guy how to dress.   Id rather drive a Honda then dress like that.
