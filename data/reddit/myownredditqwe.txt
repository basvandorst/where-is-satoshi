The guy was replying to the money laundering issue. He doesn't give a f*** about illicit activities as long as you pay taxes. That is where his salary and power comes from.

Some of your comments here tell me you do not know enough about crypto. Use those 200 to learn as much as you can,, you will probably lose them, but that will help you invest more safely in the future.
@_date: 2019-07-09 01:21:46
oh so you are one of those that gives free opinions without knowing the subject, cool.
@_date: 2019-07-25 08:30:04
How about we play there is &gt; 0% chance he is?
@_date: 2019-07-25 08:46:40
I share the same view as you on his personality. But this is not about if he is or not but making an excercise of what if he is.
@_date: 2019-07-25 08:58:26
According to him, and this is what he said during a trial a month ago, he will receive the keys sometime in 2020. I am trying to avoid discussing if he is or not because is a lost cause. If he is satoshi or not doesnt matter, lets block Satoshis associated addresses now. If Satoshi is around, he will move them now to prevent the block ( we can openly say we will do this and the deadline). If he does not move them, it means he is death, lost his keys, doesnt care or Craig is satoshi. Nothing is lost
edit: would appreciate if you keep your mind open and realise the risks and get some more influencing people to think about this and read all details about the June trial about Wright vs Kleimann last month, thanks.

I think you do not know enough about him. He is a total asshole. He will sell immediately all forks of btc and crash them forever. Just moving the coins to another address will crash btc. Then he will threaten to sell at any point , holding btc hostage. He will think of the worst evil he can. The uncertainty will delay adoption by years. And worst ...
@_date: 2019-07-09 01:13:21
Tbh, your questions shows a lack of understanding of basic maths, and I can imagine you are doing all the rookie mistakes with crypto, very hard to answer you when there is so much more you need to learn.
@_date: 2019-07-04 01:43:50
With the fees, the taxes on the gains... he will get less than 15 dollars. Hope he will learn a lesson next time. Buy, hold and keep buying.
@_date: 2019-07-25 09:25:18
I understand your point and you are 100% right, it would set a bad precedent. It will also set a bad precedent if he is Satoshi, he has 1 millon coins, he keeps the price hostage at will, and all the other bad things he could do with that power.
I am proposing a solution, just to start, does not mean it is what I ideally want. I want to reach to more influential people like Andreas, or whoever it is so they have a plan B.
@_date: 2019-07-31 06:44:34
BTC is more secure than BCH due to more miners been on BTC.
BCH decided to fork from BTC setting up a precedent that under any technical disagreement, people behind BCH will fork again.
BCH is at the moment cheaper for transactions, but that is going to change once lightning network is adopted and there will be no reason for BCH to exist anymore.
@_date: 2019-07-25 08:49:53
cool raise a post about it somewhere else
@_date: 2019-07-25 08:38:04
can you please read my post again? Can we not make a discussion of if he is or not? Can we discuss what if he is, how bad that would be and what can we do about it?
@_date: 2019-11-05 10:57:42
I work for banks and I can tell you that you are completely wrong. Banks do the same economic equation as any other business: cost + %earning = price. Banks do sell some good and bad products, some ignorant people still buy the last ones because they are unable to google a bit before buying. I'm in pro of regulation that weeds out this bad products.
The governments in most parts of the world spends more than they have to satisfy the demands coming both from socialist that want more money so they can distribute to poor people (under their argument and they of course keep a part as they are the middleman) and pseudo capitalist, which usually are companies that benefit from government spending.
Under this situation the central banks are forced to print money, deny doing so and you will be fired and replaced.
The banks are slaves of the politicians. The politicians make rules without understanding how banks work and create unpredictable situations and complicate the rules in a way that is next to impossible to track. In general, banks do not willingly do illegal things. If an issue is found they usually report them selfs to authority.
@_date: 2019-11-16 10:04:48
Serious question. If they raised tax to the big companies, to give that money to the people... Wouldn't the companies increase the price to account for the new tax, making all more expensive for everyone?
@_date: 2019-08-09 04:46:51
He has explained it many times, and the details are on the written records of the trial he is facing and can be found online.
@_date: 2019-08-22 08:51:43
The Bitcoin community is blind about this subject. It is probable that indeed Craig Wright is Satoshi. If you have followed his interviews and conferences, you know that he is full of hate. Once he recovers the keys in 2020, he will use those coins to destroy the Bitcoin price and sabotage the whole crypto space in the most perverse ways. It does not matter which coin you like, if Bitcoin goes down, all other coins will follow. This will delay adoption for years and maybe destroy the space completely. Save your Satoshi is not Craig comment deep in your rear, go read the lawsuit Ira Kleiman vs Craig Wright, you are absolutely dumb to think there is no chance he is, and you dont need to be 100% sure he is, just a small chance justify preventing the disease.
Burn Satoshi's coins.

This looks like a url that will install a rootkit in your machine. Beware if you visited it
@_date: 2019-10-13 12:55:20
I would like to explain thou, what is the root cause of this situation. There is a big expectation from unions, companies, NGOs, future home owners, etc (basically almost everyone), for government to intevene to fix different kind of problems. The issue is, that there is a limited amount of money and no politicians wants to be seen as an incompetent do nothing. Fairly enough because most would not vote for him if he did nothing.
The way that governments earn money is via taxes, debt or money printing. There is no other way. So when you or anyone demands the government to action, they must resort to this kind of bullshit that can only end up terribly bad, but in the short term, gives the loudest voices what they want.
And this is in part and simplified, why libertarians propose less government intervention. Every time the government does something, it is not free, it is taken by force from somewhere else, most of the time to benefit the loudest or more powerful voices, so if you are a normal person, prepare to get rektd.
@_date: 2019-08-08 22:56:17
History has plenty of guys like Bernie in power. They all resort in more taxes, money printing and debts to fund all the social programs they promised, eventually sending the economy to crisis.

Many banks are also using AWS, this is not a concern from a security point of view. There are technical and logistical reasons why you dont get more security by running your machines in house.

That I speak bad of Bernie does not mean I support Trump.
@_date: 2019-08-11 14:27:23
You are so wrong. It is always the same story... Socialist politician promising all kinds of social benefits. Once in power he resorts to debt, tax or money printing to provide those benefits. Economy collapses eventually. Of course one of the reasons is they did not diversify, how could they if all the resources were going to pay bribes, free money for all, etc.
@_date: 2019-08-11 14:29:53
Bitcoin has nothing socialist to it! It is all about anarcho capitalism!
@_date: 2019-10-04 10:13:05
We can not be sure he is or not. IMHO there is a high chance he is. He has the credentials (many phds and masters), credit card statements he paid for Bitcoin domain and mail addresses associated with Satoshi, deep technical knowledge of Bitcoin, confirmed to be by many well known people ,etc (do your own research). Just wait till next year when he is supposed to get the keys back and screw us all by selling his bitcoins and you will know (read the whole transcription of the Kleiman vs Wright trial for the details, and dont believe any article summarising it for you ,they are biased)

Altcoins follow Bitcoin price, take a look for example, at the chart for the past 3 days of Eth and Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-21 05:31:51
no longer rising? wtf are you talking about? have you seen the price of other coins relative to Bitcoin? You are just here to spread misinformation. I bet you are heavily invested in shitcoins and have lost so much money that are praying for Bitcoin to go down to feel better.

Hi fellow hodler
@_date: 2019-06-24 13:38:55
For me Bitcoin is a store of value. I wouldn't spend my Bitcoins when I know the price goes up. The fiat you have, devalues 3% or more each year depending on your country. Having your savings in cash is terribly dumb. Look at the price of Google ,Amazon, they also fluctuates a lot, specially during early days. Do you think it was dumb to buy them?
@_date: 2019-10-05 06:29:03
Craig Wright getting Satoshi's private keys at the beggining of 2020 (or that is what he says). Contrary to what downvoters may thing, I really hope he is lying.
@_date: 2019-06-01 02:12:41
maybe you are the one that can't tell that all parts are trolling
@_date: 2019-09-20 12:18:09
What if Satoshi is Craig Wright, and he has his coins in a trust so he didnt have to give half to his ex wife. And in 2020 he gets his private keys back and destroys Bitcoin price? What would that say of the whole community that has been ignoring this issue?
@_date: 2019-09-21 14:39:31
There are so many wrong thing in your message i dont know where to start. First of all let me tell you i love bitcoin and in no way I am a fan of  CW. Second, it does not matter what you believe, the chances of this are not cero, you might think the chances are 0.0001% and we might agree, that justifies you having a plan on what to do if that happens instead of just been a fool and not cover for all fail scenarios. Third, he cant sign the genesis block because his keys are in the trust, are you even reading?. If indeed he has his keys in the trust, he has no way to prove it in the way you want. But there are other ways to prove it, like he showed credit card statements where he paid the bitcoin domain and mail address used by Satoshi. He also crearly has in deep knowledge of bitcoin. This of course does not fully prove it but gives a significant chamce he actually is and thus, instead of been a fool and not do anything, preempt the damage he can do to the crypto scene.

I suggest you research better how all this works before doing any investment, your comments show you have no idea about crypto or any other type of investment. There are many factors involved in pricing the cryptocurrencies including number of units, popularity, use cases, purpose, etc.

@_date: 2019-05-20 09:56:45
I understand why you are asking this. Calculate the average price increase every month/year, and just sell some bitcoin every month/year to get your interest. This is exactly as the dividends in stocks.
@_date: 2019-05-14 09:12:28
Same here, has been like this for a few days
@_date: 2019-05-13 20:46:27
indeed, buying stuff with bitcoin is crazy. Who would spend something that increases in value over time like this? The only way bitcoin will get to be used for goods if they are sold at a special discount if you buy with bitcoin.
