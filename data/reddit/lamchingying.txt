Funnily enough, neither of those pages show the fee taken when using the Buy/Sell page. It's the first page you land on after signing in - many new buyers will start there. Punishing newbies for not knowing better seems like a classy move.

Fullest dock I've ever seen.

Yeah, I bought a little yesterday - thinking it wasn't a good time or price really, but looking at the long term :)
@_date: 2017-08-21 10:05:36
Exodus.

I'm going to repost this in 5 years time.
Wonder what our reactions will be?

Nice work.
Looks like I'd better get investing, I'm going to need more than my 0.05 BTC.

You should check out the Dead Sea Scrolls. They have more spaces than characters.

IIRC it took half a day when I did it some months ago.
They're experiencing a lot of traffic right now.

I've used  in the UK - you can pay with Bank Transfer (so no SEPA fee)

I had to search for Kat Dennings.
I was not disappointed.
@_date: 2017-08-29 21:41:00
Success? Yeah for them - hidden fees, very nice.
I won't be returning.

My bank charges £9 for a SEPA transfer.

Thought some might enjoy this:

I do some of this, could always do more.
Great info, and yes too much for the average user; nevertheless well done for putting it out there.

Looks like... $10k in 18 months?
@_date: 2017-08-15 07:54:58
Yeah, lots of us missed the boat.
Bitcoin made the news here in the UK in 2013 when some guy was trying to retrieve his discarded hard drive from a rubbish dump - it held the key to 7500 BTC. 
I should have paid more attention then! 
@_date: 2017-08-29 21:38:48
Got hit by an unexpected 7% fee while buying Bitcoin.
Won't be using them again.

haha, good one
@_date: 2017-09-05 06:41:30
That was a good 3 months - until the weekend we just had.
@_date: 2017-09-24 09:37:26
No, you'd just need a spare $50K you were willing to gamble.

You're concerned that your private key is very short.
AFAIK they are always a 51 character string starting with 5.

No spoilers now.
