It does not claim to do that. Even the whitepaper states, that a blocksize increase will be necessary.


No, we don't. But there is no solution to the problem, that conserves the level of security we have today.


Why? Let's assume someone invents a way to truncate the blockchain safely. Why would the hardware requirement (relative to relative technological level) rise? 
And why do we need new incentives?


Why do you think, that mining will be unprofitable? The algorithm makes sure, that mining difficulty moves with the supply. So there would be risks to the security, if that were to happen, but not to mining.

My point was that it is not paranoid to think that banks could do this at one point in the future. Definitely not soon, but it is a move they have in their playbook.

Well, there was this: 
Does not say that gold was disallowed to retrieve from the boxes, but it is not too far fetched that it might happen in the future.

They orphan the healthy blocks and build empty ones instead. Your node would accept the healthy one at first, but would abandon it as well once the empty blocks have reached a greater height. Once the empty blocks are the longest chain, even the 20% Core-miners would start building on this chain. is that correct?
As long has B2x has more hashrate, they could do this.

The result would be just empty blocks as long as there is more malicious hashpower than healthy as every non-empty block would be orphaned.

No, it would not. It's basically a 51% attack on the old chain. As long as B2x would have 51+% hashpower, they would make sure that the bitcoin-chain gets empty blocks and the B2x chain would operate with reduced hashrate. Your Core node couldn't do anything against that, because empty blocks are valid on the old chain.
They won't get this proposal implemented in time for the fork, but malicious miners could still point their ASICboost-hardware at the old chain and mine empty blocks there. The only defense against that is to wait it out until the miners run out of money.
