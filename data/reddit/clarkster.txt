Eh, why not?

Uh... because it does have a display and buttons...
@_date: 2017-12-03 03:31:39
Wow, you're right, I came here for that exact reference and no one else has mentioned it!

"Guys?  It's over.  I just realized my 80 year old neighbour does not have any bitcoin.  We don't have 100% of the world using it.  Just pack up and go home now, it was good while it lasted."
@_date: 2014-03-07 04:00:55
BitcoinBillionaire was giving $100+ equivalent for a while.  Not just because Bitcoins were cheap, he gave enough to equal $100 USD.
@_date: 2014-08-04 03:58:01
Did you just woosh a bot? :D
@_date: 2017-01-15 21:47:29
Ah, I was looking at it from the wrong angle.
@_date: 2017-01-15 05:17:29


But over 76% of all possible bitcoins have already been generated, and it will take over 100 more years to create the rest.
@_date: 2017-04-25 05:30:35
He says that because we are talking about the book '1984' here...

Probably November 2013. Might have bought at the top of the first $1k run.

Here is a real world insurance company, right now using the public Ethereum blockchain, for normal users who don't even need to own crypto.
AXA has built a flight delay insurance product.  A person can submit their info into the app and pay through fiat.  Behind the scenes an Ethereum contract accepts the info and waits on oracles to feed it data on flight delays.  If a flight is delayed or cancelled, the contract automatically executes and pays out to the user.
This is all done without the need for back-end servers, or employees to confirm and settle the payout.  All they need currently is a payment gateway to transfer fiat for their customers. This is extremely cheap and secure for AXA, saving them lots of money and manpower.
But judging by your wording, I'm not sure you really wanted serious replies. 
@_date: 2016-10-24 01:39:59
Ok, not sure who to believe then.  The other response I got said that Electrum will make the best guess it can, but it can't fully predict the future.
My understanding was that maybe the fee was correct at the time, but then if we have some slow blocks the waiting transactions may get larger and then the fee I had paid might be less than what people pay once they see a larger backlog.
Like if there is extremely bad luck, I could pay a good fee at +5 minutes, but it takes +30 minutes for the next block.  Anyone sending at +25 minutes may choose a larger fee than me.
Does that make sense?
@_date: 2016-10-23 20:28:34
Yeah, true, you can guess, but never 100%.  It just confirmed though, 2.5 hours, but better than nothing. :)
@_date: 2016-10-24 03:01:53
Exactly my point, and thus that question/example.
@_date: 2016-10-23 20:27:48
I'll check it out thanks.  I just had mine confirmed, 2.5 hours later, but better than nothing.
@_date: 2016-10-23 20:00:50
Okay, I had thought Electrum would've picked a good fee.  I had read it is dynamic now, right?  Is this a case of people who know what they are doing, and paying attention, just picking something slightly higher?
@_date: 2016-05-23 21:13:55


He does?
@_date: 2016-05-22 01:51:01
Nope, you can already pay by chip. I just tap my credit card to terminals all the time. Bitcoin does not fulfill your wish for the end times.
@_date: 2015-02-20 18:54:57
Some sort of Magic The Gathering Online eXchange.  MtGox?
@_date: 2017-07-09 01:38:02
Actually it did, the 6 or so months after the DAO was a very depressing time for the ethereum price. But in the end it works out if the underlying technology is good. Bitcoin might have a low price for a while until investor confidence comes back, but nothing has killed it yet, it's going to be here for a long time.
@_date: 2016-07-08 17:37:19
That could even be automated then, and Google likes automation.  When someone places an ad, check if it's on their phishing site list.  Because, well, Google obviously knows about it if it warns Chrome users.
Then as long as the ad campaign is running, check each day to see if the site has been added to the list, so they can't start the campaign and then change the site.
@_date: 2017-06-09 14:35:08
It's not illegal, just sell it on QuadrigaCX, they're based in Canada.
@_date: 2013-04-26 20:03:42
Then use Electrum, no need to download the blockchain to use a local client. And since it uses deterministic wallets your paper backup is always up to date. 
@_date: 2013-04-14 02:24:12
Any updates on what has happened with your account?  Did you get a hold of customer support?
@_date: 2013-04-16 01:45:15
No need to be sarcastic, the word blockchain has a very specific meaning and does not refer to blockchain.info He was wondering which you meant. If you checked the blockchain on any of the various different sites to confirm your transaction, or if you checked your own wallet. 
@_date: 2013-04-24 20:31:51
Someone is showing his ignorance of art and lashing out in anger instead. ;-)

@_date: 2013-04-19 01:59:45
Go into bitcoin-qt and send the money to your Blockchain.info wallet.
@_date: 2013-04-20 15:33:03
With that card you could probably get 1 BTC in a little less than a year, but the difficulty is rising quickly now that ASIC miners are starting to show up.  So it might be like 1.5 or 2 years to get 1 BTC.
You won't get rich unfortunately, not even with a high end ATI card.  GPU mining is very close to the end of it's run.
@_date: 2013-05-10 03:38:32
Yeah, unfortunately you have to play by Apple's rules.  And Apple doesn't want you to use bitcoins on their phones. :(
Though it is Gyft's fault that they only have smartphone apps.  If they wanted to add bitcoin purchases though it would not get approved, furthermore their app might possibly get banned, with weeks or months of back and forth with Apple begging to be put back on, even after they remove the bitcoin functionality.
@_date: 2013-05-28 05:00:23
Wow, that's one of the largest wooshes I've seen. To think you are so angry at him for missing the joke! Haha, take a look at yourself! That was awesome. 
@_date: 2013-04-20 15:25:24
There is always that chance, no matter how you generate the wallet.   But if you had the computing power to do it, you could mine all the remaining bitcoin blocks first.  Then you would be a fraction of a fraction of a percent on the way to finding a collision.
@_date: 2013-04-14 02:16:22
No one knows who 'he' is or who 'they' are.  Some suspect a group of cryptography researchers, but there is not much proof.
@_date: 2013-04-21 14:59:54
Well, something happened.  You might not know exactly what.  But since you did not remove it, the absolute very first thing you should do, before anything else, is get those coins OUT of that wallet and into a different one.  Immediately.
If your paper wallet is from blockchain.info and you didn't remove your private keys from the website, it won't protect you. (Just in case you're one of the ones that don't quite understand, you probably do, but it has to be said)
If someone else was on your account, it is now completely compromised, I'm surprised your coins aren't already gone.
If it was a software mistake and no one broke into your account, moving them somewhere else won't hurt anything.
I just wouldn't trust that account any more, I'd possibly change email passwords, never use the same password for a wallet again, etc.
You can never be too careful. :)
@_date: 2013-05-23 15:52:02
They are talking about an average user not having to download the blockchain.
@_date: 2013-05-23 22:14:46
I'm not sure about that but I'm sure it's been talked about on the thread on bitcointalk.  You could check it out.
@_date: 2013-05-01 23:57:23
Like a printer? 
@_date: 2013-05-15 04:16:12
The current size is 128bit, more than enough to make sure that your wallet will not be hacked within your lifetime, and possibly your grandchildren's lifetimes. Armory is currently 256bit but they are considering lowering it to 128bit. 
@_date: 2013-04-15 17:26:23
Great, thanks for the reply.  I was a little worried about them but it seems like they are quite professional about everything.
@_date: 2013-04-19 02:03:29
No, eventually you will run out of change addresses in that backup you made.  So if you send a lot of money from that wallet, eventually the backup will be out of date.  So make a backup every 50 transfers or so just to be safe.
Or create a wallet in Electrum or Armory, it is a deterministic wallet and the backup will always be good, no matter what you do with it.
@_date: 2013-04-25 01:53:05
I think the idea would be that it is always there as long as Bitcoin exists.  Backed up on the blockchain across countless computers.
Maybe encrypt a deterministic wallet seed, then it's a permanent backup on the blockchain that is never out of date?
@_date: 2013-05-03 00:40:05
Looks perfectly normal for a market with a low volume, yes, even MtGox is low volume comparatively. 
@_date: 2013-04-25 15:11:22
That's true.  Technically it will be there as long as you want your Bitcoins, but you need to know where it is and your decryption key any way. :)
@_date: 2013-05-08 20:11:20
You can't flood the market, bitcoins are always created at the same rate, well, every two weeks the difficulty changes to make sure a block is only found every 10 minutes on average. ASICMINER won't be creating any extra coins, they will just be getting a larger share of the daily coins if they outpace the efforts of other miners. 
@_date: 2013-06-24 14:01:55
Just call them before complaining that it won't work. I called them a few months ago, no answer, 1 minute later they called back and apologized and helped me my issue.
@_date: 2013-04-21 15:38:23
Ok, good.  Sounds like you're nice and protective of your coins already. :)
Personally, even if I found out exactly what happened I would not feel right trusting that Blockchain.info account again.  The great thing about Bitcoin is you can have a new Wallet in seconds. I love it. :)
@_date: 2013-05-02 01:48:17
It's actually layman's terms. 
@_date: 2013-04-21 23:17:16
Dude, Android comes with a Linux shell built in.  From there you just install all the normal Linux command line tools you want.  Bang, boom, done.  You don't even have to jailbreak. :D
I mean, come on.  I don't even use the normal method to transfer files, I rsync between my phone and my PC.
If you're going to attack another OS, at least spend more than 5 minutes reading about it first. :P
@_date: 2013-04-21 17:19:54
That's the thing though.  Anonymous loves Bitcoin, Anonymous also hates Bitcoin.  Anonymous loves fighting to make your life better and Anonymous wants you to lose so much money in Bitcoin you become homeless. Anonymous wants to make a better world for everyone and Anonymous wants to watch the world burn.
That's the problem with trying to talk about Anonymous as a single group.

Cloudflare held up to the largest DDOS attack seen yet, just [last month](  Their entire business model is selling the best in industry DDOS protection.  
They're not a hosting provider, they are a CDN, security and DDOS protection provider.

There is a cafe in Victoria, BC that accepts Bitcoin. I don't remember the name, but you should be able to find it by searching, there were a couple news articles about it. They also accept Canadian Tire money. :-)

You should have set the order for $75. You're lucky people wanted to buy it for a much higher price, just under $75.

I don't think signups are completely open, the only thing I can do at ripple.com is enter my email to be notified when I can sign up.  I'd love to try it though.
@_date: 2013-04-17 04:29:04
Can you explain why? And more importantly, is there any possible way the crazy investors will follow this? ;) 
@_date: 2013-04-25 15:12:19
Oh nice, they just want people to trickle in it seems.  Thanks for the link.
@_date: 2013-04-22 20:36:13
But switching to Bitcoin doesn't mean you don't have to pay taxes.  Income is income.  Switching to Bitcoin actually makes it easier for the government to track all your income.  Every transaction is publicly recorded.  They will just need to look at all your receiving addresses and then ask you to pay the tax on each transaction.
@_date: 2013-05-23 16:01:25
There are a few wallets out there already like this.  Most being online wallets, which I personally don't want to trust.  But you can use the Electrum wallet on your own computer, your wallet keys are completely local and secure, you just connect to a remote server to read the blockchain.
@_date: 2013-04-24 16:18:51
From the people that sold them to MtGox or Coinbase.

Ah yes, that's it.  Thanks.

Replying to an ancient comment of yours about Canada, but is it still true Gyft is coming to Canada before Xmas?

If you're setting up an exchange, why haven't you hired a full-time lawyer yet?  And wouldn't you already have a lot of experience in the financial sector yourself if you were thinking about setting up an exchange?
