Hi Jeremiah
@_date: 2014-06-29 14:10:47
This is not a victory. Us celebrating this means they can think the legality of bitcoin is up for discussion.
@_date: 2014-07-27 01:43:11
Moving to Switzerland if this ever becomes real
@_date: 2014-03-15 15:37:41
What's the deal with this link? 300$ Coins?
@_date: 2014-05-05 15:47:41
Fuck them
@_date: 2014-10-19 02:12:19
More like Silk Road. OpenBazaar is decentralized.

I'm in Boston I'd be up frit
@_date: 2014-06-19 10:41:06
Check your privilege, bitcoin. I need bitcoin ism because I'm sick and tired of the fiatarchy!
@_date: 2014-12-15 00:10:38
yeah but not for very long ;)
@_date: 2014-03-11 22:29:19
necropost but when will we be able to put cex.io GH/S towards other pools??
@_date: 2015-05-03 03:49:39
First tip, thank you :D
@_date: 2014-11-12 17:54:28
I had a lot of coins on my old Dell inspiron laptop. Rest in pieces
@_date: 2015-01-25 18:10:06
It might, yeah. A lot of people might just gloss over it and be like "wtf is this"
@_date: 2015-01-25 18:06:35
Seems like a great way to distribute coins to people who will never use them
@_date: 2015-01-15 02:32:30
So this is good news then, maybe the crash will kill Cex. 
@_date: 2015-01-05 04:11:59
*Anarchism is some dumb commie shit
@_date: 2014-03-26 16:35:40
Yeah I saw that and I had been wondering what happened to it
@_date: 2014-06-14 23:45:50
I got it whenever ago, who cares. Can I move it to another pool or sell it or something?
@_date: 2015-05-02 03:41:29
I have AP tests next week, can I get a little love?
@_date: 2015-05-13 20:19:54
That guy stole my joke! I commented a very similar thing on a YAFL Facebook post a whole ago
@_date: 2016-11-08 05:50:26
Thank you my good man 1KrcUGVAwHHcVPYgPswGKb9UQmNof5rqsN

You can't defend proof of work in 2019
@_date: 2015-03-17 00:27:39
Because I am broke
@_date: 2015-02-04 23:44:02
That could be considered violent
@_date: 2015-02-04 23:08:01
Poly-centric law
@_date: 2015-02-05 23:58:01
Well, no. The problem now is rich people paying the government to enact their will on others. Poly centric law is people paying for the protection they want, they can't enact their will on others
@_date: 2015-02-05 14:33:45
The majority should not have the right to override the rights of the minority like in democracy. This is why poly-centric law (panarchy) is a better idea: people can buy and sell the rights-protection services of governments in an open market, making decisions that affect themselves rather than others.
@_date: 2015-02-05 00:50:52
Yes. If I offer you drugs, am I being violent? No. If I offer you drugs and you accept, knowing the risk of taking the drugs, am I being violent? Still no. It's not violence until I coerce you into buying the drugs.
@_date: 2015-02-01 15:57:44
What pebble face is that?
@_date: 2015-02-10 01:57:26
Is there a safe way to sell bitcoins on ebay? It seems like a sweet gig with big profit margins
