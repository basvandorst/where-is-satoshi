Those lower highs tho
@_date: 2018-09-17 16:16:00
Wow 
@_date: 2018-09-03 01:55:50
Yay for no volume ��
@_date: 2018-09-03 02:59:22
Bankers and brokers can be trusted
@_date: 2018-09-14 02:05:14
I actually lol’d.
@_date: 2018-09-12 01:54:49
With chaos on the street who’s gonna foot the bill let alone supply your house internet so you can apply those bittybois
@_date: 2018-09-12 02:33:13
That don’t answer who works at national grid to keep the power on for electricity and internet to access my precious.
@_date: 2018-09-19 15:31:56
What crypto?
@_date: 2018-09-03 16:34:03
So really all of our digital currency is dependent on our electricity which can be regulated by governments?
@_date: 2018-09-14 09:54:26
Aaaand it’s gone.
@_date: 2018-09-13 01:28:27
Don’t. Buy on coinbase or gemini is my recommendation. Would rather pay extra for gtd security (and insurance too)
@_date: 2018-09-17 03:07:01
Interesting ��
@_date: 2018-09-14 02:25:51
That bubble is next. The real question is if the credit market will burst first.
@_date: 2018-09-13 01:26:43
Did you fomo this morning before going to school?
@_date: 2018-09-13 01:31:48
Just break 6k already let’s get this over with

Just asking the obvious questions I haven’t still haven’t found answers to sir
@_date: 2018-09-04 10:03:04
*laughs tremendously*
@_date: 2018-09-12 14:05:29
I still think people are missing the big picture - bittyboi is reliant on a middleman for its entire application
@_date: 2018-09-03 02:01:13
If by break out moment you mean low volume then you can lead the flock of sheep right into the slaughter house ��

Before the US gov concludes the investigation on Tether pumping fake money into BTC? lol
@_date: 2018-08-21 23:54:20
Back in July the ICO journal claimed their two cboe sources said there’s a 90% chance of a positive ETF decision. Nothing. Now they’re saying it’s highly unlikely these two ETFs will be approved Thursday.... inverse logic? 
@_date: 2018-08-23 01:11:27
If you believe everything MSM says.
@_date: 2018-08-24 09:53:26
Isn’t that ironic 
@_date: 2018-08-23 01:35:38
There’s legit no shame in that whatsoever. This market is the limewire aids of the 2000s
@_date: 2018-08-15 00:42:25
*evil Asian kid meme*  Use CEO title to say crypto is a scam then buy larger initial at a discount from FUD.

Glitch. Off topic
@_date: 2018-08-19 20:13:55
Thanks..  BTC being at lowest vol on CoinbasePro (4.3k) I’ve seen did stand out 
@_date: 2018-08-13 23:18:30
Alts getting destroyed face down in the pillow. BTC dominance 52%
@_date: 2018-08-23 01:48:43
I stand corrected. Thanks for the share
@_date: 2018-08-23 23:12:14
You’re right. Luckily I have Tether set above BTC, ETH, LTC, etc etc and every. Single. Time. a big move occurs with crypto (both positive/negative) Tether becomes abnormally more volatile. Check out the key dates for bitcoin and then match the time stamp on tether’s chart to see for yourself.
@_date: 2018-08-22 22:29:29
Funny Tether is most active during that giant leg down, it’s spike last night, it’s selloff shortly after, and literally right now after the SEC denied 7 ETFs. 
There can’t possibly be a connection ��
@_date: 2018-08-14 02:45:01
Investors with cboe think it will be
@_date: 2018-08-22 09:55:28
Thinking more along the lines of a short squeeze 
@_date: 2018-08-21 22:12:07
Shorts nearing all time highs on BitFinex. Smart money has these ETFs decisions delayed yet again. Hopefully the manipulation will subside unlike last time
@_date: 2018-08-23 22:33:35
Basically. There’s an interesting thread on twitter connecting Tether and BitFinex transactions to the exchange ($170M) and then buying BTC with it pumping its price (+800). It’s clear manipulation and fraud no matter how you want to cut it. It’s a disservice to the community the investigation is still ongoing while these tumors at noble bank aren’t removed.
@_date: 2018-08-24 03:00:43
This was the single handedly the greatest reply I’ve ever read on social media. Thank you, it was extremely informative and well explained.
@_date: 2018-08-23 23:33:38
I’d like to know why 21,000,000 coins
@_date: 2018-08-19 20:33:03
I definitely know it’s bots but what’s triggering them to cause oscillation like this? Severe low volume is my best guess as of now 
@_date: 2018-08-14 02:32:59
Did you not see the massive rise in shorts the past week? 
@_date: 2018-08-22 09:55:50
Short squeeze 
@_date: 2018-08-23 03:00:03
If I manipulated this market and saw that 9 ETFs were rejected in one shot I’d also rethink my strategy before moving forward.
@_date: 2018-08-14 09:49:04
What do you mean? It was proven excessive amount was generated for buy orders for BTC back in November which caused it to skyrocket at the 20k level
@_date: 2018-08-22 23:28:30
Missed out on some fun RSI levels
@_date: 2018-08-13 23:20:15
You silly goose egg. We’re still in a down trend and setting lower highs
@_date: 2018-08-22 09:57:51
I’m having trouble thinking the SEC will approve anything that’s being investigated on whether Tether/ Noble Bank pumped worthless coins into BTC to build 2017s bullrun. I mean there still isn’t an audit ��
@_date: 2018-08-31 00:28:59
How can bears run out of steam when it’s the bulls that need to prove holding higher lows...
@_date: 2018-08-14 03:08:20
So tether has nothing to do with it 
@_date: 2018-08-14 02:25:06
Christmas morning for some of us

I *think* it’s the best high level indicator we have
@_date: 2018-11-19 02:00:03
$5510 each as of 11/18/18
@_date: 2018-03-09 03:21:36
6-6.5 
@_date: 2018-03-18 01:20:59
It’s supposed to test lower levels?
