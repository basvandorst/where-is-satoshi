Uh... I mean, in the sense that asset transactions, storage and records take place on the blockchain then yeah, but the world isn't going to stop using non-blockchain-based assets. Stocks didn't end up in the museum when people stopped using actual stock tickers; they just went digital. The same could very well happen with blockchain technology like it did with computers and the internet, I agree. If every company has its own personal token, which has value dependent on the value of the company and can be exchanged for some universal supercurrency, then that's effectively the same thing as stock.
But it's laughable to suggest that blockchain is going to somehow make capital and shares extinct, especially within the span of 10 years.

That's the nature of high-risk ventures. They're for people who want to get get *really* rich and are willing to tolerate uncertainty and potential disaster.
Everything else you listed is for people like me, who are okay with small, incremental gains and a modest lifestyle. Sure I might be richer if I dump my networth into magic internet money, but I won't be *safer*, and I certainly won't feel safer.
Especially when there's no truly foolproof way to store crypto yet. All these stories about lost/destroyed hardware wallets and hard drives make me shudder. I'll keep my money in an index fund, thanks. Slow and steady wins the race (a significantly higher percentage of the time)

Buffett also very much dislikes crypto. [He called Bitcoin a mirage](
