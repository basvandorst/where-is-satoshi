I don't get this sentiment. Waited until it was too late for what?
It doesn't matter if 10 guys had converted their savings to bitcoin, great for them, but what are they going to do with it? Bakers, plumbers, mechanics, grocers, aren't going to take it because they know very few, if any people who are going to take it from them. It's a chicken and egg problem.
You're basically saying too bad they didn't already develop a fully functional parallel bitcoin economy, when there were no incentives in place for doing so.

Just to take one of many many possible examples, mtgox, as an analogy to your invoking of the internet. Did people say the internet wouldn't be big because there was a massive unsolved crime(was it even a crime? wtf knows with gox) and consequently some unknown entity controlled 10-20% of all network routers?
What if something similar had been an issue in the early internet? And what if the internet was software instead of hardware and the aforementioned problem could be simply avoided by running a minorly tweaked version of the software that didn't have the stolen routers? What do you think people would do? If they even wanted to use the internet.

|*The price has to come down to a level where ppl like me can - without trouble - suck up all the newly mined BTC coming every month from the big miners. If I have to guess, this price is $250 or below.* 
It's not the absolute price than determines the attractiveness of an investment purchase. It's the expected percentage change in the purchase price after your purchase. If the price was at 1 cent, you could probably, as you say 'suck up' all the newly mined coins, but if two weeks later people are only willing to pay half a cent per bitcoin, well then shit, you've effectively lost half your money.
The same is true no matter the price $1 $.5, $100 $50, etc. you can divide a number and infinite amount of times.
|*I'm buying all the way down, because that is the only safe strategy I can come up with.* 
How in the world is that safe? Safe in the fact that if the price ever goes higher than it currently is, you will have bought for a lower price? Though probably unlikely, there's no guarantee that the price will ever be higher than it currently is, you're taking a non-negligible risk of losing money, I'm not sure 'safe' is the right word. Of course, virtually all investments come with risk, but to describe an investment that is riskier than many, as safe...
|*Bitcoin price is controlled by psychology*
If you want to talk about psychology, I think there are at least two things to consider. If something has an outlandish price even momentarily, that can hold an undue weight in people's reasoning about it's relative value, a kind of anchoring effect.
Second, just because an investment asset has fallen precipitously in price doesn't mean people are going to rush in to buy it. Investment managers don't generally go around scooping up stocks at 52wk lows. I imagine most people's thinking goes, if it's fallen this far, there is probably a reason why and who is to say it won't fall further, and unless I have convincing, not widely known knowledge that that price has fallen too far, I'm going to trust what the market has decided.
Of course, you also have people aware of the fact that markets are prone to exaggerated movements in both directions who will take a risk of buying something at a relatively low price even if they don't have strong evidence that the price 'should' be higher. People buying goxbux last spring for example.

But, not wanting to slow the remarkable year over year growth they've been having too much, and bankrupt themselves, they will seek to court a new audience. The new audience being holders of btc, composed primarily of young internet users accustomed to bypassing paywalls, blocking ads, and generally not paying for media by viewing it through unofficial channels.

What is impressive about that exactly? I saw that page the other day, and thought, well, that's kind of slimy, but surely no one falls for that.
Look at the title of the chart that is going up and to the right. It says "Cumulative chart," it never goes down, it is simply a graph of the total number of bitcoin tweets, each new tweet the graph goes higher.
The graph below it shows the tweets per day. While it looks like there has been a slight uptrend lately with the 'all' option selected, if you click the '1y' option there is a subtle but pretty clear downtrend.
Edit:  I assume the "Delta Chart" is meant to be tweets per day. And after clicking around on some of the other data, I think 'slimy'(as in intentionally misleading) was the wrong word because the 'cumulative chart' makes sense for some of the other data. That site just seems to be not very clear in its presentation, nor has much polish gone into it. For example all the charts are simply labeled with 'values.'

I don't know where you are getting the idea that
*At the very least my bitcoin holdings should retain their value.*
well, probably from this very subreddit, but this is far from certain.
If you are at all interested in having a reasonable expectation of maintaining a percentage of your current purchasing power I suggest taking that amount and converting it to gold coins and/or high denomination euro notes and putting them in a safe deposit box or boxes. Probably a good idea to look into the jurisdictional laws for wherever you do this.
It's an interesting idea to buy some bitcoins and not look at them for 2-4 years, if nothing else it will likely be a surprise when you do look, but you have to recognize it is a gamble. Bitcoin is probably more likely than gold to be worth 4x it's current value in 2-4 years, but it's also probably more likely than gold(which has held a relatively consistent value for millennia) to be worth 4x less than its current value.
Is it more likely for bitcoin to be worth more or less than it is now, in the future? Who knows!
But I wouldn't fool yourself into thinking that odds are significantly tilted in the greater direction, seeing as how it is not even clear that the recent bubble is done deflating.
So in summary, decide what portion of your money you are comfortable gambling with and buy bitcoin with that percentage. Before doing this it is probably worthwhile to read more about bitcoin, including from sources other than here.
With the remaining funds, cash or gold in a safe deposit box. Or, depending on the amount of time you have for this, there are various other non-banking system assets you could look into, though they would likely take a significant time investment to learn enough about them. Things like art, numismatics, bearer-share instruments, or maybe even something related to your past business you are already familiar with.

You're kind of on to something, but it is going too far to say that they would be of equivalent value.
If there was some future blacklist/whitelist scheme that a non-trivial amount of people abide by, then the blacklisted coins are obviously going to be worth less. Even though they are still essentially the same thing[*], they would be in no way superior and in all ways inferior to whitelisted coins because they would have reduced vectors of transmission, i.e. places to spend them.
Perhaps a separate economy would develop trading solely in blacklisted btc, but the price per coin would no doubt bifurcate as well.
  
  
[*] And perhaps they wouldn't essentially still be the same thing when you consider that money is basically an agreement among society that these easy to pass around tokens are equivalent in value to these other things in these particular ratios. If significant numbers of people decided that blacklisted coins were no longer equivalent in value to these other things, then while they would still be same thing in the source code sense, in the societal construct that is money, they wouldn't.
@_date: 2015-05-08 21:31:26


Do you understand there is basically zero chance of that occurring and thus zero need for the code to be able to handle thousands of transactions per second?
Bitcoin works pretty well for cash transactions on the internet because it was designed for that and it(and its derivative currencies) are the only game in town. However, of all the financial transactions on the internet, it is really just a small subset for which the characteristics of a cash transaction are desirable.
Another thing to consider, the vast majority of bitcoin is owned by a very small fraction of bitcoin holders. This alone should tell you that the prospect of any future scenario with thousands of transactions per second is laughable.
@_date: 2015-05-08 21:28:53

This is a common notion bandied about, but I think it is fallacious reasoning. Consider this, say you're at a party or something and there is a really attractive girl, you see her a beckon a guy into a bedroom with her. You think "lucky bastard," but then not a minute later you see the same guy running from the bedroom and out the house entirely, covering his mouth and nose and his skin is a different shade than when he went in. You think, "That's weird." Then you see the girl beckon another guy into the bedroom, same thing happens, then again, and again. Finally, after this going on for a while the house is entirely cleared out except for you sitting on the couch and the girl in the bedroom, then she beckons you, what do you do?
When the price of something, especially something that requires many people to regard it as valuable for it be valuable, drops ever lower people interpret that as a market signal that this thing may not be all it's cracked up to be. Even when it is priced at a price they would have jumped at a couple of months ago they will be reluctant to buy because they are taking into account the market movement that has led to this point and what that says about the broader market's opinion on a given thing.
Honestly, this post just reads like you're terrified of the price falling further and you're trying to shore things up.
There is probably a point at which it currently doesn't make sense for btc to fall below given the current btc economy and probable future scenarios, that point looks like it is probably lower than $3xx.


This is another fallacy, it doesn't matter what the nominal price of something is if it can still fall much further in percentage terms. Anything priced above 0 can always lose 99.9% of its value. Would you buy one million bitcoins at a dollar a piece if there was a strong potential of them falling in value 75%?

I'd imagine they're focused on that because it is a proven mechanism for how things come to have a value, it is a distributed system called, "the market."
The argument of the price doesn't matter is basically -- the price doesn't matter because it doesn't match what I think it should be priced at, disregard all the other market participants, they're wrong, if they had the same vested interest that I do they would think it should be priced higher too!


The price itself is of course not the metric to judge what the price should be, as I already mentioned, but conveniently, it is the result of a broad range of people looking at the metrics and prognostications that do matter for determining the thing's value and then the result of that is 'the price.'

This is a common refrain seen around as well. 
If few people use it as a currency now, and the majority of people that buy it simply sit on it hoping it will appreciate, why do people think lots of people will want to use it as a currency in the future?
If cryptocurrencies were to become significantly more user friendly in the future and there was an economic niche revealed where their use made sense for lots of people, wouldn't people be more likely to choose a cryptocurrency that didn't come with a built in rentier class of people who have piled up large amounts of the cryptocoin while praying that a vapor future demand be made manifest?


At present bitcoin's two main use cases seem to be buying recreational drugs*(which I have no problem with) and paying for things related to computer fraud(which I think is a destructive waste of time by misguided minds.) Both of these things are presumably things that regulators would like to regulate out of existence as best they could. So if they are even partially successful in doing that, what is going to drive the demand for bitcoin?(tell me something other than remittances, or if you insist on remittances then please explain why if it is not a suitable option for many now, how it could become one in the future.)
 *As a side note on this, bitcoin does seem to be very well suited to the online drug trade, it of course has already proven itself in this area, but from my outside perspective it seems current or potential future problem areas are the on and off ramps, the exchange between fiat and crypto. But imagine if the loop could be closed between the drug buyers and sellers.
So after a drug dealer has accumulated a large amount of crypto, he'll need to convert it to a more widely accepted currency to pay for the cultivation/production of more drugs, food, housing, etc. I guess the current method is to use a mixer then cash out at Bitstamp or btc-e or something, but say that bitcoin becomes regulated to the point that this becomes much more difficult to manage. So to close the loop, using bitcoin or another crypto, the drug dealer with the accumulated crypto sells to a network of crypto dealers, these crypto dealers then sell to a smaller hub in the network and on and on until the drug buyer instead of going over to the neighborhood weed dealer, goes over to the neighborhood crypto dealer, then buys his weed online with the crypto.
There would likely need to be some profit incentive in this, so maybe the drug dealer would sell their cryptocoin to large hubs in the crypto dealing network at a discount in exchange for not dealing with more onerous regulated off-ramps, that discount then gradually being reduced as the crypto radiated out through the network.
Of course with the way drug laws are being re-developed, hopefully all of this becomes moot in the not to distant future.

It's impossible for the vast majority of people to say anything conclusive about Willy, but why are so many people so eager to assert that 'Willy didn't affect the price that much'? Is it because they are holding out hope that they will be millionaires soon, through purely 'organic' market demand?
People's favorite claim for 'debunking' that Willy had much effect on the price, 'Willy didn't really buy that much', makes no sense. It doesn't matter how much Willy bot bought(ha), only that through consistent purchases with phantom fiat, it created an imbalance in the order book where demand more or less always exceeded supply.

In all seriousness, what are coinbase and others like them, as well as you fellow denizens of thinking, as bitcoin is pushed into this ever more tightly regulated space?
As long as bitcoin is around it is going to have "unauthorized" uses, that is it's reason for being essentially. People will no doubt found ways to circumvent regulation so long as they feel compelled to "unauthorized uses."
But as bitcoin becomes just as regulated or more so than people's current currency and accumulates the sort of hassle and inconvenience that comes with that excessive regulation, what in a sense becomes coinbase, et al's reason for being? What is there that is going to compel in people an interest in bitcoin?
It seems to me that coinbase and companies like them got into bitcoin and/or ramped up their operations after seeing the inexplicable 2013 price rise and banked on that continuing or something like it occurring again to bring them riches, but is hasn't. And ironically it seems the way they are taking the btc economy makes it more likely it won't happen.

Pimps derive income from taking a cut of the money that people pay to prostitutes. Prostitution can by simple observation as well as empirical methods be shown to cause psychological torment in many if not all cases. 
This seems a not too dissimilar dynamic from what is often seen in bitcoin land where all things come secondary to attempting to secure a profit from a rising btc price, no matter if those other things are a bitcoiner losing lots of money in a software/fat finger type mistake, massive bitcoin heists from hacks, the crumbling of a nations financial infrastructure, etc. etc.

Those are some good points, and as you allude to, they raise the question of what use does bitcoin actually have?
Some like to say 'store of wealth,' the problem with that though is bitcoin is reproducible code so there is no actual scarcity. The only scarcity it can be said to have is the bitcoin brand.  And if there was some group or economic system that decided they wanted to use a cryptocurrency for a store of wealth, my instincts tell me that they would prefer to go with a codebase in which people like the gox culprit, that guy that did the $1million dice heist the other day, etc. etc. didn't hold such a large percentage of the cryptocurrency. They would probably start with a codebase more suited to their purposes.
So where does that leave bitcoin? Well for now, I guess in the niche it has made for itself and done pretty well in of paying for things online that authorities would prefer not be paid for online.
Another possible area of development for bitcoin or another cryptocurrency is facilitating transfers of money through areas that traditional money systems prevent or make difficult, for ex. on one end converting currency X to bitcoin and on the other end converting bitcoin to currency Y. The hangup here is that a market with sufficient interest in bitcoin and doing these kind of transfers has to develop on both ends.

If bitcoins success is contingent upon people using something other than bitcoin, then how is bitcoin succeeding? And if the something other doesn't actually require bitcoin, then that is a very tenuous link, because sooner or later people would just say wait a minute why are we even bothering with this bitcoin stuff?
But this is all glossing over the fact that the thinking behind this is trying to get people to do things in a way that is different from their current ways but the new ways don't benefit them in any ways. It is just a ploy by the promoters of these new ways to inflate the value of their holdings.
Bitcoin works for some things, others not so much. I think those are the basic facts of the matter.

Not far at all, it's main purpose seems to be its use as a buzzword that is bandied about as a supposed solution whenever someone brings up a problem with bitcoin. I don't see it ever amounting to much more than that.
The reason I say this is because when I looked into it sometime back, it seems to require merchants to operate payment networks parallel to the blockchain but there is never any explanation of what incentive the merchants have for doing this. It doesn't help that the amount actual bitcoin commerce of the traditional sort, is so small that that the operation of these networks is sure to be a net loss for almost all merchants who would consider operating them. 
   
The neat thing about bitcoin is how the math and incentives align to at least create a functioning payment network, it's other problems notwithstanding.

You seem to think that the main driver of the price is the total amount of bitcoins that are sold, but that is not exactly true.
What ultimately drives the price is what people are willing to pay for a thing. So even if all the exchanges in the world have just a half a bitcoin on them and people are only willing to pay 50 cents for it, guess what the price of bitcoin is then.

If you have control over an order book and you aren't constrained by y'know actual money, there is essentially no limit to how high you can drive the price. You simply consistently clear all the sell orders that actual markets participants don't buy. Thus driving the price higher and higher when if it had been left to actual market dynamics, the price would have declined.
In practice the limit on this would be when people start withdrawing their money from your exchange faster than people are depositing money and you can no longer meet your obligations to the withdrawers.
It amazes me that people fail to understand this, perhaps it is done willfully.

Calling bitcoin a "superior payment mechanism" in this situation is rather ludicrous, don't you agree? Unless you are pro-crime.
Sure it is a superior and convenient method for the criminal, but is it convenient and superior for the victim? He can't even figure out where the hell to buy the things! And if he does, he's is going to essentially be robbed.

The thing is though, if you look at the timeline, the vast majority of investor and entrepreneurial interest came after the gox-led $266 bubble.  
So at the time a lot of people took interest and thought, 'Wow, looks like something's going on there, there appears to be a lot of interest.'  They were right, there was some interest, but the interest was primarily that of people hoping to buy a winning crypto lottery ticket, and that crypto lottery ticket frenzy seems to have come about because Marky Mark was interested in scraping together some cash to go and bang some sweet Japanese poontang!
Then after that, VC money poured in money chasing some of those crazy bitcoin 'returns.'
