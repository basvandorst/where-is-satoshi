Looks like anything is possible. But if you trust in the saying "history repeats itself" then sell on December ��

I guess a small amount wouldn't hurt. 
I still have like 1.5 Ethereum which I never sold (from like 2 years ago)
Thanks for your input!

Well the drop from 19k-3k does have a explanation. 
A lot of people who bought before the high end of the price wanted to sell off for profit and the people who bought in late because of the hype didn't want to lose their money.
Ended up just being a big sell off while noone wanted it. Sure most people didn't expect it to hit as low as 3k but it was over hyped for it to stay at that price for too long. (obvious captain hindsight but it is logical)
But no hype, no news, no nothing and it spikes to like 14k? Idk i think it's strange. But I guess that's just crypto for you. Always a bit of gambling involved.

I'm talking about the 4k-14k ride.
Was it just random or did some news come out?
I don't think it's normal for something to increase in value by x2-x3 for no reason at all.
It's not like someone has to buy 5 btc for the price to significantly change. A lot of money went in to the price increase.

I feel like 10k is a good price but 100k is a dream

I mean I guess it makes sense that it came back to around the 10k mark but after 2 years of not moving that much all of a suddent this spike.
I want to start investing my spare money so I checked on crypto again. If it's this unstable should probably just go to stocks I guess.

That seems quite optimistic.
