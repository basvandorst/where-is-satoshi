Im so pleased to see BTC actually being used for what it was created .And there were the critics and skeptics that said bitcoin is a fraud ,rat poison ,a bubble that would burst and not end well. I guess they never did get BTC , how something that is intangible has value. A true decentralized global currency/Commodity/means of payment that has real world use . BTC will just grow in time ,today its Venezuela tomorrow the world .So strap on guys its going to be one bumpy ride.

V sad to see money loosing its value .  I really hope and pray that the situation in  Venezuela gets better. The only thing that did not lose value is gold silver and bitcoin .

sell sell sell that Bcash before it touches 0. The fork nobody wanted except of course Roger V  . How long before Bitmain bites the bullet? the Hashrate keeps going up so does that mean they are selling more machines ?  GMO is making some kick ass tech 7nm miners woo hoo . These Japanese guys will be the leaders in mining harware they really know how to innovate.

Since its cheapest in the world to mine BTC in Venezuela . I don't know why they would use bolivars . Just mine BTC . I guess its hard for them to get mining hardware. The petro is a bad idea who would trust it .

Bitmain selling miners for bch is their way of forcing the adoption of BCH to some extent . What happens when bitmain is loosing money will they reduce the hashing power of BCH ? BCH has been the most volatile currency and they want merchants to use it that's just crazy it does have lower transaction fees but if its more volatile than btc then no merchant in their right mind would use it . Bitmain goin the BCH route has come back to bite them in the butt this is what happens when you try to force your shit on the community .

We dont need an ETF but it sure would be nice to have it. Any hoo BAKKT say it with me BAKKT is going to bring wider adoption of BTC which is the more organic way BTC should grow .

WU is a total ripoff . Is there no way you can send btc and they can exchange it for fiat? In dubai they offer BTC to Dhirams i dont know about other Middle eastern countries . I used WU once and i regret it till this day . I normally use paypal which charge a 4% fee. I really hope they start to accept BTC sooner . And the next time you send money it should cost you pennies .

The thing i noticed with paying for stuff with bitcoin was that there is no conversion rate ,for eg if buy something in US dollars using my credit card then i would be charged current bank conversion rate of my local currency to USD. But paying for something using btc is the same price plus a little bit for the transaction fee which i found to be really really good. These banks really screw us over with the fees . I guess when there will be far greater adoption in the future btc payments will be more streamlined and we wont have to worry about refunds if things go sideways.

Bitcoin could eventually but thats going to be awhile . I went to my bank yesterday and they did'nt even know what bitcoin was .

Dont give Dr Doom so much attention we are so close to a bull run and he will be forgotten with the rest of the nay sayers . We need to look ahead so much happening with BTC lightning network , liquid network the moron doesn't get it .He keep talking about scaling did he not read about the lightning network? Im sure he did but chose to ignore it why because it did not fit his agenda.  Good things take time. Bitcoin is the honeybadger it dont care :). Even Warren Buffet regretted not buying into tech stocks simply because he did'nt understand it . We are here because we understand the beauty of  BTC

Well all my alts are worth 1 BTC for now . I will HODL till it goes up .

He is a contrarian and if he bought it at 4000$ that is still a v good price for a long term hold for say next 2 yrs minimum to 5 yrs max. He can easily 10X his investment . Its easier for btc to goto 8000 from 4000 rather than go from 10,000 to 20,000. I wish i had more money i would have bought some .I even put up my Xbox one X for sale to be able to buy some BTC. BTC is falling way too fast and im quite sure it will have a rubber band effect and snap back to 10,000/-.  BTC is here to stay we have established that . Why else would institutions even bother they are too busy pumping and dumping other assets.BTC is a Beast you cant kill it with sticks and stones :) . The beauty of decentralization .
