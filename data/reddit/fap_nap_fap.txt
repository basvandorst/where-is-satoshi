Just move some to an exchange that can connect to a bank account, then wire funds to that account after explaining to it the bank and getting their OK
@_date: 2017-12-05 14:54:42
So sorry to hear about your brother. I don’t know what else to say

transaction ID please
@_date: 2017-12-01 02:04:42
YES! [This]( should do the trick. Good luck!

Good idea. Advertise you have bitcoin to people that want to take it from you!

He’s fucking with you. NO ONE KNOWS WHEN/IF THE PRICE WILL GO UP/DOWN OR THEY WOULD BE TRADING ON IT, NOT LURKING ON REDDIT

What does an exchange acting nefariously have to do with BCH? Could have just as easily been BTC, ETH, etc.
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:26:26
Thank you
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:40:19
I️ don’t believe so, sorry about that. Not sure about Canada 
@_date: 2017-11-09 14:10:40
If the 12-lead spit that out after analyzing your heart, you would be in serious trouble
@_date: 2017-11-11 00:39:42
Lesson learned, whatever amount you lose just chalk it up to the cost of learning
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:42:56
Selling on some heavy volume. Not trying to scare, but could be a short term reversal. Who knows how long that top will be in for though, could literally only be a few hours before it’s broken again hah
@_date: 2017-11-23 19:26:34
Have you uploaded your driver license and uploaded a selfie to the site before?
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:51:34
Do you have an adult friend/relative that you trust and is willing to sign up on an exchange? problem solved!
@_date: 2017-11-23 19:05:51
You’re welcome!
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:41:05
And theeeen...?

My second favorite thing to do!
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:28:35
It won’t be instant, but Gemini is great. Wire all the damn money you want and buy bitcoin to your heart’s content
@_date: 2017-11-03 23:03:42
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:55:59
You are right; it’s nice cold pint
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:53:02
Fortunately or unfortunately, that looks to be the case pretty damn quick
@_date: 2017-11-03 22:51:00
@_date: 2017-11-28 01:08:39
Depends on your other assets. Do you own other stocks, bonds, real estate, etc? Not a bad idea to diversify if you own no crypto. Downside is long term cap gains if you sell the stock as well
@_date: 2017-11-02 18:16:33
@_date: 2017-11-24 03:08:39
If you bought bitcoin and you are holding bitcoin, you are already “long” bitcoin. If you borrowed bitcoin from someone and sold it, hoping to buy it back at a lower price and pocket the difference, you would be “short” bitcoin.
Are you talking about leverage? Because that is different than being long
@_date: 2017-11-23 18:55:54
Don’t tell people what to do with their money unless they’re asking for advice. Also, diversification is not a bad thing when investing 
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:27:26
... but centralization is bad

you're not willing to explain what crypto is? It's a few minute conversation; you aren't trying to convince an atheist God exists or vice-versa.
I guess I should edit my first comment to also say find an adult friend/relative who trusts YOU as well. This includes trusting that you know what you are doing with YOUR money. I have family that would have helped me when I was a minor to buy this - find that adult in your life. 
I would help you, but we don't know each other. Wish there was some kind of escrow for this type of situation to take trust out of the equation. Tough spot to be in. Hope you get it worked out!
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:06:46
Damn, brisket is delicious
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:18:33
Damn, that’s such a bold move! You are such a badass
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:36:53
Care to elaborate?
@_date: 2017-11-03 03:34:50
You can cash out whenever you want, nobody is holding a gun to your head and saying you can’t!
I will tell you that it is a bad idea to ever sell all your bitcoin. Every time I have, I have been worse off than if I just held it
@_date: 2017-11-24 15:02:10
Profound DD
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:21:37
Yes, it’s also on yahoo finance every day too
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:03:44
I don't understand the jump from possible DDOS -&gt; bitcoin cash is behind it
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:43:13
Good info, and well explained. Thank you! You are right, I’d be worried about centralization too given that situation
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:22:07
and what does that have to do with an exchange acting nefariously?
@_date: 2017-11-03 22:52:01
$200 ain't going to kill you. do it
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:26:08
They will do whatever they think will make them the most money
@_date: 2017-11-09 13:56:57
You dropped this: /s
@_date: 2017-11-23 18:59:54
An example: I️ am a business owner and I️ sell something for $50 worth of BTC today. I️ have to claim that $50 as revenue in 2017 but I️ continue to hold it in BTC for 6 months. It is now 2018 and that BTC is now worth $200 and I️ sell it for fiat. I️ have to claim $150 capital gain on my 2018 taxes since the BTC appreciates in value. That make sense?
@_date: 2017-11-23 19:05:32
Not trying to come off harsh, just calling it like I️ see it. No offense meant to OP or anyone else :)
@_date: 2017-11-08 15:15:45
Fall on the knife for us all!
@_date: 2017-11-05 16:22:06
My point is it’s literally typing 4 letters into Google and clicking the first link. Be resourceful. You can do it; I believe in you!
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:19:48
What did the comment say?
@_date: 2017-11-03 04:41:33
That would be a very dumb idea
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:20:07
Show me what you got!
@_date: 2017-09-14 19:18:41
It's the same as the stock market. You borrow (sell) BTC, then buy it back when you want to close out your short position. For example, you short (sell by borrowing) it at 5k, then it drops to 3500 and you buy to close. You make $1500. Make sense?
@_date: 2017-10-31 19:33:41
That is a terrifying rate!
@_date: 2017-10-21 02:53:53
You make a lot of predictions
@_date: 2017-09-14 20:24:03
@_date: 2017-10-20 22:54:44
You must have some solid inside info if you know exactly when it will crash!
@_date: 2017-10-28 14:16:20
@_date: 2017-10-30 01:55:44
People are willing to pay whatever they think bitcoin is worth when they buy it. Right now, they think it’s worth about $6k. A year ago, they thought it was worth a lot less

@_date: 2017-10-21 08:40:52
There is no such thing as a no risk investment
@_date: 2017-10-10 11:36:39
Well hello there
@_date: 2017-10-10 13:15:01
Not sure if you did, but never sell all your BTC!
@_date: 2017-10-17 00:50:38
Suck it up and pay the $25 fee for Gemini. You’ll make that on an uptick in BTC pretty damn quick if you put anything in the 4 digit+ range in fiat...
@_date: 2017-10-20 22:59:52
I think the worst drop was $32 to $2. Obviously quite awhile ago but pretty devastating at the time
@_date: 2017-10-22 22:54:24
Definitely. You should also visit r/wallstreetbets
@_date: 2017-10-30 03:29:52
Damn, that’s quite a gamble. Good luck

What’s the $100 club? Owning more than $100 worth of BTC?
@_date: 2017-10-21 03:52:29
Never sell all you BTC
@_date: 2017-10-22 21:29:38
@_date: 2017-10-30 01:47:04

Leg into it, buy £1000 worth a week each week for the next 5 weeks
@_date: 2017-10-14 16:30:27
Go to investopedia and look up dollar cost averaging (I’m on mobile or I’d link it for you). That’ll explain the reasoning behind not doing all 5k at once. Other than that check the top posts all time in this sub and that will be a good guide for you. Good luck!

Put the crackpipe down. It's at 2234
@_date: 2017-05-27 04:26:40
Go to coinbase.com and you can see the current price
@_date: 2017-05-27 16:21:17
What platform do you use to short?
@_date: 2017-05-27 05:20:41
Good to know, thanks!
@_date: 2017-05-29 00:00:00
you know what... I think you may be on to something!
@_date: 2017-05-27 00:32:01
If bitcoin price was stable, the way to go would be to short the crap out of this
@_date: 2017-05-27 16:24:22
Thank you!
@_date: 2017-05-25 18:27:49
buying bitcoin takes 2 minutes online, if you can reply to my previous comment then you definitely have enough time to buy
@_date: 2017-05-27 03:25:47
I'm not trying to be a dick when I say this, but I understand the basics of the market. What I'm wondering is if this fund just tries to mirror the price of bitcoin like an index fund.
Who are the "some" people that you are talking about? All bitcoin traders? I was specifically talking about this fund, not all people interested in bitcoin
@_date: 2017-05-27 03:06:22
I get that you can be long and short, but your previous comment suggested they are only short because you said "they short bitcoin"
@_date: 2017-05-27 16:20:33
Wire transfer to Gemini. Buy as much as you want
@_date: 2017-05-27 02:29:57

buy on an exchange right now and set your wallet up, then transfer in a day or 2
@_date: 2017-05-28 03:22:26
you can't shit a shitter
@_date: 2017-05-24 01:39:08
and then roll over and take a nap
@_date: 2017-06-02 02:14:49
could be 3 weeks or so. Not sure on other exchanges, just don't use coinbase. Shit is a rip off
@_date: 2017-06-02 01:50:39
nope, Gemini's are crazy low. I think you signed up at the same time as everyone else when the whole craze was going on. It'll settle down and you'll be able to buy there soon. Patience
@_date: 2017-06-11 05:44:35
If a bitcoin is worth one quadrillionth of a penny, it would still be worth more than its weight in gold (since it weighs nothing)
