It's not that ASICs are not viable; they'll be the *only* way to mine from August onwards. As more ASICs come online and difficulty rises, it will take longer to recover your initial investment. So, it will be a case of trying to find hardware for a good price, deploying it in a location with cheap electricity and waiting for a considerable time (compared to mining to date).
The days of casual mining are coming to a close. If you want to mine in future, it will be a full time job managing a room full of ASICs bought with a sizeable capital investment.

No. What I'm saying is, if you are running a business that sells widgets for $0.01 and I buy 100 of them, I should pay you $1 once rather than $0.01 100 times. 
The transaction fee should be set at a level to encourage that behaviour but not enforce it.

I really hope OT gains some traction. It will solve a huge number of problems at once and will be able to provide the anonymity that Zerocoin can but without messing with the blockchain.

They don't have to. Just take the measures that seem appropriate.
Not everybody with cash will go to the trouble of installing a big fireproof safe either. For most people, they might keep some cash on them, some lying around the house and most of it in the bank.
The same pattern will probably emerge as bitcoin gains mainstream acceptance. Secure (probably insured) "banks" will appear and they will deal with most of the security (for a fee, of course).
You will still be able to 'be your own bank', but options will become available for the people who are not willing or able to put the required thought into security.
If you can't wait for the likes of blockchain.info to evolve or for bigger players to enter the market, then feel free to build your own solution. Start a business as a bitcoin bank.

How soon you can deploy should be a major factor in your decision.
ASICMiner will be deploying ~250 TH/s over the next few months. They could deploy right now, but they want to stay between 10-20% of the network.
Hundreds of thousands of Avalon chips (280 MH/s each) will come online over the next couple of months, so add another couple of hundred TH/s.
BFL's miners will be delivered *any day now^tm*, so add another couple of hundred TH/s.
My guess is that we will be looking at a total hash rate of &gt;1,000 TH/s by the end of the year.
5 GH/s out of 100 TH/s = 0.18 BTC/day  
5 GH/s out of 250 TH/s = 0.072 BTC/day  
5 GH/s out of 500 TH/s = 0.036 BTC/day  
5 GH/s out of 1,000 TH/s = 0.018 BTC/day
BFL's 5 GH/s unit at today's rates is roughly 2.1 BTC. Your return will depend heavily on the delivery date. If you got it right now, you'd be into profit after 12 days. If it arrives in July, 60 days. December, 120+ days and so on.

This is the problem at hand. If the fee is too high, you won't buy your coffee. If there is no transaction fee, your transaction may not end up in a block. If you decide to pay a tiny fee, your transaction might not be confirmed for a long time so you might have to wait a few days to get that coffee. 
Setting a default fee is a good idea so people's transactions are likely to be included in the next x blocks, where x is a reasonable number. Deciding on what that fee should be is tricky. 
At the end of the day, it's just the default and can be changed as you see fit. If you want to take your chances, pay no fee. If it's a high priority transaction, pay a high fee. If you just want the damn thing to work, pay the default fee. That default fee must be determined somehow and it's value will determine how most casual users will interact with the network.

Anyway, that's one of the risks you take in arbitrage. If it was risk free easy money, we'd all be doing it.

It does work, I've done it myself several times. Once the key is imported you'll either have to rescan the block chain manually or just restart the bitcoin-qt client for your wallet to show the balance for that key.
If you just want to see if the private key was imported correctly you can use validateaddress:
    validateaddress &lt;address&gt;
    {
    "isvalid" : true,
    "address" : "&lt;address&gt;",
    "ismine" : true,
    --more stuff--
    }
If the key was not imported properly, "ismine" will be false.
Edit: Bad terminology.

They'd make roughly 0.5 BTC each per day. Closer to 0.45 BTC if all of these came online at the same time.

The blockchain is essentially an accounting ledger. It is made up of blocks. Blocks consist of a bunch of transactions like "Alice paid Bob 2 BTC" and "Carol paid Alice 1 BTC".
Miners collect some transactions and perform a difficult mathematical operation on them (finding a nonce and hashing). If the miner can produce a result which is acceptable to the rest of the network, he is rewarded with some bitcoins.
Miners are basically accountants who write transactions into the shared ledger (blockchain). They get paid for performing this service. The method they use to do this accounting is designed to be very difficult so if someone wanted to forge a previous transaction, he would have to redo all these difficult calculations (which is very, very expensive).

Exactly. Just look at the transaction tsunami from Satoshi Dice. 
If the transaction fee is too low, the network gets flooded with 100 million transactions of 1 satoshi each, rather than a single 1 BTC transaction.
Keeping the transaction fee high will encourage a lower number of high value transactions. So if you were running a gambling service like Satoshi Dice, your users deposit a larger number of BTC in one transaction into their SD account. They then perform lots of little transactions on SD's system and cash out back to BTC in a large transaction.
This keeps the blockchain clean and offloads the billions of microtransactions to the owner of the service rather than the (publicly used) network.
Of course, a problem arises when you need to make a small personal transaction. Here you will have to use another service, where you make a large(ish) deposit transaction, make your microtransactions on the service, then make a large(ish) withdrawal back to BTC.
People already do this with currency exchanges, stock brokers and other services. It's not an alien concept to most people. 
The trick may be treating bitcoin transactions much like current (fiat) inter-bank transfers; a useful network for moving a decent amount of cash. We can then use other systems like Ripple, LiteCoin or some private service to perform the little stuff (essentially acting like PayPal and creditcards are used now). This is just moving the problem around (well, distributing it among several networks), but it will probably have to be done at some point.
The difficulty lies in setting an appropriate level for the transaction fee to find a good balance. Setting the fee to be related to a basket of fx rates and/or commodity prices might be the best way to go, but it would have to be implemented very carefully.

No problem.  
Delivery dates are anybody's guess.
At this stage, ordering mining gear is essentially gambling on who you think will deliver first. ASICMiner auctioned off 60 of their 10 GH/s blades and delivered immediately (they have hundreds on hand), but the price was ridiculous. People were willing to pay a premium to have equipment up and running straight away. Of course, the higher price pushed ROI further back ...

It depends on how you want to deal with risk.
If it is a low risk transaction, proceed as soon as payment is made.  
If it's slightly riskier (possible double spending), wait 1 block (~10 mins).  
As risk increases, wait for more block confirmations.  
If it's high risk, wait for 6 confirmations (~1 hr) or more.
It's entirely up to the merchant to determine the cost/benefit of waiting for more transaction confirmations. Or you could use a different blockchain like Litecoin which has a faster block generation (x4 faster), but which is less commonly used, or Ripple which is a whole other social lending/trust thing.

That's about all I've got. I don't mine anymore, I just like to have a rough idea of what's going on.

Wallet management in the bitcoind and bitcoin-qt client is not pretty. The wallet needs to be in *.bitcoin/wallet.dat* unfortunately. Also, anytime you run the client and there is no *.bitcoin/wallet.dat*, it will create a new one (with new key pool etc).
What you can do is create a symlink to your wallet on the TrueCrypt volume.  
First, make sure the client is not running. Then:
    cd ~/.bitcoin
    mv wallet.dat /path/to/truecryptvolume/bitcoin_wallet.dat
    ln -s /path/to/truecryptvolume/bitcoin_wallet.dat wallet.dat
You should now have a symlink in *.bitcoin* pointing to a real *wallet.dat* file on your truecrypt volume. Repeat for litecoin.
This *should* work, I don't use TrueCrypt myself, so I'm not certain. It may cause problems if TrueCrypt is not running when the client is started. So make backups and experiment.
The official client can encrypt the wallet in-situ as well. You can always use other clients like [Multibit]( or [Electrum]( too.
Re. shredding. Yup, it's a good way to securely delete data. The problem with simple deletion (*rm file.txt*) is that the data still exists. To prevent possible recovery, you can overwrite the file and then delete it. This is what shred does.  
The following is a reasonably good approach.
    shred -f -z -u -n 9 &lt;file_to_delete&gt;
It overwrites &lt;file_to_delete&gt; 9 times, once more with all zeros, then deletes it.
