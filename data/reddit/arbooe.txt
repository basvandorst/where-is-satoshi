Yeah, but did you read the post though? It's an idea on how to incentivize coinbase to use segwit.
@_date: 2018-01-13 20:20:36
How can you use segwit, let alone LN when you want to buy btc for usd via coinbase?
It's the worse offender when it comes to wasting blockchain space (as the recent outage has shown), and their CEO roots for bitcoin to fail. I don't think they're ever going to add SW at this rate.

translated: "you have to trust me"
@_date: 2018-01-13 20:24:50
Well less pressure on the blockchain doesn't mean the development of new scaling tech is stopped, right?
@_date: 2018-01-09 11:56:35
Yeah, but it's not like you can't continue to develop LN, segwit, schnorr etc. after increasing block size. My point is that we need a resolution urgently, and this one can be done instantly and is guaranteed to bring relief.
@_date: 2018-01-09 12:04:20
The point is immediate relief. Even 2mb blocks would decrease fees, reduce some of the market share and give time for the devs to finish LN. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 11:35:51
Are they giving any estimates as to when there will be a real solution? It seems to me that the only advantage BTC has at the moment is the adoption which it loses every day, and if other coin overtakes, there will be no coming back.
@_date: 2018-01-09 12:15:37
Centralization's a bad thing, I agree. But why do you think those demands will work? Exchanges will be just as happy to accept eth or whatever instead of bitcoin after it dies.
@_date: 2018-01-09 11:37:05
I read the comments in the recent story about microsoft dropping bitcoin and it seemed to me that people finally stop pretending that there's no sinking this ship.
@_date: 2018-01-14 11:49:22
How is it a good thing?
@_date: 2018-01-13 20:32:05
You, me, this whole sub amounts to a tiny fraction of on-chain transactions. Coinbase is half the reason the tx are so slow and expensive currently, and fixing that would have a massive positive effect on bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-13 20:50:32
Yeah sure why don't they postpone an urgent update to the currency that has 2x more volume than the next largest one in favor of adding n+1st altcoin. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 12:11:10
Can you please explain what magic is in the 1MB number? If satoshi would choose 0.5 or 2 MB from the get go, would it make bitcoin fail? What about 1.01 MB?
@_date: 2018-01-09 12:13:15
There's a couple of minutes left till this thread is deleted, please tell me where I'm wrong.
@_date: 2018-01-13 23:11:29
Well what other options are there? What if coinbase et al. never implement segwit, LN etc, and you forever need to pay $30 per tx?
@_date: 2018-01-09 11:45:56
Yeah, my point was the change in the mindset of people here. I felt like some time ago nobody here cared about the fees, and now people finally start to wake up.
@_date: 2018-01-09 12:08:04
How is bitcoin more valuable than numerous other coins that give the same + low to zero fees and fast to instant transactions? It's the adoption and it's dropping fast.
If the merchants/exchanges aren't using segwit or LN now, they will not magically start using it after you sign petition number n + 1. Larger blocks are guaranteed to be used since miners will want to take more block reward, it's going to give instant improvement compared to LN that is not going to be finished before it's too late.
@_date: 2018-01-13 20:39:24
Their users pay the fees, they don't care whether those a high or low. BTW their CEO [seems to want bitcoin to fail](
@_date: 2018-01-10 09:38:09
What? There are other coins that are better in every regard, once they have the adoption, nobody is going to use bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-14 00:04:44
Well LN is opt-in like segwit, right? SW has been around for months now and coinbase never used it, why would it be any different with LN?
@_date: 2018-01-09 12:47:13
Are you sure that these scaling technologies will see large scale adoption before another coin replaces bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-12-13 09:14:09
mentioning BCH in a positive context on r/bitcoin? that's a bold strategy
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:24:48
Yeah and even if their blocks ever become full-ish, they'll just bump the block size again instead of waiting for ~~segwit~~ ~~lightning network~~ whatever
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:39:41
Don't their doors open upwards?
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:30:37
Honest question: won't the miners go back to mining BCH after the BTC tx fees go down, since it will (probably) be more profitable since they'll be able to stuff 8x more transactions in one block?
@_date: 2017-03-09 11:55:22
Finally a solid prediction I can behind!
@_date: 2017-08-23 08:44:49
Would the fee really be that different?
@_date: 2017-08-23 10:22:28
You're only allowed to post rollercoaster memes and the hodl bullshit. No one on this sub is concerned about the fees because no one here uses bitcoin as currency
@_date: 2017-11-22 09:08:37
This. About a week or two earlier I went to bitcoinfees site and saw that 11 sat/b should get me confirmed within 5 hours (like it says right now). The transaction didn't get confirmed for almost 3 days!
Say what you want, but in its current form, bitcoin is a crap currency, whose only advantages compared to visa are non-reversibility and anonymity, which are both things you usually don't really want.
@_date: 2017-11-18 10:23:24
We're not - bitcoin can be lower than 10k this year, and hit 500k the next one. Not that this is a bad scenario
@_date: 2017-04-26 18:58:47


Says here you can wire to a bank 
@_date: 2017-04-26 18:48:34
Could anyone please explain how such big differences are possible? Can't one just buy on BTC-E for 1278 and sell on bitfinex at $130 profit per coin?
@_date: 2018-02-21 17:54:31
Bitcoin users left, only speculators remain. Thankfully bitcoin price has little to do with usage
@_date: 2018-02-07 07:27:52
What are you talking about? A lot of altcoins have fixed supply like bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-26 13:16:50
yeah but they want cash in the end
@_date: 2018-02-06 20:34:15
Yeah but why would such people care about the price?
@_date: 2018-12-05 09:01:28


@_date: 2017-06-02 15:10:31
Easy - register a separate wallet for each transaction, then send the money by e-mailing required wallets where you want. 0 transaction fee like in the good old days! /s
@_date: 2013-05-06 15:24:20
Why is it important? If you don't trust dropbox, you can't trust encryption provided by them.
