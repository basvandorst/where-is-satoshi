Bitcoin payment was temporarily removed when we did an overhaul of our site. cleverbridge (the image you showed!) does not actually support Bitcoin, we had to use Coinbase externally. We should have it back in a week or so on the product pages!
@_date: 2014-02-05 19:58:38
Hmm, depending on volume. We'd have to make a custom purchase page, etc.
@_date: 2014-07-21 16:42:59
This might be a f/p. I've reported it to the team and will get back to you when I hear something!
@_date: 2014-04-15 15:02:33
My pleasure.

Sorry, I don't think I was clear after re-reading that. Any keys purchased before 2.0 release will be grandfathered in as lifetime licenses.

We were *very* bad at corporate sales a few years ago. Try contacting us today, even if you have no intention of purchasing, and let me know if our process has improved!

If you don't hear from me in a week, please deliver me a swift kick in the ass so I can get this back up? Much appreciated.
@_date: 2014-02-05 15:46:02
Thanks man. Just trying to fix computers for a living, I love it.
@_date: 2014-02-05 20:22:41
There's a button for it on the front page of the website, malwarebytes.org.
@_date: 2014-02-05 16:55:02
We use cleverbridge for our order processing and they don't support it yet!
@_date: 2014-02-05 15:21:58
Your wish is my command!
@_date: 2014-02-05 20:35:32
I agree, not intuitive. Let me talk to the developers!
@_date: 2014-03-08 07:43:39
You rock!
@_date: 2014-02-05 19:34:22
Approaching 100 users! It's only been 3 hours.
@_date: 2014-02-05 17:42:45
is something I watch every day, you are all a great group of people.
@_date: 2014-08-04 16:35:30
It only gets 2-3 sales per day; we can't exactly flash it in bright colors all over the website :)
@_date: 2014-03-08 02:11:21
Unfortunately cleverbridge won't let us put this directly into our cart. You can find it on the main product page.
Scroll down just beneath the fold and you'll see an orange button.
Thanks for supporting us!

Unfortunately our payment provider cleverbridge does not accept Bitcoin, so it wasn't as easy as dropping it into our cart. We're trying to make it a bit more seamless though.
@_date: 2014-02-05 15:29:12
I woke up and it was live.
@_date: 2014-04-16 05:46:53
Bitcoin payment didn't work? Let me know if that's the case as it hasn't been reported.
@_date: 2014-02-05 01:36:49
Shhhh, this wasn't supposed to go live yet! But it's true, later this evening we'll be flipping the switch.
@_date: 2014-02-05 19:58:12
Yes, but only before March 24th.
@_date: 2014-07-22 00:57:44
This is certainly a false positive and we've fixed it in our upcoming build. You can get a preview here -- 
@_date: 2014-02-05 15:28:54
You've blown my cover!
@_date: 2014-02-05 18:45:11
We decided to use the BTC as well, not just cashing in on the USD.
@_date: 2013-12-26 15:51:51
I jumped on the bandwagon when everyone did. I just think it's amazing a cryptocurrency like this can exist and I want to encourage it's use. We're even thinking about accepting it at Malwarebytes!
@_date: 2013-12-22 02:10:49
Almost a rip-off of it. Also says "A significant amount of bitcoins in your wallets are kept in offline wallets that are secured in bank vaults" which is on the front page of Coinbase.
@_date: 2013-04-05 18:25:08
Thanks, I'll point someone from our team here!
@_date: 2013-12-23 17:12:30
I dabble everywhere on reddit. Nice to meet you!
