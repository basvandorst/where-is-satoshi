let's make this man mayor of London! Hell, let's make him President of the United States!!!

but isn't bitcoin literally money? while our dollar bills are only currency?
@_date: 2014-02-13 20:18:22
it’s not backed by gold?…uhhhh yeah the USD isn’t either! it's value fluctuates?….uhhhh yeah the USD does too! He says you could go to buy a hotdog and the value of bitcoin could drop before you’re done with the transaction…but the transaction is instant. He says it’s “not a real money”….uhhhhh I think that’s what the British empire would have said when we started printing US dollars
@_date: 2014-12-26 05:45:17
this should read "stay away from Bitcoin as an investment"
@_date: 2014-02-28 16:47:12
Aspen it is.
@_date: 2014-03-08 17:10:36
so do it
@_date: 2017-02-03 19:02:29
Hahahaha this question is just overflowing with false premises IMO
@_date: 2015-01-18 03:03:53
any idea where this stat is from? I 100% believe it...wouldn't be surprised if it's more like 20-1 or higher
@_date: 2015-01-18 03:02:54
you know....there used to be a time when people's communications were all in person. and we still managed to stop terrorists, even though we couldn't listen in on their phone calls as easily. And cops can still tap phones if they have warrants, but nowadays the judges are letting the cops write their own warrants so I guess it wouldn't be that different...
I think the wack a mole scenario is the most likely. and since they can't get everyone who is breaking the law, they'll just end up targeting the people they already want to take down using the new laws....like how they took down Al Capone for his taxes...
@_date: 2015-01-18 04:44:28
lol...ok good phew
@_date: 2015-01-18 03:05:44
especially not compared to the amount of people Israel kills....am I the only one who thinks we need to stop supporting them? we've already given them enough weapons and money to last until the apocalypse, which will probably be soon if we don't stop
edit: weapons *and money*
@_date: 2015-01-02 02:54:53
not to detract from this....but there's already an endless supply of free porn on the internet
@_date: 2015-01-18 02:55:46
doesn't mean they won't try their hardest...if we let them
@_date: 2015-01-18 18:24:23
yeah....we're the dynamic duo of fucking shit up. we need to stop blowing up other countries, I think that's something most american's agree about
@_date: 2015-01-18 03:09:44
....the front door of the house is open. the house would be more secure if the doors could be locked
@_date: 2015-01-18 02:54:45
Bingo. he's trying to be all things to all people, like always. he's trying to pretend like he cares about net neutrality while still pushing through the agenda of the big media interests (and big government interests) that want to have unlimited control over our data and communications
@_date: 2015-01-18 02:57:09
yeah! join team fuck obama! until he actually starts representing the people who elected him. end the wars, don't start more! pass laws for less indefinite detention, not more! if you think this is bad, check out the NDAA
@_date: 2015-01-24 01:31:49
well I'll be damned, it looks like Alex Jones was right...
@_date: 2015-01-19 05:01:58
oh thanks! yeah I think I remember hearing like 16 people died last year from terrorism or something like that....
seems to me, no matter how scary 9/11 was, we should still not give up all our rights just for a little perceived safety
@_date: 2015-01-18 06:39:10


Obama trying to be all things to all people. that's the best way to sum him up. 
@_date: 2017-03-23 15:08:43
Isn't it pointing out that this guy is shaming and blaming actual bitcoin? I don't even know who that's supposed to be, I'm not caught up on bitcoin news....but that's what it looks like. 
@_date: 2016-01-26 21:44:46
Bounty?  Or reward? 
@_date: 2016-01-16 20:27:27
yeah the money changers have scaled themselves up a little bit since last time...Jesus would certainly have his hands full today
@_date: 2017-03-23 15:09:03
who is this guy? I'm behind on my bitcoin news...
@_date: 2017-03-23 19:20:09
it's vilifying this dude for his opinion on what solution is best? I don't know the pros/cons of either solution, I'm gonna need to get caught up on this I guess. 
@_date: 2017-03-23 19:18:49
ahh...I really need to get caught up on this it looks like, thanks.
@_date: 2017-03-23 19:28:52
huh, well better late than never... if it's a debate that's tearing apart the bitcoin community, I at least want to figure out which side I think is better to be on! although I'm sure neither solution is perfect so who knows...
@_date: 2017-03-23 19:30:00
hmmm...sounds very contentious. I'll have to tread very lightly and I'll try to refrain from really committing. it's starting to sound like the Democrat Republican debate, where neither side is one you *really* want to be on. 
@_date: 2016-01-16 08:20:59
a banker praying is so ironic...the only time Jesus got violent in his entire life was when he fucked up those money changers
@_date: 2019-11-11 04:39:37
"more importantly, I sell gold, I don't sell bitcoin"
@_date: 2018-10-05 11:05:51
It's all relative...
@_date: 2017-08-16 00:26:32
not money, "currency" :)
@_date: 2017-01-11 21:00:34
Nsfw? Really?
@_date: 2016-11-07 20:37:03
great! if you could also teach me to use bitcoin... I set up a wallet a while ago but the process wasn't exactly what I would describe as stream-lined...
@_date: 2019-08-05 20:23:20
how much did that baby cost you? a couple bucks?
@_date: 2019-08-08 11:04:14
Notice it says money, not currency
@_date: 2015-08-10 12:31:41
Next thing you know we won't be allowed to legally lock our front doors. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 20:24:08
NOW my Dad will finally start to take Bitcoin seriously
@_date: 2015-07-15 18:32:50
surely because he sees a money-making opportunity somehow
@_date: 2017-04-24 17:24:39
[MadTV anyone?](
@_date: 2017-04-04 19:07:04
but he's going to the bookstore for information on bitcoin.....shakes head.... 
@_date: 2018-11-27 01:48:43
that made laugh. although I own exactly 0.0 bitcoin so maybe that's why...
@_date: 2018-11-27 01:49:22
hmm the aim might have been a slight bit off the mark....looks like we're adding a record size crater to the moon in this pic.
@_date: 2018-03-27 20:42:27
I'm not a fan of that either
@_date: 2016-09-06 16:48:36
right after he comes out against the TPP, he goes and says something like this
@_date: 2017-04-24 11:05:33
second favorite Bobby Lee
@_date: 2017-10-26 12:44:16
it's all relative
@_date: 2018-03-27 14:33:53
unless of course he actually did try to organize murders on the dark web....then rot in prison.
@_date: 2015-11-22 18:30:05
hey, maybe Apple ISN'T going to completely go down the tubes now that Steve Jobs is gone...
@_date: 2016-10-06 14:33:14
half of these images are so similar to eachother lol
@_date: 2015-10-25 21:22:55
it's just not at the point yet where the ease of use outweighs the hesitation to try something new... I even tried to figure out how to buy some bitcoin twice in the past and quickly gave up each time because it wasn't easy enough. 
@_date: 2015-11-12 18:54:10
but something tells me this won't be a 9-0 decision like it should be
@_date: 2015-02-09 06:12:37
until we have computer networks on other planets...hey that's not too far of a reach
@_date: 2015-10-26 15:00:13
hmm maybe I'll check that out. I set up a wallet and everything but just never could figure out how to buy any...even though I was using a site that a lot of people said was one of the best. maybe I'll give it another shot
@_date: 2015-02-05 21:29:55
hmmmm....I'll stick with getting 100% of my porn for free online without the guilt of knowing I'm a pirate
@_date: 2017-06-06 15:57:13
for me: 
install bitcoin wallet. try to figure out how it works, fail miserably, decide to wait until it's streamlined and easier to figure out.
