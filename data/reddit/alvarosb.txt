He should be banned from all media.
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:59:56
He is fucking awesome
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:15:33
This is neither martingale nor ponzi. This is a revolution
@_date: 2018-09-14 11:18:09
1000x for him no problem. They make money in bull or bear market anyways. They just need users. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:11:32
For me It would be harder to realize I missed a life time opportunity in 1 or 2 years from now.
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:19:59
I admire Andreas but I disagree. We have to fight for what is right. BTC is Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-08-26 19:30:27
Actually Bitcoin is the protocol (or the payment network) and bitcoin is the currency. 
@_date: 2018-08-23 16:11:51
Dont forget printing money and delivery
@_date: 2018-08-25 12:19:02
No one really knows. He was positive in bitcoin futures and see what happened... 
@_date: 2018-05-01 12:09:06
Not fixed. BTC is Bitcoin, not Bitcoin Core.

No dollar symbol, please

We have seen much bigger drops in the past. Come on guys! Do you think crypto millionaires didnt suffer drops on the way??
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:20:40
I agree. But I see ethereum adopting Raiden this month and it's hard to understand that bitcoin doesnt have clear roadmap yet. Long live to bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-14 15:58:54
this is good for Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 06:53:00
@_date: 2017-11-12 15:00:30
Not angry...
@_date: 2017-11-11 06:58:07
Yeah, many of us are engineers, and? Do you know more about the bitcoin architecture details than the core devs? No. And if you do, then colaborate with the project, It is open source. .
@_date: 2019-06-23 10:40:41
Just buy and hold in cold storage
@_date: 2017-11-18 20:06:06
Did someone reach to this guy? haha
@_date: 2019-04-13 06:10:12
Is this Technical or Fundamental analysis? I see you are a finance expert
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:49:24

You are right only in part. It is true that the prívate key thing is a problem but It is the only way you are the owner of your money. Most wallets only require a password already. I am sure banks will accept bitcoin accounts and It would make It easier but you are again depending on third party. Also, there are already tools to recover your prívate key in case of lose, for example uPort.
@_date: 2017-09-24 18:10:58
Protected? Ask people from Greece...
@_date: 2017-09-25 14:14:26
Correct. Only thing you need to do is refill your wallet after purchasing with bitcoin. That way you can use btc as payment and investment.
@_date: 2017-10-22 15:02:40
That might buy a car one day...
@_date: 2017-09-17 18:27:00
I think you will cash out before :p
@_date: 2017-09-23 13:16:59
I hope it is true. This is exactly what bitcoin needs...
@_date: 2017-10-21 15:47:17
So true
@_date: 2018-04-08 14:17:35
McAfee is making money regardless of bull or bear market...
@_date: 2017-07-05 14:12:45
I meant, transactions per second
@_date: 2018-12-31 17:39:17
Make richer the rich. Is this how they plan to bring digital assets to masses? 
@_date: 2017-06-03 07:31:49
Exactly. The graph shows that bitcoin price is increasing 2x per year approx. In 2013 it increased way faster.
@_date: 2017-06-03 06:20:03
 Rapid price increase of an asset that generate expectations of future grows without any risks
@_date: 2019-05-02 16:09:50
Gold limited supply? Hell no!
@_date: 2017-06-02 18:05:11
in 2014, 2013's bubble burst and trend went back to normal
@_date: 2017-07-05 14:33:45
Lightning network?
@_date: 2018-12-29 22:23:16
@_date: 2018-12-29 21:05:22
Good point
@_date: 2017-06-02 17:58:08
bubble was in 2013, what we have now is no bubble
@_date: 2017-06-03 07:46:12
$10,000 is reliable by 2020. If it reaches that price before 2019 it will drop rapidly
@_date: 2017-06-03 07:48:44
Really? 200% per year is nothing???
@_date: 2017-06-03 07:13:28
Subjetive? That's the formal definition lol
