Thanks, can you expand on this a bit? Is there no reset because it isn't as safe? Perhaps the old key could be recovered somehow after a potential reset and this makes it better safe than sorry? Just want to understand why it's better, appreciate the response.

You are correct

I believe they recently added LN, but yes supposedly they have been accepting btc for a while.

"Bitcoin hasn't come into a stage yet where it could build any hurdles against the further use of bitcoins which have been used for illegal activities before."
Like chainalysis? They have real time tracking of coins and how recently it was possibly used for illicit activities.

That, or if you want to move it now you can always put a really low fee and have it take a while, then if you're going to need to move it quicker in the future it'll be in a bc1 address and be cheaper at that time.
Edit: actually I'm not positive of this, if someone wants to correct my understanding I'd be happy for you to.

After 13 pin attempts its bricked bricked, not just reset like ledger does? Just clarifying, will likely order one :)

I would have to guess he's talking about Cuba, not the world, since that is what the article is about.

I think its a joke bc there's a bag in the picture

I Googled it and the primary source seems to be the below article. Good read.

My link is to the Sydney Morning Herald and the beginning of their article says this was an interview with them and 'The Age'. There may be an interview with that one somewhere too but unless the interview was recorded I think this article is as good as its going to get. Below is a media bias/fact check for SMH and they get 'high' for factual reporting.

Agree, almost there! it is currently 5 below.

That looks really good, thanks for posting. The article in the tweet is a good read too.
