Guns is the odd one out. It sounds so weird in the middle of that
@_date: 2016-08-20 17:25:46
Oh I get it now. They are all things to have, and some people rather you don't have them. Thanks
@_date: 2016-08-20 19:14:08
Well, I understand, but to be fair, It's really harder to imagine a lot of ways people can harm others using weed, gay marriage or bitcoins
@_date: 2016-08-20 15:11:18
How does that relate to the others?
@_date: 2017-02-20 20:24:54
But it's less than 1100...
@_date: 2017-02-21 11:48:29
What the fack
@_date: 2017-02-20 21:14:49
That's fair. But why dollars?

In which case the pedal position would register at 0% in the logs
@_date: 2017-02-20 19:58:40
What's special about $1000 ?

Note that is *NOT* an "alternate bitcoin centered subreddit". I spend more time there. It's more like . Literally the majority of content there is about the censorship in this subreddit and the block size debate. Almost no talk about mining, trading, or anything else.
I'm not saying they are wrong. I'm just saying they are not self aware.
@_date: 2017-03-18 22:11:44
Basically, people who support Segwit are the real "experts" and people who support BU are not but they assume they know better than experts or they are just trolling.
@_date: 2017-03-16 06:41:26


That's what I was looking for, thanks
@_date: 2017-03-07 22:18:58
What? The pedals of the Tesla can move without user input?
@_date: 2017-03-18 22:01:24
Same here. 
It's like the more I read, the less I know about it
@_date: 2017-03-07 22:20:34
Holy shit
@_date: 2017-03-16 06:39:19
Seriously, grandma move right there

2 weeks after PayPal withdraws from Turkey... thanks
@_date: 2017-01-13 08:12:40
Probably because they weren't aware that what they were doing was wrong. We were asked to do something similar in our company, and everyone was fine with it. I managed to convince some people but others said I was making a big deal out of nothing.
@_date: 2017-08-29 16:54:54
Yes but weren't we expecting it to get less severe as time goes on?
@_date: 2017-08-22 20:30:58
Well, that's not a good way to demonstrate that it is for everyone
@_date: 2017-08-29 12:18:41
Seriously, what's up with the transaction rates? I dared to move 0.03BTC the other day and it cost me the equivalent of 3 Big Mac Menu's

@_date: 2016-11-04 09:36:39
Isn't it equivalent to writing them a blank check? If they mess up my transaction or charge more money than I agreed on, I would have no options of recourse...
@_date: 2016-12-02 11:39:14
It's due to the new presidential system, lot's of uncertainty and insecurities all around.
Irrelevant to the sub though.
It's kinda interesting to see BTC - TRY exchange increasing exponentially right now. Made me miss the whole scene
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:18:30
Good luck explaining your reasoning to Apple
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:17:26
I don't get it. The problem is that BCH is the first option? Are you all calling murder for a UI change?
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:19:58
Is Bitcoin a trademark?
If so is it owned by you?
What you are doing is abusing the flag system.
@_date: 2017-11-20 15:19:18
First of all, it's not a "copy". It's a fork. It is based on the same code developed by the same people.
Secondly, no matter who uses it, decentralized cryptocurrencies do not belong to any nation or government, so saying they are Chinese is misleading
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:52:21
I get that. It would have been better if they used another name but in their defense, the difference is so small and so non-fundamental that each coin could reasonably call itself the actual Bitcoin. BTCs claim to the name is only that it came first, which is a valid claim but I wouldn't put it the same place I would put an original Gucci handbag in relation to a knockoff
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:12:00
You keep repeating "scam" . Could you explain exactly what you mean by that? It might be confusing but nobody is stealing anyones money. Or are they?
@_date: 2017-11-01 10:41:52
Hey why do you say that? Can't we be happy that something we put low risk baby steps into, rather than our life savings is actually panning out?
@_date: 2017-11-07 21:31:51
Seriously. I have been seeing a lot of banner ads from Bitcoin related companies for a while and that's normal for me but now I started to see them on devices where I'm not even logged in. It has pretty much entered the mainstream
@_date: 2017-11-20 14:12:57
@_date: 2017-11-20 16:52:35
Why don't you explain it?
@_date: 2017-11-20 15:13:54
Well yeah, obviously, it is different. But for the purposes of wallets, they are the same. They branched off from the same implementation. [Here is an explanation](
@_date: 2017-04-01 10:09:32
The OS was G, the AS was VG, thanks for T'n my D and letting me J you a PN, your M in my F was A-OK and I'm sorry I lost control of my B
@_date: 2017-10-17 13:03:03
How is that related?
@_date: 2017-10-18 08:33:55
Also you can invest in other cryptocurrencies too
@_date: 2017-10-26 05:57:32
I have seen many times people speculate on the effects of halving or forks. They very rarely hit the point. It's just so random.
Do whatever you like
@_date: 2016-10-27 04:54:38
Wow. That's a very bad name 
@_date: 2016-10-30 07:45:44
How dare you disturb our circlejerk by such senseless facts from an official founder of the actual party and all that nonsense
@_date: 2016-10-27 07:45:34
Psychologically different, technically same
@_date: 2017-05-24 11:40:50
Yes, you can spend. But, until the time comes when you can sustain your current life by spending just bitcoin, it would remain similar to stocks i.e. you are only rich after you sell
@_date: 2017-05-24 11:37:24
Hodler be like "Wake me up when it's 5 digits"
@_date: 2017-05-02 17:52:53
It is really mind boggling. I have decided to not try to understand why Bitcoin soars or falls. It seems to obey no reason or logic
@_date: 2016-07-08 21:44:36
Here's an idea Google, how about if a site triggers the anti phishing detector of Chrome, it should probably be flagged? Oh but they are a paying customer... I understand.
