Well to expect them to accept Bitcoin and then use them as currency rather than USD would be an awful business decision as the risk outweighs the reward. 
This is how processes develop and this gives me another way to use bitcoin which is good.

I like Chase. I have a CC through them with an interest rate of 8.24% - try to beat that. Plus I can use an ATM for free basically wherever I'm at.

I don't think you understand the civil rights act. This is explicity what it forbids.

I've bought through Coinbase from my chase account at least 30 times and have had no issue.

I've been buying bitcoins for around 15 months. I've spent all of them except $50 I put in cold storage. I like buying stuff with them because they offer me discounts a lot of the time. Plus, everytime I spend them they are worth less the next day anyways.
edit: and that $50 I put in cold storage is worth about $20 now. haha

I'm with you. It's just very easy to use. I have an Italian Exchange student living with me right now and the banks froze her credit card and she had no access to money for a couple weeks. Her mom had to send her a new credit card, through the mail, it took a week and cost her $45 to ship it (she also put in some Baci di Dame cookies for me! my favorite). So in the end it worked out for me but not for my exchange student. Bitcoin is perfect for this situation.

I used Gyft yesterday and it linked my Gyft and Coinbase account and took the funds out when I authorized it. In the past I had to copy and paste the address to send it to, manually enter the amount of BTC to send, and then go back to Gyft and wait for verification. It was simple before but now it's easy. Like 'my parents could do it' easy.

No man, BTC is flawless! /s
@_date: 2015-02-24 16:21:59
What? I authorized them to do it. They aren't just going to pull money out of my account without me authorizing it. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 14:47:34
True story. Goto and if the exchange rate stays the same for 24 hours everyone is posting about how stable the bitcoin economy is then it goes up 10% the next day and down 25% the following.

edit: F U guys for the downvotes. This guy deserves to be trolled. I've been here for a week and have done one BTC transaction and can answer this question. Just look at the last 5,000 posts man. Coinbase is your only way. MtGox, Bitstamp, and BTC-e suck for changing from BTC to USD. But the real answer should be buy something with your BTC since it is a currency and not a stock.

No I think you are missing the point. Your same argument would say inflation creates jobs.

If it was still backed by gold/silver the dollar bill would still say "SILVER CERTIFICATE" rather than "FEDERAL RESERVE NOTE"
@_date: 2013-11-26 15:36:45
His whole argument is based on gold having intrinsic value. You can't use gold for shit. It is a great conductor and can be used on circuit boards but its rarity won't allow that application.

Same at BTC-E. They charge 1 mBTC to transfer Bitcoins to a private wallet.

I have enjoyed my experience with coinbase. I think most people complain out of pure impatience. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 16:37:45
I like this sub. I have learned almost everything I know from here. Sure there is a lot of bad info but most top stories are about the advancement of Bitcoin and some of it is OC
@_date: 2013-11-23 01:07:52
Because when money deflates there is less money in circulation since everyone continues to pay the same interest on debt causing less economic activity. But that is a completely different system than bitcoin which the same coin can't be loaned out over and over.
@_date: 2013-11-23 00:08:28
I have only taken a few economic courses so I can't disagree any further. Common sense tells me you are wrong thats about it.
@_date: 2013-11-25 21:46:00
You are right. I just think it is best to get ahold of your coins and rely on your own security measures.

A lot of things I watch on youtube about bitcoin finds a way back to reddit. It seems to me that Reddit is one of the foundations of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-23 02:38:45
Yes. Banks in the US, by law, have to keep a certain amount in the vaults. Usually 97 percent can be loaned back out. Which then gets put back in the bank by say the car company that someone took a loan out to purchase a car from and loaned out again and again. So a 1,000 savings account actually creates 8,000 in currency all with interest due on every dollar.

Just bought my first bitcoin ever from coinbase today. Do I need to setup a wallet or is that automatically done by coinbase for me? I really like the idea of the paper wallet so am I going to transfer them to that or something. Sorry for the noob question but hopefully someone can help. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 14:59:40
Unless you are holding up a sign on national television, of course.
@_date: 2013-11-22 17:14:13
Just to add to your point; due to deflation companies will have to lower their prices for people to buy things. If Best Buy was selling a 60" flatscreen for 0.90 BTC right now, regardless if I was hoarding, l'm probably going to buy that TV. There is a tipping point.

Note! We've exceeded our normal buy limits for today. If you would still like to purchase you will receive the market price of bitcoin on Friday Nov 22, 2013 at 10:53AM EST after your funds have arrived

The number of coins mined each block is cut in half every four years. Right now it is 25 per block. A block is mined on average every 10 minutes.
@_date: 2013-11-25 20:46:21
When your coins are on coinbase you do not control them until you transfer them to your own wallet. Coinbase stores them in their wallet until you send them to a public address that will be generated in your wallet.
@_date: 2013-11-18 19:45:53
Do you have a link. My work network blocks youtube through reddit
@_date: 2013-12-05 14:38:46
some nice miner will likely eventually put it in a block 
I've never mined but I read that the actual bitcoin software is programmed to give older transactions higher priority as times goes on so that they eventually will have very high priority and obviously be included in a block.
