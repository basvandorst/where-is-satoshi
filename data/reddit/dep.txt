Humanity loves to watch the mighty crash and burn.

Also, I know in moments like these, for a lot of people, the natural instinct is to think that the price will never go up again, but it invariably will.  This isn't a fiat currency we're dealing with here and this isn't something like the real estate market that was the result of mass government neglect. This is simply a bump in the road and heavy volatility as a result of massive volume.

On Friday morning, Trump signed a new tax bill into law, signalling the first major tax overhaul in the U.S. in over 30 years. And while you may or may not have high praise for the bill, one thing is certain: the new tax code is bad news for cryptocurrency investors. Starting Jan. 1st, 2018, all cryptocurrency trades will be a taxable event, including swapping one cryptocurrency for another.

Even if you bought at 19k you haven't technically lost money until you sell. Just ride the storm. Right now it's a theoretical loss. Just ignore it (buy a bit more if you're able but otherwise don't look for a couple months :))

Theoretical losses!  Buying at 19 and selling at 18 is one thing but buying at 19 and selling at 13.5 *two days later* is an emotional decision.

Few things would help for sure. But patience is a virtue.  To think "last week was the highest bitcoin will ever be" seems like a very rash statement.  It's an extremely volatile market. Huge gains, huge losses. Like the sadness that one encounters in life, consider it to be like a storm that you must weather, it will pass.  Without that sadness there can be no happiness.  Lets regroup in a  couple weeks and see where we are then.

It's not even an option when you invest at the top. You have to wait it out. Don't sell at the bottom whatever you do

To keep things in perspective the price of Bitcoin is still up 70% on the month, and 1500% on the year.
