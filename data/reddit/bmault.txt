@_date: 2018-01-30 18:32:49
Cormac McCarthy style
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:17:08

@_date: 2018-01-02 14:41:56
ELI5 re segwit

When does Japan wake up?
@_date: 2018-01-30 14:01:00
Buying opportunity incoming
@_date: 2018-01-30 17:09:46
I gotta step away from checking these prices.  Bought in at 10430 and am already getting nervous.  This is not healthy.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:24:20
what platform (?) di you purchase IOTA on?
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:09:25
where would I start?
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:17:24
again, I am new and not familiar with the technology and terminology, but could you explain your thoughts in simple terms?
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:27:29
thanks brother
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:57:21
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:56:57
I am hearing ETH is the safer, steadier bet for the forseable future
@_date: 2018-05-30 15:05:13
Im at the break even point and I may just cash it out and get back in when (if ) things stabilize.
@_date: 2018-05-03 15:41:35
no I would be managing it but I would like him to be able to see the progress of the price.
@_date: 2018-05-03 15:25:42
cool i'll check
@_date: 2018-05-03 13:31:49
yeah but I am talking $50, not $5000, not sure I need to invest in a hard wallet just yet.
@_date: 2018-05-03 13:19:51
Quick question - how do I open an account for my son?  It would be linked to my bank account.  His 11th birthday is today and I want to set something up so he can follow.
@_date: 2018-05-03 15:00:57
i like that option
@_date: 2018-05-03 13:28:24
can i do coinbase if I already have an account?
@_date: 2018-05-03 13:32:30
Sorry, I have an account on coinbase and gdax, but would like to have a second account to show him how to follow the market.
@_date: 2019-06-23 20:30:47
How do I find my average dollar cost?
@_date: 2019-02-24 16:27:38
Right there with you bro 
@_date: 2019-06-23 21:24:28
I was just curious as I've been buying in small portions over the last two years.  I think u/roganmcn may be right.
EDIT - thanks for the silver!
@_date: 2019-02-13 17:26:33
price still going down
@_date: 2019-02-08 17:55:22
LItecoin FTW
@_date: 2019-06-23 21:27:46
Any easy way to find the amount spent on coinbase?
@_date: 2019-06-23 21:38:10
Problem is I don't know how much I have spent.
@_date: 2019-04-02 14:11:22
that was fun while it lasted
@_date: 2019-04-03 17:00:01

Brings me back to middle school 1988
@_date: 2018-03-05 18:51:32
I would freak if we cracked 12k
@_date: 2018-03-12 15:53:39
HODL tight boys, stay strong
@_date: 2018-02-08 18:38:33

@_date: 2018-11-20 16:54:31

@_date: 2018-03-06 13:59:26
yuge buy wall on gdax
@_date: 2018-02-10 03:33:40
biggest push yet!
@_date: 2018-03-19 17:25:46
Well that was fun while it lasted
@_date: 2018-03-08 19:30:43
Jumped back in at 9,300.  
@_date: 2018-03-18 19:47:33
If you could get out now and maybe make  of your $1000 investment would you?  
@_date: 2018-02-06 13:34:27
stay strong brother
@_date: 2018-02-15 15:16:41
Im just buying and HODLing so in ten years I can cash out and retire.
@_date: 2018-03-06 14:43:18
thanks, 
I guess I have @ 2k spread out over three exchanges so while not life altering if one goes down or gets hacked etc., it is still a decent chunk of change.  I guess I never really considered storing it offline.
@_date: 2019-01-10 19:20:56
Double Doink today
@_date: 2018-02-09 19:04:36
8700 gonna be real tough to crack today
@_date: 2018-02-21 14:50:57
Buying opportunity approaching
@_date: 2018-03-12 11:51:26
Well good morning!
@_date: 2018-02-07 17:23:49
this 8k wall holding on for dear life
@_date: 2018-02-09 17:39:23
getting greedy for second helpings at 8600
@_date: 2018-02-15 14:53:46
10k looking solid for today
@_date: 2018-02-19 18:24:10
Who remembers the battle for 9k?
@_date: 2018-02-20 16:36:34
again, I am not a math person so I am having a hard time wrapping my head around it, but wouldn't owning more bitcoin that was paid for with profits I already made (ie no more money out of pocket) be a wise move?
@_date: 2018-02-09 14:41:45
would love me some 8500 for breakfast
@_date: 2018-02-09 15:18:49
ok maybe brunch
@_date: 2018-02-20 01:01:37
What’s the strategy in this? Thinking about selling some profit I have made in BTC to but more BTC. Does that make sense financially for the long run?
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:20:21
@_date: 2018-11-20 18:11:14
Today has been fun, kind of an old school chaotic day.
@_date: 2018-02-15 15:20:12
That goes with anything.  I am only in  but I love watching it grow.  I am HODLing for the long term so that one day I can say  "told you so"  and buy a Lambo
@_date: 2018-03-06 14:22:03
Quick question...Do you recommned spreading out your money into different exchanges, or keeping your money with one?
@_date: 2018-03-10 17:23:41
9400 tough wall to crack 
@_date: 2018-02-20 19:22:57
That was a fast $100 drop
@_date: 2018-02-20 18:59:54
Thats a fair assesment
@_date: 2018-02-07 13:23:59
Just dipped in again.
@_date: 2018-02-07 13:52:28
Are we stuck at 8500??
@_date: 2018-02-11 18:33:16
I know, I am just as frustrated as anyone else
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:50:56
That 7k wall came down harder than Brandin Cooks
@_date: 2018-02-16 14:38:08
Lets hodl this 10k for a while
@_date: 2018-02-04 03:49:57
@_date: 2018-02-20 16:56:57
i shoudve said that i would reinvest at a lower price.
@_date: 2018-02-20 19:04:47
Yeah, I am in on a few in the hopes that in 5 years I look back and say damn I was smart
@_date: 2018-02-10 01:47:21
Valiant try for 9k
@_date: 2018-03-11 14:26:47
$9400 still tough to crack
@_date: 2018-02-11 14:13:04
How are we going to get to 100k when we can't get to 9k?
@_date: 2017-09-28 00:14:02
yeah, I am new to all this, started purchasing on a whim.  It is like that old rotisiere commercial..."Set it and forget it!"
@_date: 2018-02-20 19:08:03
It looks like theyre all bad.  Im Hodling as I have a few dollars in a bunch and I am just trying to see if they pan out.
@_date: 2018-02-20 16:34:42
got it, thanks!
@_date: 2018-03-07 18:24:44
Please go down so I can buy more 
@_date: 2018-02-20 16:36:47
good point
@_date: 2018-03-12 16:08:17
@_date: 2018-02-06 18:46:03
7k wall all day
@_date: 2018-02-20 17:07:39
This is the answer I was looking for.  I meant to say that I would only buy if it went down.  I forgot that I would be sellin gcoins and not just taking out the profit, thats why I was having a hard time making sense of it.
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:15:45
bought right the the top if this little bump and now it dips right away.
@_date: 2018-02-07 16:35:59
most people are in for the long haul.  I am thinking long term.  yeah it could crash and I'm out of money.  But it could also take off and hit record highs.  If you're scared after it dips 1k, you're in the wrong game.
@_date: 2018-02-06 13:33:44
I think this is the smart move.  People forget what the term investment means.  
@_date: 2018-02-14 12:57:02
newb question... How can I check volume and what is the importance of it?
@_date: 2018-03-16 21:15:45
what happened this morning??
@_date: 2018-02-05 19:39:11
its tough to buy at the very bottom.  Any price right now is a steal!
@_date: 2018-02-14 13:40:55
@_date: 2018-02-07 10:36:31
Hoe you bought the dip boys!
@_date: 2018-02-09 16:53:49
slowly creeping up
@_date: 2018-02-20 16:04:40
quick math question....
(Sorry I am not good with numbers) Let's say I have made a $500 profit with my initial investment.  Am i smart to take some (or all) of that profit and rebuy BTC even though the cost has gone up.  Assume that I want to invest and hodl for the long run.
@_date: 2018-02-09 13:48:02
spend half of your allotment now
@_date: 2018-02-15 15:01:51
not gonna be easy
@_date: 2018-03-20 16:35:54
Thats what she said
@_date: 2018-03-20 16:28:20
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:40:24
7k wall being tested
@_date: 2018-02-12 18:54:05
I like that theory.  Its really all a gamble at this point so why not try to strike gold.
@_date: 2018-02-07 13:55:15
Lets do another $1300! 
@_date: 2019-09-25 23:04:26
party pontoon
@_date: 2018-02-20 19:20:47
Set it and forget it
@_date: 2018-02-09 17:33:58
i would say squeaked through
@_date: 2018-02-11 18:32:57
HODL for life
@_date: 2018-02-14 03:04:27
@_date: 2018-07-23 02:29:35
Lambo by Friday 
@_date: 2018-02-16 15:38:59
already making that sweet money
@_date: 2018-02-03 10:41:11
I see green
@_date: 2018-02-09 19:24:54
that sell wall pushed the price right back
@_date: 2018-02-28 15:37:35
If it goes to 12k I am def hodling for better numbers.
@_date: 2018-02-21 16:37:58
start buying!
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:20:14
no I jumped in at 1050 and was loving it a few days ago.  these are great times to buy
@_date: 2018-02-12 16:58:43
Are alts totoally worthless?  I bouth a bunch of penny ones in that hopes that in ten years they're worth a hell of a lot more.  Its only a couple hundred bucks so I can afford to lose some but they all seem to be tied to BTC
@_date: 2019-09-10 16:13:29
when is the halving?
@_date: 2018-04-26 22:52:58
Up 16% for the month, I’ll take it.
@_date: 2018-04-16 02:15:45
[Going Down]( boys
@_date: 2018-04-03 16:28:27
hang tough $7400
@_date: 2018-04-24 16:33:16
man that is only a few months.  smart move buying more low.  You will be sitting pretty in a year.
@_date: 2018-04-11 14:22:24
The battle for 7k is underway
@_date: 2018-04-24 17:56:38
9400 on GDAX!
@_date: 2018-04-24 16:31:59
I feel like this is how things were supposed to progress.  The huge jump around the holidays was due to FOMO and unsustainable.  This upward trend is more indicitave of the future.  HODL my friend
@_date: 2018-04-24 12:10:22
Shout out to all the HODLers out there.  
@_date: 2018-04-05 15:15:14
holy roly coaster Batman
@_date: 2018-04-13 14:23:30
Almost bought $8220.
@_date: 2018-04-04 13:41:32
Hoping we can rally after that China tariff news.
@_date: 2018-04-24 18:00:36
buying more baby
@_date: 2019-05-30 22:27:57
Coins on sale boys!
@_date: 2019-05-11 22:28:17
converted mine to BC, PIcked it up for $20
@_date: 2019-05-03 12:19:35
This is why we hodl.
@_date: 2018-12-07 18:00:44
I could have written this.  I am in for   came into some money and have been buying for about 14 months.  Not looking for any miracles, but am hoping for a better future.  Best case scenario we are all saying "told you so" in a few years.  Its called an investment for a reason.
@_date: 2019-05-10 19:21:00
I lost  of the value of mine so I am just hodling in the event that years from now I remember them and I have made some sort of profit on them.
