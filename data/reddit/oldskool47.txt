Ha, I was just in Madison for Great Taste of the Midwest. Surely left my btc in cold storage though.  Why the need for anonymity?
@_date: 2016-08-16 12:48:04
It's legit,  I've done exactly what you're trying to do.  But the fees are very high. Why not sign up for Coinbase or Circle or the likes?
@_date: 2015-12-13 21:58:34
Thanks, I appreciate the link. Is there a way to link my Shift card to my Coinbase report? So if I buy btc on Coinbase, spend it via my Shift card, would it calculate the profit/loss automatically? Completely understand that you can't give advice. Just want to make sure my experience is as seamless as possible. Cheers!
@_date: 2015-12-11 22:06:46
I signed up for the card, but I also hesitate to use it due to the tax troubles. Is Coinbase working on integrating this?
@_date: 2015-12-11 16:35:08
This is an INTELLIGENT bank! Bravo, Privatbank. Can't wait to see where this leads!

Do you NOT have anything better to post?
@_date: 2014-03-12 15:15:05
Holy crap, how can they protect themselves? So I can basically protect my investment buy purchasing an out-of-stock item.. BTC price drops.. and they'll give me back the original amount? I can't imagine that'll serve them well going forward, but I'm glad to see they're offering options. Good business.
@_date: 2014-03-29 18:31:51
Happened to me, except there was a message saying they had made a duplicate deposit. I contacted them and they looked into it. You can (and should) email them or click the chat button in the bottom right of the website. Support -- why you aren't moving your coins to your wallet once they arrive is beyond me.  Good luck.
@_date: 2014-03-14 17:02:08
Excellent! Did you purchase with BTC?

Litecoin 
@_date: 2014-03-18 12:15:35
Btc whales exchanging for litecoin. Huobi in China is allowing litecoin exchanges any hour now. Not too late to jump ship
@_date: 2014-03-08 23:27:13
I've been more than satisfied with Coinbase. Good customer service as well. It could go down more, I'm waiting until Monday to see what Russia does. Cyprus as an Bitcoin hub is not near fruition.

Tell them to get their heads out of their arses and get with the program.. or be left in the dust. Believe it or not, we actually need their support. Git 'R dun!
@_date: 2014-03-20 18:05:51
Focus on your business, and if the right opportunity comes, jump on it. Coinbase just made 2 high profile hires, don't take offense to being turned away.
@_date: 2014-03-18 12:12:26
What if btc crashes and ltc takes its place?

Good point, there are lots of rich folks in the Phils. Thanks for your response. Yes, Western Union is horrible and Paypal is pretty bad too with currency conversion 2.5% on top of 4% international fees..

Enough said, Coinbase FTW!

Rule  always send Paypal payments via "Gift" payment where you have absolutely no recourse. JOKES.

Why would they do it quietly? Overstock raked in $100k in BTC orders their first day accepting it. No way they could have been hush-hush and been as successful. I'd bet the Papa John's guy would be more interested
@_date: 2014-03-12 18:41:59
Coinbase is your best option. Really happy with their services. Recommended highly
@_date: 2014-03-12 14:49:28
Cool, thanks for that. I think we're going to do an in-person purchase first. Can't be too safe anymore

They're notoriously higher but I'll take it for the safety and security
@_date: 2014-03-08 22:07:30
It's not hard to implement and low cost. If you're knowledgeable on Bitcoin, present the facts and hope for the best. Our company is in the process of accepting bitcoin at the moment. Our web guy set it up overnight. 
@_date: 2014-03-18 12:35:05

I'm in the US so I can't help, sorry. Remember the old saying, "Only invest what you can afford to lose 100%". Good luck mate
@_date: 2014-03-12 01:17:46
I saw them when I did a simple Google query. It says they sell BTC locally so maybe that's the best bet. There's a lot of corruption over there so we want to be extra careful. Thanks
@_date: 2014-03-12 18:45:15
Google is actually pro bitcoin. They're working on integrating BTC within their Google Payments system. Don't believe everything you read in the media. Where there's money to be made, Google will be one of the first in line.

My point is that no US Gov't agency considers bitcoin money.

* Buyer and seller agree to purchase price
* Buyer sends funds via Paypal
* Seller sends bitcoin
* Buyer waits, then files dispute up to 180 days later
* Paypal investigates
* Paypal refunds buyer
* Buyer has their money and your bitcoin

Coinbase allows instant purchases with a linked bank account and credit card. If your bank account transfer fails, however, your card will be charged ~2.96% in additional fees.

That didn't take long to reach reasonable prices. Currently $271.50 / btc

Seems to me that paypal is serious about bitcoin integration. Perhaps they're planning a paypalcoin.  I don't see why else they'd bring him on board.

Paypal is already testing the waters with Braintree. Being that they're "sister companies", if Paypal has continued success, I'm sure eBay will follow suit.

Good point. If the Rakuten US plan goes well, I could see them adding bitcoin to Viber at some point.
