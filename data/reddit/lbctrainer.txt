So should I buy Bitcoin now or on the 26th when it shorts?

Quantstamp is a very undervalued coin that has an incredible utility- it is the "brinks security" of smart contracts and ideally will be the industry standard to ensure that smart contracts do not have any flaws in their codes that leave them venerable to hacks or attacks, etc. I am particularly impressed with QSP because I haven't really come across something like it in the crypto space so it is one of a kind in my opinion.

That’s the funniest crap I’ve seen on Reddit ��

This is the absolute most ignorant title and post that I've ever had the displeasure of reading on Reddit. Delete this and get a clue

I'm of the mindset of "who cares?" Let them buy crypto provided that they pay their balance every month (in an ideal situation). It takes days for the bank to debit the money and credit is instant so I get it...I also get the bank's stance but what's the point of credit if you can't use it how you want? Might as well just use my debit card and be interest free on transactions

That is a fair assessment, still a really good opportunity to invest!

Probably won’t go green across the board until March. Seems to be the yearly trend.

We all know why they are banning transactions but what is their “reasoning” for doing so? If you are a responsible card holder, why are you forbidden from buying crypto?

I definitely understand that but let's be honest, I could use my credit card(s) towards an expensive wedding, honeymoon and lavish trips first class and not pay a dime. A lot of people use credit cards just not to pay it and still end up with decent enough credit to rinse and repeat the cycle with other credit companies. All I am saying is that it is unfair to penalize those investing in crypto because one is making the assumption that we are not sophisticated investors. The conspiracy theorist in me believes that they don't want "retail investors" (normal people) to get in on crypto that could disrupt the industry and put people in a great financial position to not work dead end jobs (I.e. 9 to 5s and corporate jobs with glass ceilings) messing up the status quo of society. The elite want to be the elite and want to control money. Much easier to control the money by placing barriers of entry. Sorry for the rant lol

I hope it goes down too! Great time to buy and HODL for life

Correction soon or nah?

I'm really sick of institutional people calling retail investors stupid. That's how they perceived normal people, like us, and their elitism is showing.

Great post! I've been thinking of Bitcoin futures now and how folks can best protect their interests. Do you know when the next contract is set to expire or what price? Basically I'm wondering what the bottom will be before a massive bullrush. I don't have any Bitcoin but I've been patiently waiting for an in since getting into crypto

Then why are they trying to establish a trading desk? FUD
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:00:44
One can dream! lol
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:01:07
Please for goodness sakes HODL onto your coins. Why would you sell especially for a loss? It will recover so relax lol
*Edit I just read the last sentence....$13 bucks?
