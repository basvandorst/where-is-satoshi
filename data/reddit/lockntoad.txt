How about you get Bitcoiners to pay for stuff with Bitcoin in the first place? Everyone is "hodling" and expects others to spend their coins. But in the meantime demand all kinds of shit from processors and merchants.

"Subtle clues". Get a grip man. 
@_date: 2015-04-07 08:08:16
Sure. Nobody cares about the price here. Absolutely not interesting. 
Aaaaand downvoted. Hilarious. 
@_date: 2015-04-06 14:12:29
Because everyone who doesn't share your ridiculous point of view is a troll right?
@_date: 2015-04-06 17:13:17
Everyone understands your post. Because we have seen the same kind of posts almost daily for 2 years or longer now. 
And every time it's the same: Bitcoiners keep on harrassing a merchant till he accepts Bitcoin. Finally he puts it on his site. 1 person uses it in 6 months. Merchant removes it. Bitcoiners get angry, attack his business and blame the owner.

Coming from someone who wants stuff he doesn't like downvoted. Think about that for a minute and realize how truly childish that is. 
@_date: 2015-04-06 19:31:24
He makes a lot of sense and calling him a troll because you don't like what he says is just so pathetic. 
@_date: 2015-04-07 00:56:53
The cult surrounding it. 
@_date: 2015-04-06 16:17:36
As i said before: get a grip. 
You sound like a lunatic conspiracy theorist. 
@_date: 2015-04-06 22:10:52
Why would you waste your time on that?
@_date: 2015-04-07 07:26:36
These people are not early adopters. Early adopters have cashed out long time ago. 
@_date: 2015-04-06 16:50:26
Please just stop. 
@_date: 2015-04-06 17:55:37
So now you're also telling me what sites i am allowed to visit. You have some serious issues, kiddo. 
@_date: 2015-04-06 17:24:00
If you post crazy conspiracy theories i will call you a crazy conspiracy theorist. If you don't like that you might want to avoid public forums.

I didn't watch the video but i assume your claim is there are paid government shills in this sub. 
Ok, i want to believe you. Can you please point out one paid government or banker shill here?
Downvoted because?
@_date: 2015-04-06 16:29:39
No, this is not a chicken and egg problem. Bitcoiners want merchants to accept Bitcoin just to pump the price. 
Yet they will "hodl" and expect others to buy something. 
What's even worse is that these same people tend to get agressive and will attack a business if they refuse to put up a Bitcoin payment option. 
There is simply no chicken and egg in this scenario.

Why are you asking us? You speak German so why won't you tell us?
@_date: 2015-04-08 16:20:51
Because nobody pays with it. 
The same reason they don't accept zimbabwean dollars. 
Yes, just downvote it and it will go away. 
@_date: 2015-04-06 22:57:59
Just don't use the search. You'd find 30 topics with exactly the same question. That got answered. Now we wouldn't want that, would we?
@_date: 2015-04-08 17:54:41
Why do you hate the free market?
@_date: 2015-04-07 16:58:28
Take a guess why.
