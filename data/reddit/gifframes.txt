That only really works if youre above 50%. Anything below and you risk loosing all your work, because the official chain becomes longer than your secret one.  
There's another attack where you just mine one block yourself and only broadcast it, once you know about the official block, in hope your broadcast is 'faster'. (maybe this can work by having your own little, global network with very low pings so you'll be able to spread your block faster. Also maybe one would have 'spy' points close to the other pools, to quickly notice once they broadcast their own.
@_date: 2014-05-29 07:45:41
anyone capable of giving you an altered .exe can also give you an altered checksum. So you're not really checking anything then

You can only win with this strategy if you have &gt; 50% . Else it's just gambling. And having &gt; 50% you could do way worse than that attack.  
For you having two blocks so you wouldn't waste a block you already would have had to gamble.

I'm not saying there's a better solution (other than people not being idiots), but calling the guy 'good' is just wrong in my opinion. He might be better than the ones stealing them and ignoring the occasional reddit posts, but that's about it (still far from being good).

Many attacks per second can start warming up cold wallets. At about 150 kAttacks/s, cold wallets will reach critical temperature, transforming them into hot wallets. After that you can start leeching at about 4.5 trillion satoshi/s, until the now hot wallet is fully emptied.   
 
About 2 hours after the attack, the hot wallet will have cooled down, being a cold wallet again. It might be secure again now, but rather empty.   
The problem with MtGox was that their ventilation system is top of the notch, resulting in that attack occuring unnoticed.

You 'hiding' your blocks puts you at risk of them becoming too old. And as long as you're below 50% you'll always lose like that.  
And if your chance of finding the next block is 40%, then your chance of finding the two next blocks is only 16%

Also it's not about me not trusting you. It's about educating fellow bitcoiners about these things.  
Having BTC makes you one of the most profitable hack-targets. So especially when downloading software for bitcoin people should be super careful.  
And an open-source project which runs a .exe isn't open source.  
It's just wrong to promote the trustless BTC protocol and then just download .exe files of because he's a cool guy.  
Even if you haven't put anything in there, the entire positive feedback here and people blindly downloading it might attract someone else who's not as nice as you.  
So to educate the community you SHOULD remove the .exe, and explain why you did so (on the project's page), so that people see the risk in it and might learn something

@_date: 2013-11-07 10:40:20
You won't be able to tell how many BTC are on the wallet right now without access to the internet/blockchain.  
Depending on the client it can happen that you generate a new adress as soon as you send BTC to someone where you send your change to. You have to be careful there in case your client does that and you don't back up the newly generated adress of you.  
If you had 2 BTC and spent 1, and later want so spend another 2 BTC from that adress since you forgot how many you still had there that transaction will just not work.  
With the cold storage clients your online PC will keep track of your adresses and the number of BTC on them but won't have the private key and therefore be unable to spend any.
@_date: 2013-07-02 15:43:37

walltes pretty much just contain your adresses and your keys for those adresses to sign transactions.  
Anyone who knows the keys can spend your BTC.  
If you print them on paper anyone who finds it can spend it.  
If your paper-wallets catch fire, you're poor.  
What you do: downloiad encryption software like "truecrypt" take your wallet containing the keys to sign transactions and encrypt them with a very long password you neither should write down nor you should forget.  
Now only people with access to that file and knowledge of the password can spend your BTC.  
Now you take the file and spread it like crazy, so it becomes rather impossible that all copies get destroyed.
