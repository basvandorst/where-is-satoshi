Posts like “coffee shop accepts bitcoin” make me feel like BTC has a ton of headroom left. 
I’m looking forward to the day we are reading posts that say “BTC” now dominant currency in Venezuela. Hope I can DCA my way to one coin before that day. 
Thanks for the update!

We hope it is the start of a snowball that will become an avalanche.

We pretend to work and they pretend to pay. Economics is about incentivizing production. Take away the incentive and you take away the production.

CIA fact book says there is $55 trillion in currency in circulation including no printed money such as savings and checking accounts. $55T/22M BTC = $2.5M. 
That assumes all currency is converted to BTC which isn’t likely. Assuming the world becomes wealthier through globalization and improvements in productivity the $55T might double in 20 years. 
Assuming a doubling of world capital and only a quarter of that wealth being stored in BTC that would yield a value $5M/BTC. 
Assuming a 10% chance that I’m correct, the current value of a BTC should be $500k. $5Mx10%chance of success = value of bet.

I agree they are really easy to work with. If I make a bunch of money when I sell, I’ll pay taxes on the profit regardless. So I don’t really care that they report to the IRS.

Only to be an engineer. There are many non engineering roles. Estimator, scheduler, superintendent, project manager, BIM engineer, the list keeps going on.

Good. More time to buy at below $10k. I hope it’ll hold for another year. I see $100k as just a matter of time.

I tried to time the market and kept getting frustrated. Just set up an automatic buy for whatever amount you can afford each week. Don’t plan on selling for ten plus years. 
To be honest I’m hoping the market will go down again. My goal is to have at least one BTC and that will be tough if it goes to $100k.

Potentially for the last time as well. 3, 2, 1 we have ignition.

My big hope is for 3rd world countries to abandon their fiat before it abandons them again.  I think it will be a bottom up movement.

I don’t really know much about crypto. I just buy $50/week in btc and plan to hold for 20 years or until the price becomes stable. I believe it will eventually become the worlds reserve currency. 
It’s seems like stablecoin is prone to all the same problems as fiat. Why do you think developing countries would prefer stablecoin? It seems like a stable coin like Gemini will eventually pull some BS and loose everyone’s money. I would think that would send most other stable coin holders over to BTC. Since regulation and centralization inevitably cause problems. 
I’m interested to know what others think on this subject.

Get into commercial construction. There are so many $100k jobs out there! Our industry is starved of talent and has tremendous demand. Also it’s a lot of fun. Everyone likes to see things being built. It’s a very positive industry.

Rise Sir HODL

I feel the same way. I’m gonna just start putting in $25 a week or so since that’s about all I’m willing to risk.

Thanks for the info. I was referring to the Gemini Dollar which is backed by the Gemini Exchange. I believe Tether is pretty similar to GUSD.
