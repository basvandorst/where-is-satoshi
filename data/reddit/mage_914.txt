You're right I just did the math. Using one of those mining apps you could only make 0.0025 bitcoin every 55 days if it was running 24/7. The ETH one was a lot better at about 0.045 ETH in about 10 days but that's still kinda crappy.

Its not like I dropped my whole savings into bitcoin or anything. People just keep talking about how bitcoin is so "volatile" and the minute I decide to chip in a hundred bucks the price immediately goes down so I kind of panicked.

Damn I was scare there. I just bought my first Bitcoin at around 17,600 like a week ago and I was freaking out because afterwards the price immediately dipped and stayed there. I felt like a serious fuck up.

I was getting about 0.000004 ETH per minute. Doing my math again its more like one 0.045 ETH payout every 8 days or so.
Edit: BTW I just pick one out of the app store. No clue if its legit or not. I just wanted to see what rate it was mining at.

I like how this almost sounds like a religious debate. "No our bitcoin is real and yours is made up. Praise Satoshi!"

Honestly Government controls whatever the fuck it wants. Even if you stuck directly to the Dark Web the feds still know like 90% of what goes on down there because they monitor it and the only reason they don't bust every illegal sale is because its not worth it. 
Its like how the IRS isn't auditing every waitress who fails to report her tips. There's too many offenders to make cleaning them all up even remotely worth it. If something changed their mind however, it would only be a matter of time before the snagged an admin account from some asshole who uses "password123" as his login and then log the IPs of everyone they can. 
They've done so many times before. Silk Road has been taken down half a dozen times. Just a few years ago they had a sting operation where the FBI took over and ran a CP site to catch hundreds of child molesters. They then let all of them go because if it went to trial they would have had to explain in court the specifics of how they were gaining access to these sites and they didn't want to do that.
The only way to oppose the government is to be a bigger government.
