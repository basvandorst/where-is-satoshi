We have been in operation since 2011, and are already aware of the credit card fraud use for package forwarding and do not tolerate this use of fraud.

Cost to receive a letter is $0.95.
Say we recieve 10 letters for your account, the cost would be $9.50.
Cost to forward a shipment is $4.95 + shipping (flat rate envelope ~$5.00)
This would be the only charges for your account. You can schedule a shipment at any time, and select the letters you want us to forward. We do not have a weekly, or monthly auto mailout feature at this time, but it is on our list to implement soon. Will need to have a deposit feature first before implementing this.

We never open packages, and we don't steal mail.
Edit: We will open packages out of their shipping boxes if a client requests package consolidation with removal of outside shipping boxes.

- In the comparison chart, that is other companies we are comparing ourselves too.
- We do handle these types of items, right now they are treated the same way as packages. This fee will be lowered to a $0.95/letter receiving fee.
- Consolidation services can save you money, because we will take multiple boxes, and place them into one large box. By destroying the outside shipping boxes, and placing into one box. 
- I am not sure where you found the /features.php link, can you tell us more so we can fix this.
- Jobs link is there, as this week we will be posting for applications for new hires this week.
- fee calculator is not working for USA if this is what you were testing. We are working to complete this.
We just launched with this new website design last week, so there is still some bugs. We hope to have these all worked out shortly, and thanks for the heads up.

Package &amp; Mail Forwarding companies are a dime a dozen. We strive to be the best out there, but we must face it, most companies are a lot larger than us.
Our warehouse costs are low, very low, and so is our overhead. We pass those saving onto you, our customer. We have fought really hard to provide highly discounts shipping rates and charges.
We have a lot of new features to release over the next few months, and we think our customers will love them.

Before freevirtualmailbox.com we opperated out of a FedEx Authorised Shipping Outlet called Ship Shipping, providing virtual mailboxes and private mailboxs in Shippensburg PA. We then launched the online website in December of 2012. You can still see our old listing on my old companys website

We are here to provide a legal use for package forwarding, and shopping in the USA, with acceptance of bitcoin. We follow federal rules and regulations. If a federal agent comes to us with a search warrant for a package, or for information. Were going to have to give it to them. We do not assist drug dealers with their illegal uses. But, we are here for the anonymity of our customers, and do not open package that we receive. We want to forward your packages, to make a profit. We want your continued business, we dont want a hitman from killing our CEO.
