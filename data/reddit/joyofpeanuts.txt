I agree with the short-term effect, but not long-term, not in a context of high asset prices and low interest rates.
Remember the subprimes crisis when  interest rates increased and housing collapsed? Sure, we are not in exactly the same situation, but there are some elements of similarity and concern here.

I wish I was in your fortunate dilemma :)
First: if you have just over 21 BTC, you are not yet in the fully-life changing league. I think that currently you are there if you have the equivalent of 2 million USD or +/-100 BTC. With 21 or slightly more, you are in the league of "a very good start in life".
Is you purpose in life to become very rich, or to be debt-free and risk-free for the rest of your life?
If the first gets your preference, then I suppose that you should hold, although there is still that non-null risk that the crypto economy collapses - even though the blockchain technology in itself is there to stay. Then I suggest to diversify your holdings a bit in the top 10 (non-premined) cryptos.
If you rather prefer scenario 2, then maybe do +/- as you suggest: (1) buy a flat or better still a house to have a home of your own, be essentially bank-free and never ever risk becoming homeless (2) sell some into cash to cover say 6 months of income, or convert some on a monthly rate back to fiat as a sort of steady revenue in case shit happens and (3) keep the rest and hope it does 10x for your children and grandchildren.
In the end, your call. At the current rate of growth, the choice gets easier to answer by the day :)

At the current pace of growth of bitcoin adoption, the doubling enabled by segwit buys too little time.
But it is a necessary and worthwhile step that will eventually enable us to process 1,000x or maybe 1,000,000x more transactions per minute.
Because if you are Core and look at the long-term goal of replacing fiat currencies, visa, mastercard, etc. at a lower cost, that is what you end goal is and what you plan your technical roadmap against.

In the end, fundamentally, the value of money, of a currency, depends on the number of its users. The more users, the more value. And the limited supply of BTC makes it predictable because no one can just "print" some to dilute value. That is the main thing I understood when I read the white paper and saw the popularity. Every time you see a figure that hundreds of thousands of people joined Coinbase, Kraken,... in a week, expect a value increase.

It will depend on the magnitude of the crisis:

As far as I remember, the US is one of the few countries that taxes it's nationals' revenue based on their nationality, and not on their country of residence.
Meaning US citizens pay taxes to the IRS wherever they live in the world.
What the US would not accept other countries doing... (example: Bulgaria saying Bulgarian residents pay all their revenue taxes to Bulgaria even if they live in the US...).
Many tax agreements deal with this to avoid double taxation.
So I guess you have to pay... but take professional advice somewhere.

Economically, they have built a sort of parasitic subsidisation system at the expense of all other coins, but especially bitcoin.
Here is how it goes :
1) BTC up increases profitability on the BTC chain.
2) Hashing moves away from BCH to BTC.
3) BCH hashing difficulty drops to adjust up profitability on that chain.
4) Hashing moves back from BTC to BCH.
5) Go back to step 1.
I use BTC in the above 5 steps but the relationship is actually to some extent to the whole cryptocoin ecosystem.
Eventually, while I support the freedom to fork, define one's own technical route and take chances with one's own vision of a better chain, a fundamental element of one's technology should not be a link - be it via market adjustments - to the very cryptocoin one tries to distinguish oneself from.
That said, BCH's EDA can't be its sole reason to exist; it will have to build its own real-life uses and have value for its own merits not to disappear while BTC and other cryptocoins keep innovating, build technical bridges betwwen themselves and integrate constructively in a new economlic system.

What the article fails to see, is that this is not much different from the difference between printing technology and USD banknotes.
Anyone can create it's own currency and print banknotes, but it is the scale and trust that create the value.
Bitcoin has its first mover advantage and this belief/trust in its future.
In short, bitcoin is indeed a self-fulfilling prophecy, and that is why it will succeed.

One side benefit is that it could deflate the argument of Bitcoin Cash that they are better with their "bigger block".
That argument would be pretty much empty if bitcoin would have segwit + 2MB blocks.
Up to core developers, and users by selecting their node, to see if - assuming first a well-tested technology - considering future transaction volume needs and the possibility of consolidating the community is worth the move now.

OK, your description illustrates the fractional reserve mechanism applied to bitcoin.
I still think that there is a difference between fiat and bitcoin in terms of what is actually spendable.
In your example, how much can be spent by the original lender to the bank and the company that put money in the same bank?
With fiat, both can spend the money they have in the bank, just creating a problem for the bank that is not respecting its fractional reserve ratio.
With bitcoin, because eventually you can only ever spent amount controlled by a private key, at most the original 1 bitcoin can be spent.
Imagine that the original lender and the company want to spend respectively 0.4 and 0.8 of their money. With fiat they can thought accounting debt/credit writings. With bitcoin they can't both, because the bank's wallet keys only ever control 1 bitcoin at most.
@_date: 2018-06-16 15:56:31
I think you got fractional reserve wrong:
When I would deposit 1 bitcoin in bank, they just offer a custodial service and effectively control it, but there is still only ever 1 bitcoin. If they lend 0.5 bitcoin and keep the other 0.5, they control 0.5 and the borrower 0.5; still 1 bitcoin in total. All I have would have is some promise that they will return the money at some point with interest.
Fractional reserve is a different beast: when I put 1 USD in the bank, they can lend 50 USD based on a 2:100 fraction basis (if my memory is correct). There are some great videos showing how the accounting of this works with fiat. This is impossible with bitcoin because there is no authority nor possibility (by protocol design) to create extra units by anyone.

Not sure it would be as easy as with fiat. How do you issue a loan in excess of deposits when you have a system with an absolute fixed money supply and no "trusted" central authority?
Some probable issues:
1) You cannot lend bitcoins if you do not have them. The lender simply has no bitcoins to lend and cannot record a transfer in excess of what he has in his wallet.
2) From another angle, how to pay back loans in excess of the actual amount in circulation and available to pay back such loans.
3) There is no authority that can control the fraction applied: 100:1, 1000:1, ... ? So such a system would fail to build consensus about the acceptable fraction on top of the trustless bitcoin protocol.
4) If it is somehow implemented as a fiat bitcoin backed by real bitcoin, the value of the fiat bitcoin will deflate to match the artificially inflated availability. Pointless.

There are 2 topics here: the role of money and its allocation.
Contrary to what many think, money's economic purpose IS NOT to reward work or innovation. Money's economic purpose IS to facilitate exchanges.
Economically, it does not really matter if a billionaire or one broke redneck spends money, as both will make the economy work, be it for different goods.
Still, how you allocate the money will have an effect on how much is spent: the more you have, the more you can afford to spare, making it useless to the system.
In the end, money is there to make the economy work and wealth distribution is "just" a political and social fairness question.
There are some other cryptocoins that address this with constant generation/no cap or things that resemble universal allocation.

This is the kind of questions that get easier to answer for yourself the longer you have been married. When you have not been married for long, well, divorces happen between ones whom you thought were made for a life-long marriage.
So my 2 satoshis:
1) Check your wedding contract, if any, or the default wedding arrangement applicable in your state or country.
2) You seem to have acquired your coins before the wedding, so they are yours anyhow, I think.
3) Tell her, not like you had hidden it from her, but like you had kept it secret to make a big surprise.
4) Buy the house, under your name, and agree with her that you can reinvest the money you would have put in the loan in crypto.
5) Tell her that you should both keep working until your stash of crypto has at least doubled and you can live a life where you do what you want.
6) And let her change job. No point spending half your life doing something that you don't like.
Thanks for your story. Enjoy life not the money.
IANAL, so all up to you in the end.
EDIT: It is a bit sad to see so many comments telling you to be defiant of your wife and to prepare for divorce war. Hiding and lying is more likely to precipitate a divorce than telling and enjoying.
EDIT2: Just imagine that the reason why she really wants to quit her job is because she has 500 BTC and has not told you yet :). BTW, that's a good tip: How would you like her to act if she had lots of BTC?

Your freedom, your choice.
And in the cryptoworld there is much more to chose from than BTC, BCH, B2X.
At this stage of development of this new financial system, *no one* can predict what cryptocoin will be the leader in 5, 10 or 20 years.
BTC has the benefit of having been there first, and that was sufficient in other industries to become the solution of choice.
But at this stage I suggest that a bit of diversification between a few cryptocoins is wise. Pick the ones with a solid technical basis, ethical attitude to users and good reason to exist.

That's not exactly what he says. What he says is that the "anonymity of bitcoin transactions" make it likely that governments will want to regulate bitcoin and that this can "put pressure on bitcoin".
I say: good luck controlling a global P2P network that can run though VPN pipes, over Tor or even via hand-to-hand exchanges. Also further development can develop even more the anonymity and "stealthiness" of bitcoin, and there are actually existing coins like Zcash or Monero that have already pushed anonymity that step further.
The technology is out, it cannot be put back in a cage (I hope).
Interestingly he more generally sees future in what he insists to call "distributed ledger technology".

Indeed. And on top Bitfinex is systematically 4-6% higher in its USD/BTC rate than other exchanges such as Bitstamp or BTC-e, let alone OKCoin.
@_date: 2017-04-22 18:51:37
This is indeed extremely worrying and to me hints that the Bitfinex inflated price bubble is about to explode - geyser-style.
The issue is plainly that the BTC/USD rate on Bitfinex is meaningless as you cannot redeem your coins for fiat USD.
IMHO; Bitfinex USD holders have no choice but to buy BTC because that is the only way out: to another exchange or better still to a private wallet e.g. So actually the increase of the price on Bitfinex does not represent a trust in the BTC value there but exactly the contrary !
And the correction down will exceed the 100$ gap: sub-1000$ values possible.
@_date: 2017-04-11 13:16:42
It will get really interesting and messy when customers of other exchanges realize that there is a bit of a bubble here and that it is about to burst.
These customers will sell their Bitcoins for EUR or USD with no problem. This will send prices down.
Then the Bitfinex customers will realize they are blocked, panick and send very negative messages around. And the bubble will burst.
The Bitcoin is strong and will become mainstream I am sure. But we will have here another episode of its turbulent youth.
Sell now and prepare to buy back in a few weeks...

It is IMHO.
Bitcoin + LN will lead to more adoption. More adoption will lead to more users (companies and individuals) and contribute to the network effect =&gt; price up.
A rule of thumb is that the value evolves as the square of the size of the network.
The value of bitcoin does not have to be only as a reserve of value. Actually quite the contrary: with LN bitcoin gets a boost towards being a medium of exchange, as was the intention all along. If bitcoin becomes both a reserve and a medium of exchange, like the USD or EUR say, this is great.

Short-term, there is a negative trend fueled by a vicious circle of self-sustaining negative sentiments, supported by bear whales manipulating the market to milk the less informed.
There are many reasons why BTC is worth much more than 7000$. In short: next to its scarcity and value as a reserve value, the value of BTC is determined by expectations about it's future uses and value. There is ample information available around on the net about this.
That said, if you have BTC and reeeally believe it's worth only 20 USD, I'll buy some from you at that price.

There has been over-enthusiasm and FOMO around December. That bubble popped. The market being volatile and with many manipulative speculators, I could not tell what the exact objective real value should be. Somewhere between 1,000 and 1,000,000 USD I would say :)
But considering all the good news (Lightning Network and other technical advances, governments wanting to regulate but not deter crypto, more channels to use crypto for direct payment, companies accepting it for mayment), that real value is increasing.

The article is a bit short of analysis of reasons why Amazon may want or need to accept cryptocurrencies.
First: competion. Amazon may be forced to by competition: if a competitor, large such as Alibaba, or a smaller challenger, embraces bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies, Amazon may have to play "me-too". Will Amazon be first, or risk be second?
Second: Technology. The objection about the number of transactions looses weight considering the fast development of the Lightning Network. When ready and scaled-up in production, I could very well see Amazon being a sort of LN hub, with channels open to its customers but also to its many partners suppliers in the market place. Imagine the speed and ease of such transactions.
Third: Tier 2 payment solutions. It may be that Amazon does not enable payments in crypto directly, but consumers may get the possibility to pay based on crypto anyway thanks to payment solutions backed to crypto in development (Litepay springs to my mind but there are other for bitcoin of course). Thereby Amazon gets it fiat cash, but you eventually pay in crypto. Pretty much like paying with a foreign currency, except the fee should be lower. I would think that Amazon will rather prefer to control the payment stream from A to Z, rather than leave it up to a separate company.
So, we will be able to pay Amazon purchases in bitcoin or other cryptocurrency, one way or the other.
@_date: 2018-03-18 12:32:29
The Lightning Network has been just a few weeks in production; let's give it a bit more time shall we? The Internet was not built overnight either.
 
To me LN is not a temporary solution. It is more like FTP (file transfer), SMTP (mail), HTTP (web) being built on top of TCP-IP.
The Roman dinari anecdote was meant to be just that, an anecdote. There are more examples of old currency or payment systems that never fully die off.
If your bank gets robbed, the cost of it is simply mutualized through the cost of police, private security, insurance, spread over all customers of the bank. When the loss is too band, banks go broke and then you are screwed. Sometimes the bank gets bailed out and the cost is mutualized, eventually shared via taxes or lesser social benefits to all citizens. When the Fed prints money, you are screwed. When the state seizes money, you are screwed.
I am not saying that fiat money and the current system is all bad nor unsafe, otherwise it would not have existed so long. Nor that cryptocurrencies are fully ready for prime time. But eventually they give the possibility that YOU control YOUR money.

The Lightning Network is a second layer protocol. The fees on the base layer will be what they are, but many more transactions can be settled off-chain on the LN layer, not requiring miners to verify those transactions.
Basically LN potentially takes a large share of the verification process out of the hands of miners: they only validate the balance of a number of transactions when the LN channel is closed.
So miners have no incentive in LN deploying, but they can do nothing about it directly.
@_date: 2018-03-18 07:14:36
You totally miss the point of why it will go up: long-term market and technical F.U.N.D.A.M.E.N.T.A.L.S beat short-term sentiments.
2 examples:
1) More governments are regulating crypto: not saying it should be banned but saying that abuses should be prevented but more important that they should not miss the boat.
2) Lightning Network now in production / main net: do you realize how a breakthrough this is??? It brings several orders of magnitude speed improvement AND much lower costs AND further decentralization AND the possibility of direct swaps with other coins.

Very likely above 10,000. Some say up to 1,000,000.
I think that we will hit 10,000 before year end. So if you can hold to your Bitcoins to year end you could have your cake AND eat it: 1.5 BTC that you sell to cover needs and 1.5 BTC that at year end will be worth as much as the current 3.
But try to hold the 3.

Up for discussion with tax authorities... I guess that if you hodl most for over a year it is OK. So it should also be OK if you buy/sell a minor part shorter term and you say this is to manage some risk.
Basically it is the same that would apply to stock trading.
@_date: 2018-02-01 12:41:01
At some point BTC dropped more than 30% and I panicked and sold - 10$ above the bottom - and BTC shot up within days to double the value at which point I bought back. Now I stay and HODL no matter what because I believe in the fundamentals.
If the technology is good and the trend is up long-term, it is much safer and less stressful to HODL - even if it is funnier in a bullish phase.
@_date: 2017-09-14 22:42:22
There is indeed a lot of cash around following profit taking (and some  panic selling) the last days.
A big share of the crypto market is illiquid: hodlers for sure, all the relatively early investors, and probably a fair share of the people who bought high and wait for the recovery.
See that anyone who invested before September 1st, and certainly before May 1st, is happily waiting or jumping back in if he sold in the last days.
So, yes, there is a big share of the market that is not selling nor buying for the time being, what amplifies the volatility.
My guess - like the post author's - is that are getting very close to the bottom of that volatility range and should see some very nice movement up. Maybe within 24 hours.

Maybe you invested more than you could afford and feel bad now, but it is inevitable that the value of bitcoin will bounce back-up to and above the last ATH. This has happened before and is just one more episode.
Maybe take a break from your computer and smartphone and go some nice place, call people you know and have a chat, or a special support line if you feel really that much down, visit something you always wanted to visit but never took time for...
The world is big and full of nice people, see, meet and enjoy all of it.

Not my point: the S&amp;D determines the price, but what I mean is that the transaction is just a change of hands.
You have 5 cononuts. You sell me 2. You have 3 coconuts and I have 2.
Whatever the price my point is that all the bitcoins end in some pockets and maybe these are the smart ones, the whales, the big guys.

BTC + Lightning Network is ...well... Lightning Fast: seconds


This is just slowing down, a temporary setback. Unstoppable means exactly that: cannot crawl to a full halt and disappear. And it will accelerate again after all the current FUD exhausts itself.
Anecdotally, someone (Nick Szabo maybe?) reminded recently that no currency ever looses its full value. The anecdote was that you can still find antique Roman Dinari, and they still have value - for scarcity, as a store of value in antiques, etc.


I was referring to the decentralization of the technology, not the distribution of money. About the Chinese megafarms, it is one of these cases where they have facial power but will loose it if they attenpt to exercise it. (1) They tried to enforce S2X and fell on their face. (2) Other world regions are emerging. (3) There could be other proof algorithms put in place if they become too much of a nuisance. (4) The processing power is located in China but has a more diverse ownership in the mining pools.
Where do you get the whales statistics from? maybe you count in there the exchange wallets who represent thousands of people? Anyhow the situation is still in flux and distribution can evolve depending on market dynamics: will such whales hodl to they crypto or will they cash in at some point and sell to smaller holders?


It is accessible because anyone can get it and use it anywhere in the world, to transfer money anywhere in the world. This via PC, including a small &lt;50$ raspberry pi, mobile phone, tablet, etc., particularly in regions where the banking system is weak or imposes restrictions.
Bitcoin is already quite usable in parts of the world. I am quite sure you could live on BTC in Japan. And we are precisely at the period in time where it is about to become usable to more people via bitpay, litepay and the like. Did you miss all the recent news?
Mining is indeed one of the parts where it is currently more challenging to get involved, but I do not think that it is the main part of accessibility concerns. And it is better than your possibility to create fiat, isn't it :) ?


Network effect. Value grows +/- as the square of adoption.


I think that this is the single most interesting technological advance in the IT world since ArpaNet - the future Internet - or HTTP - the basis of our daily web experience - emerged. Just like those revolutionized the way we communicate, blockchain technology and its various applications will revolutionize our financial world. What is mind-boggling is to some extend the underlying technology (blockchain, encryption, P2P e.g.) but even more so the creative application of these.
You may not find this exciting, but then why are you spending so much time refuting every single bit of my position? What is your motivation?


Yeah, sure, in a world where your phone is obsolete after 2 years, 10 years is long.
But it is new if you take some perspective and compare it to the right timescales: (1) The fiat monetary system has been around for centuries (China, 11th century), (2) it also took decades for the internet and web to develop to their current states. After the first 10 years it was still young and definitely full of promises.


No, the dollar is international for business purposes, but not user friendly outside the USD currency zone. Tell me how much use USD is to a Japanese, European or South-African buying his groceries? Even for business, you need intermediaries, it is time-consuming and costly to make cross-currency payments.
Outside the USD, EUR, JPY, CNY own comfort zones it is a pain to exchange money to the local currency, let alone to bring in the country any significant amount of money.
When BTC (or LTC, etc.) payments become more generalized, in the not too distant future, cryptocurrencies will beat fiat in terms of speed and ease, arms down (See also "Accessible" above).


Likewise with fiat currency. Do you remember that depositors at bailed-out Cyprus' largest bank lost 47.5% of their savings exceeding 100,000 EUR? Same for the Greek government who took 20% out of (larger?) savings bank accounts? And during a while limited every Greek's access to their own money in banks? This was not just volatily, this was a hard real unrecoverable loss.
Do you also realize how much value the USD looses in real value each year and since long-time every time the Fed decides to print money to pay for the deficit? (See 
See my point about "Unstoppable".


Your point about the current face value of BTC is irrelevant. If you know enough to make all those points, you also know that the actual value of a currency is relative. You might say that 3 average Western salaries are worth 1 BTC. You might also say that 3 average Western salaries are worth 100,000,000 (one hundred million) satoshi (current smallest division of the BTC).
About the transaction cost: yes, it has been up during a period, like up to 25$ at some point. It is now down to, like 5 cts? And BTC + Lighting Network (now in production and ready for broader adoption) will bring it down by one or more orders of magnitude.
Even in the "layer 1" network, you can now get transactions processed for 1 satoshi/byte (i.e. low).


As is repeatedly posted: exchanges are not banks, exchanges are places for trading.
If you do not trade against fiat or other cryptos, hold your BTC in your own (preferably cold) wallet, control your private keys, have secured backups of them. You are your own bank: the technology is safe: use it in the right way.
Anyhow, exchanges being hacked is rather less frequent than people loosing money in all forms because their PC, mobile or credentials getting compromised because of their own carelessness about data safety.
Is your money safe in banks? Besides the arbitrary decisions about your money in banks by some governments (see above) and evaporating value due to inflation, there is a large number of stories about banks being hacked, companies with your credit card information being hacked, banks being robbed, SWIFT was hacked, banks frauded and mismanaged and got bailed-out.

Not quite.
They will tax 33% on speculative revenue. The case referred to was one of a guy who developed an application for some fast trading.

Inflation is to a large extent a result of the fractional reserve system: it allows money to be created out of thin air so depreciates the value of the currency.
Admittedly it also has an effect of boosting investment and therefore real wealth generation that partly compensates this.
Still, over a long period of time some goods like houses become quite more expensive.

People currently avoiding tax using cash, secret accounts and fiscal law trickery would also just continue doing it.

I agree. With bitcoin and other cryptos **you are your own bank** with all implied rights and responsibilities: **your** crypto cannot be stolen or seized as long as **you** secure it the right way.
Eventually you will leave on your exchange whatever you may want to trade and in a cold wallet what you want to hodl for a while.
For physical cold wallets, if you have enough bitcoins to justify the investment, I would go for the Ledger (my preferred) or Trezor.
The key thing when you have a cold wallet is to have a copy of your seed or private key kept in a safe place, in a separate location, that no one but you (or a person you trust enough) can access. This could be a plastified printout in a personal safe, a metal plate, or an encrypted file on a differently encrypted partition of a HDD...

All my deposits to Kraken went smoothly.
The most recent one took 2 days on the fiat bank side, then was processed within 1-2 hours by Kraken when my fiat bank signalled that the transfer was done.

But it is very long when the spread between BTC/USD on Bitfinex and other exchanges (e.g. Bitstamp or BTC-e) is now in the range 130-180$, so 9-13%.

Hello, the second row from the bottom contains 2 AOCS coins (later also minted by Cryptmint). I am not sure about the one on the left, but the one on the right contains the statement "1TROYOZ999..."
The original Cryptmint coins had the statement "1AV OS .999..." (I have one), unless several editions existed but I do not think so.
The version with "1TROYOZ999..." you can buy from Alibaba by the ton. I have purchased a dozen that I give to friends when they get interested in bitcoin :).
A precision scale can tell the difference because the copy does not weigh the same.
Added links:
Original design: 
Some discussion about it:  . See the comment "The Aocs mint produced them then also resold them in the US, we had an agreement on a small royalty fee which they would pay on any they sold they continued selling them but didn't honour the agreement we made on the royalty fee. ..."

I guess 1 answer is the multiplicity of cryptocoins.
If some large central bank was buy a lot of one cryptocoin (call it coin1), that would drive its price up. The faster they would buy, the higher and faster the increase.
So people are selling to the bank and accumulating fiat cash or some other cryptocoin (call it coin2).
Then suppose one learns that said central bank has done that: loss of trust in coin1 =&gt; crash of that coin1.
But the concept is still out there in 10's or 100's of other cryptocoins. So the ones who cashed in when the central bank purchased the market of coin1 will buy coin2.
Eventually, central banks cannot buy a sufficient stake in all cryptocoins to alter the course.

Just a word about the "financial and economic uncertainty in Europe": I think it is no more and probably a bit less than in Asia or the US.
It is just a few countries (not Central Banks per se) in Europe who have, say, solvency issues.
And the debt levels in Europe relative to GDP are generally quite OK (about 90% of GDP) compared to the US one (about 104% of GDP)
For the US: 
For Europe 
The US gets away with it better because the US dollar is the global reference currency (albeit a bit less so with the development of China and the arrival of the Euro) so the US can increase its dollar stock ("printing banknotes") to dilute the value of the debt.
So not panic indeed: just enjoying the great weather and watching bitcoin recover :)

I think he introduced the talk of Craig Wright in a fairly neutral way. Like: "like it or not, but listen to the other parties".
Which I did. To understand all the points of view in the bitcoin ecosphere, whether I would like them or not, because it is good to have an informed opinion.
So listening to Craig Wright, I tried to take apart (1) the poor language/attitude, (2) the technology, (3) the economics and (4)  the sociology.
1) The attitude for sure does not help him get friends :). But is somewhat refreshing in our f...g all too politically correct world :).
2) I cannot say much about the math and crypto technology aspects but would like to read somewhere a point-by-point rebuttal/review of his comments.
3) I could hear some interesting views (and accept or reject these) in the economic part. Like: bitcoin is there to be massively adopted not progress slowly and have better UIs to facilitate adoption and get 0 confirmation technology at shop level to facilitate adoption by merchants.
4) At the sociology/political level he directly and indirectly raises the question whether bitcoin is best supported by a right, left, or libertarian movement.
So worth listening to even if you essentially disagree with the guy. As always, a discussion field is fenced by its extremes and it is worth listening from time to time to all parts.

The USD reserves of Bitfinex users may be drying up, so they buy less BTC while activity on other exchanges remains high? This could be a hint that the Bitfinex bubble is about to collapse unless they issue some reassuring news about their status (The post today about a financial audit due to deliver results in 8 weeks is not it: too late). I will monitor if the spread does not actually reverse, with some getting higher than Bitfinex in hours or days to come.

What happens is very similar to what happened in the early days of the personal computer revolution or the early days of the internet revolution. Both had their ups and downs, companies star one year, gone the next. All the while, a multi-trillion new economy developed in both cases.

What gives value to any currency is trust, be it cryptocurrency or so-called fiat currency.
The value is somehow linked to the number of people who trust bitcoin as a way to support of trade (current or future, hence an element of speculation), a mechanism to establish the relative value of goods.
When 2 people first traded 1 pizza against 10000 BTC (see other good comment by ruswarrior), the value network was minimal and the value of bitcoin also minimal. Now that thousands, possibly millions of people trust bitcoin and have some of it, the value is much higher.
A bit like banknotes: they would be worth near 0 if only you and your friend would use it for exchange, but the USD is worth a lot because it is a trusted fiat currency all over the world.

Interesting that the US could arrest a Russian or Bulgarian (?) national in Greece, presumably because he made means available to *others*, presumably US citizens, to escape tax and US rule.
Very frightening if the association of (1) an extradition treaty, (2) providing means that are illegal in the US but not in your own country and (3) US citizens using these means be it unknowingly - can get you arrested and extradited.

Yep, the US rejects any intervention by other countries in their state and economic affairs, but they happily and unapologetically go after anyone in any country if they think it hurts their interest.
In this case, they sure had a case to prosecute US citizens or a US exchange that did not respect the US laws. But not to remove access or take away funds owned by, say, a Greek or Venezuelan citizen who put some savings in bitcoins in a non-US exchange to keep access to funds or avoid hyperinflation though some local crisis.

Indeed if they just stop mining BTC it just extends the time to activate segwit.
I was as you suggest hypothetically wondering if some exchange(s) could break the NYA. Bad for karma for sure, but this is a wild world -_-.
P.S. I hope no one does it and both BTC+segwit and BTH just proceed on the current consensus basis.

Segwit can get activated via a number of initiatives. UASF is one of them, and a good one to push the segwit agenda, but not the only one. See  e.g.
The probability that segwit will get activated is near 100% IMHO.
The question is not IF, but WHEN: before Aug 1st? On Aug 1st? After Aug 1st?

The question is how did the account get hacked? Can't be a widespread breach otherwise 100's of people who get ripped, right?
Did the credentials get stolen on the friends PC because of some spyware or keylogger getting installed there? Was Kraken the weakest link in the chain?

Hire a tax and finance expert - a good one, not a plain accountant - that will tell you how to max your revenue out of this. Every $ spent on a good one will be worth it.
And if you do not have the cash for such an expert, just sell a couple bitcoins to cover that. I guess the IRS will not worry too much about that.
Be careful, be smart, be happy.

Positive. It solves some problems of current bitcoin design and opens up new possibilities. There are a number of posts already about this.

People who HODL do not determine the current price of bitcoin, only the people who speculate and trade.
So even if, say, 90% of bitcoin does not move, the remaining 10% and the people hedging influence the price because they buy and sell it.
In the longer run it is just noise while technology improves and tools and markets supporting global adoption are being developed.

I agree that it is time for the bitcoin miners and developers to get to a solution. I love bitcoin but I am getting concerned that it can be loosing its leading position soon, and for good.
It reminds me very much of the competition and battle that existed in the early days of personal computers, mobile phones, operating systems, office suites or web browsers. Who remembers the then leaders like Commodore, Atari, Nokia, Ericsson, CP/M, Wordperfect, Lotus Notes or Netscape?
The computing and IT cemetery is full of leading systems who were too self-centered to watch out for competition.
A few did succeed to go through several paradigm changes, such as Microsoft, Apple, IBM.
Edit: typo.

Some "commemorative" bitcoins (like Casascius, even redeemed, and some other) are worth something. Check on a coin exchange.
Anyhow, keep it. It is cool.
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:35:00
Tough indeed. I say: take a bit of a stake in all and HODL !
When you are dealing with a technical revolution, the benefits made on the winner outweigh all the losses on the loosers. So if you had at some point Commodore or Nokia shares, sell some and buy some of Apple, Microsoft, Redhat etc.

Good post and interesting analysis. Looks like a game theory dilemma. Indeed other miners could drop Jihan.
Longer term there remains the question where they will buy their ASIC hardware. Well I guess someone will fill the void.

Thanks for the nice feedback.
About your question, probably the issue for banks and other institutions creating their own cryptocoins is that they would need users. And why would anyone use a me-too private cryptocoin when bitcoin and others are out there? The bank would be like one of those launching a failed ICO that ranks 200+ in the cryptocoin list.
Indeed banks currently oversee the vast majority of current transactions and therefore the liquidity of **fiat** currencies. This will not be obviously the case if transactions are peer-to-peer: then the volume of transactions is all peer-to-peer and liquidity is inherent to the system, derived from its usage.
The more people buy and speculate on bitcoin (and other leading cryptocurrencies), the more you can pay directly using it (like it develops in Japan), the more liquidity will be managed outside of the fiat currency system.
Again I am not a specialist but my gut feeling is that the beauty of the system (long-term, setting short-term variations aside) is that the economic value of the bitcoin is determined by usage and the number of users, so liquidity is an emerging property - and well emerged by now.

Satoshi has not only invented the bitcoin; he has also found a practical solution for time travel. He will disclose it later, when bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are the norm.
@_date: 2017-07-29 17:59:18
Could be. Especially in 5 years what is like an eternity in the crypto world.
Or at least recognize bitcoin (or another cryptocoin) as legal tender in the country. A bit like some countries link their weak currency to the USD.
@_date: 2017-06-12 19:28:22
Do you think that bitcoin will die and never go back up?
If not, just trust the long-term value of bitcoin, just old to you coins and wait for the next increase. I have been through this a few times: at some points new large variations become less in any case than past gains and you can relax.
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:30:35
I am not a specialist but will try to share my view on the subject.
Answering your recap points:
1) Hello, the inherent value of bitcoin and (most) other cryptocurrencies is to be a **network of trust**.
As far as currency and value is concerned, it is pretty much back to basics: each bitcoin is a token that you mutually and trustfully accept to be worth the equivalent of some other good, be it a fiat currency or a pizza, facilitating transactions.
For bitcoin and other cryptocoins where supply is limited, it implies that value is directly linked to demand and usage. Where it becomes twisted in the short term is because of market anticipated value: the value is being evaluated on the basis not only of current usage but on anticipated future usage. As there is still uncertainty as to which currency will prevail, the pace of adoption and there are some significant technical or market hiccups and news, this cares for a lot of volatility short-term.
But unless there is some fundamental reason why the bitcoin concept would fail, the value is to go up longer-term.
2) Regarding financial institutions, the question takes a false premise: that financial institutions are any concern of the designers and would be meant to adopt cryptocurrencies. It is quite the contrary: in first instance, bitcoin is meant to be a **decentralized peer-to-peer cryptoexchange** system.
The idea is actually to make it possible to avoid financial institutions in a number of their current roles, such as guaranteeing the value of a currency.
Said that, financial institutions will find new ways to provide some form of service in this new financial ecosystem. Exchanges are an example of that.
3) No. Greater Good probably.

My deposits have always been through within 1, 2 days max. and they were small also.
Besides, Kraken remained nicely available for transactions through the dip episode the last days, unlike other exchanges.
So quite happy about them even though they may have tough times keeping up with the popularity of cryptocoins and booming number of exchange users.

Or pretty much nothing as with Segwith on litecoin.
Either way - drop, increase or nothing - the turbulence will be before the fork. The way it goes should be near 100% clear 1-2 weeks before at least.

Uncertainty about the scaling / segwit technical solution: miners and particularly one pool goes for one, the exchanges for another (or maybe the same but with a different reading) and the users signal preference for a third.
So the bitcoin "community" of miners, exchanges and users shows division and the "market" hates that. There are some big ego's around and some assholes with monopolistic views on our beloved cryptocurrency.
In other words: the bitcoin "community" is shooting itself in the foot with a bazooka.

I hope that you are right, otherwise by August 1st the "flippening" from BTC to ETH will happen and BTC will go somewhat like Betamax vs. VHS.
This old reference may not be 100% correct as an image but you get the idea: BTC could become 2nd if there is no consensus solution.

Both BTC and ETH have scalability limits, but ETH's are currently further away than BTC's. So ETH should do better on the current BTC transaction volume.
See this question and response: 
Also, the next steps of Ethereum's development (Metropolis and Serenity) seem to trigger less conflictual debate than BTC's - as far as I can see.
I very much hop that both BTC and ETH get to the next stage smoothly because it is in the interest of the whole cryptocoin ecosystem that those 2 demonstrate their ability to evolve in line with usage and demand.

I deposited a little money this week-end, like I did some weeks ago.

Well, give them credit for listening to their users.
When one sees all the rants about the various exchanges, I find Kraken's issues to be rather more benign than with other exchanges: mostly delays and technical glitches that get resolved related to the booming demand and difficulty to scale-up fast enough, but no fundamental policy or technical issues.
I hope that they and other exchanges will scale-up well and safely in the current booming period. It is in the community's interest. They must be hiring people and investing in computing capacity like mad for now !

Offline in this context means the practice of creating and signing your transaction on an offline, air-gaped device, what has privacy and security benefits.
But at some point one needs to get the signed transaction validated. For this validation a copy of the signed transaction must be  broadcast to the bitcoin network, which can happen via various channels. At some point your transaction will be broadcast on internet-connected nodes, but your own communication to one such node can use other communication channels.

There is always one predicament when talking about taxation and IRS: that you will have to convert back to USD to spend it.
A few years down the line, there may/will be enough shops accepting bitcoin in the US or over the internet that you can bypass the USD entirely.
If you have BTC or whatever cryptocoins on a private wallet that is not (easily) related to your name, you could be off the radar.
