I'm still having to almost force classmates to install ublock.
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:11:47
Guess what ? There's a sale going on right now !
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:21:49
Totally worked.
You'd think in [current year] I would have thought to try swiping before giving up.

You and your family are watching TV, when someone knocks on the door. You wife gets up to answer. She gets pulled outside and is immediately held hostage at gun point. You move towards the commotion and see a second armed man, now pointing a gun at you.
He says that if you move or do anything other than follow his orders, the guy who has you wife outside will blow her fucking brains out.
At this point you realize two other men have now come in through the back. One of them also points his guns at you, so you have two guys pointing guns at you from either side of the room, and the fourth one has gone straight for your kid and is now holding him at gun-point too.
Would you really pull out *muh gunz* and risk your familie's life ? Or do you expect to live the rest of your life like some recluse who empties his gun at every noise, creak or shadow ?

Not OP, but this is exactly how I got done a few years back.
I worked part time at a company, and filed my taxes as any other temp job I'd had before.
Four years later I get a letter in the mail from the IRS saying that that company declared me as a freelance rather than a temp, and I now owed 2K in back taxes from that special category.
Great way to find out that my old company was a piece of shit, and that stuff from years ago can resurface.
My message to OP is, just do the right thing, because even if you "get away with it", it's still a bona-fide crime, and at any moment it could catch up with you.
@_date: 2018-01-02 02:41:59
Ugh, I know exactly what you mean.
This "friend" of mine was trying to watch a TV show, and kept clicking on the most bogus obviously fake link, and downloading .exe files. Eventually she got a virus, and came crying to me.
I told her everything she was doing was wrong, and just stop. I fix everything, installed ublock origin, then Malwarebytes, and sent her on her way.
A fucking day later she comes fucking back, crying about some weird Chinese boot screen on her now unusable laptop.
As she's explaining what she did, she basically admits she turned off ublock, because she couldn't find any of her bogus download links (duh, you moron), then when she was able to download fake files again, they would get "deleted" by Malwarebytes (quarantined, you moron), so she also switched of Malwarebytes....
After that I said it was really unfortunate, and she should be a little more careful with what she downloaded.
What I wanted to do was grab her by the throat, throw her down on the pavement, and bash her fucking skull in with her now fucked up computer, for being such a dumb fuck.
@_date: 2018-01-02 02:19:41
That's amazing news to me. Thanks OP.
@_date: 2018-01-02 02:29:42
Same. I was young, and hanging out on 4chan a lot some years ago. 
Eventually, silk road, dark web, and bitcoin topics came up and caught my attention.

How do I get my Android eclair wallet to show an address that I can pump into the faucet website ?
@_date: 2018-01-02 02:59:23
Yeah, so he'll totally have made back his investment in 8.33 years, but from then on, it easy money baby!!!

"You might have thousands of cases calculated together in highly corroborative statistics, but look at what happened this one time back in the seventies; I certainly don't need anymore info than that. No Sir"

The Government, stepping on the little guys. Business as usual.
@_date: 2019-07-30 00:33:40
Yeah they sent out emails counting down the weeks to final closing day. Sad, was a perfect way to spend bitcoin anywhere that accepted VISA. I even linked it to my Samsung pay.
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:41:53
But how would they know which slither of bitcoin was bought at which price, to then try and tackle on a gains tax?
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:04:37
So taxed using bitcoin, as well as regular state tax on items ?
I think I'm starting to get why the 1% fight tooth and nail to create tax loopholes.
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:54:26
Exactly, which is why most people will warn against "day trading", a quick unpredictable spike up or down, and you screw yourself.
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:49:25
Show me on the Blockchain where they touched you.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:55:47
So what you're saying is HODL until you've spent all the bitcoin, without ever going back to USD or any other coin ?
@_date: 2018-09-09 18:16:03
[In some disgustingly backward places, yes.](
@_date: 2018-09-09 12:16:26
Once the Blockchain is downloaded, how much data does it use? I might be completely wrong, but I thought it needed to occasionally re-download everything. Data consumption is what has put me off building one, so hopefully I'm wrong.

@_date: 2017-12-22 15:30:16
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:34:52
Yeah, two-three weeks back got mine for $73. This is just re-sellers trying to scalp them.
@_date: 2019-07-29 23:39:34
Has to be, I had that Shift Card they show at the end, used it quite a bit, but they recently closed down.
@_date: 2018-09-09 15:33:44
That's alota data !
Thanks for info.
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:27:36
Guess that makes sense.
I have been tracking everything. Plus the exchanges give you a purchase history.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:42:28
Let the weak perish brother, only the strong will rise forth.
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:23:33
Oh, hi Roger !
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:44:58
So the IRS itself is another reason to HODL.
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:56:32
So I transfer from Gdax to Trezor for free (this part I knew). 
Then need to make sure the Trezor wallet is a bc1 adresse, so that if I send money from it, the fee is almost cut in half?
I've left a little in my gdax, because I remembered the fees back to gdax, and so didn't want to out it all on my Trezor.
Just checked, all of my adresses are 3, need to figure out how to get a bc1.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:40:53
My exact first thought, where the hell is that coming from?
@_date: 2017-12-28 06:00:30
Ah, ffs.
@_date: 2018-09-09 18:11:04
Yeah, that happened to me a few years back now that I think about it. I was at home setting up DropBox on a new laptop, closed the lid and thought nothing of it ... until I got to Uni and opened it back up and it finished sycing 80Gb worth of video files in the background.
Got an email saying if I continued to use that much data, I would get a temporary hold on my campus internet access.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:43:43
"OR DIE LIKE A BTCH"
@_date: 2018-09-09 15:32:44
Wonder if I could just set one up at my office, and let it run off of the universitie's network ?
@_date: 2017-12-29 17:57:06
I bought mine literally just a couple of days before the prices shot up. It was insane.
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:35:24
Same goes for Trezor.
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:53:25
The ELI5 is: because you can't predict the future.
How do you know it will go lower than $500, when you sell at $500 ? For all you know in that very instant, it could shoot right back up after you sell, and $500 ended up being the rock bottom.
@_date: 2018-09-09 14:37:09
That's kinda what I feared. I'd need more exact numbers, as comcast counts both up &amp; down-loads as part of their monthly capped data usage.
Fucking scum company, but got nothing else.
@_date: 2018-08-20 12:44:18
We need to throw the whole thing out and get a better OP.
@_date: 2017-11-21 09:37:59

hey its me ur cousin.
@_date: 2017-11-28 02:08:12
in case anyone else thinks of it, and hopefully this message avoids others repeatedly reminding him, I sent a permalink back to that guy asking to be reminded of his post in the future.
@_date: 2017-11-17 13:25:04
thanks, missed a few zeroes there.
It's actually interesting, you can figure out when they wrote the show based on their price.
@_date: 2017-11-26 01:11:10
BUY. try not to pay fees either, so either gdax; or for much lower fees, gemini.
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:33:55
Pretty crazy, I found one on campus a week ago.
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:39:59

Hello darkness my old friend.
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:08:41
Probably invested in Bcash, poor soul.
@_date: 2017-11-17 02:33:48
Nope, that's pretty much spot on, I'm just stupid cheap; and yeah, use the "limit" option on gdax to pay nothing in fees.
@_date: 2017-11-21 03:51:44
Fuck, really can't even look away from the screen for a second around here.
It started to drop and I bought at $8200, gonna go dry my tears.
@_date: 2017-11-21 03:47:27
It was shooting down, and then on gdax, I saw an order on $7800 for 162BTC. Someone is banking on it going higher.
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:41:11
Any way to get past the $500 limit ? I had wanted to piss 10 grand away, and now also regret not eating the damn coinbase fees.
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:46:33
Maybe one day I'll get to "who gives a damn about fees" levels of money.
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:20:24
1. Be rich
2. Don't be poor
3. Get richer
Honestly quite simple, and surprised more people aren't just following these three easy steps.
@_date: 2017-11-17 01:50:28
That's a $25 fee from my bank :(
Also before doing that I wanted to "test the waters" to make sure it is going to the place, and see the delay, but the $25 is keeping me away from doing a small "test" wire.
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:44:46
The Mooniest !
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:32:20
Yay, internet high five.
Spent all week boasting the value of it to my brother, and he finally went in for a whole 1 at the same price point as you. I haven't dared tell him, as it hasn't even cleared into gemini yet.
@_date: 2017-11-21 09:24:57
You sound eerily like a friend of mine who did just that.
@_date: 2017-11-17 13:38:43
It's kinda weird that 8k is like this scary ceiling that seems to be the sell point for a lot of people. It just won't budge.
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:51:30
My Trezor is on it's way, I would hate to lose my BTCs by a few days ...
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:23:00
You can get them for $65 today, and I snatched a trezor for $70. Scooped them both up.
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:38:17
They should do a quick fix voice-over to reflect current values.
@_date: 2017-11-21 04:00:23
Made the same mistake as you about two weeks ago when I started.
There are tricks for paying no fees by using Gdax (and you sign in to them with a coinbase account, so you've got that covered): use the "deposit" to get USD dollars to them for free, then use the "limit" under *buy option*, and that you can use for free.
Otherwise I use Gemini, they have fees, but they are like a 1/10 of coinbase's, and they let you do $500 instant transfers (technically they front you the money, but forget about it).
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:56:47
and my brother !
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:18:32
I was crying internally just at the sheer amount of fees he was forking over to coinbase. Man's gotta learn to gdax or something.
@_date: 2017-11-21 09:25:25
It is known.
@_date: 2017-11-17 13:36:02
I was waiting for that one to hit (next week I think), but this one surprised both me and my wife. She was happy to know what it was after hearing me yak about it this past month.
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:17:27
I think gemini is down too, at least i can't get to it.
@_date: 2018-02-17 13:23:21
Sorry if this is dark, but I really hope this is just conbase lying through their teeth, and they get in trouble for this when it comes to light they were BSing.
That whole company needs a swift fucking ass-kicking.
@_date: 2018-02-02 07:45:46
But aren't those people creating a ton of taxable events by doing so? Is it still worth it if every time you think you've made a great day trade, you're having to store X percent for Uncle Sam?
@_date: 2017-10-08 21:18:58
Thanks a million, I never check the sidebar.
You're totally right, there even that link called: how to buy bitcoin worldwide. Guess I'm gonna educate myself.
@_date: 2017-10-08 20:18:34
Is "buying in" as easy as creating an account, and putting some bitcoin in a cart?
(kinda clueless, and only thing I can picture is like buying a book from Amazon)
@_date: 2019-09-29 13:01:37

At the risk of waaay over-simplifying history, the French version of the commonwealth happened in North-Africa, so I guess it makes sense.
