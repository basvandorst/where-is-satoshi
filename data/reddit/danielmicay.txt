Apple said won't have access to it themselves. However, Goldman and perhaps Mastercard will have access. See their own statements.


Note they don't say the data won't be shared, just that it won't be sold to third parties for marketing and advertising, which is at least an improvement over a standard credit card if true.

It doesn't support secp256k1 so it can't be used for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-06 17:36:25
An HSM without secure display and confirmation is also not an equivalent to a hardware wallet as the article inaccurately claims. Even if it did support secp256k1, it couldn't display a recovery seed for the initial backup or offer confirmation for transactions. An attacker with control of the OS could do whatever they want, including stealing all the money. They just can't extract the keys. A basic general purpose HSM is not a hardware wallet.

See  It can gather more data by combining many slightly different frames. Huawei is taking a more sophisticated approach with substantial hardware support. It's similar to HDR+. It's not inferring / guessing the data.

The NDK isn't designed for writing an entire app but rather performance critical portions. It's designed for writing libraries used by an app primarily written in Java or Kotlin. It doesn't have the majority of the APIs exposed directly to it, only ones that make sense for performance critical code to be using like GPU rendering. Heavily using memory unsafe languages would be a substantial regression too, if you mean that you would be writing it in C and C++. It makes sense for the vast majority of the code to be written in memory / type safe languages. It's a very poor security decision to write more than a minimal amount of code in languages incredibly prone to code execution vulnerabilities.
The only officially supported options for writing Android apps are Java and Kotlin, other than low-level library portions where C and C++ are supported. Other languages can be used, but they'll need to target either Java or Java bytecode as their compilation target to be viable for writing the majority of an app. It should not be a surprise that an Android app is written in one of those two languages, and making the decision not to use native libraries outside of some exceptions like a very well written cryptographic library is a good design choice for security.
@_date: 2019-04-27 15:58:55


What language would you have chosen for an Android app? At least it's memory safe even though it's not a modern language. It could be largely written in Kotlin now but that wasn't official supported when it was originally written.

To provide privacy instead of revealing your account balances and transaction histories to exchanges, merchants and other people.
@_date: 2019-01-24 14:46:30
Yeah and the issue is that most of these phones claiming they have a hardware wallet only add an HSM with secp256k1 support. It really isn't the same thing, since all it does is prevent an attacker that has exploited the OS from extracting the private keys. They can still steal all the money by making their own transactions on the device, just not the keys.
I *have* seen a phone that actually provides a dedicated display for the recovery seed, but I'm not sure if they have a secure way of providing input or if it requires confirming transactions with that screen. I have a feeling that they might have only provided a secure way to back up, and potentially not even a secure way to recover, let alone proper confirmation of transactions.

It's not unregulated. It's not *regulated as a currency*. The enforcement of the regulations is very slow moving but it's catching up to the world of cryptocurrencies.


No, that's not true.


They've done plenty of regulation and seizures of cryptocurrency. The US federal government has even sold bitcoin they've seized.

@_date: 2019-01-04 21:48:48
They can patch implementation flaws, but not having the display and trusting the smartphone is a fundamental flaw. At most, they can properly protect the keys like an HSM. However, an attacker can have all your bitcoin sent to their address if they've compromised your desktop/smartphone and there's no way for their device to prevent it. The design fundamentally trusts the general purpose devices to not be compromised in order to display the amount / receive address / fee. They've said their next version will have a display and it's not really something that can be left out. Protecting the keys is a bit better than nothing but when you make a transaction, if an attacker controls your desktop and smartphone, it can't protect you from all the money being stolen. The same security model (safe against attacker controlling only 1/2 general purpose devices) can be done *without* any extra hardware so it's not accomplishing much as is.
@_date: 2019-01-04 21:27:46
Nothing wrong about that. You aren't even trying to argue otherwise. A crucial part of a hardware wallet is securely displaying the amount, fee and destination address. Since it doesn't have a display, you don't have that. If your general purpose computing devices (smartphone included) are compromised, an attacker can get all your money. It's not a proper hardware wallet.
@_date: 2019-01-04 21:24:31
Sorry, but it's not wrong. You have an HSM protecting the key without on-device display / confirmation. It's not a proper hardware wallet and doesn't protect you against an attacker that has gained control over your general purpose devices. They can have you send all your money to their address without you knowing. It only protects your keys from being stolen, which is pretty much useless when they can steal all your money without them. Your money isn't more secure than it would be with a system splitting trust between your desktop + phone and requiring both. The on-device display / confirmation is not something that can be omitted like that while providing true hardware wallet security.
@_date: 2019-01-04 21:21:33
It's not a proper hardware wallet since it depends on your general purpose computing devices with massive attack surface not being compromised.
@_date: 2019-01-04 21:29:45
Their website doesn't disagree with anything that I'm saying. It's not a proper hardware wallet and has little value. Obviously, they aren't going to admit that their own product is poorly designed since their goal is selling it to make money.
@_date: 2019-01-04 21:45:19
Educate yourself:
This is the security model:


Their hardware isn't even required to provide that security model. It's not proper hardware wallet security. It protects the keys from attackers compromising your general purpose computing devices, *but not your bitcoin*.
The design is fundamentally flawed and can't be fixed. They don't have a magical solution to the issues that make a display important, and they have design issues beyond that along with a lot of implementation issues. The device is completely broken and doesn't work as a proper hardware wallet. The company behind it has stated that the 2nd version will have a display, and hopefully they don't make other mistakes with the design. The 1st version is beyond saving.
@_date: 2019-01-24 14:52:34
I strongly disagree with implying a proper hardware wallet like a Trezor is a gimmick even if it's always online. Many hardware wallets are just an HSM without proper confirmation of transactions and I don't really think they deserve to be called a hardware wallet at all if all they do is acting as an HSM for the key and don't even implement anything Bitcoin specific in the hardware for having confirmation of transactions. Having it offline when possible is ideal, but if the computer being used with it is compromised then it needs to stand up to exploits the next time it's attached and a Trezor is very good at that. That's the main attack vector and the main thing a hardware wallet mitigates. Physical access is an inherently losing battle and they do stand up to that better than alternatives, but it shouldn't be expected that a resourceful attacker can't extract the data (thus using a passphrase, and ideally having on-device input for it so a compromised computer doesn't expose it).
If Google simply extended the standard keystore algorithms to include secp256k1, every phone would offer as much as HTC's 'blockchain' phone and probably this Samsung offering too.
@_date: 2019-01-24 14:41:58
A hardware wallet without a dedicated secure display and input is also much less useful as it's only able to prevent an attacker from stealing the private keys. If they compromise the OS, they can still substitute your intended transactions with their own unless it has a secure way of displaying data not going through the OS. The ideal is also having a secure way to enter a passphrase on the hardware wallet itself, like the Trezor Model T.


That's not all they are. The whole point is having orders of magnitudes less attack surface than a general purpose OS on general purpose hardware, and a Trezor achieves that very well. It's certainly better to have a Trezor than a wallet on a mobile phone. However, an HSM in the phone for storing the key without secure display / input doesn't mean there's an actual hardware wallet. It isn't *worthless* but it's only a marginally useful feature for this.


It's not really the main attack vector they're meant to defend against though. Physical access is inherently going to lead to being able to extract any data, etc. and the best that can be done is substantially increasing the cost / delaying it.
@_date: 2019-01-20 21:45:40
Or in a wallet with an alternate passphrase, especially if the passphrase feature was explicitly enabled like on a Trezor.

Which means there are other people with access to the PIN...
In all likelihood you're just not correctly remembering what you set up as the PIN.

You need to be patient if you use a low transaction fee. There are wallets implementing the replace-by-fee feature to cope with choosing a fee that was too low. As long as you use a wallet where you control your keys, even if it doesn't have replace-by-fee support you can use another one to do it.

ECDSA keys are not simply completely random blobs. The secp256k1 and secp256r1 curves target the 128-bit security level, just like a 3072 bit RSA key. You cannot simply generate a completely random value and use it as an ECDSA or RSA key, as they aren't just a totally random number with no rules. A fully random seed / most forms of symmetric keys match the size of the security level. You can't just apply that to arbitrary other things with different kinds of data.
I'm talking about the security level, not the size of structured asymmetric keys or hashes. Hash strength depends on how it's used. A 256 bit hash (assuming no breaks in the cryptography) provides only 128 bit security against some attacks (birthday attack with no other factors involved). Lengths of asymmetric keys and hashes don't correspond directly to a symmetric key equivalent security level.
@_date: 2018-12-26 14:33:35
For the BIP39 standard (2048 possible words), 12 word seeds are ~128-bit entropy and 24 word seeds are ~256-bit entropy. As long as the seed is properly generated, 12 words is more than enough. Bitcoin itself targets the 128-bit security level, so you can't do better than that and it's not necessary or useful in the real world, which is why Bitcoin doesn't use 256-bit security level primitives.
A useful reason to use a 24 word seed would be splitting up your written backup into 2 parts with both required. If an attacker obtained one of the two word lists, they would still be facing insurmountable 128-bit security. 64-bit wouldn't be nearly enough to make a brute force infeasible.

It is registered:  It could be enforced without being registered too. Either way, it doesn't change that it's unethical to masquerade as the product and you aren't going to receive any support if you aren't going to be honest with the product naming. It's not a Trezor, it's a separate device bot affiliated with them and must be called something else to be legal and ethical. Otherwise, it's dishonesty misleading people and infringing the trademark.
@_date: 2018-12-29 16:52:50
It needs a secure way of displaying information and confirming transactions too. Simply using an HSM to store the seed means a compromise of the OS can't get the seed, but the attacker could make transactions without the seed. It needs to be more than that to be a proper hardware wallet. A phone could have an alternate display on the back used only by the hardware wallet, etc. but that's a much larger feature than simply including secp256k1 support in the existing hardware-backed keystore(s) which is all most phones claiming Bitcoin support are going to do.
@_date: 2018-12-12 14:22:15
It's illegal to call it a Trezor. Using the code and hardware design is legal. Calling it a Trezor and misleading people into thinking it's an official product is not legal. Consult a lawyer...

Yes, 128-bit. I'm not talking about the length of hashes.
@_date: 2018-12-26 14:38:04
12 word BIP39 seeds provide ~128-bit entropy which is more than enough. You're giving incorrect advice. Bitcoin itself targets 128-bit security. If someone can break that, they can break the entirety of Bitcoin and steal anyone's money. The whole point of the 128-bit security level is that it's far more than will ever be necessary. Weaknesses in cryptographic primitives reducing their security far below 128-bit is possible, but 128-bit security itself including as the entropy for a random seed / key is more than enough.

Unregistered trademarks exist and are enforceable. Hsving it registered is optional and just makes enforcing it easier. It is a registered trademark though:  Regardless, portraying it as a Trezor when it's not is unethical in addition to being illegal. You need to use your own branding and then you won't be violating their trademark or accused of making a scam. Why not just do things properly and ethically?
@_date: 2018-12-26 19:02:43
Yeah, there's just no good reason to target 256 bit security and it would bloat the signatures, etc.
