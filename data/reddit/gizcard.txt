if I find some open API for price/volume - I can do so (the current price plot is free widget, not sure if they have the API, tweet counts are my own data which I generate from twitter streaming api). What exactly do you mean by "difficulty"?

That is a little different in the sense that hype-meter is designed to track real-time sentiment. Currently, it tracks tweets on per-minute basis. I tried (and can do so) on 1 second basis or, perhaps less, but I found that there is no good reason to do it more frequently than 1 minute.

Fixed that - thanks!

Bitcoin isn’t private and was never intended to be. It solves different sets of problems while still making it easy (easier than regular cash) to catch money launderers
Edit: and, of course, Libra is just FB’s scam

Moore law is slowing and everybody now owns mobile devices instead of desktops, so don't count on this too much.
