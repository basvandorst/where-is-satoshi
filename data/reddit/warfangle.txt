It's more about ACID compliance and record locking than the lack of a join statement.

At the document level, but when you need to make a transaction that modifies more than one document you're pretty much SOL in terms of record locking.

Thing is, Pascal is a pretty good teaching language. It can teach you about the absolute basics (variables, assignment, flow control, loops, sorting algorithms, etc) without the shit of BASIC or qBASIC, and without the distraction of more advanced topics like inheritance. The closest we've got with modern languages is Python.

Those same questions are rather convoluted when it comes to, e.g., USD as well.

You mine for a pool that mines many different cryptocoins at the same time?
How does this work?

Nonetheless: even if it were a public repo with restricted access, the process of lawmaking can definitely be replayed as diffs. A bill is basically a diff of the code of law, after all.
If the public could see a proposed bill, the changes to that bill during its deliberation (both on the floor and in committee), submit changes of their own (to be sponsored by a sitting representative/senator), and comment on pull requests (code review) .... 
It'd be kind of an amazing tool for opening the legislative process, even if citizens alone couldn't directly merge the diffs.

Ah, but the concepts learned are still useful are they not? :) This is the point of an education language.

Well, once you factor in all the fake accounts, that's like 60k right?

Probably property taxes, like everywhere else. Rich folks live in the county, county gets really good public schools.

Same. Except it was around the time when someone bought a pizza with an obscene amount of them.
I mined them with a regular old CPU.

On the other hand, one of my friends was almost raped at gunpoint.
So there's that.

Good old spring-gravity graph visualization techniques. Interesting to watch build, but useless for analysis.

Consumption, e.g., purchasing things, makes the economy run. Almost as much as borrowing (cash creation; all money is debt blahblah) does.
If you don't buy things, businesses shut down because .. oh wait, they don't make any fucking money.
Plebe. 
Gross overconsumption is one thing, but the main malaise of the jobs situation has nothing to do with over consumption and everything to do with lack of consumption because *nobody has any fucking money*.

I had a USB key with a wallet on it that I mined ~30 bitcoins with in early 2009. I got rid of it in an apartment moving cleanse in 2010.
Ye gods.

The paranoid delusions on this subreddit and the submitted articles are enlightening.

Wouldn't that mean the price would become 'stickier,' evening out some of the volatility?

We also know that Google uses BigTable, arguably for more than either MySQL or Oracle RDBMS. I have a feeling that they have very domain specific file systems that are replicated across datacenters.

You just tipped the wrong person. Oops.

Indeed, and some internode traffic may be rather expensive to encrypt, if it's taking care of replicating a custom distributed file system.

Ah the ad hominem attack. Somehow I doubt you know very little about my personal political leanings. Good job trying to derail things though; apropos for a neophyte troll. 
Edit: after reading the site linked,  I have come to a sad realization.  You've been duped. Once one boils an ideological argument down to an us versus them dichotomy (in your case,  the Statists versus the Freedom Fighters). 
What this means in actuality? You tend to resort to ad hominem attacks rather than engage in productive debate. 
I was attempting to spark a debate,  not a verbal diarrhea expulsion.

I don't think many clients support it yet, and I'm pretty sure any payment processors don't implement it yet, but third-party escrow is possible within bitcoin itself (where 2/3 parties involve agree that a transaction should, well, transact).
@_date: 2013-06-24 18:04:50
The idiots who don't realize that bitcoin isn't anonymous, and holy shit the government can actually subpoena you for your wallet.
Just 'cause it's on the internet doesn't mean the folks who use it don't have to follow the law.

Weird does not equate to the derogatory "de-socialized, dysfunctional 'fucking nuts'" blanket statement.
And somehow I feel that just meeting someone isn't sufficient to personally judge their mental health, and that you feel comfortable doing so says more about you than anything else. Unless you're a betazoid. Which I thoroughly doubt.

Have you met 100 adult teachers in your adult life, and known them long enough to assess not just their teaching quality but their psychological health and social aptitude? Furthermore, you're a neckbeard on reddit. How are you to judge someone's teaching quality, psychological health and social aptitude? Likely you have none of the above, so not only is it sampling bias but also the dunning-kruger effect hard at work!

Aaaaand this, ladies and gentlemen, is why you consult a lawyer when deciding on certain kinds of business practices. Whether you deal in cash, credit, or btc.
@_date: 2013-06-22 18:04:50
Er, no, they'd subpoena your wallet public keys and map your transactions much more fully than they could ever have done with dollar bills.

I think is comparing buying 1btc to buying 1 share of stock in the bitcoin economy

Encryption would have to be built into this stuff at the virtual file system level for google scale, I think. A little bit more difficult than just making sure you encrypt an HTTP POST.
@_date: 2013-06-24 18:08:02
What're you going to do when a judge issues a subpoena for your wallet addresses?
Oh, that's right, you'll either give them up or go to jail for contempt...
