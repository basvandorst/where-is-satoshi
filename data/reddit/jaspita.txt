That is not completely correct. When you withdraw the USD from Bitstamp, they are automatically converted into EUR (with the associated fee, which I do not know how much it is). They charge 0.90€ for fiat withdrawals.

"You would need a VERIFIED account to access these pages." FTFY

Noone should be legislating on probabilities but in facts. Legislating on mere probabilities kills personal liberties.
Noone should forbid taking a drug because the probability of hurting someone increases, but forbid the fact of hurting someone, either you are under the influence of some drug or not.

I do believe that driving impaired does put others at direct risk, as does driving perfectly sober, as does driving under the influence of legal drugs, as does when you have not had enough sleep. All it is a question of wheter or not driving under all these circumstances it is directly harming anyone, as i have already stated.
Another different debate is if you want to forbid things only based on the posibility of something bad happening, in which case the debate will extend much further until reaching a lot of different situations.

RESPOSTING FOR THE LAZY:
I have been researching about this since your post and I succeed in broadcast an offline generated raw transaction.
I have used this tool:
(you can download a zip version of this web by clicking in the bottom right corner of the website)
The steps are as follows:
* In the Source Address box input the address from which you are sending funds in the transaction.
* The website automatically will ask you if you want to download the transaction history of that address. Click Accept
* Click on Edit history and copy the whole text in the Transaction history box. Save this in a text file. You will need this piece of text offline, so save it in whatever device you will use offline.
* Open the tool from the zip version.
* Click Transaction on the upper Menu
* Click in the Edit history box and paste the text saved in your text file.
* Fill the Private key, Source Address, Destination Address and Transaction Fee boxes.
* The amount you want to send should be input in the BTC box near the destination address.
* Copy the resulting text in the Raw transaction box and copy into a text file.
* Go to  and paste the Raw transaction information.
* Voilà! Transaction transmitted! :D
I have just transmitted this transaction and it is already confirmed: 
It worked!
Good luck!
PS: When there is change in the transaction you have to input the change address after clicking in the + box in the Destination address line. Here an example I just broadcasted which has already been confirmed:
Of course you can input whichever address you want your change to go to.

Google translation:
"Russia just banned Bitcoin , China did a few months ago and Western governments are seriously considering it . All appeal to the need to combat smuggling, but none tells the truth. In the end, so strange unanimity in this matter when all these countries do not even agree on defining , and respect , a minimum of human rights.
Happens that is not the rights of his subjects that Bitcoin puts in check , but his own authority. Not surprisingly, one of the essential monopolies for all government absolutist claims is the coin : controlling the currency can control aggregate spending and controlling aggregate spending can control the structure of production , namely , what goods and services are produced or stop producing .
He had to be a former employee of the Federal Reserve, Mark Williams , who has had to finally admit the truth (or part thereof) in the Financial Times : "Governments should be wary of allowing the existence of virtual currency until they are able to ensure that central banks will be able to retain their power. " Smuggling , carrying some risk , it is a very minor problem for Williams. Of course , the writer is not sincere to the point of binding his passionate defense of monopoly central banking with the need for States to maintain their autocratic powers : his is a supposedly technocratic argument , one where the legitimacy of the relationship power is irrelevant and which only come into consideration eminently technical issues.
Thus, according to this former employee of the Fed , Bitcoin is dangerous because "it shows that we can organize ourselves without money issued by the state," when such a claim is no more than illusory to the extent that governments - and in particular their armed wings , the central banks, must deal with managing the money supply and interest rates to provide some macroeconomic calm as price stability , full employment and growth. In this sense , the optimal monetary policy in an economy requires a large staff of workers within each central bank that is specifically dedicated to the very complex task to model , understand and respond to the fluctuating behavior and expectations of economic agents . According to Williams , this whole process of due diligence is not automatable using the algorithm contained in any existing or virtual currency that might exist . It is true that , as he himself recognizes , central banks were unable to prevent the crisis that erupted in 2008 , but believed we would now be submerged in a devastating depression if not for his decisive action since. In short, the adoption of Bitcoin would lead to chaos.
Williams 's analysis may seem convincing to fuer -ideological , but the truth is that incurs a number of basic errors . The fundamental - the bedrock of the others is to confuse money and debt : but today is usually considered to euros or dollars are the "base money " from an economy - and that base money is created by the central bank - monopoly , the fact is that euros or dollars are liabilities of the central bank. For narrow money should understand that only monetary asset that is no one else's liability , the gold at the time and in the future perhaps Bitcoin . In this sense, then , the central bank does not take the business of production and cash management , but the management of part of the debt by a company that coordinates .
The distinction is important because just attacks the core of the criticism of Williams : macroeconomic stability requires a " scientific management " of money . Not so: as the amount of money does not suffer from sudden fluctuations, macroeconomic stability can be achieved through proper management quantitative and qualitative credit supply . In fact, even the best possible management of the central banks would have been able to beat the results obtained with the gold standard. But , and that is the main intellectual error of central banks , the credit management can not and should be centralized administration , since any operator enjoys the ability to extend credit to their peers (if differ upon payment we are extending credit ) . Instead, the administration will be decentralized and need , therefore, what is necessary is that the decentralized administration is subject to healthy incentives and balances designed to prevent abusive credit management.
Chief among these healthy incentives and balances is that creditors can control the debtors : if a monetary system where the ability to control the creditors, debtors necessarily tend to multiply to reckless and unsustainable extremes markedly Void is instituted . And precisely the major mechanism by which creditors have to monitor debtors is poderles deny credit (either demanding payment of debts due or not extending new credit ) , for which there must be some form of " seed money " that is not based on debt . As mentioned, gold or Bitcoin can aspire to play that role , they are assets that are not simultaneously liabilities of anyone else. But the euro or the dollar not because they are central bank debt that it can create no other limit than the repudiation by their holders ( not would , of course , a state currency that is not debt, but the amount of which the discretion to decide the State at any time) : if the central bank has the power to indefinitely refinance borrowers , it is obvious that the power of creditors ends up being destroyed and there is no way unless the clumsy state regulation to restrict the growth explosive debt .
So the criticism of Williams are fallacious : because the problem is not that the Fed was not able to avoid the crash of 2008 , but was the author or at least one of his main helper needed . Without the Fed ( and other central banks ) , the accumulation of debt would never have reached the levels achieved and therefore the risk of deflationary collapse - whose decision in Williams based much of his defense of the monopoly of central banking and it even existed. True, even with monetary and banking Freedom may be banking panics banking panics - even important - but panics are perfectly solvable by the banking industry itself.
In short , a triumph of Bitcoin (or restoration of the gold standard ) would not eliminate the need for proper management of credit ( that is , at bottom , as Williams is thinking ): only allow decentralize much and especially , submit to the counterweights necessary for you to be a truly rational management . Ironically , the defense makes the former employee of the Fed from their employer is the main reason I have to close it : because the Fed -as debtor first is instance - not subject to dispersed control of their creditors ( as they can not force payment of those liabilities not being convertible into money) , so that not only has extraordinary ability to continue priming the supply of credit (at the expense of its creditors ), but lacks even when accounting basis for being granted too and when too little credit . Without subjecting the debt of money, central bank policy is not science, but necromancy : one aimed at shoring necromancy state power ."

You have to assume the customer already have both bitcoin and fiat. If you do not have bitcoin I agree with you there is no point in buying some JUST to purchase something online.
But if you DO have both you would save some money in processing fees buying with Bitcoin instead of buying with Credit Card. That is the kind of saving I was trying to point out.

Everybody should take into account the fee the bank charges for the currency conversion.
I just made a purchase of $10 worth of BTC with my VISA debit card. It went as follows: Circle charges $10.29 ($10 + 2.9% for using the debit card) to my debit card. The bank converts it to euro charging me 8.26€.
That makes a exchange rate of 1.2458 $/€, which compared to the ECB exchange rate (1.2701) results in another 1.9% in fees.
In conclusion, I have instant bitcoins purchased with my debit card for a 5.5% fee. Still pretty good deal!
@_date: 2014-03-28 10:11:22

Most of companies accepting payments with Bitpay do not pay ANY fees.
There are ways

Country: Spain
Buy with credit card - tried with both Mastercard and Visa (both debit) - working - 2.9% CC fee
Sell to credit card - haven't tried yet (HODL you all!) but option available
Buy from bank account - not available yet

Concerning the [downside]( pointed out by it could be fixed if the wallets had an option to automatically resend rejected low-priority transactions.
When you know you are broadcasting a transaction which has very low priority, you could check the "Automatically rebroadcast tx if rejected" box.
I do not know how to code, but I guess it would not be difficult to implement such feature.
There is a much bigger problem if something like that were implemented, and it is that it would be much more risky for merchants to accept 0-conf transactions as final payment. In the context of an online purchase if would not be a big problem, but for face to face transactions (as paying for the restaurant bill) it would definitely be.
However, it would be solved if somehow the merchant could require this feature when receiving the payment.

The fee density of your transaction is only 2.7 sat/B as you can see [here](
The fee density required now to get sure your transaction gets in the next block is almost 40 sat/B as you can check [here](
So you should have used a miner fee ~15 times higher.
I know, you can't set the fee in Breadwallet, that is why the community should encourage wallet developers to let the people set the transaction fee manually or at lease implement a better fee calculation algorithm.

You can try to purchase with your credit card in purse.io.
Bitcoin price there has a premium, but if it works and considering the lack of options that may be an option.

The problem I see is that you do not control the private keys, thus, they just owe you some coins, you are not in control of them.

$1100 for a HARD coin is absurd beyond all tenable logic
let's see..... NO retailers accept it
converting GOLD into to dollars involves a substantial currency/friction risk
market is very illiquid unlike forex which contributes to the market friction
no one gets paid in GOLD. so even if major retailers accept GOLD only .00001% of the population will have any to spend with
spending fiat to buy GOLD so you can shop with GOLD is redundant
obvious bubble. parabolic chart doomed to crash
not even anonymous. the feds are all over GOLD now
cumbersome, hard to use for non-tech people, 14 minute delay between transactions
no consumer protection. perfect for scammers
most of the usage here  is from satoshi dice, wallet transfers, etc and relativity few actual productive commerce
