You realize you're well out of the mainstream here, right? It's not a wallet's job to play politics with their users' stored funds. Any wallet that doesn't give their users access to the absolute maximum amount of the value stored in the wallet is a failure. The market's job is to determine the value on both sides of a fork, and the wallet's job is to give me access to all of my fucking money. Breadwallet has consistently done the right thing here.

All of these answers are shit, frankly. A Bitcoin isn't some discrete, serialized digital "thing". The Bitcoin you own is just a number written on massive public ledger (list of transactions). 
If your balance is 0.001 Bitcoin (1/1000th of one Bitcoin), you could also say you have 1 Millibit. The label "Bitcoin" is just the base unit label (like Meter is to length). Feel free to use the most appropriate unit, just as a truck driver might deal in Kilometers, and a molecular biologist might deal in Nanometers.

Simplified explanation:
When you created your bitcoin wallet, 2 inter-related numbers were created. These were your public key (your bitcoin address), and your private key.
They are created at the same time (actually one is derived from the other), and they have a special relationship to each other. The public key can be given out freely (hence the name), and the private key can be used to sign transactions that mathematically prove you created the public key (and therefore control the bitcoin at that address), because of the relationship between the numbers.

Are you in the US? If so, your best options are Gemini, or GDAX (Coinbase). Both are US-based and comply with all regulations in their state. Gemini is NY-based and was founded by the Winklevoss twins (Facebook). 
You should have no problem converting Bitcoin to cash, and wiring out of either. By all means, talk to a tax accountant though. That's what I did. 
You could split up the transactions into smaller amounts to prevent 1 problem transaction from holding your entire balance hostage, just make sure you aren't intentionally sizing the withdrawals to under 10k, which might be seen as structuring and is illegal.

There are definitely ways the trezor could be compromised, and there is some trust everyone who buys a trezor is placing in the manufacturer, there's no way around that. 
Even if you are able to view the code, compile it yourself and put it on the device, the manufacturer could still theoretically have code in the silicon that weakened or otherwise compromised the security of the keys it generates. i.e. they could manipulate random number generation

Sigh, I was in the 1/1,000,000 club. Now I'm in the 1/3,000,000 club -- still not bad. Especially considering I bought once, in 2011, and paid $250

Obviously this would just be speculation, but what are your thoughts on the futures market's short- to mid-term effect on the price of Bitcoin? I've read informed opinions on each side. 
Some saying upwards price pressure due to a lack of Bitcoin in the coffers of those who might otherwise short, and some saying this recent price action is institutional investors loading up  to short come December.

Here's an article explaining his thinking:

You shouldn't need to. Try the suggestion in the 3rd post on this thread, by user HCP:
Make sure when you edit the shortcut that you leave the electrum version number to the version you have installed. All you should be changing is the --testnet at the end of the shortcut target.

Use a segwit paper wallet so they don't get hammered with fees when sending in the future!

Use testnet. You can easily create a testnet wallet in Copay, and get a couple testnet Bitcoin for free from a faucet.

I think this could really make the price... tank.

Not sure what's going on. You could try on Linux if you have a spare machine (probably a good idea for your real Electrum wallet to be on Linux anyway). Alternately, you could download Copay from the Android or iOS or Chrome stores, create a new wallet, and enable "testnet" when creating the wallet, and you'll have a testnet wallet in Copay.

Sorry about that. It let me read it the first time I visited because I found it via google search. 
If you search google for "interactive brokers founder fears bitcoin futures", the first result is the full article.

As long as we split up immediately because I'm embarrassed of you son.

Probably worth playing around in the same wallet you will eventually use to store your purchased Bitcoin. What OS are you running Electrum on?
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:54:30
I'll answer your questions. 
No single entity is setting Bitcoin's price, it is decided by the market. When you say no one is going to buy a Bitcoin for $10k, that is demonstrably and probably false. The fact that people are buying 1 Bitcoin for 10k on the open market is the reason the price hit 10k.
When you say, "there's not a single time where it would be better to have 1 Bitcoin over,$10,000 actual dollars", that is provably and demonstrably false. For one, the price of Bitcoin is now pushing 11k, so there's that. If I asked you, would you rather have $10k cash, or another highly liquid asset worth some multiple of 10k, which would you pick?
Look at the handful of failing economies around the world. In Venezuela they are experiencing so much inflation, their paycheck might have 20% less buying power on Tuesday than it did on Monday. People are storing their wealth in Bitcoin to insulate it from bad monetary policy, and because Bitcoin isn't correlated to the stock market, and gives them more portfolio diversification. 
It's also important to realize, I'm not saying people should have 100% crypto and that it should completely replace all forms of money. Just that a small holding of Bitcoin as part of a larger diversified portfolio including stocks, bonds, real estate, etc, is more diversified than it otherwise would be. This alone justifies a value much higher than it currently sits at, given the relatively small supply of Bitcoin and the enormous growing demand.

Lol, same situation with my co-workers. I've been talking about it for years! Derision and ridicule all-around for a loooong time, but no longer.
My total investment in BTC was $250, in 2011 I believe. Bought ~20 btc in total, at an average price of $12.50 / coin. I even got 2 bitcoin at $2 each, at the bottom of that dip following the ~$35 bubble. It was just $4 of change left in my trading account, from my "big" purchase of $246, lol.. Wife even gave me hell about spending the $250.
I've held on to 9 of those original 20 coins, through all the ups and down. Feels good, although there's always that inner voice nagging, "you should have bought more!".
@_date: 2017-10-20 22:18:20
Oh, there's a decent amount of that, but it's all good natured. I've helped quite a few buy over the intervening years as they've come around to the idea.
