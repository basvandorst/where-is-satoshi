Yeah guys let's do nothing to stand for our values because it's useless to take action! ... We don't need that attitude dude. The world needs more action against shit we don't want, not less. And it does work.

“The Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) understands that a vast majority of middle-class Canadians pay their fair share, but it remains committed to ensuring that without exception, every taxpayer abides by the same tax laws. " That's a nice joke - tax the rich abusing tax Havens and loopholes!

Almost everyone has to exit back to fiat so the fees saved are mostly not worth the hassle of buying BTC. At least not for small amounts. For big amounts where you don't have options like transfer wise I can see it being good if your exchanges and deposit options are good.

It's a mental shortcut to make it easier for everyone to understand the situation. No one is saying it's the same thing.

In the meantime rich white collar criminals that launder money and destroy economies get nothing.

Lol you seem to think the people who run the Fed and the big banks are not corrupt corporate puppets. How cute. People in power often sell people's lives for profit every day.

The problem with that bias view is that almost everyone thinks Bitcoin is useless and/or a scam and/or it's too difficult to use. I see the value but a lot of people really don't care about what it can do. In the future, as some governments get more radicalized due to increasing social and environmental pressure I do believe these views will change - but only in some parts of the world where censorship will become an issue. The benefits for most end user right now are very slim. Adoption as been almost entirely for speculative reasons.
Note that I'm not disagreeing with the view that Bitcoin is severely undervalued vs other networks/currencies. I'm just saying it will take years and years to realize it's full value.

There's more debt in the world than there is money printed. It's a ponzi.

There's also no reason to spend any unless you're buying drugs online.

Not completely true, some miners invested so much in their space and hardware they might as well keep going even at a loss for a while.
