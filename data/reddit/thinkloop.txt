Bitcoin is regulated implicitly, like everything else. For example you have to pay taxes on it, just like if you were bonused a vacation or car, you can't aide terror organizations with it, same as if you tried to send them a computer or food, etc. It's also subject to money transmitting laws, which is why coinbase requires identity, as do the ATM  machines that are popping up. It has not been deemed a "currency" yet, so it does not have those regulations, nor advantages. Regulations on bitcoin do exist, and more will come, enforcement is a different issue though.
&lt;/end of US-centric post&gt;

Yes! That does it. Not easy to find, thanks!

mycelium doesn't seem to support xpub or watch-only mode? It just wants the master pass phrase
@_date: 2016-03-02 18:03:52
That's *exactly* what I want to do.
So I need something to generate the HD wallet, this loks best from my tests: 
The next piece of the puzzle is to be able to monitor incoming funds using the *master public key* so I don't have to manually manage different addresses. The link you provided requires a specific address (like every other site). I haven't been able to find a tool that monitors master public addresses.
@_date: 2016-03-02 14:29:14
Actually it seems sentinel doesn't monitor master public keys, I don't see any transactions I made to addresses generated form it.
@_date: 2016-03-02 18:13:34
Wow it worked! Very painful process tho :) It was complaining about the master pub being lvl 4 when it is looking for lvl 3 - had to manually adjust the derivation path to: `m/44'/0'/0'` at

I am looking to make a non-spending, secure, cold/savings wallet. I will transfer funds from there to my hardware wallet for spending. 
Hardware wallets are prone to damage, have to be connected to a computer (virus machine) at some point, harder to copy, harder to backup to multiple places, depend on electronics, etc.
@_date: 2016-03-02 18:17:01
I just understood what you meant by account-level xpubs and m/44'/0'/0', it works now!
@_date: 2017-03-28 17:20:20
That's very helpful thanks. However I don't get this:


Why after 10 minutes, are the two blocks of 5 minutes not equal to the one block of 10 minutes? Wouldn't rbf be irrelevant after 1 confirmation in either scheme?


I want it :-)


One thing I remember satoshi mentioning is having nodes in space or different planets, in which case the speed of light becomes a limiting factor.

Are you aware of the key leakage linked in the post? If you have a master public key and *any* private key *below*, you can unlock the master private key - and therefore everything below.

The code is open, kids are learning it at college, the longer bitcoin is around the more devs get interested, in the long-term the trend is downward for developer centralization.

What did he do there?!
@_date: 2017-03-20 22:35:18
1. Buy bitcoin using cash/bank (localbitcoins.com, coinbase.com etc.)
2. Have sister generate a wallet on her mobile phone (ei8ht is a nice wallet)
3. Sister sends you a receiving address from her wallet
4. You send the coins you bought to that address
5. Sister sells bitcoin for cash (localbitcoins.com, some israeli exchange, etc.)

It doesn't look like mycelium supports xpub import, nor does it have a watch-only mode. It also doesn't expose the xpub for you to copy - would have to get it from somewhere like  Wallet32 is basically identical, its a full wallet solution. Mycelium makes sense when it comes time to spend, but this is a savings wallet. 
It looks like the right solution is to generate from 
Now I just need to find a way to watch the xpub off my phone.
@_date: 2016-03-02 13:54:15
Sentinel is a great piece to the puzzle. Your generate tool is offline tho :)
@_date: 2016-03-02 18:04:36
Well done sir. I'm personally looking for a ui and mobile solution.

how will these facilitate getting fiat into the system
@_date: 2017-03-18 05:36:26


"Nope, no longer like simple, functionless gold, now we can do great things."
Is how I reddit, not sure tho

I thought hardening was meant to stop this:
The _public_ key of **public-account** is known (to generate new addresses). If the _private_ key of one of the sub addresses, like **address-1**, is revealed, can this also reveal the _private_ key of **public-account**?

How is that true? As a consumer, if you are about to make a purchase at a merchant that you haven't fully vetted, and not sure you trust, would you rather make that purchase by cc or btc?

It's not a question of due diligence, it's a question of what are they going to do with the BCC that they will implicitly get when the chain forks? If the BCC is worth $100m will they keep it for their own investments? They only got it because many people put real cash into the system. If it does have value, it is likely coming straight from BTC, which would otherwise have a higher price. I don't think they're allowed to keep the BCC whether they warn you or not, it's part of your Bitcoin investment.

Thank you, the question was mainly about a recommendation for such a wallet, I couldn't find any in the Android app store for example.
@_date: 2017-07-28 03:46:16
That's a good point - still, one of the main reasons people use coinbase is because they don't know how bitcoin really works. There's a lot of learning and potential mistakes someone can make going from coinbase to a proper wallet - especially in a rush in a couple of days. There can be an argument made that coinbase is taking advantage of those people. It would be strange if coinbase gets a free $100m out of this.

The block reward halves every 4 years, it will be insignificant in 8-12 years (1.5btc). Avg fees per block are currently around 0.3btc. The block reward is currently 12btc. To maintain the same security we have today a decade from now, Bitcoin has to appreciate 40x, or 4000%, to $100k usd per coin. Even in the unlikely event that happens, current security would not be enough for a $100k coin, because the incentive to hack it increases as it's value appreciates. Right now a large corporation or nation-state can hack Bitcoin. This is not acceptable for the world's currency.
@_date: 2017-06-23 04:49:26
Yes, that's basically what I want to do. How?
@_date: 2016-07-02 19:04:31
If $1M is  omitted every day, by the end of the first year that's $365M less in circulation, $700M less by year 2, couple of billion by the next halving, perpetually.
