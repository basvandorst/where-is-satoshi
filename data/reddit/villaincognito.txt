I didn't pick the dates - they did.  They are a sophisticated business and with their revenues, it was a drop in the bucket to honor it a few more hours like they promised.  They knew what they were getting into.  Ever heard of a "loss leader"? Sometimes companies choose to lose money on sales to gain new customers or to recoup it elsewhere. Again, this company has $3 Billion in revenues - how is 5 more hours of $75 or $150 discounts going to bankrupt them?  They chose the discount and the time frame. 
I've just never seen a company back out on their own deal, especially after I was assured at 5:40 pm that the deal would last until midnight.  If I'm wrong, I'd like to hear some examples of other companies backing out of promotions before their stated periods - because I've never seen anything like this.
I'm very surprised by those who support a company not honoring an advertised deal.

Nope. I talked to customer service and they assured me it was 11:59 PST

I wasn't going to pay with giftcards - just BTC.  That seems like a very easy scam to stop.  In the order screen, accept no gift cards - solved.
I doubt that was their problem.

I'm not just referring to the banner ads.  I had a chat with customer support at approx. 5:20 p.m. PST and she assured me the promotion lasted until 11:59 p.m. PST. 
Why put a time limit on it when the "truth" is: "Deal expires when we decide we've given enough discounts and we aren't going to tell you the numbers or how close they are to reaching their limit and we'll just cancel whenever we want."?
That doesn't sound like Sept. 1 to me.  If that makes sense to you, you have been brainwashed by whatever corporate culture cubicle you have been sitting in for too long.  Bill Clinton made more sense when he said, "it depends on what the definition of is is."
That's why the California and Federal Consumer Protection Act laws were passed, so that marketing departments can't get away with this kind of BS.
11:59 p.m. Sept. 1 is 11:59 p.m. Sept. 1 - very simple.  It does not mean "whenever we want."

Can you read?  The supplies did last.  The inventory was there.  They just chose not to honor their discounts.  Not a single TV I tried to purchase was out of stock.

How is it hypothetical?  The terms were clearly written.  If I had to spin a wheel or roll some dice to get a discount, that would be hypothetical.
Instead, I got assurance from their customer service at 5:40 pm that the promotion lasted until 11:59 pm PST.  There is nothing hypothetical about that - it was the deal they advertised all week.

Statutory damages under CA consumer protection acts.  Class action.  IAMAL, I'm not pulling stuff out of my ass like you, and most of the posters here.
Your meme is cute but it shows you have no idea what you are talking about.  You are just used to to taking whatever a corporation tells you while they jam it up your ass and you say "thank you" because you have no idea that this shit is illegal.  
Thanks for commenting though, but please go back to bitcoinbeginners or 4chan or wherever you came from because its obvious you don't know shit about consumer protection laws.  Look forward of a lifetime of being screwed, because you are very quick to bend over.

Hillary was definitely a shit candidate. Horrible mistake of the Dems to run her on the ticket because she is the only thing that could have lost that election.  Anything with a pulse and an (R) next to their name on the ballot was sufficient to beat Hillary (as may have been proven*) in this election.
*with this week's news that Russia also interfered with the UK'S Brexit vote to leave the EU, there is very little assurance anymore that the election was valid. Before you go crying that it is over, I am not calling for a recount. That time has passed and the immediate recourse is impeachment and /or arrest, which will be happening soon.
The main reason I wanted to respond a month later is that I'm sure you have seen the news this week that it was Russia who was paying people to troll for Trump. All the stories about paid liberal trolls turned out to be false. What is interesting, is that the accusations against liberals turned out to be nothing more than Republicans accusing Democrats of being as dirty as they are. Unfortunately for them, the truth is that your people had to be paid to take your side and Democrats do this out of love for country.
If you are lost in a conservative moral dilemma after learning that it was actually the Republicans who were paid Russian trolls, you can find moral guidance in the tried-and-true test of "WWJD?"  (Hint: you won't find the prosperity doctrine anywhere in the Bible and every teaching of Jesus is demonstrative  evidence that he is a Democrat.) Learn it and live it, for it is the word of God.
Prepare yourself for Trump's perp walk because it is coming soon.

Found one of Putin's paid trolls ^

Wow . . . so much stupid in this comment.  Impossible to even respond to somebody who drinks that much kool-aid.  In the long run, intelligence prevails and you people pushing the stupid this hard are going to have a hard time very soon because Trump won't last 4 years - if he is even inaugurated

I see you are a Putin-supporting traitor.  So sad.  Don't even know me, yet says stupid things.
(get it?)
