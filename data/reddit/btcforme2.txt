You are aware that there can be more than one meaning to a word, right? If you are going to correct someone, you might want to make sure that you're actually correct.

QR code will not take, no matter how hard I try.
@_date: 2015-06-10 18:15:14
Cool, when the bike is still.
@_date: 2015-06-05 20:59:50
Iv'e spent 15 minutes looking for it. Clues???
@_date: 2015-06-07 12:24:42
I would mine.
@_date: 2015-06-04 17:07:23
Where can I buy one?
@_date: 2015-06-04 17:30:28
Know your customer? How about, know your Banker?! I just used bitcoin, and It was simple and easy.
@_date: 2015-06-01 22:23:04
I started to sweat, just reading this.
@_date: 2015-06-01 15:40:07
@_date: 2015-06-12 19:55:06
I enjoyed the fast pace.
@_date: 2015-06-18 13:33:48
@_date: 2015-06-07 15:46:16
The idea of mining is romantic, yet not practical. Why did I turn a blind eye to bitcoin when I read about it years ago? Ughh!

@_date: 2015-06-30 19:10:11
Way to go NSA.
@_date: 2015-06-18 13:37:30
hmmm. Maybe, the employees of the banks could run the the nodes?
@_date: 2015-06-30 15:23:51
Sounds crazy, but this will lead to war. 
@_date: 2015-06-14 22:47:58
@_date: 2015-06-15 10:05:20
Awesome! 
@_date: 2015-06-16 22:49:57
Do you know the website? 
@_date: 2015-06-27 23:41:06
Very good looking machine. There should be a line there!
@_date: 2015-06-22 16:56:02
It was fun, I look forward to more! Thanks.

A Government actually managed to do something hip. Who would have thought?
@_date: 2015-06-27 00:07:40
I have used libertyx a bunch. I would highly recommend. Make sure that you are not charged a fee by the vender, I was charged every single time, like 2 percent by the vendor, and now I know better, but it really is a great service. 
@_date: 2015-06-16 14:21:40
@_date: 2015-06-08 16:12:17
They also have 2300 American made and paid for Humvee's, countless U.S. Currency, and many thousands of American made, late model, modified Ford trucks, Chevrolets, GMC's and Toyota's. G, I wonder. 
It's actually a testament to bitcoin's success, that it's valued across the world, be it friend or foe. 
@_date: 2015-06-12 19:11:42
It would be cool if you could make it display just your bitcoin address.
@_date: 2015-06-22 23:16:15
I hope Western Union isn't paying attention.
@_date: 2015-06-02 15:30:22

@_date: 2015-05-29 20:38:23
I downloaded, and created a new account. I'm waiting for a new qr code.
@_date: 2015-05-24 20:17:24
Imagine, lets say, I want to watch a ufc paperview fight, but I only want to watch one fight, not the whole card... Interesting.
@_date: 2015-05-21 03:46:39
Nice! 
@_date: 2015-05-29 18:38:45
If that's the case, then I could imagine those tainted coins being sold where it was legal, below the average price. It would accelerate the problem. 
@_date: 2015-05-20 14:07:55
That's about right. I wait about 2 confirmations, and it helps to engage in a little conversation first. If I sell, I never transfer my btc until after I have full cash payment first. 
@_date: 2015-05-21 15:35:13
libertyx is awesome.
@_date: 2015-05-29 19:23:43
I know this is not related but, lets say the price of bitcoin does go to a million dollars and mining becomes unbelievably hard. Wouldn't only Nation States be able to put up that much power with Nuclear powered mining?
@_date: 2015-05-29 19:40:07
@_date: 2015-05-29 21:04:48
It says, expired.
@_date: 2015-05-28 17:28:18
Couldn't have said it better.
@_date: 2015-05-26 14:45:18
It's bad for bitcoin. Settle it, stop acting like children.
@_date: 2015-05-20 17:54:29
Where? Nice!
@_date: 2015-05-29 11:04:27

@_date: 2015-05-24 19:20:55
@_date: 2015-05-19 22:15:45
Bitcoin is here to stay. I think it will eventually be utilized by the super wealthy. 
@_date: 2015-05-28 15:13:58
Nuclear powered mining.
@_date: 2015-05-19 03:30:52
The blockchain can't handle the unknown, massive amount of transactions this will bring about. What is the point? 
@_date: 2015-05-22 20:12:36
Why 105? 
@_date: 2015-05-19 09:29:06
Great point. So, are the bitcoin developers in on this?
@_date: 2015-05-24 21:14:03
Looks depressing.
@_date: 2015-05-21 18:15:43
Bitcoin needs a crisis it can fix.
@_date: 2015-05-24 19:23:31
Doing it knowing it will fail, just part of the process before they marry the blockchain. 
@_date: 2015-05-31 17:26:15

@_date: 2015-05-23 18:19:23
Good article.
@_date: 2015-05-30 17:14:27
This is bad. 
@_date: 2015-05-19 16:30:26
@_date: 2015-05-21 14:53:02
Agreed. In the future, everyone will be able to use bitcoin, but only the rich will be able to afford to own bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-05-24 23:23:43
It really is a slow night. 
@_date: 2015-05-20 17:47:01
Another centralized creation. 
@_date: 2015-05-31 17:39:01
Satoshi needs to come out of hiding, and speak.
@_date: 2015-05-19 15:35:10
I was going to go to the site, but I will never go there again because of that horrid mining advertisement they have, especially in mobile. Horrid!!! 
@_date: 2015-05-26 15:17:46
Until the big banks realize that their future will be mining.
@_date: 2015-05-19 22:01:25
Call me old school, give me a denarius.
@_date: 2015-05-23 13:57:36
I always throw praise on libertyx when I can. Awesome, easy, fast, cheap way to get bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-05-29 21:30:00
Just do it! 
@_date: 2015-08-04 23:36:04
This man must have a buzz.
@_date: 2015-08-07 14:28:13
I am a big fan of precious metals, I have been for a long time. That being said, I never thought I would prefer anything other than gold or silver, then came bitcoin. I now prefer bitcoin over metals. It baffles me. 
@_date: 2015-08-16 19:13:04
Yes, you get your receipt, that has a pin then redeem pin and send to your bitcoin address. When I tried to get my first bitcoins, I felt like slamming my head into a wall. 
@_date: 2015-08-03 19:08:41
Interesting. Japan makes things that people want. I only buy Japanese auto's for example.
@_date: 2015-08-05 00:22:47
That is what I'm wondering. 
@_date: 2015-08-05 00:19:35
@_date: 2015-08-18 05:27:13
Satoshi does not give a shit. 
@_date: 2015-08-17 21:12:34
I completely agree.

@_date: 2015-08-09 17:54:47
Serious cockblockers on the financial level.
@_date: 2015-08-12 11:58:41
I was thinking, augur, or something like it. It's a shame, all the scamming going on.
@_date: 2015-08-09 14:10:04
Scared the crap out of me! 
@_date: 2015-08-16 22:12:40
I know! Geeks can be quite mean. You seem to have a decent grasp of bitcoin. It  took me like a week, reading everything I could get my hands on just to wrap my head around it.
@_date: 2015-08-16 18:52:53
I'm sorry, it can be frustrating for sure. I usually just use LibertyX, very fast, very simple. 
@_date: 2015-08-17 16:39:03
Should be a button for sideways.
@_date: 2015-08-16 00:32:41
Whoa! 
@_date: 2015-08-14 10:47:11
It's 80 percent China, 20 percent whale.
@_date: 2015-08-05 03:56:45
Where is this well written software? Did you see it? 
@_date: 2015-08-18 05:31:26
If it did, it would have given proof, and it would have spoken as the measured, sensible creature it pretended to be from day one. 
@_date: 2015-08-10 03:39:13
Most times, rural Northwest China.
@_date: 2015-08-18 06:28:18
I see my comments got slutted down. Blythe Masters was right when she recently stated that this space was inundated with super smart people, many of whom have libertarian leanings, that they are actually working for the the fiat banks, the very folks who will eventually use all this tech.
@_date: 2015-08-18 05:36:58
And remember, it's whatever works first, that is what will be utilized by the fiat Gods. Bitcoin is like a matchbox car showing up at a bus stop. Scale or die.  
@_date: 2015-08-16 17:24:32
I am making good use of the hide button though.
@_date: 2015-08-04 19:02:00
I see some .0005 percent fees. Is that normal?
@_date: 2015-08-11 19:02:47
That is nuts!
@_date: 2015-08-14 18:21:51
So they can eat great food and earn a nice salary, until the money runs out.
@_date: 2015-08-10 03:32:29
This is good for bitcoin, although it hurts at the moment. If they want to stifle themselves, so be it. Thank God, there are other places on earth to do business.
@_date: 2015-08-09 17:50:02
Whatever they say, do the opposite.
@_date: 2015-07-27 18:59:00
Dang! 40, wow.
@_date: 2015-07-20 00:08:33
That is funny. I remember using money orders years ago.
@_date: 2015-07-17 23:41:23
Circle. Ever since they failed with their 5 dollar sign up reward, I avoid using them.
@_date: 2015-08-07 14:32:21
@_date: 2015-07-31 19:22:20
Wonder why?
@_date: 2015-07-24 22:16:08
That's brutal. I'm very sorry.
@_date: 2015-08-03 18:16:14
@_date: 2015-08-04 23:58:56
no sound!
@_date: 2015-08-05 00:26:09
Sounded like the twins for a minute, like he'd get in trouble.
@_date: 2015-08-12 03:24:32
Should be Igoturmetals. I'm really sorry for your situation. Not good. 
@_date: 2015-08-09 17:52:16
I have often wondered that myself.
@_date: 2015-08-05 00:25:22
I gagged when he said that.
@_date: 2015-08-16 19:16:20
Also, you might want to download a wallet, I have an android phone, Mycelium works great and also has a feature that allows you to buy or sell, but I haven't used that yet.
@_date: 2015-08-18 06:39:00
If Snowden is safe, surely, Satoshi could send a harmless e-mail, followed with a transaction involving any of his original addresses. 
@_date: 2015-07-11 21:49:06
I'm thinking of betting. Does anyone know how high I need to make the miner fee? I don't want my bet held up...
@_date: 2015-07-16 17:28:20
The first bank that uses bitcoin directly, will have a massive competitive advantage over their lethargic peers. 
@_date: 2015-08-12 03:37:50
I hope in the future, there exists a reputation/trust algorithm, that these parties can never rip off again, and that they are fully discredited from scamming again. What a privilege, to have the chance to be an innovator, with streams of bitcoin, still coming in, and you choose to run away with profits. Shame on you! Shame, a thousand times!
@_date: 2015-08-05 04:00:01
This whole charade has been vague as shit. Ok, we are going to change everything, we are going to innovate, disrupt, level the playing field, but you cannot know the mechanism that we will utilize, to do this. 
@_date: 2015-07-17 23:32:24
Very Nice! America and Europe seem to dominate.
@_date: 2015-07-02 18:16:06
Another thing, why don't you prepare your people for the war that will happen as a result of this mess?
@_date: 2015-07-11 22:28:13
Thanks! Also, I'm thinking of using mycelium for the first time. Do you know if that will allow you to adjust above the minimum? I rarely bet, but I want to make sure it gets confirmed quickly. 
@_date: 2015-07-17 12:41:54
@_date: 2015-08-16 16:56:06
Very interesting.  
@_date: 2015-07-14 06:42:41
Seems legit. 
@_date: 2015-07-16 12:06:58
" Looking at blockchain technology " = Looking at every possible way to take advantage of bitcoin, without actually using bitcoin. lol!

LibertyX dude.
@_date: 2015-07-09 19:36:35
I just received an e-mail from blockchain.info saying " transaction confirmation failed" . At the time, I did not have the option to raise the fee. This spamming crap is very annoying.
@_date: 2015-07-13 16:54:04
LibertyX is awesome. Do you mean pin?
@_date: 2015-07-17 00:22:40
Most likely, the people giving you the pin number, probably don't know what bitcoin is, no need for them to know. Libertyx is awesome. They never ask me for identification.
@_date: 2015-07-17 19:15:16
Nitrogen. So easy, super fast.
@_date: 2015-07-14 06:41:36
I don't think he took a swig because he was thirsty, more like a " wtf " break.
@_date: 2015-08-15 22:51:46
Don't feel too bad, I offered 50 bucks to a friend if he installed a wallet, and he just stared at me like a deer in headlights. 
@_date: 2015-07-08 16:06:27
@_date: 2015-07-08 15:22:03
I have been waiting for 3 transactions to confirm for about 20 hours, it's only a small total amount, but it's very annoying.
@_date: 2015-07-08 12:14:43
The Greek people may not have cash, but they do have things, which they can and will sell for bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-07-12 00:15:29
I just placed my bet with nitrogen, I used Mycelium for the first time, and I hit priority, which is .0002 and it worked like a breeze!
@_date: 2015-07-27 17:24:20
" infrastructure is already in place " That is HUGE!
@_date: 2015-07-06 22:01:33
The " worlders" will make sure Greeks starve. So sad.
@_date: 2015-07-24 00:17:36
@_date: 2015-07-30 21:32:50
Well said.
@_date: 2015-07-09 19:45:03
Yes, I want to say 2 days, maybe less. 
@_date: 2015-08-05 00:20:26
Are they building this on top of the bitcoin network?
@_date: 2015-07-13 04:49:23
oh no, please, not this guy...sigh.
@_date: 2015-07-16 17:11:16
So True!
@_date: 2015-07-14 03:39:17
There should be one for the r/bitcoin people. I'd play.
@_date: 2015-07-08 03:45:26
Great! F' China!
@_date: 2015-08-15 22:47:57
That is bait, trying to force a genuine response.

He is looking at bitcoin as nothing but a currency. The laughter in the audience was depressing.
@_date: 2015-07-01 21:16:07
I'm in...  
@_date: 2015-07-14 16:11:26
Good answer! I new his question wasn't completely weird, I think he just got really nervous or something. 
@_date: 2015-07-16 12:04:40

I was fooled, for about 4 seconds. 
@_date: 2015-03-18 19:52:41

That is torture man! Forget about it...
@_date: 2015-03-30 19:36:03
A communal phone would have to be smuggled in and hidden, but that wouldn't be a problem, seeing that it benefits all of the inmates and would allow a banking terminal inside.

Bitcoin atm's always look so darn ugly.
@_date: 2015-03-04 20:43:53
Is this in Pa area? 
@_date: 2015-03-05 03:24:20
I agree.
@_date: 2015-03-11 08:51:25
I am fascinated with these situations. I can't see how they break down, or what will happen, but my eyes are wide open for sure.
@_date: 2015-03-17 10:16:59
I think this is severely inaccurate. 
@_date: 2015-03-23 17:51:26
Very nice. I really love the zeroblock widget myself.
@_date: 2015-03-13 20:07:54
Can't wait to try this.
@_date: 2015-03-10 20:04:36
I just gave myself a hug.
@_date: 2015-03-17 20:10:38
I agree.

I'm in philly area and I have used libertyx and had great experience. Localbitcoins is pretty good, but it's just too risky for me.
@_date: 2015-03-21 10:57:56
That worked man! took longer, but it worked!
@_date: 2015-03-11 10:09:49
She is basically building a private sidechain for inter-bank transfers. She already stated that she could care less about the liberty dynamics that bitcoin offers.
@_date: 2015-03-08 14:17:51
@_date: 2015-03-08 07:38:18
Thank you!
@_date: 2015-03-10 07:08:01

Sell one or some to him, p2p. 
@_date: 2015-02-08 00:26:05
I brushed btc off when I first heard of it. What a mistake! When I got around to reading more about it, I watched about 80 hours almost non-stop tutorials on btc. I sometimes find myself thinking about the ( what ifs) but that is life! I think everybody has a decent opportunity to get in now.
@_date: 2015-03-24 14:41:41
Any live links?
@_date: 2015-03-17 10:25:50
I hope bitcoin takes off in Africa, but deep down, I am cynical about it all.
@_date: 2015-03-13 03:58:37
nahh. Look at yahoo or google.
@_date: 2015-03-15 22:19:42
I can see it now, a trezor shank.
@_date: 2015-03-27 03:55:21
I want a orange bracelet, that says " bitcoin strong" .
@_date: 2015-03-12 01:10:43
@_date: 2015-03-21 01:07:23
That needs a bitcoin sticker on it.
@_date: 2015-03-18 19:58:13
Is that Gold?
@_date: 2015-03-21 23:42:55
This must be jest. 
@_date: 2015-02-18 04:01:55
All of these companies will be dead in a year.
@_date: 2015-03-27 05:45:49

@_date: 2015-02-19 12:48:50
I read the comments. How is it possible, ignorance on mass scale. lol..
@_date: 2015-03-24 14:55:08
SMH. Ass.
@_date: 2015-02-10 16:04:42
I don't believe it.
@_date: 2015-02-18 12:21:32
bitcoin is successful because of what it is, not because coinbase comes along. 
@_date: 2015-02-11 19:57:20
libertx. It's so easy. 
@_date: 2015-02-11 19:59:51
I can imagine, when or if bitcoin explodes, that there would exist a place where two people can go and not be able to leave until both parties were satisfied with the transaction. 
@_date: 2015-02-07 00:49:43
I used libertyx, it's actually available at a kiosk in the local mall and it was fast and easy! 
@_date: 2015-02-27 22:26:20
Stoned, drunk? I think not. 
@_date: 2015-02-08 01:03:47
I can't quite figure out how to collect..
@_date: 2015-03-17 04:10:20
Going to dump my xrp asap.
@_date: 2015-02-18 04:02:16
btc will live.
@_date: 2015-02-14 15:42:46
I would think they have gps?
@_date: 2015-02-19 01:26:43
Great possibility for a company to make a commercial without any words. Just show a dude getting fleeced at western union after working his balls off in some hot field. Then show him using btc.
@_date: 2015-02-08 01:00:07
@_date: 2015-02-25 10:10:24
Let me get this straight...They actually want to hire someone that is naive. 
@_date: 2015-02-21 15:08:03
bitcoin is genius.
@_date: 2015-03-11 11:10:13
@_date: 2015-03-08 14:14:34
That was horribly painful to read. The article just stopped abruptly.
@_date: 2015-02-27 23:40:57
It's a male dominated space, it's also an elephant in the room. 
@_date: 2015-02-18 04:08:45
The company should be named, Coinsuckuptogovandrotbecausewedontreallyunderstandbtc.
@_date: 2015-02-11 19:46:32
I would expect Satoshi is still very much involved in bitcoin, unbeknownst to everyone.
@_date: 2015-03-05 01:19:16
7 btc in a hot wallet?
@_date: 2015-02-26 19:43:29
All I hear is how important the next big app is going to be, but what is just as important is marketing at some level. 10,000 coders working across the board is great, but bitcoin is still only really of interest to people that in general are thinkers. 
@_date: 2015-02-08 13:17:01
The Greek finance minister already spoke of his disdain for bitcoin. The people of Greece need to adopt bitcoin for themselves. No need for centralized approval.
@_date: 2015-03-03 23:03:42
Just elevator music thus far..
@_date: 2015-02-12 00:19:58
I went to mall kiosk, using libertyx services and it was very fast and easy. I spoke at length to the teller, who had no idea what bitcoin was. Seeing that her native country was in the third world, I took the opportunity to discuss the benefits of sending money back to her family, without having to pay Western Piss-union a hefty fee. It felt a little bit sketchy, but I thoroughly enjoyed the experience. Next up will, be getting a bumper sticker with a btc address, maybe I will get tips!
@_date: 2015-03-18 20:23:02
MY opinion: btc and dark survive. 
@_date: 2015-03-03 14:10:30
@_date: 2015-03-22 04:27:03
I bet he has bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-02-27 12:15:38
If all goes well, banks will be the sidechains.
@_date: 2015-02-24 18:39:07
@_date: 2015-02-10 14:33:05
Very neat! 
@_date: 2015-02-10 14:35:24
Last week my wallet showed a negative balance. It's fine now but I was amused.
@_date: 2015-02-07 00:38:23
The regulation aspect amuses me. I think that those first places to try regulation, will only exclude themselves from innovation and the inevitable dominance of the block chain space. 
@_date: 2015-02-28 04:33:12
Sure. 
@_date: 2015-02-08 13:59:14
I use my phone and I have the blockchain wallet. I go to address book then to scan watch only address and bam, there it is with a little eye showing the balance.
@_date: 2015-02-19 01:21:18
There are endless commercial possibilities. Great idea. Crowd fund for btc commercials?
@_date: 2015-02-20 11:46:24
What a waste of a good mind. Devoted to the legacy system. 
@_date: 2015-03-25 19:38:54
Great idea!

Put them on paper wallets, your wife will get really interested in them someday.
@_date: 2015-02-11 19:58:10
Surely, you must know a person that lives close by a libertyx location?
@_date: 2015-02-27 21:53:08
Because they are slightly more than half the population.
@_date: 2015-02-22 15:27:58
bitcoin would need to be renamed, bit-key. 
@_date: 2015-02-11 22:07:41
Take a look at the satoshi round table group photo, no indigenous people in that picture, but I get what it says.
@_date: 2015-02-10 19:19:17
@_date: 2015-02-11 20:17:26
Cool! I bought my first bitcoin a while back and struggled between, local bitcoins/in person or libertyx and i chose liberty. It was easy, but I was a bit nervous at first.
@_date: 2015-02-12 04:22:18
mine had a negative btc balance, i enjoyed the glitch.
@_date: 2015-02-23 19:19:29
What a joke! 
@_date: 2015-02-14 13:55:54
LOL! I would be more concerned with all those new, shiny, american trucks they drive around in. How did they get those?
@_date: 2015-02-09 03:45:53
Bitcoin only businesses in all high population areas. I'm dreaming.
@_date: 2015-02-19 15:39:45
The train is leaving the station and these people have no idea!
@_date: 2015-02-08 04:42:14
Thank you so much!
@_date: 2015-02-14 20:58:19
We could all, crowd fund commercials?
@_date: 2015-02-20 17:33:00
The citizens of Greece can though. That is what matters, that there is an option for the citizens. 
@_date: 2015-02-10 14:43:51
Well said! I have been tempted with Litecoin, but I know what party I want to go to, and its BTC!
@_date: 2015-02-28 00:22:57
What force are you referring to? Why the attitude?
@_date: 2015-02-19 20:28:36
It should be recognizable within 3-10 seconds, however, yes waiting for confirmations is still the way it is.  9 minutes per block right this sec.
@_date: 2015-02-08 13:28:02
Most people have no clue what bitcoin is. 
@_date: 2015-02-11 13:01:06
What s stupid article! 
@_date: 2015-02-14 15:07:12
This is a good tutorial on cold wallets.  
@_date: 2015-02-08 15:55:45
I think they all do.
@_date: 2015-02-13 19:37:00
btc will shoot up and big dollars will still come in to buy. 
@_date: 2015-02-07 23:08:29
When using bitcoin is just as easy as using email, then you will get mass usage. 
@_date: 2015-02-18 12:32:16
Don't use coinbase. 
@_date: 2015-02-12 17:03:04

One doesn't need to be a genius to know when something is genius.
