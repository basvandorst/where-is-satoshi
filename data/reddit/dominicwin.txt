Learned about reddit through Bitcoin. Glad to join the Bitcoin discussion on more than one forum. Been a Bitcoin investor since 2011.

New to reddit through bitcointalk. I've been a bitcoin investor since 2011 and building up more by selling Cubans!

These are all Cuban brands and Cuban produced cigars.

Cubans range in price and are known to be the best in the world, but only illegal in one country. Some of the most coveted ones would be the Siglo VI and the Behike line. Those you will find wealthy people smoking them in fancy cigar lounges all over the world. The Siglo VI is actually my favorite above all.

thanks for the recommendation. I'll take a look at that.

Wasn't sure how technical of a response you were looking for. There's all sorts of variations of Tobacco, leaves used, wrappers, aging, construction. No one in the world will ever compare a $10 cigar smoking side by side to lets say the Siglo VI or the Behike 54. The status you are talking about really only applies to Americans because of the allure of the forbidden fruit. Even within a single Cuban cigar brand there is going to be variation of quality from cheaper Cubans to the more expensive completely hand constructed cigars using aged wrappers and specific kinds of tobaccos. It's like creating a fine Wine. It's an art. Probably one of the most entertaining things to do is to introduce someone to a nice Cuban who has been smoking non Cuban cigars and see their amazed reactions.
