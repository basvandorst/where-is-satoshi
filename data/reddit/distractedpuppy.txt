We will probably start at somewhere between 0.001 and 0.005 BTC initially. This equates to a couple of USDs. After we have paid off development costs we may very well lower the listing price. 
Thanks for the input!

We tried to come up with something creative that did not have "Bit" in the domain name. Many sites that have bit in the name tend to be gimmicks or end up failing. We wanted to give this site a name that would stick out among the various companies rushing to the cliche' names.
Thanks For the Recommendations!

           This promotion does not require you to pay any Bitcoin and is being offered by the developers of the site. The site is based out of Charleston, SC, USA and was only recently launched a week ago as a beta. We need to let people know about it. If you are interested in trying it for free for yourself and don't want to promote it through this promotion feel free to list free using the voucher code: 41848c7579e2 which is valid as an introductory free listing since we do not currently have the volume to justify charging for listings. All we ask in return is you come back and post honest criticisms or things that you liked so we can make the site better!

So let me share the distractedpuppy business model with you. The concept for distractedpuppy is that it will be developed in time by the Distractedpuppy community under the moderation of the DistractedPuppy team. We want to give you a product that you actually find useful. This is the initial beta testing of our product. We have created a site where one can successfully , register, negotiate and buy items from other users using Bitcoins. As use increases we will increase the security measures and validations associated with the site. In other words, the current use does not justify an SSL certificate but it will be added later. 
       The design and aesthetics will also improve with use and time. As per international customers we do intend for the site to be multi-national. We have been considering revising our motto "Leave The Dolalrs At Home". It was originally picked due to the common use of the "Dollar" in most of our targeted countries. However, we can see how this would certainly come across as being specific to the United States and may change with the next version. 
Thanks for the recommendations,

       Yes, we have to post somewhat regularly for those who have not seen the announcement yet. We'll try to keep it to a minimum.

Thank You for the recommendations and support. This sort of conversation is exactly what we need to improve the product. (Believe me we don't post things like this on reddit not expecting criticism)
We are considering lowering the listing fees when we end the free promotion as well. Currently its set at 0.01BTC per a listing which is rather high (but we are currently limited by our script). We are considering lowering the fee down to 0.005BTC per a listing in the future.
