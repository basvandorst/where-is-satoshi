Tried to tie my credit accounts but it said my address was wrong for all accounts.  They couldn't offer support at all.  Yes, I have excellent credit.

I can reverse charges on my credit accounts a lot easier than from a checking account.  This is common knowledge.  Same reason I never use a debit/check card for any purchases.

I'm happy that Coinbase is helping all these retailers accept BTC transactions.  With that said, when will they get their consumer side of the house in order?  I've had multiple purchases randomly canceled, labeled "high risk," never received responses to support cases, been unable to tie credit accounts, and so on.  I'm not the only one experiencing these issues.
Edit: I've had more purchases (from Coinbase) canceled than actually completed.  That says something.

You've got a point.  I see so many ridiculous ChangeTips.  Why would someone waste their time to claim $0.10?

My comment was obviously aimed at non-bitcoiners.

Banks.  I have several of them.  Credit unions and normal.  It doesn't matter.  I see the funds get placed on hold.  Let me be very clear: my banks aren't canceling the transactions.  Got it?
Edit: Pro-Coinbase downvote brigade is here!
Since you fools have nothing better to do, I link you the Coinbase [subreddit]( for your viewing pleasure.  Enjoy your terrible service, folks!

I usually make a point of spending all my foreign coins on beer before I leave the country.  Leftover coins then get handed out to children of my friends.

No one wants to go there anymore.

Just what a Khan would say!!! The documentary about the USS Enterprise taught us to never trust a Khan.

No thanks.

Pretty sure he's copying out of a calculus book.

I read all of those chat logs (regarding the hitman for hire) and it seems like he was scammed by the same people that were trying to extort him(FriendlyChemist).  Ross is a moron.

All decent subreddits eventually switch to self posts only.  It wards off the typical karma whoring nonsense.  I'm sorry but I don't like classic memes being associated with my virtual currency discussions.

It sounds like the seller would have been perfectly fine with OP losing his deposit.  I bet this isn't the first time they have done such things.

Would coins be blacklisted if they come from other cryptocurrency exchanges?  I could easily just trade my "bad" coins for a number of LTC or other altcoins and then buy back "good" coins.  One side effect is this would boost the value of LTC.

It was an honest question.  No need to be a dick.
Thanks for not answering nor contributing to the conversation.

Ugh, that's a dreary possibility if these people get their way.  Thanks for the reply!

I have never heard anyone refer to bitcoiners as neckbeards.

My credit union just canceled two coinbase purchases.  I'm still waiting for word as to why.  They previously allowed me to purchase coins when they were under $200.
