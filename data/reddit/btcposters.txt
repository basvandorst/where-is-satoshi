Thanks for your feedback. We agree with you.
The problem is that most of the payment processors like coinbase want people to give up their bank account and real world identity in order to use them. We didn't want to do that at this stage as this was just a small experiment to try to have fun with Bitcoin and make something nice.
I don't suppose you know of any payment solutions or ways we can do this that don't involve giving up your identity to third parties. One of our favourite things about bitcoin is that that it's more like cash and less like traditional banking institutions.
We don't have the programming know how to automatically generate different bitcoin addresses through the site... do you know an easy way to do such a thing?

Our idea was that it was a playful parody as we're very excited about the idea of bitcoin as a way to circumvent fake hope-peddlers like Obama. Thank you for your feedback though. We hope to make more posters in the future and hopefully those will interest you more!

Thanks. This is a very good criticism which we hadn't considered. As a temporary solution (until we work out how to do a more professional payment mechanism) we've reversed the instructions. We now ask people to:
1. Fill in the form stating their bitcoin address.
2. And then send the bitcoin.
In this way only the genuine buyer can be credited with the sale as their confirmation message will be the only one timestamped before the bitcoin transaction.

Hi there,
Glad you like our poster! We've reversed the instructions on the site now so we ask people to first fill in the form and THEN send the payment. That way you can be sure nobody will piggypack off your payment as your message will be the only one timestamped *before* the payment came in.
Alternatively, if you still have concerns, you can send us a private message here on Reddit and we could work something else out.

Thank you so much. Going to try this immediately.

Yeah, you might be right there. We understand what you're saying.
Our existing business is just that: a normal business.
This wasn't intended as a business thing at all. We wanted to make something for the community and then exchange it into a few bitcoin which we could then play with anonymously.
But you make a good point and the truth is we probably shouldn't have mentioned our existing history if we weren't going to link them together. We did it to add some credibility but in fact you're right--it's irrelevant as we are distributing this through a self-contained page.
We've had a few sales now so once those buyers receive their items safely that should create some credibility in the community.
If it raises red flags that's a pity but I can see that it might. Truth is its the anonymity of bitcoin which is what is exciting these two aging libertarians.

Hi, thanks for your feedback.
Firstly, to say it reeks of his poster is sort of to imply it wasn't intentional but the first text on our page is "Designed as a playful take on the Obama Hope posters from 2008. It’s time to subvert the political mainstream with a radical spin on an iconic design. ".
Secondly, it is definitely supposed to be ironic. We were hoping for a *subversive parody* of that poster. The idea is that Obama is the opposite of hope but that Bitcoin truly could "change" the world in a positive way.
Perhaps our work has come across as supporting Obama in some way. Nothing could be further from the truth. We're both actually libertarian anarchists.

Thank you, that's really kind of you to say :)

Thank you for your positive words; they really helped :)
Do you know any services which will streamline our payment process which don't require giving them your name / bank account details etc. We feel like the main exciting thing about bitcoin payments was that they can be made online between parties without the traditional identify-yourself-to-the-man reality of bank transfers.
This was just a small hobby project for us. Not really to make profits but rather to make something for the community and hopefully in the process earn us some bitcoins to play with.

Thank you for your feedback we really appreciate it. Definitely didn't aim to appear to be endorsing Obama at all. Our goal was to parody that poster. To subvert mainstream politics with a bitcoin message.
Hopefully our future posters can build on this criticism and be received more positively :)

If you purchase a print I'd be happy to email you the high resolution source file in addition to sending out the 12x8 poster. You could then use that to order enlargements at a more local print shop if you wanted to.

Hey, thanks a lot. We're really excited that despite the generally negative consensus a few people have purchased the poster :) This gives us the confidence to carry on and make more posters. We'll also try to iron out the payment process moving forwards.
Thanks again. Poster will be mailed out tomorrow.

Yeah you're right. We were going for the parody but "PLAN B" may have been an improvement. Judging from the majority of comments it seems people would have preferred something else.
Thanks for your feedback.
