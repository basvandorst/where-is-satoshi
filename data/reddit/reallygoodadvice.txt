DAE LYRICS??

Judge for yourself. If you can't, don't invest until you're confident.

Thank you.

Exactly. Look at Mastercoin.
@_date: 2014-01-26 17:51:47
Because most transactions are tiny fractions of a coin. You could have different colors represent different denominations maybe though (gold for BTC, silver for mBTC, bronze for nBTC).

TX malleability is an unsolvable "issue" because the signature can't include the signature script itself for obvious reasons. Fuck gox for making everyone think otherwise.
@_date: 2014-03-21 20:55:55
Like this? 
@_date: 2014-01-26 21:06:26
I support this idea
@_date: 2014-01-01 17:17:12
PoS mining. Peercoin, for example.

This is a huge fucking deal. Do we REALLY need there to be a catastrophe before people listen?

Wikipedia is hardly decentralized, but I like your spirit

Transaction malleability is not going to be "fixed", it is not an error. You cannot have a signature contain itself, except in theory the same way you can crack a private key in theory. Fuck gox for spreading such FUD.

Invictus is a company that builds DACs, which stands for Decentralized Autonomous Company. Basically, profitable applications of the blockchain, like a p2p exchange and a namecoin alternative that is actually profitable for shareholders

rptiela (w/e the fuck his username is) from the bitcointalk forums actually has a pretty decent methodology for estimating bitcoin users / holders. Notice how you assumed the chart was talking about addresses but there were no labels on the axes =P

Just so you know from the average end-user's perspective "the client-side code will not upload your keys to our server" is exactly as trustworthy as "we will keep your keys very safe when you upload them to our server". Most people don't know how to monitor the console for network traffic or manually disable internet and clear browser files while using the site, they are still placing their trust with you.

I hadn't thought of that, that's quite interesting. IIRC Peercoin uses a hybrid PoW/PoS method, I imagine if your mining "power" was determined by some better-than-linear combination of these it would be in your best interest to mine a particular chain
@_date: 2014-03-22 03:12:42
Didn't know about it! Which came first?

I wish this would speed up, two different divisions in my compnay which I sold on the Bitcoin vision in the last year or so recently switched to ethereum because of "technical advantages". What does that even mean? Ugh...

Sorry for sounding like a prick but you are a fucking idiot for writing this (well, for publishing it like that). Not only are you giving bitcoin a really bad name, but your guide doesn't even ensure that anyone following your it is actually anonymous or secure. I hope you make a killing off of ad revenue for this misleading and potentially damaging article. Not that you don't have every right to do so.

"Anonymous and untraceable".
UGH! NO!
