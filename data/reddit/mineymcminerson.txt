Are you kidding?
(Either total shill or not understanding what this thread is about...)
"7) What do we need verification for?
Verification of all Qvolta users is an important security measure to avoid fraud."

What are you guys talking about?  If you want to use an iTunes gift card then yes, you're losing half the value right off the top due to crazy fees.  For cash deposit, W Union or meeting in person the fees are anywhere from 1-10%.
Also, you see better "deals" from sellers after you've had a few trades. And, by not selecting a specific dollar amount up front.  If you put in say, $250 there may be a better offer % at $300, but since you put in $250 you won't see it.

That is KYC.

Absolute BS. Talk about Verification City... phone number needed before going to any screen.  Next, scan your Driver's License/Passport if over $1,500 (or whatever amount the operator chooses.) Some had palm vein scanners installed before people revolted...
you do realize that this thread is about purchasing BTC privately, right?

The Voice Of Reason.
In 10 years people will say
"...well, giving your address isn't KYC, but yeah, the iris-scan is."

best advice: skip ICOs

LOOOOOVEEEE this post.  
Your comment over there is in the negative, lol, but it is $1,000&amp; right, lol.
(Your original thread over there and this thread here should be screenshotted and memed.)
I love the internet.

Well shucks.  Thanks! 
"Only Vendors selling bitcoin for Gift Cards need to put up a Bond."
That's the reason I've been on the site for years and never heard of it.  I've never bought or accepted (and do not recommend anyone buying) Bitcoin through gift cards.  You lose 30-40-50&amp; of the value of the card right off the top.  Folks, just use the card and get your Bitcoin in cash.
"But I have this card and I'm never going to use it anyway blahblahblah..."
Take a $20 and rip it in half.  You wouldn't do that, right?  So don't throw money away because you don't value the form it came in.

I read below someone chiding you for not using an escrow site.  Localbitcoins IS an escrow site.  You just didn't use it properly.
OP, stop sending money around (crypto or fiat) until you learn more about what it is that you're doing.  I don't mean this in a mean way at all. 
You never give anyone your private keys.
You never send money straight to someone you do not know (without an escrow type service like WallOfCoins, Paxful or LocalBitcoins\*\*)
\*\*With LocalBitcoins people have gotten wise and now list their contact information in their ad, wanting you to get in touch with them directly, which then means you'll be sending them money directly.  Which is the dumbest thing that can be done in crypto
You've had this happen more than once.  This is not the scammers fault as he/she did not make you send your assets to them.
Also, it's time to start listening to your intuition more.  I'm sure during the process something sounded fishy or not right to you and you didn't key in on that feeling.  Rewind, remember and amplify those signals so that next time you stop and think and don't gloss over them.
As many others have said, chalk this up as a price paid for learning.  However if something happens again and you fall for another scam then you will not have learned anything from this one.

Cash. Quick moving cash.
Another person who's not read the whitepaper?
A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System
(Whatever we involve ourselves in, to do it justice we must understand it's origin and purpose, not what outside forces would like things to turn into.)

I logged in JUST to say this. Glad you did first. There are a lot of newcomers (finding out about crypto in the past 3 or 4 years) that don't know the basics.  And 
RULE # 1...
If your coins are sitting in an exchange
they are *not* your coins.
@_date: 2018-06-04 16:22:19
You've never read the white-paper.
And in no way understand the purpose of Bitcoin.
This is not my opinion, in light of what you've written? This is a fact.
..."peer-to-peer electronic cash system"
Advertising and propaganda have spread like wildfire so much so that up is down, wrong is right and "Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System" really means "gold."
It's only 9 pages.  Read it.

Bitcoin will be 1 million a coin, so no.
Yes means this: 21 coins = 21 million.
People chasing getting a millionth of the supply in order to "have a million dollars" have a picture,
they just don't have the big picture.

Please post info on a Paxful bond system. I've never heard of it and have sold on that site for years.

(EDIT: And here's why...
There are thousands of LBC users.  And it is easy to create a Reddit name that is the same of one of them.
Scam: create a Reddit name the same as someone on LBC.  Contact Reddit user and say hey! I'll help you!  I'm the same name over on \[Bitcoin site\].  Then, as always, the scam giveaway...
"just send me the money this way and we'll..." and then boom, you're done.
It always comes down to sending the money via some unverifiable manner.
So I tone down some of my vigor on posting the username and going on a witch hunt, because unless you messaged the guy **ON** LBC, LBCuser17 may not even know they were used in a scam.  )
Post the usernames.  Just like the Better Business Bureau, Consumer Reports, car crash safety tests etc, offenders are named.   If the community doesn't self\-police it invites outsiders to do it for them.
We don't need outsiders inside.  We need to know the guy's LBC/Reddit names.
