With more worldly experience, we can take them.

I think everyone requires some kind of compensation if trump wins.

Heh I sold at 9950 explaining there will be a mass sell at 10k, I'm still waiting for that dip to buy back in with interest.
Feeling a little cowardly now and might just accept the minimal loss.

I forgot all about dogecoin, I've just checked, I have $1.65.
Meh it can stay, just in case.

If he had a lump of coal up his ass it would be a diamond right now.

I um am weak and a coward. I just took the hit and bought back in. Because bitcoin just hit mainstream news here in the UK a lot of people are buying in. It will be a few days before it blows over, expect it to keep rising over the next two days

You make sense, I've set an alert for 11, if I do this I'm just going to have to accept that I was wrong and pretend it never happened. Then buy in drips throughout December to make up for my loss.

Curiosity got the better of me and I didn't want to watch it alone, so I didn't, me and my colleague were egging each other on to watch the whole thing and man, omg, that was horrific.
Just wow.
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:00:45
Yeah I only sold half... Just in case

That guy that said he would eat his own testicle must be sweating a bit right now.

I don't know!!!

The black Friday sale has extended to bitcoin!

Ok it took me two months to formulate a plan but I've got it, buy in now. Your patience will pay off.
