Not an answer to his rhetorical question. Fiat ATMs aren't magically free, they're funded by banks accounts. I pay my bank dozens of euros each year for the 'privilege 'of letting them hold my assets hostage and investing it for profits.

Chain fork yes. I think this is referring to source forks.

Transfer fees are a thing going outside SEPA. Monthly charges are common in the EU. AFAIK every bank account (physical banks) in NL have monthly fees of 2-4€.
If it's cheap in the UK you should be asking how you're paying. I'm guessing in risk: your funds are maybe exposed to investment and lack insurance?

How do you remember 58 names. And didn't some back out before, like shapeshifter?  And some exchanges are hard to avoid like coinbase, blockchain and ANX(temporary monopoly in Hong Kong). 
@_date: 2017-11-19 03:39:23


You mean "spoken as a mindless consumer". 
The world would be a better place if consumers cared about not just the product, but about the entire ecosystem surrounding it.

How could you not see it. Definitely artificial value spike during the last few weeks. Panic sellers gonna make us a black Friday.

It means techies think bitcoin is cool. Sweden has a lot of techies.

I'm not sure what you mean by inputting your private key. But you will transfer the coinbase coins to the trezor address using the coinbase transfer. So your trezor wallet will have its own set of addresses.

And glass bottles with notes inside.

But surely no-one is watching all the exchanges alll the time? I just need to find a few obscure ones in Mongolia or Vietnam or something.
@_date: 2017-09-25 01:14:29
Correct. The blockchain defines their existence. They can't exist outside it. 
@_date: 2017-09-25 05:42:53
But the nosedives are so short-lived. It rebounds so fast even after the China exchanges news. 
I don't have time to sit all day placing small sells during a dip. Placing a single large sell and buy order and forgetting about it is too risky, what if the collapse is fatal and you can't cancel the buy order in time. Or some bots on the exchange game you.
@_date: 2017-09-21 16:26:49
You can turn it into jewelry, computer parts or teeth. Can't do that with BTC, can ya? Sure you can't transport it at light speeds either, but at least it's shiny. 
@_date: 2017-09-21 16:03:03
I disagree. The fact that it is electronic is a minor novelty considering how much we already pay without cash. 
The real big idea is that it is a finite resource not controlled by governments (or anyone), being electronic just made it orders of magnitude more practical than precious metals. 
Another big idea is the blockchain because decentralization makes transactions anonymous and irreversible. This increases the safety and freedom of the good and bad. 
So by all means mention the electronic part, just don't leave out those two other parts. 
@_date: 2017-09-24 06:15:24
My wallet has an option to show me the unencrypted private keys. At the least yours should have an option to export it unencrypted. Otherwise you're locked-in by your choice of wallet. 
@_date: 2017-09-21 16:38:55
So who was the first to accept bitcoin for some product or service? Don't say Starbucks. 
@_date: 2017-09-29 15:37:06
If 90% of the hashing power goes on to play with fake bitcoin, does that mean I can mine real bitcoin  with my PC again? 
@_date: 2017-09-23 15:35:20
I was wondering how miner transaction fees are deducted. If I buy 100mBTC and the fee is 1mBTC, do I receive 99mBTC or is the fee deducted from the sender's 'change'. The latter would mean the input would need at least 101mBTC.
@_date: 2017-09-24 08:02:09
Miners won't stop when all coins are mined. 
@_date: 2017-09-23 15:09:48
Just get a pen and paper, write down the private key of the address you want to gift. Your friend can sweep or import the key with his or her wallet. 
If you want to make it fancy you can print a QR code version too. But this is mostly for smartphone users. 
@_date: 2017-10-01 10:15:42
10% discount, but at what exchange rate? Could be they use their own rates 20% higher than the local exchange average. 
@_date: 2017-09-23 16:25:33
So an investment that turns out profitable after 1 year. Compare with real estate where it takes 30 years to break even. 
@_date: 2017-09-23 15:01:41
It doesn't sound like you've done enough research to understand the risks. 
The coins are always in the public ledger called the blockchain. The private keys prove your claim on certain addresses, thus allowing you to 'spend'  them. All the keys managed by a wallet are stored in a single file (this file is often confusingly called a wallet too) . This could be a simple text file. In the case of coinbase it is probably an encrypted file on their server. 
@_date: 2017-09-21 16:33:54
You're implying that the word "ordinary"  has a condescending denotation. I can't help but think you need a dictionary. 
@_date: 2017-09-25 11:48:55
Actually if I start daytrading I'll begin with arbitraging. Just open 10 accounts at various exchanges and play them on a big monitor. 
@_date: 2017-09-21 16:11:22
And looking at China, real banks won't be offering BTC accounts anytime soon.

Isn't selling for free an oxymoron?
@_date: 2017-09-24 08:01:11
And you can't change their settings?! Sounds like they don't want you moving your BTC out of their wallet on a regular basis. 
@_date: 2017-09-21 16:56:20
North Korea? Or is that not the killer you're looking for :-) 
@_date: 2017-09-24 18:19:27
Correct. There are ways of importing without changing addresses, but I don't think that's applicable or desirable for your scenario. 
Note that coinbase uses a pretty high transaction fee, so the transfer won't be free. The upside is it will probably be fast. 
@_date: 2017-09-26 16:20:44
I'll one-up you: put it on a Samsung note 7.

I don't get it. By definition a CFD doesn't confer ownership of the underlying asset. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 16:45:28
But bitcoins don't have accounts? 
@_date: 2017-10-27 03:58:26
but snarky replies to corrections aren't.
@_date: 2017-10-26 13:32:26
Japan and Korea have some high volume exchanges too. 
@_date: 2017-09-21 17:06:09
I don't agree but in a pyramid the person promoting to other people gets richer as more people join. This is accurate. 
The problem with pyramids is that the bottom lowest layer are the big losers, whereas with bitcoin the latest adopters can choose how invested they get, potentially making bigger gains than the original promoter. 
So it's just the good half of a pyramid scheme.

unless they've been doing that in secret for the last 10 years.

Most places I've read define soft forks as having blocks where old blocks don't fit into new nodes, but new blocks can fit into old ones. AFAIK this Roger guy mined on the old network.

ANX 5 day verification takes 3 weeks. Then I got rejected via no-reply email because of a non-existant typo.  Am applying again. Taking weeks to register. Considering Japanese and Korean exchanges. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 16:23:26
They could replace the entire chain with a bogus one. No need to crack keys. The past never happened.
@_date: 2017-09-21 16:43:08
If you could prove they were finite, durable  and unforgeable, some hipster at that Starbucks will probably trade you his coffee for them.  
@_date: 2017-10-27 04:19:56
doesn't the network accept the valid longest chain? Are you saying the network would reject it, or that they can't create a valid longest chain.
@_date: 2017-10-26 13:30:06
For a larger buy try bittide. They have free cash deposits but a fixed 3mBTC withdrawal fee. Not worth it for buys less than 0.3BTC. Took 2 days to register compared to weeks with the other two exchanges. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 04:17:04
I'm not talking about a single block. I mean a new longest chain. If I understand correctly 51+% attacks have the power to rewrite the blockchain in its entirety (theoretically at least).
@_date: 2017-09-24 07:58:39
They also charge different depending on what currency you are sending. 
@_date: 2017-09-22 02:15:19
In that case the problem of how to implement electronic cash is a derivative of the core problems of how to stop governments controlling currency value or how to make transactions without banks. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 13:16:49
Useless. Not accepting new registrations. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 13:26:27
So if I transfer using the latest electrum wallet, which chain gets my transaction? If no protection then both chains should mine the same transaction right? Or is it first come first served? 
@_date: 2017-10-24 06:26:32
They weren't anti-segwit for ideological reasons lol. Unless profit somehow translates to a justifiable economic motive. As I understand it was mostly pushed by some chinese dude with a mining company.

"dictate consensus" is an oxymoron.

@_date: 2017-10-23 17:17:15
This sounds wrong? If coins don't exist, why everyone mention replay protection.

It doesn't matter much for gatecoin, a lot of their fiat is still frozen. Wish they'd hurry up and get HKD accounts again.

I think you mean democrat not liberal. Any EU reader reads liberal as 'economic liberal', i.e. right wing.
