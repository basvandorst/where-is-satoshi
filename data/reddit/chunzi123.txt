Well, pretty much all Australian crypto exchanges are crap. I previously  used Australian exchanges until I realized they don't care about the customers.

I mainly use LocalBitcoins but an Australia exchange that I have heard is good is btc-markets

Even though Bitcoin ATM's aren't necessarily the best deal when buying, it is still good that more options are coming to the market for people to get involved.

I don’t really fully get the Lightning network yet, so I can’t really notice that. I wasn’t planning on using it but thought it was good to have for the future. Should I stick to Bread wallet then?
I am confused about Lightning and how the channels are opened and such, so yea.
