would be the story so see me I'm not
interested in continuing this it's
Bitcoin cash get it straight and if you
do that again
I'm gonna end the interview because I'm
not interested in being insulted okay
I'm I'm promoting Bitcoin cash if I
didn't and so why do you have to take it
personally assist a name I actually like
it better often here I'm being insulted
I don't need to be insulted by you I
have enough money I was a self-made
multi-millionaire before I ever got
involved in Bitcoin I don't need to have
my buttons pushed by people like you on
the Internet it's Bitcoin gathering the
only reason you want to call it Bitcoin
cash is because you want to co-op the
brand I think Bitcoin cash has a more
legitimate claim to being the Bitcoin
that was outlined in the Bitcoin or
website is at this point so yes that's
my position
and why do you want people to think that
it's Bitcoin it's Bitcoin read my lips
you know it's Bitcoin cash Evan the
mother you may have found be cash you're
gonna have more I'm at this point it's
not be cash its Bitcoin cash look it's
it's what I call it I'm not doing it on
it's it's just so easy it's it's a nice
name it really is I don't need to be
insulted I was a self-made millionaire
before I even got involved in Bitcoin
now I have you do if you're a
millionaire it has nothing to do with
anything I don't need to be insulted by
some person on the internet what's your
gross annual revenue for exotica none of
your business
isn't it less than a million dollars huh
it has nothing to do with less than a
million dollars that of course
successful business of course we do more
than a million dollars and is not a
business we're not running a business
here Bitcoin is Bitcoin is changing
money is better not you know the same
comment I think that there are only
three people that want to call Bitcoin
cash Bitcoin cash you and Jahan and your
sock puppets okay because there's
there's nobody else ever hide a single
sock puppet I don't need to be insulted
but please post this the entire way how
incredibly rude you are to me hey I'm

TREZOR Delivery Update
Prague, Czech Republic, Oct. 28, 2013
Developing a first-of-its-kind hardware brought more challenges than expected and some of you might have already noticed that we have postponed our estimated TREZOR to January.
The fact that we are discussing most of our technical decisions with many bitcoin and hardware developers has brought valuable feedback but also caused some delays. Thanks to the community cooperation the scope of the project has enlarged significantly and our pace of work slowed down, but for a good purpose, we believe. 
Just to mention a few new developments that we have done on top of the basic hardware and software work on TREZOR: 
* improved and safer paper backup; 
* an entirely new way of secure PIN entering;
* deterministic signatures which add extra security to TREZOR transactions;
* compatibility with web wallets.

Digital Money : Bitcoin payments are tax-free - Money News - THE WORLD
The pendant of Bitcoins can look forward to another success . Anyone who uses the digital money as means of payment , it must pay no sales tax in Germany . This important legal clarification entails a current response of the Federal Ministry of Finance to a parliamentary question that has provided the FDP politician Frank Schaeffler .
So far, the VAT treatment of Bitcoins was controversial in Germany . The response of the Federal Ministry of Finance is the " world" exclusive. " The mere payment of compensation is not a supply of goods or services within the meaning of paragraph 1, paragraph 1 Sales Tax Act ," reads the letter from the Ministry of Finance.
" The Bitcoin can now easily be used for e -commerce. Turnover tax law barriers no longer exist ," Schaffler comments on the clarification of the facts. Bitcoins are the Euro and any other currency is now equivalent to sales tax . "This is really fantastic for all online retailers and Bitcoin friends . "
Already in August, the proponents of digital currency had made ​​a breakthrough . At that time the Federal Government had declared that it accepts Bitcoins as " private money " . Thus, the legal status is more stable than in other crops . Some analysts see in digital currencies " the next big thing " in the Internet business . The price of Bitcoins wavered for a time greatly , but has recently stabilized at slightly less than 100 euro .

Bitcoins are similar to gold
Introduced in 2009, the Bitcoin is the best known of a series of digital currencies. The currency with the symbol BTC has no central bank and no central administration. It is formed by computing processes on the Internet where it can be used like cash to pay for goods and services.
The amount of bitcoins increases with decreasing velocity and is limited to the top. In this respect, the digital money is similar to the real value of gold. An inflation as vermehrbarem unlimited paper money is impossible.
After digital currencies were mainly used as an object of speculation long , continuous takes its importance as an investment vehicle , and online payment. The Winklevoss brothers , who were involved in the emergence of Facebook , are currently engaged in a call Bitcoin index funds launched . Also Internet entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley and elsewhere have high hopes for digital cash .
What was needed now was legal certainty about the status of the monetary innovation. Here, Germany is now a pioneer , so you especially in the Bitcoin city of Berlin (there is a separate neighborhood , where shops selling the virtual money can be paid in "real" ) smells new entrepreneurial opportunities .
Frank Schaeffler has become known as a vehement critic of the " Euro - rescue policy" and is committed to currency competition in which citizens may use legal means of payment in addition to the other forms of money.
