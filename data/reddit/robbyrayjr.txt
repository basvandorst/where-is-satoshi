NO. It's not possible. I tried wiring funds but was rejected by 4 major banks of our country. They simply all stated that forex dealings in Bitcoin is not permitted/they won't allow because of the still legal grey area that bitcoin hangs in in our country. Don't waste your time. You may use the online international funds transfer facility but the online forms too ask your purpose for the transfer under fema act. Do keep in mind if you mis state the purpose you'll be intentionally breaking the law and fema penalties are no joke. Even if you escape somehow , eventually when you'll sell the btc and get INR you may be questioned on your source of funds for the initial purchase in which case you're screwed if you mis stated your purpose earlier (via online transfer). 
My advice - use coinome.com or some other exchange in India and bite the bullet. I know the difference of 8-10% seems too high when compared to international prices but trust me a 10% jump is nothing for btc. You'll recover that in just a few days.

Consider yourself extremely lucky that in a nation of 1.3 billion people you are knowledgeable enough to buy ₿ when the daily volume is 10-20 ₿. Because when we reach the level of global exchanges Bitcoin will be worth more than 10-100X from where it is now. Imagine a new wave that will hit ₿ from India!

Is it worth the hassle? You'd incur a significant amount  for just getting the documentation and transferring them to a European bank (if somehow they agree to agree to open an account remotely)
And even that would be futile though. You'd still be answerable to your bank why you need to remit funds which they can still deny!
Please understand India guards it's forex reserves like the fort Knox. It's not simply just converting inr to euro. Your actions would warrant sufficient justification for the govt to release the funds...

Guys is it a good time to go in or should I consider waiting for a dip? I'm sceptical a dip back to 5000 will ever happen. I'm waiting with a sizeable amount to put in..
Any thoughts/advice?
