I applied for an account the day after Coinbase launched Bcash. Took about 3-4 to weeks to process but I'm all set up now. Haven't made a purchase yet, but probably will soon once I see how bearish this current market wants to get.
That being said Gemini is not without their complaints as well, but I feel more comfortable with them now on principle, specifically on the segwit and Bcash issues.

Yeah but sideways after parabolic up can only last so long before bear market signals start occurring with greater frequency. Which is also natural, but really just starting look bad with this most recent drop. And before anyone starts the "technicals = voodoo" talk, remember most crypto trading is algorithmic and someone has to program the bots.
I'm still hodling, but I'm also expecting to be buying in the 10's or lower in the next few weeks.
@_date: 2018-01-14 16:27:20
My hodlings are in cold storage, and I already dumped my small trading budget at about 19k expecting the round-number rejection. And I only trade on high time frames so I'm not trying to time any of these bounces on the way down. I do expect to maybe see 15's or even 16's again before the real bottom, but I'll wait for long-term bull signals to reenter.

@_date: 2018-01-26 14:39:56
Or you know, it's a speculative asset going through the same kind of massive correction it's gone through several times already. Might not see 20k by year's end, it's a possibility (one I doubt, but possible), but the "outdated" meme is just wrong. It's still being actively developed ffs. A conservative approach to development is not the same as obsolescence. It's just not willing to make the compromises alts are willing to make in the name of expediency in the rush to gobble up market share. 
Despite the boom, no alt (well, besides Tether) has decoupled itself from bitcoin's price action. That is the best indicator of what "people realize." BTC market domination is a very short-term metric that can change on a dime in a real market crisis (not this very routine correction).

Without a doubt. I am bearish for maybe the quarter. Long term still big bull.
@_date: 2019-07-25 02:02:11
Dude do yourself a favor, build a proper diversified investment portfolio. Your hodl should never cause you to panic. You need to separate your long term belief in it from the price action which is basically Wall Street's plaything right now. Never seeing 3k again is perhaps more likely than not but far from off the table. 
Even if it continues to rise, upside potential decreases with every run, meaning where some early adopters may have easily 100x their position, buying today we'd be very lucky to 10x. So hodling today is more risk, less reward. There will most likely never be more bitcoin-made millionaires than there are now. Just something to consider.

Who knows. I am 100% anti-bcash and Roger but at this point anything could happen. I also sympathize with ancap ideals, but I don't subscribe to any ideology in a practical sense. If anything I am Machiavellian in my dealings. I think many ancaps are silly people, but the actual literature is strong.
I think crypto will probably bring us closer to it rather than further away, and I think that's a good thing. But I for one am not holding my breath for Libertopia and am paying the taxman. IMO you'd have to be a brazen idiot not to. Whether Roger is one is anyone's guess.

Please link where Ron Paul has ever used the phrase "trickle down economics."
Did you just get on board the hype train during his presidential runs, or did you actually read the literature that informs his positions to truly understand them? I can't imagine anyone who has read Mises, Rothbard, Hayek, Bastiat, etc. using "trickle down economics" as their primary point of contention.
Also market crashes don't naturally last a decade and a half. The New Deal caused the Great Depression to last as long as it did, and it would have lasted a lot longer if we didn't have a world war to fight.

Gold has remained stable for millenia. The real question is, is the value I have stored in it a missed opportunity to profit off a stock market bubble? Perhaps, and I do have some money in index funds too. But once the day of reckoning comes I believe the gold will win out, averaged over time.

Sitcoms have always appealed to the lowest-common denominator. Hollywood doesn't take chances like it used to so it's getting to about that point as well. 
As for standup, other than Bill Burr I think there has been a trend away from controversy and dancing on the edge like all the greats did in light of the current cultural/political climate (ironically set off in large part by the original squeaky clean comic). Also with Netflix there are more specials being put out than ever which comes with a certain dilution. I believe once the prevailing social justice hysteria jumps the shark and everyone forgets about Louie et al., there will be fertile ground for another Pryor/Kinison/Hicks/Carlin/O'Neal.
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:38:01
That would first require the existence of trustworthy people willing to leave the private sector to enter a cesspool of corruption, and invest their time and money trying to overcome the institutional money that has appealing to the least rational, most emotional voters down to a science.

That's a different discussion. Gold has a value, and the dollar has a value. Apples to apples, they have drifted apart, gold up, dollar down. That *is* inflation. Therefore controlling for inflation makes the comparison meaningless. Neither are an investment by itself. Gold is a store of value, and the dollar is a currency. In order to grow either you must take that value and put it in something else.
@_date: 2015-06-05 16:52:08
Adjusting for inflation defeats the purpose of the comparison.
@_date: 2015-06-05 19:43:28
Different time scales. The dollar is absolutely less volatile than BTC. A currency backed by the most powerful state in the world vs. an emerging technology a few years old -- of course this is true. What people mean when they say "fiat fluctuates" is over the course of decades. Take the dollar out of the equation and compare a traditional store of value, say, gold to oil -- the chart, while certainly exhibiting volatility, ultimately moves sideways. The dollar compared to anything historically has gone down.

There are no "stages" of capitalism. You can toss that theory in the garbage with Marx and Engels. Either you're free to do business or you're not. The aggregation by large entities happens through the structuring of corporate law, taxation, regulation, lobbying, etc. All things that are dictated by government and fundamentally anti-competitive and anti-capitalist. The inevitability you ascribe to a pure capitalist system is actually the result of the exact opposite, a creep further and further away from it.

Modern economies have not had a choice until the advent of cryptocurrency, which on the time frames involved was practically yesterday. There is nothing to compare against, meaning there is no way to tell if an economy grew due to its government's monopoly and central management of the money supply, or in spite of it. Nor can we tell if that is real permanent growth or a long multi-generational bubble that will eventually burst on an unlucky "hot potato" generation.

Yes I am aware of all that, that's why I changed the example from a fiat exchange to a crypto-only one. And yes, it's an unknown, but I look at it this way: if things do not continue to move in that direction, then crypto as a whole will have failed because the entire point of its creation was to eschew censorship. Without that there are no other use cases that can't be handled just fine by fiat and regular old databases. 
If crypto is ultimately to overtake fiat in economic terms, then the majority will have no reason to submit to any government demands because their assets will be unconfiscatable. And there will always be asylum for the physically persecuted somewhere. Only to those still dealing in fiat will regulations have any teeth at all, and at that point it might not be worth enough for anyone to even care anymore.

Trying to buy up your competition in a free market is like playing whack-a-mole. Sure they can do it once, twice, however many times. But if they're not managing that company as well as its founders otherwise would have as a nimble startup, you can be sure another entrepreneur will step in right where the other got bought out. And the larger they are the harder that is to do.
@_date: 2018-08-20 19:51:46
I am deadly serious. Your perception of how large businesses run betrays your ignorance. Yes, a large company can bully a smaller one through volume and margin -- this is true and that's part of the game in any market, small or large. 
But a large company also has less room for error *assuming* the only barrier for competition is the market itself. The penalty for not responding to market demand as competently as the smaller company is much steeper. They are slower to react and suffer the same bureaucratic inefficiency as government, except when the bottom line falls through, they are forced to take the loss and downsize or fail outright. 
This is the point at which most companies send their lawyers and lobbyists out to take out the competition because they are no longer able to in the market alone.

Sure it's suspicious, but that's not enough for me to state theory as fact. 
And my libertarian ideals have nothing to do with the reality of the situation. I could be a communist and what I said would still be true. If anything, my statement was an endorsement of government if you accept that insider trading should be illegal. 
Most people probably consider it less than ethical, but preventable it's not unless you have a central authority with the ability to take back unethically acquired profits, which is exactly what Bitcoin circumvents. The US government can hurt Coinbase on the fiat side because its business model is built around trying to walk the regulatory tightrope, but once that money is in the crypto economy, if an exchange like Binance tried something similar it could easily tell any and all regulators to pound sand.
@_date: 2018-05-03 14:40:09
I know the assumption is that the perpetrator of that is someone in the bcash camp, but is there any proof?

You're not doing ancaps any favors by trying to make this argument. Anarchism means "no hierarchy" which is a impossible, impractical ideal with dire consequences.

The anarcho part of ancap is just to suggest an absence of rulers, not the wholesale absence of hierarchy.

It's not the same as your example at all. Your example singles out one review out of many. Anything is possible with a sample size of n=1. This is the opposite. 
Yes, there is a non-zero possibility that any one of the recent hyped-up positive reviews are actually legitimate, but there is zero possibility that a large number of people suddenly dropped a bunch of them that just coincidentally check all the boxes for being fake. This is something many companies like Amazon and others have been trying to combat for years and has been well-studied, and the patterns are well-known -- not something people on this thread just came up with yesterday.

That's about as believable as someone claiming they didn't actually tell the hitman to kill anyone.

Nothing to stop it per se, but the economic incentive to do so is greatly decreased with the adoption of SegWit and Lightning on the horizon. 
Keep in mind that even without these disincentives, it still would have been economically unfeasible for the attacks to continue in perpetuity. Which is why it is assumed that Ver and associates were behind them-- no one would have reason continue to engage in such an expensive plot unless the temporary congestion and confusion financially benefited them in some way. 
Now that the crypto bubble has popped and BCH itself has forked and is slipping into irrelevancy, it is obvious to any potential copycats that despite temporary success the endgame is a losing proposition.

They're one and the same. Halvings are deflationary as a counter to the inflationary financial system, which has brought down every historical financial system to date. 
But non-bitcoin crypto is inherently inflationary on bitcoin's deflation which is why bitcoiners an altcoiners will forever be at odds until either bitcoin wins or they both lose. If repeatedly cutting the supply in half does not continually increase demand thereby driving up price then the experiment fails for everyone.

@_date: 2019-12-10 17:36:02
Well, most cryptos are self-aware enough now to know they are inherently inflationary so they don't include things like halvings in the code. 
Digital cash is a fuzzy term. It's either what already exists and is used by everyone or an oxymoron. Cash is fiat. Online banking is digital cash. If it weren't for inflationary monetary systems the concept of cash wouldn't exist.
The argument that bitcoin is too slow to be used in the same manner as people currently use cash is a valid argument, but competing standards are not the solution in the same way that a silver standard is not a solution to the impracticality of dividing physical gold for every transaction. The solution is to build on top of the sound money standard, otherwise you end up with the same problem you were trying to escape in the first place.
@_date: 2019-12-10 17:13:42
Litecoin itself is inflationary on bitcoin. Its value proposition of silver to bitcoin's gold doesn't make any sense. In the early days it served as a kind of testnet for bitcoin which has grown less and less necessary over the years. A deflationary mechanism in an inherently inflationary asset is a death sentence. Litecoin will eventually be forced to get rid of halvings or go to zero.

Right, I thought I wound up in that sub which shall not be mentioned for a second. There was a time when it was a novel idea to be entertained, but it should be clear to all now after all that has transpired that there was really only ever one problem, hard money, and bitcoin is the solution.
Everything else is dependent on charismatic leaders pitching solutions to problems that don't exist. But people won't believe this until the big ones bite the dust under economic and scaling pressure.

People with margin accounts make money by shorting it. That's part of what's driving the price down in the first place.

You can't escape the fact the Ethereum would have never been conceived of without Bitcoin, though. It can never truly be its own thing. Ultimately by creating a token as a tradeable asset with a market value, you are by default in direct competition with Bitcoin and therefore should expect to be compared to it as money. If the intention behind its creation was truly something other than being money then there is no need to issue a token; it should just issue shares of stock like any other company.

Don't take responsibility off the shoulders people who bought into something they knew nothing about. Yes a small number of people manipulate the price, but the magnitude to which they can do it is 100% based on human greed. Pigs get slaughtered, and every single one of us has the capacity to be a pig. And in an extremely regulated political climate where protecting people from themselves is supposedly a virtue, this is a much needed reminder.

Right, all those many deflationary systems. Like bitcoin, gold, and uh...
Strange how banks still hold onto that old outdated deflationary metal that doesn't work.
It's certainly a market. Don't know how free it is when it's not even allowed to discover its own interest rates.
@_date: 2019-09-23 17:17:17
Still using that word "free," I see. Maybe you will learn as well. Hard money rewards responsible savers. Centrally controlled inflation penalizes them and encourages investment regardless of how sound those investments are. Oversight = not allowing liquidation of malinvestment and doubling down on it instead. 
It works until it doesn't.

I avoided the question because like your previous one the answer is more nuanced than you imply, and I've been around long enough to not get baited into long tit-for-tat multi-quote wanderings into tangential subjects.
But the short answer is no, but not for the reason you would think. Yes, maintaining a multi-generational stalemate is an economic waste. But again, the US was instrumental in exacerbating the conflict into something that the military-industrial complex could profit from -- more broken windows. US imperialist blundering helped radicalize the KPR just like it did the Taliban 40 years later. And again, [historical fact indicates as much]( though this nuance is often lost to the more simplistic nationalist propaganda of the Red Scare and containment. The fact that it did not end as badly as Vietnam makes it easier to overlook the fact that it was waged on the same principles.
@_date: 2015-09-28 22:01:04
Money can certainly buy power, but real power is the ability to control the money. That's what virtual currency subverts. It doesn't stop manipulation, which is an unavoidable reality of all markets, or even collusion, but it does stop corruption, as there is no central controller whose favor can be bought. No one's getting a bitcoin bailout.
@_date: 2015-03-29 22:54:47
While what you say is correct, those are some big "ifs."
Credit economies work great for private entities because self-preservation in a competitive environment is quite a strong incentive to be responsible with it, and continue to grow it.
BUT if the credit is being used to start wars with extended occupations, line the pockets of corporations that as a result become "too big to fail" (including passing anti-competitive regulation written by lobbyists of those corporations to ensure they stay that way), fund social programs with absurd overhead costs that only marginally help the people they purport to but fill a lot of pockets along the way, and generally engage in broken window type spending without fear of immediate repercussion due to the strength of the dollar... then future generations are slowly going to find it more and more difficult and eventually impossible to grow.

And at the end of the day, I assert that people in positions of power to influence public opinion and profit from war did not get there by being altruistic. Motivation is of primary importance for every purposeful action taken by every individual from the least to the most significant, so much so that there is an entire field dedicated to examining it, praxeology. If the question is "*could* this have been done from a good place," the answer will always be yes. But as the saying goes, the road to Hell is paved with good intentions.

Hitler was doomed the moment he set foot in Russia. In the interest of not getting into an extended tit-for-tat debate, [here is your counterargument]( for how and why the US really got involved in WWII. I expect you will balk at the source, but all the evidence for the argument is well agreed upon historical fact. This is not to justify Nazi aggression against its neighbors or the Holocaust, but rather to demonstrate how diplomacy was intentionally avoided to profit off the destruction of German and Japanese economies, which may have been a net economic boon for the US (especially with the extreme belt-tightening with rations by fooling the American people into believing they were victims), but overall was a great net economic loss for the world.

@_date: 2015-03-30 17:20:46
To be perfectly blunt, I have little interest in doing work to appease someone who won't invest time himself.
I am saying FDR and his cronies saw a profit opportunity and turned a European war into a world war.
I am saying although there are always profiteers, and winners and losers, destruction is always a net loss overall. How can it possibly be anything else? Self-defense is one thing, but barring that, how can one create wealth by destroying something?
@_date: 2015-03-31 15:44:48
In very general terms, yes, although there is a lot of specific anarchist theory I don't agree with as well. Usually that term is used derisively by those who aren't familiar with or don't fully understand the implications of it.
And of course genocide is bad. But genocide + war profiteering is worse. If you get caught up in the propaganda of righteous indignation, it's easy to say your opponents have no empathy. But if you consider the power dynamics in play in any given situation you will see that war is never altruistic. There is plenty of slavery and genocide ongoing in the world, but no intervention because there is little upside and huge downside potential to the profiteers. But as soon as there is political capital at stake, you can be sure hearts will begin bleeding and the drums will start thumping.
@_date: 2015-03-30 04:30:47
You're technically correct again. Credit is credit, there's no difference between how a government and a business use it. But businesses open and fail every day, and it's no big deal, because competition makes them redundant. Government is essentially the mother business that can order around all the other businesses, no one can compete with it, and as such can be far more irresponsible for far longer while mitigating the effects. But when they fail it is spectacular and affects every facet of society.
War is the ultimate broken window. Lots of people get rich off it, but overall destruction can never be a net economically positive act overall on society. The idea that any given example of science or progress would not have happened without it is frankly ridiculous, and as a human I just can't imagine how one can so casually state that humanity benefits from mass killing, even there were some economic upside to it.
@_date: 2017-07-25 03:18:19

@_date: 2015-03-30 22:23:22
Everyone has an agenda. Part of mine is simply remaining concise.
All governments violate human rights. That is merely how it is sold by the people who intend to profit off it. It always comes down to that bottom line. If there is no potential there, there is never intervention.
It is each individual's responsibility to stand up to the tyranny of their own homeland, whether that be an invader or their own government. I do support any effort by a people to free themselves of that tyranny. But war itself is inhumane, attempting to use it to solve human rights abuses around the world makes zero sense.

Would only work if everything is denominated in bitcoin, or crypto in general. As soon as USD or other global fiat is involved regulation puts you right back where you started. That's where Coinbase essentially is already. But then you have another trust problem because even a bitcoin-only entity like Bitmex can be attacked even though their opsec is excellent. 
Being your own custodian is the primary solution to trust that bitcoin was created for so sidestepping that for convenience is necessarily exposing yourself to some of the very risks it was designed to avoid.
@_date: 2019-05-07 12:11:07
This isn't about the user, it's about the business model. If you touch USD or other fiat at all, the US government can just say the word and confiscate it. Just watch as the whole Bitfinex/Tether fiasco unfolds, we're about to see it in real time. And even bitcoin-only businesses are only as safe as the jurisdiction they're in. You might be able to secure your bitcoin, but good luck securing yourself. Your private keys won't keep you from being imprisoned. 
But then again anyone willing to give away custodianship to a 3rd party probably for convenience doesn't even understand what that means, and probably deserves what's coming to them.
@_date: 2019-05-09 15:08:34
I do disagree with that. Clearly plenty of non-coding human beings still day trade and make a living off it. I've done it and been profitable, it's just not my style. 
Plus in order to code a bot, first you need to be competent in programming principles, then you need to figure out how to translate your human decision-making process into code, including all the edge cases that might keep you out of a trade. That's an exponentially steeper learning curve if starting from scratch. 
I really think the whole AI thing is just an excuse people use to explain their failure. All markets are traded by both humans and algorithms, and they're all looking for the same things. Chess is a complex yet ultimately closed, finite system of possibilities, so the limitation is just the inability of a human to memorize every possible scenario. In trading possibilities are infinite so no such limitation exists.

Not just any shitcoins, that's why I specified big blocks. That was the central argument for the bcash hard fork-- that the competitive nature of the fee structure prices out the unbanked poor and becomes useless for microtransactions during times of congestion, and Bitcoin should prioritize that use case over everything else.
Obviously the network rejected that argument for a few reasons, not the least of which was for fear of weakening its case as a store of value that creates that sense of trust. 
ETH doesn't have that trust because as everyone saw it can be forked by fiat in a top-down manner. But it's currently more useful to unbanked Venezuelans on the street right now, and that's okay because Bitcoin is in a better position long term.
@_date: 2019-05-03 12:51:20

I wouldn't call it abuse. All markets are fractal down to the tick, and different trading styles are for different time frames. And there are plenty of scalpers that don't code bots. If there weren't scalpers then there would be no volatility and thus a dead market. And since everything is fractal, they can get fucked just as easily as swing traders because they're highly leveraged so smaller movements are more significant.
@_date: 2018-12-29 15:05:21
Aha, now I see why you are making this argument. This is just unnecessary complication of a problem that has an infinitely low probability of happening in the first place, that leads to untenable economic outcomes just like ETH itself and all other smart contract platforms. But I suppose nothing will convince people making this argument other than the demise of such platforms as they inflate themselves to death, and survival of bitcoin. All the more reason an overall market capitulation is necessary. We shall see.

By your definition I can own two computers, create a fork of a cryptocurrency, and run it, and claim I am now semidecentralized and thus free of state currencies. In practical application though, economics is going to have something to say about that.
Also a big drop in the bitcoin price will not destroy bitcoin. In fact it will probably happen in the next year or two and shake out a lot of those big players that are essentially over-leveraged in their investments in equipment. Free markets have a way of doing that. But then there will be new players that if you add them together will be more than 51%. Still meaningless.
@_date: 2019-05-09 14:24:44
Oh absolutely. I think almost everyone that figures it out learns that the hard way. That's why I don't like to day trade. I don't want to be constantly wrestling with my emotions every day and giving myself lots of opportunities to wreck myself. I'm happy to wait for the rare big high-probability setups.
I just think if everyone who makes dogmatic statements about trading spent a week learning a bit of technical analysis, they'd realize the logical part is not that difficult and it's not voodoo.
@_date: 2019-05-12 14:27:37
Both are use cases, but economically this is backwards. If this were true then the big-block shitcoiners would have a point.
@_date: 2018-12-29 14:02:22
It's meaningless to say "if you group three organizations together they could 51% attack bitcoin." First, bitcoin will be just fine even if they all went down. Second, they're competing in a free market just like everyone else. Third, the amount of capital and resources it would take to actually do that would be astronomical, and all wasted even if these hypothetically colluding parties were hypothetically successful. So yeah, the decentralization of Bitcoin is about as absolute as you can get, and the decentralization of any state-run crypto is zero.
@_date: 2017-07-25 02:39:55

Funny, but the strongest resistance is the current top - 6090 or so. That was the support that broke down. So we really need one more leg up and for it to close the week there to say we're through it.

Day trading isn't about calling tops and bottoms, it's about getting in and out quickly. Hence "the trend is your friend till the end." Swing trading can be about that, but even if you're wrong, as long as you short when it's overextended to the upside and at resistance you can set a stop loss at break-even for a no-risk trade.
It's actually quite simple to figure out. The hard part is the mental discipline, sitting on your hands and sticking to the plan. Most people don't have that kind of patience.
It might not "crash," but it absolutely will pull back eventually, the question is just how much. So even if someone screwed up and shorted 5750 or whatever and let it run, as long as they're not over-leveraged probabilities are still decent it will be profitable eventually.
