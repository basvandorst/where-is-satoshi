Oh for fucks sake, do some bloody research about what you bought before you go bitching and moaning about fees.    
Yes, the fees are high, Bitcoin has grown incredibly fast, it's not ready to be used as currency yet. It's still in development.   You bought the beta version and you're complaining that all the features aren't implemented yet.

The extremely wealthy don't invest their money like regular folk and take a 5-10% return. They're used to getting 10x plus returns on business ventures

And 5 years ago you were probably telling people to cut their losses too. Hopefully they didn't listen to you because you have no idea what you're talking about and would have cost them a fortune. If you have no interest in Bitcoin stay the fuck out of it.

You're implying that their wealth will be impacted by the depreciating of fiat currency if crypto was to take the lead.   
But what I'm saying is that the ultra wealthy have their funds tied up in business ventures and assets with intrinsic value. Whatever the dominant currency doesn't matter because their assets can be valued and/or realised in either.

This has happened to pretty much everyone I know. As soon as the other half finds out how much its worth they start planning how they're going to spend it. Vacation is always high on the list.   
This is why people are poor, they've been programmed that every dollar they have must be spent on some bullshit.   By all means, scrape the foam off the top of this latte and enjoy life, but compounding returns means the harder your money works the less you have to. HODL strong!

That's not arrogance, that's insecurity.   He thinks people are defined by their wealth because he brings nothing to the table but greed.

@_date: 2017-11-05 10:01:51
Whenever I talk to anyone who is a bit sceptical of crypto its always, "I'll never invest in something that had no asset behind it, where does it get it's value from?".  
Look at the size of the fucking derivatives market! Look at the physical money split, and the amount of debt to GDP. Seriously, our financial system had been creating money out of thin air for decades, and it's the hard working and middle classes that get fucked by it.
@_date: 2017-11-02 05:32:29
You don't think Jamie got way too much credit for that dip?  
Sure the timing was right, but his reaction was pretty much in line with expectations of most BTC holders.

My guess is that they're going to try and suppress the price during the next halving. Hurt the miners when the reward drops, spook the market into thinking history isn't going to repeat. Pile on a bunch of bad news stories and buy up coins at a discount

Not saying that valuation is plausible, but even though few (literally) could afford a Bitcoin at that price, they could still buy a Satoshi at $10.
   
Unless the Fed and banks stop creating money out of thin air (unlikely), Bitcoin value should always increase relatively

Your 'finisher' makes no sense. At the time of purchase the cost to the buyer is technically the same whether he/she uses fiat or Bitcoin. The impact of the appreciation in Bitcoin vs fiat is the same no matter what currency they use. That is the opportunity cost of holding vs selling and appreciating asset
@_date: 2017-09-19 00:25:10
What if JPM buy all the Bitcoin though, while it's cheap?. Obviously they can't buy all of it, but if they hold enough of it they could control the market to a point and we're right back where we started

@_date: 2017-10-17 09:03:41
They're invested in the funds they're pushing, of course they want others to follow and push the price up.
People fear what they don't understand. Bitcoin goes against everything we've ever been taught about money and regulation. There's still people out there that think the government's of the world have their best interests in mind.
@_date: 2017-09-17 05:43:13
Yep, they just brokered the transactions for clients. Massive transactions that were perfectly timed to purchase currency at a discount based on the very public actions of the CEO. decentralised currency and these pricks are already manipulating it.

It's probably not worth it to begin with. I started with a desktop wallet, but we my holdings increased I bought a nano s with some of the profits. It's worth it not just for the security, but for the ease of use - no more long complicated passwords to enter

I've thought about this too. How good life would be with no debts. But then, if your crypto portfolio is doubling every year, how could you kill that cash cow.  Withdrawing something with 100% returns to pay off debt at eg. 5%.   
You would be financially better off just posting your mortgage repayments with Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 01:50:36
I feel your pain, but you need to look on the bright side. As long as the majority hold these views, we can continue to accumulate at a decent rate.
