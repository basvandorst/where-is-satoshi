I've personally had several problems with them.  
Their general attitude towards user funds is disgusting.  
They place holds on funds too casually and they'll happy allow you to deposit any funds without warning you about the limitations/road blocks involved in withdrawing those same funds.  
They're also increasingly pushing users to provide personal information (ID + photo even) for cryptocurrency withdraws that don't involve fiat, claiming U.S. regulation compliance as the reason, but there are no regulations for cryptocurrency withdraws that don't involve fiat.

In the past, the fees were never this high though.  
A key part of Bitcoin's value is merchant acceptance and consumer use. With the current fees, it's losing that key part.

I'm confused again. I thought this sub was the one that wanted 2x so that the lighting network could be added.

The vast majority of politicians aren't our government; they're just various criminals &amp; blackmailed child molesters. The real government is composed mostly of people you've never heard of, and they don't fear us so much as they fear having to delay, or scrap, their global domination agenda.  
They could kill all of us at any time if they wanted to.  
That's not what they want though. They want to rule over a slave class that has been conditioned to believe they're not slaves.

Appealing concept that I hadn't thought if. Good one man.

To clear up confusion, could you state very plainly what was wrong with bitcoin? Why did it need to have something done to it?  
Was it that transaction times were getting longer and fees were getting larger?

I thought they needed 2x as well.  
What exactly is 2x for then?

There are people who made millions who are cashing out on LBC as we speak. Just takes some time.

To cash out on Gemini, they demand just about everything but your DNA. I'd rather spend a year cashing out on localbitcoins than use Gemini.

Everything they're accusing Alex of, U.S. bankers, CEO's, politicians and other members of their ilk are given a pass on all the time.  
This has nothing to do with morality/criminality/law enforcement. It's all about control; taking down competition and threats to their power structure, and confiscating their wealth/assets.
