"This survey was conducted online within the United States by Harris Poll on behalf of Blockchain Capital from October 18-20, 2017 among 2,112 U.S. adults ages 18 and older, among whom 387 are millennials (ages 18-34).  This online survey is not based on a probability sample and therefore no estimate of theoretical sampling error can be calculated. "
So.. sample size of 387, from a self directed online poll, with no sampling error calculation possible.  Seems legit.

that's... not correct. buying something with bitcoin is selling for fiat and subsequently buying something for fiat, for tax purposes. you garner the capital gains at time of sale.

@_date: 2017-08-16 00:29:41
Your fundamental premise is wrong. 


You don't. You generate entropy, and then add a checksum and chunk it up into the mnemonic word list. 
The mnemonic words are strictly to encode the entropy into an easily transcribable format  that has some error checking encoded into it. 
You can't just pick words, because of the checksum, so your math is doomed from the start.
The processes that generate the wallet do not use the words, they use the entropy. If you're restoring from the mnemonic, it first changes that back into the entropy, verifies the checksum, and works off the entropy.
Furthermore the key derivation uses 2048 rounds of hashing of the entropy along with the salt to arrive at the master key. If you change one bit of the entropy, you have 2048 rounds of hashing to do before having another key to check, so it isn't one-hash-one-guess.
See

@_date: 2017-08-12 03:59:49
If you have the bip39 mnemonic (and optional passphrase), you have the private key. Unless you're very interested in cryptography, you don't need to put any more thought into it. The only thing you should think about is adding a passphrase, if you don't have one.
@_date: 2017-08-17 00:40:21


Unless you are 100% convinced the physical security of your recovery mnemonic, you should absolutely have the passphrase enabled, and either memorized, or written down and stored somewhere other than with the recovery mnemonic. 
This is similar to why 2 factor authentication is effective. It is something you have (the mnemonic) and something you know (the passphrase).
@_date: 2017-08-16 15:27:14
It does, but there is no way to generate or verify the checksum without converting the words back to entropy, so it doesn't make sense to even talk about word combinations with respect to the security of bip39.
@_date: 2017-08-31 23:46:45
@_date: 2017-08-16 03:02:07


That is correct, however not all sets of words are valid seeds, because of the checksum. If you pick 12 random words and try to restore into a bip39 compliant wallet, there is only a 1/16 chance you'll have a valid seed.  For 24 words, it is a 1/256 chance.


We have every piece of the key derivation function. The calculation, while not simple, is perfectly deterministic. How many operations does it take to guess a number of 2^128 bits, hash it 2048 times (ignoring the salt) and check the balance?

There's a few reasons that low difficulty is bad for the health of the coin
* Inflation, lots of coins generated relative to the transaction volume. 
* The history is easier to rewrite, so the security is lower
* The network will split more often as blocks are found concurrently by different nodes, leading to waste of mining power building on chains that will end up orphaned 
* Decentralization suffers from short block time. Those miners that are physically close to one another see every block sooner than miners on the edge of the network. A 3 second difference in a system with one block per 10 minutes means burning 3 seconds worth of useless hashes once per 10 minutes, or .5% disadvantage. A 1 minute block time means you're at a 5% disadvantage, and so on.
Nothing magical about 10 minute avg block time, a lot of other coins go for lower difficulty for faster transactions, but it is a major trade off.

You need to keep reading beyond what you quoted. The optimization can be accomplished by ordering and substituting the transactions on the right side of the merkle tree, and extra-nonce grinding the left side.  
Empty blocks are one way, but not the only way.

They are a representation of the key+checksum 
The process is:
1) generate a random number (entropy)
2) hash it and append the checksum
3) break the result up the result into 11-bit groups
4) for each group, find the corresponding word from the word list

the checksum is  32 bits.  So 1/2^32 chance.


so you'd need to fuck up around 3 billion times in a row before you reach a 50% chance of a match occurring.

It does more than that. The signaling period is drastically reduced (to coincide with bip148 activation), and also enforces signaling bip8 style after the signaling period.
