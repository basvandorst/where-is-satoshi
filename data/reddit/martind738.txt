Yep. He says he tries not to think about it lol. Bought them in 2014 I believe.

Very easy to forget your portfolio is probably still triple what it was in early December. The January bull-run spoilt everyone.
@_date: 2018-01-07 15:25:37
This is spot on. The first thing I say is: if you can’t be bothered to learn about it, don’t bother investing in it.
@_date: 2018-01-13 22:26:28
I think that if we see a lot of money come in between now and February, you could hedge your bets that big finance recognises the potential of blockchain and cryptos. That’s what the deal with Wall Street bonuses is.

Bitcoin is yahoo/AOL
Find the google bro, find the google.

I know someone that formatted a hard drive with 40BTC on. Never backed up.
@_date: 2019-07-26 16:06:20
I wish there was a fuck off easy way of claiming and selling these forks.
@_date: 2019-07-31 21:26:09
It won’t be able to sustain itself. Which is why newer cryptocurrencies offer better solutions.
@_date: 2019-07-24 12:03:24
In 2011 I was discussing bitcoin with fellow apprentices saying how we should have bought some in 2009 and cursing our luck. None of us bought any!
@_date: 2018-09-16 16:54:44
Why don’t we ask Colin what his motivation really was?
@_date: 2018-09-19 07:16:59
Looks like he sodl.
@_date: 2018-08-04 14:39:59
I’d still argue it’s not good enough. It needs to be a lot cheaper and faster. 
@_date: 2018-08-04 14:48:34
LN needs to work first 
@_date: 2018-08-04 09:49:39
Yea it concerns me that if it’s tried to be used as it is it now, it won’t work.
@_date: 2018-05-21 15:49:36
It’s a... +4% day
@_date: 2018-08-04 08:33:56
Bitcoin cannot function as a global currency in its current form. 
@_date: 2018-08-03 06:36:11
We are entering denial.
@_date: 2018-05-03 14:43:58
Nope! 
@_date: 2018-05-03 14:27:12
Amen 
@_date: 2018-05-03 13:03:41
Is nobody going to talk about the glaring typo? ��
@_date: 2018-05-03 13:21:35
“*What* is bitcoin cash?”
@_date: 2018-05-20 19:14:08
Choosers can be beggars
@_date: 2018-05-28 17:02:40
You are the *one* the crypto gods prophesied. 
@_date: 2018-05-16 20:28:18
I don’t think it will be Bitcoin. I’m bullish, but I think there will be a huge push from governments and already established giants to get mainstream first.
@_date: 2018-05-16 21:11:35
You can’t just say ‘uh no’ because you will it. The global power resides in governments and economic power is in Amazon, google, etc. If they want to use a centralised Cryptocurrency, you can bet they will.
@_date: 2018-05-07 07:55:45
‘Store of value’ is nonsense. It has to be a functioning currency or its over.
@_date: 2018-05-13 19:23:23
Why on earth would a bank use bitcoin for international transfers? It’s too expensive and too slow surely?
@_date: 2018-05-14 18:36:48
@_date: 2018-05-03 14:43:51
I haven’t watched it. I just didn’t think it made sense. 
@_date: 2018-05-03 14:17:31
But the sentence doesn’t answer the question in the first part...
It should say: was it bitcoin cash?
Or have I missed something?
@_date: 2019-11-24 07:29:09
Because everything is traceable...?
@_date: 2018-06-02 15:57:47
Too many holders tribalising their coins too afraid to admit they may be holding duds, and need to see what else is out there.
@_date: 2018-06-20 21:07:56
Using Tether is dumb. You short the market during bear, and miss the run during bull. 
@_date: 2018-06-09 10:25:44
This is accurate for crypto, but not for bitcoin compared to other cryptos.
@_date: 2018-06-25 17:08:13
This has not been good for the market the previous few times. Tether is literally killing the market. Fiat backed by fake fiat. Put your money into bitcoin or bitcoin cash or whatever your favourite crypto is and hold.

Can we community fund a spotlight to shine on the building over night for a week?

Still waiting for capitulation...
@_date: 2018-06-13 13:03:29
Agree. I think we’re still in anxiety. About to enter denial. Expect more ‘institutional investors coming’ posts. 
@_date: 2019-06-11 06:58:02
I think you could still make a counter argument just as strong saying Bitcoin is AOL and we haven’t seen Google yet.
@_date: 2019-02-03 21:34:45
It really irks me seeing someone repost a graphic they didn’t make from this sub within the last year.
@_date: 2019-06-11 07:02:02
People like this make me wonder where they do their research, if any.
@_date: 2019-12-01 23:52:01
No wonder they won’t list other crypto currencies... heavy bitcoin bags.
@_date: 2019-12-30 22:48:40
When people expect the price to do something, it never does.
@_date: 2019-06-04 10:21:14
If you think the bear market is finished I’ve got news for you son xoxo

If this goes to $15 I’m fucking all in my broski

Invested $6000, rode to $12000. Took out my original $6000. Rode to $40,000. Watched market dump.
Still up $15000.

Clever guy. Goes to show this current crash is a ripple in the ocean...
@_date: 2018-03-08 09:39:31
If you’re amazon/google you wait. You watch blockchain and cryptocurrencies for 10 years. You watch to see what fails, what works, what you like and what you don’t like.
Then you announce your own coin. You take no.1 spot in a matter of weeks.
@_date: 2018-02-12 06:55:46
Poor argument. Some horse breeds are far more expensive than cars.
@_date: 2018-02-25 15:45:25
Time to adopt new technology.
@_date: 2018-03-08 11:13:45
That is not a cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2018-03-01 13:33:32
I think if you are really this concerned about privacy, you should be using Monero.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:33:30
Possibly, but the technology is still here to stay. There are plenty of alternatives that have a future.
@_date: 2018-07-17 19:06:36
Please drop your fucking Tether and buy bitcoin again.
@_date: 2019-09-09 21:57:58
I saw a Bitcoin on Noggenfogger EU... he said he didn’t even own any crypto. Either he knows the first rule about bitcoin or he’s a fraud!
@_date: 2018-07-03 21:13:40
India is a country of 1.1 billion people of which the vast majority are living in poverty. If crypto is to be adopted it will be in these countries first. Don’t for a second think it doesn’t matter.
@_date: 2018-04-15 20:41:56
@_date: 2018-04-25 15:10:54
This isn’t necessarily fraud. It’s a very distinctive split in the community where one believes a, and one believes b. Time will tell where the better choice lies.
@_date: 2018-04-15 20:41:50
Thanks for this
@_date: 2018-04-23 14:01:27
Oh shit.

The integrity you’re questioning is the medium we use to access blockchain technology; not the blockchain technology itself. 
Auditing is difficult in its current format but every transaction is recorded; it’s immutable and absolutely traceable. It is far more audit-friendly than the cash in your pocket, because once you’ve identified one person’s purchase on the blockchain, you can trace everything they have done on it, and know that it is unquestionably accurate.
Regarding your afghan villager analogy; you’re again questioning the medium people use to access blockchain technology. The interface people use is (as you rightly suggest), one of the biggest challenges cryptocurrencies are facing for adoption. Similarly to your example, did you know that 80% of Kenya’s GDP is made of a digitalised currency? [see here]( 
People are literally trading mobile data and call minutes for food and water. Now, imagine the potential in western countries where technology is so widespread.
The weaknesses of blockchain technology are not weaknesses of blockchain technology at all, but are borne from how young the technology is. I think your arguments are almost certainly applicable to cryptocurrencies, and it’s interfaces. Look at the internet; still marred by problems today. Decades since its inception most would argue it contains the cesspit of humanity, and yet still the greatest invention of the last century.
@_date: 2018-04-15 20:27:51
I didn’t, but now I do! But is it a fallacy to presume he chose the best option?
@_date: 2018-04-15 20:10:33
Genuine question; what about radically different approach to the technology? Specifically, block lattice.
@_date: 2018-04-16 19:48:22
Throughout history any civilisation that has introduced fiat currency has faced economic ruin and collapse soon after. Time is ticking.

Firstly, nice copy paste from Medium.
Secondly, all you need to say is that blockchain is a ledger. Decentralisation builds trust because it removes manipulation from the ledger.
Here’s a scenario for you: 
Government spends *$1bn* on Overseas Aid. 
Overseas Aid reaches *10%* of its intended target.
*Where did that money go?*
*Who of the intended target actually received the money?*
*How and Why did unintended party receive funds?*
Blockchain ledger technology has the potential to remove this lack of trust, and ensure the funds are only accessible by the intended party.
The real question is: do governments have the appetite to adopt this change or would they rather the lack of trust was still in place? I suspect we all know the answer to this. 
It will take time. That’s why it hasn’t been adopted yet.
