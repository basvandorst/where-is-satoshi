I just woke up from a coma and I see bitcoin is 10k ... this is my first thread I read on reddit and you're talking about bitcoin's death. Am I still in a coma, am I halucinating ?

I like all the ETH groupies bashing on ol` bitcoiny but they seem to ignore that techwise they're in the same boat. Not too long ago the whole eth chain was rekt by one of their precious dapps which is essentially the only plus eth has on btc but not because btc didn't adopt the tech but because btc did it in 2013-2014 and people realize the chain will get incredibly bloated if extra data starts going into transactions and until a fesible scaling method appears gloating about dapps is just a gimmick. 
Also let's not mention the doing the one thing blockchains are meant to prevent (tampering with transactions history).
Also the pow to pos switch oh what a shitshow that will be.

Yeah I'm gonna second that on no more than a gut feeling. There's still a buttload of new money coming into bitcoin 15k is a very good psych buy price preparing for the 20-40k jump (which I'm not saying will come, others are saying)
LE: Because of the new money incoming we might stop at 17k

I have a 12k$ withdrawal pending for what is now more than 1 week with no answeres at all ... so I feel you but from what I got asking around is that they're slow (especially now when business is booming) but they will EVENTUALLY come through.

The uk trademark law is all kinds of f*ed up. Some nut job trademarked the name of a saint in Romania in the UK and is running around from church to church with cease and desist orders. You can't make this shit up.

in two years the number of bitcoins rewarded per block to miners will halve.  normally this causes a spike in price as inflation goes down 50% thus sell pressure from miners which is considerable goes down to 50%. 
about the second part you're 100% right we just don't know when so prepare yourself mentally for long term holding.

That's not how value and pricing work. Bitcoin could be worth 1M today if everyone agreed to ask for 1M and no less and someone bought 1 satoshi at that price.

That's exactly what I told my wife. This is because of morons that took loans to gamble on crypto and then went crying to the bank when they defaulted because of the drop.

something like bitcoin if done properly could help transition from current to a better system. if we do crash it's be gruesome.
