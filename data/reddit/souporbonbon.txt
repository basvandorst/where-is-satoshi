Thanks, but I actually did have to google both anarcho-syndicalism and la Maslow's hierarchy, so I'm hardly speaking as an expert here.
That said, "anarcho-syndicalism" sure sounds like a government to me. One of the most basic human needs is security: I'd even put that in the physiological category in la Maslow's hierarchy, because not getting shot is a physiological need. (Also, the wide-reaching negative effects of high stress levels - leading to high cortisol levels - on individuals is well documented. I can drag up a source for that if you're interested.)
So this anarcho-syndicalist society would have to have a monopoly on violence (even if that monopoly includes all members of the society) to provide security to its members. At that point, they're already a government, just with the "anarchy" label slapped on the front. Making decisions via direct democracy doesn't make them not a government, its just that every member of society is part of that government. 
And direct democracy sounds nice, but in reality few people have the time or interest to make it work in most cases. I suppose it would be possible if the role of government were stripped down to its most basic function, maintaining a monopoly on violence, so there weren't 500 decisions every day people would have to vote on.
But I also don't see direct democracy as being able to extend to maintaining the monopoly on violence viz. external actors - running a military. It's too slow a way to make decisions, they would either have to choose somebody to run the military (electoral democracy) or get their ass kicked by the first hierarchical military that shows up at the gates.

That's why, for all the problems (and there are so many) modern governments have, the fact is that in many cases their monopoly on violence (viz. internal and external actors) has created the internally non-violent spaces which provide breathing room for the most prosperous and peaceful societies our species has ever known.

This was interesting, but does not at all convince me that anarchy is viable, let alone an improvement on the current systems.


This is tautological. He's saying that Somalia isn't a viable example of how anarchy leads to warlordism, because Somalis lack respect for non-aggression and "the law." How do we know Somalis lack respect for non aggression? Because Somalia is governed by warlords. He's assuming that some inherent feature of Somali-ness led to the warlordism, rather than a failed government and anarchy, but his only evidence is that Somalia has warlords.


This one is pretty accurate. I do in fact prefer my existing government, warts and all, to government by private warlords. That calculus could change, depending on how tyrannical (or, more to the point, invasive) my government gets, but as of now the choice is clear.


That's entirely beside the point. The warlord argument against anarchy is that, in a vacuum, governments will form with or without consent. He's talking about how things "should" be, rather than the real world.


The assumption here is that private agencies, operating under a profit incentive, would be driven to peaceful behavior by consumer preference and desire to conserve assets:


Well, we wouldn't. But we would expect the defense agencies to act in their own best interest, right? Sure, a defense agency **might** decide that its interests (profit margin, stock price, shareholder ROI) were best served by selling missiles rather than launching them. But it could just as easily decide that the marketing benefit of launching the missiles provided more value. It could also decide that the best way to maximize profits would be to set up an extortion racket: Either sign up for our agency, or we'll launch the missiles at you.  At that point, it's not longer the consumer's choice which agency to "patronize" any more than its our choice today what government we live under.
These anarcho-capitalist "defense agencies" would be distinguishable from modern states in two ways. First, they would (initially) provide only one service: that of monopolizing violence. This might be an improvement over the current situation. Certainly many modern states are exceedingly bad at providing many services. But it's also true that many existing capitalist enterprises branch into multiple industries, and there's no reason to think that these would be any different. In all likelihood, people would eventually "buy" (or be forced into) packaged services, providing street patrols, electricity, and water to neighborhoods. Ie, they would look just like today's governments, except that:
Second, these "defense agencies" would be operating on a pure profit incentive. Their express purpose would be to maximize shareholder profit, rather than the welfare of consumers. Current governments are, at least nominally, supposed to operate in the interest of their citizens. It's true that it doesn't often work this way in reality, but I don't see how that's an argument that we would be better off with the main militaries in the world being owned and operated by Comcast, Disney, and Phillip-Morris.

Where am I being illogical or knee-jerk? How would anarchy last longer than a week? 
@_date: 2014-04-24 02:16:18
And that's the scenario I described above: a scenario where there is no monopoly on force, but where everyone is armed, is going to soon lead to some group getting a monopoly on force. You can claim otherwise but it has never happened in the 10,000 years since humans started living in large groups.
@_date: 2014-04-24 19:34:16
I made a lot of assumptions to give anarchy the best possible chance of success.
@_date: 2014-04-23 19:12:38
In the first scenario, the fact that the garbageman has been elected by the community gives him some power: people who ignore him don't get a gun in their face or tossed in jail, but they will get social pressure from their neighbors. Soft power is still real power.
The second scenario you describe, "if everyone had a rifle and wasn't afraid to use it if someone aggressed on them," is the scenario I described in the long post above. A 1v1 gunfight is extremely risky for both parties, and it would be in both the aggressor's and aggressee's interest to have allies. As soon as two people make a deal to watch eachother's backs, that's a government of two people.
From there, it's just an arms race of organization. What's the best way to extort money from two guys with guns, or to defend yourself from two guys with guns? To make an alliance of four guys. Certainly it's decentralized, but each little alliance is a government. **Anarchy is ephemeral: it can't survive in the real world.**
@_date: 2014-04-23 19:03:20
But those 99% still have to organize some way to monopolize violence: otherwise they would constantly be at the mercy of the 1%. There has to be somebody with a gun to enforce the non-aggression principle, or else it can be violated at will by the violent 1%. And that's  the core function of governments: we pay police to monopolize violence, so that the rest of us can go about our lives. Modern governments are just an outgrowth of that basic function.
@_date: 2014-04-23 16:21:14
A government is not "the centralization of power" - a government is a group with a (near) monopoly on the use of force/violence in some geographic area. Central banking, rule-making, and even tax collection are not the core functions of government, they're add-ons. The core function of any government is to be the only guys who are allowed to use violence: to be the cops and the armies.
So cops and armies suck, right? We don't need either of those, so anarchy could work, right? Nope. Anarchy doesn't "work" per se - it never even exists for very long. **As soon as one group gets enough guys with guns working together, it stops being anarchy and starts being a (really shitty) government.** Anarchy is just a stepping stone to warlordism.
Let's analyze the possibility: **Say, tomorrow, the whole government disappears.**  Poof, no war, no nothing. Maybe we vote it out of existence. It's just a bunch of regular people, 99% of whom are decent peaceful folk who just want to go about their lives.
Without a government, a lot of services have been cut off. Private citizens step up, either by community agreement, altruism, or a profit motive, to do things like collect the trash and pave the streets. Eventually, we even manage to arbitrate disputes, like "I paid him for a car and he gave me a motorcycle," as a community. So far, so good. We don't have a real government: there are no cops or soldiers enforcing anything, just social pressure and good old fashioned altruism. **The markets and the community are picking up the slack, providing all the services that modern governments do.**
**All the services, that is, except a monopoly on violence.** One day, somebody gets just greedy, angry, or crazy enough to use this. One day you're walking to work, and there's a guy standing in the street with an assault rifle. He tells you you've gotta give him $50 to get by, or he's gonna shoot. This being anarchy and all, you've got your own assault rifle at home, so instead of paying him you go home to get it. As you're leaving, you decide you'd better get some backup, because 2v1 is much better than 1v1. **So you call up your next-door neighbor, explain the situation, and convince him to grab his rifle and join you.**
You guys go down to the street, there's a standoff, and with the help of your neighbor you run off the shake-down artist. The next week, the same thing happens, but now there's four guys in your street demanding money. Apparently the first shake-down artist went home and convinced everybody on his block to come join him. So you go around your block, and gather up five or six armed dudes. This time, nobody backs down: there's a firefight, and due to your superior numbers and cohesiveness your block wins the day. **Congratulations, you are now a government. You are a government of one block, just like every other group of five armed guys in the entire city** (the same thing has been happening everywhere else). 
Of course, being a government of one block sucks. You guys have to guard your block all day, and can't go to work. You explain the situation to your other neighbors, the ones who aren't part of your neighborhood watch, and they start giving you a chunk of their pay every week, so that you can guard them and eat at the same time. Most people readily agree to this - they're happy to go about their lives, knowing that keeping their block safe is your full time job. Now you have taxpayers.
Now, you and your buddies are nice guys. You don't demand money from anybody on your block: you go around with hat in hand. While most people support you and throw some money your way, there are a few holdouts, people who free-ride on the security you provide but refuse to pay taxes. But participation should be voluntary, so you let them slide.
The guys running the blocks to the north and west aren't so nice: You hear through the grapevine that they're not only demanding money from everybody, they're making a couple of the stay at home moms on their blocks clean their houses during the day.
This state of affairs lasts for a couple of weeks, until the guys to your north decide they want some more taxpayers. They know they can't take your block alone, so they go over to the west and make a deal with those guys. **They make an alliance, and suddenly they're a regional power: they've got two blocks worth of taxpayers, and 10 guys with guns. Everybody else has half that.** How those 10 guys make decisions amongst themselves is immaterial: it could be a democracy, it could be a dictatorship, it could be a gerontocracy, it doesn't matter. They're 10 guys with guns running two blocks, so they are the government of those two blocks.
To counter this new 10-guy army, you make a similar alliance with not one, but two nearby blocks. Now you have a 15 guy government.
**From here, things spiral pretty quickly.** Gun battles happen every day and various governments fight to seize new territory and reclaim old. With all the violence, people are afraid to go out on the street to go to work, so they sit hungry in their apartments. Parents are losing limbs, and kids are losing parents. 
**The competition between armed groups rewards effective fighting, rather than good governance.** Your nice guy approach to collecting taxes fails: the guys who take everything they can get their hands on are better paid, better fed, and better armed, and they eventually seize your block, killing everyone who was in your group. Likewise, those guys to the south, who used to make all decisions by majority vote? They couldn't match the discipline and quick decision making of the dictatorship to the west. They also get exterminated.
Armed groups battle, eliminate each other, and absorb troops and territory. The most effective commanders, who are often (though not always!) the most brutal and violent, rise to the top of the food chain. Your city is now a smoking ruin, your children are traumatized, and the only technology anybody bothers to maintain is the AK-47. Garbage and sewage build up, and in the filth disease becomes rampant. **When the coldest, cruelest, and most calculating warlord of them all manages to destroy his main rival and impose his iron will on the entire city, it comes as a relief.** The armed guys in the streets are all on the same side: They might be thugs, extortionists, and rapists, but at least the bullets aren't flying.
**And through all of that, you enjoyed maybe a week of actual anarchy.** Since then, everybody in the city has been living under a government. The difference is that you traded a modern government for that of Afghanistan, Somalia, or (best-case) Baghdad.
Anarchy is a power vacuum, and nature abhors a vacuum. **Somebody will step in to fill that vacuum, and when they do they become the government, and anarchy stops existing.** And the thing is, that as governments go, modern democracies are pretty good. We can't replace them with anarchy, not for more than a week or so, and what follows anarchy isn't utopia, it's a bunch of warlords and gangs running everything.

Then what separates anarchists from proponents of direct democracy? Edit: This is kind of my point. When people say "there should be no government! Anarchy is better!" what they often mean is "we should have a less hierarchical government," which is hardly the same thing.
@_date: 2014-04-24 02:10:31
Society wins when violence is uniformly diffused throughout? When violence is diffused throughout society you have Afghanistan or Somalia: places where people have to deal with violence day in and day out. Bad for women, bad for kids, bad for everybody. I did imagine that "everyone is armed as though it's an article of clothing" - that's the scenario you get above.
@_date: 2014-04-23 18:18:58
You're right, the scenario I described where the warlords win out in the end isn't the only way things could play out. **But my main point is that "Group A" is also a form of government, by definition.** Regardless of how they make decisions, or what other functions the government might perform, they have to maintain a monopoly on violence. That's the whole point of making a defensive collective, right? So that the only people who can use violence are members of the collective. 
As soon as you get a Group A or a Group B, or any other organization whose purpose is to monopolize violence, it's no longer anarchy. It's a government.
@_date: 2014-04-24 19:15:03
Who enforces this legal obligation? In the absence of a government, who is going to prevent a security service from starting a protection racket? It's true that we don't currently have a choice on who ultimately provides security (or as much leverage as we'd like over how it's provided, or at what cost). But the idea that all these armed professionals would play nice, that people in the business of providing force would abstain from using force in competition with eachother, is absurd.
@_date: 2014-05-04 02:41:31
What about somebody who values the gas more than they value the station owner's life? Or, to be generous, let's assume that they're not willing to actually shoot the owner to get some gas (or seize ownership of the whole operation). Maybe somebody does value the owner's life more than the gas, but values the gas more than they value the good opinion of the community. So instead of shooting the owner, they just threaten him. He has to hire guards or pay taxes for cops (and they're variations on the same thing) because he can't count on 100% of society forgoing the use of force.
Sure, at least 90% of the members of society are perfectly happy to exchange their money for gas. Hell, 90% is probably a conservative estimate - the actual number is likely far higher. But there are always going to be a few whose personal calculus makes the use of violence an attractive option.
In a society with a reasonably effective government, the security of  voluntary exchange is guaranteed (to varying degrees of effectiveness) by the government. It's the government's monopoly on violence that creates a healthy (predictable, secure) environment for voluntary exchange.
@_date: 2014-04-23 18:54:36
I mean, here we're really getting into the semantic details, but I think we're basically in agreement. I would look at that group, with voluntary membership, and no set geographic zone of control, and still  call it a government, though it wouldn't look like any government that I know of. 
Certainly, voluntary membership (while uncommon among governments) wouldn't make the group not a government. It's still an organization based around monopolizing violence. Obviously the purpose is to prevent or deter violence by outsiders against members. There are many ways such a group could control in-group violence: by allowing members free hand with other members, by excommunicating members who commit violence against other members, etc. The important part is that the defense organization is going to set those rules.
The tricky part is that they're monopolizing violence against members, rather than in a geographic area, which does contradict the definition I gave above. It's conceivable to me that the sort of organization you describe wouldn't have a set geographic zone: that members would be living amongst non-members, and that the organization would not concern itself with violence against non-members.
I'd still argue that they're a government, and that their zone of control is the members' bodies and property, rather than an entire city block or whatever. But like I said, we're getting into semantics rather than actual differences at this point.
@_date: 2014-05-04 02:57:35
Slavery isn't anywhere in my post, unless you're taking the stance that  everyone living under a government is a slave, which I suppose you probably are. (Which really just makes language less helpful in describing ideas and reality: my relationship with my government is very different from the relationship an 19th century slave had with the plantation owner, and calling them the same thing reduces our ability to talk about these things.)
I am supposing that violence - and hence, governments - are inevitable. Believe  me, I would love to be proven wrong. But I'm not gonna hold my breath, and until you have a more concrete proposal than waiting a trillion years (really?) I don't see there being much to recommend trying to get rid of government.
@_date: 2014-04-24 17:20:43
My problem with anarchy is that it cant work, because it will become government. And yeah, that governments are basically glorified protection rackets is something I completely agree with. I'm just not convinced there's any viable alternative.
1, for all its flaws, is actually doing alright in many places. On all sorts of measures of human welfare (life expectancy, literacy, freedom from violence, the list goes on), modern states are providing the best societies humans have ever lived in. Sure, there are a lot of problems, but this is the best real choice we have.
2 is not really an alternative until you have something specific. "We'll come up with a better plan!" is not a plan, it's a pipe dream. Believe me, when there's a better option than the current system I'll jump onboard, but that better option doesn't exist yet, and I'm not convinced it ever will.

Dude you've seen V for Vendetta too many times.
@_date: 2014-04-24 15:52:27
I'm going off Weber's definition of government, and of course there are others. Personally I think the "monopoly on violence" definition is the most apt because it points to the salient difference between governments and other organizations. For example, you have "creating and trying to uphold laws" - religions try to create and uphold laws, but in most cases churches != government. Having a monopoly on violence is what makes a government a government, rather than some other organization of people.
Second, it's true I am not familiar with anarchist literature (other than a little Proudhon in college). But the sort of organizations you describe don't sound like anarchy to a lay person like me. They sound like a government: they're a group with a monopoly on force, just the group includes all adult members of society. 
And I don't see how this "anarchist" government is going to be drastically different from the sort that exist today. How is this society going to "organize a common force" or be "controlled by neighborhood cooperation"? Is there something about their decisionmaking process that is uniquely anarchistic?
@_date: 2014-05-04 03:56:16
ok, in order:
1. So then, for you, state=monopoly on violence, government=state with a hierarchical structure? Others have said I'm using the terms wrong, but nobody has actually explained a distinction. 
It's true that I wasn't aware  how many anarchists want some form of direct democracy, rather than no government. Believe me, this thread has been an eye-opener in that regard. What separates anarchists from proponents of direct democracy?
2. Listen, if you're going to insult my understanding of economics and capitalism, you're going to have to do a better job explaining your ideas than "the collapse of the state is the simultaneous collapse of capitalism." How does capitalism require a state to exist? If anarchy is participatory democracy, how is that mutually exclusive from capitalism? I find it very easy to picture a participatory democracy with a capitalist economic system. Just because you read in a book somewhere that "the collapse of the state is the simultaneous collapse of capitalism," doesn't make it actually true. I'm gonna have to ask for some, you know, evidence and reasoning.
3. You've missed the forest for the trees throughout. "There is no power vacuum-- the anarchists fill it with their non-hierarchical government." - That's the whole point of the post, that power vacuums get filled by one group or another. The group's internal structure, whether hierarchical or horizontal, is irrelevant. I said as much in the most, and this whole paragraph kind of makes me doubt you actually read the whole thing.
4. An organized and well armed majority is a government, which is what I've been telling you about. Pretending that if they make all decisions by direct democracy we'll get some magically better society where everybody is free and nobody is oppressed is... well, it's idealistic, simplistic, and naive. (So is the idea that government by direct democracy could actually function, if I'm being honest. The historical examples you cite only prove my point - how many of those governments are still around?) Also, this organized and well armed majority riding roughshod over "minority tendencies" doesn't sound all that great to me, but ymmv.
5. Again, you've missed my entire point. That "their structures fill the vacuum" is my entire argument. That people will organize governments to fill the vacuum. Full stop. It's true, to color in the details I generally described the success of hierarchical, rather than "anarchist" groups. By focusing on this, you've completely missed my point, and written this whole wall of text saying I have no idea what I'm talking about, while agreeing with everything I said.
@_date: 2014-04-24 04:46:06
Ok what you said:
You have not, in any way, responded to my critique of anarchy. Instead, you've created a straw man "brainwashed and insecure adult" whose "beliefs about government are not rational but emotional in nature." "Government is your family... only in your mind, of course." Really, wtf does that even mean? And how does it relate to anything I've said?
Your only argument, in any of your posts, is that anybody who disagrees with you is brainwashed. It's a pretty weak argument.
What you are interested in is a nice turn of phrase, in being a poetic revolutionary. You sound like somebody who has seen V for Vendetta too many times, and not thought it through enough. If you had thought it through, your posts would be heavier on analysis (as many of the pro-anarchy responses have been) and lighter on the prettily-worded bullshit.
@_date: 2014-04-23 18:10:49
It would be the centralization of power. My point is that "government" and "centralized power" are not the same thing, and anarchy is not the same thing as "no centralized power." While many governments are a centralization of power, there are many different types of power, and many different types of government.
In the scenario above, consider three different groups. In the first, a couple of blocks get together, and decide to coordinate their trash collection to make it more efficient. One guy gets responsibility for organizing garbage collection for the whole area: he gets elected the boss of all the garbagemen. But the guy has no authority to use force/violence, he has to rely on voluntary or paid participation. This area has centralization of power in garbage collection, but it's not a government.
Now, on the next block over, everybody has a rifle, but they don't have any formal way of making group decisions. Some things get put to a vote, but generally decisions are made on the ground, people making things up as they go. Because this block has a monopoly on violence in their area, they are a government. But they don't have any centralization of power.
Finally, there's a third block. This is the more standard scenario: A government which is also a centralization of power. On this block, there are five guys with rifles, and they make decisions amongst themselves. They protect the grocery store from getting robbed, they keep the grocery store from charging exorbitant prices. They're a government, because they have a monopoly on force, and they've also centralized some powers, for example price-setting of groceries.
Centralization and government often go hand in hand, because centralization benefits governments in their core mission. (Maintaining a monopoly on violence: if they stop doing that, they stop being a government.) But **centralization of power and government are not the same thing.**
@_date: 2014-04-24 18:31:39
That's all true, but for the sake of argument I was assuming a highly-idealized scenario most friendly to "anarchism" as a lot of people describe it. ie, everyone is armed, most services are being provided  privately, there's no overwhelming force around being a government. The point is that even in that "rosy" scenario, anarchism falls apart and is replaced by government very quickly.
@_date: 2014-04-24 02:12:59
That's exactly what I'm saying. In the real world, you don't have the option of not getting a government. Either you have cops who want taxes, or mafias who want "protection" money, and it's basically the same thing. There's not some magic option where everybody in society is nice, and all problems can be solved with hugs and sunshine.

You're confusing your terms. The forces that took power in America in 1775 were a government wherever they managed to seize the local monopoly on violence from the British army. It took them quite some time afterwards to decide on the form of the state they would create. 
The purpose of the shootout is to decide the issue of who has the right to use guns against members of the community, and  the party that wins is a government. The issue of gun ownership is irrelevant: the government doesn't need to be the only armed group, just the only group that's allowed to use the arms against members of the community. ("Allowed" being decided by right of force.) You're right that I didn't explicitly describe the winners as making an announcement that outsiders would not be allowed to use violence against members of their block - I think winning the shootout has that implication.

While competition played a role in this scenario (unlimited resources still being the realm of science fiction), the driving force behind the proliferation of organized armed groups (ie governments) is each individual's need for security. Once somebody starts trying to use force/violence, competing groups will organize to protect themselves, and in doing so will form governments. It's true that economic scarcity would provide one obvious motivation both for the initial use of force that starts the cycle - the guy demanding a toll to pass the road - and the violent competition for territory between groups. But there are other motivations besides economic scarcity that people use violence and force, such as dogmatic religious beliefs, desire for personal power, or pure sadism. The list goes on. Even assuming a society with unlimited resources doesn't make government redundant.
The whole argument hinges on the idea that once one bad actor even threatens the use of violence and force, the rest of society will have to respond by organizing some way to maintain their own monopoly on the use of force, and in doing so they will have created a government.
@_date: 2014-04-24 18:28:19
You're arguing that a lot of the services governments currently provide would be better provided privately. That's a very valid point, but it's not the same thing as having no government. 
You say that security technologies protect homes and business better than police -- but what's the point of having a security camera if it's not going to call somebody? It can't just call the owner - everyone would have to just sit around ready to haul off to their property all day. People would outsource it, would pay a "private" security company to show up with guards when the alarm went off. 
Paying money to have armed guys show up in response to alarms? How is that any different from paying taxes to have cops show up?

See above for an example of a non-centralized government.
Your iceland example proves my point. (I'm assuming you're referring to the Icelandic Commonwealth, because every other period of their history has a very clear government.) **The Icelandic Commonwealth was not anarchy, it was a decentralized government.** From wikipedia:




That's a system of government, and furthemore, it's a decentralized one. The goði have monopolies on violence within their area: that's their end of the bargain. Inter-goði disputes were settled in annual meetings: decisionmaking power was decentralized (to some extent). 
You can quit commenting, and you can call this "the usual drivel", but so far you haven't given me any of these supposed pro-anarchy arguments I'm not aware of.
@_date: 2014-04-24 19:43:58
You're assuming that everyone in iceland is "like you," whatever that means. You're assuming that the general population has the desire, the time, and the training to go hunt down and kill criminals. You're assuming that a personal assault rifle is ample protection against a professional security service. You're assuming that nobody in society has a day job, that they are able and willing to devote all of their energy towards maintaining the NAP. Or at least, enough energy to protecting the NAP that they can outcompete guys who make it their full time job to violate the NAP. In reality, none of that shit is true, and people outsource (or really, are forced to outsource) the provision of security to governments.
