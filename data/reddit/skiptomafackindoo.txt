Lol - do me a favor and go make a new planet where no humans ever existed before. And then you can 'do what feels right'. All you want.
Tell me...does this place exist?

What do you think it's like in prison?
@_date: 2018-09-14 03:25:47
You said nothing. Shut up.

Except that what was said isn't true. Chinese, South Korean and US crack downs have significantly affected the price of BTC at various points.
@_date: 2018-09-03 23:57:09
Yeah? Tell that to the guy in jail for life that ran Silk Road.

Fiat is a tool

So you're saying the government figured out how to move it eh?
Sounds like your bullshit excuse is bullshit.

That was 2008...old news.

So, if a currency lasts a while we should stick with it?

Whether it is one moron or four insulting me, they're all still morons
@_date: 2018-08-22 04:22:57
Love this - I've been hearing morons predict the next crash since spring of 2009, they're still morons
@_date: 2018-08-22 07:41:53
Wow, you're smart. Did you come up with that all your own?
@_date: 2018-08-22 06:09:18
Who said we should do that? Sounds like you just made up a scarecrow argument for the purpose of protecting your prior chosen ideological position.
@_date: 2018-08-22 08:55:51
yeah...ill give first
@_date: 2018-08-22 07:13:00
Sure thing bud.
