They do have a warning up right now about Japanese Holidays. 
"Important Reminder:  Due to the New Year holiday observed by Japanese financial institutions between December 29, 2013 and January 6, 2014, deposits and withdrawals are currently experiencing delays.  For withdrawals, your funds will be placed into your bank account once your transaction has been processed."

Now if they would only support tying directly to your bank account for transfers in/out like coinbase does....

It seems like to me that if BitPay is going to offer one direction, they should offer the other.
Bitcoin users know that the market fluctuates up and down, we take that risk by holding coin, by selling coin, by doing.. nothing.. the market moves.
It BitPay allowed you to credit $1000 back towards the user, and whatever the current exchange rate was, then you could just credit $USD back, and let the spot rate refund an appropriate amount of coin.

I'd ask again, have you used the machine? Have you ever bought/sold coin on an exchange? You call that instant?
Instant buys happen as soon as your registration is complete, which is sub 2 minutes.
Instant sells happen only after you've transferred BTC into your WebWallet, which, true, takes the speed of the BTC network/confirmations.. Which isn't the fault of the ATM?
Transfer BTC into your WebWallet before you got to the ATM, and your sells are instant.

I love the idea - honestly wish more people would use it.. without enough hashrate to flatten out the bad-luck runs, people won't use it.. bad luck hurts more on less hashrate compared to a ghash.io or btcguild..

You'd think by now, BTC related companies would learn.
Communicate. Over communicate. Tell people what's going on. It's how you earn brand loyalty, and prevent... well things like happened yesterday.
Idiots indeed.
@_date: 2014-11-14 18:56:05
yes, I'm sure there's an element of fraud. However Purse.io does a couple things not done elsewhere:
1. Purse.io leverages credit cards to buy bitcoins.
2. Purse.io allows you to buy bitcoins with significantly less privacy intrusion than a exchange.
@_date: 2014-01-07 16:35:26
Unless your employer chooses to keep a running balance of BTC, and absorb the ups/downs themselves, then you've already made your statement about its' value as a currency.

Proof that even 2-3 people showing up, sitting down, and bringing public attention can force a multimillion-dollar company to notice..
@_date: 2014-02-28 17:00:50
Couple thoughts:
1. Do we know what the actual liability to users is? One of the documents called for an injection of 200k coins, I assume that's to pay them back? Let's call that amount $OWED of $TOTAL.
2. So if we know where the coins are.. (IE Cold Wallet) but nobody has the key... why not start a "DESCrack"/Distributed project to brute force the key. Let people connect their GPUs to a pool and hand out work like a bitcoin miner.
When the private key is found, split the rewards from the wallet up.. $OWED goes to whomever controls the MtGox company at the time, to repay users, and $WHATSLEFT gets split up among the miners, by shares contributed.

I've had it happen several times. Bitpay is awesome about it, the destination is generally clustered and confused, and will contribute almost all the delay to resolution.

In my humble opinion, any operator who tries to provide a Bitcoin ATM in the US of A, without collecting KYC/AML information is asking for SERIOUS trouble.
Trying to stay compliant isn't something you should blame on Robocoin.
@_date: 2014-01-03 07:40:43
automatic escrow like bitmit, and we'd be set..
@_date: 2014-09-30 22:02:23
Personally I love purse.io.. You can also buy Amazon items on purse.io -- just don't buy giftcards.

Transfer coins to your wallet.robocoin.com WebWallet before you head out to the ATM, and you can instantly get $cash$ out.
@_date: 2014-02-06 05:11:32
you can try. and your btc disappears.. but the "hash" they give for your transaction is never valid.. and your coin is gone. :(
selling for cash doesn't help - can't get that out either.
@_date: 2014-11-29 00:13:38
I hear your whole aversion to the web-based wallet, but I fail to see how what you've done is better than a fully working Robocoin machine. You've neutered it.
@_date: 2014-11-14 18:54:38
Purse.io is an awesome site.. just avoid gift cards.. too much fraud -you- end up eating.

Education time.
First off, It looks like they deployed a Robocoin ATM. The requirement for Govt Issued ID is imposed by ANY Bitcoin ATM from Robocoin, not unique to "PointOfCoin.com". Those ATM's, are in fact, 2-way.. Cash in, or Cash out. The fact they are 2-way separates them from lots of the little/cheap/portable ATM's. 
Secondly, The Bitcoin ATM's who are skating by, not requiring ID, at least in the US of A, are in direct violation of published federal/state Money Services Broker / Money Transmitter guidelines. Enforcement will come. Kudos to trying to do it legally!
Third, If you still think Bitcoin is completely anonymous, think DPR/SilkRoad..
I think it's great to see more Bitcoin ATM's deployed.. More education means more bitcoin users!
@_date: 2014-01-07 16:34:12
Perhaps escrow all payments for a period of time automatically? 
meets the elegance requirement.. :)
@_date: 2015-01-18 04:37:54
Not cheap, most expensive part is the float cash for bank, exchange, and ATM.

@_date: 2015-01-16 07:23:58
Sorry, wasn't trying to be a dick.
Your initial posting came off fairly strongly, and replies after even told people to avoid it, based on incorrect information. Seemed unfair to the ATM owner, who is obviously trying to make it easier for people to use bitcoin, something we call want.
@_date: 2015-01-14 20:34:04
nope.. been buying..
@_date: 2015-01-16 07:21:52
No, but lots faster, and the ATM's even with having to provide photo ID (like Robocoin units) are far less invasive than exchanges.. who now want ID, utility bills for 3 months, etc.
@_date: 2014-11-28 21:57:30
Kinda Pathetic. 
Robocoin is making the changes they did for compliance reasons, which is GOOD thing if we want Bitcoin to stay alive.

I'm not sure how using an exchange that doesn't require identification should make you feel safer? BTC-E is the least regulated, least known exchange of the bunch.
Think about it for a sec... the reason they haven't been hacked? It's owned/operated by the hackers... Where do you think most of the coins end up?
@_date: 2013-12-16 23:07:54
Because for a long time, they've been the fastest, and one of the cheapest at international wires, which places like Gox required.
@_date: 2013-09-29 04:42:18
I had a withdrawal pending for 3+ months (June - Mid Sept), and I finally canceled it and bought btc, and pulled THAT out..
Opened numerous tickets along the way, laughed at the responses.
Turns out Gox has lost more than $11M USD this year alone due to the Dwolla seizure and the failed partnership with Coin*** 
They're having liquidity problems. Get out while you can.

@_date: 2013-10-07 01:52:07
It's not a question of WHOM they should buy from, there are a lot of people with BFL hardware, making money. 
It's a question of WHEN, and how much $$/Ghash.. 
@_date: 2013-09-16 22:26:44
between the Coinlab losses and dwolla losses, it looks like Gox has lost slightly more than $11M USD... I think insolvency is a serious concern.
{edit: coin* naming confusion}
@_date: 2013-05-03 18:24:27
would be nice if your websocket could choose to ignore trades +/- a $$$ value you set.. 
Like 'ignore everything not +/- $10 of current" -- you'd hope it would cut down on the data send out from Gox, which would hopefully help the actual lag itself..
@_date: 2013-12-16 23:07:05

That finally explains something -very- odd that happened to me, so I might have benefited from your testing.
About two weeks or so ago, I executed two trades, within 10 minutes of each other. .. But the price difference was &gt;$10 a coin (in fact, the high price was about $5 higher than Gox).. 5 minutes later, it was back down again.
Thanks for taking the Whitehat path... it's not like we need MORE pressures trying to erode away the businesses trying to make enough money to keep doing bitcoin exclusive business.
