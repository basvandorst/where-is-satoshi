Dragon's Tale  is sort of just a casino, because it is games of chance, but on the other hand all the games are flavored and integrated into the world. No dice, no cards, nothing you might find in a real-world casino.
I haven't tried it, as I'm uninterested in games of chance. It is from the makers of A Tale in the Desert --  , which sounded rather more interesting to me, but I haven't tried that either.

I don't know what you mean about "have the money on a laser card". Money is stored in lasers in Ireland now? That's awesome.
But in any case, something like the following will probably work for you:
1. Load 
2. Once you've registered and logged in, click on "accounts", then click on the one labelled "Euro", with a picture of the flag of the European Union.
3. Follow the "Deposit instructions" to send your € to Intersango and have them credited to your account therein. I assume this will take anywhere from hours to days to take effect.
4. Once your account balance within Intersango has been updated to show that you now have €'s there, then click on "Buy/Sell", which will take you to here:  (You can also visit that link without having registered and logged in, and will be able to see other people's orders but not to place your own.)
5. Choose what price you are willing to pay, in €, for ⓑ. If it helps, you can look for information about what prices other people are paying for Bitcoin on other sites, for example  aggregates such information.
6. Enter an order to "BUY BTC", specifying how much you want to buy and what price you are willing to pay.
7. Wait and see if anyone takes you up on your offer and chooses to sell some ⓑ to you at that price. If nobody does, then either resign yourself to waiting longer while holding onto your €, or offer a higher price.
8. Once someone takes you up on it, then Intersango will show you as having more ⓑ and less € in your account there. Hooray!
9. Now you have the option to transfer your ⓑ from Intersango to your own personal wallet, making it safer against the possibility of someone stealing it from Intersango but more vulnerable to the possibility of someone stealing it from your personal computer. To do that, click on "Accounts", click "Bitcoin" and fill in your personal Bitcoin address and the amount you wish to withdraw.
You can also do a probably very similar process with other exchanges than Intersango. I chose that one to recommend to you because I have a good feeling about the owners and operators of it (they are active and communicative members of the community), they don't charge fees (I guess it is serving as philanthropy on their part and/or advertising for their consulting business), it is located "near" to you in geography and national politics I guess, and I've used it successfully.
If for some reason Intersango doesn't seem like the way to go, then I also recommend TradeHill. I've also interacted positively with the principals behind TradeHill and I've also used their service satisfactorily myself. If you use this loyalty code you get a discount off of their (already small) transaction fees and I get an even smaller kickback for having drawn you in:

Here's a riddle. Please post your answer below. I'll give 1.01011010 Bitcoin to the address that comes  with the answer I like the best.
First of all, let's define the ideal Bitcoin mix.
THE IDEAL BITCOIN MIX:
Suppose you take a bunch of Bitcoin from different sources, so there are K different Bitcoin accounts i = [0 .. K), each with a different value stored in it, V_i.
Now the idea Bitcoin mix would generate K new accounts, pay *all* of the value from the original accounts into one central (temporary account), named "X", and then pay V_i value from the X account to the i'th new account.
Afterward, everyone would have the exact same amount of Bitcoin as before, but it would all descend from the central X account, and before that it would descend from the combination of all of the initial accounts.
(Also the service would charge some fees so everyone's result account would be a tad lighter than their initial account.)
Okay, that's the ideal Bitcoin mix. Now here's the riddle:
THE RIDDLE:
Now suppose you put in some "clean" Bitcoins whose source is impeccable, such as freshly mined Bitcoins that have never been used for anything. These coins are as white as white can be. 100% white.
Suppose also that you put in some "dirty" Bitcoins whose source is as dirty as you can imagine -- how about a violent and dastardly physical robbery that caused the death, maiming and impoverishment of innocents. These coins are very dark black.
The riddle is: what color are the coins which come out of the washing machine?
Answer A:  "Whitening" -- All balances come out as clean as the cleanest balance that went in.
Answer B: "Blackening" -- All balances come out as dirty as the dirtiest balance that went in.
Answer C: "Greying" -- All balances come out the same color as each other, which color is some combination or average of the colors of the balances that went in.
Answer D-Z: YOUR ANSWER HERE

I used TradeHill and was satisfied with their service. In particular, I was able to withdraw all of my money after they announced shutdown, with no delay or funny business. I consider this a milestone in the development of Bitcoin: an online service shutting down cleanly and *not* "getting hacked" or otherwise disappearing with its customers' money.
I've also been using  and have been completely satisfied so far. I like how the Intersango folks are communicative and open -- I can see their names, photos and bios on the front page and on  and Amir Taaki blogs often:
Patrick Strateman recently diagnosed a security problem in a competing exchange -- BTC-E: 
I'm told that's not the first time he's done that. (If I were him I would've informed the operators of the exchange slightly *before* informing the world, but still, discovering it and alerting BTC-E's customers to it speaks well of him.)
I like the fact that they are open-source oriented and security-oriented.
At one point in the past they were publishing the source code of intersango on gitorious:  They seem to have stopped. If they resume that, this would be an added plus that would increase my confidence in them and their service.
I've also used this Canadian Bitcoin exchange:  . I've been satisfied with their service as well.

I would think if someone were in the business of performing such market manipulation, then they wouldn't talk about it in public. Right? Because that would make it harder to do it (again) successfully.
But pirateat40 has another business quite apart from this alleged market manipulation -- he runs a High Yield Investment Program ¹ called "Bitcoin Savings and Trust". I've read that it offers 7% per month interest. A HYIP is a kind of Ponzi scheme, in which earlier subscribers are paid by taking the investment from later subscribers. Those require a continually increasing rate of new subscribers to stay in operation.
If you're looking to attract attention from people in order to get them to subscribe to your scheme, it would make sense to publicly claim credit for moving the market, whether or not you actually had anything to do with it.

I tried to buy some. When I got to the payment step, Bitpay told me I had overpaid (because Bitpay truncated the price to 4 digits, and I had copied in the price from bitcoincoffee.com). Then Bitpay said I was all paid up and offered a link to send me back to bitcoincoffee.com. However, following that link took me to a login/registration page. I knew that bitcoincoffee.com had earlier said guest account was the only thing that currently works, but just to see what would happen I tried to register. It wouldn't let me register because the "State/Province" field was a dropdown selector with 0 options, but when I submitted the form it rejected it saying "Please fill in the State field!". So then I went back and looked at my shopping cart and the items I selected are still listed there.
So, I'm not sure if that worked. Please send me some coffee, thanks. :-)

I have not yet succeeded at getting money into Mtgox. Not for lack of trying! And I'm still trying, in part due to morbid curiousity. The latest step involves sending a quality scan of my passport and a bank statement to Dwolla. Still waiting to hear back from Dwolla if they consider this sufficient.
In the meanwhile, I've done plenty of business with some of Mtgox's competitors:   and  (Also I was a big user of TradeHill back when it was in business.)
If you want to get your $100 into bitfloor, the process is apparently to walk into a Chase bank branch and hand over the cash:
This is apparently free, and the description on that bitfloor.com page makes it sound easy.
Since I happen to be far from any Chase bank branch location right now, I've instead been using this free service named "Popmoney" offered by my bank:
Which successfully causes the money to appear in my bitfloor account a few days later and which costs no fees.

Okay, okay, you guys are all correct. You're smarter than I thought. Also, you're smarter than me, since I failed to notice that different-size inputs can be used to track causality.

I don't know if they have a solution for your deposit needs, but I've been satisfied with TradeHill --  . It is the second largest Bitcoin market by volume. They've given me good customer service, good uptime (exactly one outage, which was due to a DDoS and was quickly resolved), a clean and useful web interface, and I have a good feeling about their security and honesty. I know one of the principals personally on a "professional acquaintance" basis. That link contains my referral code, which gives you something like 10% off of the (low) fees, and gives me some tiny fraction of the fees you pay.

Currently, I don't believe that NSA (or anyone else) is performing automated, indiscriminate "active attacks" on users. By "active attacks" I mean things that overwrite other people's software or keys. NSA (and many other people from many countries) do currently use active attacks on specifically targeted users.
The purpose of the S4 product is not to prevent targeted attacks. If someone is targeting you, their best bet is probably to just seize your laptop or surreptitiously install a key-logger on it. Whatever techniques they use for their individual targeting, S4 is probably a weak defense against it at best. Because that's not what it is for.
The purpose of S4 is to raise the cost of mass, indiscriminate surveillance of entire populations. As far as we can tell, S4's current architecture is an effective approach to that goal.

Thanks for emphasizing the importance of software distribution in the security chain, jesset77. It is a critical but underappreciated fact.
The value offered by LeastAuthority.com is that you don't have to manage your own server. (For security purposes, you do still have to manage your own client, but that's less work.) Instead you pay us $50/month and you get a dedicated team ( to operate your server.
Also, in a sense your $50/month is sponsoring the development of the free and open source software, because much of the new source code for that project is coming from our employees, who are working on it during company time while getting their paychecks from our customers.
@_date: 2013-08-16 21:38:57
The server is (currently) on Amazon EC2. We might move it for performance and reliability reasons, but if we did that it shouldn't be anything you would have to do anything about as a customer. ;-)
I haven't looked into mega that much, but I know of at least two big differences between LeastAuthority.com and mega. The first is that all of our code is Free (Libre) and Open Source software. The second is that the client-side — the thing that you are relying on to protect your data by doing encryption on it correctly — is distributed through a variety of free and open source operating systems —  — which have their own controls (PGP signatures, etc.) to try to detect and prevent backdoors from being inserted into the software.
