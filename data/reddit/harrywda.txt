UK is leaving the European union and probably without an agreed trade deal. No one really knows what’s gonna happen

I have a business account with a bit of money in. if i withdraw it I pay tax but I can invest as the business, my business would own the investment. might be a way to retain the value of my money?

that’s a good video, i’ve not see that before. i’ve read the bitcoin standard so i know why bitcoin is so important, i just wish others could see it too

the inflation rate of bitcoin is literally scheduled to fall below the inflation rate of gold meaning its a better store of value. once investors realise this, and that bitcoin is way more easily divisible and much easier to transport than gold, a large % of the gold market cap will flood in to the bitcoin market. £1m bitcoin easily by 2030 in my opinion.

yeah, agreed. i stole the fact from wiki but either way a lot of people are watching the premier league
@_date: 2019-09-12 14:32:48
why is no one talking about how big this is? Watford are a Premier League team who play against the likes of Manchester United, Liverpool, Arsenal, Man City etc. 
from wiki: “The Premier League is the most-watched sports league in the world, broadcast in 212 territories to 643 million homes and a potential TV audience of 4.7 billion people”
it’s happening...

Thanks Phil, that’s a good answer. I have a nice amount of BTC and a good deposit for a house ready, however I don’t want to buy a house for the next couple of years. Do I just sit on the cash and wait til i want a house or do i take a chance on MORE btc. i guess the answer is not black or white
@_date: 2019-09-09 18:29:27
that wasn’t an answer... i’m also wondering the same question
@_date: 2019-09-05 10:17:07
nope, agreed. that’s where we have to be realistic. bitcoin will never replace gold. however if you were a gold investor and heard that there was a way to store your wealth better on software that has not been compromised in over 10 years of operation even against thousands of attempts, surely you’d at least have a deeper look...?
