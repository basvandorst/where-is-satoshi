New here I see. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:38:26
If you don't like it then why are you here? Go away and watch us chumps lose our money then. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:08:04
I think you're a douche who has nothing to contribute to any conversation. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:37:25
That's interesting. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:07:53
Yeah i'm super happy about 16k but I was hoping to buy some more today at around 13500-14 lol. Fucking spending limits cost me lol.  
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:50:49
Good luck
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:52:32
Out of all the trolls on this sub you by far made me cringe the hardest 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:18:27
I understand lol. I'm not even thinking of selling till at least 2019. I really do think 100k is attainable within 3-5 years. Going to be Rocky but I can see it happening. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:52:37
Coinbase is getting slammed. No way they were prepared for this amount of traffic. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:31:01
Do you guys honestly forget a fucking week ago when it dipped down to 14k and then shot up to 19k? It's a 10% dip. Shut up about Bitcoin being done lol. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:58:32
Jamie dimon and other cunt bankers like him are lucky we the citizens don't shoot them in the face. I'm actually amazed none of the people who lost money didn't kill anyone back in 08. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:08:41
Me too. I'm not even thinking of selling till it hits something ridiculous though. 19k is nice but the ceiling is so much higher. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:30:19
The dips are what make Bitcoin really fun. Strap in and enjoy the ride everyone. No one ever said it was going to be a smooth one. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:02:41
Do you have bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:26:57
Tell me when Mr finance expert. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:57:40
Mine took 7 hours last night. Don't worry. There are a lot of transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:04:40
So many people want to sell at 19k. I'm not selling till ll this shit hits a million. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:47:50
This thread has some of the most panic prone garbage advice I've ever seen. All the negative comments are from people who asked two days ago how to buy it. It almost looks like an astro turfing to get people to sell and panic.
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:40:08
Or it's coinbase. I send wallet to wallet and it sends fine. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:52:32
I love how it jumps 5000 then sits there with no activity. Definitely not sketchy at all. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:45:23
Holy shit did the price go down .03%? I'm selling all my coin it's crashing!! Fuck!! /s
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:10:03
Can you tell me how it's an enormous dip? It's up 3k today lol. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:04:56
No problem I was just messing around lol since you said survive. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:32:10
Uhhhhh hahahaha coinbase is such a piece of shit. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:57:59
Bitcoin is amazing. It's hilarious how something can be up 3k from not even 24 hours ago and people are talking about a dip. This is a lot of fun to be apart of. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:42:12
I recommend electrum as a wallet. It's what I use. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 17:51:03
I bought Bitcoin last year at about 600 and had 4 of them total to deposit on an offshore poker site. I ended up selling all 4 of them when it hit about 4300. I don't regret it. I would have done the same thing again probably. I never thought it would hit 10k. I thought for sure it was going to crash again and 16k looked like a lot of money. I reinvested that profit back into it at 7000 and then 9200 and am planning on holding though long term so let's see if that works out too. Could lose all of it now. Could be 100k in 3 years. No one knows for sure like you said. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:14:31
No worries. You'll be glad you didn't I think! 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:55:04
I have no idea what you just tried to write there but nice try. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:47:01
Yeah man great answer. That really helps. Thanks for expert opinion. I'll be sure to sell then. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:12:31
It was a joke. I know it's tough. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:31:11
Does Bitcoin cash say literally 0 for anyone else right now lol? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:49:54
God dammit was about to buy at 14 and it shot up so fast. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:34:40
If anyone tells you either way that they know for sure they're lying. Invest at your own risk. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:15:38
Korean exchange was hacked in case anyone wondering why such a sudden drop. Don't leave your coins on an exchange people! Do yourself a favor and move them to a safe wallet. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:13:03
You don't make any points lol you just say the same thing we have been hearing for 8 years about Bitcoin yet here we are. You are a troll and nothing more.
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:28:09
This literally just happened a week ago it hit 14000 and went back to 19. You're retarded. This happens every week lol. It's a 10% dip. If it hits 50% we can talk about it.
