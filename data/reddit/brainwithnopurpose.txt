They have a huge conflict of interest already. Not touching the code can easily be just as much of a threat as changing it.

I always recommend mycelium or coinomi. Both are very simple, you don't upload your private keys anywhere online, and they can be restored at any time with a set of 12 words from which everything can be regenerated at any time.

If they charged it to the company, it's 0 months and possibly dozens of them. Based on a calculator, it's about $10/day/unit. Otherwise I'd agree. I'm kinda curious to read about instances where this was found out and how. Drama!

That's pretty much word for word what they say about the other side in the other group. I personally don't have a definitive stance either way, but they seem to be doing something to improve it.

Why? I have a pin on mycelium, nothing is stored locally in the open or online.

Isn't it about control, not owning?
So "control your own money" ?
@_date: 2015-08-31 04:18:23
Yeah, just brainstorming cases where this can become profitable quickly.

I wonder how many IT people charge these things to their company as "servers" and then run it off the free power from the company, pocketing the coins.

Very hard if not impossible if done right. You can use one of countless coin mixers that randomize all the coins submitted to them and hand them out in pieces to non-original owners. You could use 20 different exchanges in 20 different countries to switch between 20 different cryptocurrencies including the extremely anonymous ones like monero/bytecoin, which will on every trade give you fresh coins with completely different history. And then of course there are in person trades that leave no paper trail. Lesson for me is to keep mine very secure, offline.

Would banks using bitcoin's blockchain basically ride the processing power of bitcoin miners and nodes without contributing anything?

You may be right, I don't know, why do you think LN centralization is not a problem?
@_date: 2015-08-17 11:14:56
I think you underestimate how popularized it has become as a concept. I heard people talking about bitcoin stuff from the movie "Dope" that came out recently for example. And it was all over the news last year.

This, exactly. There's only so much time in the days to learn things, and we can't be experts in everything.
@_date: 2015-08-31 04:50:59
haha, yeah yeah, but honestly that would be like way too much work for me to do, and I'm not IT or even close to it. And I make way more money than that would generate, so my main priority is to keep my job and move up.

I see it as a gamble short term due to whales playing the market, but a substantial chance to earn greatly in long term. But wow, 70%. That's quite a risk because you don't know if you're salary will be paid in the local valley or spike value.
@_date: 2015-08-09 01:02:51
it grew in value 3-10 fold since 2.5 years ago, that's very good any way you look at it.

It offered me to add a credit card for instant approval last time I used it as well, just like circle.
@_date: 2015-07-21 18:41:25
Ah, thanks for clarification. I was planning to try it next time, still better than waiting a week I suppose.
@_date: 2015-07-15 01:44:36
How? People die and you lose access to them, or they somehow lose them or forget how to access them. It seems like the total number of bitcoins that can actually be spent is always diminishing.
@_date: 2015-07-03 15:17:26
the fact that it could be and be used that easily to bring down a site is already pretty shitty
@_date: 2015-07-15 07:48:08
when you import it to multiple wallets, can all of them access the funds?
@_date: 2015-07-03 15:20:51
It's been up for weeks, it only went down during last fiasco, and this one. They also were being hit with ddos attacks during that time. They didn't even go down when they switched servers. Few days back when reddit was down almost all day, voat was working super fast.
@_date: 2015-07-31 04:04:10
Yeah, I just like the concept of 12 words holding my money, and the only privacy I care about is from strangers so I don't get targeted if I someday have a lot.
@_date: 2015-07-03 15:23:08
upgoat :)
@_date: 2015-08-31 07:40:00
Whoa. I figured this would be very tempting, wonder why I haven't read anything about it. Guess it has been happening. I see random posts all the time about people running these in colleges or w/e so they don't pay for electricity or it's fixed price already.
@_date: 2015-07-04 01:34:17
reddit had 8 years and still goes down almost every day during peak hours. voat was working fine until the traffic peaked yesterday, and during ddos attacks and sabotage from last fiasco.
@_date: 2015-08-07 05:07:28
Yeah, I was just thinking if I had root access and had to write code to gain control of BTC, it would be still be quite hard to get access to my private keys.
