Look up "fiat" to see why *you* look like a fool right now. Nevermind, I looked it up for you:






*Fiat* gets its value from some law requiring its use. Sometimes it takes more than just a law that says "these green coupons is werf money now." The US banned personal possession of gold for decades in order to force their fiat money to have value.
No government had to make a law to make 1 BTC be worth almost $300 USD. That valuation is just the result of market forces.
Numerous governments around the world feel it's necessary to ban Bitcoin to protect the value of their fiat money.

Surely, NY will expect you to do more than that to ensure that no New Yorkers use the site. They'll expect you to do KYC on everyone to make sure they're not from New York. If a New Yorker clicks "I'm not from New York" or uses a VPN/Tor, NY will come after you for not knowing they were from NY.
That's why BTC is crashing right now. NY just forced full KYC/AML rules on the entire Bitcoin community, worldwide, whether they use the traditional banking network or not, and whether they get a BitLicense or not.
