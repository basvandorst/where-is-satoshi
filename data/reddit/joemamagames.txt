Bitcoin loves all.
It accepts you and doesn't care who you love.
Bitcoin won't call you names.
Bitcoin is for everyone no matter what you believe in.
Anyone can use Bitcoin, but it won't tell you that you're going to hell if you don't.
CONVERT NOW (your currency to digital)!

Westboro Baptist Church was on the other side of the street.  I was protesting against WBC.

Got it.  Thank you so much for your support.

WBC's thing is protesting about homosexuality, saying it's the cause of natural disasters and other tragedies.  They were protesting the local churches, basically because many churches have become more accepting of homosexuality, and they consider them "fag-enablers" (their words not mine).  So any organization that is not extreme like them is a target of theirs.  Some say their goal is actually to be harassed, or to not be allowed to protest (violate 1st amendment), and then they sue, to raise money to keep the church going.  They bring a message of hate and so we countered with a message of love, Bitcoin loves everyone.
