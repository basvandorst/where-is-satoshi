Is this real, because I could buy/reserve one of these toady. Please advise.

I don't know but is it available through amazon? (serious)

Shit. Should I do this? I'd have to score the BTC first. Is this a good idea for a greenhorn?
I do have three computers I hardly use that I could use as a farm. But what would that get me? A coin a day?

From the article: “In the worst case scenarion, if [the DOJ] seize our domain name your Bitcoin will be safe because there’s no central authority controlling the currency and thus it cannot be frozen by any third party.”

I'll look into that. Not familiar with that feature. Thanks.

I mean like those coins with the hologram on the back but I'll look into that site. Thanks. And yes, a cash in hand exchange.

So is this card heplful?

Reddit gold. I know it's a stupid question but if I could "one click" it, I'm sure myself and many others would've done so by now.

Ok. Pm me at your leisure. We can iron out the details. I'm always in Lawrence. If you've been to Topeka, you know it's a stones throw.
@_date: 2013-01-26 15:58:17
Just if there are any in a short drive of me.
@_date: 2013-01-27 08:59:51
How safe is this and how would this work? The app store description was not for greenhorns.

If this is still available, I'd like to request this for PocketHobbit. He/she  is a great contributor to reddit, in my opinion.
@_date: 2013-02-02 02:54:54
Do you know anyone that's doing this? Can you direct me to a resource on how I could make this happen by tomorrow?
@_date: 2013-01-26 16:10:16
Not much. Maybe five, to start. I live in Topeka. Next Saturday is good for me if it's good for you. I'll even be in Lawrence, then.

Lol, well I guess I could just buy them off the site, myself. You've been very helpful. Do you read kindle books? If so, pm me.
