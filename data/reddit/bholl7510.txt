Yeah, it's all a matter of how much gain he has. But given how volatile the bit coin market is, there is the potential for pretty significant gains (which is obviously why its a tempting investment).

This is pointless and probably even counter-productive. He's just cutting out the actual act of taking his after-tax salary and investing it in bitcoin. The problem with this approach is that he now has to constantly sell/use bitcoin to pay for real-world expenses, creating taxable events which will likely be taxed at short-term rather than the more favorable long-term capital gains rates. Also, given how volatile the market can be, it would be really tricky cashing out so often without getting screwed. He would be much better off getting a normal salary and investing a portion of that salary in bitcoin.
This is in effect the same as getting paid entirely in stock. There are plenty of executives that get paid in stock, but it really doesn't make sense unless you already have enough cash on hand to cover your cost of living.

It's an interesting issue from a tax standpoint. As much as bitcoin supporters want it to be seen and used as currency, it'll end up costing them a lot in taxes if it is ultimately given that treatment by the IRS. Gain from foreign currency transactions are generally treated as ordinary income (meaning it could potentially be taxed at the top marginal rate of roughly 40%). In comparison, the capital gains rates on gain on the sale of a capital asset is only 20%. Thus, anyone with gains in the bit coin market are going to want to classify it as a capital investment.
