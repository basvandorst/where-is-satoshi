The crypto market is about $700 billion... yes it is big enough to cause a large scale recession at the least.

Bitcoin is already dead. It doesn’t deliver on a single promise.
Send money anonymously? FBI already proved it’s not truly anonymous.
Send money with low fees? Transaction fees are already climbing beyond $25/transaction, and when all bitcoins are mined the only remaining incentive for mining (and therefore validating the public ledger) is transaction fees. So they’ll have to climb to higher fees.
Not to mention bitcoin just purely doesn’t scale. A week ago when the price of bitcoin was making 20-30% swings in one day, transactions were taking over 6 hours to complete because of how backed up the public ledger became. Validating the public ledger is far too arduous and manual to scale.
Ps good luck telling people to stop selling bitcoin. When buyers can’t tell the difference between bitcoin and Chuck E Cheese tokens, you’ve got yourself a bubble that is GOING to pop

Ah yes, the most secure network in the world that has never seen any bitcoins hacked, lost, or stolen.

But bitcoin’s intrinsic value is $0. That’s not empirical wisdom.

Simply profound.

It is. He’s a neck beard who thinks he suddenly understands the most intricate market fluctuations due to his stint with a speculative bet. He uses words like “undervalued” as if that actually applies to bitcoin, then says stocks crash cause they’re tied to a company...
He’s a dolt.
