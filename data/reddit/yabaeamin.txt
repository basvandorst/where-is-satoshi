Btc withdrawals are paid my Gdax
@_date: 2018-01-03 20:40:11
GDAX IS litteraly the best exchange for me at least. 1 day delay deposits and withdrawals. ONLY 15 cents fee when Withdrawing money, and NO deposit fee. No fee on trading. For me its perfect in everyway exept the ID verification.

Same bro :( i bought high, stupid mistake. We will have to see!
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:53:26

@_date: 2017-12-11 10:00:57
R/BTC is cancer. Its all BCH loving, btc bashing idiots. Probably sold their bitcoins at 13k, and are butthurt.

No but what does this seed so? Is it your private bitcoin adress? Or what
@_date: 2017-12-09 12:17:00
Use Gdax
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:45:12
Dont buy from coinbase. They take so much in fees, and you wont get the right market price. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:00:43
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:59:35
Hahaha its fine. Its just a question thats keeps being thrown on this reddit. A bit of scrolling will find you the anwser
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:15:55
Thank god
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:21:36
Just fucking hold. Dont sell with emotions...
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:09:02
@_date: 2017-12-11 09:55:35
I know right. Have been profiting from these dips ! I bought a lot of bitcoin when it was at 14K
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:09:20
Hahaha its fine man :) enjoy your weekend!!
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:51:25
Just fucking hodl for gods sake. Leave your fucking emotions out. Dont jump out of the rollercoaster. The bitcoin rollercoaster has super high ups but also downs.. when you jump out you will lose out on the next peak. Just remember this
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:11:03
Fuck Gdaxs ID Verification system. It is litteraly the worst. Took me 1 month for me to order an ID, because i only had a passport and no Driving licence...
@_date: 2017-12-10 12:55:14
Just wait. It might drop more
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:11:45

@_date: 2017-12-07 13:34:35
How much did you buy?
@_date: 2017-12-11 10:53:59
Bitcoin is undervalued in my opninion
@_date: 2017-12-31 05:27:59
Dude just sell and shut up if you are that confident. "It wont get up" again right.
@_date: 2017-12-04 10:51:14
Just watched it. Awesome
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:06:25
I bought all time high.
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:11:32
More bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:49:33
1 word. HODL
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:45:56
Becauase you will bassicly get a discount because the market price is lower. Duhh -.-

Idkk broo. I am scared it will drop moreee
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:45:42
Needed 2 ID's for Gdax. Passport and ID card. Only had a passport... they made me order an ID card
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:28:15
That is what i tought. I cashed out when BTC was 14.600 euro. Its at 13.700 euro now. I want to go back in now, but i am a bit afraid of a dip.
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:42:28
I cashed out when BTC was 14.600 euro. Its at 13.700 euro now. I want to go back in, is this stupid??
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:00:44
What is this "seed"?
@_date: 2017-12-09 11:56:47
How did you lose it ??? Buying high selling low??
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:14:23
I saw him on RTL Late night, really cool dude! Also a family guy!
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:00:26
Yeah i know, but 18640 is the target price for the sellers right? Isnt that to low?
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:43:30
Same story here. I verified with my dads IDs on Coinbase, which automaticly unlocked gdax for me. Dropped 300 euros at 9.3K euro, and it was a good decision :)
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:09:38
Should be a lot more then 1 btc ���� dont know for sure
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:23:48
Done bro
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:37:20
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:46:40
It is supply and demand. The correction is just people selling
@_date: 2017-12-04 09:55:05
I mean they are both cryptocurrencies. If Zimbabwe already started colaborating with Dash, who knows what the future will hold!
@_date: 2017-12-09 12:04:53
I dont want to be rude, but how can you be so stupid...
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:40:52
Same here. Just hodl
@_date: 2017-12-31 05:32:25
RemindMe! After 1 year
@_date: 2017-12-09 00:44:09
Also 17 y.o btw. I do money withdraws and deposits from my own bank account btw.
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:25:10
Just google it 
@_date: 2017-12-11 10:01:36
Same bro, dont look at the charts and HODL. Buy at dips, dont sell. I have 100% faith in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:26:01
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:59:23
Definitly. On Gdax you wont have a single fee at all. 0% (use the limitbuy function, market buy has a .25% fee)
Also, you will save a lot on the buy price, because the buy price is usually higher on coinbase.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:45:32
Like i said :)
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:47:52
I am being realistic, not optimistic all the time. I am happy i bought in at 9000 usd some weeks ago. I am buying in tomorrow at around 15K usd. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:46:26
Gdax is the best
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:58:23
Its profitable depending on how much money you invest. Dont expect a too big margin though.
@_date: 2017-12-14 11:18:39
Hahaha awesome shit ����
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:17:42

I think he is talking about the futures market opening. I dont think it will negativly impact bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:26:23
I would say wait till tomorrow. Thats what i am doing. If it doesnt dip anytime soon just buy and hodl
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:32:15
You broke rule no. 1. Hodl. You will regret this.
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:08:24
Because the dutch media is litteraly shit
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:54:38
I sold. Cant take this shit anymore. Lost a fuck ton on LTC. My crypto story is done!
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:04:27
There wont be an apocolypse
@_date: 2017-12-04 09:44:11
I put 1/3 of everything i have into this. This better work out.
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:23:26
If i knew i would have been rich!!!
@_date: 2017-12-09 12:07:45
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:48:33
This is getting fucking annoying.. i swear ��
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:04:49
Gdax with 2 IDs will increase the limit to 15k
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:31:22
After a week of trying, yes. I had to fucking order an ID which cost me 80 euros. It was worth it in the end
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:47:40
Why does Money have value? Its paper?? Why does gold have value?
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:01:06
I just bough 3K euros in the "dip"
@_date: 2018-06-10 15:57:27
If he sold his btc at its peak, he would have had 80 million dollars
@_date: 2019-02-19 14:01:05
$$.... nice prank
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:56:20
Are you jelous?
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:07:35
Sure ;)
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:48:47
If it were that simple, i would lend 1 million dollars from the Bank right now, and double my money. We know nothing for certain man. Untill there is a permanent fix for the fees and long waiting times, bitcoin is a scary, fulitile crypto.
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:50:45
It is. It just shows how fulitile the coin is haha. Its amazing. Litteraly like riding a rollercoaster. To dangerous for me though, i dont think we will break an ATH untill the fees are fixed
@_date: 2018-02-02 11:26:19
Sold at 18.5K. Did only invest 1k though. Its been a fun ride :)
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:44:36
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:24:13
I will be back. I wont leave BTC forever babe
@_date: 2018-02-02 07:54:08
Are you jelous that you sold at 8k and bought at 19K ���� i dont have to proof myself dude.
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:09:32
Thanks man, trying to be realistic here. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:55:59
Ofc fees are low, when there is almost noone using BTC as a currency ATM. No shit
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:50:07
You can probs even see some comments of me in november when i bought
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:45:54
If in the future LN will get implement in the mainstream, then sure. RN the market is all over the place.. i mean from 20K to 8.5K.. thats nuts haha
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:49:43
What makes you think i am lying haha. I bought at november at like 10k and when i saw it was 19k i was really happy with my profit. I got like 900 dollars profit which is not even close to a Lambo ���� why would i lie 
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:51:46
Thats true ���� i am not a liar though.
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:08:39
Well congratz mat3
@_date: 2018-12-12 13:57:29
28? I am confused.
It went from 30 dollars to 2 dollar. That is 15x less. How do you get 93.33?
@_date: 2018-12-14 16:25:48
If he researched for months i hope he knows how to but bitcoins in his wallet ����
@_date: 2018-12-20 06:56:55
Thats illegal tho ����
@_date: 2018-12-12 14:02:59
Yeah i get it now. Its the percentage lost compared to the price. Thanks
@_date: 2018-12-12 12:36:31
30 to 2 is 93% ??
@_date: 2018-12-14 08:51:34
Bitcoin gave me PTSD attacks
