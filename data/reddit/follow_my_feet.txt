That's not at all how bubbles work. The recession came out of the fact that there was *too much* support for an increasing housing market and an increasing demand that came from the top investment banks for more and more mortgages to be put into MBSs. Everyone can be wrong.
Like you say in your other comment the concept of Bitcoin is an idea and not just a coin but investing in Bitcoin means you are investing in the coin and not the idea. And also like you say it the idea that people have gotten behind and the idea is what has vaulted the price up so high. I can invest in Tesla because I'm excited about the emergence of new all-electric cars but if someone else comes along and does it better my money that was tied up in the idea is worthless because I invested in the company and not the idea. What if the future crypto used in daily life is one that hasn't even been created yet? That $10k Bitcoin you own is worthless because all anyone wants to accept is the new coin.

People say it's in a bubble because many people have invested in Bitcoin with the belief that they will sell it off at some higher future value for a gain. Like you've pretty much said people don't believe in Bitcoin's potential because all it is right now is potential. It will never be widely used with its current volatility levels as the general population is risk-averse and that volatility likely won't decrease until Bitcoin is less of some future potential and more of a known quantity. At least that's my thoughts on it. It's really difficult to say whether it's in a bubble or not because that can only really be known after the fact.
