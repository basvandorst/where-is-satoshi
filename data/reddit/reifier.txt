The market isn't going to manipulate itself. How else am I going to buy low sell high at large volume! ;)

Was your bank listed on their drop down list? Then that is why... my bank is not listed 
@_date: 2018-01-12 21:28:29
only downside to gemini is they archaically make you call your bank to initiate a wire transfer manually instead of just taking your acct number/routing unless you are on their "green" list. Dumb, I remain on coinbase until that improves and I'll jump ship. Probably unlikely, we need more options for bank account -&gt; crypto in the USA.

Why the fuck do you stay with BofA when credit unions are free and pay you back for all ATM fees? Not to mention they don’t completely freeze all your accounts when you travel and don’t treat customers like shit 
@_date: 2018-01-12 21:41:50
Nothing personal but, FUCK BofA! I’m using a credit union 
@_date: 2018-01-12 21:58:13
Gemini makes you wire manually first and if that works then you can use a ach (assuming your bank isn’t on their drop down list of banks)

You are amazing, great to see this kind of humanity coming out of crypto! Please consider donating to diabetes research. This is one study I’ve been involved in that is 20/25million funded testing a possible cure:

Gemini wants me to call my bank and setup a wire transfer manually like this is 1965, nope

Hey it’s me the 500th subscriber 
@_date: 2015-12-28 20:29:46
This is a myth, hard fork will happen faster than people think once there's consensus from the core devs who somehow think this isn't their call
@_date: 2015-12-24 18:08:25
What does this mean? Any significance other than being a round number?
@_date: 2015-12-28 14:26:14
I think the value in BTC is not as a fast/charge-correctable payment processor but as a rock solid audit-able money transfer hard currency. I foresee my bank account being all BTC and using it just like I do my checking account. I can see paying off a credit card bill with BTC but buying a soda with BTC seems like a battle we don't even want to win in the short-term.

Why can't you load this software onto your own Rasberry Pi ???

Dogecoiner here, congrats and great job brothers and sisters!

@_date: 2014-09-08 19:29:19
I'm curious, why are people expecting this announcement drive the price down and not up?
@_date: 2014-05-31 03:48:19
Would love to see some vids on crypto currency for programmers like a technical / code based video walking through an open source crypto / mining setup would be really cool
@_date: 2014-09-08 19:37:08
Hold on confidence and future growth potential? Is everyone holding btc just a day trader or something? I'd hate to see what happens when you get bad news! 
@_date: 2015-01-20 17:27:04
Is there a real reason why everyone dumps btc to good news constantly?
@_date: 2015-01-20 17:51:37
So basically any demand gains are negated by the massive speculation market selling into minimal gains?
@_date: 2015-01-21 13:40:43
Ya I guess insider trading rules don't  apply to btc?
@_date: 2015-01-22 19:18:32
Not really, they are asking for experts to explain something to them, seems legit. If I was 60 years old I wouldn't be up on new tech either. At least they are listening
@_date: 2018-06-14 18:19:36
Maybe founded with BTC VC money?
@_date: 2015-08-06 14:45:53
Except if tcp/ip could only process 7 transactions per second
@_date: 2015-08-13 12:43:53
Amen! Hard forks build confidence in future development and community collaboration. All this bickering is bad news 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:57:53
Haha no kidding, same thing happened to me. Just return it as string instead 
@_date: 2015-08-11 14:58:59
That is such a myth. I can build a car that runs off of a custom fuel I develop and it may be great but there's no way I'm going to fill up the tank anywhere on a cross-country trip. 
The reality is bitcoin users/businesses look to the dev team for guidance. They always will. If there's no one in charge the coin will die due to stagnation
@_date: 2015-08-04 11:18:32
Stagnating in the name of financial stability sets an awful precedent. I'm excited by the future of Bitcoin but if it is too big to hard fork for needed code updates this will surely be bad for the coin long term
@_date: 2017-11-09 13:39:15
@_date: 2015-08-11 17:03:35
The average user of bitcoin just sees headlines of developers bickering 
@_date: 2015-08-11 14:10:24
If you can't hard fork the coin is already dead, innovation moves too fast for bullshit like this to hold us back
@_date: 2015-08-11 16:33:18
If the core devs said we are hard forking on X date to increase block size it would be fine. Everyone is reluctant to fork to XT not because they think it's bad code but because it isn't coming from the core team as a cohesive plan. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:57:12
Except when you go to show someone a price on Blockfolio and oops they see your total portfolio balance ��

I don't think it's quite the same level... I sent a gchat to my gf today who mentioned hiring a house cleaner within 30mins I had an e-mail offer about house cleaning
@_date: 2015-08-11 14:08:42
This whole situation reflects on the core dev team extremely poorly which is bad for Bitcoin 
@_date: 2015-07-17 17:56:48
Not with such high txn confirmation times :/
@_date: 2015-07-20 14:07:06
Ya I'm really hoping it doesn't end up to be fight-club 
@_date: 2015-07-29 16:32:32
being anonymous and not easily traceable is problematic for Google's business plan
@_date: 2018-02-10 17:04:15
Same thing happened to Napster and Silk Road...

Loving the Dogecoin tshirt :)
He does have a point with confirmation times though, 10mins is wayyyy to much. Gotta start using Dogecoin !

The IRS wants to know your location
@_date: 2015-09-01 15:20:34
It probably means you cant enter a class-action but TOS are not above the law it's the other way around...
@_date: 2015-09-01 12:22:40
Fuck the TOS if it violates net neutrality it's void in court
@_date: 2015-11-20 15:08:33
BTC is honestly too slow for that :/
Maybe something like dogecoin could be used since you can more reliably count on &lt;10sec confirms 
@_date: 2017-05-21 13:45:22
If that's true and you held till now it would be over 9Mill usd 
@_date: 2015-03-20 17:21:19
Ah ok, makes sense. So in that case you'd only have to wait for deposits/withdrawls 
@_date: 2015-11-20 15:40:43
Unfortunately, we cannot yet offer the Shift Card to residents of MA. Stay tuned, we're working on it!

Lol for 20k he's probably ramble on about making it our national currency 
@_date: 2015-03-20 15:32:01
DogeTipBot has been doing this for a while, good to see btc catching up on some of this stuff. How fast does changetip happen though aren't the btc confirmation times too slow? Dogecoin is closer to 10secs

I always thought satoshi was one or more people from CIA/NSA using it as a vehicle for computers to fund them via supercomputer downtime
