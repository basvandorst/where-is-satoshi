Cold storage you'll have to pry from my cold dead hands.

This is a question I ask myself frequently.

It's dropped below 6000 and bounced back twice within 24h. Maybe this is it. 
@_date: 2019-04-14 15:04:31
Compelling argument.

Will this be work at your own pace or scheduled? I'm familiar with JavaScript and C++ basics and would love to get into coding crypto/blockchain for a career change. My work schedule is so wild that it has taken far longer than I had hoped to get to where I am.

I buy a percentage of my income monthly no matter the price. I'm terrible at trading so I just HODL.

Bad! Don't think independently! Be a slave!

Technically this applies to money in banks, gold in storage, stock in a portfolio, etc. Any can be seized if not with you. Best to store it all in crypto and hide it.

1 BTC = 1 BTC. It just hurts to see the conversation to USD go down after buying.
@_date: 2018-11-24 23:20:23
This best be a trap cause other wise we all fucked!

I'm an optimistic person but damn son. You may have me beat.
@_date: 2018-11-24 23:21:21
That too!

I'm a firm believer of a digital future. Bought more BTC yesterday.

I've been hearing this too. July is supposed to be a lit month.
Or are is the rumor mill just gonna kick the can a bit further until we are in autumn?

It's a beautiful thing to see BTC climbing again in the morning. Can we has mega bull run meow?
@_date: 2018-07-24 14:46:14
Bulls on parade!
@_date: 2018-07-24 03:42:05
There is no dip when holding forever.
@_date: 2018-07-24 03:33:47
Lots of volume here for BTC rn. Also talk on twitter regarding a bull run if we can break through ~8300. Good luck all ��

IMO these articles are written by two types of people. Those who truly don't understand what's happening to technology and its ultimate effect on the real world. And those who know exactly what's going on and are trying to deflect.

If there's a reason to spend Bitcoin right now it's to be financially independent tomorrow. Congratulations! Everyone else can have their toys while we have our BTC and freedom.

There's always a warm feeling in my stomach when I open my market app and it's all green ����
@_date: 2018-07-02 17:34:59
Super bullish now. So please start pouring in the money! *positive vibes*
@_date: 2018-07-27 01:58:29
First time I've checked all day. Was hoping to come here and celebrate. That won't be happening now unfortunately.
@_date: 2018-07-24 20:45:47
The image was most definitely uploaded from the moonbase.
@_date: 2018-07-08 05:35:07
Nice to see it up and holding today!
@_date: 2018-07-05 02:45:16
We pushing towards 7k one step up at a time.
@_date: 2018-12-18 04:53:18
Holding right along with you. Such a great post! Thanks for your view on Bitcoin. I totally agree.
@_date: 2018-12-24 03:38:11
You won't regret it. It's a great way to make a little extra cash when you need it.
@_date: 2018-12-24 09:31:29
Maybe when we are over 9000 again.
@_date: 2018-12-26 08:03:21
Understanding what it is and could bring: joy.
Bitcoin in 2018: sorrow.
@_date: 2019-05-10 19:18:13
This by far ��
