Yes, when caught (rarely), it is MUCH easier to detect this sort of thing with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-03-01 03:20:34
Not if you lose all ability to prove to your bank who you are. That is the private key you have in btc, and you can make as many backups as you want and store them as securely as you want.
But yes, it is a little different, I just don't see that as a bad thing. For example, I lose cash and it is gone, no backups.
@_date: 2014-02-28 15:17:15
The whole point of bitcoin is decentralized. You can store it yourself (on your computer, paper wallet, brainwallet, etc). Anyone turning around and letting a random online service be the sole holder of the private keys representing their BTC holdings is totally missing the point in my opinion. 
I understand using exchanges for.......exchanging but I cannot for the life of me understand why anyone would STORE their BTC somewhere like that.
So it's future is people (hopefully) realizing that you don't have to have a bank with it. 
@_date: 2014-02-20 21:51:01
Well, I'm sure SOME will. Some people also trust astrologers, suckers are born every minute. But I don't think they will be mainstream.

Another explanation is that he eventually expects to have to make an announcement that will trigger people to be violent.
@_date: 2014-02-20 21:48:22
He pissed off a lot of people who I assume have more money they he gained from this, and who likely are not the sort of people who you want to piss off.
@_date: 2014-02-28 18:25:14
I used all of my bitcoin to buy reedit gold back when they were worth nothing.
I eventually started laughing :)
@_date: 2014-02-20 12:31:32
I  suspect they plan to make an announcement soon that will lead to not so peaceful protestors.
@_date: 2014-02-20 19:08:16
Of course not, but the nature of the blockchain means it is also a lot harder to hide.
It isn't like this kind of thing isn't also frequently happening in regulated markets....
@_date: 2014-02-20 23:13:42
Depends on what we are taking about. If it is him skipping town with the btc that is clear cut. If it is the original topic of this post and him taking advantage of insider knowledge to sell btc then that is less clear.
@_date: 2014-02-28 05:24:08
Coincidentally the 3 I use! Perfect :)

Are you suggesting bitcoin devs are not here or that they are not competent?

This hasn't been my experience in the world of finance.

Overstock figured it out.
@_date: 2014-02-18 17:46:39
They have outright refused to answer the direct question: "Do you still have everyone's bitcoins?"
This tells me it is somewhat likely that they don't.
@_date: 2014-02-18 20:45:58
It also assumes Bitcoin rebounds from this, which I think we all assume it will, no thanks to MtGox.
@_date: 2014-02-20 19:01:24


Instead he and his company have zero credibility with the community anymore. Reputation is everything here and what dolt would trust MtGox or anything Karpeles is remotely involved with ever again?
For that matter, I consider the Bitcoin Foundation to now be untrustworthy due to their continued relationship with him.
@_date: 2014-02-20 21:50:10
Actually it appears he is already getting scared. And he probably should be. I didn't lose any money on this (what is the point of bitcoin if you are just going to use a bank?), but I bet some wealthy/scary/unscrupulous people did. 
@_date: 2014-03-01 02:08:29
Anarchy has a lot of definitions. 
@_date: 2014-02-18 17:48:28
I think many people would LOVE to leave MtGox as soon as they can. But until you can withdraw (assuming MtGox HAS their BTC still), you really can't leave them.
@_date: 2014-03-05 18:38:22
Aw, that's not fair, they are going to go to the moon before dogecoin does :)
@_date: 2014-02-21 17:22:03
Never saw breaking bad, and let's not make assumptions as to what I do for a living and know. 
And I'm sorry, what strawman are you attributing to me regarding suggestions? I'm suggesting regulatory enforcement is community based (exchange acts bad like this insider trading, gets bad reputation, loses trust and relevance). 
That is different from someone outright stealing, which would be regulated by.....you know....actual laws against stealing. If he is cashing out millions and not planning on releasing his customers' money he has legal as well as security problems given the variety of people involved in BTC.
@_date: 2014-02-20 19:07:03


That's a bit of a stretch. I cannot imagine anyone ever trusting MtGox again after the way they have handled this. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 06:06:19
Unless ordered not to.
@_date: 2014-02-20 19:03:24
Bitcoin is a community, we enforce it. 
Do you think anyone is ever going to trust MtGox or Karpeles again? He is done.  
@_date: 2014-02-20 13:10:22
People trust all kinds of crazy crap. Tarot cards, faith healers, etc.
@_date: 2014-02-20 23:15:26
I don't think it would be redditors, but I also don't think that btc is not used by less savory characters (drug dealers, organized crime, 4chan users, etc)
@_date: 2014-02-28 15:18:47


I agree with the latter to an extent, but not the former. There are plenty of bitcoin advocates who would never dream of storing their BTC on some kind of exchange or online bank where they do not have the private keys. It literally defeats the entire point. 
@_date: 2014-03-03 13:16:18
Perhaps that was the point...
@_date: 2014-02-18 17:58:59
Interestingly enough, it can be both. 
It's been known for a long time that txids are malleable and should not be used in the way MtGox (with their custom software) is using them (and expecting them to be static). TXIDs basically have two states, they are documented to be malleable prior to confirmation and static after confirmation, MtGox mistakenly assuming them to be static all of the time. It's both a poor design that should be fixed because it allows you to do stupid things, and a problem with MtGox's implementation that they SHOULD have designed for. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 23:30:48
Fair enough, but not a perfect analogy. Someone can steal my private keys but they are encrypted (and backed up). The btc isn't actually there, they are in the blockchain. The private key is more like a debit card (which people do keep at home) only with a better PIN.
@_date: 2014-02-25 12:15:27
Because there is regulation with fiat money and this kind of thing has never happened.....
@_date: 2014-02-20 21:52:07
I'm sure Russian mafia, drug dealers, etc type people will just let him live a life of safe luxury. 
If he sprints with the money, I give him a month tops. 
@_date: 2014-02-21 17:10:28
That's speculation, I'm not convinced this isn't just a continuation of a very feeble and technically incompetent attempt to save a business they didn't understand how to run in the first place. 
However, if he splits town with the money, I hope he has Snowden-level evasion capabilities, because it is not unreasonable to assume he would have stolen from some shady figures (who is so naive as to think drug dealers, Russian mafia, etc are not involved in BTC?) who don't have jurisdiction and extradition red tape.
@_date: 2014-02-20 13:58:59


Or people noticing that they have refused multiple chances to respond to the direct question everyone has been asking: "Are you solvent, do you have our BTC?"
@_date: 2014-02-20 22:32:07
Well, arguably it isn't illegal. 
@_date: 2014-02-18 17:27:20
That is awfully optimistic that he will be able to withdraw coins ever from them. At this point they should probably be treated as incompetent/scam until proven otherwise. 
@_date: 2014-03-01 02:05:11
How do you figure? Because bitcoin doesn't have a government regulating body then there are no laws whatsoever? Theft is still theft.
@_date: 2014-02-28 18:22:21
A better question is why they didn't just use it like an exchange and instead pretended it was a bank.
Do people treat forex accounts like savings accounts?

It depends on what your goal with Bitcoin is I suppose. If it is purely speculative, sure.
