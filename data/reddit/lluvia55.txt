I just downloaded the OSX update but the files where created on August 22. If it was updated today, shouldn't the files have today's date?

Sure, but look at the price

I understand what you mean. 5s and 0s tend to be easy to punch in sell orders. I fear for $4500 because of the oversold readings, I agree that $5000 seems more likely to be the trigger for a sell-off. Unless the price moves sideways for a couple of weeks and long term indicators go back to neutral, we're on dangerous territory. We'll see, weekends are always large in volume.

It was a slight pullback. Back in June, the same thing happened, it hit  $2933 and then pulled back a bit just before hitting $2980. It was all downhill from there for about a month. Rock bottom was $1830 and then it went back to an uptrend.

We'll see

Good one. Why would I be warning you, though?

Many people don't buy as an investment, they buy at low prices to sell at high prices. When the price hit $3000 many people sold in a short timeframe, so the price dropped a lot. That went on for about a month (back in June-July). After it hit a low at around $1800, a buyers came back strong, so it rallied past $3000 and now the next sell off zone is close to $4500, maybe more. Just be careful with your money, guys. I'm no banker, I just researched enough to understand a bit more than I did when I started. Good luck, everyone

Evidence is that it's very much oversold, if the uptrend continues, especially with large volumes, it will bust. No asset can sustain that, not even bitcoin (judging from past performance). You can't expect the market to stay bullish for so long without huge profit taking between $4500 and $5000
