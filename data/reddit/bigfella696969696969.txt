yeah, my point was basically what u/TheLepos highlighted.

sure. my reading comprehension is at fault.
not the fact that you aren't able to understand what i wrote.
yes, i would absolutely hire someone fresh out of a CS degree. for a junior position or an internship.
which is already leagues above someone without a CS degree.
but if i had to choose between a fresh CS graduate and someone with four years actual work experience in the relevant field, guess who i'd choose?
now i'm sure you'll say, "but if the CS graduate had X amount of years experience they would get chosen"
yes, but that isn't what we're talking about.
the "high horse" in IT comes from the fact that many people in IT are simply telling you their experience. stop being so angry and defensive, it makes you ugly. get off *your* high horse.

I think you're taking what he said a bit personally. 
What you seem to think he said was: 
"Nobody is ready to enter the workforce after 4 years of college"
What he said was:
"4 years of college does not immediately qualify you for non-junior positions, and in fact most people still require a couple of years to get used to how to actually work in a tech company before they are truly ready to begin advancing"
And what he said is largely true. You don't need university to be a great tech employee. 
Does it help? Yes, absolutely. Tech graduates have a wealth of knowledge that is incredibly valuable.
Is it absolutely necessary? Not at all. Drive and a willingness to learn and test things is the key for advancement in tech. I know *so* many senior engineers in a multitude of tech fields with no relevant degree.

you're absolutely right. a CS degree is totally valuable, given it's from a real college or university. and it gives you such a great, vast understanding of so much of information technology that if you're a good learner, you can adapt to new tech and different roles far easier than your average IT worker without a CS degree.
but as you said, it's the beginning and unless you're coming in the top 5% of your class you're still only really prepared for something in a junior position to begin *really* learning.
a lot of the senior guys (think infrastructure architects for some of the worlds largest multinationals) started out in helpdesks, stayed focused, and slowly worked their way up.

not sure if you're serious or not..
mt gox was the biggest bitcoin exchange in the world when i signed up. it was plagued by difficulties, hacks and suspicious activity.
i was one of the first people to receive the blunt end of this in 2011, when they were hacked for what i believe was the first time. before this, it was largely seen as a safe option for trading in and holding your bitcoins. 
never hold bitcoins in a third party wallet, no matter how trusted or secure they seem to be.

then mtgox got hacked and i lost it all. :(
