Um, no, it's the person's responsibility.

It's value to you would be that you can sell it for $839 in your scenario. It having worth to somebody else can be the value to you. 
I don't smoke or drink, never have, but my food storage has a little of each of those items because I for see that they have value to others, and that could benefit me greatly someday. 
Crazy that you wouldn't spend $1 to acquire a good you could sell for $839, only because you don't want to pay taxes on the profit.

But what if the half of the pizza you were given was to grow to be twice the size of the original pizza? 
You need to take price into the equation.
@_date: 2013-11-28 03:33:32
And how is this any different than me getting screwed on my regular income? It's almost like reddit just discovered what paying taxes really feels like. It sucks.

Wouldn't even take close to 80%. More like 20%. That would probably constitute a bank run. 
And, in terms of cash, many branches only hold $25k. Any more than that and they appreciate advance notice to coordinate it. Source for this is my dealings with my own bank.

Nope, no IBR/loan forgiveness. Just paying it back. Stinks, but that debt allowed me to have a job that I love.

You didn't purchase 1 coin at $480. That's where you go wrong.
You purchased $480 worth of BTC. When the order went through you received that $480 worth of BTC, which was 0.55 coins.
There simply is no other way to do it.
@_date: 2013-11-28 13:56:39
There are bid orders and sell orders on the side, so it means something...
@_date: 2013-12-04 01:02:16
Excellent choice!
@_date: 2013-12-02 21:24:48
Go get a job like everybody else that is struggling and broke. Buying gifts for others should be the least of your worries. Help yourself first and then others. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:54:13
I can now log in (took a lot of attempts for the sign in page to load) and the price is listed as $665. Who knows what is going on. It doesn't build confidence, though.
EDIT: Just realized that I logged into my account and never received the 2-factor auth text code on my phone!
@_date: 2013-11-20 18:57:10
Not working for me either. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 13:58:56
It's been due that for a long time. I don't think the paper price of gold will ever be as high as the price of physical gold should be. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 14:27:09
You have it backwards. Bids are bids to buy, asks are what the seller is asking, or willing to sell it for. You may have been sarcastic, I can't tell in my old age anymore. Sorry if you were.
@_date: 2013-11-28 20:26:41
Institutional investors may be more likely to contribute funds once BTC exceeds the gold price.
@_date: 2013-11-24 05:25:18
What a stupid post. A reminder of what? 
@_date: 2013-11-20 14:43:39
You can still add any phone number to the 2FA list. When logging in it will send you a text message, but you can always click "Code not working" on the screen where you enter the code. You then have the option of having them call your phone with the 2FA code. Sometimes when I don't receive the text I have them call me. It's an automated call and it works perfectly.
@_date: 2013-11-27 16:12:59
Wow, I remember that like it was earlier this month. Wait, it was!
@_date: 2013-12-02 21:26:30
@_date: 2013-12-03 21:43:37
But $98,510 is absolutely out the question. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 22:31:42
PUBLIC sentiment of the lay person is an indicator, but not the sentiment of a forum dedicated to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-19 16:09:33
He's not an idiot. He's looking for a way to make money. He can be long bitcoin and still short it. Geez, if we had a way to short it I would have from $900 to $600, then taken those profits to purchase more bitcoin.
I hold long for many commodities and then short them on a daily basis. Not because I don't believe in the long-term fundamentals, but because I understand how a market ebbs and flows and how money can be made in both directions, assuming that is my goal.
@_date: 2013-12-02 01:40:07
Doing awesome. It's at $1075 right now. I bought more at $888. Good call. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 01:13:45
He's a libertarian who is stuck in his ways. We all get in a rut as we get older. Not an excuse, just a fact. Ask yourself this: if you were 60 years old would you care about BTC?
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:48:05
Very down for me. Not working on iOS or on the web. Saw a buy price of $476 briefly on the website.
@_date: 2013-11-20 01:02:17
You are all wrong. It's simply
X = terrorism. 
That way, none of us can make a stink about it. We can't question anything. It's for our own good!
@_date: 2013-11-24 22:18:04
Such a dumb question, but what wallet app is OP using in that image?
@_date: 2013-12-03 02:58:47
Good point. I think he's gotten comfortable with his business and resistant to change. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 14:36:52
Eeew. Helping each other is gross.
@_date: 2013-12-02 21:34:17
Best of luck to you. It takes hard work and discomfort for most of is to make our way in life. And then, when we think we are safe and sound, a curveball is thrown our direction and it feels like the works is crashing down upon us. That's when some give up. Rise up through that and you'll be a more refined individual and you'll recognize that you are capable of more than you thought possible. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 20:07:46
Oh, no doubt. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 22:40:06
Because he's a great libetarian, and to be honest, Bitcoin should be a wet dream for him. That's why this is so frustrating. BTC is everything Schiff could hope for, he just won't do his homework. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:58:49
Thank you.
@_date: 2013-11-28 13:53:11
WTF?! The price he sold them at would make him a billionaire. Why would he care what happens to the price after that if he cashes out?
Also, when an asset is sold it doesn't just go to an excess pile. For there to be a sale there has to be a buyer. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 03:36:38
It works sometimes! I switched from text 2fa to using Authy. 
@_date: 2013-12-13 01:08:15
That's what genius does. It implements parts of existing things and does it very well. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 23:56:16
The 2fa is great, but I've logged into my account NUMEROUS times (20+) over the past 3 days without any 2fa being sent to my phone. That is worrisome.
2fa is secure to the extent that it actually works. If it works sporadically then...
@_date: 2013-11-19 04:03:09
Indeed. Still crazy that for that period the 2-fa wasn't needed. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 17:24:48
For every seller there is a buyer and vice versa. There will be great deal of support at $1000 now.
@_date: 2013-12-02 19:07:19
BTC is tough because support/resistance don't act entirely like they would in traditional stocks. The volume is simply too low.
@_date: 2013-11-28 04:03:19
Yes, we should never discuss things we have a vested interest in or food we enjoy or movies we like or anything else.
@_date: 2013-11-28 04:05:18
You cannot function on a daily basis relying solely on BTC. It doesn't work. Yet. 
@_date: 2013-11-13 20:48:28
I also have the title of "doctor" and have over $420k in student loans. I've been paying them in full for the past 4 years. I basically have monthly payments of $4500 for the next 315 months.
@_date: 2013-11-27 17:26:03
I've bought every day this week. I purchased 2 hours ago. I bought a week before that and the week before that and... you get the picture. Never had a problem with any funds. The only issue was 2fa text was failing, but I switched to Authy and all is well.
@_date: 2013-11-25 03:36:07
I'm not, but I've switched from text 2fa to using Authy. Now it just works. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 16:13:48
Nobody has to wait 20 minutes for a coffee transaction to clear.
@_date: 2013-11-28 23:53:53
Based on the patterns OP is posting, it will sell off and then move higher. Sounds good to me. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 16:27:19
Love Coinbase, but the 2fa text hasn't worked for me for several days. Finally downloaded the Authy app for 2fa and I don't have to worry about those texts anymore.
EDIT: for clarification, sometimes I would never receive the text, other times my account would just login without requiring any verification to be entered. Either way was not good.
@_date: 2013-11-28 20:23:46
Agreed. Gold and Bitcoin are a libetarian's wet dream. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 13:40:58
LOL. It's a bit coin sub. People are excited. Go back to your cave. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 20:25:39
Split it evenly. .5 oz of gold and .5 BTC. May not be the fun way to do it but it's good to have multiple assets. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 17:37:21
The first sign of a crash is simply the price going lower, which it does on a minute by minute basis. You can't time that. If I were you I would sell now and lock in your profits. It appears you don't know what you are doing, so the likelihood of you getting burned in some fashion is high.
