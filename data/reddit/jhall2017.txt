None of them stole Bitcoins name and try to destroy it though

Yeah I agree, that's what the Bible says too. Its a bad thing, not good. 
@_date: 2018-09-02 16:04:19
Correct, one world government will come, just as the Bible predicts. With a one world financial system. Exactly why I believe blockchain is here to stay

There is fear before you are born again of hell and death. Which is normal when the understanding comes that we have fallen short of a Holy God. Once you are born again and know you are saved, then there is no fear in death. As the Bible says:
There is no fear in love; but perfect love casts out fear, because fear involves torment. But he who fears has not been made perfect in love.
I John 4:18 NKJV

Apparently 3 Bitcoin Cores then?
1. Roger calling Bitcoin, Bitcoin Core as to diminish it
2. The alt coin fork Bitcoin Core
3. Full node client software  (just learned this now)

Interesting, thanks for the reply :)

Interesting. I'm so curious what else people were saying back then to compare to now. Do our posts now seem close to when it bottomed? Or were people more negative etc? So curious what an old timer like you saw. 
@_date: 2018-08-18 16:41:32
Exactly. People point at anything except the fact it went parabolic and a correction will happen.

What about Bakkt? Apparently way bigger than an ETF and not far off.
@_date: 2018-10-02 00:28:56
Probably OTC

Pretty sure its already faster now since then. One big reason is more have integrated segwit. But there was graph a few days showing how transactions equal to when we were in the bull run and how its soo much cheaper now. Also I don't think there is any reason to believe BTC crashed outside the fact we were vertical and people take profits. What goes up must come down.
@_date: 2018-10-27 21:10:07
Another scam, great

How so if an ETF allows retail to buy in, add to 401k etc? People buying (if they do) would only increase the price.

Just watch this, its long but addresses this among other issues that are brought up:
@_date: 2018-11-15 03:30:46
Demise, why do you think so? Love to hear your thoughts. Thanks 
@_date: 2018-07-11 01:14:27
If we do the same. Moon time soon, near EOY maybe

Wire it out?
@_date: 2018-07-17 20:33:35
Usually not. I did hydro airdrop early 2018 and it ended up being worth $4k but usually they are only a few bucks.
@_date: 2018-07-22 21:27:41
Missing Hydrogen

Taxes must be killer on all those trades
