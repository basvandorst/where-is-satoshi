I was thinking the same. Don't know why you're being doentvoted. I don't get this forum sometimes. They say they want deecentralization but then findwl work around that make Bitcoin more centralized. They say it's a store of value but then want it fast and cheap.
Mods don't ban me. This is the truth. I know this forum censors like crazy.

GPU mining is profitable. Just swap into btc I've heard of people complain about ant miners expiring quickly also. They breakdown quite often.

What do you mean? 
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:12:28
Agreed. Bitcoin should just keep it's " store of value" gimmick. There are other instant / free currencies out there already.

Finally something he says I can get behind!

Why wouldn't we just use something that has already been completed. Nano is absolutely free to use and infinitely scalable. Lightning is a joke compared to nano. Keep Bitcoin a store of value aka digital gold. It's time has past as a currency. Even bcash tried an failed.

Fundamentaly Bitcoin really has nothing but a first mover advantage and brand name. Polishing a turd ( bcash) isn't really doing anything. Bitcoin just uses to much damn electricity. Is expensive to use when things get busy and takes forever. Lightning Imo is overcmpicated. Nobody wants to use Bitcoin as a currency rather just hodl ( store of value) which is why I'm moving on the currencies that can fundamentaly work for day to day. Downvote away... This is why people are moving away from this community.

Bitcoin has kind of lost it's ground with the blocksize/ lightning workaround. I mean bcash actually is worth something which says alot. I wish Bitcoin was still the same old Bitcoin years back. I think we're all better of moving to clean/free/instant tech. While I still hold some btc because it's a "store of value" I'm moving on from this dinosaur mostly to other currencies like nano and likewise smart contract platforms like eos. I will by a little on this dip but I'm not really a believer in what the devs are doing to Bitcoin. Bitcoin should at this point just stick to the store of value. Trying to be a currency again at this point after losing it's more momentum is pointless I'm. Feel free to downvoted my opinion.l but I believe it to be true.
