I think this is more in the realm of a juvenile white lie no? Especially since it’s between siblings who probably don’t share the same pot and feeding the same families

Maybe a social engineering trick on your sister... tell her you'd like to buy a stablecoin, so you can purchase easily on the internet.  Show her its the equivalent of $1=1coin (doesn't matter which).  If you can convince her to do that for you, then the crypto-world is your oyster :)

Another thing that bothers me.... I don't seem to remember bitcoin-qt having a password locking on a wallet file.  I thought back in the day if you had the wallet file you didnt need a password cause the wallet.dat wasn't encrypted... ? Maybe my memory fails me
Looking through the change logs, wallet encryption was only introduced after version 0.4.0 and before that the keys were saved unencrypted.  So that might be an attack vector into your old private keys.  Are you sure that `bitcoind dumpprivkey` doesn't just work without asking for a password?????
And obviously before trying ANYTHING, backup the current wallet.dat in its current state and version so that you have that for the future.  Even before trying the above command.

Another bit to think about.... looking at Lastpass from around the time of your wallet creation, how long are the passwords created? It stands to reason that you probably left it on default and if its relatively short maybe brute force might not be as unattainable as you'd imagine.

and fwiw, you mention this thumb drive and the bitcoin binary not being touched since 2011.  Do check the version of your wallet file, maybe there has been a vulnerability, maybe some other useful info you can glean from the file itself.  
Try creating a new wallet file with that same old binary and let others try to help you break the password of this new wallet you created for which you know the password.  That might steer you towards a path to retrieve the old password for the old wallet file

Why don't you just open an account at bitso and try bits by bits... each time withdraw it right away to your own wallet with keys you control.  That way you don't become a target in case someone was corrupted at bitso and at most you'll risk fraction\_of\_X/X at a time...
