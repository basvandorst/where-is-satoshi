Well then... I guess we where typing at the same time.

I'm not quite sure what you mean with "on the lower graph", however you can clearly see that Jochens [backup node]( drops transactions and the [primary node]( doesn't. This is best visibel when looking at the ***Mempool Size in MB*** chart.
This is the default Bitcoin Core behavior once the mempool reaches the *maxmempool* default value of 300MB (important: this is the system memory usage for the mempool and not the same as the ***Mempool Size in MB***). It drops low-fee transactions.
I guess Jochen increased this value on the primary node, just not on the backup one. (maybe he even can confirm this My node for [ drops transactions too. I have decided to keep the *maxmempool* value at the default 300MB, because I think most nodes on the network use the default. However I don't have data for this.

Use the sliders below the chart to specify a time range.

This is the important point. Comparing transaction count between 2016 and 2018 isn't really a useful metric. In the past year things have changed and many businesses have started batching their user withdrawals and payouts. This is the exact reason we introduced the payments metric on [transactionfee.info]( Thanks for pointing this out.

Nice to see some more people working on similar projects. I've seen you around on twitter and reddit. Keep on posting and maybe get some unique stats that nobody else does show yet. Traffic will come with time. Best of luck.

*real life* transactions

I guess you are referring to the [Inputs &amp; Outputs per Block]( chart.
Are you familiar with the UTXO\-set \(Unspent Transaction Output Set\)? Basically the set of all transaction outputs which haven't been spent yet. You spend UTXOs by sending a bitcoin transaction. A transaction can spend one or multiple UXTOs \- so called inputs \- and can create one or more new UTXOs \- so called outputs. When more inputs are being spend than outputs are created the UTXO\-set gets smaller. If more outputs are created than inputs are being spent the UTXO\-set grows.
In late 2017 more outputs where created than inputs spend. This was likely due to new people getting into bitcoin and exchanges / services not perfectly handling bitcoin deposits and withdrawals, so that sometimes very small \(like only a couple thousand Satoshi\) UTXOs were created. This caused the [UTXO\-set to grow]( As you've correctly seen, this changed mid January of  2018 \(compare the Inputs &amp; Outputs chart and the UTXO\-set chart around 18 Jan. 2018\) and [continued]( over the next few month. Most likely since some services realized that they had to [consolidate some of their UTXOs.](
So more inputs than outputs typically means UTXO\-set consolidation.

We've introduced the *payments per day* metric on [transactionfee.info/charts]( to visualise exactly that.

p2sh.info calculates the percentage based on transactions, we calculate the percentage based on payments.

Essentially yes. Native SegWit transaction use the bech32 address format.
