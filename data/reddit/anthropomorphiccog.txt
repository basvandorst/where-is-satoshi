You're bringing up a good point about deflationary currencies. I've spent a lot of time trying to wrap my head around this. It would essentially eliminate the -need- for investing because savings and thrift would provide riskless economic certainty for individuals and nations. Outrunning debt obligations through growth goes out the window.

The US tends to enforce sanctions through the "swift" financial system -basically just cutting off certain accounts from using it. I suppose there's an implied military threat behind that, too.

Unfortunately, this isn't true. Unlike the agriculture futures markets like corn and soybeans, participants in a CME futures contract don't have to deliver the actual commodity at the contract date. They can cash settle. So basically, CME acts as a bookie between two betting parties, for BTC anyway. Ownership of BTC need not happen for either party.
Sorry, not trying to argue with you. Just wanted to point out why every BTC person hates CME bitcoin futures so much.

Look, I just skimmed this article and so I might be missing something, but I think the big idea here isn't *payments* but rather *price hedging*. Futures markets were invented for buyers and suppliers to agree to contracts in order to remove price volatility. That Bakkt would do that for point of sale nationwide is a big deal because it means they can transact in BTC without having to worry about currency risk. Multinational companies do this all the time with foreign currencies at a macro scale.

Agree. This is why I believe BTC was invented to be a global reserve currency by design by John Nash (btw: "peer to peer electronic cash" could just as easily describe a decentralized version of the SDR, one that's not issued by the IMF or any governing body, could it not?). If that's the case, then I think it's absolutely brilliant because all the official authorities spent all their time in the early stages worrying about Silk Road, individuals, etc, when they should have been worrying about the meta game.

I get your point, but it would be much more efficient and easier for them to hedge with the CME futures market than to hold actual BTC.

So, yes, they'd hedge, but with futures, like every other company that needs to hedge risk against a commodity.

You are right that with BTC it becomes impossible for a government to directly take money from one person and give it to another --they have to do it indirectly through the threat of imprisonment or whatever. But I think the trade-off is that the government can't also fuck over the poor through unfair monetary policy that promotes private profits and socialized risks, discourages savings, encourages debt burden, promotes American maximalism, etc. Not to mention the waging of forever wars...

It doesn't technically need to replace all the fiat monies in the world. When John Nash wrote about ideal money, he more or less said that such a currency would force nations to stop abusing their people with their own currencies. Because game theory.

You're right, good point
@_date: 2019-06-25 15:28:45
If the next bull run takes BTC to an ATH that is an order of magnitude higher than the last ATH, which has been the pattern so far, then the average daily rate of price increase is something surprisingly high... like $100-200 per day on average. I was thinking recently that the bursts of price increase were happening too quickly to be sustained, but if you look at it through that lens, then they seem to be on pace.
Of course, these bull runs tend to go vertical in the last few days, so averaging isn't the best way to look at it.

Exactly right. There's no way the first blockchain, the first creative solution to a thousands of years old problem about how to reach agreement in a trustless environment, would ever go to zero. At the point that a "more useful" crypto comes along, BTC *at the very least* becomes expensive art.

Fiat money puts the government as the "lender of last resort"... which really means, banks can keep the profits for themselves when the loans pay, but close up shop and leave others holding the bag when they don't. With Bitcoin, an entity could still issue loans that go bad, but they alone will have to live with the loss.
So behavior changes.

"limited utility outside of high risk investing"
If you need a small component in your portfolio to be completely uncorrelated to other asset classes, then it has utility. It also has utility if you're a trader and want to run TA all day long against currency pairs and you don't care about the fundamentals.
@_date: 2019-06-11 14:28:46
No, you shouldn't use them. Futures trading is completely different from stocks and you can get wrecked really fast because the accounts settle up each day. The margin requirements on most brokerages are still pretty high, even though the asset itself is leveraged. I really recommend leaving the futures market to commodity traders and just buy and trade crypto on crypto exchanges, or, better yet, move it to cold storage and just hodl.

From what I've read, they are using it for both value-store and for transactional currency. So... Are people in Zimbabwe buying BTC on the exchange and keeping some there to transact with one another (off the Bitcoin blockchain)? That's what I'd do... move the majority to my own wallet and use the exchange's app to transact day to day. If that's what's going on, then (to me), it validates the LN off-chain scaling model.

You are right. Loan activity would decrease significantly in a sound money system because the lender would have to assume the total risk involved. This is different from our fractional reserve money system because the government is the fallback (reference ~~the last~~ any financial crisis, also reference the genesis block). So certain groups of people get to benefit from gains and push losses to others. Heads I win tails you lose.

I haven't read this paper because it's behind a paywall. But it kind of makes sense because if BTC functions as a similar role in a portfolio as gold, then you would want to protect (hedge) by taking an opposite position, and apparently they're saying .7 is the best ratio.

At first glance, yes, but individual and group behaviors would change drastically in a world with deflationary reserve currency -wars would have to be paid for with sound money, for example. ZIRP and NIRP would no longer foster environments where the 1% can increase the wealth gap, etc. Basically, people would spend money on things that really mattered and fools would soon be parted with theirs. It's a fascinating thought experiment.

Not worthless, because the trust actually holds private keys to real BTC. However, it will probably not trade at a premium anymore since it will not be the only way to "hold" BTC in a retail brokerage account (futures market notwithstanding).

You're not wrong, because a society that has a deflationary base currency would look extremely different than what we have now. I believe Frogo was getting at the idea that the current lack of sound money requires that we (collective "we") constantly seek growth for the sake of outrunning the relentless debt that's behind our money supply.

I was in college during the dot-com bubble, but IIRC everyone *believed* that internet ecommerce would be the primary means of consumer trade in the future. Not really wrong, either, just early. Seems like in order for crypto to have a full-fledged bubble, we'd need the same kind of unanimous belief that decentralized crypto is the future of value transfer -rather than just "the blockchain technology unpinning bitcoin, etc etc. In order to attain that kind of unanimous belief, some really crazy stuff would need to happen: like crazy people getting elected, fundamental problems in the monetary systems of nation states, debt loads that can never be offset by growth, potential for serious war, and the like.

Basically your account is marked to market every day even if you don't sell. It's just as easy to take a short position as it is a long position.

But I think that's the same reason why the USA won't live in that state indefinitely --other countries receive benefit if they can slip in and establish their currency as world reserve. There's always an incentive to do so.

The real problem here is that the central banks can and do influence spot markets through futures trading. Basically, they create money, open a bunch of positions in the direction they want the spot to go, apply enough pressure to create a common knowledge of what's happening to momentum, and then close out their positions. You can enter and exit positions in any direction at any time in the futures market, and it's even easier when you're the sole body that gets to literally create the quote currency.
They do this with equity indexes all the time. They're called the "plunge protection team" in colloquial language.

GBTC is a trust that holds BTC in cold storage. You can invest in it through your retail brokerage account by buying it over the counter (might need to call the brokerage to do so).

Its limited supply implied a deflationary currency from the start. Maybe go back and look in the genesis block again if you want to see what this is all about.

The guy's post was about withdrawing $17k in cash, not interbank transfers, genius. And bragging about bank-centric fintech in any country probably won't impress many people on this sub.

You \*raise the debt ceiling and create more debt obligations and then the Federal Reserve (which is not part of the government)\* prints more money.

Probably more about the psychological impression of bitcoin becoming evermore mainstream tho
@_date: 2019-05-07 13:56:03
Right on. Odds are the "weak hands" as they say have already been flushed.
@_date: 2019-05-07 14:15:42
You are right.
Put another way, the market cap of bitcoin will be between 500 bn and 7 tn with USD as the quote currency.
We're at 100 bn now.

Sooner or later most crypto people will have a lost keys scare. If you make it through unscathed, it's good for you because you won't let it happen again.
@_date: 2019-05-07 14:08:12
Good advice. 
I kid you not, I worked at a financial services company a couple years ago and we had these lifers who somehow convinced executives that they were "blockchain" experts. They would give speeches at conferences that other d-bags attended. Anyway, they hated bitcoin, *hated it.* None of them had ever even transacted on any public blockchain ever. 
Point is, I kept telling everyone to just buy a small amount and learn how to use it.
They just sent me CNBC articles and put bullshit copies of WSJ articles on my desk (they also still received physical newspapers).
Anyway, fuck them.

Maybe ~~John Nash~~ Satoshi intended for BTC to become a reserve currency and not "money" in the sense that you're thinking of?
No population of people blah blah blah...  The entire world population ceded control of their money to a few individuals already.

I agree. It never hurts to have some extra cash around.
@_date: 2019-05-13 16:07:22
Yeah, who knows. I've been thinking this has to do with Fidelity bringing BTC to their platform. If you've ever worked in the financial industry, then you'll understand the context in which Fidelity's moves are truly balls out mindblowing.

Rick and Morty: The Blemflarck Crisis
The Blemflarck Crisis was created when Rick Sanchez managed to infiltrate the systems at a Galactic Federation Prison and changed the value of Blemflarcks to 0 in revenge against the federation for their actions in "The Rickshank Rickdemption" This collapsed the entire galactic Federation after its president committed suicide, leading all aliens to leave Earth, and life for Gromflomites on Gromflom Prime to turn into hell; with hunger crisis and almost everything destroyed, including much of the residences previously on the planet.

I think you're right. Even though exchanges profit from their TXN fees, it still can't be a good image if you're trying to operate an exchange that you expect people to trust in the future.

I know, right? They reference it like it's something we all lived through. Fuck if I know what a bunch of morons did 400 years ago betting on flowers. I did, however, live through the financial crisis and took note of the moral hazard in its remedy.

Is the thinking that running a BTC node is ok because you are only propagating transactions but LN is not ok because you have to put up some amount of coin in escrow (for lack of a better term)?
Seems like this wouldn't hold up unless .gov considered BTC to be money not a commodity.

I was told, "usually people have to work for those kinds of returns" last winter. Also, my tax guy randomly called me up this week to talk about how dangerous Bitcoin is and also that the startup I work at has an 80% chance of failure.
I lost a lot of money but at least I'm taking shots instead of sitting on the sidelines and telling people how to live.

US currency became fiat in 1971, which is why you hear the saying that U.S. dollars are backed by the “full faith and credit” of the U.S. government. Government shutdowns might affect that faith. Probably not to the extent the poster implies, but to some degree.

"works until 67"
You'll be pushed out of a corporation long before age 67. If you want to work that long, you'll either have a menial low-paying job or you'll work for yourself.
Trust me the last thing public companies want are old people on their payroll and benefits. And if you don't know that, you are an idiot.

Yes sir. Especially since crypto markets trade 24/7 and thus reduces the risk that an asset will gap up or down in between trading sessions and bypass your order, which can really burn you in other markets like futures.

Seriously. I wondered that recently, too. Probably because the masses would straight up riot if they implied that the stock market is about to take a 75% drawdown, as BTC has.
