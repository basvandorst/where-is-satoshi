No muslim was waiting for this declaration. It’s only giving green light to the law abiding citizens of deeply religious communities.

I think main issues are the following:
- high price fluctuations: Value can go 10% up or down in matter of hours. In my opinion this can be partially solved by having automated crypto to fiat and fiat to crypto converters. Where required crypto changes to meet fiat value. So that when you receive crypto (and it has to be in seconds) it will automatically convert to fiat to preserve value. The converter would have to support many fiat currencies to make crypto truly international. If you look at current situation, it is still difficult for average user to easily buy and sell crypto for reasonable price.
- Currently, we use mostly centralized exchanges.  We are at their mercy, we could lose everything any day. We need either more advanced decentralized exchanges that actually work without issues or one of those hybrid ones, where you own your keys and just use central trustable platform to exchange crypto.
- Wallets in current state are insecure. Once your device is hacked, your cryptos are gone. We need probably double authentication or some innovative solution.
Luckily, all of the above are being addressed but it could take 2 more years to go mainstream.

Cant a key-logger pick that up if your device is hacked? Thats still not proper double authentication. 
As for individuals, moving out of exchanges, you only solve the exchange problem, and maybe security problem but you don’t solve the price fluctuation problem. Not only seller of product wants to maintain the same fiat value but also the buyer should be able to convert to stable currency to avoid large losses in value.

Please, nobody was waiting for ruling by sharia law experts. Maybe only the sharia law abiding citizens and these are probably a few million people. And maybe from these millions 10% heard about bitcoin. So please cut the bullshit
The world is terribly misinformed about Muslims.

Wall street has enough cash and resources to manipulate the market. I mean look how easy is to release negative news and play on sentiment. They have the billions to make whale moves in their favor. 
As as soon as the crypto society realizes that bitcoin doesnt have to be the base coin, we will be able to move on.
We need more exchanges, decentralized ones, or even hybrid ones. We need high liquidity to be spread all around the world.
