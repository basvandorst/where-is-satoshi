Well, the obvious bullrun is over, so no. I really don't know whether to hold my Substratum or if I should convert some to Bitcoin, because Bitcoin looks like it's about to explode back to 20k any time now... Bleh.

I haven't made enough to diversify, though I would like to start doing it. I was thinking about NEO and Litecoin.

If you sell your Bitcoins for Fiat, you have to pay income tax
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:49:43
Did they already sell it? Everyone's watching for the transaction.
@_date: 2017-12-02 21:39:40
Selling crypto for fiat and paying X% of tax? No thanks!

Why cares about Bitcoins when your tax payers pay for your entire [mansion](
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:29:27
Maybe they just did it for the trolls. 5k less coins on the market.
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:29:28
Dollar cost averaging for Bitcoin means losing money, unless you're doing it during these unstable periods. But if you waited for this current unstable period, you've still lost a lot of money since it was only 10000 dollars not too long ago.
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:44:30
Implying there are non-virtual Bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-12-03 05:55:01
Yea, but you might get taxed on the product you're buying, not on the income you're making.
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:54:22
Libertarianism is a form of anarchism. While I don't disagree with tax as a whole, I do believe that some things should be taxed way less.
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:20:15
Smart. I don't have an income as a student but I made 5,5K this month alone, which is nice.
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:22:22
Is it even confirmed yet?
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:10:01
The majority of Bitcoins are lost with no way of ever getting them back lol.
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:56:53
That's why you don't move your coins that often.
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:50:53

Don't cash out ;D
@_date: 2017-12-04 08:48:15
I'm not selling shit ;) I will always keep my money in crypto. I might check out eventually, but I'll move to a tax haven first like Malta or something ;)
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:10:38
You wouldn't want that.
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:34:39
Do the Japanese still use fax?
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:43:50
I know. But if you CASH OUT on Bitcoin, or if you tell the government you have an X amount of Bitcoins, they will tax that too. Here in the Netherlands, the government wants a tax for all things you own. So if I tell the government that I have 10000 Bitcoins, they will tax the shit out of me, so I wouldn't ever tell them.

If something as simple as YouTube is illegal in China, it's not weird to think that they outlaw crypto as well.
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:56:31
I agree. I kind of like my Dutch government. I realise that it can always be better, but it's a whole lot better than most governments.
@_date: 2017-12-02 09:44:45
Most people will NOT use Bitcoin for payment at this time, but as long as the option to pay with Bitcoin exists, Bitcoin is becoming a more valid currency.
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:08:32
So you pay with paper wallets?

You can set aside some money if you want that you want to spend anyways and buy on the dip. Pro-tip: If there's a HUGE dip, don't be too generous. You might not see a huge dip any time soon, so USE THE OPPORTUNITY.
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:08:55
Let's hope they do so we can buy more!

I'm not saying they do everything right. They should probably also fix their population. 100 million people with little to no work in the future? They should really get on that.
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:56:03
It probably won't be as Bitcoin is on a more steady and healthy growth at this point.

What if you can never cash out on it in your own country? Like it or not, if you can't cash out, it'll be quite worthless (at least in your country). Luckily they can move to another country with their USB and cash out there.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:13:18
You can only withraw 10000 per day on an exchange.
There might be other options for rich people.
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:23:57
Early for some cryptos in general maybe, but we're already in the later stages of Bitcoin itself.

@_date: 2017-12-07 18:33:20
If they do this in a predictable fashion, it will only ensure that we can day trade Bitcoin and make a load of money. If hope banks do this so we know when to expect a dip :P

Yeah, seems more likely. It was a joke though ;)
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:54:32
My sister is also a panic seller. At least she sold when it was sort of "High" and still made a profit. She doesn't care if she buys fewer Bitcoins for the same money at a later date, as long as she still makes a profit (albeit not a larger profit).
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:40:12
There are more efficient currencies than Bitcoin. Most people here only bought Bitcoin because the price goes up exponentially, not because the tech behind it is superior to other cryptos. True story.
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:53:48
It's going very slow at this point. Whenever it reaches a nice price (almost $12,000 today I think), a whale dumps his entire wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:03:11
It's called realism. BTC will never reach an infinite amount of money.

Exactly, but I actually don't know if it's also a tax haven for people. I know it's a tax haven for companies, but hey... So is my country supposedly (the Netherlands). Working people pay a fuckton of taxes.
