You can do this with A LOT of stocks as well. In addition, the comparison with what is basically gambling does not make it look any better. I get though that many people buy lottery tickets... and could do MUCH better with that money!

I recommend you check out google or wikipedia now that you have internet access.

In a word: fees - if they cover costs, the network will live on. Other than that, there will hopefully be good citizens like my kids' kids that will be willing to give back even at a loss. I will have it written out in my testament :-)

It's just closer so considerably easier to reach thus as you rightly say more reasonable.

10+ % a day is a proper pump, 5+% just a regular one (edit: within a single day that is). BTW nothing to jump on, I'm with you already.
EDIT: love it, it turned into a mini (regular) pump!

That's very far from pumping with recent very low volumes ... be patient!

On the tight range, consider the descending formation that has been holding rather well: [
Regarding Bakkt: Not much will happen right upon launch - it will need to prove itself under load as volume picks up, news/word needs to spread around etc. Don't get your hopes up! Long-term this will be very beneficial  for the space as a service to institutions.

and bigger than [*insert anything really*]? What a random comparison.

How do you watch movies? Was speaking about the 1 minute chart of course lol, what else would a reasonable person look at?
edit: We got our action scene by the way, need to go back to movie now.

Everyone is trapped in his/her own chosen timeframe. Personally, I don't like to compare myself with a one day fly... or a goldfish.

Feels like watching a movie: it's super boring at this very moment - not quite enough to make me change channel though. Guess I'll just wait for the next fighting scene...
