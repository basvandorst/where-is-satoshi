good point, I provide a slight doorway into future expansion on the software design description, namely, point 5,
5. Java based open source allocation for integrating other types of computation not applicable to R for future expansion. This could be done in python rather, and I am inclined to it. In the end, this is not a concrete proposal, more of a very flexible one. If nothing else, perhaps this will give someone else an idea to better implement it.

Bitcoin could be a good enough excuse for countries to find a common ground, sequester old grudges to the past, rebound from financial disarray into the 2020s as though it were the roaring 20s of the 1900s. But the reason I'm into Bitcoin is because it gives me common ground with the hundreds of thousands of generations of the future. Whether nay-sayers like or not, the number of generations that won't know cryptocurrency as a vital part of their lives is few and growing fewer. It's kind of cool to get a glimpse of what it feels like to be in the future.

1. Yes, most well funded labs are capable of handling this type of analysis. But think about this, in 20 years, do you think those labs would have the same hardware? BitSolve takes the problem of upgrading hardware out of the equation and if the theory is right, because of free-market dynamics, should decrease, the current price of computation.
2. Next Gen sequencing, atleast the data generation part would still be handled with the hardware/software that comes with the sequencers. However, once the data is generated, downstream statistical analysis would be were BitSolve enters the arena.
3. The architecture really pushes anonymity, in addition to breaking apart the data for parralel processing by the network, it would also be impossible to trace back to a lab, because every analysis would be represented by a newly created public address to which the results will associated back to. Only the owner of the newly created public address would be able to unlock the results in its entirety, while remaining anonymous throughout the process.

A simple proposal for an amendment:
  **A Multi-Tiered Approach(AMTA)**:
  For example, let's take a 2 tiered license.
   **Tier 1**: *Virtual currency businesses w/t &lt; $X / day volume(avg)*
                
   -Businesses that fall in this category have to apply for tier 1 license(cheaper), and comply with basic KYC (e.g. photo id and address of users).
  **Tier 2**: *Virtual currency businesses w/t &gt; $X / day volume(avg)*
             
   -Businesses that fall into this category have to apply for a tier 2 license(less cheap), and comply with more rigoruous and nuanced security and policy guidelines.
By employing a multi-tiered approach, New York may still foster a healthy crypto-innovation environment by mitigating the barrier to entry for new entreprenuers(tier 1s), while controlling the risk associated to legal renegades by limiting their transactional volume.

Excellent question. This is where I need some help. Here is my preliminary proposal.
The hash for the solution is broadcasted.
The solution hash that is more prominent (i.e 51% consensus) is choosen
The rewards are then dispensed out on log function.
The first person to broadcast the consensus solution is rewarded the most (x), the second caster is rewarded lesser(x/2^1), the third even lesser (x/2^3) and so on.... 
This should eliminate the need for benchmarking. Although I'm still working on this. Any help is appreciated.

Hello GSpotAssassin(nice name btw), I have done my research, I've been working as a bioinformatician for 8 years now and understand the computational requirements for biomedical research from a grassroots, operational level. Let's take computingforgood as an exhibit A.
1) They provide extremely specialized computation, e.g. transcriptomics or protein level analysis on either an expression level (gene expression using high-throughput microarray, btw next gen sequencing is the newer tech), or protein folding. These criteria limit, drastically, the type of analyses possible. If you've worked in bioinformatics, you will realize, very quickly, that almost every type of molecular analysis involves a statistical software called, R (and Bioconductor), so we attack it from there. Propose a architecture that is truly data, lab, authority, research focus agnostic. Which then enables free market dynamics that computingforgood couldn't achieve due to their limited focus. Btw, did you notice that computingforgood arbitration and computational requests are handled by a singular untransparent node (i.e. from ripple labs via collaboration with labs they've achieved a contract with) :-) That's last century technology don't you think?

Yes. Here is why this system is better.
1) It provides monetary compensation for the people running the analysis, Folding was a voluntary program.
2) It allows anyone to request an analysis and conduct the analysis in a free market enviroment, i.e peer-2-peer rather than one lab dictating the type of analysis conducted.
3) It's not only limited to protein folding but any type of statistical analysis that can be coded in R

Hello matt608, thank you for pointing this out. Here is the reason why this has a biggerscope. CureCoin as expected, will only work on protein folding,  BitSolve would accept statistical analysis from any lab, not only those that do protein folding, so Genomics, Transcriptomics, Epigenomics, Proteomics, Metabolomics, and that's just molecular biology. Any statistical analysis that can be written in R can be sent to BitSolve. It is data agnostic.

Hello efeex,nice to see a fellow bioinformatician. I'm editing my response because I think your well thoughtout question deserve a little more thought from my part.
1) You mentioned you do not necessarily see a need for this system because your lab already has the capability unless you want to analyze 1000 of samples.
    -   You are correct, however not every lab is well equipped. This structure would allow labs to pay for hardware on an per analysis basis which would allow participants that aren't as well funded. Think about 20 years from now, your lab would need to upgrade hardware right? This system would free your lab from doing so because as people upgrade their personal computers, the network would upgrade dynamically.
2) The rapid adoption of automated workflows and analysis protocols is what makes this project possible. The difference is that you would not be limited by your hardware in the size of analysis possible. Once this system matures it would be "attached" to frequently used databases (think ones found in NCBI GEO etc) and workflows will allow some truely large scale analysis that would allow you to incorporate a diverse set of algorithms, think combination of transcriptomics with proteomics and epigenomics datasets.
3) This seems counter intuitive to me, perhaps I reading it wrong. In my understanding and experience data related to peer review publications have to be available to the public at request, when they request it. In fact, referees for a publication, when chosen, are recommended to analyze the data themselves before reaching a conclusion(I know that doesn't happen a lot, but the system is designed to accommodate that). So data availability is actually in my favor because there's so much out there.. I'm sure you know of GEO datasets  Now,of course when the data is disseminated into a public repository or even before analysis, they have to be anonymized sufficiently to protect the patients(clinical studies), that is common procedure, however, tedious, and not abiding by it would create some backlash. 
** You mentioned parrallel processing and how life scientists suck at programming. The parrallelizing of the analysis will be handled by the software. Scientists will simple copy their R code, data into the system, and bid for a price of analysis.

I like this thought process, we may have to look non-english alphabets to find something that is unique. Since the person or persons responsible for Bitcoin decided on a Japanese name for the author ("Satoshi Nakamoto"), why not consider using this = 聡  , it is a Japanese symbol that's very unique in the currency world but best of all, it literally translates to "Satoshi"
Satoshi = 聡

Hello yorrick,
                   Firstly, Supercomputers are allowed to participate in the network just like any other computer. Secondly, "relying on a bunch of disperate CPUs out in the cloud" is exactly what previous technologies have utilized specifically for protein folding[1]. This the first time, the power to request an analysis would be taken out of the hands of a few researchers and put into the hands of anyone with some btc. Protein folding is a very small part of the biomedical research, BitSolve is optimized atleast initially(because it focoses on R) for quantitative analysis of case control, which opens the spetra for not only proteomics but, genomics, transcriptomics, epigenomics, metabolomics and anything else that can be expressed in R. Hope this answers your question.

Firstly, I do not have the answer to your inquiry, at least not anything with any particular scientific significance. However, I may be able to help you with some possibilities.
Satoshi Nakamoto was in close correspondence with a few identities(real/pseudonymous) before the launch of the compiled code. Once the much anticipated code was circulated amongst the small group of cypherpunks, I can only speculate that they ran it. Note, the original client had a dropdown menu "Options-&gt;Generate Coins."  Here are some of those identities..
* **Satoshi Nakamoto**
* **Hal Finney** [1]
* **Ray Dillinger** [2]
* **James A. Donald** [3]
* **Dustin D. Trammell** [4]
On another note, folks  seem to be confident that the February 2014 spent coins were not from Satoshi Nakamoto. 
PS:- If you are wondering about the 6 day gap between the 1st and 2nd block, it is most likely because Satoshi Nakamoto mined the first one(January 3, 2009) before anyone knew the software existed. Then on  2009-01-09 20:05:49 UTC, he emailed cypherpunks mailing list about the software and how to start mining. [5] He had probably restarted the network several times before mining the first block, as he was trying several attack and viability scenarios, possibly for self assurance.

to each other and randomly dropping packets.**" -**Satoshi Nakamoto** 2008-11-14 17:29:22 UTC[6]

Think about it this way, assume we have 2 block chains , first one has 5 min block time and the second has 10. However, both have the same network hash rate behind it.
Let's say a transaction is broadcasted at 2 p.m. 
The 5 min block time chain confirms it on 2:05 p.m. 
Diminishing probability in rewriting history:
The 10 min block time chain leaves it unconfirmed for another 5 mins and is as you described it, is "less secure".
At 2:10 both achieve same cumulative hash power behind it but differing security. This is especially pertinent with RBF and transaction malleability.There's a section in the Nakamoto et. al paper where Satoshi provides the math for this. In summary, because it took $1B to mine a block doesn't mean it will take $1B to rewrite it, even if it's the tip. The attack has to spend $2B dollars, because they have to mine 2 blocks before the network mines a block on top of the block the attacker wishes to rewrite. When an attack has a fracion of the total hash power, the math punishes them a lot for trying to rewrite. Severact also talks about this below.
Another scenario, let's say the hash power has increased so much that 1 confirmation is backed by 1B Cost in hardware for a confirmation for the 10 min chain. The user still has to wait for 10 min to get that 1B security stamp, before which it is "naked", however the 5 min blockchain gives it half 500M in 5, which may be enough for a peace of mind. 
Last point, some of us believe Satoshi choose 10 min because he thought the network would take 1 min for block propagation and verification, and since he didn't want to waste more than 10% ( 1 min / X min &lt;= 0.1) of the networks hash rate, block time was set at 10 min. If this is true, the assumption may have not been accurate as the network takes a lot less time to complete said tasks. Which means 10 mins may not be as justifiable as many think.
There's also an argument to be made on behalf of 5 min block time for SPV, but I'll spare you the details unless you want it.
Hope this helps.

You've articulated your insight well. However, I have been talking about this for a while now. Competing chains with such a high overlap in owners, accounts, and legacy tech will eventually, IMO, cause problems down the line. I enunciated this when UASF was being pitched as "Independence Day," while I preferred to think of it as " first day of battle." Intense at first but by no means done because of the high potential of a hard fork and associated 0 sum game dynamics at a scale unlike anything before. If my forecast is right, resolving this problem may not result in any form of finality.
