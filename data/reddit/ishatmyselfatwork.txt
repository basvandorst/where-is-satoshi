OK I see now.  I went back into the Coinbase account and found that import function.  It wasn't too intuitive from their front end.  Thanks to everyone who answered.  This has made the whole thing a lot clearer now.  I really hope BTC catches on but this initial learning curve seems to be a big detriment, especially for stupid people like me!

I'm talking about [this post](
  
I thought I knew what is going on with BTC but then I saw this and had no idea how a person would have claimed this even with the private key printed on the back.

Well I have a blockchain wallet, a Coinbase wallet and a Changetip wallet.  All of them have puny amounts in them because I was never fully on board with the understanding of how they work.  But I am getting close and will buy some actual coins soon.

I have some teeny amounts that I got from a few faucets until I realized how ridiculous they were.  What confuses me is that post from a little while ago with the dollar and the BTC paper on the post.  It had the public on front and the private on back.  If I saw that I definitely would have taken the BTC paper but would have had no idea how to actually transfer it from that account to mine.

LOL half true.  I am on a throwaway...or what was a throwaway now.  But I am truly interested and looking to get into buying BTC.  I honestly did not expect any tips, was really only looking to learn about the private keys.
