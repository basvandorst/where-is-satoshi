How bad is the current congestion?
I decided to send BTC instead of ETH b/c of the ETH congestion. 
Coss &gt; Bittrex, 0 confirmations in 3 hours.
0.01 fee.
It'll go through, probably just take a day?

That’s a really low sat/byte. Most exchanges charge me .001 btc for my individual transaction. It looks like they charged .001 for that whole batch...
Might be a few more days but someone else can correct me if I’m wrong.

Provide the blockchain info ?
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:29:42
Yes. We have had multiple corrections in 2017 and generally 35% is as far as they go. We’re around there now.

No one knows, just hold.

Doubt it, the FOMO hasn't begun yet. Alts will bleed a bit more

Coinbase has BTC listed roughly 2k higher than BTC.
Should I move my BTC to coinbase to flip later or keep it on binance?
Would the fees be worse than the price difference?
I want to move my money back to buy alts after this bull run. (Via ltc)
Roughly .6 btc 
thanks in advance.

Lmao the FUD is getting hilarious 
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:54:51
Like you said, no one knows.
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:39:38
I’m bullish but it didn’t bother you to ask your friend to come to that conclusion?

This article says they will "cautiously review closing cryptocurrency exchanges." It doesn't make sense for the title to be "impose additional regulatory crubs" if they were really closing all virtual exchanges. That's a ban not regulation.
It's the choice of words that Reuters used that is causing this panic. IMO, it means SK will begin to close exchanges if they don't meet the justice ministry's criteria.

Won't it take an hour and some change?
My hope is to sell friday / early saturday if things bode well

Could go either way, a lot of people simply think “futures, oh no, Wall Street is going to short!” 
But every short needs a long position to match, it’s a zero sum game.  Buy at the dips and hodl

I consider myself pretty dog shit at trading about did 500% last month.
62% is not impressive in this market, sorry. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:35:26
No one knows, could rise after futures become available. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:22:27
Well the biggest hurdle was the hours leading up to the futures. How many people were going to get scared because of the "Wall St. short FUD?" 
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:30:36
It's looking good so far. Personally, I expected a deeper dip leading to the CBOE opening. 
We're past that hurdle at least. Should be an interesting monday.

Shorts ATH, had to be squeezed
