While in the midst of this correction can we please acknowledge the misuse of the word, "bitcoins".
 Like when your asked, "how will you be paying for that bagel, young chap?" We don't respond with, "bitcoins, I’ll be using bitcoins" 
 Because it simply will never cost more than one bitcoin to pay for a fucking bagel.
Bitcoin, plural. They can be divided into smaller increments bitcoin. They aren't broken into smaller "bitcoins" and magically sprinkled over a delicious bagel.

Dear Patrick Byrne,

Hey there little critter,
You're wasting your time. 
Yes, I know bitcoin can be divided into smaller increments, of bitcoin. Do you hear how that rolls off the tounge? 
Thanks for the timeline, I guess.
"Proving" someone once paid 10000 btc for pizza... in 2010. 
You're in your own world.
Let’s see that happen at our current exchange rate, with a bagel, and you'll have come close to proving some kind of point. 
Speaking of proving points, here's a step deeper into your unsolicited link.
 
The information you've provided proves there are are no "S’s" in the bitcoin unit system.
"Bitcoin is great, isn't it?"
"Just think, all the bitcoin in the World." 
Ahh that sounds nice, doesn't it? 
Now have fun spending entire "bitcoins" on pizza.
Thanks for your time,  Diarrheagiraffe.
