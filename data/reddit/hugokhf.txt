How is the transaction fee determined? Is it in terms of x% of a bitcoin transaction or a fixed fee?
@_date: 2018-01-31 20:54:46
what, collge kids with 100$ in their trading account?
@_date: 2019-07-13 14:20:07
This is actually so shit it’s kinda funny
@_date: 2018-08-09 07:12:28
1000 as of tuesday or as of wednesday?
@_date: 2018-08-04 19:52:46
it would have been a lambo if you sold earlier ;)
@_date: 2018-08-11 15:07:01
Holding USD is less risky than holding Bitcoin
@_date: 2018-08-09 07:14:06
there are ETN which you can buy for less than 300 euro per 'share'
@_date: 2018-10-15 08:00:07
That’s why bitcoin mass adoption won’t happen in the near future. It’s so susceptible to price manipulation 
@_date: 2018-10-16 18:27:09
It’s pointing out a fun fact, and you see it as anti-crypto propaganda. 
Lmao �� yall paranoid as fuck. 
@_date: 2018-11-11 13:57:55
XBTE, about €260 a share 
Well it’s a ETN to be fair. I don’t really give a shit if I own the underlying asset or not to be honest
@_date: 2018-11-04 15:36:38
All of your point is fair, but have nothing to do with dollar strength and weakness. 
Dollar strength and weakness is governed mostly by interest rate
@_date: 2018-11-11 12:59:32
There’s already bitcoin ETF 
@_date: 2018-02-04 02:43:25
But why would you want to buy it with bitcoin instead of normal dollar? 
@_date: 2018-03-18 02:32:59
It’s not. The utility of bitcoin is the same no matter if it’cost 1 or 10,000. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 22:02:42
Depending on the price of bitcoin the merchants may or may not be able to make enough to pay the rent. Sounds out right ridiculous 
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:48:08
no one is stopping you from leaving for now, and buying it back  when you feel like the drop has settled a bit
@_date: 2018-02-02 11:49:51
80-90% from ATH is a crash, not a dip. 
not to mention that going back to ATH is not a guarentee
@_date: 2018-02-02 11:14:42
it is more pathetic to hold on to your investment because 'you can't afford to lose it' and just hopes it goes up again
Losing money in investing is not pathetic, it is just a major part of it
@_date: 2018-11-16 01:18:24
How do you even see mass adoption working if it’s higher fee and slow transaction speed?
In real world, there’s always a trade off between security and convenience
@_date: 2018-03-31 18:03:42
Loads of people print email out for their meeting
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:38:31
It is sensible to limit your loss if you don't believe in the future of the asset anymore.
@_date: 2018-02-05 12:11:22
What do Buffett know? We redditor certainly knows more in bitcoin than the old slag /s
@_date: 2018-02-03 11:33:43
Too volatile to be a currency. No chance big businesses will accept that
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:50:56
it is called inflation
@_date: 2018-03-31 13:28:01
That’s some nice mental gymnastics 
@_date: 2018-02-05 12:12:03
Pulling out of his arse. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:22:07
Do this sub hold a grudge to warren Buffett or something lol
@_date: 2018-03-18 02:35:38
Chart show something in 2020? That’s the most ridiculous thing I’ve ever heard. Chart can only predict short term movement, not something in 2 years time
@_date: 2018-02-03 00:46:28
bitcoin is a financial instrument, you don't own it shit.
How can this be upvoted when that's some bullshit propaganda? 
@_date: 2018-02-02 11:52:52
their utility doesn't depend on the price at all though
@_date: 2018-02-07 09:42:46
Does this hint that crypto in general is a massive bubble? People throwing money into it without knowing what they are actually buying into
@_date: 2018-02-11 02:35:58
I mean in a currency sense, why would people spend bitcoin if they have dollars in hand? Same as people won't sell their asset for their every day transaction. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:39:19
that sound like a pyramid scheme
@_date: 2018-11-19 20:39:26
Are u that delusional lol
@_date: 2018-02-11 02:26:40
If the bitcoin value is going up and up, why would people spend the bitcoin? 
@_date: 2018-02-04 20:57:47
That is just simple algo trading which is very common in stock markets
@_date: 2018-02-06 09:20:05
Bitcoin down 60% in last 30 days: not a crash. 
Stock market down 5%: definitely a crash
@_date: 2018-02-04 11:11:04
But the value of crypto will have no effect on the utility though. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:19:03
8k wall is arbitary. That's no indicator suggest there's a wall around 8k. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:04:44
It is not a bear market(for stocks), it is just a correction
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:50:20
Would a company receive a currency where it can fluctuates 10% every day? I honestly do not see it happening, at least not till bitcoin settle in price  (no matter high or low)
@_date: 2018-02-04 21:03:27
No it is a common thing to use computer to automatically do trade for you at certain price level. 99.9% of people do it. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 02:37:27
If bitcoin can't stand FUD, it has no place at all in being a currency. Any currency and financial instruments face constant scrutiny under the media, and rightly so. If the fundamentals is strong enough, FUD will not do any harm and won't be anything more than a short term impact (if any).

Their contract with PayPal runs till 2020. PayPal will remain a payment option till then, at least
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:07:48
Finally a sensible post
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:26:21
it is not a hedge when crypto is not correlated to USD at all.
Printing money is to used to control inflation, it is not some illuminati shit. It is just economics 101
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:35:25
The fact that you don't set a 'strategy' to limit your loss is just as foolish.
@_date: 2018-02-02 11:21:32
It hard to argue that cryptocurrency is not a bubble.
Blockchain is here to stay, same cannot be said for sure for bitcoin
@_date: 2019-09-28 21:26:47
See Japan last few decades for real life example of deflation. You will be hard to find economists who think deflation is better than inflation. But hey, what do they know
@_date: 2019-09-28 21:25:37
Having no control of monetary policy is also a bad thing.
@_date: 2018-04-01 15:56:48
It’s showing 6500 because it is April fool. Can’t believe none of you figured it out yet. Once it’s 2nd April it will be back to 8000 bull run
@_date: 2018-04-01 16:07:55
No wonder why Facebook ban those ads
@_date: 2018-04-01 15:58:03
But it’s April, not February 
@_date: 2018-04-01 15:59:18
Not sure if trolling. Most people in Zimbabwe don’t even have internet access, how they gonna use bitcoin?
