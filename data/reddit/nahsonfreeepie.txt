what is the point of this post
@_date: 2013-11-23 04:59:32
Bitcoin absolutely does have utility- realistically, though,there are incentives for governments to keep individual currencies. We don't even know that bitcoin is the way to go. I personally advocate for it, i think it will be extremely viable in the long run and many of my economics professors agree. But no smart investor keeps all his eggs in one basket. Risk management is such a key issue here- especially with such a groundbreaking experiment.
tl;dr : markets operate rationally - throwing all your money into an untested, unproven resource is historically not the way to go.

why is uneven distribution of wealth a problem. Early investors saw potential early and are being compensated for taking a risk. Let them manipulate the market if they choose- the whole point of bitcoin is that it is unregulated

well let me stop you right there. 
1)Governments absolutely can, and probably will (in the mid-long run), regulate bitcoin. The current wave of optimism, which I can see beaming out of your posts, is derived mostly from governments acting cautiously. The US government wants to wait and see before it acts- it doesn't want to curb enthusiasm and/or investment derived from it (see senate hearings for more).
2) Just because it is insanely different from anything we have seen before doesn't' ensure it's immediate success. This is exactly why deep, thought provoking discussion is occurring to evaluate its long term viability. 
3) Even if it does become the go-to store of value. It's simply that. A means of transaction. Banks/ governments will simply adopt to it use that to poorly allocate resources. 
Your mistake, in my opinion, is looking at this as a black and white issue. There will always be room in the world for more than one currency, type of currency, store of value, legal tender whatever. Regardless of which is the most accepted, most importantly, it does not change the macroscopic view of economics- simply the means by which they take place.
tl;dr  Don't make wild assumptions about the future of bitcoin. It is not a black and white issue.

Its so funny that people think of Bitcoin as this counter-cultural movement when it's really just another form of storing value. There isn't a massive conspiracy or sham regarding our current monetary system- just massive inefficiencies leading to poor allocation of certain resources.
As a (passionate) economics student- our 'old school economics' doesn't stop at bitcoin. quite the opposite. Bitcoin is becoming adapted into our current system; soon enough (if it is successful) it will be just another part of a diverse investment portfolio.

Why the fuck do you care- the market will crash again. Liquidity issues continue cause volatility, and with the majority of bitcoin users having no trading expertise, there is no doubt that there will be panic sales.
Watch it tumble down. Smile as it does. Buy back during correction and don't wait for market verification.

what. the. actual. fuck.
why do people think that bitcoin is going to change life as we know it- it is and alternative form of payment- an intermediary. A store of value.

question- was this your first purchase with them? Also is your account verified?
