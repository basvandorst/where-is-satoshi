Agreed. You're not going to see much recovering until after the holidays. The only people playing right now are whales. Remember why we are all here. Yes we love the price. But we all know Bitcoin is going to take over the financial system as we know it. Only people who believe in this tech will benefit from this. Everyone else will panic sell and regret it later on in life.

"Muh Russia" is even in Bitcoin discussions now? There is no evidence that Wikileaks has worked with Russia. There is evidence that Wikileaks has leaked Russian documents, however.
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:45:23
But it isn't. Evidence has a definition. All of the shit you linked is speculative at best. For example, you even lied about RNC material. He did not release it because according to him, it was already publicly on the internet. But it doesn't fucking matter because you do not have any defining proof. 
And I was not making the claim, so the burden of proof is on you. I can easily and rightfully say that your evidence is not sufficient if I am not making the claim. I can still be wrong that he is NOT a puppet, but I'm certain I am right that your 'evidence' is not sufficient enough to come to such a conclusion about a ridiculous conspiracy theory.

@_date: 2017-12-22 18:07:17


I can see why you're upset. 9/10 people who are ok with Bitcoin's price going down are people who are sour grapes they didn't get it cheaper. So they turn to a shitcoin like Bcash that they can buy more of for less. It makes them feel better thinking that, "Oh no, while I might have missed Bitcoin, it looks as if the REAL opportunity started the moment I discovered crypto!"
Good luck. I personally think Bcash is ok, I would never own any. I just think it's retarded to want the model in which everything goes by to crash. Only an idiot would think that was good. Hence the overall crash on all cryptos right now because of Bitcoins price falling. This is what you get when Bitcoin fails. This project is fucking useless if Bitcoin can be overtaken so easily by a coin that started in fucking August. Anyone who can't see that is a fool.

Not sure what that has to do with military and police. I myself am a combat veteran and spent 5 years in the Infantry. You're calling me a traitor because I don't buy for a second this idea that a huge conspiracy to take over the U.S government involved a dude living in an embassy that had previously exposed war crimes that the Democratic party was jacking themselves off over.
And no, I don't trust my country. Are we not on fucking r/bitcoin right now? I mean you do realize what this is, right? Bitcoin exists BECAUSE of a complete lack of trust in government and third parties regulated by that government.

You always have a chance to gain money. It all depends on what you put in it. I help a lot of people I know get in to bitcoin. Almost all of them did the same thing. 


And that's perfectly fine. But at the same time if you're expecting any real gains from that, it's a long shot. It'll be a nice little present to open later on down the line.
I would just set aside an amount per week. If bitcoin is an an ATH or going up, just put the money aside and wait. Even if you have to wait a full week. It will pay off with patients and buying at the right time.
Or the other option is to do what I said above but buy at any time. This will still work for long term, but you'll likely get less bitcoin for the same amount of USD unless you just always get lucky and your pay-in day always falls on a down day for bitcoin.

It's perfectly normal to get a new address every time you do a tx with it for security purposes. There can be multiple addresses in a wallet. As many as you'd like, actually.

I watched a clip, maybe someone could find it. It was CNN or MSNBC, one of them. This guy was on there talking about how dangerous bitcoin was and how he even heard someone tell him that their yoga instructor or some shit told them to buy bitcoin and that "if it crashed" don't worry just buy the dip. He was really disturbed by this kind of trading advice. But I was fucking dying laughing at the idea of people now going around repeating all the shit they heard. Now everyone is going around saying hodl, buy the dip. What a fucking timeline.
So you can definitely give them that advice. Just say hodl, it's not even a real word so you're good. (it is)
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:02:13
Ok one thing to learn about the crypto community is that better tech doesn't mean shit. Not to mention these other coins with 'better tech' are not even close to pushing the limits like bitcoin is 24/7. Also, adoption != more value. Plus, no one cares about TX times. 
Yeah, litecoin is faster and cheaper tx fees. Still 90 dollars. People want bitcoin, and it likely won't change. I too was an ETH guy, and I made a lot of money only to realize I was in the wrong fucking coin. The moment I switched to BTC, I made a lot more money than I ever did with ETH. 
Yes it could crash and burn, but it's nothing I have no heard before. These same arguments can be taken back to any point in bitcoins history. Yet here we are, 10.5k.

Do you honestly think our government doesn't do fucked up shit? Just because I served doesn't mean I can't criticize and be for transparency. I'm still failing to see the connection. "The government doesn't like him so you shouldn't either." is the most insane thing I've seen.
Would you sell all your bitcoins if tomorrow they said Satoshi was a terrorist? What if Satoshi is a Russian who has ties to the Kremlin? I don't expect you to answer that because I know the answer. You would likely say, "Well they only hate Satoshi because he got in the way of muh FED." Which is literally what the U.S government has done to every opponent, including people like MLK.
You are literally on a subreddit dedicated to a protocol that completely undermines the government because of a lack of trust for third parties and government officials/the FED. A lot of us are here for price, and a lot of us are here because we believe in the technology. Some of us are even here, like myself, because we love cryptography and what it can do for the world and cyber security. But we generally all agree that we want to control our own money independent from government.
Yet you want me to believe some fucking story that has yet to be proven that comes straight from said governments mouth. And at the same time accusing me of treason which is punishable by fucking death. I mean if you're here for the price, then cool. Just remember that by participating in bitcoin, you're completely going against the government.
It already happens now. A lot of politicians have said Bitcoin was used specifically for crime. Well there you go, the government has spoken. Time to sell all your bitcoin and be a good patriot :)
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:27:47
Not only that, but you have to be a fucking RETARD to not understand that if this can be done to bitcoin this way, then NO coin will ever be safe and this project is fucked. It will all come down because all it takes is a bunch of rich people to decide they want to control it.
If you support Bcash you are not here for this project. You're here because you missed the train on bitcoin and now that you got a cheaper coin to get into and you own some, you want to reset the whole god damn thing at any costs. Literally people are cheering about the insider trading shit. Not knowing that they are ultimately the victims in all of this.
Bcash is a huge threat not because of competition, but because of purposeful sabotage, lies, and idiots.

Why would you want to invest at all then? If you think 10k is too high, then I'm assuming you think it's what, 1k? 2k? Less than that?
So then you'll never make money then I guess. I mean if 10k is 'too much' then you'll never make shit right? The volatility is what makes money in bitcoin. Other than that, why not just play the stock market? You just need a minimum of $50,000 to get started, no big deal!
Anyways, I think this pretty much sums up exactly what I said. You probably have been thinking about getting in for a while. You didn't listen when you could have gotten it cheap and now that's it is expensive, you want to help create FUD along with the other salty no-coiners. You want the price to tank so you can buy some at a cheaper price.

I always tell people to ask the nay-sayers if they know anything about bitcoin. If they don't, then how could they possibly know it was bad or good?

Hiding my savings from my ex-wife. Before the divorce started, she claimed she would be able to get a hold of my savings and that she'd 'clean me out'. This was when Bitcoin was still considered on the same level as Neo Pets Points to most people.
So through a friend of mine who mined bitcoin, I decided to buy some directly from him. (He also sold 5,000 bitcoin for a new video card to mine more back in the day KEK)
She found out about it and during mediation exclaimed she wanted half. The mediator was just like, "What the fuck is this ....bitcorn?" so I told him it was like internet points. The mediator looked at me like I was a fucking moron. Like, "Why did you spend your savings on fucking internet points?" No one took her seriously.
Now don't think I'm rich, I'm not. I have managed to HODL this whole time. I'm happy enough with what I got. The best part is that she totally knows I still have it, and it's too far past the divorce to ever challenge it at this point.
It was my only option. I didn't even believe in bitcoin since this was shortly after the crash. But it was better than giving that cheating cunt my money.

Every time you receive coins on a ledger and some other wallets, the wallet address changes. Don't even worry about it.

I guess some of those mean the same thing. But you get what I mean.
@_date: 2017-11-27 04:06:18
I suggest everyone do this by sending at least 5 dollars worth. Just to test out the wallet. Then delete the wallet and restore. Would be a shame to think you wrote down all the words correctly and come to find out when you need it, it's incorrect.

Like a user said in here. A wallet can have multiple receiving addresses. There is almost no reason to send it to the same one, as each one doesn't any significance. Relax, you shit is all fine. Once you get into the habit of moving coin around, you'll understand it's no biggie.
@_date: 2017-11-21 21:58:32
One of these isn't even bitcoin's fault. It's paypals shitty system of being able to say you never meant to buy shit.

I had a friend specifically say, "Bitcoin will NEVER hit 10k dude lol what a joke"
So on FB I post updates for all the normies. I've gotten dozens of people excited about bitcoin, and I've been in the game for a long time. I posted the price at 9.7k along with his quote. 
He bent the knee and bought some bitcoin a week earlier. Edit: And didn't tell me because he knew I was right :)

Now look at it. You essentially can't live without it, and I'm not old at all. This has all happened in most reddit users' lifetime. Or shit, look at cellphones. Again, one day no one gave a fuck. The next, if you didn't have a razor you were a fucking chump at school.

I speak from personal experience here actually. The entire reason I got into Bitcoin in 2014 was so that I could avoid giving my cheating ex-wife any of my savings. So I dumped it into this, at the time, non-important internet funny money. I bought locally from my friend who has survived the Mt Gox shit.
I only HODled because I actually had no idea what I had. I mean I didn't buy thousands of them but it was 2014 afterall. Getting a divorce could have ruined it all had I not had a crypto friend who told me she couldn't keep track of it. I ended up winning overall in the divorce but the point was that even in 2014 hoes was after our magic internet money.
Keep the hoes away, or at least don't tell them about Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 21:02:21
It's amazing they don't figure it out after 15 minutes. When everyone thinks they have the winner, you know it's bullshit. Just like religion.

What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I’ll have you know I bought bitcoin over 12 years ago, and I’ve been involved in numerous cryptocurrency projects, and I have over 300 different tokens. I am a pro at HODLing and I’m the top poster on the bitcoin forums. You are nothing to me but just another shitcoiner. I will buy the dips the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am buy the dip so you better prepare for the parabolic move up, maggot. The parabolic move that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your portfolio. You’re fucking broke, kid. I can buy any token, anytime, and I can hold bags in over seven hundred shitcoins, and that’s just with my poloniex wallets. Not only am I extensively rich from HODLing, but I have access to the latest information from Prabolic Trav before it even hits youtube and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable shitcoin wallet off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon your portfolio, maybe you would have held your fucking bitcoin. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over this market and you will drown in it. You’re fucking broke, kiddo.
