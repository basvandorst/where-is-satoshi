It seems that the price manipulators have set $6k as the lower end of their dump, but their pumping isn't that high anymore (it used to go to around $9k before dropping back down to $6k and now it craps out at around $7500) so who knows...they might lower their dump to keep things more random.

And if you think there is any more to the value of Bitcoin than what price manipulators or other gamblers speculate on it then I will say the same to you.  You might want to read the Great Beanie Baby Bubble if you get the chance. If you are so convicted in your beliefs then it shouldn't bother you to read it.

Again that could be said for any gambler. If the lottery ticket winner would have kept his money in his pocket, he wouldn't have won; therefore, you should invest in lottery tickets. To the moon! Lottery has great tech.

It's obvious that the price manipulators have set $6000 as the lower limit during the recent pump and dumps.

Just a classic pump and dump. Just a few weeks ago, bitcoin was approaching the 5000's and then magically for no reason it started getting pumped up more and more to above 8000.

Oh please do some research if you're not old enough to remember how things were.  In the 80's even many normal everyday people had computers in their home whether it was a Commodore 64, Apple II, IBM PC or IBM clone, or some other lesser known thing like a TI 99.  
In the early 90's   many more people had some sort of DOS machine with Windows 3.0 running and once Windows 3.1 came out, it became absolutely mainstream for any household who could afford $1200. I remember in 1992 we got a 386 SX2/20mhz IBM PS/1 from Sam's for $800.

I'm just finding it weird that you're implying that the only way you could have bought a $3500 car was through gambling on bitcoin.  You could have easily won the money in vegas or a lotto ticket and it would have made just as much sense to say "people told me I was wasting my money but who's laughing now?"  Those same people who didn't gamble their money also own cars. 
In other words, you gambled and you got lucky. Don't pat yourself too much on the back.

Well since you know my family history. Playing with an old TI computer to code BASIC and finding software in garage sales and flea markets really made me a moneybag in 1988.  I remember taking my limo to the public library to sign up for an hour of computer time on a PC until we could finally get one in the 90's.  And my friends?

If I may sound like an old fart for a moment, this is what pains me about kids today and their computing experience. Sure they have in their pockets a computer far more powerful than what we had as a desktop but many of them have no idea of even the basics of what's going on inside and even if they did, they can't really modify things as manufactures keep sealing them.  My current Dell laptop is completely sealed up so if I ever need to change a battery on that thing even, I'll have to google the hell out of it.  
But yeah, I learned so much back then! For instance, The [IBM PS/1 Model 2121 G42]( we got from Sam's had a slow ass 2400 baud modem which was enough for me to get on BBSes but we decided to get a 14.4k modem for it and had no idea where it went...nothing inside looked like the modem's connectors.  It turned out, the damn thing wasn't an ISA architecture like every other PC, but Microchannel bus - essentially the Betamax of computer buses where it was technically better, but nobody used it.   
After that, every other desktop I ever got except for one HP (huge mistake) was home assembled from junk parts initially and later the best parts I could afford. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 14:59:31
I saw the same thing during the .com boom/bust.  People were letting common sense go out the window investing in companies that they had absolutely no product but they had a friend of a friend's cousin who made 300% in one day and all of a sudden everybody was a technology and stock market expert.  It's part of life I guess, but sometimes it's better to learn from other people's mistakes.

I'm old enough to see bubbles and fads come and go so I was one of the "stupid" people who didn't get how great bitcoin was and how it was going to change the world.   I made one simple remark about whether it could be used to to buy milk at the store and was down-voted to an oblivion and given link after link of pizza places across the country that accepted bitcoin (who possibly also sold milk). 
At the moment, my money is happily making .0005% interest at hte bank of whatever, but at least it's still there.

Because ultimately, Tesla was right about AC distribution vs. DC.  Everything you use today is because of what Tesla's work.  Edison was also kind of a jerk in general most notably for stiffing Tesla out of money and treating him like dirt because he wasn't from the US.  
I don't think one legacy has to be put down to build up the other's but if they are going to be compared head to head, I think Tesla's contribution did much more for the progress of technology.

I think if bitcoin is going to fulfill the promise of being a currency (as opposed to people just putting their mortgage in it hoping to get rich), the price has to come down to much less than $3k.   It's still in a bubble.

I'm not an EE so maybe you are and know something that I don't know but converting voltages in AC is still far easier than in DC. 
 With AC, if you wrap  an iron core with 10 wraps of wire connected to the source and 20 wraps of wire connected to the output, you'll  magically doubles the voltage. The reverse halves it.  You can pretty much get any voltage you want and need relatively cheaply and efficiently.   
You need long distance transmission? No problem, get the ratio right and you'll get 155,000 to 765,000 volts.  You have an office building that needs 480 volts? No problem, put in a transformer at the pole that converts the city line from 10,000 volts down to 480 and in the office you have another transformer that converts 480 to 120 volts for the outlets and keeps the 277/480volt for the lights. 
This is so simple, everything else looks difficult in comparison. 
@_date: 2018-06-29 13:00:31
Well before anything, the volatility has to stop and that won't happen if people look at it as an investment rather than currency.  Historically, that was when the price was less than a thousand but even then it was still pretty volatile so I don't have any conclusive data one way or another and neither does anybody else. They have lots of pretty meaningless graphs though so at the end it comes out to a gut feeling for me.  People like to trust their earnings with something that's familiar and easy to deal with and fractions of bitcoins doesn't do it. 
@_date: 2018-06-16 15:15:05


It's absolutely relevant to call out Edison for being wrong about which system was best. AC was the only practical way to spread power. The elephant killing is just a small part of that.

Lol "30%"
@_date: 2018-06-16 15:24:39
We're talking about distribution of power - not final usage. AC voltage can easily be stepped up to very high voltages and transmitted at long distances  through transmission lines so you don't need to have a generating station in every block the way you would with DC.

That is pretty easy. Just says to use a communications program (like Procomm Plus, Qmodem, etc.) to dialup to their service and send your message. It was common knowledge for anybody who used email at the time using a BBS or any online service.

And where are DVDs today?
@_date: 2018-03-30 18:37:13
I knew a guy who used to sell VHS tapes at a flea market which catered mostly to a particular ethnicity every weekend. He had used movies and such but a lot of the tapes were music videos of popular singers, sports, and things that was hard to find at blockbuster. He started by just having a single table but after a couple of years, had two whole spaces, TV's setup with the music videos playing, etc. and was doing pretty well.  
Business started going down enough to where it wasn't really worth his while to spend his weekends there. DVDs were becoming popular, broadband was starting to be available, and so he got a storage unit and packed his things in there.  
A couple of other guys who sold videos offered to buy his tapes but he thought he was getting low-balled.  These were hard to find tapes after all. He had spent a lot of time finding suppliers and catalogs.  It was just a matter of time before they would become classics.  
A couple of years later, that didn't happen.  He was still paying to keep them in storage, and even then he had a chance to just sell them at a loss and move on, but he refused because he was already so invested and he'd feel stupid if he just gave up now. 
I don't know how long he had them in storage but eventually he got them out and kind of kept them in the warehouse of a shop he owned while they baked in the heat and humidity of the summer and damp winters.  He finally accepted it was stupid to keep it and put them all in a dumpster last year. 
If he could have a do-over, I bet he would have sold the damn things while he could break even or lose 20%.

"You just don't understand bitcoin" is all I've heard from people defending bitcoin's failures. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 14:07:13
Oh please. You know full well that before the get rich quick "investors" came along, bitcoin was just a happy geek play thing that had potential to be useful.  I actually was rooting for it but mass adoption never happened (failure) other than as a novelty and once the value started going up, very few if any people were actually using it as a currency but rather as an "investment" which was also a failure unless you don't mind your investment dropping down 450%.
If once the bubble is completely burst and the price is stable at the pre-bubble prices AND consumers actually use it as a currency and not as a novelty to say they bought a pizza in random shop in Hong Kong with bitcoin, then you could claim it has done its purpose.
@_date: 2018-03-30 20:34:34

I just enjoy the human condition and the get rich quick mentality which leads so many people into thinking they are too clever to work for it.   I was  around for the great Beanie Baby bubble and the dot com bubble and it just seems like these kinds of things attract the same types of people and any  criticism is met with insults of "you just don't get it".  I'm not a sociologist but there's gotta be a lot more into why some people fall for these things while others see it for what it is.  Part of it is group thought  - like when a guy on here was so proud of himself for starting a college fund for his kid by buying bitcoin (I think it was around $7k back then) and the few people who were telling him not to were drowned out by the people cheering him on and telling him he was a good father.  The other part is just greed.  
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:33:54
You're using circular logic. I'm here mostly to study the human condition and to see the reaction of all the experts.  Having lived through the dot com bubble, I used to meet a lot of "experts" then too. "You don't get it man, it's a new economy...old rules of supply and demand don't apply!"

@_date: 2018-03-28 03:59:13
It's a perfectly valid comparison if you take off the rose colored Bitcoin glasses.  Do you actually think the majority of the people buying bitcoin are doing it to "change the world"? Really? Most people buy it because they feel that it's scarce and it will go up in value.  What are they basing that on? Because in the last couple of years, it went up in value.  
The only real difference it has made in the world is to waste energy and resources. At least with beanie babies, you'd still be left with a crappy toy when it all comes down. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:30:17

@_date: 2018-02-08 04:53:12
Bought at 700 and sold at around 20,000 
@_date: 2018-03-28 04:04:53


Is that why YOU are buying bitcoin? To use it to exchange it for goods? Or is it because you think it'll gain in value and magically make you money while you say slogans like "to the moon!"?  Come on, be honest with yourself.
And no, the Beanie Baby thing was absolute madness.  People really were losing their minds over it.  I was around for that and all logic was thrown out the door.  People would compare it to the Holland Tulip Mania but they'd also get shut down and be told that this was real. I'm sure anything rare goes up in value but a few times in history, people have just gone mad and it takes it to a new level.  
@_date: 2018-02-28 14:20:36
Well a lot of companies did make it out of the 90's and are giants now  so I agree, but the difference is that the tech companies that survived had actual products and services so while there were many people who were investing blindly and joining the hype, for someone doing due diligence, they had actual data and were making an educated guess - wrong or right. 
I really don't see that being the case with Crypto.  I thought it was a nice idea at first to use it to buy goods without going through traditional banks but the vast majority of people who are buying couldn't give two shits about the ability to use their crypto to buy lunch and it's all with the belief that the value will shoot up.  Not only is there no product here, you have people spending millions of dollars buying up gear and using energy to manufacture not a tangible product or service like with tech, but mine more imaginary money again not to use, but to hold on to.  
I really don't see this ending up well for many people except whoever has vast amounts of the imaginary money and jumps out at the perfect time.  There is no logic behind it.
@_date: 2018-02-28 00:25:05

Quite the opposite actually I called them out on it then too but I wish I did invest in amazon when they first came on the scene but an "everything store" sounded weird.  
In the grand scheme of things, everything we do is a gamble - like driving to work, but that's not what I'm talking about.  
If I put my money on a coffee shop, I know something about it.  I know what the traffic in that area is, what my own motivation is, what exactly I will be selling etc.  If I invest in google, I kind of know what their track record is, their products,users, what I personally think of their products and services, etc.   Yes, there is risk but I can look at the data and make the decision to see whether it's worth the risk.  
With crypto, there is no data other than what the past value and trading was.  I know you like to think there is and people who make the real money off this (ie. the middlemen) will show you fancy graphs, etc. but there is nothing in the data that gives you any idea whether the money you put in will actually gain in value or not, because YOU and your speculation are the product. 
It used to be people bought bitcoin to actually use for purchases or as a novelty but now most people are buying it strictly with the belief that it will go up in value and no other reason.  That is a house of cards if history is any indication.
Anyway, it's your money so I'm not going to tell you what to do but I gave my opinion and you asked me to explain so here I am. If you feel secure in your "investment", read [The Great Beanie Baby Bubble](  It's a great book. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 21:16:41

You can do all the word/logic gymnastics you want but it just seems like you're enamored with the tech and it's clouding your judgement of where this bubble is heading.  A bubble is a bubble whether it's got beautiful algorithms and block chains, it's a push toy, it's tulips, or a failing cupcake shop.  People who are financially and emotionally invested them will try to justify it anyway they can.  I just threw in my two cents so you can take it or leave it.  It's your money.

I still get a chuckle when people call it "investing" instead of "gambling".  An investment is based on something - either a company's potential or the economy so you go in with some educated guess - right or wrong.  This is purely uneducated speculation. Most people buy crypto not to use but just for the value to go up.  
@_date: 2018-07-14 12:12:42
Honestly, even when I took a graduate investments class and had to sit through all the Beta calculations and diversification and all that, there was still a feeling that most of it was bullshit considering all it would take for it all to go to hell was a change in consumer trends like the iphone coming out, low carb diets catching on, online retail gaining momentum, or someone invading another country (I took the class a while back lol).   And that was with many decades' worth of study and data.  
With crypto, it's laughable when people post fancy graphs and make predictions like this is anything more than gambling.
