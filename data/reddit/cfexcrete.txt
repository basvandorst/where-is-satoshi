Nothing inherently valuable about bitcoin compared to other cryptocurrencies other than the fact that it's the first and most famous one. Of course the tech is going to improve. But just why would we be using any of the coins on the market today? They may pave the way for the future like the telegram paved the way for the Internet, and even that isn't a given.

Bad cop out when you consider that Facebook and Google had many failed predecessors and that people very much bought into the hype in the 90s. 
Not every innovation is destinied to be a hit. In more recent years it's a big problem that people are investing in every new-age invention on the off-chance it explodes when none of them ever do. Bitcoin has plenty of merit, perfectly fine that you gambled on it, but don't expect Bitcoin itself to be the next gen currency. It's been on the market for 10 years. No matter how stupid or stuck in their ways you think financial giants are they should have found a way to exploit Bitcoin by now if it is destined for such wild success

People will work wherever the money is. But no matter how much you try to improve a hot air balloon  it will never be as good at flying as a jet plane. It's a great innovation but it'll never be mainstream like you say it will be. You haven't addressed the fundamental problems with Bitcoin brought up by thread OP. You can't dismiss them by saying "tech will improve" and "A-team" is working on it and call it winning the argument.
