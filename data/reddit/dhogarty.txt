I don't think BitPay is particularly expensive, and they're one of the better companies out there, but their service is still subpar. They don't have very good dispute resolution processes, no real defined refunding process, and often new roll-outs of payment integration are poorly integrated (e.g. TigerDirect was a massive CF).
BitStamp and other exchanges charge a percentage fee, which really adds up at higher transaction sizes, and we have to do international wire to get to them. 
CoinBase gets both the spread + their one percent on each purchase.
I'm a huge fan and user of bitcoin. I probably do &gt; 10k $ of bitcoin purchases per year, but I'm under no rosy delusions about the state of things.

Definitely something that implements the idea of "economy separated from government" better, both in terms of underlying tech and in terms of adoption.
I'm very sold on that idea, and I think bitcoin is awesome as the vanguard, but it's quite conceivable to me bitcoin could be replaced by something else in the future. For right now though, I still think it's the best of the available options. Perhaps if I understood ripple better I might consider it, but it seems like it's trying to be a few too many things at the moment.

Definitely true, going to get this set up at the office for lunches, one person will pay via credit card and the rest to him with btc. However, this is not a pure win over things like Dwolla or Paypal, but the expectation of some kind of positive time value for BTC makes it an interesting gamble.
@_date: 2012-12-17 18:52:14
Fully agree with this post. I think some of us (myself included) believe that BTC has reached the simmering critical mass necessary to have a shot at becoming mainstream, but right now it has good fundamentals and a really rough interface. When you factor in learning time and effort, everything is immediately more expensive in bitcoin. 
The ONLY reason the average person should be interested in bitcoin at this point is based on someone they know convincing them of its potential for future value. 
Once little networks of people start to use it, e.g. Bitcoin Kiez in Berlin, there will be additional utility in the social value of 'hey, lets do this new thing together'.
If we're honest, we realize that there's probably only 50 bitcoiners per major city worldwide, and that's a generous estimate. Given that bitcoins are only valuable for trading with those people, you immediately restrict the liquid purchasing power of your money when you trade it into bitcoins. Granted, you may thereby gain greater, illiquid purchasing power, but its important for us to have a clear perspective on exactly what we're suggesting to people.
I think at this stage in bitcoin, we want people who are willing to accept it for what it IS and what it could become, not people who were sold on an as-yet-unrealized bill of goods who will become rapidly disillusioned.
@_date: 2012-12-14 18:12:08

@_date: 2012-12-30 21:41:41
OP: I think the crux of the issue is that loans will be economically disincentivized during a growing adoption or growing productivity phase of the bitcoin economy. It is true that bitcoins go against mainstream economic theory by having a fixed rather than an inflating supply. It is also true that, all other things being equal, a deflating currency causes less wealth transfer than an inflating currency.
However, not all transfers of wealth cause a net gain in productivity. For example, money poured into Enron stock based on false expectations of their business state. 
Having a deflating currency increases the burden of proof necessary for an investment to be considered viable. Additionally it encourages individual entrepreneurship, rather than, 'here take my money and make me more money, I don't need the details' investment simply to avoid the inflationary effects of the money supply.
Deflationary currencies cause less wealth transfer in the same unit of time, but the wealth transfer that occurs should retain its value more stably.

Trade volume alone gives greater velocity than 1, I think its currently at ~ 1.6 velocity just on the exchanges. In fairness, a lot of the real commerce DOES hit the exchanges, via bitpay or coinbase, so &lt;= 3 is probably fair.

All world reserve currencies are inherently unfair. That doesn't mean they shouldn't exist.

The subject of IP protection and the correct bounds of government regulation and enforcement in general has not been added to by your oblique reference to 'government fiat' somehow propping up the commerce of information.

This is the advice I'd recommend. Alternatively you could try CoinBase's wallet, which would allow you to sell for $ when you have downtime. Your three main options are:
* Bitcoin wallet (link above)
    * no external dependencies, talks directly to the network, you need to do your own backups, moving to and from $USD will require you to send to an exchange or to CoinBase
* CoinBase
    * they hold your wallet info, so if they get hacked you're SOL, but easy to buy and sell coins for $.
* Blockchain.info wallet
    * they hold an encrypted version of your wallet. Setting up auto email backups can make backups easier, but the potential for people to brute force your wallet offline makes this only good for storing comparatively small amounts of money (e.g. 7-Eleven cash drawer amounts)
All should work and do what you want.

You're using a false dichotomy between debt-based and innate value. The difference between a debt money and a "commodity" money is that debt money is created in the form of a loan to a specific entity. In commodity money it's created through some other means. Both rely on the faith of trading participants to hold value.
You also are arguing strangely that because money started out as debt records, at least in recorded history, all money is debt records. That's like saying all governments are primitive monarchies and all religions are fertility-based pantheism. Absurd on the face of it.

The majority of economic activity for bitcoins goes through egifter and gyft right now, mediated by bitpay. If you aggregate coinbase and bitpay merchant info, that should give you the majority of your price information. The CPI is really just the dollar CPI proxied through the available items for purchase (Target, Amazon, CVS, restaurants/delivery).
I think to assess good or bad, you need to not only look at the CPI, which establishes the deflationary trend, you also need to look at monetary velocity.

Interesting to note that 8 times as many barrels of oil get produced in a day as there are bitcoins currently. 4 times as many barrels of oil get produced per day per bitcoin there ever will be.

arbitrary collision, which is the main thing you want a hash function to be resistant against, becomes probable after the square root of the cardinality of the range of the function, i.e. after 2^128 hashes in the case of SHA256. So, your analysis is basically correct except you need to substitute 2^(128-72) = 2^56 for the 2^184 you quote.
If we had 1 Petahash/s (where we're getting close to) for the entire 4.5 years of bitcoin history, we'd have 2^77 hashes already completed. An architectural jump, e.g. cpu-gpu (2^17 ), or gpu-asic (2^7 and counting) can provide multipliers that would begin to get us close to having a collision for sha256 if we ran them for long enough. That's a ways off, and we could change the hash function if it became necessary.

OP, if you want to make some kind of social commentary, make an effort to understand the society you're in and the meaning of the words it uses. Inflation, unmodified, in today's language means price inflation, which is certainly not undergoing an increase linearly correlated with the chart you show. In the future we may experience price inflation, but if you want to argue about that you need to make cogent arguments about who will cause price inflation and how it will be caused. The monetary base you picture is certainly not the most relevant one for prices.

Deflation and inflation do affect the flow of capital, but as part of a continuum. A deflationary baseline forces the flow of capital into more conservative investments, an inflationary baseline less conservative. Market sentiment additionally affects the flow of capital in a way not strictly connected to inflation/deflation, as the capital markets are only connected to the CPI through a laggy mechanism.
Additionally, volatility of an asset increases the flow of capital in a way analogous to the inflation effect, because the possessors of capital have incentive to lock some of their capital into more stable vehicles.
I suggest that you re-evaluate your 'deflation=bad' assessment, and if you want to discuss further, we should discuss the historical foundations of that belief in detail.

USD is designed to be price constant, the whole mechanism of central bank interest rates and now QE is designed to achieve this effect. We would be stupid not to price things in dollars to take advantage of this mechanism. The inelastic supply of bitcoin makes it good for retaining value (and gaining value during increased adoption), but not good for pricing while there's still adoption left. Why would we not price things in dollars but transact for them in Bitcoin? It doesn't mean that Bitcoin is not real or useful, it just means that its not useful as a constant measure of value at this point in its development.

I think you ignore that use value in exchange is EXACTLY what makes money money. Your argument that if people are using bitcoin only because they expect to be able to trade it away they are being Greater Fool speculators creates a negative sounding name for the exact use case of money.

most of the notion that bitcoins are good for money laundering is due to clueless reporters who don't have any idea how its actually used. I have yet to see any evidence of bitcoins being used for money laundering. Its hard enough to move cash into and out of it, and the points where you can are fairly few and easy to monitor.

You need to clarify: are you wanting to take bitcoin and convert it to USD for your companies expenses, or are you taking bitcoin and converting it to USD for your customers. If the first, you don't need to register with FINCEN or get a MTL, if the second, you do.

Your understanding of the marketplace doesn't stand up to trivial math. The trading part of the market is so large that it dwarfs any effect of newly mined coins. Today for example an amount of coins equal to 60 days worth of mining was traded. In such an environment, miners selling because they need to doesn't have any significant effect on the price.

If you're asking as a libertarian, than the reason is simple: un-exercised liberties are already lost. 
If you're asking as a businessman, than the reason is more complex: often you can gain the business of a motivated minority and exposure to even non-bitcoin users via the news media that surrounds bitcoin. You can do so while isolating yourself against legal risk and currency risk by using something like Bitpay or Coinbase and only keeping a loseable   amount of profit in Bitcoin. It's not always the right decision for businesses to accept Bitcoin at this point, but for some it  can definitely be a win.
Don't silence your voice because of what the government might do, certainly not in a country that claims to like free speech and the rule of law. Force people to reckon with the difference between the claim and the reality.

Coinbase operates a lot like paypal, where you give them your account number and routing number and they bank draft into and out of your account. There is a delay in receiving your coins, and there's a chance that your first several purchases will be denied due to their sometimes false-positive fraud prevention software. After you've used them for awhile, you can get fully verified and then have coins immediately available.

I would say liquidity is the real key. I typically keep assets in both USD and bitcoin and whenever I purchase something for bitcoin I buy a similar amount from coinbase, regardless of price. When coinbase runs out of money on the exchanges, and don't allow you to lock in the price, then I'm significantly less willing to spend.

Not true at all. Right now our inflation is lower than we want it to be. That is because the perceived risk of treasuries is lower than the perceived risk of other investments. If the monetary instrument provides a baseline return rather than a baseline loss, the necessity to invest does not exist. Those investments that are pursued must have a risk-adjusted return greater than the baseline, thus they must be more conservative.

Why not just sell part of your stash, rather than all? That way you hedge against both moves, at the loss of some potential reward.

Was it too late to buy AAPL here? 
An appreciating asset spends more time making new highs than a neutral asset. Try to assess the real potential value, assess the risk, and decide whether its worth it to you to put money in. If the market is overvalued right now, just wait and you'll be able to buy back in, so its not too late. If you believe the market will just keep going up, then you should buy even though you won't make as much as if you had bought earlier. Either way, its only too late if bitcoin becomes worth less from this point forward.

This happened after the July 2011 bubble. It really wasn't the huge problem you believe it to be, though I agree bitcoin would be a little bit better with a smoother difficulty adjusting function.

I feel like you're arguing from a position of ignorance here. We already have the Exante fund having shares equal one bitcoin, and they and others have been operating in the bitcoin markets for a while. As long as the trades are reflected in the real market, it hardly matters.

because I bought the bitcoin ahead of time expecting deflation, waited for some of it, and then purchased the computer. I effectively pay myself the difference. Additionally, I have consumer protection because I purchased on amazon, I actually bought a $1000 amazon gift card.
There's also some philosophical motivation: I like prepay-oriented economy more than postpay.

Three additional architectural/adoption jumps would get us into a vulnerable area ( (2^17 )^3 = 2^51 ). Now, we don't have any clear roadmap for what those jumps would be, unlike the cpu/gpu jump and the gpu/asic jump, so they may never happen.
The relationship between asic miners and collision finding is a little bit more subtle than you suggest (i.e. you can use them to find collisions, but only on the subset of the range beginning with 00 00 00 00, making the collision about 2^32 times harder to find), but I agree that a system designed from the ground up to find collisions would be significantly better.

I don't really understand how multisig is supposed to make stuff more smooth. It really just seems to introduce additional points of failure. Care to explain how in this case it would make it smoother?

Food fuel and energy are often excluded from CPI calculations because they are subject to non-monetary supply shocks and thus are too noisy to use for any kind of mid-term inflation index. The fed typically publishes both.

Falkvinge, I've enjoyed your analysis of bitcoin over the years. However, on this one its evident you're operating significantly outside of your understanding. Debt-issued currency (dollar, euro, pound, yen, etc.), has a built-in market based price fixing: interest rates are adjusted to encourage or discourage borrowing so that the price remains the same. Because of Bitcoin's fixed supply and lack of such a price fixing mechanism, it is impossible to use USD velocity as any kind of sane benchmark for the store-of-value usage of Bitcoin, and arguing that you have done so is ignorant at best and deceitful at worst. I encourage you to use asset velocity benchmarks instead. Additionally, it is incorrect to exclude segments of the market from a velocity calculation as you do in your analysis.

Raise interest rates (of course, then the government would stop being able to afford its deficits, but that's not the Fed's problem... or it shouldn't be)
For historical example, see early 1980's

wages are sticky, so if bitcoin ever becomes more stable (read: significantly higher volume and global investment and adoption), the stickiness of wages will mean that deflation gradually raises wages over time.

This is a strange viewpoint to get at from the data. Most bitcoin commerce up to this point has been USD-based, followed by EUR. A historical viewpoint would then indicate that China was slow to move in this case, but neither point is really strongly made from this data. The real early movers were the original miners, and we don't know where all they were from.

8% rates only showed up briefly in the early 70s, correlated with high inflation.
11+% rates were only briefly around in 79-85 as part of the central banks efforts to curb inflation. Your view of CD's as giving a stock-market like rate of return historically doesn't seem supported by the evidence except for a very narrow window.

My review 3.8/5, they don't have a verizon contract plan but it was unclear to me initially. They refunded my coins after a wait and some periods without communication. Seems like its just growing pains. I plan to use them again in the future.

Final Update:
Received refund after a waiting period to make sure that Verizon cancelled the transaction on their side. Upgrading the review to 3.8/5 for customer service resolution. There's still a lot needed in terms of feedback to the user, but I intend to try them again at some point with a different carrier.

Consumable value sets a floor on the long term price of a good. But moneys always trade at a significant premium to this because their primary value is for exchange. I think the thought of some floor is comforting to people like you and Schiff, but returning to that floor in e g. gold's case would be disastrous for him, and probably for you if you invest like him.
