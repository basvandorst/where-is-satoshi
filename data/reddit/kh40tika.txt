I use two physical machines. One serves as NAT router for the other coin machine. The coin machine installs a "quiet" OS that doesn't generate much garbage traffic (e.g. Kali Linux), and the router machine runs wireshark to detect suspicious traffic at any time.
I NEVER run cryto or banking stuff on Windows.
