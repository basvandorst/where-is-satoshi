My girlfriend mentioned Bitcoin in a conversation I can't recall at the moment, to a new friend of ours while we were out partying in the woods around a campfire one night with a group of 7.  Talking with the whole group, our friend blurts out, "haha Bitcoin is so stupid, isn't it?.." realizes we don't agree and comes back, "Oh, do you guys like Bitcoin? No offense".  The fact that he thought I would be offended raised my curiosity about his statement even more. "I'm not offended at all.  Why don't you like it?"  He had no answer.  Like he was going to hurt my feelings or something, he could express no reasoning behind his claim.  I still wonder what makes him think it is so stupid, but I don't really think he even knows.

Great video!  I appreciate Erik's candidness and agree with him on many points, especially how he says dogecoin's usefulness is that it is funny.  The fun of the meme is welcoming to someone who has never heard of cryptocurrency before.  It's also good for those who just want to feel rich with a few thousand doge.  This has huge implications for getting people to understand how cryptocurrency (and let's be real, Bitcoin) works - especially with killer services like shapeshift that change the climate of how these coins interact.

Yes interpreted, but how far off, really?
He mentions Swiss bank accounts because people use them to get around US capitol controls.  It's not really that far of a stretch that this kind of logic also applies to cryptocurrency, which by default is encrypted and outside of government control.
@_date: 2016-03-31 06:16:02
Generate keys on an offline computer.  Write down you public and private keys so you don't forget them.  Send BTC to that address.  You now have a nice cold storage. Edit: Preferably spread among a few addresses.
@_date: 2016-03-12 17:35:34
Encryption = security = gov can't get in = people might be up to bad activity ("child pornography, terrorism, **tax evasion**") = no one should do these things = encryption is bad. 
Obama then mentions "everyone walking around with a **Swiss bank account** in their pocket" to denote how people get around government capital controls.
Those sentiments have absolutely nothing to do with cryptocurrency/Bitcoin, or even regular currency/money huh?  
..Alrighty then!

"Bitcoin is not going to bank the unbanked - it is going to debank all of us." [-Andreas Antonopoulos](
@_date: 2018-06-29 19:52:06
Bitcoin is new tech.  It hasn't even been around for 10 years and it's just this year hitting the mainstream.  To think open source, ever programmable, censorship resistant money won't evolve and present different use cases for different people is kind of sort sighted.
As for the unrealized aspects: most of the people who are new to Bitcoin have never even made a transaction, let alone take possession of their private keys.  Many of those who bought within the last 6 months to get in on the action don't know the fundamentals of why p2p currency is valuable.  Those people may be gamblers, or even parasites as their whole aim is just to make a quick buck.  Thing is, once people see Bitcoin continually outperform sovereign currencies and many other financial tools, the validity of those centralized fiat systems will be questioned more.  
Bitcoin would have never went from $0-$19k to where it is now if people didn't have a reason to own it.  Look at today's geopolitical climate and tell me financial uncertainty isn't already a worsening issue. Call owning BTC a gamble if you want.  Big risk = big reward.  Personally, I see hodling BTC as a more constructive and safer bet than holding onto dollars that will continue to lose value.
@_date: 2016-11-19 03:39:19
That's cute.
@_date: 2018-06-29 01:48:16
You don't sell (HODL!) because the potential of this tech hasn't been realized, mostly because of the huge learning curve among other hurdles that can be overcome. 
Go ahead and try, but it's not that easy to time the market.  If the price goes up drastically as it has time and time again and you're holding onto fiat, you're going to feel pretty sheepish.
If you hedl anytime before last December, it's pretty explanatory why that was a good strategy. 
Bitcoin was created as a peer to peer means to expose the fraud of central banking and debt based fiat currency that can be printed infinitely, not for people to use as a tool to put more dollars in their bank account.  If you believe in that, one more reason to HODL, ride it out, enjoy the show.

@_date: 2018-06-29 21:07:14
Fair enough.  It might still be a while until we can truly say BTC is a store of value.  It's pretty much in a perpetual state of price discovery which is really cool considering it is the closest thing to a free market one can be involved in.  Watching the chaos unfold as the ecosystem chugs along with no rulers is pretty interesting.   I think that is where a fair deal of it's power lies as no central player with a mass amount of power/wealth can easily co opt the project.  You can't really say that with traditional markets.  
You have to take personal responsibility for your wealth, which some may fear, but others love.
It is definitely an overstated meme.  It's healthy to spend BTC too.  Though considering the whales and turbulence of the market at times, HODL is probably here to stay.  Again, if you have no further reasoning to own BTC beyond making more fiat money appear in your bank account, you probably should sell now.  Then again, HODL for a few years and read up on what you invested in and you might realize you purchased something more valuable than you previously thought. ;)

Bitcoin is peer to peer cash at its most basic function.  Am I to believe Skrill doesn't know this, or was this move deliberate?  I see this move as a means of trying to wipe the idea of p2p trading from new users.  Makes sense as most "investors" jumping into Bitcoin today could care less about it being a better money and just want to cash out eventually anyway.
When Skrill follows compliance they're still spying on you.  Doesn't matter if they have to by law in order to stay in business.  Bitcoin was not created so the people you buy it from will have all of your personal info.  The opposite actually.
The point is that Skrill isn't allowing people who use their service use Bitcoin as it was intended, but instead as an investment tool to prolong the life of fiat and fiat payment processors alike.
 
Fact is you don't actually own Bitcoin if you bought it from Skrill until they allow p2p trading.  Period.
@_date: 2018-07-25 20:00:58
Remember: Not your keys, not your coins!
You can buy bitcoin, but Skrill won't even let you use it besides selling it back to them. 
Bitcoin is about becoming your own bank and making these money/invasion of privacy grubbing companies take a hike.
This looks like a desperate move to stay in business as BTC will continue to eat payment processors' lunches until the beast of fractional reserve currency is starved, ushering in the satoshi as the new standard for money.
@_date: 2018-07-27 16:13:50
You're not wrong except for the quality needing time part.  I'd argue Skrill should have waited longer for a fully legitimate release if that is true.  Unfortunately in this case, legal approval means stripping BTC of its most basic features, not allowing users to utilize it as it is intended.    Again, BTC was not created for one to bank through a 3rd party for any period of time..  In my eyes, regulators want this kind of legal roadblock put on exchanges to slow down cryptocurrency adoption and the new way of thinking that comes with it.  It's not all Skrill's fault, but it is partially on them.  The average newbie trying to figure out how to get some coin with them is being blocked out of features that come standard if you own your keys.
If you want to *actually* own Bitcoin today, there are better options.
@_date: 2018-07-27 00:01:57
I don't mean to single any exchange out, a lot of which aren't that great for the psyche of Bitcoin either IMO - Skrill is just another trying to meet consumer wants/needs.
All I mean to point out is if you buy Bitcoin anywhere, you should be able to take sole possession over it and move it to your own wallet to which you can secure your private keys.  If reputable companies like Skrill understand Bitcoin is valuable largely because of its disruptive nature to be your own bank, they know this.

First, it's not an investment, it's a currency you are speculating on if you are hodling it hoping it will gain value.  The main reason Bitcoin is so baller isn't because it's fast or cheap (even though it's still both considering the modern banking system), but that anyone anywhere can transact without a bank or government entity having any say in it.  Its main utility is decentralized currency separate from the state.
