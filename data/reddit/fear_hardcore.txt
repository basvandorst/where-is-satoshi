I don't think that ECDSA keys would hold long under torture of the person in the car.
But thanks you for making me chuckle :)

I think that the getbalance [API call]( key]&amp;action=getbalance) is not properly documented, the order of values in the response is not the same as in the [doc](

I think it's not really their fault, as they are entities which deals with dollars and other fiat currencies, they are required to observe Know Your Customer rules.
I don't really know the deal about Social Security number in USA, but in France it would never be required (just ID card).

Electrum + Bitcoin-QT, that way I can have an easy to manage offline wallet and still contribute to the Bitcoin network

I would really like to purchase some items from BitcoinStore, but the shipping cost wayyy too much for Europe : 45$ for a 12$ keyboard, standard shipping to France...

You could have some luck with the firstbits then

I don't think that the network propagation was the problem; you can check the network propagation of a transaction on [blockchain.info](

Why are they not confirmed ? They included 0.1BTC as fee and were transmitted by the network... Maybe pool operators don't process such large transaction without human verification ?

Could you post which client you do use, on which version ans OS, I think it would help
@_date: 2013-08-14 19:37:05
I think it's because of the huge traffic which have overloaded Bitpay's image servers. The full logo appears for me now.

Thank you for this patch, i did try implementing QR code display for offline txs, but gave up. Will definitely check it out when i go home !

When I asked my withdrawal (2 month ago I think), they were processing withdrawals only on Monday, from cold wallets.
You should wait till Tuesday, and contact directly Bitcoin-central support if your request was not processed by the time

Actually, that's part of the [Bitcoin URI scheme]( Any URI can be then encoded into QR codes.

~~It's been a long time since I used their services, but did they remove escrow for cash transactions ? I can't find any way to enable it in my ads.~~
EDIT : Ok, my bad. Just tried to buy BTC from another user and the escrow process appeared. It seems to be enforced now

I watched the video (I'm french), they actually described Bitcoin correctly. They mentionned the fact that it **could** be used for money laundering, but that users are considering it more for protecting their money from problems like in Cyprus.

It would be interesting to check if those same people consider Paypal a scam, because you can't know exactly how paypal works except by blindly trust them.

I'm not an expert on it, but my friend wikipedia says




Is there any way they can collect identity information without asking official documents ?

Can someone who have downloaded it re-upload it please ?

What I don't understand is how accepting Bitcoins through Bitpay (for example) is different from accepting Paypal ?
When you pay with paypal, you just send paypal tokens (with a $, €... suffix), and only become money "backed by the full faith and credit of an issuing government" when cashing out.

You sign the transaction using your private keys, so you could sign a transaction from inputs you don't own, but the transaction would be invalided, but really that's all I could think. Except if you client is compromised too, shit will not hit the fan.

Thank you very much for this post ! I was disappointed to see so few stores accepting Bitcoin in France, and pizza.fr accepting it made my day ! Hurray for Bitcoin pizza !

You can use tabs or 4 spaces indentation, but not both in the same script.
