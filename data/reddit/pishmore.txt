I’ve been able to log in using my Coinbase log in and provided additional ID verification, but when it comes to selecting my bank I can’t find HSBC listed. I’ll have another look now and thanks for letting me know.

Okay it appears to be working. Out of interest do you have may deposit in euros or have you found a way to do it in pounds?

Thanks for your reply. I’m not dead set on anything yet, just trying to figure out the best option to get invested and as soon as possible really. I’ll look into Gemini and Gdax now.

I’m about to invest in bitcoin for the first time and I was wondering if anyone has any advice on the pros and cons of Coinbase vs localbitcoins?
I’m sure I’ve read somewhere that Coinbase charge large fees, but the also seem to have a better rate than any of the sellers on localbitcoin.  That said it won’t let me see any fees until I transfer the amount I want to spend, and as I’m planning to buy quite a bit, I’m reluctant to do it until I’m sure Coinbase is the right place.
I also heard it can take a a long time to get your bitcoin from Coinbase, whereas localbitcoin can be instant. Is the rate you buy at locked in at the time you buy?
A lot of questions, I know, but if you have answers to any of them I’d be really grateful.

Looks like gdax is US only. Was pretty much through the verification, but then can’t find HSBC when asked to select my bank. Quite odd because I know they have HSBC in the US

Can you one transfer $$ between exchanges or can you transfer BTC as well?

Thanks Jonny. My only concern is that it looks like Gemini are taking a couple of weeks to get new accounts verified and I’m keen to buy right now in this current dip. Do you (or anyone else for that matter) know if it’s possible to buy bitcoin with gdax and then transfer it to Gemini at a later date? And if so, are the any fees associated with doing that. 
I’m planning to invest in some alt coins too and as far as I understand I can do that with gdax or Coinbase and so hopefully there is an easy way to transfer coins from one to another.
