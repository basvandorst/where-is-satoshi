I’m very much a fiscal conservative who thinks ‘stimulus’ is a Bad Thing but I can’t begin to understand why a currency causing ever-accelerating deflation would make things better.

What difference does it make if there is a finite number in circulation? It’s not integer math. It is divisible. You don’t need to get hold of a coin to do a trade. 
It’s making mainstream news because it is possibly the most spectacular asset price bubble in history. It will end like all the others. When that will be I don’t know, and I won’t be buying put options - as they say, the market can stay wrong longer than I can remain solvent.

Transaction fees for a single purchase are currently worth between 2 days to 2 weeks salary to people in the poorest countries.

Most crowded trade in the world “they” say.

Yes I agree and I was fascinated by it five years ago already. It just never occurred to me that it would appreciate in value against fiat currency and to this day I don’t fully understand why it has. 
It’s a pretty shitty way of exchanging value atm until issues with transaction costs and block sizes are solved.

This is exciting. At this rate it is going up this week 1 BTC = USD$1,590,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 by December next year.

No. Chose the verify by phonecam option and snapped my DL front and back. Took 2 minutes. 
Verifying the CC may take a couple of days.

It’s not a raw material or a primary product. It is a medium of exchange, and a really really shitty one at that, until scalability and speed and cost are sorted out. 
Cow manure is a commodity. If you need to lay it an inch thick over 50 square feet, you need x cubic feet and that’s that. You can keep dividing bitcoin prices for a l-o-n-g time and keep using them. They might not make any more but the effect would just be price deflation. But it wouldn’t because the currency isn’t suitable for widespread adoption yet. And I suspect it won’t be by the time the bubble pops.

I calculated that at this rate of growth (Call it 15% per day) 1 BTC will be worth $140000000000000000000000000 by 2019. I don’t think it’s sustainable.

There is no billions as for every $1000 in bitcoin only, what, 5 cents ever left the real economy converted to bitcoin before the price shot up.  What you are proposing is like saying that when the tulip mania subsided vast amounts of money flew back into the Dutch economy.

Just remember (to paraphrase someone smart) you can lose lots of money waiting for everyone else to be proved wrong.
