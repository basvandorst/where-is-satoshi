You are probably right, wanted to say 'not equal'.

Good question, you are the only who have the solution.  
To get into BTC I recommend you to buy them, with fiat or with doge. You can go for faucet but they don't give a lot. Mining is okay if you have a good knowledge with the material and lot of money.
@_date: 2014-05-25 12:18:43
Yeah, a simple script that check and register every address from every tx from every block can do the job.  
You'll have to apply txindex=1 to the daemon to get all transactions.  
It's easy for a dev who understood the merkle tree thing, but I guess if you ask it's because you aren't dev. Can't help you to learn.

As said in the review, delay is less a drama as the difficulty isn't a factor in this product.
@_date: 2014-05-23 01:19:56
I need to correct this title: Ripple a scam from the begining, now bailing out.  
I trust in a lot of crypto, some devs are crazy fighters against this world corrupted by money. Ripple was detected as a scam from the begining, and now breaking on a high level, a lot of hopes.

700 is enough so far, most of ppls are are sharing 0...

Its maybe also useless to buy and work on BTC as long its not worldwild adopted ? You get nothing if you (or someone else) do nothing
@_date: 2014-05-21 05:39:04
I prefer this point of view so far haha ! Excellent website btw.

My article: "the role and future of 90÷ of the altcoin".  
  
Role: make money.  
  
Process:  
1. Pump  
2. Dump  
3. Wait for the awesome news*  
  
The future of the altcoin:  
4. Back to 1 or go to 5 if you made enough money  
5. Stop  
  
  
* awesome news = say the altcoin is going x11, or going POS, or claim a new wallet, or just say the awesome news is coming

Come one dude. Im angry too about this decision, but ill never boycott bitcoin in any form.  
Upvoting you anyway + this tip for the love: 69 bits @_date: 2014-05-23 01:04:09
Ofc Bitcoin is dangerous for banks and they start to realize it. The fight step just began. Thanks for sharing this article 69 satoshi @_date: 2014-05-21 22:35:29
Its a question of point of view.  
  
Only 30 countries in this list offer a +$1000 month salary to peoples. After this point it going down very fast. BTC is for all, I think the bits are a lot better when you consider all the world and not just your country.
@_date: 2014-05-20 12:11:41
Should be still inequal.  
  
  
@_date: 2014-05-23 01:25:13
I just love you.

No miracle solution, the only way I found to solve this issue is to leave Mac for a Linux distrib.
@_date: 2014-05-23 10:41:06
Errrr, I fixed that, thanks ;)

Hey bro, Im sharing the same story. Love shouldn't be mixed to money, it only lead to disasters. 100 bits @_date: 2014-05-23 02:52:52

Good work, but you didnt heard ppl saying the bot name is not what he should be.
@_date: 2014-05-26 00:17:33
It a new way to increase your fee by giving the illusion that your btc dont come from a blackmarket or so. As you can recolor a coin, they are pretty useless.
@_date: 2014-05-22 08:57:38
Just a graph with not explanation or comments. To my reddbin !

Should be easy to program a block scanner for the blockchain. Not sure it exist yet.
@_date: 2014-05-23 01:14:39
Who know ? Lets hope ! I hope for myself but I also hope peoples will wake up against this system creating sheeps. New generation is the key.
@_date: 2014-05-25 12:13:35
I think this is the solution.
@_date: 2014-05-25 07:34:34
Sell your DOGE for BTC.
@_date: 2014-05-29 07:19:05
The Bitcoin foundation job is to add/remove peoples to the Bitcoin foundation. Users can donate to the Bitcoin foundation so they can add more peoples to the Bitcoin foundation. So when the Bitcoin foundation have enough peoples in the Bitcoin foundation,  the Bitcoin foundation can say to the world how big they are. If the Bitcoin foundation spend money into Bitcoin, how they will add more peoples to the Bitcoin foundation ? 
@_date: 2014-05-28 07:03:34
I hope this is real, could push the company in the top of the year, allowing the Bitcoin to get a big publicity.
@_date: 2014-05-21 22:16:40
Thanks a lot for this review, you made me want to buy one, but I am a little worried of the 6-8 months delay
@_date: 2014-05-22 03:38:27
You should anyway never let a third party know or generate a private key for you
@_date: 2014-05-22 03:43:55
All browsers are affected. Math.random() is a javascript function to generate pseudo random numbers. As JS is visible by the client, the OP discovered it by watching into the code.  
@_date: 2014-05-25 12:23:49
Lol. This guy is just against this tech and throwing a random number as ppls here throwing random price pred.  
He could join the Bitcorn circle.
@_date: 2014-05-28 12:45:58
  
The altcoin invasion here is getting serious and really annoying...
@_date: 2014-05-22 09:10:14
I think they know the name isn't good. They maybe have project for the future that involve not only bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-05-21 22:45:12
10k sato is around $0.05, maybe for you it nothing but open your eyes because the world dont stop to your country: $0.05 is 30 minutes of work in Bangladesh.

Multisig = security but security =/= multisig.

I have lot of crashing issue with this app too.
@_date: 2014-05-20 12:21:48
Peoples are bashing you because your question is too easy. Its not complicated to register on an exchange and proceed to a bank transfer, you did not efforts so they don't too.  
From France you can try bitcoin-global for a fast transcation, but you'll still need to learn bank transfers...
@_date: 2014-05-22 09:07:33
Well, not sure about the entropy. But each browser is using differant method to generate the number. Here a good article about it:
