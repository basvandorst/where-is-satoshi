I'm not suggesting that there should another shitcoin to replace bitcoin; I'm just managing expectations. Bitcoin the technology is unstoppable just like many, many other technologies. However, bitcoin the currency is a bunch of code that is constantly being tested. The code is robust, but not infallible. So stay humble and stack sats.

Bitcoin is a game and after you DCA, you never want to stop playing. The rules are just better than the rules in dollars.

If you don't already have the blockchain downloaded and validated, I would wait for the Pi4. The IBD takes a ridiculously long time on the 3B+ so I'd copy it from another node. I already had a full node on my computer so I just copied that onto the SSD.

Thank you for your service.

I think bitcoin the technology is inevitable. Bitcoin the currency is a risky asset and not so inevitable.
@_date: 2019-07-23 01:10:42
Currency is only the first app. There's still lots of applications for a suite of cryptographic tools like digital signatures, blockchain, and proof of work.

Raspiblitz is super fun and really easy. My 3B+ Raspberry pi has an armor passive cooling case, a 1TB solid state drive and an upgraded power supply. It's running like a champ. It was about $350 all together and I learned a ton along the way. I've just left it running all the time so it's got 30+ peers connected to it.

Bitcoin can go to zero. You could lose everything. However, it has an unbounded upside where we don't know how high it could go. That's a risky, but very encouraging combination.

It is an unbelievably good time to buy bitcoin for the long term. It was also a good time at $14,000. Bitcoin is shit for short term taking and jaw droppingly incredible over the long term. 
HODL, don't trade, and learn everything you can about this revolutionary technology. Why is it worth anything? Better have a good answer to that before putting any money into it. 
Watch Andreas Antonopoulos videos to get a good start.
@_date: 2019-11-25 15:06:56
These markets can be absolutely cruel and people will get utterly rekt. Your time is well spent to learn about the technology. I'm currently enjoying the rewards of learning about it because I can get steep discounts on most things that I buy. I get 33% off anything from Amazon when I pay with Bitcoin via purse.io, for example. 
I could do that without holding bitcoin long term, but I always like being long bitcoin. I'm long bitcoin because I've learned that the monetary technology is superior to anything else out there and it's always improving.
@_date: 2019-11-25 15:11:26
Good clarification. HODL means don't day trade and don't trade with leverage. It also means save your money and don't spend frivolously.
@_date: 2019-08-12 20:54:57
I tried doing the raspibolt and found it wayy too difficult. Raspiblitz was far and away a better solution that was easy to do and there's a lot of development going on it. 
Raspiblitz will probably make you format your external drive, but you can still copy the blockchain onto it after.
@_date: 2019-08-15 21:17:32
You will probably need an upgraded power supply with no switch and either active or passive cooling.

For example I traded on HitBTC once and it was buggy and it was way, way too difficult to move my funds of the exchange. Had I researched it, I would have known it's a distrusted exchange by the cryptocurrency community. I was lucky to get my funds back.

I wouldn't discount the fact that to be a good store of value, you'll want evidence not only in theoretical terms, but good store of value in practice. Bitcoin still being here after ten years is excellent evidence.

I'm definitely guilty of being a privacy nut. I believe that privacy is a right and should be the default, not the exception. What you're gaining with coinjoins is plausible deniability that the coins you have were used for an illicit purpose. You're gaining fungibility. What do you mean by confiscated?

Fiat currency has an ever-changing supply that is controlled by the government or a governmental entity. The demand for each government currency changes as well.
Bitcoin has a fixed supply increase schedule. The additional supply quantity is reduced over time, but is known way ahead of time. The demand for bitcoin changes dramatically and alters the price. Over time, the volatility will be greatly reduced.
As for pricing goods in bitcoin, don't bother at this point. Government money is probably a better *unit of account* than bitcoin whereas bitcoin is probably a better *store of value*.

I can't recommend going to meetups enough! It makes you feel less lonely for being so interested in this really immersive technology. If a meetup doesn't exist in your area, start your own! It's great to meet new bitcoiners in the area and eventually you'll have a network of miners, buyers and sellers.

So decentralize everything until it comes to race and gender?
@_date: 2019-04-22 22:58:43
Race and gender will be irrelevant when privacy features are on by default and anonymity can be guaranteed. Until then, our existing prejudices will still play out. Bitcoin is a powerful force built on solid principles and I don't want to leave anyone behind because they lack access to good information about protecting their private keys or other critical elements of operating safely in this space.

What you're describing is called racial colorblindness and it's problematic in several ways: It invalidates people's identities, it invalidates their racist experiences, it makes color the problem ("I don't see color; I just see people"), and it hinders tracking disparities.
As Supreme Court Justice Harry Blackmun wrote, “To overcome racism, one must first take race into account.”
@_date: 2019-04-22 23:16:55
Hi Tony, 
To start accepting Bitcoin, just set up a wallet for your business using Electrum. The mobile app for Android is great. Don't worry about bitcoin cash for now. Lightning wallets are rapidly improving so you might enjoy the Eclair app.
Next, once you've made enough that you want to spend $100 to protect your earnings, buy a hardware wallet such as Ledger or Trezor.
Next, once you've read lots and want to save on transaction fees. Buy or set up a lightning node. Your customers will appreciate the lower (or nonexistent) fees and you'll appreciate the faster transactions.
@_date: 2019-04-28 18:04:46
...until the day that they don't work and the banks are insolvent and you can't withdraw from at atm. Bitcoin is  an unstoppable machine compared to the rest.
@_date: 2019-04-22 22:25:30
I think you're confusing talking about race and gender with being racist and sexist. If the system that we operate in is racist and sexist, then not addressing it is far more insidious than the whiff of discomfort I cause by talking about it.
@_date: 2019-04-23 14:58:33
Just because you deny the existence of any disparity doesn't make it go away. My evidence is attendance at meetups; it looks like a Magic The Gathering meetup with a finance twist. My evidence is also that no women have put themselves forward to speak at our upcoming conference. What's your evidence to the contrary?

@_date: 2019-04-22 21:07:07
If bitcoin is going to be a global currency, it can't just be white men using it. The value goes up with more people using it and buying it. There's a security aspect too: different people use different tools and different approaches. Those approaches may reveal new use cases and give us a more resilient protocol against different malicious attacks on the network.
Do we want everyone in Bitcoin using the same computer? No, we want a bunch of different ones all over the world; it's more secure and more resilient.
@_date: 2019-04-23 00:36:28
Bitcoin Cash has been using some misleading marketing practices to encourage confusion between Bitcoin (BTC or Bitcoin Core) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH). They are apparently pretty successful at causing confusion. 
In a more technical sense, BCH increased the block size limit from Bitcoin Core to fit more transactions in each 10 minute block. There are downsides to that change, though. The blocks are then more burdensome to broadcast for nodes and require more storage. Meanwhile, BTC has been making ongoing improvements like Segwit and Lightning.

It may be a more apparent problem in Portland since all the non-white folks either got pushed out through rent increases or because of racist policies. The lack of diversity is jarring and we now have to work extra hard to maintain diversity because it is extremely valuable.

That's a good question! There could be lots of reasons. Are there other banks to shop around to? What if the other banks give you a bad deal too? Do you have the time to shop around? Do you know that you're getting a bad deal?

@_date: 2019-04-22 18:00:06
The traditional financial system is racist. The amount of lawsuits and settlements regarding predatory loans to people of color is staggering.
Bitcoin is built to bank the unbanked and to be borderless and open to everyone. Access to information on Bitcoin is a form of privilege. So, outreach is needed to make that privilege more equitable.

A good wallet will let the user decide what bitcoin network fee they are going to pay for a transaction. The bad wallets make you pay to be in the next block, which is sometimes real pricey

Regardless of the services that Coinbase provides, those will not be functional in the event that Coinbase gets hacked. There is no FDIC insurance for bitcoin where your bitcoin funds are guaranteed. The larger the pot of money, the sweeter the reward for hackers and exchanges like Coinbase make excellent targets.
You are better off storing your funds in a wallet that only you control than trusting that Coinbase maintains adequate security practices. You can start with Blockstream's Green Wallet (iOS) or Electrum (Android, Desktop) to get started.
@_date: 2019-05-27 21:01:41
This is explained in The Bitcoin Standard. Good stores of value have a high stock to flow ratio. That means it's harder to increase the supply of money.  With dollars, we're used to a relatively comfortable level of inflation caused by an increase in the dollar supply. Since the flow of additional money is small compared to the stock of existing dollars, the dollar holds its value rather well. Gold is even harder to produce more of and we've mined tons of it already so gold is a better store of value than dollars. Bitcoin's block reward is halving soon, so its stock to flow ratio will surpass that of the dollar and soon gold. That means it will probably be the best store of value in the universe.
@_date: 2019-05-12 16:16:50
Move that off Coinbase asap...your keys, your coins.
@_date: 2019-05-11 14:36:28
Since there's money flying into bitcoin, it's reasonable to think that other coins will rise in value as well. Bitcoin has been dominating other coins though and has a much better track record than any other coin so the argument for bitcoin as a store of value is a good one. This isn't get rich quick money; it's money for savers.

Miners are bundling transactions together in a block and adding a small guess so that when the data in block goes through a cryptographic hash function, the result will have a bunch of zeroes at the beginning. 
Using probability, you can predict about how long it will take for a miner to make a successful guess based on the computer power of the network i.e. the hash rate. It's like predicting how many dice rolls it would take for ten dice to all roll one at the same time. 
The amount of zeroes required for a hash of a block to be successful is set by the network where more zeroes is more difficult. It's just like requiring an additional die  so that you need eleven dice to all roll one.
So, since you can know the difficulty of mining a block and you know how quickly the block was mined, you can back calculate the network hash rate.
@_date: 2019-05-27 21:12:09
It sounds like you're really excited and that's awesome! Before you make $25,000 decisions though, I'd encourage you to learn more about bitcoin and how to secure that value (like a hardware wallet) so you don't lose your funds when Coinbase gets hacked. Try reading some bitcoin resources on lopp.net! 
You can avoid many of the limitations of Coinbase by using a decentralized exchange like Bisq. You can also avoid troubling surveillance regulations (KYC/AML) that centralized exchanges like Coinbase have to adhere to.
