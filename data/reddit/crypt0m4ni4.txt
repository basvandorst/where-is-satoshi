did you try searching for 'market' in his inbox too? 
There are many exchanges with the word market in their name.
@_date: 2017-11-23 14:09:44
Thankfully most of those people only own pocket change in terms of the size of the market and are just trying to ride the gravy train. Real heavy hitters have been in bitcoin since at least 2010 and own thousands of bitcoins from when they were cheap, and most of them know exactly what they are doing and what bitcoin is all about.

Use search function on his email inbox. search for 'bitcoin' 'wallet' and see if he has any email confirmations. It was probably Gox though.

2 hours later you will be asking why is bcash falling? it's a pump and dump that miners run together so they can sell their bch harvest at a good price.
@_date: 2017-11-22 11:05:21
I can write you program that does that for a price. Tell me if you want that.

That makes you HalongMining's CEO, what's his name? RED FLAG AGAIN
@_date: 2017-11-22 23:04:41
LOL pretty much

That doesn't even seem possible. Your private key doesn't leave your computer/device. Websites use SSL now. Sounds like FUD. Same way they made the Tether hack seem like a Bitcoin hack. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 22:15:55
Still no block for 08:24 and counting, getting pissed....
@_date: 2017-11-23 18:55:52
Because it's the same as using fiat to buy coffee instead of buying more bitcoin. See the flaw in your logic?

The word list is available in different languages and they are standard.

Any address can be converted from/to this format. It's just another way of representing an address. So it's like the QR code but for humans.
@_date: 2017-11-23 15:08:52
Yes you are right
@_date: 2017-11-22 20:05:54
He probably used a clone website of some sort.

Have you considered engraving it into a slate of aluminum or steel? can be done with a cheap dremel.

Government will get much smaller because they can't just print money to pay for themselves. Also taxes will be much harder to collect and enforce.

They are too excited about supporting competition that they forgot to use common sense.
@_date: 2017-11-23 20:36:29
Go ahead buy it. Why do I even argue with brain dead people on the internet I don't even know. Trust your 15k dollars in the hands of people who can't make a website. I would love to hear your story in 4 months.
RemindMe! 4 months

Most people are too ignorant. They have no idea how money works and what it actually is or where it comes from or the history of it.
@_date: 2017-11-23 10:19:12
This happens to me more than I like to admit XD
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:31:14
because the difficulty is so high and will get even higher. The miner will never mine it's price in BTC. You will have to pay for electricity and they are extremely loud and require special wiring. Please don't buy a miner, just buy coins and hold.
@_date: 2017-11-23 14:58:25
The reviews were horrible and people were reporting their coin getting missing on the iOS version. Android on the other hand seems to be excellent.
@_date: 2017-11-23 18:19:56
.... delete the post .. it's so bad
@_date: 2017-11-23 08:39:10
Everyone knows that last ATH is a support line, very hard to go below. 
EDIT: changed resistance line to support line
@_date: 2017-11-23 15:03:20
A zero fee transaction will go on the next block. People pay fees to tip the miners. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 18:58:03
It's 100% a scam. Doesn't matter who said what on twitter. It's so obvious. Think for yourself.
@_date: 2017-11-23 14:02:30
I was thinking this too because bitcoin is technically complicated and you either get it or you don't. If you get it then you are smart. If you don't get it and you still put your money in it then you are a moron. That's my theory anyway.

ECDSA is quantum resistant

Don't get the gov involved in anything. Everything they touch turn to shit. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 20:55:26
even Luke Dash is skeptical. It's his OWN CEO.
@_date: 2017-11-22 15:49:53
How do you define 'Bitcoin' 
@_date: 2017-11-23 19:52:08
I had the same problem. Just made another standard electrum wallet (non segwit) and used it instead. I don't know if there are other solutions.
@_date: 2017-11-22 09:26:10
How do I use it?
@_date: 2017-11-21 23:03:41
NO ITS NOT, it's a whale or group of whales dumping LARGE AMOUNTS of btc for btg at bitterex. massive pump and dump at bitterex. best time to sell btg and buy more btc.
@_date: 2017-11-22 23:02:15
This whole thing about miners sound like they are just trying to piss off Jihan lol. I will believe when I see them.
@_date: 2017-11-22 20:03:02
Can you get power for $0.02/kWh? Also you are late to the party. S9 has been out for about two years now. difficulty is going up pretty fast. In the end do what you want, it could be fun. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 20:32:45
So what if they saw one miner. Show us their lab, show us their factory. Show us their engineers. Where is their office even located. Why do they want you to buy a whole batch and a first day sale. All those red flags and they miss it. Their website looks like a scam website. Their hashrate shows 4th/s and they say its a bug, their miner is photoshoped and they say it's because they don't have the logo. What kind of company is that. RAGE MODE
