I didn't work for my Bitcoin gains. Did I steal someone's labor?

Pulling pussy for your business associates is a pathetic way to live a life.

And then eat that ring when I get hungry.
@_date: 2019-10-06 01:13:49
This is gross.

S&amp;P will only exist for another 8 years or so.  Finance as we know it is crumbling before our eyes.

Bitcoin is money, fiat is ponzi.

Yes, a very small white paper.

The U.S. will have to print its way out of the next recession.

Actually quite woke.
@_date: 2019-06-18 17:49:45
Yes, but with Bitcoin Cash it isn’t.
@_date: 2019-08-18 03:46:30
Yes, sell it to me.

It was a long winter.

To wipe away your shitcoins.

Someone apparently doesn’t buy single hits of LSD.

Congratulations on paying for that baby's retirement at 20.
@_date: 2018-03-18 00:11:59
And bitching shitcoins
@_date: 2018-11-18 07:23:52
At 1.5k that’s still up 300 percent in 2 years.
@_date: 2019-01-23 00:18:56
They seemed to like it a lot more at $20,000...
@_date: 2019-09-19 18:58:13
Congrats, that is a very large Bitcoin. It was likely minted when Bitcoin was around $18,000.
@_date: 2019-05-27 17:34:43
Whale life.
@_date: 2019-05-12 01:06:49
But I will fomo and buy at $10k
@_date: 2019-05-27 04:34:14
Fomo is when my pyramid scheme friends on Facebook start talking about Bitcoin. Can't believe  I missed that sign in the last bubble ��
@_date: 2019-05-27 02:50:12
I decided to buy 10,000 Bitcoin today.

You'd sound like less of a kook if you spelled imminent correctly...
