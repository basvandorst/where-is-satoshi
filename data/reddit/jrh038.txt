Yup,  I see this as a growing trend too.  The world is connected in a way it never has been before.  Russia is a nation that is about as "sanction proof"  as a nation can be in modern times.  They are a huge resource exporter with a resource in high demand.   
I almost see this as a weird acknowledgement that the energy market is about to be completely changed.   Russia has stirred the shit in Ukraine for a lot of reasons.   Least among them,  the embrace of alternative energy in Europe. 
It will be interesting to see what happens going forward.  I really thought with that huge energy deal, Putin would back off.

With thousands of unfilled orders, is that a joke?   I've used the service in the past.  I have zero confidence that I am ever going to get my money back, or see 1 BTC from that transaction.    We're also past the "well intentioned"  point.   The thread, linked by OP, has some of the worst customer service I've seen in my life.
Btw,  it's stuff like this that makes we wish we did have regulations.

Let me know how it works out if you do use it.  I've ordered btc's though bitinstant over 24 hours ago, still no coins.    Wake up call to me that I need to diversify my purchasing options.

Honestly, at this point.   This not being the first time.  I'm not sure I would call them a great company, or even good.   They are simply in a niche not many fill.  They do an extremely shitty job of it.    I'll make sure to never buy through them again.   Lesson learned.    
I have no idea why this thread is getting down votes though.  This needs more visibility here.  
P.S.  Only one person has downvoted in this thread?  Was that you?  Do you work for bitinstant?

Oh man, I still have a pending order from three days ago.  That has not been fulfilled. This post needs to be near the top to warn others to not use the service, ever. 
These guys need to fold one way or the other.   The site also needs to come down.  They are still taking cash deposits.  That alone makes them appear to be nefarious, and criminal in nature.
