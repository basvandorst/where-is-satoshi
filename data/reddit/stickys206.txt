Using the multi sig vault at Coinbase gives you complete control over your btc.

Happy holidays fellow bitcoiners! Here's to a great 2015 in the crypto world!

I've bought a bunch of stuff from Richard Sherman's website. You mad bro?
@_date: 2014-11-30 03:02:48
Yeah it sucks they were allowed on the BCBF site. Unfortunately there's a ton of people that take advantage of Bitcoin users. That's why I only shop at the bigger more trustworthy merchants that accept Btc. Hopefully you'll get your btc back.

If I put on my glasses, I can see better.

I got my $10 from circle and moved it to coinbase.

Good for you! I just left my job to work at a bitcoin venture. Very exciting!
@_date: 2014-07-30 18:36:39
Yes it is. For registered non-profits.

They aren't getting the minon  chips until 5-7-14. You'll be waiting for at least another week.
@_date: 2014-02-02 05:41:50
They're working on adding support staff to help out with these issues. Hopefully you'll get the answer you're looking for soon.

Demonoid has been gone for almost 2 years. The "new"  version isn't private at all. Might as well use the pirate Bay.

Black arrow is delayed until may.

Not sure who Coinbase uses, but I know Ally bank is Bitcoin friendly, at least with Coinbase buys and sells.
@_date: 2014-12-03 09:27:33
In Mexico there's mexbt.com and bitso.com. The U.S.  and parts of Europe there's Coinbase. 
@_date: 2014-03-30 05:25:24
Ask Coinbase to disable log ins on your account until you get it figured out.

Daily dealy is super scammy. Do a search for their reviews. Once your btc gets sent to them, there's not much Coinbase or you can do except beg for your btc back.  
@_date: 2014-01-26 04:07:05
Scam much?
@_date: 2014-02-07 03:12:40
Crypto coffer 
@_date: 2014-11-17 14:36:48
Same here. I get paid entirely in BTC.
@_date: 2014-01-30 23:59:35
Coinbase is hiring a bunch of support personel to take care of the backlog
@_date: 2014-12-03 08:12:07
Overstock holds a portion of their Bitcoin. One of the few companies that do.

As Bitcoin becomes easier to use, I can see large retailers like Walmart accepting Bitcoin.
They could install a BTC kiosk/ATM that explains how to download and install a wallet to make it easy on the customer. They could have the customer use the wallet of whichever payment processor they use Coinbase, Bitpay. When using a payment processor wallet, they wouldn't need to wait for confirmations, as the transaction would be instant, at least it is with Coinbase. 
They could then offer a discount for using Bitcoin. To the average  
Walmart customer, even a small discount would at least get them to check it out.
I'm sure the integration might be a PITA, but it would definitely help spread adoption.

Glad that MS is accepting BTC, but I don't own a single product of theirs. Oh, and Bing is a joke. 
@_date: 2014-07-30 21:39:01
My bad. I thought you were referring to non-profits specifically.
@_date: 2014-12-03 09:37:30
If anyone is close to "centralizing " Bitcoin, it's the U.S. Government or Satoshi himself.  
@_date: 2014-02-23 09:22:29
Payments that use coinbase api are instant. Using one merchant gateway to pay another is the problem. I like the mycelium idea.
@_date: 2014-03-08 01:00:46
I use ally as well. They're great to use with coinbase.

Have you contacted CB support? They can provide order specifics that may help Dell c.s. locate and fix your order.
