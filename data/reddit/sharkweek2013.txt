Sorry, I was wrong! I just double checked. After you enter the amount you want to purchase it takes you to a second page to confirm, and on this page it shows the transaction fee.

Thank you for asking this. I was wondering the same.

I’m with you on this one. Totally anecdotal, but my brother in law bought in for the first time yesterday without any influence from me. We haven’t talked about BTC since last year when I first tried to explain what it was. In the last week I’ve had several friends bring it up to me as well. I don’t know exactly what spurred this, but word has definitely reached the masses in the past couple weeks. Last 48 hrs have been absolute bonkers especially.

I noticed that too. If you do make a purchase, you should get a receipt/confirmation emailed to you. 24 hrs ago was my last purchase for BTC and the fee was 1.486%
EDIT: I was wrong! I just double checked. After you enter the amount you want to purchase it takes you to a second page to confirm, and on this page it shows the transaction fee.
EDIT2: I just realized you said credit card payment in your post. CC payments in the US have a fee of 3.99%. I have a linked bank account which has the fee of 1.49%. Sorry for my bad info up top. I would strike it out if I weren’t on mobile.

I’m wondering about the advantage of ID verification as well. I’ve had my Coinbase account for years but I didn’t really think of BTC as an investment until recently. I made a decent purchase when BTC hit 10k, and the transaction wait period was for a week. 
Last time I purchased BTC it was instantaneous. I finally downloaded the app and noticed the verification section under settings. After several failed attempts to verify my Driver’s License, it finally went through.
I was hoping the identity verification was the missing component to a quicker transaction, but it doesn’t look to be the case. As a test I purchased some ETH earlier today but this transaction also appears to be pending for the next week.
