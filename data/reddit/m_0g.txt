Now all that's needed is to store the chain using PingFS, potentially even in the pings being sent for the DDoS.

I don't believe this is true, I'm pretty sure a proof of concept is enough actually.

I appreciate that I have a right to vote, however I don't see my decision not to vote as purely selfish:
It is commonly mentioned around election time that youth don't vote, and I think it is frequently attributed to youth simply not caring, or maybe being lazy (as is a large part of my decision not to vote, since if I don't think it would make a difference, why waste the time?). But to me it's more complex than that: if I did go and vote (and other youths also did) then instead of news about youth not voting, there'd just be news that the X party is voted for a larger amount, or that youth largely support X party.
I would rather there be news that the youth don't vote since maybe one day a reporter or politician will think "hey, youth don't vote, but maybe its not because they simply don't want to" and would actually try to find out what we DO want rather than just trying to convince us that we should just pick the least bad option, even if you think they are all bad.
The only way for better options to appear is to make it known that other options are desired. So if I were taking things into my own hands to the best of my abilities, I would try to get the word out that other options are desired and the values that I hope the other options have. But frankly, that would take a lot of time and energy (far more than voting) to make any possible impact, and there are other things I want to spend my time doing. So I don't vote, and hope that someone with the time to commit to such an effort as I just described will eventually come along and try to make things better.
Also, I don't have a lot of faith in politicians, but if they do their job in their best interests (try to get elected), they should eventually start to wonder what they could do to get all those votes that go to no one.

Well in Canada, "none of the above" is actually an option, it's just not made obvious, so this is what I would do to ensure my vote would be interpreted unambiguously.

Ah, apparently it can only be done for provincial elections in certain provinces: 
I heard about this just before the recent Ontario provincial election.

As I said, its not made obvious; the option isn't even on the ballot. When you receive your ballot you return it to the official who gave it to you and state that you decline your vote.

I believe I should actually be "declining" my vote (that's what I think the technical term is for it), in which case it is marked specifically as "this person chooses none of the above" rather than being grouped with what's considered as "this person didn't know how to vote properly", which is the case for a voting card that is spoiled.

Although I can't speak for the majority of people, speaking for myself as a young person, I don't feel a strong urge to vote since it doesn't matter who I vote for, no candidates appear to represent my views on what are key issues to me.
Personally, i think the issue isn't who is elected, its who is running and the system in general. I'm not going to pretend I couldn't do more, but I don't see how voting would make a big difference in the issues that concern me. My point is that although you may be correct that the youth don't vote, how would that fix poor government decisions when all parties seem uninformed or just don't seem to care about things like the people's privacy?

I see, thank you for the explanation

What is he talking about with this interest rate of 0%? I was recently looking around at loan options a bit, and let me tell you, the interest rates i was offered were certainly not 0%...
I'm not trying to say I think he's necessarily wrong, but I have no idea what he's talking about.
