Fair point there.
But most of the user here only hold btc for investment purpose. When the value stabilize, and btc value no longer appreciate, do you think btc is still attractive to be use in daily transaction? 
Let say that the value stabilize at usd 250,000/btc
Then the investor will look for new investment opportunity on whatever it is in the future because btc is no longer profitable. Once investor sell, btc value will drop since large portion of btc is now held for investment purpose.

Growing room for investment you mean? 
From what I see it, any attempt to promote BTC/crypto is only for the purpose to increase one's investment and not for the adoption as currency

I didnt mention fiat here. But every newcomer is buying Bitcoin just for investment purpose and not for the actual reason it is invented or the reason that this sub believe
Even the statistic posted somewhere in this sub shows that the transaction amount is very low and adoption in daily spending is minimal

Buy back with what? Fiat?
Why dont people just spend fiat to purchase/pay stuff instead? Wouldnt that slow the adoption of btc other than investment purpose?

More places accepting/adopting btc is one thing
User actually spending their btc at those places is another
How long would it take for btc to stabilize that spending btc is actually worth it? Can businesses wait that long as people is holding their btc instead?

Legitimizes BTC or other crypto for that matter to the public thus increasing its value along the way?
So is it really about doing transaction? Or just to increase your invesment value?

Because air is abundant? 
Isn't crypto is scarce by design? Are we creating artificial scarcity?

I spent crypto too, but Bitcoin?

I don't understand. Can't people just switch to other cryptocurrency knowing that Bitcoin is no longer 'affordable'

Rocking the financial world? As a speculation maybe.
As an actual currency? Really doubt it

That's why fiat actively used in daily transaction. 
This sub only promote Bitcoin as a form of investment but masked it as if it is the best form of currency. This sub only care about the appreciating value of Bitcoin/Crypto but not the intended purpose of it
