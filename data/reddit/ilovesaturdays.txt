Digital scarcity, more than any other feature makes Bitcoin Bitcoin.  What alt pumpers can't see is how alts undermine this first principle, and therefore any value propositions of a new coin.

The reverse in fact.  Check out Thiers' Law.  Greshams's Law assumes legal tender laws, hyperbitcoinization will see no such thing.  For a historical analog, look at the dollarization of large South American economies.

I'd encourage you to [read the full JEP report]( . Rogoff suggests a number of ideas central banks might employ, for example, implementing a two-tiered currency with digital cash held near the zero bound and physical cash redeemable at say 97%.  Also, why not eliminate $100s and $50s from circulation while raising insurance costs for institutions who might consider storing cash in a negative interest rate environment (banks and pension funds).  Central bank policy during the next big recession is going to be very interesting indeed!

Illuminating perspectives from Harvard professor Kenneth S Rogoff, former IMF and Fed economist.  
TL;DR: Professor Rogoff argues for the elimination of the $100 note.  Bitcoin and alternative currencies mentioned at 26:30.  Cites "scalability" concerns with Bitcoin at 28:14.

Ok listen.  Notwithstanding the myriad problems with Ethereum's premise and architecture, Bitcoin is a protocol, with a bitcoin token built in that rewards miners for securing an immutable ledger.  That protocol continues to be developed and expanded, and will eat whatever smart contract use cases ethereum's scam artists dream up.

Emergency difficulty retargeting was a hack BCH gave the chain to help jumpstart mining.  Dumbos did it asymmetrically though, so it's opened up an incentive for miners to jump back and forth between BTC chain and BCH depending on profitability.

BTCs difficulty adjusts approximately every 2 weeks (2016 blocks), upwardly and downwardly, so the effect of this chain hopping attack is negligible.  BCH's EDA only adjusts downwardly, over a 12 hour window.  Read Van Wirdum's excellent write up if you'd like to learn more: [link](

I'm of the belief that alt coins are basically illiquid short BTC positions - a hilarious degree of risk
@_date: 2017-05-08 21:18:00
Either we're in an alt bubble, in which case all of that "value" will one day roll back into Bitcoin, OR Bitcoin really is losing market share to alts.  If the later is true then all cryptocurrency projects, including Bitcoin, will fail.  N-alts in the marketplace challenges the most fundamental property of Bitcoin: digital scarcity.

SHA-1 is still pretty tough to crack.  The 2017 exploit was a collaboration with Google and took 9 quintillion computations (that's 110 years on a GPU). Off the shelf cloud computing costs to crack SHA-1 would probably run you in the low 6 figures.  Maybe CC companies ran a cost analysis to upgrade to SHA-2 and said f* it?  Beats me, def some exciting opportunities out there if you have access to serious computational power!

I've enjoyed Jimmy's posts and admire his effort to remain neutral (which I frankly think is a fools errand) but not mentioning ASICBoost as a rationale for miners' behavior is just equivocating.

SHA (Secure Hashing Algorithm) is a set of cryptographic hash functions that make up the one way "trapdoors" bitcoin relies on.  NSA published these tools back in the 90s, SHA-1 generates 160bit hashes.  Back in 2005 we found some vulnerabilities in it, and recently researchers found examples of collisions, basically showing SHA-1 can be non trivially broken.  This has lead to the development and adoption of SHA2, far stronger and now the recommended standard.  SHA256 is a derivative of SHA2, it generates a 256 bit (32byte) hash, far tougher and for the moment safe from attack.

You need a fixed block size, for a whole host of reasons.  But regarding fees, if you double the block size, you'll lower fees in the short term, but with lower fees you'll encourage more transactions and then you're back with full blocks and higher fees.  It's a bit like when you build a new highway to reduce traffic.  Offchain or L2 solutions are necessary if you really want to see bitcoin scale exponentially.

This is exactly how I believe things will play out. Exchanges will play the role of kingmaker because they will insist on a HF from the legacy side before the two coins can trade, a HF that just won't happen in time.

You're right, but block sizes left unchecked will lead to problems of network latency and ultimately centralization.  Miners will build central data centers and pass gigabyte-sized blocks between 3-4 players and then we're back at Visa/Paypal.  Decentralization is why we're all here, and small blocks play a vital role in keeping it so.
