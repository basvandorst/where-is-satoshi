The site I linked above is cited all over the place, and the author's methodology is completely transparent.  Also, this puts the conflict of interest succinctly:


as higher inflation not only has a significant impact on consumer and market 
sentiment, but, all else being equal, also results in lower reported real GDP growth, 
which tends to further reinforce the negative sentiment impact of high inflation. Put 
differently, from a political perspective, there is a systematic prejudice in favor of 
methodologies that result in lower reported consumer price inflation and higher 
reported real GDP growth.

Unlike most adopters in the news he's all too eager to explain **why** *philosophically* and in some depth, which suggests that there's more to the move than just free publicity.

Fwiw, according to George Selgin - who's studied free banking extensively - this is inaccurate.  The U.S. 'free banking' system was lobby-regulated into oblivion and was consequently a mess, but the relatively laissez faire Scottish and Canadian incarnations of free banking were not prone to systemic failures (because they knew they wouldn't be bailed out and thus didn't over-extend vs competitors) and the system worked *exceedingly* well in comparison to central banking.

On the contrary it would not only be possible, but expected.  Roads are a different matter, but if you look at the larger economic picture of a welfare state with a central bank - and its inexorable long run consequences - you may become more skeptical of its benevolent aims.  Even actors within such a government that are genuinely good are practically guaranteed to contribute to the havoc wrought - simply because they do not actually understand how the system works.

It's not about changing human nature; it's about removing governments' ability to arbitrarily spend beyond its tax revenue.  Currently a government can bankroll whatever it wants by printing more money at the expense of all of its currency holders; in a Bitcoin-as-global currency world, this would not be an option.

Bitcoin is completely different from most other industries in this regard. Because in the Bitcoin economy, you want your ideas to be ripped off and cloned: if your ideas are cloned and end up succeeding, your BTC purchasing power increases without you doing anything. Any major technological development will boost confidence in Bitcoin, and boost the exchange rate. Therefore, you can profit indirectly off of ANY success, even stolen success.

Then you've got all your answers then - no research required.  Best to just assume that because economists are highly decorated, they are correct and hold your best interests at heart.  Doesn't matter how they feel about technology, what their political affiliations are, who funds them or what their narrow slice of specialization may be: a top economist knows what's up.  Even when other highly regarded economists vehemently disagree with them.  They are always correct as a herd.  Remember: majority concensus = truth.

Despite what demagogues may say, I would argue that this is the purview of charity organizations rather than government.  Otherwise you are encouraging government growth and you'll eventually have the welfare state, then the nanny state, and then - the ultimate in 'central planning' - the totalitarian state.


I would appreciate specific [quasi] free market examples, but I would argue that on a global level, most any post-Fed economic observations are more or less distorted.


Non-stop conflict rooted in free-market economics or political machinations?


Quite agree.


In a free market, I'd contend that there will be enough prosperity to enable charity organizations to do their work.

You're right, and there are examples of progress [e.g. New Zealand is ties its central bankers' salaries to the stability they deliver] but I guess what I'm saying is that, imo, until 'central banking' falls by the wayside, moral hazard and inflationary finance rule the day and no matter what, on balance, banks will be doing more economic harm than good versus a free market economy with banks that operate within their means.

You're assuming a 'centrally planned' inflation-addled economy is desirable and/or necessary.  What 'mainstream economists' tend to leave out is that such an economy only serves to finance wars, enlarge the government and enrich the first recipients of the printing press via the network effect.

If it was a Nobel Prize, wouldn't it be called the 'Nobel Prize in Economics' - or the 'Nobel Economics Prize' - just like all the other Nobel Prizes?  Instead it is officially called the "Sveriges Riksbank Prize in Economic Sciences in Memory of Alfred Nobel" which is not quite the same thing.  It's literally a prize created and paid for by a bank.  Do you honestly think a bank is going to award that much money to anything that is not in their interest?  What if the winning economist held the view that banks - in the sense of the Sveriges Riksbank - were not a good idea?  You think they're going to sign that check?  Unlike the true Nobel Prizes, this prize contains an innate conflict of interest.
If Krugman's supporters want his work and his opinion to be respected as authoritative on the subject of economics, they should let him know that he's writing like an opinion columnist rather than the world class scientist and scholar that he really is.  Even his harshest detractors admit that his early work was impressive.
If writing in this way - impishly dancing around a subject without addressing it - is what he wants to do, then his supporters shouldn't be indignant that he is called out by those with fewer academic credentials, and they shouldn't be surprised when this happens:
@_date: 2013-10-27 22:44:31

Essentially yes, but on a larger scale.  The value of bitcoin is derived from the current and expected future ability of the bitcoin network to store and globally transfer value between parties without an intermediary.  The more bitcoin supplants intermediaries [such as banks, money transmitters and traditional currencies] in this regard, the greater its value will grow, ostensibly up to the value of those phased out intermediaries.
@_date: 2013-12-22 19:02:48
so instead of trying to understand something with your own ability to reason, your argument against the OP is to insinuate that *some nebulous person or persons* "smarter" than him disagrees in some unspecified way. Classy and compelling.  Plus that way you don't need to be "arrogant" by thinking for yourself.  Well done.  Not an ad hominem attack at all.
@_date: 2013-12-24 13:38:56
fair enough.
The OP could've drawn less fire by being less subjective in his description, but I'm not seeing an ad hominem.  Rather he seems convinced that Krugman is indeed smart enough to understand Bitcoin, citing the Nobel Prize, and doesn't get why a decorated economist would dismiss it as lightly as he has.
Anyhow, Krugman tends to elicit subjective responses because he writes with the style of a demagogue.  In this instance he brings up barbaric images, wasteful images, cites loosely supporting material from venerable forbears, and [once again] claims his opponents are 'turning back the clock on centuries of progress'.
He straight up doesn't even talk about economics in this column; or why one might prefer gold or bitcoin or fiat money in terms of actual use - or what bitcoin mining accomplishes [unparalleled transaction security] - he only talks about the sordid side topics that might get a knee jerk reaction.
speaking of a vested financial interest:
