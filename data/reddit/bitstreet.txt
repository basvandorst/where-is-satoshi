I'd bet there are a select few who are sure.
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:30:32
I love this one.
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:15:34
And Bitcoin isn't strictly a currency, it certainly isn't a fiat currency.  
@_date: 2017-05-25 18:20:57
Yes, we can see that you need to go to college, you don't need to prove it.
@_date: 2017-05-25 16:15:42
Yes, this is gentleman.
@_date: 2017-05-25 18:12:16
Obviously you are new.  As a trader you want volatility.  This is good luck for you.

Jaxx failed to integrate monero the last time they tried and were kind of assholes about it.

He's being dishonest and has shown his character over the last several years there is no point in engaging him.
@_date: 2017-05-23 14:56:02
He would have been a hero if he had walked away and open sourced SR when he was faced with the decision to kill.  He had so many bitcoins too he could have made a real difference.  Instead he was a tool.

It's not too late to breathe some life into that corpse of yours. ;)
@_date: 2017-05-24 18:41:39
You get it at the price you bought regardless of price.

Please remember this comment and revisit it when you graduate from college.

How did you ascertain his ego isn't properly inflated?
@_date: 2017-05-25 15:57:02
That article came out 30+ minutes after the dip started.
@_date: 2017-05-25 16:08:04


But that's the thing, those aren't frowned upon in while Bitcoin is.  How can Bitcoin be like those things but not be an investment?

This may be the 3st time.
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:32:03
It is the answer to the question.
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:24:17
It is working for me.
EDIT: Now it is down. :)
@_date: 2017-05-25 16:39:15
17 year old me would have done the exact same thing.
@_date: 2017-05-25 18:32:44
Thank you.

What are the options for the masses who want to invest using their 401k?  
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:34:44
If you sell now and it goes down passed $1800 you will feel like a genius.  If you sell now and it goes to the moon you will feel regret.  Which of those feelings do you think will last longer?  You gotta make this call on your own.
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:11:09
My advice is don't stop learning about Bitcoin and crypto currencies in general.  You are lucky to be entering at such an exciting time with so many different projects in the space well under way.  There was nothing when I got in and I had so much more doubt to overcome than new people do today.  Enjoy Bitcoin and remember that Bitcoin is the honey badger of money and the honey badger don't give a shit.
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:25:03
If you know for sure that it is going to $1300 before it goes back up then I would sell everything.  But only if you are sure.  You gotta be sure.  Are you sure?
@_date: 2017-05-23 21:58:08
I bet bitcoin will "fail" when they don't get whatever percent and then they will magically make money on exchanges during that time.
@_date: 2017-05-25 15:55:33
No one can answer that except you.  We do not know your financial situation.  We do not know anything about you.  Most of all we do not know what the price of bitcoin is going to be.
@_date: 2017-05-23 22:01:15
Bitcoins are not dollars, link us the transactions.
@_date: 2017-05-25 18:27:43
While you are in college, try and spend some time learning about Bitcoin.  You'll learn that metrics regarding wallets and wallet numbers are basically useless because one person can have many wallets and one wallet can represent many people and there are no good data sets to enumerate it further.  
@_date: 2017-05-25 16:51:52
Welcome to Bitcoin motherfucker.
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:20:15
No need to bet.  He said he bought a shit load.
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:45:07
I've been there.  I kept buying when all of my friends stopped.  I watched it go from $1200 to less than $200 over a year and bought the entire time every pay check.  I have bought a little from every paycheck for years.  I am now planning early retirement and they are not. :)
@_date: 2017-05-25 16:31:09
A dip started, yes.  Hopefully we end up back under 2k.
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:06:57
If you can afford to lose it I would plunk it down now all at once.  Reward is proportional to risk in this game.

Just google that string of characters.  It is case sensitive.  Chances are that you have a Casascius coin and you will find info about it with a simple google search.  Some blockchain explorers wont return results with just the first bits.
@_date: 2017-05-24 14:06:48
It will just take some good fakes to destroy the market.  Don't buy them as an investment you will almost certainly lose your premium.
@_date: 2017-05-25 19:09:55
Welcome.  This has been covered very well in most major languages and is available on the internet in many different forms.  I believe it would actually take less effort than you put into this reddit submission of yours to find it.

You are stroking it pretty hard for Ulbricht in this comments section so I'm just going to point out that the evidence for the murders was presented at the trial where he was convicted.  While murder wasn't one of the charges, the evidence was covered during the trial and not disputed by the defense.  If I was Ross and I didn't do it, no way I would have let that slide by.  Your argument that he wasn't tried for murder only works on stupid and callous people.  The evidence shows very strongly that Ross did it and intended for cruel things to happen because of money.  Because his illegal empire was threatened and he wanted to show he was the boss.  **Ross Ulbricht is not a hero.**

Most investors are not what I would call sophisticated investors.  They are mostly long term investors as well.  So they tell their guy to put a percent in GBTC and move on and watch it as it goes up and tell their other not sophisticated investor friends that they invested a percent in this thing that keeps going up.  GBTC has really only gone up.  It's pretty simple stuff.

He just said it is normal in his world and he uses it as a filter.

He heard it on Polo.
