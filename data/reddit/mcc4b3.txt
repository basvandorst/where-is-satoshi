I'm considering using this. What is the commission Bitfloor takes when cash is added via Bank branch? I use Bitinstant, but I find the fee (around 4%) to be a bit much.

Also bought 100 USD of BTC the day before this little bubble pop. lost 60 dollars so far in my wallet. Now I have to play the waiting game until it gets back to at least 12 so I can justify spending the BTC. Wish I would have waited until tomorrow to purchase the coins. HINDSIGHT.

Thank you all for your help. I feel more confidant that things will go smoothly now.

To be blunt, it's going into a Silk Road account of mine. there are 7 confirmations of the Bitcoin transaction, but then above that transaction there is another set of transactions that are from my destination account to 2 other accounts with my funds split. I did not do this. Is this normal?

Also, in the blockchain.info it shows that coins have gone from my final destination adress to 2 other adresses with the funds split? why is this?

So once it's all said and done, and transferred to my wallet, only 0.4% will have been deducted from my initial investment? sounds pretty nice to me.

and as i thank you all, the coins show up. thanks again.

How else would I be able to order the best drugs in the world? Been using BTC for 15 months and counting, and I love it.

Obligatory  post.
The service sells out quick, but if you place an order you're guaranteed coins like 30 min after you deposit cash at a bank. The dude who runs it is very nice, ~4% fee.

I sure as hell won't be giving him any more of my business. Anyone who has hundreds of thousands of dollars of other people's money and doesn't provide updates about that money is a scumbag in my book.

I was waiting for a good time to buy BTC with the USD in my account, and it looks like I'm too late now. I made a cash deposit to Bitfloor early this week, and now I'm not sure what I should do to get my cash back. I don't want to provide my government ID or bank account for the ACH direct deposit. Is there another way to get my cash back? 
@_date: 2013-04-18 02:49:57
If it comes down to it, and it's the only option, then I'll do what I have to do, I suppose. And yeah, I imagine they're getting flooded with e-mails all saying pretty much the same thing. Here's to hoping we all get our money back.
And here's to me hoping Bitfloor can re-open once again. 
@_date: 2013-04-15 21:35:44
Awesome, thank you.

This fucking guy, man. I feel awful for people who have thousands of dollars tied up. I only have $300 tied up, but it's now been 2+ weeks since Roman announced we'd be starting the refund process. No updates since from him since, and no refunds that I've heard of. So ready to get this money back.
-edit- Downvote? Thanks. I realize that Capital One is the instigator and the reason that Bitfloor was shut down, but it's the follow through that I'm angry about. If Roman had acted like AudenX has, then I would have nothing to complain about. Even when there's no news to tell, AudenX has provided communication that has been entirely absent with Roman. I find Roman's follow through extremely unprofessional, and this is why I'm most upset.

I've seen you lurking around this subreddit. I actually saw you the day you opened this service. May I ask how it's going? I'm heavily considering using this because of the WellsFargo cash deposit, and it's a plus that you're always around to ask questions. Also, what kind of fees are tacked on to a purchase of, oh say, $300? Thanks.
@_date: 2013-04-13 23:02:15
Ok well at least there's others out there that had to wait over 24 hours but got their cash in there. I'm still awaiting a response from LocalTill, and have sent them my BofA receipt and LocalTill comfirmation. Hopefully they show up soon. Thanks for the reply.

Wearing an Avengers shirt......The irony.
@_date: 2013-05-13 02:04:20
Excellent, thank you.
@_date: 2013-04-18 05:09:19
Ah, excellent. Welp, once my USD is back from Bitfloor (whenever the hell that happens) I'll have to give this a shot. 
@_date: 2013-07-29 23:57:53
He says he charges a larger transaction fee than Bitinstant, but honestly I've found that is not the case, and buying coins through his service is cheaper than Bitinstant. Mix that with his customer service and now I'm a fanboy.
@_date: 2013-11-16 09:32:57
Well shucks. So much for that. 
@_date: 2013-07-29 21:52:23
For those of us under the 3k mark, is there anything extra we should be doing? I've been waiting for some sort of notification, but have only heard what those above the 3k mark should do. Since I'm only waiting on $300, I have not set up an account with the new bank.
@_date: 2013-04-18 05:01:28
A little expensive (generally) and not as constant as an exchange type service or Direct-to-BTC Address service. I'd use it if there were literally no other options.
