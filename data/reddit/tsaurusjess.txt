You lied about who you were to use services you're not qualified to use.

No, this is only federal.

I feel you. We paid student loans circa 2013...kicking ourselves lol

Have you tried turning it off and on again?
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:46:54
And I have researched, but appreciate any insight y'all might have.

I do have a Coinbase account. I attempted to log in to gdax and received a message stating my trading functionality was suspended. I haven't been able to log in since. It's really weird lol

Your Coinbase app should let you put price alerts, however I use Bitcoin checker on Android. It alerts me to rises and falls in percentage amounts I can set myself. It's louder (cheers when it goes up, etc).

I'll be watching in case you get an answer. Though I'm more interested in the exchange side of cashing out a large sum...Good luck, OP!

Have you tried eBay?
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:56:58
It's a great feeling:) Congrats, OP.

Just for info, you may have better luck answering your question at @_date: 2017-12-08 01:43:16
If anyone is wondering...a quick Google search showed this is the correct phone number for Coinbase phone support. I don't think he's trying to bamboozle anyone. But yes, always do research.

Is this a question?

I'm assuming you're in the States? Do you pay your own taxes separate from your parents? If you pay your own taxes and are in the 15% or less tax bracket, you don't have to worry about capital gains taxes if you've held for longer than a year. If you've held less than a year, you pay taxes at your regular income rate.

@_date: 2017-11-30 08:46:33
Nooooooo.  At least not here in the States? After a year you pay long-term capital gains tax.

They are available, but they are simply no longer profitable.
@_date: 2017-11-30 09:16:10
That makes sense. My apologies.

I saw one at the Salem Center mall, too!
