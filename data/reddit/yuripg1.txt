I believe the OP meant about the brief period of stability around 565-595 on Bitstamp (and similar ranges on other exchanges), right after the rise from the bottom that you mentioned (around 455)

Great initiative to spread the word about Bitcoin.
The lack of information in portuguese was no problem for me, but if we want to see it getting popular in places like Portugal or here in Brazil, it can't be in english and/or hard to know about.

My advice is the following (and you are free to completely ignore it):
The price matters for those speculating on Bitcoin. For you, that happens to have mined a good amount, I would recommend to just chill out at this time and do nothing about it. You will get tired doing crazy stuff on a hurry.
Betting on Bitcoin surviving this though time (you may think otherwise), no matter what happens, the price will go above the current one, so you'll be able to get a good amount of money out of the Bitcoins you just found out.

I believe it was just mismanagement at its finest.

If MtGox fixes BTC withdrawals, I believe a great part of those previously stuck there (because getting USD from there is hard and getting BTC was impossible) will send their BTC to external wallets or other exchanges immediately (including Bitstamp, which seems the biggest by now).
By then, those who are uncomfortable with their recent loss (because of the price drop since they have been stuck at MtGox) will sell their BTC (and I believe it will be a significative amount). At least for a short while, this will drop the price of BTC on Bitstamp (and possibly other exchanges too).
Disclaimer: I have no skills in predicting the future, so feel free to ignore this post entirely :)

Mention that 'accept Bitcoin' doesn't imply 'hold Bitcoin'. Those other vendors that aren't confortable keeping Bitcoin can use services to get paid in Bitcoin but receive in fiat. I know it's not the best spirit for Bitcoin itself, but the popularity that having this kind of service brings to Bitcoin is ultimately good, I believe.

Maybe after the 3 days long "maintenance break" of the People's Bank of China? Until then, no bank transfers will be possible.

"Computer systems" are extremely unsafe (and this title is extremely wrong). Bitcoin isn't unsafe.
If you get malware that steals Bitcoin, you may aswell get malware that gets your internet banking account. No difference.

I think he's talking about 22:10

I believe this sort of approval by its creditors could only be achieved if there was some part representing MtGox users. No chance if it's one by one.

Very good point, if you ask me.
The removal of the 'insolvency' in the joint statement could be due to MtGox not releasing any info and simply shutting down their site.
Also, I can't help but end another post in with 'you are free to completely ignore what I'm saying'.

Indeed, the record of all transactions is publicly available to everyone in the Bitcoin network itself.

There's this public hearing on virtual currencies by the NYDFS (January, 28th and 29th) and one speak by Gavin Andresen in Washington, DC by February 6th for now.
