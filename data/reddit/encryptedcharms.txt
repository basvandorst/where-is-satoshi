ITT: why people don't end up holding all the way - they get scared and run.  The opposite of greed is fear, and it also costs people fortunes, though in a more insidious way.  
  
Enjoy your paper.  Money can neither be bought nor sold - it just changes forms.

This is like those web comics where the apprentice wizard gets too ambitious and summons a demoness (with some shoddy ass summoning circle made of low quality ingredients), who then proceeds to laugh at his foolishness and slap a slave collar on them.

Math is not an opinion and code which can be broken will be broken.  
  
Blockchains must be able to survive in a robust adversarial environment or they are useless.  Gavin is simply stating the obvious.

In the year 2056, the body of Hal Finney was stolen and the brain uploaded into a simulation designed to fool him into revealing his private keys.  
  
The attackers made off with over 300k bitcoins, crashing the global economy, though thankfully the body of Hal Finney was recovered and restored into cryopreservation.

Everyone has the freedom to withdraw $500 a day from the atm.  That should be enough for anybody.

And it seemed kind of high of a price at $450 too.  I was always worried it would fall soon back to the 300's.

This is fucked and imho we should collectively just move to a new WPA3 standard to prevent this from permanently borking security on older devices (assumed to be safe) for years to come.

To be fair, there are things that bitcoin cannot ever mathematically do.  More than just bitcoin is needed.  If you are not already familiar with the Cryptonote protocol then please familiarize yourself with it.  
  
Focus at the moment continues on public advancement of five key research pathways: next generation untraceability through Cryptonote implementations, improving proof-of-work in non-arbitrary ways such that solo-mining mobile devices fare better against mining farms, abstract second layers to established protocols like Bitcoin (ie Counterparty), experimental governance structures that aim to establish formalized rules that can avoid centralization and power struggles within a decentralized system, and advanced decentralized application testing through pre-crippled testnets such as the Ethereum platform.  
  
The coordination of all this mathematical and social exa-symphony would indicate one of many intriguing  possibilities I am sure you have already contemplated.  It is also possible this grand research is an organically emerging structure, analogous to planetary scale conscious thought. Either way, excess rumination on the cause of these developments is counter-productive, though it does make for an entertaining diversion from normal work.

Not even the greatest of fools tries to predict a top of a genuine mania.  I would estimate $4k to $25k.  
  
I know that's a wide spread.  That's because I just don't know what will happen.  No one does, and if they tell you they do, they are lying, just like I was back then when I made that post.  Your guess is as good as anyone's.  
  
But yah, the outer reaches of my speculation say $25k, though the events surrounding that would be.... Extraordinary to say the least.

I like how you get off on your sense of satisfaction for being a white male while you have done *none of these things* personally.  
  
Ultimately you sound like a racist and sexist creep who gets off on being born a certain way and just assuming you can ride the coat tails of others.  
  
Why don't you stop wanking over your demographics and do somethkbg useful for your species.  You know, other than spew divisional bile onto forums.

Bit has already been accepted as the standard moniker for one millionth of a bitcoin.  Even Coinbase accepts it.

Actually, I would love to hear about your thoughts of this technology then, and how you imagined it one day existing... All the way to now where we have almost started taking it for granted.  
  
Like, how amazing is that!  You got to read papers by geniuses if the day which basically stated that this tech may never exist (but if it did it would be unimaginably powerful), and then decades later here we are.  
@_date: 2017-06-11 16:56:37
Lol this is quietly? 
@_date: 2017-06-12 17:36:57
Turing complete means all computational operations are possible.  Most of you shills don't even know the meaning.  Second, for a financial system, you don't want Turing completeness because due to the Halting Problem it means you can never prove your DAPP is secure.  This means that expensive Ethereum systems with millions and billions of dollars in them will never be able to thrive because they will exist in a hostile environment with a million different potential exploits, and every time someone finds one of these exploits the smart contract will either collapse or manual human intervention will be needed.  
  
You want a verrrrry simple base blockchain, which slowly adds additional functionality via new layers and slowly works its way up to something approaching Turing completeness.  
 
Ethereum is the blockchain of Babel.  And it will fall.

And how exactly is this better than a three day wait after filing mandatory email support all just to get a canned response about how they are working on it?  Then a follow up email about its not their fault, to contact your bank and work it out with them why they won't accept your bitcoin sale money deposit.
