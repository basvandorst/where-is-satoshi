I wrote to Spondoolies few weeks ago to purchase more workers for my mining farm. They replied really fast and told me that they are working on a new generation of ASIC miners.
Yesterday, they wrote on Facebook that the SP50 110TH/s unit will be available. On the website, it says that this miner is for bulk purchases only. I hope to be able to purchase some of these!
You can purchase some used Spondoolies on eBay or different Bitcoin forums. Last week I bought two SP20 and one SP10 to upgrade my farm, all on eBay for a decent price and they work perfectly.

I have never tried a Bitmain miner. I only have Spondoolies machines but they seems to be efficient. With only one miner, the profit will be minimal because of the current difficulty. But if you can gain profit vs electricity cost, it's still fun to mine, to check your machine work and try to get the best configuration you want. If you can afford to buy the S5 without "hurting" your life, give it a try, you'll see by yourself. You still can resell the miner if you want.
For comparison, currently with a constant 1.4TH/s you can mine something like 0.3-0.5 bitcoin per month, depending on how lucky your mining pool is when finding blocks.

Yes, you're right. It's not the same as few years ago when everyone was able to mine with their PC video card and make profit.
If you need a fast, short term return on investment (ROI), then mining might not be the best investment for you. If you can tolerate turbojet fans noise (in a garage or something like that) and if your electricity cost is low, then you still can have a decent ROI/income with used miners running at full speed. A SP20 can be bought for less than USD$500 and hash pretty good when overclocked to the maximum it can take. You can also downclock it to hash at lower rate, have better energy efficiency, and way less fan noise. But the ROI takes longer to reach.
