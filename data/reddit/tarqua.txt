I can't help but feel like anarcho-capitalism would eventually devolve into a corporate oligarchy as those who have the most resources consolidate their power. Can anyone explain how an AnCap society would avoid this? 
EDIT: for the record I am not arguing for or against anything, just asking a question.
EDIT: Just as I am primarily concerned about the monopolization of force, I'm not saying that doesn't happen now, I am just asking if and how an ancap society could avoid this. For further clarification I'd like to look at this as if an existing capitalist society made the switch with its existing resource distribution entact.

OP Delivers! (it works)
* I like how 'clean' your site is, its pleasant and professional.
* I really like that you cant send directly to an email address. Sounds like a great way to get a friend started!
* I like the idea of easy donation buttons like you mentioned.. and wish we could have tested those.
* I DONT like how logged in users cant seem to visit your front page. 
if im logged in and open coinbase.com in a new tab i don't necessarily want to be re-directed to my transactions page.
the bitcoin community really needs these new *easy* ways for merchants to start accepting bitcoins.  
If you live up to what you offer on the home page your company could do that very well.

Seems like a reasonable delay if they had supply chain problems or something 
@_date: 2012-07-08 19:00:02
I wonder how they plan on enforcing this or if they plan to at all..

edit: the first part that is, not the sms bit.

if my bank can do bills i don't see why a bitcoin processing company couldn't do the same.
my bank pays my bills and can i can have them issue a check to just about anyone from the web interface for bill payments.  For some bills like my electricity they have a prior arrangement with the provider which allows them to handle the transaction directly rather than mailing a paper check... for other providers which they don't have an arrangement with they simply print a check that has any info the provider needs in the "memo" space on the check.. could be anything like an account number or perhaps apartment number (paying my rent)

I hope not, those were really fun. 
@_date: 2013-03-25 06:43:01
does this mean we get to order them at that time? but at a higher price than before?
@_date: 2013-03-03 19:34:33
I used it last night too! and I am hooked, I'll definitely be back
checkout process could use some improvement, perhaps instructions on the checkout page reminding you where to put the store number

I'm not trying to defend DPR and I do not sympathize with him in anyway.. He knew what was at stake.
However when we talk about this hit-man incident I think its worth noting that the target wasn't simply "blackmailing DPR" he was threatening to release user information. This **doesn't** make it right to try to have the blackmailer killed but I can see why DPR might THINK in the stress of it all that he was doing this to protect the users.

Reminds me of [Chuck Berry]( whose insistence on being paid in cash led to a jail sentence in 1979 — four months and community service for tax evasion. It's fine just make sure you file all your taxes properly.

I've used them A LOT and its kinda widely variable and may be the fault of your bank or an intermediary. Wait for the full week as usual.

Actually the president pays for meals and other services provided inside the white house so long as they are not directly related to diplomacy (state dinners, etc).
you can get a quick overview of the system and some interesting anecdotes with [this article](

I just started work on a similar project written in ruby.
I am currently distracted from it, trying to update/polish the bitfloor trading interface I wrote about eight months ago.
really cool to see someone working on this, I will definitely be keeping an eye on your repo
