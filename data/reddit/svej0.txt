withdrawal fees are clearly stated to be around 0.004-0.005 btc. people should either buy larger quantities before moving off exchange or leave funds on the exchange if small quantities in which case who really cares if it gets hacked and you lose $50

you missed it

Needed correction. Rogue Ver is retarded tho

he's correctly calling it bcash. 'bitcoin' is reserved for concensus chain
@_date: 2017-12-06 10:55:28
No doubt in my mind... when bitcoin hits 20k, she wont let you sell it
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:39:42
it will appear entirely different in a day or two. Rogue Ver is just trying to increase his btc stack

Bitcoin is the sponge to soak up all those gorgeous trillions of fiat - remaining secure is the only requirement. PoW currencies should catch some of this based on their relative hash power which is miniscule by comparison. Platforms are bubbling away but will eventually need to demonstrate ROI or implode very quickly. XRP and Iota have been intelligent enough to identify a specific use case but it remains to be seen if these are necessary once bitcoin layers are increasingly developed.

classic fem moves to religious patriarchy country cos the west is so horrible storyline - love the ending in this one tho ;)

You wouldn't. Yet! However with worldwide adoption and ease of use as a primary currency, it will represent true economics, ie. allocation of scarce resources.
The true value of the product/service and the associated opportunity cost will be truely felt by the user spending the satoshi, therefore only purchases of true value will be worthwhile.
Bitcoin will destroy the consumption based society and direct funds only to ventures providing higher utility to the user (financial, social, environmental).
It will be very costly to the individual who is shit with money, and utopia for the financially prudent

There are 3 possibilities: It will die, speculators will lose it all. It will be the worldwide currency. Or somewhere in between due to its innovative qualities that will change the world in many ways.
My perspective is that people will and are being driven into crypto due to yield (speculators) and lack of it elsewhere, or inflationary pressure (though presently unrealised in most countries). At the moment, we do have the luxury of holding  BTC since it's currency rather than asset (ETH/NEO - i have both.. and others) and does not require wide use cases to succeed or be supplanted by newer crypto assets and platforms. People are being forced into it, by whichever means they find it, whether they know it or not.

yeah fiat for groceries in the near term. 
Considering a constant block time target (10 minutes), fewer total coins remaining and increasing demand*, I think prices will become increasingly unstable to the upside until a majority transition to cryptos has taken place.
*(classic rising debt/unstable currency arguments) but also consider that most people don't bat an eyelid when they hear about $11 BTC even if it was $1 they year before, they completely neglect %gains. But when 1BTC is $10K, everyone will be piling in because they value $10K as significant in their lives, whereas $11 is lunch. I think we are going well over moore's law and expect a hockey stick at some point. I have a much larger stake in Iota, but don't expect Iota to perform like bitcoin in either the mid or long term.

I have a good BTC balance, but I dont expect to retire on it for several years even under the best of circumstances.
Keep working hard and making good decisions beyond bitcoin, cos even when youre ballin youre gonna need skills to be happy mate
@_date: 2017-08-24 08:21:21
ok thanks. i figured the effective increase in tx available in each block would increase, but Ive gathered from other subs that old tx remain and segwit tx will be viewes elsewhere
@_date: 2017-08-24 11:37:32
BTCmarkets has the lowest spread, though you'll pay a premium in a rising market. Best price is falling or sideways movements. 
Bitcoin is bitcoin. Ethereum has to continue to demonstrate leadership and dominance over rising competitors.. its not currency like bitcoin with a lower burden of proof and BTC is fixed supply!
@_date: 2017-08-17 08:08:35
Bingo. 100%. Those looking at the yield beyond satoshi will be willing to spend it. I doubt there will be as many people in the world hatching sinister plans they would spend their satoshi for
@_date: 2017-08-24 07:56:10
It was higher yesterday.. I assumed and continue to hear more transactions can fit within the 1mb block, but although transaction queue, only around 2.5 per second.. any ideas? 
not hating. I'm pro BTC

Rogue Ver is bcash. an altcoin

edit: look at 30 min chart July15-Sept20. Then look at Oct25 to now. tops and bottoms happen very quickly

just try it with $5-$10 worth the first time. consider it a small cost of learning. as soon as you sweep the paper wallet, you will have any remaining btc less fees to put back into another paper wallet for longer storage.
could also try it with litecoin if you want less fees and risk of value loss

Paper wallet is easy and safe to do offline. 1. Download github installer 2. Transfer via usb to cold computer 3. Generate paper wallets offline (with or without BIP38). You do NOT need anything from cold computer to connect online for addresses to become valid. 4. Print to PDF and apply encryption to document (especially if no BIP38) 5. You will want to test if this is your first time for your own confidence, as it can be difficult to understand how offline wallet with BIP38 passphrase can be valid onchain, but it works just fine. 5.1 Download greenaddress app (i have tested with blockchain info also). Sweep private key of address and enter passphrase (if applicable) 5.2 Your balance should now appear without any issues, though a fee will be charged for the sweep ( advise choosing fee to economical in greenaddress settings) it will be minimal 6. Hold in hot wallet or send to new paper wallet address to HODL long term. *i like the paper method with BIP38 and encryption as can be stored in multiple locations on multiple usb’s, or accessed from anywhere if held in email or dropbox. Use hardware wallet for regular use at later time.
