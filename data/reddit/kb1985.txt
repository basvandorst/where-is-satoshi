Just a quick update. Thank you for all the replies!
Just to clarify: I don't need much, basically I've been here for quite a while and now it is about surviving the last few days (food, subway, getting to the airport), co about 0.3 BTC would be enough. As you can see it is not much but sometimes it makes a difference. I took wrong Visa with me and it is not working here.
Anyway, will try some of your ideas. In the meantime I've emailed the restaurant with the ATM and was redirected to ATM owners. Asked if withdrawals are possible and got this reply.
"Thank you for your inquiry. 
You can withdraw JPY from our ATM (robocoin) - if you never have used a robocoin ATM before you need to register yourself at the ATM.(you'll need a piece of ID and your cell phone number) 
After you're registered you can buy / sell bitcoins."
Will try this one unless any of you is willing to meet at Starbucks (Shibuya or any other station to do the trade (on Sunday evening? Monday?).

Quick update. Found an ATM. Registered there. Now heading back home to fill the wallet (couldn't do that on site since I don't have internet in other places than wifi hotspots), then will try to withdraw 0.3 BTC (that's 33% of my assets but should be enough). Thank you all for help! I hope there won't be any other problems on the way.
Will keep you posted!

But do they accept withdrawals? Or maybe there is someone in Tokyo right now willing to meet in some Starbucks to do the transaction? I am going to run out of cash somewhere on Sunday/Monday. :D

That's what this idea is about. Books should be priced only slightly more than the cost of printing them and then the readers should decide what the book was worth to them and then tip accordingly.

I think that Bitcoins could also be effectively used as a method of payment by big publishing houses and not only by people who self publish in the internet.
However trust me that if I came with the idea of introducing Bitcoin payments to my current publisher/distributor they would think that I have gone mad. I already had experienced it when I was trying to persuade them to Creative Commons licence for my books. What those companies need is minor success that could prove them that such model of selling books is worth considering. And that's why I decided to start this crowdfunding project.
