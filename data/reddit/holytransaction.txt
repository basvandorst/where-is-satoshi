thank you for clarifying

Yeah! And we love art projects related to Bitcoin. Do you know more arts?

Thank you, Editowe

I was just speaking generally about capital flight. You've definitely identified the crux of the issue. Most people (doesn't matter the class) have their money tied up in the banks which are currently shut down. They can't even buy Bitcoin or, as you mention, spend it at businesses that haven't heard of Bitcoin. What can happen, though, is education about finance away from banks and governments: AKA Bitcoin.
Then, hopefully we can avoid this kind of stuff in the future.
If someone is choosing between food and Bitcoin, they should choose food.
There are Greek businesses that accept Bitcoin, the few established Greek Bitcoiners will undoubtedly be visiting them more in the days to come. Furthermore, there are international businesses that accept Bitcoin that have goods that Greeks will want, even during the turmoil. I imagine that they might also see an uptick in usage.
@_date: 2015-06-28 09:12:01
@_date: 2015-06-30 05:45:09
When there is turmoil within a country like Greece is currently experiencing, the resulting action from those in the middle class and above often involves preservation of wealth in the form of capital flight. They will buy goods (such as real estate) in other countries or goods that will hold their value.
For instance, the Bitcoin ATM in Athens might be the only way for someone with actual Euro bills to get that money into the wider financial system right now.

Yeah, you're right.
nobody is going to be arrested. Arguably, the restaurant has a ~~legal~~ obligation to accept Bitcoin since they have that sign on the door.

@_date: 2015-07-04 19:05:26
Indeed this is a very common problem. Events like this will help it become a less common problem, instead of more prevalent. 
I think it's important not to exaggerate what happened, though. In the current type of situation, **nobody is going to be arrested.** Arguably, the restaurant has a ~~legal~~ obligation to accept Bitcoin since they have that sign on the door. As a customer, the only acceptable excuse for not being able to use an advertised payment method is if the said payment network is down. Something that we know doesn't happen with Bitcoin.
The shunned Redditor was met with resistance from not only the waitress, but also the manager. Which is doubly unfortunate. However, if he had been persistent and gotten the uninformed manager to speak with the current owner, he could have paid for his drink with Bitcoin. Obviously, that is way too much hassle for one drink, let alone a whole meal.
Reviews are definitely a great way to make sure that the restaurant actually tries to educate **all** of its workers. While a restaurant might not care about a Reddit review, they will care about a blatantly deserved 1-star review on an actual review site, such as Yelp, about falsely advertising the acceptance of a payment network. The customers can, will, and are taking care of this one. However, if the Yellow Bar gets booted off of coinmap because of Reddit inspired action, it would conceivably never organically get its spot back on the map that it technically does deserve to be on. Depriving visiting Bitcoiners of the opportunity to spend Bitcoin at a restaurant that does accept Bitcoin, but just had a nasty public hiccup. We don't want to punish the restaurant forever and ever for this incident, do we?
@_date: 2015-07-30 06:03:33
Maybe in terms of media but they will be dumbing it down for the masses.

Bitcoin fixes a problem that is more or less prevalent in every country in the world. The underbanked have the technology at the palm of their hands, literally, in the form of smart phones. Bitcoin allows them to use that device and the interconnected world and tech that it represents to do finance and so much more.

The Swiss-cheese pyramid that is the current financial world is having so many of these occurrences lately. It's almost too easy to point to these catastrophic economic events around the world and see where decentralization would have changed things. Bitcoin is undoubtedly going to change the world for the better.

@_date: 2015-07-30 06:15:26
That's quite the mistake to own up to. Here's hoping the "victim" comes forward so we can understand his/her thought process, though.

He has had bigger things to worry about but he should take some time to read up on the blockchain.
@_date: 2015-08-26 20:47:25
America the beautiful they say.
@_date: 2015-07-30 06:05:57
Nice! Notarize it on the blockchain?
@_date: 2015-07-01 06:34:15
Never seen it that high before, either.
@_date: 2015-07-10 06:55:23
Bitcoin is just the payment system. Customer service still depends on the company: Reward the good ones and punish the bad ones!
@_date: 2015-07-13 23:48:31
Nice! On the grounds engagement where it is needed the most.
@_date: 2015-07-25 23:39:29
Seriously. How can other companies even compete?
@_date: 2015-07-04 03:43:45
Not barbers that's for sure...
@_date: 2015-08-14 22:32:41
Someone let the bit news sites know!
@_date: 2015-07-01 06:35:04
Arguably, this is a different type of stress test.
@_date: 2015-07-30 18:25:56
Good luck! Looks like there has been blowback against Bitcoin ATMs in Germany :(.
@_date: 2015-07-08 05:57:40
What wallet are you using? Normal in an outdated wallet could be abnormal now.
@_date: 2015-08-30 16:48:39
Seen it all.
@_date: 2015-08-07 01:36:26
Some sites have the option to change the default currency displayed... more should!
@_date: 2015-07-04 03:47:49
Because honeybadger.
@_date: 2015-07-01 07:55:14
Where would you suggest looking?
@_date: 2015-07-30 07:38:47
There are many companies in the space doing exactly that :).
@_date: 2015-07-08 08:08:26
Cool! Thanks you
@_date: 2015-07-31 21:05:08
This subreddit has a lot of customer stories from all sorts of companies, like BTCJam.
@_date: 2015-07-17 05:01:29
Not surprised by that data at all.
@_date: 2015-07-15 19:49:58
Good luck! The Phillipines is a huge area for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-07-17 04:22:53
Dilute the waters.
@_date: 2015-07-03 10:48:45
We're just happy that slowly but surely both are growing.
@_date: 2015-07-04 18:48:15
Something like that or better :).
@_date: 2015-08-26 05:28:54
Visa definitely won't listen to the small customers if they can't even listen to small businesses :(. Caleb has a stellar point about why Bitcoin is better and different.
@_date: 2015-07-01 06:36:02
Still having trouble believing that these types of headlines are now a regular occurrence when stuff hits the fan in the economic world. Go, Bitcoin, Go!!
@_date: 2015-07-25 23:41:40
The process can be used by others elsewhere away from DO, though. Baby steps!
@_date: 2015-07-04 03:45:32
Spread the word however you can, I guess?
@_date: 2015-07-31 21:05:41
Congrats to Patrick Byrne!
@_date: 2015-07-03 10:47:42
It's a legitimate question. Many people here might consider an altcoin their plan C. Plan "Cryptocurrency" if you will.
@_date: 2015-07-03 10:36:39
Congratulations to the winners!

Go help make a reddit millionaire!
@_date: 2016-02-28 17:55:03
It won't show as a regular purchase, but rather a cash advance.
@_date: 2015-08-25 07:03:42
And what is Satoshi's last will....
@_date: 2015-07-08 06:42:49
The conservative nature of Bitcoin development thus far has been the right path; however, when change is needed change must come.
@_date: 2015-07-01 07:34:32
Can't wait to use it!
@_date: 2016-02-25 20:10:14
Fake volume attributable to zero fees. Make sense?
@_date: 2016-02-10 19:18:19
@_date: 2015-07-15 19:48:12
Maybe just a little bit.
@_date: 2015-07-28 05:14:16
I think he meant cars..
@_date: 2015-07-08 06:44:01
Polar bears need heaters too! /s

Waiting patiently for the movie.
@_date: 2015-07-28 15:30:36
Thanks for the comment and provided quote! Always great when the author appears on Reddit.
@_date: 2015-07-31 20:42:54
Maybe people will use Bing now..
@_date: 2016-02-28 01:26:29
That is pretty much what it stands for for all intents and purposes.
@_date: 2015-07-28 07:33:55
Hacking isn't necessarily the only thing to consider. Read the top comment! Theymos hits the nail on its head... multiple times.
@_date: 2015-07-30 06:01:45
Sure, former director of NSA, we will take your word for it.
@_date: 2015-07-15 19:38:48
Congratulations a million times over to them!
@_date: 2016-02-19 22:47:54
The tech companies not bandwagonning need better pr people.
@_date: 2016-02-19 22:46:42
His switching over will convince so many other YouTube stars!
@_date: 2016-02-27 23:54:36
The community is confident too. Just these naysayers from both sides are so damn loud!
@_date: 2015-07-30 18:20:27
This is a major step for Bitcoin in Argentina.
@_date: 2015-07-04 03:47:18
The media is hung up on voat and reddit for now, since it is easier to paint things as black and white. Hopefully empeopled gets that attention soon.
@_date: 2015-07-04 03:38:13
Thank you so much for giving us your candid thoughts. The team at HolyTransaction relates deeply with your story of developed distrust in the current financial system.
@_date: 2015-07-01 06:31:18
Listening to Voorhees speak on Bitcoin is always an inspiration! Thanks, dude!
@_date: 2015-07-31 20:43:14
Slowly but surely getting better.
@_date: 2015-07-27 04:01:00
Not even with a computer powered by the sun.
@_date: 2015-07-10 05:47:14
I was referring to the company [HolyTransaction]( Hope that clears things up, haha.
@_date: 2015-07-30 18:24:07
Bitcoin 2.0 is a general term. Actual Bitcoin core won't be at that version for awhile..
@_date: 2015-07-28 05:15:06
Hell yes! Craigslisters are a smart bunch like that, usually. Cost saving and p2p are kinda intrinsic tenants of the community.
@_date: 2016-02-28 04:50:12
Anything is possible with bitcoin :)
@_date: 2015-07-01 06:33:16
Have no doubt that a government might label Bitcoin as "foreign" if needed, though.
@_date: 2015-07-28 05:16:08
Hope everything works out well for you.
@_date: 2015-07-17 04:24:41
Detained in Croatia it says.
@_date: 2016-02-17 09:54:57
I hear there are even other bitcoin companies seeking to enter this exact space.

He speaks the truth.

The email was the result of a disgruntled employee's reaction, but we would like to assure you that we have took actions and there will be no further hiccups.
We have decided to rebuild from scratch the entire infrastructure into new machines and the team is working around the clock to be back online very soon. Stay tuned!
Kind regards,

Hi! What is your support ticket number?
@_date: 2015-09-15 16:13:48
This is really awesome. Do you hope to attract academics writing about Bitcoin or established Bitcoin users as writers more? 
@_date: 2015-09-12 02:23:11
Hopefully they will loosen up on that soon.
@_date: 2015-09-18 18:39:02
It is all about abuse. If nothing ties public addresses to real identities... why not make multiple?
@_date: 2015-09-08 15:31:02
I should have added my /s. Bitcoin news sites will say anything to stay relevant :p.
@_date: 2015-09-17 17:55:19
I'd say the Fed has influenced all of us.... pushed us towards being Bitcoin enthusiasts :).
@_date: 2015-09-11 17:53:15
The blockchain will be behind so many future apps..currently, we probably can't even fully comprehend the killer apps that will come out.
@_date: 2015-09-12 02:16:52

How is the satoshi square nowadays?
@_date: 2017-10-14 16:47:31
love it
@_date: 2015-09-11 02:30:34
Yeah. Things need to be easy for the non tech native. 
@_date: 2015-09-22 22:20:48
Interns will get to read it :).
@_date: 2015-09-15 16:16:55
Thanks to bnc for taking the time to do this.
@_date: 2015-09-05 20:37:57
Debt that has been passed down for centuries...
@_date: 2015-09-05 20:11:46
What did they originally offer?
@_date: 2015-09-11 01:17:47
How many of the 45 were Bitcoin related, I wonder.
@_date: 2015-09-17 20:01:46
Not bad not bad.
@_date: 2015-09-01 16:37:19
Thanks, BitFury!
@_date: 2015-09-06 22:20:42
Pretty much everything is a niche for those guys,  haha.
@_date: 2015-09-01 02:26:45
Is this the PHP farm that Mt Gox's code retired too as well?
@_date: 2015-09-11 17:45:35
It will be a while before they get it.
@_date: 2015-09-20 18:52:45
You will eventually be able to "predict" it with Auger or Truthcoin.
@_date: 2015-09-01 04:23:22
We all already know that the blockchain is the future of record keeping :).
@_date: 2015-09-22 22:22:07
Good luck!
@_date: 2015-09-20 18:51:37
Yes of course :).
@_date: 2015-09-05 17:39:02
Didn't that work out for him though? Eminem also said he was gay... in a movie.
@_date: 2015-09-01 02:28:24
Why does it seem like the three letter agencies are filled with selfish people with no scruples.
@_date: 2015-09-04 08:29:03
Bravo. Bravo.
@_date: 2015-09-22 22:24:09
First China's, then America's, and now the UK's. Go Bitcoin!
@_date: 2015-09-21 22:07:52
A cryptocurrency hedge, as some call it.
@_date: 2015-09-06 22:20:07
The bitcoin wiki has pretty good info on those things. For specific questions, like about institutional presence (something the wiki might not have), you should save up your questions and ask them all on Mentor Mondays here in the bitcoin subreddit :).
@_date: 2015-09-17 20:02:36
Using the Bitcoin's blockchain technology.
@_date: 2015-09-23 01:44:09
Unfortunately that is the issue with reddit :(.
@_date: 2015-09-22 22:19:57
Let's go with you are a robot :).
@_date: 2015-09-15 16:16:18
I wanna hear slush speak!
@_date: 2015-09-21 22:08:21
You still can :).
@_date: 2015-09-01 02:38:12
I wish the original OP would tell us more about his configuration. Router, modem, cable box, are sometimes referred to as the wrong thing even by customer service.
@_date: 2015-09-04 07:50:47
Small blocks aren't the original vision of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-09-18 18:44:08
The country that doesn't do any of these hoops and lets Bitcoin companies grow as they should will benefit greatly.
@_date: 2015-09-23 18:10:27
Good luck and have fun!
@_date: 2015-09-11 01:22:01
Good thinking, mr tank!
@_date: 2015-09-05 17:40:33
UPS or DHL needs to jump on it then.
@_date: 2015-09-11 17:43:50
How many unique addresses have been created? Let's just quote that number...
@_date: 2015-09-05 00:59:47
2 day delay for a transaction sent without a fee and 50mb size in his mempool.
@_date: 2015-09-17 20:12:57
So many people called it... so many more people willfully ignored it. Just like the last 54 times.
@_date: 2015-09-12 02:25:14
Or use a Bitcoin debit card that has multisig so you don't have to trust the service...
@_date: 2015-09-15 16:19:23
A master of Bitcoin, he is.

AMA request: first redditor with their case.
@_date: 2015-09-12 02:16:07
Nice! Telegram bots are the new rage it seems.
@_date: 2015-09-08 17:28:55
Congratulations. You guys are doing great work! A few white hairs are worth it. Buy some vapes with bitcoin and quit that smoking, though :).
@_date: 2015-09-08 17:27:38
Their crystal balls just don't work that way, apparently. They have refused to recognize that technology is at a new height and that bitcoin is a manifestation of that.
@_date: 2015-09-11 02:31:26
This and the bloomberg cover... very nice!
@_date: 2015-09-10 23:50:15
Good times and that action was very indicative of the general Bitcoin understanding at the time.
@_date: 2015-09-17 20:03:23
Good luck with the mainstream move!
@_date: 2015-09-17 17:48:09
Thank you, Mr. Garzik!
@_date: 2015-09-05 17:39:40
Cool service!

Tell them to prep the carriage and horses!
@_date: 2015-09-08 07:18:09
The advice you will get here is: "don't."
@_date: 2015-09-08 07:11:07
So...  Bitcoin killer app incoming?
@_date: 2015-09-18 18:43:22
In the United States only... technically.
@_date: 2015-09-22 01:56:52
Keep reading! Soon you will be old to this.
@_date: 2015-09-21 22:05:30
HD wallet i imagine.
@_date: 2015-09-17 17:50:39
Being able to be truly international jives perfectly with the entrepreneurial spirit. Bitcoin does that in spades :).
@_date: 2015-09-01 16:39:51
I know the subreddit decided that the design was less than optimal.. but why is bitcoin.com considered a "shitty" source? Have you read the authors other stuff?
@_date: 2015-09-12 07:51:40
This is how we unchain ourselves from legacy banking :).
@_date: 2015-09-02 18:38:31
Too busy getting on or off the bandwagon.
@_date: 2015-09-02 18:37:43
Graphs make things easier to understand... but there is still more to this debate.
@_date: 2015-09-18 19:23:22
I had to reinstall xp recently...
@_date: 2015-09-05 20:36:21
You can still apply for jobs!
@_date: 2015-09-22 22:22:34
Because why not?
@_date: 2015-09-22 00:15:36
Congrats to Anthem!

@_date: 2015-09-11 20:06:04
Good luck!

Oh the irony.
@_date: 2015-09-04 08:29:03
Bravo. Bravo.

How many kids will get to take the course?

Go storj!
@_date: 2015-11-17 09:51:15
Grooober, thanks for your insights! Our goal is to outline the basics of the discussion in simple terms for new and less technical users, in an effort to help everyone to understand why is it important.
@_date: 2015-09-18 19:21:51
You most certainly can. You can do it on an snes, by hand, etc. And that is all with Bitcoin's hard pow.
@_date: 2015-10-16 13:14:13
Let's put together a list of the best Bitcoin songs :)
@_date: 2015-10-16 13:13:16
Hope you like the updated list!
@_date: 2015-03-20 15:10:23
Title is misleading. They are talking about traditional banks mainly. And looks like the head of Ukraine Security Service is not really aware how bitcoin works.
@_date: 2016-05-29 13:58:12
You're right, Damnshiok. We'll add it. Thanks.

Hi everyone, we have been made aware of a user who is posting in different groups alleging his funds were stolen. That is false and the funds are where they should be, in the wallet. 
In line with article 25 of HolyTransaction's T&amp;Cs, the company has the right to suspend the user access to the services if the user is in violation of any provision laid down by the T&amp;Cs. Our customer support is in contact with the user.   
While we cannot discuss individual cases, we would like to highlight to everyone who is reading this that HolyTransaction has been successfully in business since 2014 being the first multicurrency web wallet to be launched. Thanks for reading.
