Spending could very well be (and in my opinion should be) in the form of investing. A demurrage currency suggests that people will pay a fee for cold stored cash (or crypto) but not for their assets that are invested into growth and creat jobs etc'...

Now that's just semantics.. If it's still not clear I refer to hoarding as a problematic thing IMO, any other form of monetary circulation should be incentivized. And regardless, I am not against spending; people should by as much stuff as they want. I was nearly pointing out that the current system manipulates consumers to spend more than they need (and mostly resulting in people spending more than they have) for the benefit of the those who actually control fiat money and gain from the consumers debt.

Awesome reply, Thanks! Would you say that concepts like Colored Coins will be enabling that sort of liability structure on top of Bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-01-09 00:20:31
very valid point.. thanks

Does anyone know if there is anyway to make instant buys on Coinbase? last time I bought during the rise 2.5 months ago, when the price was $430 p/BTC and received it only 5 days later for $790 p/BTC, even though I had connected my bank account to my Coinbase account.  
Is there anyway to buy and receive bitcoins the same day on Coinbase?
Unfortunately they are not responding to my emails...

I agree that would be the responsible thing to do.. Vote up ppl!

What about making it an [Ethereom DAO]( that is publicly available for anyone to monitor and all foundation member keys are publicly known. That could be a huge first step.. 
@_date: 2014-03-04 15:30:30
[Ethereum]( are proposing a foundation layer to run decentralized contracts, which should allow any decent level programmer to securely create a decentralized service (such as a decentralized exchange) - Their approach is interesting IMO since they have been involved in multiple "crypto2.0" endeavors, learnt a lot on what the chalenges are and seem to employ a dream team of developers and cryptographers and most importantly - are NOT rushing to launch but instead opening up their efforts for all to bring it to a stable and secure enough state pre-launch...

Content sites should really pick up on this.. the possibilities of micro-payments as a tipping mechanism for favorable content could really get the artists/content creators using their services an incentive to push there content (and inherently the hosting site) much stronger..

I was referring to the demurrage concept, where every participant in the economy has to pay a fixed fee for hoarding money. Without it, keeping money out of circulation in hopes that it's value would rise in the future is easier to those who have a lot accumulated because they can afford that risk more than others, allowing them to accumulate more etc'.. creating ever-growing disequality 
@_date: 2014-02-06 15:31:53
Yeah.. Agreed and understood. But still, it shows the growing frustration and the ridiculous attitude from Apple leading to it, so I think it can make for an interesting item that might shed some light to folks outside this subreddit.

So the BTC network is scalable, but the implementation will be determined as we go and will need to be voted on or accepted by &gt;50% of the nodes? (disregarding alt coins in this regard) 
@_date: 2014-02-10 11:10:52
It is a specific problem to Mt. Gox (and might be for other services, if they took shortcuts in their IT infrastructure). Since they chose to implement a derivative of the core client by making modifications to the verification process on top the core technology they made this glitch possible. 
As explained in [this article]( quoting Andreas Antonopoulos:

I think the more serious issue is banning mining gear (high end GPUs and specialized ASIC machines..) What effect do you reckon this might have on mining in China/worldwide? 
@_date: 2014-02-24 08:49:05
Good on you mate. It is our responsibility to keep presenting things as they are clean from emotional reactions. People must understand that WE are the regulators and it is our responsibility to keep each other informed and most importantly vote with your wallets and to not be tempted over and over by the same tricks.

thanks.. lets see where this mess ends up :/ I sure am glad I got frustrated with their service early on and moved to Coinbase...
@_date: 2014-01-12 10:19:34
what about deceptive mining pools that actually have control over the miner's gear? like p2pool.org which allows newbies to make a quick buck, without them realizing they are giving all their hashing power to a central body? Isn't that a credible threat?
@_date: 2014-02-10 12:45:46
This shouldn't be a matter of for or against Gox at all.. this is an issue of transparency and clarification that there is no "new critical flaw found in the bitcoin protocol" as the press release may lead readers to believe. 
Keeping things in proportion and making sure the BTC ecosystem is transparent, is of utmost importance and should (if not yet) be one of the top priorities of the Bitcoin Foundation IMO..

It is a (decentralized) digital payment system.
That's all it is. An open source protocol.
As an inherent part of the system it has quantifiable units that can be transferred almost for free - those units can be considered as a currency. 
I think that is more accurate.
@_date: 2013-12-20 18:41:39
I agree its hard to swallow for the mainstream user. That's why I usually avoid the term 'decentralized'. The point I was trying to make, is that rather than explaining it is a currency (which always provokes questions such as - backed by whom? who controls it? how does it come into being, etc'...), I just tell my friends and family it is a payment system, just like Paypal, or visa. Just that it's public and way more efficient; thus making any payment simpler, faster and cheaper than any solution today... I think people can grasp that much easier than a new form of currency, whether it be digital, virtual or magical... but indeed we have a long way to go in public education and acceptance. 
BTW - I believe merchants will be much more excited to hear about a "cheaper faster way to charge for goods/services" than to hear about a "digital currency" - and merchants are the key to make this a very REAL digital currency.

Thanks for the reply, the fundamental difference to the Chonese USD reserve is the fact that China's economy is dependent on the strength of the USD.
In contrary to bitcoinn, where an owner of this wallet - 
For example, could trade it into a whoping $0.5 Billion - rendering Bitcoin much less valuable by lowering confidence and exposing a "flaud" to the world, while his 500 million dollars are not affected at all by the BTc collapse..
I guess that while it will hurt the Bitcoin economy, half a billion dollars could be an incentive for someone to do such a thing
