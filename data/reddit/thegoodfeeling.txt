Have you looked at the divorce rates tho? and the percentage of women that divorce? Anyhow, gl to OP. I hope it works out for them!

So flip of a coin is a pretty good chance? mmmm not for me, sorry. I'm assuming you haven't married yet, but hey, neither have I, and it just doesn't sound promising. I'd rather just be with the person without feeling like you need a big ring and wedding to show that you two love each other. There was a study that found the more expensive and extravagant the wedding was, the more likely the marriage ended in divorce. Quite interesting. I do agree with you on some of the MGTOW and redpill guys being a bit overboard, but not all of them are like that. You seem to just bash people in that community without any knowledge or empathy of what they've gone through. Anyways, no hard feelings, just giving my opinion on the matter.

Ya, it's scary out there nowadays. We gotta put on those red tinted shades to protect us.

Ya, I made sure to do my research! haha. The guy was even recommending we do that and exchange ID's too. It sounds legit for sure.

I'm about to buy a festival ticket and going to pay the seller through paypal using the "goods and services". That way I can reverse it if something goes wrong. The family and friends makes it so you dont pay fees but you have no refund for anything that goes wrong.

ya, I totally get that. these tickets are 140 and in the state next to me where I’m going to for the festival, so gotta be extra careful. I’ve been scammed once online and once irl. Can’t let that happen again.
