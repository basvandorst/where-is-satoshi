Definitely not. Clearly I'm way too naive about the all aspects of the situation to even properly ask my question or understand an answer. This post mainly stemmed from curiosity

I'm on a cell phone 1000 miles away from home using wifi that I don't pay for

This post does have to do with bitcoin. Sure, someone requested my assistance with something that may or may not be legal, which is what sparked my curiosity. My post is about whether or not receiving BTC and converting it to cash is 100% traceable under all circumstances

That's not a bad idea man. Could you tell me anything about BTC? Whether or not it can be cleaned? Or how you convert it to cash? Do you have to sell them to somebody or is it like an exchange?
@_date: 2017-10-12 19:48:32
Yeah it definitely does. My question is though, can that be proven? If he cleans them and sends them to me and I hand him cash in person, is it possible for me to get caught? If so, how?

Thanks, this is perfect

Yeah I have very limited knowledge on BTC but I do know it's an open ledger. The guy told me he can "clean" them though, and that my job is just to receive what's already been laundered... idk. I'm not gonna do it, but you're right I should post this in r/Monero. I would have if I knew what the fuck a monero is

I didn't do anything, I simply asked a question. calm yourself

He's been my plug for a long time. A good one too
@_date: 2017-10-12 19:50:09
My question is whether or not it's safe/if/how I could be caught doing this. Could it be proven? My question isn't whether or not it's a crime
@_date: 2017-10-12 19:37:06
Well, according to him all I'm doing is receiving bitcoins, and converting them to cash.... that's money laundering, it's it?
@_date: 2017-10-12 22:39:27
Thanks for the info. Definitely not doing it
@_date: 2017-10-12 20:19:13
Honestly I'm 99% sure I'm not ever going to do it. I figured maybe someone on here who knows about bitcoin could give me a concrete reason as to why this is a horrible idea, so I could use it as a reason not to when talking to the guy

The way he made it sound on the phone was that I take cash out of my bank account (that isn't mine), and give it to him for a cut. Free, easy money. Too good to be true. Like I said, I was 99.9% sure I wasn't ever going to take him up on the offer, but after the feedback I've gotten here, I'm 100% not going to
