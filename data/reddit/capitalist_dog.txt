Hanlon's Razor: Do not attribute to malice that which can be explained by incompetence.
The good news is, the incompetence is so glaring the next goxxing won't be a surprise except to the uninitiated.

This is part of the cycle and a right of passage for newcomers to cryptocurrency. You can't truly understand the hodl mentality until you've been burned by a shitcoin of the month.

Being first turned into being the biggest, being the biggest inherently makes it the most secure, being the most secure makes it the most valuable, being the most valuable makes the network even bigger... the cycle continues.

It's a good thing, anyone who says otherwise either wants Bitcoin to die on the vine or doesn't understand how these products work.
In order for Bitcoin to continue growing, it requires mainstream adoption. In order for that to happen, businesses need to offer services around that. These financial instruments allow businesses incorporated in fiat to serve Bitcoin customers without currency risk.
Furthermore, if Bitcoin is the future of money, the masses need a means of accessing it. This widens the funnel allowing fiat to be devalued in favor of Bitcoin.
The FUD around naked shorts suppressing the price are baseless and idiotic claims put out by gold bugs who've been proven wrong and are clinging to conspiracy theories. Even if it were true, that would be a two-way street with long positions driving up the price, as has historically been the case with new futures products providing an onramp for capital. 
20k no later than April, but probably by January. 40k some point in 2018.

A token for every use case is no different than shares for every company.
Projects will come of tokens and stand-alone blockchains where a product or service is offered denominated in those tokens, with granddaddy Bitcoin being the true money and those tokens being gift cards.
@_date: 2017-12-02 22:13:54
It's the chain other chains will settle on and from which their exchange rates will be derived. Just as stocks on the new york stock exchange are settled in dollars, and your credit card is settled in dollars, paypal/venmo use dollars, tokens and payment channels will settle on Bitcoin- not dollars.
With the future being blockchain technology, the biggest and most secure will be the common denominator tying them all together. 
In the future, when you buy a product or service, you may not even know you're using bitcoin... and you wont really be using dollars. You'll be using a token who's value is denominated in bitcoin. Instead of Netflix whacking your card every month in fiat, you'll have Netflixcoin that will be paid for instantly and atomically with Bitcoin. Netflixcoin will be the equivalent of Netflix shares on the stock exchange today.

That's not how the internet works. Coinbase is neither a network or a protocol, so they can't specifically target it.
They could limit the networks Coinbase uses, but that would effect a hell of a lot more than Coinbase and thus be untenable for them.
The net neutrality shit is FUD put out by companies like Netflix and Reddit who don't want to pay for bandwidth.

This is a short-sighted business decision, and short-sighted businesses always lose out to forward thinking/innovative businesses over time. 
Unfortunate.

It'll only be after it has become the core of all finance, the actors are probably just now children.
Most importantly, it'll be crowdfunded on a blockchain, and no one will not think twice about paying in crypto to see it.

Lots of goods packed into this release, excited to test the improved performance!
Thanks to all who've contributed!

Government is the only monopoly at play, and that's who you're supporting if you're fighting for net neutrality.
Millions of americans are fighting it because astroturf told them to, it's a political campaign, no one fighting it is a network engineer that actually knows WTF they're talking about.

Quite the contrary, money in and of itself is a social network. A social context is key to Bitcoin adoption as it allows a way native to most users to masquerade the technical elements.
I'm soliciting support for this project:

Square has, or will soon have, direct deposit purchases. So, you could simply have a portion of your paycheck direct deposited to that address.
There are also invoicing services if you 1099, which is better for tax purposes anyway.

Channel sizes &gt;.16 BTC
There is/was a cap on channel sizes in these early days to minimize risk of heavy losses from a glitch. Now that the implementations are largely stable, this is being phased out.

You don't need a full map, you just need directions to the next set of directions.
You don't reach out to Verizon, you reach out to Comcast, Comcast reaches out to Verizon, Verizon reaches out to the next logical router in that network, and so on. 
A node is just a router that talks to other routers. 
It's a mesh, whether that looks like a hub or not is irrelevant. Some people engage in more economic activity then others, by default they are hubs of commerce and present while still being p2p.

A better internet analogy would be, you're on comcasts network but need to reach another user on the verizon network. Comcast routes to Verizon... then Verizon routes you to their user and vice versa.
Think of nodes like subnets.

It's a demo from Alex Bosworth. 
Most wallets being developed are being done in Javascript and therefore can be used like a webwallet. His is basically a proof of concept, not sure if he has bigger plans.
Lightning Desktop, Shock, and Zap among the wallets being developed in Javascript.
@_date: 2018-03-20 21:03:55
It'll be cross-platform, JavaScript leveraging Cordova. 
It's called Shock,  | 
@_date: 2018-03-14 19:17:30
Everything is still in testing, i'm not sure what stage the binaries are at regarding those features. As of now, there are so few peers and no working autopilot, it wouldn't work even it if it was implemented.
Node specification within a URI is practical for the moment, no different than an email needing to know which MX to go to.

We should have a usable beta in a few weeks. Back-end 50% complete, front-end sneak peak:

Short answer, no.

It's a network as in people, not stake of control, you can do whatever you like with your node and it doesn't matter a bit to anyone else. If you don't cooperate, you don't get peers, it's that simple.
You can have as many channels as you please, no need to ever rely on a cartel of peers. 
@_date: 2018-04-16 23:53:53
A bank infers a custodian, but your larger premise I agree with.
I'm with Shock, and we're creating a mobile lightning wallet that puts functionality in a social context to attract new users and provide an experience they're already accustom too.
We've already employed a UX/UI engineer but would welcome your additional input if you'd like to drop by shocknet.public on KeyBase. 
@_date: 2018-07-06 03:49:19
Not everyone will need to open a channel to you, but you will need some channels opened to you with remote balances for others to route through.
Set up a minimum channel size that represents a reasonable minimum capacity as it relates to closing vs. fee, then request inbound connections here, on the implementation slack channels, cryptotwitter, wherever to create that inbound capacity and not have to worry about losing money during fee spikes for closing frivolous channels.
@_date: 2018-04-30 22:27:58
Or you could support the countless development projects that are working to spread adoption cases.
