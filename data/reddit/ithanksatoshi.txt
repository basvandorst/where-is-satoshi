Does this change anything from a user perspective? Transactions still confirm the same way every 10 minutes on average? Or can you get a softblock confirmation and somehow get some certainty already?

Does high performance not bring high security? 
Best network effect -&gt; best miners reward -&gt; best security
@_date: 2015-05-12 19:04:32
Fantastic, thank you so much !
@_date: 2017-02-27 12:39:56
I want fees to stay lower (or equal) to the fees of competition. If not, the competetion will get better security in the end. 
@_date: 2017-03-04 21:40:57


You can moderate those. No problem, just make sure you open up your mod-logs.
@_date: 2017-03-06 16:54:37
But we want a HF block size increase, just as proof that the code in your brain is flexible enough to provide more of it in the future. Thats the gist of this all..
@_date: 2016-03-12 13:33:40
It could be very low. Then you could ask the question why is it very low? Maybe because bitcoin has not enough network effect to support a growing transaction volume? I know I have stopped pursueding friends and relatives to buy and use bitcoin for a while now.
@_date: 2017-03-15 20:57:16
With Larger blocks they would earn far less shortterm since the fees would go down. Mining is a thin margin game anyway that self adjusts. Miners want the protocol to correct to its original state with extra capacity so they can stay in bussiness with bitcoin longterm and don't need to swith to an other coin.
@_date: 2017-03-16 08:38:31


You cannot stay immutable if your miners leave you, and they will if the competition eats your lunch. Als nobody wants zero fees, but competitive fees.
@_date: 2017-03-04 21:45:09
I have never understood why entities like core and blockstream never used their own forum or subredit as their main communication channel.
@_date: 2017-03-03 18:03:02
Bitcoin has not been a decentralised system for 6 years? interesting!
@_date: 2017-03-06 19:57:43
If the HF comes from core there will be nothing controversial about it. Also $echochamber != "whole community"

Here you can find more about the timeframe: 
@_date: 2017-03-04 13:50:37
We have reached steady state? By what definition? I still regard the system very much in start-up phase since the threads are not so much government or VISA like entities but above all competing coins. The unique selling point of having the best hash-protected system is not self-evident. It is a property that needs continuous protection and monitoring and can only stay strong if you are more usefull then the others in the level playing field.
@_date: 2017-03-14 18:03:03
Miners profit is limited no matter if the total fees are low or high, its a self adjusting market with thin margins. If I was a miner I would however, with a new round of harware investing on the horizon, study very carefully if I needed to 
 a: switch to maybe a new coin 
 b: start mining with a new client (keep the coin competitive) 
 c: go with segwit, hope lightning will deliver in time
@_date: 2017-03-04 21:42:14
He cannot say obviously..
@_date: 2017-03-03 18:29:42
Up untill the backlogs started the miners could determine the blocksize since the limit was far above demand. I never heard anybody complaining that miners had too much power or that the system was too centralised because of it.
@_date: 2017-03-14 17:38:22
Or maybe they care just as much, or even more (since their bussiness depends on it), about bitcoin, and think that the constant backlog is hurting the usabilty and thus the competiveness.
@_date: 2017-03-14 17:47:51
It is? Can you maybe commit a fix? I am sure the miners would be really grateful, since like I mentioned, their bussiness depends on it.
@_date: 2017-03-18 17:04:49
Yes, and thats the reason bitcoins main selling point of being immutable is hogwash. You need to outpace the competing coins in haspower to stay immutable. The only way to do this is riding the fine line between staying decentralized and allowing enough growth on the main chain. Also a little good PR from all participants does not hurt. The bitcoin ecosystem is doing terrible on that aspect right now.
@_date: 2017-03-18 14:21:21
It's a good graph, I think both sides could get behind it.
@_date: 2016-06-06 09:51:10
Thanks for this important distinction between importing and sweeping. I didn't know. Here you can find more info on the topic: 
@_date: 2016-06-22 13:52:05
Was there any inspiration from other teams involved here that got things rolling quickly here? 
@_date: 2016-06-10 12:59:05


How can anyone be sure it will always stay that way? You assume here that unproven features like lightning give more utilty than proven features like pure p2p cash.
@_date: 2016-06-18 10:27:32
Yes i agree too, we should be very carefull changing the amount of extra space available in a block.
@_date: 2017-01-02 13:25:42
When will we run out of zeros to add in front? 
Okay, never probably, still would like to see some in detail explanation on it.
@_date: 2016-06-04 13:17:10
Answer to the second question is just as interesting: "That does not happen for a 132 years, and as far as I know in a 132 years will be looking at a bitcoin interplanetairy network and I am less worried about how we optimise the blockchain today to achieve that"
@_date: 2017-01-02 13:55:18
@_date: 2016-11-05 10:44:16
There is a coin that has incentives for running a node. They will probably never have to worry about (node)decentralisation and therefore don't need to deal with big block fear mongering that one sometimes witness at other coins.
@_date: 2016-11-05 11:03:18
So we are all glad there are teams out there developing clients and such as long as we don't talk about it to explicitly?
@_date: 2016-11-05 13:05:46
Wow, could you explain yourself in a more cryptic manner. I had to read it twice. But if I understand you correctly is that not exactly the same risk/mechanism for miners?
@_date: 2016-11-05 11:46:26
So what can the monetary bribary acomplish, can you give an example? I mean a node is just validating and passing transactions, bribing just one node wouldn't cut it.
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:41:13
So there goes your unique selling point as most secure coin. Also before you can use your GPU blocktimes and mempools already have exploded. So sure you can rise from the ashes again but if you had any coins in the chain they have become worthless at record speed.
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:23:50
I would wait approx 6 months until they are worth 10.000 dollar
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:07:47
Well those 'clone-supporters' could also be genuinly concerned about the risk of hanging on the wrong branch. I mean think about it, can your 'original' chain survive an exodus of miners? At some point you need to admit that some FUD is reality and you'd better wake up or risk your own financial health.
@_date: 2017-11-10 12:51:26
So I better switch to Cash for the coming 2-3 years? Thanks for the advise ;-)
@_date: 2017-11-05 22:40:07
Is a full mempool contagious from nodes to humans? This is getting more absurd by the hour.
@_date: 2017-11-09 18:23:53
When the blockchain software was born (2008/2009) the M1 figure for global money supply was roughly 2.1 trillion USD. So if a certain cryptocurrency is, as planned, to take over all coins and checking accounts you will get 1 satoshi = 1 dollarcent. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 21:34:23
Its not a 51% atack if +80% of the miners and multiple exchanges support it. Upgrade would be a better description.
@_date: 2017-11-11 09:43:06
You consider 2-3 year short term? It think its a pretty long period in cryptoland. Also don't forget that hashing power follows price, if Cash eats significant hashing power in a 2 weeks period the honey badger with the short tail does not survive.
@_date: 2017-11-05 21:43:13
What do you mean by virtually no one? I know a lot of people that want this upgrade very much.

His talks become more and more incoherent  i must say
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:20:39
But they will not actually sell or buy I hope? I mean they will wait for Lightning I assume?

In 2030 mining reward will be 1,5625 btc = 781250 dollar, hmm better make sure we give them enough fees /s
@_date: 2016-02-29 23:18:44
Bitcoin has always been overpriced due to future promise of utility and adoption through a market force called speculation. If you take away those  promises speculators will be forced to find other markets. Pricerice will be slowed down.

Metcalfe's law? I thought that theory is considered flawed around here?
@_date: 2015-09-21 12:36:17
This guy is not even suggesting that some other coin will take over. He actually suggests "the blockchain" will evolve on its own without bitcoin. Clueless to the max.
@_date: 2016-10-10 12:52:57
Unlimited is not about a 2MB cap, the miner set its own limit using a special algorithm called common sense.
@_date: 2016-10-23 13:15:04


They want to block it for now as they don want it to be the **only** scaling option

My onine food ordering service uses 0-conf luckily. Usually I am pretty hungry so I really don't want my food to show up an extra 10 minutes later. But since they have my address and all I guess they will keep accepting 0conf.

We do know by now however that if anybody was to come forward he/she or they will be met with high sceptisism or utter contempt.
@_date: 2015-11-10 23:09:33
Bingo, bitcoin can only work as a settlement system when there is minimal volatility. This can only be achieved if adoption is big enough. Which in turn can only be achieved with..well..you know..

Regarding the vimeo:
"We have recovered tens of thousends of private keys in bitcoin, at my university" This interviewers is making some weird claimes about being able to get private keys from bitcoin transactions. I would get angry too if someone was throwing such bullshit at my invention.

You should never trust anybody. Inspect the code and see if the proposed logic will tick all or most of the boxes you are looking for.
