Thank you for the explanation. 
I love the way the PoS coin Vericoin is chekpointed every minute with an auxiliary PoW chain, Verium.

The funny thing is that he still says Amazon will accept Bitcoin except in his video when he's about to say the date, the voice changes a lot as if he would have recorded the new date in different sound conditions at a later date. I'm thinking of paying it so that I can ride a new tiger.

You needed 200 escudos in 1999 to buy what 0.02 Escudos bought in 1989.
The Escudo lost 10,000 times its value in 10 years.
That’s a 100,000 % inflation on a yearly basis.
Tell me that’s not hyperinflation.

Banks lend out money for profit. It’s a social institution and very healthy for society, they arbitrage between savings and investing. Amazing read

Start by understanding the field you are wanting to enter.
@_date: 2018-07-02 14:26:11
If  you have a 70k car you better have a spare couple hundred thousand to through at Bitcoin so don't need to actually sell the car for BTC. I don't care about your finances, I'm commenting on the part you disclosed.
@_date: 2018-07-07 12:30:17
That's because it's out of your scope. They are humans doing relatively regular stuff: C++ isn't magic, maths aren't magic and most of the stuff are just implementations of old ideas such as Schnorr signatures, a very old idea created by someone in the past like pretty much all the maths that run the Internet (Fourier's maths for example).
Don't deify people.
@_date: 2018-07-12 01:44:22
He’s lying 
@_date: 2018-07-02 14:50:39
I can't see how you are loaded and want to sell the car to invest into something but whatever. 
@_date: 2018-07-05 18:03:34

Bear market ahead, so much stupids like your around.
@_date: 2018-07-02 13:29:03
So you have to sell a 70k car to buy Bitcoin. You need to learn how to control money, really.
@_date: 2018-07-11 23:34:10
At that time it was as simple as mining them at home... it was easier that preparing a bowl of popcorn.

@_date: 2018-07-08 08:46:08
I was referring to the signatures, he did not invent anything nonetheless Segwit is not an invention, it’s altering the txs by removing the signatures. Only idiots like you idolize regular people. Your God is creating God’s money (when in fact he’s a greedy pig destroying it)
@_date: 2018-07-26 08:51:37
That’s because they own the brand name which prevails over the domain name so your are not entitled to that property. Nonetheless I could sell hotels under Microsoft.org

And tax credit. But it’s not investing it’s an expense with no financial return.

@_date: 2018-04-09 13:37:32
Bitcoin Cash can implement second layers too as it has flexible transactions instead of Segwit... and with cheaper fees to open a channel. But even with BCH at $1,000,000 the second layer adds little value as practically nobody needs to send 1 cent.
@_date: 2018-04-25 12:24:38
I'm not sure exactly who you are but it doesn't really mater. Here is a blog post from Gavin who coded hand and hand with Satoshi: 
Non of your two facts really argues Bitcoin was meant to increase the block size from day one:


The fact that BCH nodes are not compatible with Satoshi's nodes does not mean Bitcoin was not meant to increase the block size.


The fact that Bitcoin Core's nodes are backwards compatible with Satoshi's nodes does not mean Bitcoin wasn't meant to increase the block size.
Your arguments add simply nothing to my statement.
Your last fact is not a fact, is a conclusion from the previous two arguments that do not argue the initial statement. So its not a valid conclusion.
@_date: 2018-04-25 00:18:05
Bitcoin was meant to increase the block size so you can’t call BCH an alt-coin.
@_date: 2018-04-25 22:50:37
A quote from here   just joking
@_date: 2018-04-25 13:18:40


Read my initial comment please 


Bitcoin doesn't need anyone to welcome me. 
@_date: 2018-04-08 21:50:41
There is no trademark so no.
@_date: 2018-04-22 13:13:15
I hope you bought a decent amount of Gold. Just to give you a clear broad picture, reading directly from Bitcoin's github repo: "[Bitcoin is an experimental digital currency]( so people building this stuff are already warning you.
Don't get me wrong fiat is a scam but you know... cryptocurrencies are very experimental and a big speculation so don't use it to guarantee the future your wealth if that's what you are looking for.
Bitcoin will hit 500k$ and my words will sound stupid, I know. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 18:39:21
This is why taxes are important.
@_date: 2018-04-26 15:06:09
You logic is very misleading.
I'm not interested in collectivism. Clearly you don't have consensus as many users use BCH so, the consensus you envision does not exist. 
Read the Satoshi's emails, Bitcoin was meant to increase the block-size 
You call BCH centralised for having centralised planers as if BTC didn't have a bunch of programers deciding. But there is something that will be more clear to see over time: programers don't matter. Miners make the rules, users accept them or not.
There are a ton of Bitcoin enthusiasts from the early days now on BCH. I've been around BTC since late 2012 and I see many the exact same people now on BCH.
@_date: 2018-04-19 08:24:57
Buy BCH
@_date: 2018-04-25 13:05:44
Yes but that’s not the block size increase, you are speaking about the lightning network. My argument is that it’s not legit to call BCH an alt-coin, as it’s not.
@_date: 2018-04-25 22:34:10
yeah... 
@_date: 2018-04-18 04:14:19
You are right but there are legit competitors.
