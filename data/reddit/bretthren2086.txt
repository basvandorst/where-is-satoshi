I used Poli and BPay to transfer to my coinjar. I think as long as the credit card is in your name you should be safe.

Money and power does corrupt. Greed is a powerful motivator.

I believe for purchases under $1000 you don't pay taxes. The government already gets your money from gst. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 02:17:05
I would guess so. I'm not sure. All I read is purchases under $1000 are not a taxable event. So maybe cash counts. Since you are technically purchasing a different currency.

Have you tried to contact their support team? They take a while to respond but this seems like a high priority ticket.

For some perspective most websites are larger than the original doom game. 
I remember downloading pirated mp3's and it would take an hour. Well only an hour if I didn't lose the connection. Because of that happened I had to try again! For one song! 
@_date: 2018-01-22 11:36:40
The network is growing with lightning. It will be much more useable day to day soon. I'm in Australia and use coinjar which allows me to BPay bills and I also have rechargeable debit card with them for fiat purchases. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 10:56:39
Wow that got dark.

That shit must get you so high!

Well I did start with a 56k modem. Guess I was late to the party haha. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 08:28:41
Except what? 
@_date: 2018-01-01 04:14:36
Why doesn't the US introduce a system like Australia has where you don't pay capital gains on purchases under $1000.00 using bitcoin. This would simplify the tax rules for everyone and mean less red tape. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 16:16:56
Lol those price predictions! 
@_date: 2018-01-11 13:14:18
I sold too! All my Btrash and bought the dip!
@_date: 2018-01-22 11:02:05
Unless of course there is a whole crypto correction. Then all coins fall. So maybe diversify out of crypto if you are risk averse. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:32:35
Because crypto kitties didn't screw up ethereums traffic. Hahahaha

Wayne Gretzky said that. Though that's hockey sorry. We had it painted on a mural at work so I may be wrong though.
@_date: 2018-05-08 14:01:14
I think this is what will ultimately drive adoption. 
@_date: 2018-05-23 14:17:54
Wow an exchange on the Internet that was polite. Well done.

And the vendor didn't have to pay any fees to receive your money. 
@_date: 2018-05-27 06:15:18
Yep. It's talking about common misconceptions and using that as an example. As well as "if you ask an undercover policeman if he's a policeman he has to tell you".
@_date: 2018-05-05 12:29:22
It's the rim job eh
@_date: 2018-05-08 14:03:50
That does seem to be the next step.
@_date: 2018-05-31 13:20:39
Like the good ol Californian gold rush eh.
@_date: 2018-06-09 05:58:15
Yep I've been startled by just how low the volume is on the exchanges. It does keep getting pushed up every time it drops though.
@_date: 2018-03-29 11:06:14
@_date: 2018-03-30 00:00:58
This same kind of dip happens before every major holiday. People don't trust bitcoin so they convert it to fiat before the holiday then we have an upsurge after.
@_date: 2018-02-17 14:27:11
I haven't been to mainland USA yet. I'm only comparing service to my experience in Hawaii as a tourist. I found people there to be very friendly and welcoming. 
I may be biased though as I spent ten years working in bars and restaurants and see bad service based on my personal standards. 
@_date: 2018-02-17 11:07:56
I agree. The level of service you receive in the states exceeds what you get here in Aus. I would tip if people in Australia were as professional and courteous.
@_date: 2018-03-29 23:58:22
Especially as businesses realise the benefit of not paying a percentage of the price to visa or MasterCard.

Not to mention people who used leveraged investing. They would have to be able to cover the losses on their portfolio.
@_date: 2018-02-21 01:50:37
Constructive. Thank you 
@_date: 2018-02-20 23:36:46
Thanks peoples! I have already said most of this to him and get snarky responses. You can lead a horse to water but you can't make it drink I guess. But you can drown the horse in denial when shitcoins go pop! 
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:12:50
Bitcoin wasn't lost or stolen by the bitcoin corporation. Stolen bitcoins are your responsibility. Keep it secret, keep it safe!

Cool sorry for the great offence I have caused. I was repeating what I had read in the past. 
I haven't been diagnosed with any disorders but since you have now called me an idiot and a retard I may need to seek help. Thank you for the clarity of your responses. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 09:58:40
Thanks. That's what I thought happened.

This stuff is great! I fully expect crypto mining to drive investment and advancements in green energy.
Look at what is happening with computer tech now with ASIC chips getting  produced by Samsung this year.
@_date: 2018-04-14 05:13:20
I look forward to this future, I don't drink and abhor the violence that has become so commonplace with alcohol being blamed. 
Although western societies have already banned alcohol. That's why they have NASCAR in the states lol. 
@_date: 2018-04-06 02:11:17
Just remember last year India made a lot of their currency worthless overnight. This left millions without the little hey had managed to save as they have no fixed address and cannot open a bank account. The paper money was worth literally nothing. The Indian government did this to stamp out corruption and money laundering apparently. 
This is why a trustless currency is needed. No one can take it from you and say it is worthless. 
@_date: 2018-04-14 02:26:39
I agree with the findings that alcohol is damaging however it is also the most widespread and accepted drug. So the stats are heavily weighted that alcohol be more damaging than other drugs

Or you're an older person who didn't grow up on the internet and doesn't have a spidey sense about these things. 
People still get scammed by Nigerian princes you know. 
You're auto correct comment would've been better as "ducking autocorrect"

And the banks were only able to exchange so much per person per day. After a certain day it became worthless.

What's that disclaimer? Past performance is a reliable indicator of future performance? No that doesn't sound right...
@_date: 2018-04-14 05:18:16
Actually what you sent and he reviewed were iou's between the banks which are reconciled at the end of the month. Although yeah as far as the consumer is aware and cares the money was transferred. 
Also which banks were you using? 
@_date: 2018-04-23 15:21:42
The problem with the royal commission in Australia is that a lot of money is tied up in superannuation accounts which have invested in the banks so as the banks are taking a dive so too is the money we are forced to save and generally have to trust someone else to manage for us. 
Huzzah for corruption. Damned if you do damned if you don't and the same people stay on top. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 10:20:50
I got a great deal on a bitcoin one site wanted to rip me off and charge 9k this one only charged 1.5k where do I sell it for 9k? 
I'm sure someone has said that in the wild before.

I've never seen that before. Haha thanks
@_date: 2018-04-12 11:25:20
That's an important distinction. New comers and older people see the bitcoin name and then buy the cheaper option. 
@_date: 2018-04-18 02:31:17
So we should process most transactions off chain and leave bitcoin source code intact? The larger the blocks the more complex the nodes have to be.
@_date: 2018-04-15 09:29:37
Probably! Good investment advice.
@_date: 2018-04-13 11:15:29
