First they need to get cracking because knowing where the coins are and accessing them is a work in progress. If a deal is made, then they have a decision to make and it will not be an easy one. As it sits today, selling BTC back into a market they don't want to exist would be fueling the fire. What would be next?...Selling all the confiscated drugs...hmm

Just avoid Coinbase.

I wouldn't worry about one bit. Not because they have been screwing people left and right(which they have been) but because they are just trying to intimidate you. They will have some putz threaten to take you to court but they are not going to spend a couple thousand to take a chance to recoup those fees.    
They should focus on the class action lawsuit that is coming their way instead of a couple of coins that you were sent by mistake.

Props for an accurate and concise answer.

The cube is a prepackaged device produced from ASICMiner. The box has 3 cards inside and consumes 250 Watts. 
The problem however is that with all the new hardware hitting the market in the next couple of months, it will be next to impossible to recoup more than half of initial investment any these types of machines.

I trade at the following two places. icbet.se and 796.com.
You can't trade on either right at this minute. icbit is limit out today and 796 is down for maintenance. Both these are good choices for long or shorts.

Unlikely you would get your hands on any equipment that would achieve profitability. Plus any equipment that you could get TODAY would not turn a profit in 12 months let alone 4 months. The difficulty curve is too steep.

It's basically supply and demand. "Real" price is defined as the price you pay. So every price is real. With every market there is an ebb and flow.  One one day company X may have better pricing than company Y and another day company Y may have better pricing.  The market is fluid and sets its own price.

I am a little confused by your post. If someone has a patent; spending $20,000 or $200,000 won't make that patent go away. Searching for patent information is not expensive. I assume you mean fees for an Attorney to handle your defense for patent violation. Advice would be easier if more information was available but you probably don't want to do that.

Props for the update!

I trade futures on both ICBIT and 796.com. Just be careful and make sure you know what you are doing. Neither site has sufficient information on their current process. 
Good luck!

Stay clear of Coinbase!
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:30:56
You will still get one BTC;)

Interesting thought. I wonder if they can rename it though. lol

So did my order from 10 days ago.
@_date: 2013-11-16 19:28:45
Maybe in your case. I was not successful. This is after many successful transactions. One of 2 orders was cancelled. One went through and one did not. They were both similar orders out of the same account. In the end they just told me to just submit one again. I am glad you were able to get yours reversed. Personally I would stay away from Coinbase!

I am sure that some people have had a good experience. Personally I bought many coins from them but one day I too received the high risk email declining my order. After emailing support and watching the price run up from $260 to $400 I was told that they were sorry and if I wanted to I could place a new order. 
The problem is they did not secure coins when orders were placed and they figured they would rather penalize the customer than eat the thousands of dollars they lost by not managing their business properly.

If the greater fool scenario still applies, you might get half your money back.
