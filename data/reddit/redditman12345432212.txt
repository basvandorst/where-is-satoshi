Can you have rolling n-of-m bitcoint transactions, where the inputs are being updated over time? I think you need to have all inputs in place before you can make the bitcoin transaction. Otherwise, sendgame would have to keep track of all the inputs and possible refunds.

Are you in the US? Can this be used to buy games outside the US that are region locked, but are known to activate anywhere?

So could make a system that allowed a check box for "exchange:$3.00" that would allow the transaction to take place, only if the recipient (HanumanTheHumane) sends $3.00 and the sender (The_Hox) paid the full game price. This would allow you to send games to anyone for free, for a discount, at cost, or for a premium and you would only have to trust @_date: 2014-12-01 02:04:13
Ya, that sucks, being able to do this on the blockchain would allow decentralized crowed funding.

This is the best. Not just allegations, actual proof that HSBC knowingly laundered money for terrorists and cartels among others. Nope, lets focus on some theoretical threat that isn't even a treat anyways because they could just do what they do now, US dollars.

Can you explain what the Tx/s means? Does that mean only 7 transactions can be made every second in the entire world? Isn't that extremely low?

yup, using the same system, they should also be able to prove exactly what fraction they are lending at. So you can pay for anything from 1:1 to 10:1. The point isn't to ban, it is to know exactly what is being done.

When I clicked on this link, chrome gave me a giant red screen that says "Phishing attack ahead". I'm guessing the reporting worked?

that's not true at all. Give my your private key and we'll see how much ownership the blockchain provides you.

Out of curiosity, do you want the FDA abolished?
@_date: 2015-04-06 13:39:22
I know, I'm just curious to know if OP thinks FDA should be abolished to allow drug companies to self regulate via 'free market'.

I just want to add that this could be the key that many porn sites are looking for. History has shown us that the porn industry is a huge driving force for technology, but one of the problems is that they rely on subscriptions to make money. Having a continuous rolling subscription might finally solve their concerns leading to wider adoption.

New business idea: invest money in local gangs while also buying all the hospitals. Watch as people come into the ERs and rake in all that sweet medicare money.

yup, by this logic all encryption allows someone to 'collect'. This whole post is BS.

Any system still using MD5 deserves to be hacked.
Any new system being developed that does not use this is reatarded:
It is mindnumbingly easy to implement standard hashing protocols when designing a system from scratch. There are dozens of extremely easy tutorials on the internet that allow anyone to follow.
The above test was from a list of md5 not salted passwords:

I use chrome as my default browser, I just have FF installed for random things that don't work on chrome for whatever reason and use it very rarely. This is the FF private browsing results:

actually yes, they pretty much do

I think the idea is that if you want to have one address which is know to be reliable you can. I doubt anyone is trying to monitor every address.
