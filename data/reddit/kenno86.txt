Merchant pays fee to visa and bank, i don't know why merchant would want this as benefit is only for consumer.
Customer may pay for fee, im not sure on the wording in the FAQ section.
There is discreet billing so bank account only shows 'privacy'
Only available in the US
Fiat is fighting back.

subreddit has a good list 
I have used coinjar.com and now use independent reserve because they accept bank deposit which does not cost a fee and 0.5% brokerage fee but i have not compared exchange rates to the others.
I want to start getting into bitsquare.io or find a trusted contact with local bitcoins.

I work with a multinational corp - fckers - and this has been the most persuasive attempt at getting people into bitcoin yet! 
even tho this may not be cheap for india it is for other countries some people are paying 10% to send money to other countries and bitcoin where i live is only around 1% to get into, not sure what the off ramp at the foreign exchanges would be but if its under 9% we have got alot more brothers in the bitcoin community!

Money is for the unconscious, yes i have invested in bitcoin until we break ourselves free from the bondages of the spell of currency.
Currency means energy but money as a currency is a lie and its only in the collective belief that it exists. In reality a chicken is so much more useful than gold. 
Its a pyramid and if you are one rank up the pyramid we think its ok but we are slaves to the masters.
Support permaculture, sharing and gifting economies beautiful people! Because this redistribution of wealth is only temporary.

haha. yeah i get what you are saying but I'm thinking along the lines of BIPs and how we vote to adopt them. So rather than nodes and miners voting we have everyone holding bitcoins voting on issues (or not if they are not interested)*. Also bitcoin seems to have rulers - core and other parties (unlimited), powerful mining conglomerates and wealthy people who can shape the market with bulk bitcoins. If you have a read of the white paper it may expand your mind.
*the problem with mandatory voting is that you will have someone who is an expert at a subject, say this UASF thing and then you have someone like me who has no idea about it BUT my vote has just as much power as the expert, the weighting is wrong and can be easily swayed with 'manufactured consent' (mainstream marketing and opinion).
*also i have no idea how to vote on any BIP, what do i do as a citizen of bitcoin how do i vote on these ideas? to be eligible i need to at least have a decent bandwidth to run a full node.
