I really wish I had some money to buy Bitcoin right now. I think I may sale my Bitcoin Cash and move it into Bitcoin.

If anything, it's fun to watch them fumble the topic around trying to figure out what they know.

Please explain fraudulent? Nothing stated is false or purposely misleading. Look at the chart in the article and compare to the BTC charts for the same timeframe. They are very similar. When the stock market crashes, it will make a BTC market crash look like pennies, which it is. 
Also BTC is so fragile? I sure hope not, though I would buy the dip.

The internet and light in your house are wasteful and inefficient.

The comparison is that global asset prices are really high, BTC is an asset. Equity guys keep saying BTC is a bubble but Equities are the real bubble.

It may be a great reminder in the future of that time you “invested” in that thing called Bitcoin from the twenty-teens!

The issue is not their overloaded system. The problem is there lack of customer support. They received 100 million in investment and still cannot respond effectively to customer questions and problems.

If it’s a large amount it may be worth going the money transfer route.

Bitcoin does split like tulips and I keep getting more. That’s a good thing.

Go to  it has worked well for me. Coinbase hurt me too, could have gotten into BTC around $1,100 but they blocked me for no reason.  Two months later they were like, hey we unlocked your account.

I did that too! Congratulations!

Goldman often says one thing and does another or does what they say they will do when they have already done it. Their goal is to make their numbers, often by manipulating the market. So if they say 1,800 target people believe it's no  big deals if it goes to $1800, Goldman said so, BUT once it gets there people start to scare and push it down further, Goldman sits back and waits for the bottom. Do what they do, not what they say.

Bureaucrats they are not, bank employees they are. They officially report to the share holders of the federal reserve which are a hand full of very rich families. They are not employees of the US Government.

It won't come in, I transferred $300 to coin base on May 18 with the intent of buying 3 ether @ $93 ea. The site said The same thing about 3 to 5 days. After four days the transfer disappeared from Coinbase completely and my buy option became disabled. I have sent three emails and opened four tickets on their support website. I have not received any human response from them. I am now using Gemini which has been very reliable.
