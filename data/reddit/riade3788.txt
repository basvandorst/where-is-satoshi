= International drug dealer

This whole line is false

Actually, everything you said has no basis....
The truth is that Ross was an international drug dealer and he got less than what he deserved

It's not two sides...It's only one ... There was plenty of major news reports on the case and all agree about it... two courts agreed on the verdict and the sentencing being lawful...Plenty of evidence he wanted to kill an informant and paid money for it...His lawyers tried to put a tint on the investigation but couldn't prove that any evidence is made up...In fact, there was overwhelming evidence of his guilt and he was made an example of..but to say he is innocent is far-fetched...at best he should spend only one life in jail

First off there was a mountain of evidence he paid people to get an informant and 5 people killed and although he wasn't convicted of that it was perfectly legal to present that during the trial to prove criminality and two courts accepted that
Secondly, the case of trying to kill an informant is still pending and it's a separate matter.
"In light of the overwhelming evidence, discussed below, that Ulbricht was prepared, like other drug kingpins, to protect his profits by paying large sums of money to have individuals who threatened his enterprise murdered, it would be plainly wrong to conclude that he was sentenced for accidental deaths that the district court discussed only in passing in imposing sentence"
This is from the ruling of the Second Circuit appellate court in 2017 when it rejected the appeal of Ross Ulbricht and upheld his conviction with the same verdict keeping the sentencing of the lower court also you should know that his lawyers never argued innocence ...all they argued is against the life sentence
 "It is very possible that, at some future point, we will come to regard these policies as tragic mistakes and adopt less punitive and more effective methods of reducing the incidence and costs of drug use," the judges wrote.
"At this point in our history, however, the democratically-elected representatives of the people have opted for a policy of prohibition, backed by severe punishment," 
In the end, sentencing guidelines actually justify his life sentence even without consideration of any attempted hit jobs or overdose deaths. The sheer volume of illegal narcotics that the Silk Road sold put Ulbricht in a sentencing category that technically allowed a life sentence
If you didn't know what trafficking drugs is and to what extent silk road was deep in that shit you don't know anything about the case ... Silk road sent drugs from Mexico all the way to Australia as an example.If that isn't trafficking drugs, what is?
Pick a better source next time other than TV fiction
This is only from wired and not an opinion piece like what you linked but rather a news piece:

When you try to get people killed you kinda become criminal not to mention running an international drug smuggling operation ...

Who would believe a TV documentary when there are dozens of info online from reputable sites including the indictment itself....please..
@_date: 2018-04-01 01:45:22
look ...drug money (bitcoin) was seized and drugs were intercepted many times you know nothing of the case or the law apparently so it's gonna get nowhere ..you seriously need professional help if you really believe what you wrote in that last part...sleep tight

You know nothing of the law 
First off the CDA 230 provision applies to civil cases and not criminal ones but clearly, you didn't know that because, as stated before and proven then, you are a moron
secondly, the CDA 230 protect the web service provider to this extent: as long as they were ignorant of activities taking place on its pages, they weren’t liable for them
thirdly The CDA 230 deals with information and does not extend to the subject at hand
But mostly point 1 where the CDA does not protect web providers from criminal liability as law states
Again you are arguing without merit...The case was just and the law was upheld twice and Ross got much less time than he deserved but then comes a moron to defend him like you...Oops! 
And on the off chance you didn't get it: Yes Craigslist would be liable for something advertised on their website if that was part of a criminal offense. That's mainly why sites like Reddit censor content and respond to reports from users because failing to do so puts them in jeopardy 
The CDA 230 is not a blanket immunity and this has been shown many times
Go defend the youtube shooter maybe you'll have a better luck...
