in another cryptocurrency with lower price and good tech

I think it is a scam.

I defenetly missed the boat and I should have invested when it was 1000-2000 dollars. But now, Iam not sure price is quite high.

I would just invest in another currency which has a bright future (after doing weeks of research) and has a low price. So when this currency is 5 dollars its much easier to get to 10 $. I think the masses of people think that Bitcoin is to expensive and most do not know that you can buy 0.4 Bitcoin. By the way most people I know do not use Bitcoin as payment because it has to much value and increases in value all the time.

I did not say that this a good thing. That is my assumption what will happen, if Bitcoin succeeds.
