Any suggestions on a good or bad time to buy books or videos etc? I feel like that's most important to understand. Thanks

Is the value of btc going to go down after fork? I removed all my btc out of Coinbase because I was scared. Any tips?

What is the fork? I'm a newbie too and I bought some bitcoin today for the first time.

Is it dumb to keep my coins in Coinbase, I don't have a lot tbh and I don't want to pay the transaction fee.(will the fork screw me this way?) thanks

Would you give me some tips on trading? If it can make me enough money to live off weekly I would like to learn more about it.

I wanted to own bitcoins. But in the long term I wanted to make money on them.

Thanks, would you say buying bitcoin now is a smart thing to do? I just want to buy some and then let it grow and help me pay for living costs really.

Sorry to question again. I've got a block chain and Coinbase account now. I want to transfer my btc to my wallet as I heard it's bad to keep it in the exchange. However, there's like a £1.80 transfer fee, it's quite a big loss to my btc amount by transferring so it's upsetting me. Is there anyway around this?
@_date: 2017-10-23 15:14:32
Okay so what should I do? Move it all to blockchain?

What Wallet is good to use? I see there is coin base and blockchain
