Digibyte was among the symbols in there at the end of the video!  And very nice video with explanation.

Yeah, but your putting dollars in mutual funds.  The value of the dollar is dropping every year.  I think at some point it will just fall off the cliff.  While bitcoin continues to expand.  One is contracting and the other is expanding.  I still have a 401k.  As soon as I heard about bitcoin and realized what it was.  I stopped the 16% and started putting 3% just enough to take advantage of my employers free money.  And here I’m hoping I’m not throwing money away in a 401k.  Bitcoin is the future.
@_date: 2018-08-11 07:53:06
Will that change the fact that the dollar would continue growing weaker to the bitcoin until its traded, so the amount of bitcoin it could have been traded for continues declining. So you would ultimately be losing the longer you stay in fiat.  Is that logical?

I hope it keep going down too.  I’m waiting to pull the trigger on $2400

If his prediction comes true by 2022.  Then my dream of bitcoin being $120,000 some time in 2019 isn’t too far off.

Makes sense..or it could slow down the increase even more to 3 years by a factor of 10 or later since its showing that type of pattern...because first it was 1 year then 2 years...I say it will take 3 years 
2017 - $10,000
2020 - $100,000
2023 - $1,000,000
And then increase by a factor of 10 every 4 years.
2027 - $10,000,000
2031 - $100,000,000
So either way, the price is going to be $100,000 either by the end of 2019 or 2020...
And then in 5 years
2036 - $1,000,000,000
Why is this possible...because bitcoin has a fixed supply...and as more people learn about bitcoin, the more people buy/sell bitcoin the price goes up even faster and faster and faster...
@_date: 2019-06-26 17:41:07
True.  Fiat would be finished.  And I think we would be trading different cryptos for spending
@_date: 2019-06-26 16:54:52
$13,400 now!  I don’t know whether to be happy or not.  I can’t get anymore cheap bitcoin like this...but I like seeing the rise.

Your dad is part of the small percentage of people that understands...Everything will change!  Your dad is a smart man investing not on emotions but with intellect.  Bitcoin is here to stay.  
@_date: 2018-11-20 09:01:31
But, bitcoin has done that like eight previous times
@_date: 2018-11-20 08:59:45
I hope it goes to 3k.  I spent a whole year getting my first bitcoin. I was only going to get one bitcoin, but these prices are sweet christmas.

So you’re telling me that we are an eternal being that created all thoughts, concepts, ideas and things in every context that could ever possibly exist from itself as separated versions of itself by vibrational levels divided into many different facets of creation experienced as an illusion of separation by the lower vibratory consciousnesses living in that illusion of separation of experiential reality of which it is all just one as the Bitcoin.  Ok, I think I understand now.
@_date: 2018-03-14 02:25:58
Good points.  I think that exchanges being hacked is the natural evolution of things.  Exchanges are centralized and can be taken down.  We need decentralized exchanges that will create a unity of protection and an impenetrable defense that grows tougher and stronger the more investors it gains.  At that point I believe hackers would seek out certain individuals with large sums of coins, but even that individual would be strongly protected by the unity of a decentralized exchange.  
So these whales losing their bitcoin seems to be the natural order of things to prevent too much consolidation of power in one location.  You get too big and the hackers come for you.  Just the natural order of business, it seems even hackers have a purpose in all of this.

I own 1 bitcoin.  Took me all this year to get it. Now, it’s looking like I possibly could own a few more...Just keep dropping that’s all, go $500.

Bitcoin suffered those things in the past and it bounced back stronger and higher.  The fact that attacks on bitcoin have become more aggressive is only because bitcoin is getting bigger and bigger.  And with it comes increased security to learn from past mistakes.  You think that’s the end?  Bitcoin is in a growing stage and probably will be for 20 years.
These attacks, and schemes serves a purpose of weeding out the weaknesses of bitcoin.  In fact, that’s how all of life works.  You find out what works and doesn’t work.  You become stronger by knowing your weaknesses and strengthening them.  That’s there only purpose...there making bitcoin stronger for the future.  There will be bigger and stronger attacks in the future as bitcoin reaches new all time highs.  This cycle will inevitably continue until bitcoin is too strong even for the fiercest attacks and schemes.  
So all of the attacks by hackers, schemes, bad ideas If they never happened.  And bitcoin reached a price of $1million, $2million a coin.  And then all of sudden those things begin to happen it would be really really bad for bitcoin because they would not know how to fix it and bitcoin would probably crash never to rise again...
Looking at it hindsight, it looks bad.  Long sight, and bitcoin has proven to learn from these things and get stronger each time.  Right now, it’s going through another detox crisis.
So, if you think it will come out of this detox crisis.  The putting all your money in it will be extremely profitable.  If you think this detox crisis will kill it then don’t put any money in...But, to kill it...means it has to go to $0.  If it doesn’t then that means bitcoin is coming back stronger than ever.

They’re bs.  That’s easy to know.  Crypto is volatile.  So why would you give it an A or an F.

These crashes happen all the time through bitcoin years...But, it steadily ascends and that’s the most important thing.  I’m not selling.  I hope it comes down to $5000 and take its time going back up so I can get a full bitcoin.

Some things happened in the past consistently.  Yes, that would be true.  Things that haven’t happened in the past is what your still waiting for, and you talking about sound logic?
@_date: 2018-02-07 16:43:00
That is obvious.  But, that’s not a bad thing.  The weaker crypto currencies will fail.  It’s a natural survival of the fittest, the best technology while the ones that is the most beneficial for us will thrive.
@_date: 2018-02-08 14:12:59
So a lot of people lost money from a hackers job.  On the bright side, that hacker created a bargain sale and I got more coins at a lower price.  Thank you hacker?
@_date: 2018-02-04 16:24:59
I would agree with you.  This does no service to herself, just teaches you to take credit for someone else’s work.  
@_date: 2018-02-04 04:31:04
If that trend continues and I believe it will.  Then the next massive rise in bitcoin begins within the next month or 2.

Fun isn’t something one considers when balancing the system. But this, does put a smile on my face.
@_date: 2018-02-02 21:10:08
I tend to think in terms on a macro scale, the big picture.  And not so much micro.  If you look at society, everything is becoming so much more interconnected and free.  Social media, news, countries, trading, the internet, Amazon, Netflix their expansion into other territories like less fortunate countries.  Is it no wonder that now we have something like the internet of money.  
If one thing fails, it effects us all.  The one and strongest thing of all that’s resisting this interconnection on a global scale is the financial system.  So, it’s no secret that it would provide the most resistance and be the last thing to change.  
But, it is inevitable that it too will have to change...because everything on all levels has been changing and moving us into a free society.  The financial system is the biggest of all and we have finally arrived at it to witness its conclusion in the next 10-20 years.  I’m pretty sure that when the stock market crash from a height so high it will break never to rise again and be replaced by a system (crypto) ready to take its place.  The current stock market growth is a trap.

Oh thank god, cause there fees are ridiculous.  Coinbase better do something.  Because I’m signed up to Robinhood crypto.  
@_date: 2018-04-10 13:08:12
Save this guy’s comment and let’s look back 5 years.  If you think bitcoin is going to crash you’re crazy.  The possibility of that is over, not with Wall Street investors getting in the game now.  And the government wanting you to pay taxes on it and laws are being written to regulate it...people are willing to commit crime to get it, rob, burglarize, hack, etc.  All other cryptos are measured in bitcoins...Bitcoin is being woven into the fabric of society...Bitcoin will be over $100,000 within 7 years. 2025.

This chart is very close to my bitcoin being $120,000 dream a day ago....and that chart lines up exactly with what I determined.  It reaches $120,000 sometime next year.  One year and a half.
