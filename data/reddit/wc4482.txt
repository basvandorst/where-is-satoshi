There's lots of different wallets. They all do the same basic thing, some with more features than others. Just like when smartphones came out there were tons of Internet browsers. Dolphin. Opera. Firefox. Chrome. Opera mini. Dolphin mini. Dolphin pro. Etc. 
Try them all out and pick one you like. 
For me I like one good Web wallet and one good phone wallet.
Web: Coinbase is king. You can buy and sell as well as accept payments as a merchant, set up recurring transactions, send out email invoices and create tip buttons for your website. Also they have a partner called libratax that helps you file your taxes for any gains/losses/income in bitcoin. 
Android: Mycelium is highly recommended because of its features. 
An easier mobile wallet with the bonus of a local bitcoin directory built in is airbitz.co 
It's even worth having if you don't use as a wallet, the directory that is .
Edit: The simplest Web wallet is circle.com .  There's beauty in the simplicity. 
Edit 2: Both Web wallets mentioned above have smartphone apps, so you can access your Web wallet on the go. The biggest difference between Web wallet and phone wallet (or pc) is that Web wallets keep the private keys for you, meaning you trust them to keep them safe and to not be evil. Phone wallets it's all on you to backup the private keys and keep them safe. 
Last but not least, Paper wallets are great for cold storage (bitcoin can only be lost through theft or destruction)

For gifts, nothing is reportable until you sell or trade it for something else. Then you would have a reportable gain.
If someone gave me $100 in bitcoin, I have no taxable income or gain as long as I hold that property. If I wait two years and then buy a jet ski worth $2000 with that bitcoin that used to be worth $100, I now have realized and recognized a capital gain. The gain is the value of property I received ($2000) less the cost basis in the property given up (unknown, thus assumed to be zero). I have a $2000 gain to report on my return. which would be taxed between 0% and 20% rate depending on my tax bracket. 
Because I held the bitcoin for 12 months or more. It's a long term capital gain which is going to be taxed at a better rate than the rate that ordinary income is taxed at. If my holding period is short term  (under 12 months) then it's taxed at ordinary rates. 
Technically your cost basis for determining gain or loss is the cost that your bitcoin donor paid to acquire the bitcoin that he/she gifted to you. Problem is no one gives someone a changetip and then also communicates what the carryover tax basis attached to that bitcoin should be.

More selling than buying. 
In all seriousness, even if someone was watching the game and decided they were going to buy a lot of bitcoin, how long would it take them to figure out how to do it and then to do it? We saw people thrilled to tip in the contest and even tried using bitcoin to do so, but some had huge issues a d confusion which caused them to give up. 
We need to make it easier to buy as a community. Video tutorials and walk through guides, etc.
Maybe if a buying service like coinbase also sponsored the game next year, the masses would be exposed to easy ways to buy BTC. This game was all about where to spend your BTC, hence the selling pressure?
What about those ETFs? How far away from market are those?
2014 had great merchant adoption and innovation, but 2015 should focus on consumer integration

Thanks for the tip!
So far my experience with buttercoin has been very pleasant. Their fees can be lower than coinbase for large amounts of USD. All I loaded was $100 and it cost me $0.88 to do so. (0.5% + $0.38) Trading doesn't have any fees at least right now. And I was able to make up for the fees and then some by putting in a bid order a couple of dollars below market, which was filled on a price dip :)
All in all 9/10 would do again. Only thing I wish they had was faster ACH, maybe they could use Knox payments like changetip does. It took 3 business days to get USD onto the exchange.

Also if someone wants to try a bitcoin transaction with you, have them download the  wallet. There key is automagically encrypted and backed up to the cloud upon setup, so as long as they remember their username and password, they will always have their bitcoin.

Yes, every trade involves a buyer and seller... but I think you aren't appropriately contemplating how a large buy affects a free market.
Think of it this way. Lets say you are a holder of BTC. What price are you holding out for? $700? $1200? $10000? One could argue that every btc owner would become a seller if the price was right (to a certain extent). 
Now lets think about the order book on an exchange. Active asks on that book represent the people who have independently  determined that the asking price is 'right' for them. They are willing to sell x coins at ~$370/coin.
What's my point? Maybe $370 is not enough for a lot of people to part with their bits (most assuredly it isn't). But for some owners it is enough. 
If OP's millionaire buys out these sellers, the price will undoubtedly  go up because there are less people who are willing to sell at or around 370. Let's say that there's some bystanders who previously did not have any orders on the book,  but now see this large buy from the millionaire and join the fray, starting an upward trend. There's more bids and less asks, hence the price movement.  
Maybe once the price hits $390, that triggers a bunch of holders to come out from the sideline and place some more asks- because the price is right. 
Tl;dr you can't isolate a specific buyer and seller, when looking at what influences price. You must take into account the entire market- active orders and players that have not yet, but are likely to, place active orders.

That's for gift tax not income tax. And it's an annual exclusion per donor. Gift tax is reportable by the donor not the donee.

I wouldn't say bitcoin doesn't work for microtransactions, just because you have to pay $0.03 to send a dollar. It might not be perfect, but it still works and is miles better than all the other existing payment methods. 
I saw a remittance service charge a flat £5 rate to send anywhere between £0.01 and £50. Can you imagine paying 5.01 to send 0.01 of something??
Edit to say: I agree with your suggestion to use changetip. That's what I chose to send the winner $5. Keep in mind that changetip is only offering free withdrawals for another 6 months. Then it will be 1%

Multisig is an extra security feature. You set the parameters when you create the wallet. If it's a 3 of 3 wallet then you have three separate keys and all three have to sign the same transaction for it to be processed and to become part of the blockchain.
The idea is it is harder to compromise all three private keys and thus prevent a single point of weakness.

I looked at the 1 hr charts and bitstamp was between $353 and $355 around 9am - 11am yesterday. 
Since you spent $100 and received 0.285, your cost basis is $350.88/btc. They gave you $5 worth free though. So 0.285 into $105 is $368.42. So about a 3-4% spread if you didn't get the $5 free. 
I'm fine with libertyx.com making a profit, they are providing a valuable service. Spreads on localbitcoins.com can be way higher for certain locations.

If you are buying small amounts of bitcoin, Coinbase is actually better than CampBX. The 1% fee + $0.15 is way better than the $1.50 USPS Money Order + Stamp Fee or the $2 ACH Deposit (still in Beta) fee for under $500 deposits.
I guess if you get verified then personal checks are the way to go, but I'm still waiting on verification. 
On the other hand, right now CampBX's exchange rate is at $970 and Coinbase's is at $1,053. Local Bitcoins is like $1,150. Must be because it's hard to get cash on CampBX's site. Might be worth the delay though.

There are many lightweight clients and web wallets which allow you to use Bitcoin without downloading the block chain. 
Multibit, electrum, armory, coinbase.com, blockchain.info to name a few.

The market will reopen on schedule today, at 23:00:00 UTC. Your patience has been appreciated.
Our team has worked tirelessly through the Christmas break, and you’ll be pleased to see several new features implemented when you log back into the market. More features will be rolled out on a daily basis, check the Silk Road Discussion forum for daily updates.
But in order for this community to grow it is important that I remain as transparent as possible. 
There is a pressing issue I want to make you all aware of. And I won’t play it down – it will affect many of you. 
This is a very hard announcement for me to write. It would be far easier for me to follow in the footsteps of dishonest market owners, and blame this issue on a fictional bug. I now understand the inner conflict they were feeling when they decided to lie to their own communities.
I must be honest. Silk Road was built with integrity, and that means continuing to be honest with the community even if it will trigger severe backlash.
So, here is the issue, followed by our plans to resolve it.
**The Issue**
As you know, DPR has been absent for several days now. The good news is that the contingency plan has been followed precisely, and is mostly on track. I hoped to never need to play more than a silent role in this movement, and I am distraught that we needed the contingency plan so early on: roughly forty-five days after relaunch. But let’s be glad the plan was there. 
When we began building the Silk Road's second iteration, we decided that our servers should store as few Bitcoins as possible to minimize risk. The list of marketplaces on the darknet which have been hacked for Bitcoins is far longer than it should be. Lessons haven't been learned by many administrators.
We implemented a cold storage system similar to systems used at many banks and Bitcoin exchanges. This system stored the majority of user and escrow balances on computers completely disconnected from the internet. Throughout the week, we would transfer funds to/from cold storage to ensure enough balance on on each server for projected daily operations.
It was an attempt to learn from the mistakes made on SR1, to protect your funds in the event of a catastrophic hack or server seizure. 
Unfortunately this week we learned that this approach was not perfect, and we again find ourselves in the humiliating position of learning from a fresh mistake.
When DPR disappeared, Cirrus wisely encouraged everyone to withdraw all coins from the marketplace. In the aftermath, I ensured that the servers stayed online for an extra day, and deposited the majority of my personal funds into the server to prevent the balance from going negative as orders were finalized in the withdrawal rush.
The contingency plan worked flawlessly except for one critical failure: When DPR hit his killswitch, I was to receive an encrypted message with the keys to access the escrow cold storage. I am still waiting for it. 
I cannot elaborate on the specifics of the killswitch mechanism or the Captain's present situation, as it will cause more harm than good. We do know for a fact that he has not been compromised or detained by our oppressors, and that he does not hold any information which would threaten any within this community.
After last week's mayhem, it is now apparent that we have lost ability to unlock the Escrow wallet's cold storage mechanism which contains over 90% of user escrow funds.
All Bitcoins in users’ balances are available and safe.
But all Bitcoins that were left in Escrow over the Christmas period will be temporarily unavailable.
In other words, if you have funds in escrow, you will not be able to access them yet even once they are released/refunded to you.
I take full responsibility for allowing this foolish single point of failure, and will personally commit to repaying all escrow balances within the next four months by working unpaid. All staff is on the same page with me on this.
To be clear: This does NOT apply to your Silk Road account balance, and it does NOT apply to any funds you deposit to the market (or place in escrow) from now onwards – it applies ONLY to funds that were left in escrow before Christmas.

Another option is to buy bitcoins for no fees on coinbase and then use them to buy things. If you are going to spend the money anyway, might as well help the community. 
Edit: coinbase announced no fees for buying and selling Bitcoins today only, for black Friday.

To answer your question with not many words: send 1 satoshi + mining fee to somewhere and include with the transaction some bytes of data that is significant. Like the hash of something.

Hopefully can fact check me and give his opinion on this. Here I go:
[1] I do not think that an individual, like would be required to recognize taxable income for the gifts he received last Saturday for the bitcoin donations. **[§102]( states that Gross Income does not include the value of property acquired by gift, bequest, devise or inheritance.** 
[2] The question then becomes, what is the tax effect, if any, upon disposing any bitcoin via: exchange with legacy currency, gifted to an individual, charitably donated or used to purchase real world items or services. 
The most common use would be sale or exchange. If any bitcoin was sold or used to pay for real world goods or services, the taxpayer would recognize a taxable gain or loss, to be computed pursuant to [§1001]( Under this statute, taxable gain is calculated as the excess of the amount realized (i.e. value of cash or goods/services received), over the cost basis in the property disposed (bitcoin); however, we have a problem. A donee's (bitcoinsignguy) basis in the donated property (bitcoins) is equal to the carryover basis as if in the hands of the donor, per [§1015]( 
One feature of the Bitcoin protocol is pseudonymity. Each address is unique; however its owner's identity is not necessarily known. This makes it more difficult to contact each donor who provided a gift in order to ask them for their cost basis in the bitcoin sent to the "hi mom" vanity account. In other words, if the cost basis is indeterminable, we must assume it is zero. Any bitcoins sold, or used to purchase anything, would be completely taxable (fair market value of property/services or cash received = amount of gain). The character of these gains is not known (lack of regulation), but most likely these gains would be short-term capital gains (unless held for longer than 12 months), and thus taxed at [ordinary income rates](
[3] But I digress: In the present case, bitcoinsignguy donated a large sum of bitcoins to Sean's Outpost, which I presume is a [501\(c\)(3)]( charity. Remember that event [1] above (receiving gifted bitcoins) was not a taxable event. Consider in scenario [2] above (selling bitcoins for cash) that taxable gain was recognized in the amount of the fair market value of property and cash received, less the tax basis in the property given up (zero). 
Using that line of thinking, what happens in [3]? Bitcoinsignguy disposes of his bitcoins when he gives it to Sean's outpost, for nothing in return. Since he didn't receive anything, there is no amount realized and thus there is no taxable gain. Actually, according to [§170]( bitcoinsignguy is normally entitled to a charitable deduction for his donation, however the deductible amount is limited to his tax basis in the property. Since his tax basis is presumed to be zero, he is not entitled to a deduction.
**TL;DR Not certain, but fairly comfortable that donating zero cost-basis bitcoin to Sean's Outpost is not a taxable event. Rich people do this all the time with appreciated stock.**

Please note that I have not researched this matter in depth. Also note that there has no formal guidance from the IRS on the tax treatment of bitcoins and on transactions involving bitcoins. Please consult with your tax adviser.

I've tipped like $5 in Bitcoin throughout reddit. Just because you can't see it, doesn't mean it doesn't exist 
@_date: 2013-11-29 00:09:33
I also think the service wising up to the block chain is definitely plausible. Two issues though:
1) BTC is a global currency, and since the IRS only has the jurisdiction to tax US citizens, it will be no easy task to separate US taxpayers from the rest of the world. Maybe they will call upon the NSA for help? *shudders*
2) Since wallets are easily and freely created (some sites even recommend creating a new wallet for each transaction), I imagine the task of correlating hundreds of million wallets to any group of individuals would be so overwhelming... Would they even attempt it? 
On the other hand a whitelist would make this much easier. (However, I think a whitelist would not be good for Bitcoin as a whole)
@_date: 2013-12-03 23:12:06
Where are you from? What exchanges do you have available to you?
I also dislike the time lag (thanks to Fiat) in getting my local currency changed into bitcoins. What I'm thinking of doing is buying a little bit extra bitcoin every two weeks or so. Almost like giving myself a bitcoin salary. As long as the fees aren't too high, the exchange rate can even work in your favor.

Can we have a discussion on whether or not Bitcoin donations may qualify as nontaxable gifts (if under the annual threshold ~$13,000) under IRC 102?
"Gross income does not include the value of property acquired by gift, bequest, devise, or inheritance."

Wash sales only matter for losses.

There are multiple addresses per user account and multiple addresses that coinbase uses. I doubt you could ever track all the accounts that are coinbase's due to the pseudo anonymous nature of Bitcoin and the ease on creating a new address. 
You really need to watch that interview with the coinbase CEO. Let me see if I can find it.

Wash sale rules only disallow losses if you sell an item and buy back into said item within 30 days before or after the date of sale. 
As far as I know you can use any appropriate method for allocating basis to offset your capital gains. I see most often people using specific allocation, so that they can plan to reduce their gains closest to zero without generating losses (which could be disallowed under wash sale loss rules).
The 8949 would show as type C (1099 information not provided to the IRS).

You don't have to identify which basis you are using until you prepare your tax return. 
As far as the wash sale loses go, you are right: if Bitcoins are not defined as stocks or securities, then the rule would not apply. Like you said, there hasn't been any guidance released yet.

Consider using  to buy using BTC on any site, including Amazon. They charge a 2% fee but if you time it right (when BTC is trading high in relation to the dollar) its not bad at all.

@_date: 2013-12-03 23:34:40
Little fiesty there. I was directly addressing the comment I replied to. You had said that USD on an exchange means you are predeterming to spend that money only on a vendor that accepts Bitcoin. There are services out there that let you spend BTC on anything. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 12:38:11
Well, that is a separate, additional problem you have, and yeah.. Obviously snap card doesn't help you add BTC to your wallet... 
But you gotta remember, if all people simply buy bitcoin, stockpile bitcoin, and do not spend bitcoin, then the collective worth of the bitcoin protocol depreciates (since its highest purpose is as a transactional exchange).
In that case, you have the complete opposite problem than the one in your original comment. You didn't spend your high valued bitcoin, and now the price of that bitcoin is dropping.
I don't see what is so hard in buying more Bitcoin than you intend on saving for investment purposes, and spending the difference on things that you were going to buy with USD or your local currency anyway.....

I get what you're saying though. I have less obligations than you, so if i buy some slending bitcoins and the price dips down, I can postpone my purchases until the exchange rate rallies. 
My use case was more for holiday gift shopping and other infrequent items. I rather the BTC community get my business. Hopefully other people increase their Bitcoin spending, which would make it more lucrative for more Bitcoin startups to solve some of the problems you mentioned, such as liquidity and ease of everyday use.
