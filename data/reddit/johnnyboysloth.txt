All I'm saying is we need a solution to the current problems that society has, such as again : pot holes, crime, health. The current solution we have ( Government ) AGAIN is not even close to the best solution, but it's the only solution we CURRENTLY have, so you saying to get rid of it, without having a replacement or fixes, is plain stupid and ignorant.

I think it's your ignorance, that's the issue.
Obviously we won't forget the knowledge of how to fill a pothole, but lets say there is a pothole, then who's responsibility is it to fix it? Who pays for it? How do we know it will get done properly?
And thanks for leaving out my first point, what if there's a fire? What if there's a robbery? What if there's a car crash and someones bleeding out?
Answer me those please, if you can't, then we need a government, because I can't.

I believe we can come up with something better, absolutely, which is why in my original comment, I said "FAT goose" but your original point was to not have a government AT ALL, which would crumble everything, beyond just the current fiat system.

Great response, thank you!

Although I agree that they shouldn’t have as much power as they do, I find it silly to compare law enforcement to pizza delivery drivers. Yes, they can possibly arrive faster, but are they trained to apprehend the suspect? 
I would love a decentralized fiat, however I also don’t mind paying to feed the fat goose, to make sure not every single road doesn’t have pot holes, and that there’s firemen available in case my neighbor or I cause a fire.
Which wraps it back to this post, with the power of currency in the hands of citizens, governments will really have no choice, but to service us, if not, then we don’t send bitcoin. But to say government shouldn’t exists period, is imo not a good thing.

I actually enjoyed watching it, mostly because I have a gambling problem myself

I feel like it's on the verge of spiking up. It's going to squeeze out the weak hands for just a little longer, then explode.  
OR it crashes back to 6k and I lose money.

Ok, what if your goal was to shit in the toilet?  
Would it be easier to just shit directly into it, or go for a jog to the bank, then come back and shit into it?  
Stop being so dense.

Yeah.. Don't use it as your savings account. That's stupid.  
My method of Dca'ing is just throwing bits of cash from each paycheck at crpyto, if I feel like it's undervalued at that moment, I'll throw in more than usual.

Is that right? ��

Don't worry about the near price, look forward to the future price.
  
In the mean time, yes looks pretty bullish, but after $4,200 I would expect a pretty large move. However, that's not to say the bear markets over, until then.

Litecoin baby

That's funny, because it's failing right now.

I’m in Colorado, and the closest dispensary uses litecoin and bitcoin!
