Theoretically yes.
But it's needed to be promoted a bit

How much mining gives you per month in gross and what are the expenses? I was thinking to invest in mining with my partners about 500k, but we don't know much about it. The main thing is to get cheap electricity - this opportunity we have. But we don't understand how to properly choose which crypto to mine and how to build effecient harware for mining

Better move to hard wallet, if you not gonna trade this month/

95%? May be, if we are talking about portfolio under 10k, then it could be reasonable.
I don't see, how can you have balanced invest portfolio, if you have 95% in crypto

If you are saying so, it means, that you convert all your salary/incoming to crypto, leaving 1% in cash. Is that correct? imho, it's too much. And you don't have so many places, where you can spend crypto atm.

It means going all-in. Of course, it's good for the industry that there are such people. But risks to lose a lot of your portfolio is too high.

If you have more than 1000$ in BTC or other crypto, Ledger Nano S is a good choice. Keep in mind, that in Europe now there is huge delay, if you order now, you need to wait ~4-5 weeks.
So if you plan to invest more in future, just buy this tool, you will never regret.
