This guy could literally pay to launch a lambo to the moon. Seems to me a whole heap of ego checking is in order.
And as for the flip phone remark, Berkshire Hathaway own 2.5% of Apple.

Admitted? As if there were ever any other outcome...

It's still very beta, but it's coming along nicely and should have no problems scaling. It's already handled thousands of tx/s under stress testing.

Bitcoin is difficult to suppress in Venezuela precisely because the country is going to shit. The point I was making is that if you make something illegal, then provide a reasonable alternate whilst taking steps to reduce the viability of / increase the risk associated too the thing you're banning, you will most likely succeed. Venezuelas fiat (the alternate) broke through the 2300% inflation rate this year, her citizenry are not being given many good options.
I just assumed the downvote was you, my apologies if not.

Yea I'm not here to argue with the cognitive bias. The answer is obviously yes. Venezuela is an obviously flawed example given the extenuous political climate and general lack of parallels to relatively stable countries. The better question though is would a democratic government be sufficiently motivated to do so. That's a separate debate but I personally lean strongly toward no. Enjoy the tiny bit of vindication you experience down voting things you disagree with.

Why'd you list bitcoin twice? 
@_date: 2018-08-10 00:34:26
Yup. Let it go to zero, i don't care anymore. I'm holding out of spite. Fuck the market. Fuck it all.

You trying to bait me into a r/iamverysmart reference, or are you just a bitter bch boy flailing about aimlessly? Either way, you're amusing. Bring on some more.

Of course they can. Trading bitcoin is trading information, and there are already countless examples of information you are neither allowed to trade or possess. Enforcement is difficult, but steep penalties and the average unwillingness to risk stepping outside the law is reasonably suppressive.

I also get to loan your ball out to other people who will pay me for using your ball. If I loose your ball, your parents will buy me a new ball out of your pocket money - which I may or may not give to you.

Good to see there are others lurking with their bs filters up and operating. I might take a peek into this.
Edit: having looked (and being a a full stack hosting/crm dev), I can't quite see how this PODS system is expected to work. People have always owned their own personal info, the problem has been _after_ you grant it to a 3rd party. Unless Solid intends to jail apps to client instances (which would make it untenable for many projects), those apps will simply take that access and abuse it like they do now. For now, this sounds DoA.
