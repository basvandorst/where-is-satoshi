Yes. This exactly. It went from being an extremely useful tool to the equivalent of digimon cards.

Yea, you're right. I hope lightning gets more accessible. Just wanted peoples thoughts. Especially people who still feel strongly about bitcoin, I'd like to hear the reasons.

I guess my issue is, I used to hold bitcoin and nobody could tell me otherwise. It's not real money, it's a scam, it's a pyramid scheme. I knew deep down it was a genius idea with a ton of potential. I had people advise me to sell a bunch of times and I just held and held. But I am a broke student. And having so much of my total worth in bitcoin made sense when I strongly believed in it. It's just harder to believe now that it's so slow and expensive. 
I don't want to support ripple either. The banks are not our friends, that's the whole point.

I want to sell and don't know how to go about it. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:04:01
Yea. Don't want to sell all of it. Just kind of broke and seems like not the worst time. I have no idea how I would claim taxes because I have been buying and spending little bits and pieces at different prices for years just to keep my wallet balance the same.

Bitcoin is not anonymous unless they were obtained anonymously. The thing is, if you bought bitcoin legally, and you owe me $50. And I ask you to send me bitcoin but I give you an address from a darknet account, then you have just sent BTC to the darknet. So should you be at fault? All addresses look alike. Monero is anonymous but few people are using it. Trading bitcoin for monero, sending the monero to another monero address and then trading it back for bitcoin would give you bitcoin not attached to you in anyway. And the silk road wasn't shut down because of tracing bitcoin. It was shut down by infiltrating the site with undercovers who became admins, and illegally performing DDOS attacks on servers around the world in order to time their attack to the moment silk road went offline. That allowed them to narrow down it's location geographically. Anytime you send someone bitcoin, they could be giving you an address they are using to buy drugs. Just like anytime you give someone money, they could be using it to buy something illegal. Really not your job to get everyone you hand change to to sign a form saying it won't be used illegally.
edit: not to mention, the first mention of silk road was on [shroomery.org]( (great site btw) and he used the same user name he used on a coding forum saying he needed help coding an ebay type website, and then provided a gmail account with his real name. So, yea, nothing to do with bitcoin. There's plenty of ways to use bitcoin anonymously. The transactions are all public. But who the sender and receiver are do not have to be public info. If I make a bitcoin address offline, where no hacker or spy agency can see it, and you send me bitcoin you bought from someone in person, then yea, the transaction is public. But who the owner of the wallets are is not public.
