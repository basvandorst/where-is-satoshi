I remember your post about the lower limit, and thought it was actually a pretty good idea. I'm also assuming that *as few parties as necessary* are trying to create ledger scarcity. I still have some problems with it though:
* The attack has a minimal impact on performance: a malicious miner needs to only self-limit and/or temporarily withhold lucky blocks to perform an attack
* There isn't an incentive to do it now, because the block size limit can't be further reduced (the incentive is to increase the availability of fees through ledger scarcity, forcing users to pay more; the attack doesn't work now because competing miners aren't bound to a reducible limit)
* A moving floor won't mitigate the attack because a malicious agent can simply self-limit at the new floor, until the floor exceeds demand (rendering the attack and the limit obsolete)
* The backlog created by a limit reduction takes time to be processed, during which newer, higher-fee transactions will extend the problem; those higher-fee transactions *are* the attacker's desired outcome
* Competing miners are incentivized to participate in the attack (up to a point) - as backlogged transaction fees increase, so does miners' incentive to limit availability
* Only enough hash power to produce valid blocks is required to perform the attack - even a very small percentage of total hash power can affect the consensus outcome

There was one, before BIP101 was finalized. It was decided to be a bad idea because any floating target that can be decreased, can be maliciously decreased by orders of magnitude without majority control of the network hash power.

Not necessarily. The less work required to confirm a block, the more blocks required to achieve the same level of confidence in the transactions mined in the block. A Litecoin transaction with 1 confirm is basically just as reliable as one with 0 confirms, because it is fairly trivial to mine a longer chain that doesn't include the transaction in question, compared to the same effort against a chain with a higher difficulty.
Consider the theoretical bitcoin-with-one-second-confirms. This means miners don't face a very high work difficulty to mine blocks, and are therefore incentivized to ignore blocks received from other miners and replace them with their own. A miner might receive foreign blocks frequently, but he gains more from the system by ignoring them - and in turn, transactions mined and propagated are not reliable even after multiple confirms; on this theoretical network, I would realistically wait for at least 600 confirmations before considering the transaction to be irreversible with any confidence.
With a ten-minute target time, miners are forced to put in a high level of work to produce a block - making the effort required to replace a propagated block much, much higher, and the confidence in transactions with only 1 confirmation much, much more reliable. It also produces a high barrier to entry for double spend attacks; if blocks are rapidly produced, the opportunity to propagate double spends increases proportional to the reduction in difficulty.
Lower difficulty target = less reliable blocks. Very low difficulty targets render individual blocks completely unreliable.

Why are companies/individuals that support BIP101 being banned? I understand (but disagree with) the "XT is an altcoin" argument, but BIP101 is a BIP, not an altcoin, so I don't understand how that argument extends to adoption/endorsements of BIP's.

Indeed - and isn't that still relevant? After all, it's cheaper to propagate small blocks, and a withholding attack is cheaper than a flood attack, so a reducible maximum block size would enable a malicious agent to inflate the fee market with a minor portion of the hash rate, and miners are naturally incentivized to do so due to the fact that they collect fees.

Proof-Of-Work security depends on the length of time between blocks. Reducing the difficulty target system so blocks can be produced more quickly also reduces the security of each block (as it's easier to produce a competing chain). This means 1-confirm is not enough, anymore. Also, block subsidy would have to be adjusted with it.

~~That's not how blockchain.info works and it is also not how any reasonable bitcoin transaction works. Blockchain.info never holds or delays customer coins because it never controls customer coins. If (when) you are told that blockchain.info has the coin, you are being lied to and have already been scammed.~~
~~When you sent bitcoins to the address provided, it was the provider's responsibility to make the association between that address/transaction and your account. They are literally blowing smoke at you by blaming blockchain.info and claiming they haven't received the coins; if you sent it and it was confirmed, *they received it*. If the blockchain.info API failed, it only failed to send a notification to the wallet's owner that it has received coin. Even if that notification didn't arrive, the coin did. Maybe their automatic system didn't make the association because it didn't get the notification, but that doesn't change the fact that the coin has been sent, received, and confirmed.~~
~~Whoever gave you that address, controls those coins.~~

Wait wait wait *wait wait* wait **wait**.
Pruning nodes **will** relay the blocks that they *actively have on hand*, which is not many but is also not zero. They are supposed to keep a minimum of the 288 most recent blocks on the longest chain seen by the node and there is disk space reservation for this amount.
The release notes explicitly state that pruning nodes will relay recent blocks that they have in their inventory (i.e. not pruned yet). While this excludes most blocks, it is not all, and the most important ones to the health of the network are still relayed!
**[edit]** as pointed out, they don't just yet but are planned to. If you run a pruning node *right now*, your node won't relay any blocks because the feature is still in development.

I prefer the term "Account". You have bitcoins in your Coinbase account. You can transfer them to your wallet. Your wallet isn't an account because it isn't with anyone else; you own it.
There's also the in-between solutions, such as BitGo which is a controlled wallet, *not* an account.

DNS is such an apt analogy for Bitcoin. Monolith hostfiles were replaced with a repository-and-authority model that works far better and is much more efficient. This model is a *natural fit* for bitcoin and it annoys me to no end that the core devs are not focusing on this at all because it is a self-evident decentralized solution!
Pruning Nodes can and would act exactly like a "repository" in this model. They don't have the whole blockchain; just the most important or relevant data (which is agreed to be the last 2 days of blocks, plus the UTXO set or perhaps a "likely subset"). This is *all* a pruning node needs; it doesn't (nor should it) require a wallet or miner. A pruning node can serve as a "local gateway" for a merchant or provider by performing the basic security service of the protocol for local transactions.
Full Nodes act as the "authority" in this model. They maintain the entire blockchain and will provide to any client, on demand, all necessary information to independently verify any and all data on the blockchain. A full node would probably be a requirement for a miner, but wouldn't make sense for a user or merchant.
In this model, your SPV wallet acts like a browser; it executes a lookup request to the protocol, which then retrieves the data from a local or preferred pruning node, which in turn places and relays the results of data requests for any information the pruning node didn't have on hand.
Does this solve the blocksize problem? NO! But it does offer a way to protect end users from it by offering a distinct userspace layer to the protocol upon which solutions are more easily built and deployed. After all, an SPV client doesn't need to know the maximum block size, and an authoritative full node doesn't need to index a wallet. Separation of these responsibilities to clear sectors of the network protocol appears - at least, in my likely under-informed opinion - to be a tested and reliable method of simultaneously protecting the decentralization of the network, reducing strain on network participants, increasing accessibility for end users and app developers, and creating a clear structure of responsibilities that lead to a more reliable, scalable, and responsive protocol implementation.
Or, my brain is addled from lack of sleep and I have no idea what I'm talking about, in which case bring on the downvotes!
@_date: 2015-06-05 17:25:01
Not quite. A new pruning node still needs old information (so it can verify current blocks against old ones). HD wallets require data about old spent outputs that won't be available from a pruned node. The full blockchain does need to be available; although it doesn't require as wide replication as the most recent data, it does need to be accessible.
It's also quite possible that other applications of the protocol require access to spent output data - for example, an application that pairs data with user-requested transactions would need the full transaction information long after the user has spent the output.

* Create a new wallet (File &gt; New Wallet).
* Export that wallet's private key (Tools &gt; Export Private Key) and close Multibit.
* Edit that export file. There's a line containing a new private key with a timestamp; copy that line to the end of the file and replace the copy's private key with the private key to the address you want to import. Adjust the timestamp on that line to reflect a time BEFORE the first deposit to that address (if applicable).
* Launch Multibit and select the new wallet.
* Import the private key from the file (Tools &gt; Import Private Key). Wait for the blockchain to re-sync (usually a few minutes).
* Secure your new wallet with a password (File &gt; Add Password).
* Delete the .key file. For extra security, first edit the key file and replace the private keys with a bunch of X's and save it before you delete (this can help with the potential of data recovery tools obtaining your private key). Alternatively, delete the key file using a shred tool.

They're great because you control when you get a payout, and the minimum pay is 5500 satoshi.

[Land of Bitcoin]( which is *the* one-stop-shop for faucets. It has a faucet-surfing tool that has basically every paying faucet in it, and you can control which faucets you get in the surfer. It also has a built-in background faucet that yields about 2 satoshi per minute, and pays directly to Microwallet on demand with no minimum. They also will let you claim your Daily Bitcoins ad vouchers in exchange for game tickets, which can then be used to play a silly game than can earn you extra satoshis on your faucet balance. The surfer includes all Microwallet and Coinbox faucets as well as a few standalone faucets. Faucet addicts should always have this site open!
[Bitchest]( is another micropayment service like Coinbox, with a tiny twist: they have a constantly updated list of all faucets that use their service right on the home page, complete with timers to show you when you can claim from them again. The timers are linked directly to the payment service, so they are always 100% accurate. This one automatically pays once you reach 5500 satoshi and also displays level-up type stats (although they don't appear to yield a bonus). There's also a notification timer that displays when your payout will occur once you reach the minimum. They're relatively new, and the list of faucets using the service has grown over the past week.

Fees are calculated based on the data size of the transaction. In your case, it sounds like you're trying to spend lots of inputs all at once.
I have a general rule-of-thumb that works quite well. The minimum fee is 0.0001. Every time you receive some amount, you are getting one "coin" (one input). For every five "coins" you are trying to spend, increase the fee by 0.0001.
For example, let's say you collected some satoshis from faucets over time, and received a total of 18 payments. To send all that money at once I would use a fee of 0.0004 (that's the base of 0.0001, plus 0.0003 for the large number of coins being spent).
Older versions of bitcoin-qt had a default fee amount of 0.0005 instead of 0.0001, but even taking that into account the stated fee of 0.045 would indicate you are trying to spend 900 coins, is that about right?

Actually, that's wrong. Most countries have a 'place of strike' law concerning online gaming that basically state that the laws governing whether an online game is legal are determined by the country where the bet is struck. Most laws interpret that to mean the location where the server providing the random data is located, so lots of Bitcoin games are located in countries that allow online gaming in some form. For example, Costa Rican law states that you may host an online gambling service in Costa Rica, but may not provide services that target or cater to Costa Rican citizens (but anyone else is just fine).
However, American law is different. We don't have a 'place of strike' law, and the governing law is determined by the location of the game player, not the location of bet striking. Therefore, online gambling is illegal for American citizens because federal law prohibits the usage of gambling services from a location not inside the state that the gambling service is located in (that's considered interstate money laundering).
Basically, if I live in a state that allows gambling, I'm allowed by federal law to *only* gamble within that state. International gambling is totally prohibited and if I'm a visitor of a state that prohibits gambling locally, I am also federally prohibited from gambling within the state *even if my home state allows it*.
If you're American, and you're gambling with bitcoin, you're probably in violation of Federal laws. However, bitcoin isn't recognized as a "currency" so it is possible you could sealawyer your way out of it in some locations (not mine, where gambling with value tokens or non-valued items is still illegal).

I don't see luke-jr's actions as a problem for Bitcoin. Gentoo/Bitcoin users are a small subsection of node operators so this doesn't have a huge impact on the network.
I see these actions as a problem for Gentoo. This is a growing trend - package maintainers creating custom USE flags and deploying non-vanilla software packages to users who unwittingly use the altered software, THINKING it's the vanilla source when it's not. A small text warning in 8pt gray-on-black doesn't really let the user know that "hey, you're getting an altered version of this software" especially when it's a part of hundreds of pages of such messages (typical during updates and installations).
Bitcoin is just one example of package maintainer abuse in Gentoo; it just happens to be a very controversial one because Gentoo users running the "default" bitcoin client will be (possibly unknowingly) blacklisting certain addresses from their mempool - not at the discretion of the user running the node, but at the discretion of the package maintainer. This is giving the package maintainer (luke-jr) artificial and inappropriate control over user nodes. Whether the nonstandard behavior is "optional" or not is irrelevant; it breaks the philosophy of Gentoo to enable nonstandard behavior by default in a package.

I'm curious about the security measures in CurrentC. The article states it is capable of direct bank withdrawal which sounds like a giant red flag to me. Spending is a "push" operation^*, but the financial service industry has focused on profitable yet risky "pull" operations. CurrentC is a "more convenient pull" - so doesn't that make it riskier? The cynic in me wants to see something like this catastrophically fail just to demonstrate the importance of Bitcoin.
I think commercial "finance innovations" that arise in the face of what Bitcoin offers only serve to underline exactly why we need Bitcoin to support or supplant the existing financial system. Centralized financial conveniences create more points of failure and increase risk for consumers. They also tend to protect investors from that risk and instead saddle vendors and consumers with it, which flies in the face of conventional economics. These "innovations" don't serve commercial or individual consumers a value that justifies the adoption costs and the only reason they gain traction is through market force; CurrentC would never exist if it weren't for Wal-Mart et. al. shoehorning it into existence. You'd think the economists of the world would be looking at the recent rash of data breaches in large-scale commercial ventures globally and start taking a serious look at cryptocurrency as a viable solution to the serious global financial risk of large scale electronic value theft, but i fear it will take a situation even more dire than what we have experienced for that to happen. Consumers will still adopt technologies forced on them so long as they offer the illusion of improvement, so this is an unpleasantly stable situation. CurrentC, Apple Pay, and Google Wallet all have more market saturation than Bitcoin and none of them actually serve to address any of the real problems facing the industry today yet appear to be improvements on the existing system to consumers. This is where Bitcoin struggles: its lack of sponsorship and consumer appeal limits adoption. The former can be overcome but until Bitcoin is obviously easier and cheaper than its competitors for both vendors and consumers, it won't ever really begin to explode.
C'mon, catastrophe.
^* Meaning, when I spend I am giving the value, i.e. "pushing" to its new owner. Compare this to modern point-of-sale systems or automatic bill payments which instead allow merchants to "pull", meaning take the value from its previous owner. This introduces risk by allowing agents other than the actual owner of the value to access it.

Put your source wallet address into the search box at blockchain.info and see if there is a transaction reflecting sending .16 BTC to the Coinbase address you used. If there isn't one, reset the blockchain in your wallet software. If there is, your transaction was mutated by the DoS attack - but the money was still sent. At that point, it's time to wait 24h after the first confirm on that transaction then contact Coinbase support.
The original transaction ID you got when you sent the coins is not reliable (that's the "transaction malleability" issue that everyone is fuming about). Instead, verify the transaction from the sending address. It sounds like the money did successfully send but you'll need to find the transaction on the blockchain to verify it.
Coinbase has been operating very slowly lately - it took nearly 24h for me to do a direct BTC withdrawal to a personal wallet. The transaction *did* eventually clear.

You might be overthinking the security factor. If you want to use one address per transaction (sensible, for accounting purposes) then you don't need to generate them offline; you simply need to generate a new address at the time of purchase and send the coins to a secured address after you deliver the product. Any existing bitcoin wallet can do that for you right now, and if you use a BIP38 enhanced wallet you can even recover those dead private keys from the wallet seed if you need to.

Anything is worth whatever someone is willing to pay for it. On the exchanges, there are groups of people that all put their money behind this assertion: when someone places a bid order for one bitcoin at $650, it means they are willing to pay up to $650 for a bitcoin. When someone places an ask order for one bitcoin at $700, it means they won't let it go for a penny less. When a buyer and seller agree, a price is struck. Lots of buyers and sellers are agreeing to prices in the $650-700 range right now, so that's a good measure of what one is worth.
You seem to be interested in the "intrinsic value" of currency - both bitcoin and government fiat. Consider that the intrinsic value of government fiat is derived from the faith and credit of the issuing government that it operates under. However, the intrinsic value of bitcoin is derived from the security of the cryptography that it operates under.
Cryptography isn't a structure or construct; it's a mathematical system. Which do you trust - a social construction, or a mathematical system? This issue scares me, too; I'm scared of a global economic system built entirely on promises.

Well, well. Another boring article by an ill-informed would-be journalist asserting that Bitcoin is broken or incomplete. Let's see what J.J. Angel gets wrong in this installment of "What don't I know about Bitcoin?"


Well, this whole section is wrong. A bitcoin is not a number with a magical property - that's your *private key* that protects (or spends) your bitcoin. Bitcoin's security is 100% dependent on the *user* and not some "trusted third party" that is going to lose your money for you and then give you the finger when you ask for it back in a timely manner (Target, Wells-Fargo, Visa, need I go on?) That QR code that was flashed on TV? It was behind a flap of paper clearly marked "Open To Spend".


Here, J.J. demonstrates his total ignorance of how Bitcoin works. Suppose a customer tries to buy, and "enters the bitcoin number". Which one, his or the merchant's? Into what, the merchant's POS system, or his privately secured electronic wallet? You know what? It doesn't matter because none of those transmitted numbers are the private key. A hacker would not have access to funds using this method. Now, viruses can and do steal wallets; this is a problem that is correctly identified. Viruses can and do steal credit card and bank information, too. With bitcoin, you don't have to worry about your merchant - or a third party he employs for payment processing - disclosing, losing, or mismanaging your personal data. There's actually *less* fraud risk in making a bitcoin purchase.


This is a problem that is clinging to the disappearance of its own viability. The "Last-Mile" is an issue of currency conversion. If you want to send money to another country, in another currency, with Western Union, guess what? *You have to deal with that problem anyway.* If merchants are using bitcoin internationally, this problem disappears since the recipient wants bitcoins, not a local currency. Also, you won't have to undergo two conversions if your money was already bitcoin to begin with. This "problem" is entirely contrived for the sake of argument, and doesn't actually exist outside the offices of Western Union.


Sure enough, J.J. Angel does not understand the potential of a 51% attack. Guess what? A pool owning 51% of the network *would not be able to spend your money* unless your private key were part of the pool. The threat of counterfeit bitcoins is also founded in flawed understanding; even with 51% of the hashing power, a pool would necessarily have to mine bitcoins to print them - a process *they're already engaged in*, one that is *more profitable* than trying to cheat. The counterfeit bill has a lower face value than the real one they earned legitimately, and costs more to create!


Oh, do I have to bring up Target again? Yeah. Target. Now tell me again that the existing system is less risky, and do it with a straight face. Nice - you should play poker professionally.


This is a feature, not a flaw. People overwhelmingly don't want their currency regulated. Currency regulation can by nature accomplish only two things: hasten devaluation, and assist redistribution. The lack of regulation is one of the *primary* reasons that widespread global acceptance *will* occur. I discuss the pitfalls of regulation further, below.


J.J. Angel, do you understand monetary policy or economics? I think, after reading this stew of misused talking points, that you do not. Policy makers don't decide how individuals spend their money; individuals do. If individuals prefer bitcoin, there is no policy that any government in the world could enact to make that sentiment go away, and any attempts along that vein would only serve to strengthen the bitcoin and devalue the local fiat. Monetary policy historically has done more harm than good to the people who actually use the money being regulated.
Oh, let's not overlook this final part, where J.J. asserts that bitcoin could be *improved* using these two features:
* J.J. claims there is an "alleged limit" to bitcoins. Guess what? You're an "alleged person" and this is an "alleged website". Stop conflating the facts - this is a *hard limit*. Now, it is suggested that a new coin be mined to replace and be supported by USD fiat. This is a terrible idea because it takes three vital features of Bitcoin out of the equation: decentralization, internationalization and scarcity. Allowing a government to manage a coin limits that coin's use to that country, under that government's regulatory framework and supply control systems, will ensure that the coin has less value than whatever currency it was designed to replace, and never reach widespread global acceptance. You might as well stick with Visa, it's got better features than a GovCoin ever could.
* Regulate. Include regulation in the software. Make bitcoin accounts blockable, which can render bitcoins unspendable. And give the power to block accounts to those regulators, so if they arbitrarily deem you to be a criminal, you *can't spend your money*. Yep, that'll help economic growth: introduce a regulating agency that has the power to take away your money. I'd also like to point out the gaping security vulnerability introduced by regulation: what if the government regulator gets hacked? Then, the hacker has control over *every bitcoin on the ledger*. Much scarier than a 51% double-spend.
Decentralization, internationalization, and scarcity are the *three vital features* that make bitcoin a viable medium of exchange and storage of value. Delivering money management from fixed algorithms to the whims of government individuals and agencies destroys the very nature of Bitcoin, reducing it to a fancy version of SEPA. In business, most folks have heard the saying "people fail - systems don't". Well, we have a *mathematical system for managing currency*.
Replacing systems with people is a recipe for failure. J.J.Angel would replace the mathematical system that makes bitcoin work with the whims of government regulators. How is *that* an improvement? Well, I guess that's what you get when someone that is totally ill-informed about a topic gives us his two cents. In the world of technology, the phrase we use to describe this article is simply, "Garbage in, garbage out". J.J., please go learn a thing or two, and replace that garbage input with facts, and maybe your outputs won't be so full of garbage either.

So you attempted to make a purchase using bitcoin, without knowing anything about it, and are now upset that it did not meet your expectations?
This is a bit like buying a refrigerator and being upset that it doesn't also cook your food.
Bitcoin isn't a company. It isn't a payment processor, and it isn't a central authority or money issuer. It is a decentralized network protocol, like e-mail, only instead of messages being sent, it's units of account.
Before you attempt to use something, it's probably a good idea to learn what it is, what it does, how it works, and what the risks are *before* you go through with it.

They usually don't even work, leaving you with no product AND compromised information.

There is no lock so strong that it can prevent someone from stealing the keys. So it goes with computer security; the majority of successful hacks involve data theft and human error, not cryptographic weakness or insecure connections.
This long-winded and technical e-mail is basically the TeamViewer PR way of saying "well if your computer was hacked, you didn't secure our software right in the first place, so don't blame us." It does not address the more important point that TeamViewer is *inherently* an insecure application by function.
The honest truth is TeamViewer has a default security level that is nowhere near what would be appropriate for a high-risk machine (such as one holding private keys to large amounts of bitcoin) and even if you *do* know how to enable all those fancy features, they don't help against the most effective cyberattacks (physical theft of security devices, infrastructure infiltration, and social engineering).
**tl;dr:** Don't use TeamViewer on the same machine you store any remotely significant amount of bitcoin. Also don't use VNC, Remote Login or Remote Assistance, any web service daemon such as httpd, a computer frequently accessed by multiple individuals, or a computer that is configured to share files across a network. **Never** trust a third party's assurances of security; trust the evidence of it (or against it) instead.

It's not quite that easy. Bitcoin has no knowledge or interaction with other coins, so it can't tell when 1337 doge has been received.
Theoretically, what you COULD do is require a coin's signature to include data that is somehow produced by the alt chain.  I'm no crypto expert, so I have no idea how, but that's something that the bitcoin protocol should currently support. It seems simple enough but I don't have enough knowledge to say if this is actually possible.

* pseudonymity - Transactions don't contain any personal data so bitcoin resists ID theft
* trustless - Transactions are secured by cryptography, not a trusted third party
* irreversible - Transactions can't be voided, only rendered invalid if the coins have already been spent
* independently secure - No reliance on an account provider to hold your money where it can be easily spent
* unmediated - Third parties cannot alter transaction value in transit (i.e. no hidden fees)
* programmable - Coins can require more than just a signature to spend and multi-party support is built in
* scarce - Unlike central issue currency, the supply of bitcoins is fixed and finite
* predictable - Monetary supply is controlled by mathematics, not managers
* inexpensive - Payment processing incurs a tiny overhead compared to existing systems
* nearly instant - Payments are seen on the network in seconds and confirmed in minutes in most cases
* anti-fragile - The network is affected positively by independent failures, becoming more durable over time
* redundancy - Lost funds can be recovered from key backups and coins can never truly vanish
* no secrets - The entire transaction history of every coin on the network is publicly viewable
* micro support - The minimum send is very tiny, supporting micro transactions and tipping systems
* easy integration - Requesting a payment is as simple as a QR, button, or link
* open-source - The reference client is fully open source and available to the public

I'm not sure why you sent this coin; sending coins to the same address as the wallet they're already in doesn't accomplish anything positive. This transaction is going to hold up your coin until it confirms or is dropped, for two reasons:
First, you didn't pay a transaction fee. Miners will always prefer transactions with appropriate fees, so you're already lower priority.
Second, you sent what appears to be only 1000 satoshi (0.00001Ƀ) to yourself, which is less than the "recommended minimum" of 5430 satoshi. This minimum is in place to prevent tiny amounts from clogging the network. This doesn't mean your transaction won't confirm, it just means it's not a priority transaction.
While this coin is unconfirmed, you probably won't be able to use it.

Yes, you do control them. bitcoin-qt automatically creates new addresses for change and tracks them internally, but doesn't display them. The sum of the balances on your "main" address and all your change addresses is the total wallet balance, but the UI hides those details because they are irrelevant to the actual wallet balance.

Faster confirm times = more confirms required to achieve same confidence. The hashpower of the mining network is unchanged regardless of confirm time; reducing the difficulty level simply makes it easier to execute an attack by a magnitude equal to the scaling of difficulty. No matter confirm time, it still takes about ten minutes to be confident that a transaction can't be doublespent.
@_date: 2014-02-15 19:16:44
Yep, but you don't have to worry or even think about them because the wallet software keeps tabs on them for you.
Just think of those other addresses as being part of your wallet (which they are). If you spend from this wallet, the client will automatically select the best coins to spend from all the accounts it holds. To the user, the money simply appears to have come from the wallet. On the blockchain, you see the behind-the-curtain mechanics of change addresses in action.
Other wallet clients (e.g. Multibit) don't do this, and instead just use the sending address as the change address. There is no difference in overhead on the network or potential fees in doing it this way - it's just easier to understand when looking at blockchain data, which is *exactly why* the reference client doesn't do that - it attempts to obfuscate transactions in the name of anonymity while Multibit prefers to keep the address count down for clarity.

The blockchain contains a ledger that details the movement of every coin, from generation via mining to its current status. Every transfer is cryptographically signed using a method that shows proof-of-ownership; you can't move a coin without having control of the private key for that coin. So you can't just falsify a record and steal coins.
You can't assign yourself new coins arbitrarily, either; new coins have to be part of a mined block that will only be accepted by the network if it meets a standard that demonstrates proof-of-work. Furthermore, the number of coins available to be newly generated decreases with every block mined, and each block can only assign a fixed number of coins to the miner. A "hacker" attempting to falsify this information would have his attempts rejected by the network, and he would never gain coins.
tl;dr: cryptographic proof of ownership and proof of work

This transaction sent double your bet back to your wallet.
(edit: cut-and-paste fail)
@_date: 2014-01-20 18:15:04
Instead of a timestamp, the system uses transaction sources. Here's how it works, using your example. For the sake of simplicity, we will assume that the initial transaction was a new mint (i.e. mined coins). Note that transactions get a unique ID when they are added to the blockchain; I've used numbers staring with 4 to demonstrate.
Initial: [{MINT} &gt;&gt; A:20.0] -&gt; Signed 4111
First transfer: [A:4111 &gt;&gt; B:20.0] -&gt; Signed 4122
Second transfer: [B:4122 &gt;&gt; C:1.0 B:19.0] -&gt; Signed 4133
Notice this contains some crucial information: the previous transaction ID, and a destination for the change. In this case I've just sent it back to B, although in practice it does not matter. In any case, the "output" for transaction 4122 has been *spent* - all of the 20 coins are gone, elsewhere. An attempt to copy this transaction will fail because B:4122 is marked as "spent". If I wanted to spend that 19 coins' change, I'd have to craft a new transaction based on the new change output:
[B:4133 &gt;&gt; C:1.0 D:1.0 E:1.0 B:16.0]
tl;dr: Copies of a transaction won't work because outputs are spent exactly once.

A lottery would be harder since multiple players are involved, but the concept is the same.

It's a risk I'm more than willing to take. There's plenty of liquidity in the market to make a measly $1K available to me at any time, and the chances of a 400% price increase in the time it takes for sold bitcoins to confirm are basically nil. Even the 4-7 day wait for fiat is not a threat.

I've got a horrible experience directly related to the "fee event".
On 2/20 I ordered a computer from Dell and paid with bitcoins. I paid directly to an address (BIP70) and used priority fees (50 s/b) to ensure that Coinbase wouldn't flag my transaction. The transaction was accepted by the system in about seven seconds and I was sent a receipt. All was good.
However, the computer didn't arrive. I checked the order and it said the order is still pending processing. It took two and a half *days* of phone calls and chatbox conversations with literally dozens of Dell representatives, all to come to the conclusion that Dell's systems did not release the hold on the order once my transaction confirmed; apparently, it took a whopping sixteen minutes to appear in a block and by then Dell's systems assumed I was attempting a doublespend, and reclassified my order as to be paid via prepaid check.
Now I'm in customer service hell. I've spoken with three supervisors and a Bitcoin specialist with Dell and still haven't had the hold on my order removed. They got my money over two weeks ago, and the cause of the problem is, *without a doubt*, a technical error caused by the "fee event".

That PR was introduced by bitcoin-core dev **luke-jr** and is an obvious attack. The proposal "fixes centralization" by *changing the underlying encryption algorithm*. The actual effect of this change would be to render bitcoin-classic a true altcoin. Despite having been asked to not submit PR's for features that haven't been mentioned on the consider page, this is being trotted out as "censorship by jtoomim" - what nonsense, that's like accusing theymos of censorship for closing a PR to change the coinbase reward schedule.


No, the majority of mining pool operators are *on record having stated support* for a 2MB block size cap. This isn't hearsay, this is fact. They aren't just "said to support" - they *do* support 2MB, and several have expressed support for 2MB *before* SegWit.


This is a lie. 2MB is very technically simple to deploy (it's literally five lines of code), has already undergone extensive testing (at scales much larger - 8 and 20MB), exists in code form today, and is known to be safe. Meanwhile, SegWit is still in development and early testing, and is not as well understood (leaving more questions than answers). 2MB is ready to deploy in days, while SegWit is expected to take months.
Again, I find this entire subreddit to be unhealthy. Your completely ill-informed reply asserting *total fabrications as solid fact* are a symptom of the disease that is rotting this community. We cannot possibly have an informed, reasonable, healthy technical debate about the merits of implementation procedures when the arguments being used to support them are *absolutely false*. Until this misinformation campaign has ended, I don't expect Bitcoin to improve, and apparently neither did Mike Hearn.
Bitcoin Classic isn't the answer, it is only a first step.

So your argument is basically "0.2% confidence is better than 0 confidence".  That doesn't fly: this is reality, where 0.2% confidence is effectively zero confidence. I don't have any confidence in a transaction with 0.2% chance of not being reversed - not a fifth of a percent of confidence, I have zero confidence in it. Actually, I have zero confidence in a transaction with a relatively high 15% chance of not being reversed. Until that number is closer to 75, I have no faith *at all* the transaction is secure. As a human I might not require the 99.99999% confidence levels expected by scientific rigor, but as an economic participant I do expect something much better than a tiny fraction.
As confirmation time and block difficulty approaches zero, confidence in those blocks approaches zero. A 1 confirm transaction on a one-second-block chain is *totally unreliable* - it *is effectively zero*. One (or even ten!) simply is not enough, it is the same as zero to a user. The amount of effort required to overturn those few blocks is so trivial that the block alone is not providing any confidence in its contents. Remember that the only security confirmation provides is a level of assurance that the transaction won't be reversed, and that assurance is *directly* related to the difficulty of block production. This hurdle to double spending is only as significant as the block production difficulty - again, as difficulty approaches zero, confidence in confirmations approaches zero.
Ten minutes may not be "optimal" - actually, statistical analysis suggests that six minutes would be - but Bitcoin has operated with a ten minute target time for years, and it functions well enough that adjusting it now causes more harm than good.

That argument would hold weight if the same PR was submitted to core. Still, that doesn't matter, as you say:


As do I. It's just a troll PR, and just as unbecoming behavior of bitcoin leadership as I have come to expect. Mike Hearn literally throwing a fit, taking his toys, and going home? Luke-Jr pushing troll PR's against competing implementations? Peter Todd committing fraud against Reddit and Coinbase? This just falls right in line with systematic slander, censorship, name-calling, straw men, accusations, ad hominem attacks, and authority abuses that I've come to expect.


A hard fork deployment is a process; I'm suggesting the process start immediately. The method for safe hard fork is in place and warning time is built into that method. Whether the hard fork is coordinated by the core developers or not is irrelevant; the method for determining fork consensus is baked into the protocol.
I also find the necessity of warning time somewhat humorous, given the historical successes and failures of previous upgrades to the protocol and the current discussion climate. As long as signed transactions still work, even people "out of the loop" will not suffer any disastrous consequences from having their node forked off the network. I think this theoretical group of people is at a greater risk if the network continues to approach capacity.
It's not like 2MB blocks are going to come along and BitPay won't be ready to process them because they didn't know what was happening. Honestly, who still needs to be warned, and why will that take longer than it takes for miners to see enough versioned blocks and supportive nodes to get the confidence to attempt to compute and broadcast a big block? The reward for doing it is pretty minimal (maybe 0.5 BTC in extra fees per block, on a busy day) so it's not going to be something that any miner will do haphazardly.

A "standard" key-hash address (i.e. a public key hashed twice to create an address) has a script that requires "standard" verification, and the command to do this is represented by a one. Other types of scripts that perform different verification (such as multi-signature) begin with a different command, which is represented by a 3.

When I send bitcoins, I know that I had the bitcoins, and there were no debts against the bitcoins that could cause them to be reversed. I know the recipient has a guarantee that the transaction is irreversible in a very short period of time. I don't have to rely on a central issuer or third party mediator that would charge extortion-level fees to make it happen and best of all, the only person I have to trust with security is myself.

Sure, you bring up a slew of very valid points but they all revolve around a simple basic truth:
If your startup idea involved holding funds for customers (in any currency), you were already required to abide by New York's FinCEN/AML/KYC regulations if you wanted to do business with New York residents, and the BitLicense is just one similar step in the process. If your startup won't hold customer funds, you don't need a BitLicense anyway.
Bitcoin innovators were already facing this type of regulation; now it's clear what needs to be specifically done with respect to bitcoin. Nobody expected to be able to operate an unregulated US-based exchange service of any type because the law *already* required licensing for it; now the licensing for bitcoin-specific activity is made clear and innovators that feared being shut out of their industry by future regulations have a road map of how to proceed.
Sure, a separate "BitLicense" on top of a traditional MTL makes no sense, but at least now people know if they will need it which lifts the barrier to innovation that's been in place here in the US for years.
Sure, the license isn't cheap; but neither are the ~~federal and~~ state money transmitter licenses. Let's face it: if you need a BitLicense to do business in New York, you either have enough capital to get one or don't have enough capital to launch at all.

The introduction of multisig doesn't change anything. A Mycelium user has sole control over their coins, without multisig. BitLicense specifically addresses businesses that hold and control coins for customers.

This is a poorly thought-out idea. Fees serve a crucial purpose to the bitcoin network - specifically, they prevent things like this from being effective.
Your desired use-case as described is nothing more than network abuse. There is no gain to moving your coins repeatedly, and every time you do it is another transaction that requires processing. If you aren't paying the processing fees to the network, you won't get the desired results.
If you want to hide the location of coins, use a mixer service.

It's not fancy and doesn't support complex orders (stops, limits, etc.) but it is effective and virtually zero-cost. Market makers pay no fee, and market takers pay 0.25% fee so it's a great deal.
The UI is pretty lacking - I really want a candlestick chart and scrolling through the orderbook or trade history would be very useful - but it gets the job done. All the necessary tools are there.
I haven't tried the API, partially because I'm not interested in bot trading, but mostly because API access to my coins scares the bajeebus out of me.

Bing search doesn't qualify as "other tech" because their front page and algorithm are different. They're the same tech as Google, implemented differently. Your altcoin is still an application of blockchain technology, not "other" technology.
Altcoins are not "other tech". They're the same technology with a different implementation. 9001 cloned shitcoins plague the exchanges right now and only a scant few of them even *claim* to offer some sort of new application of blockchain technology.
The moment an altcoin has something of *demonstrable* value to offer to the ecosystem, it will be taken seriously by the bitcoin community. Until then, we will look at the Ripples, Counterparties, and Mastercoins with a huge grain of salt. Turing-complete scripting sounds good on paper, but is it actually useful to business in practice? Decentralized domains would be nice, but it requires a total rebuild of the existing DNS system (or a hackish plugin for your browser). A more-anonymous coin has curb appeal, but how many merchants prefer an untraceable currency when their government requires they practice consumer identification?
Most altcoins are either self-professed pump and dump shitcoins, or are attempting to find a problem to solve. Either way, it's a failed formula for innovation. If you want a successful altcoin, find a problem that needs solving first, *then* find a way to solve it with a blockchain. Throwing blockchains at every idea we have is not going anywhere fast and the one blockchain that wasn't designed to be an improvement on anything, Bitcoin, is the one being taken seriously by the world.

The way lawyers pick apart legislation like this is almost always by going after the definitions - or finding loopholes within them. The way I read this, it is possible to argue that Bitcoin falls under the definition of "Gift Card" under 202.2(f). Specifically, Bitcoin meets all seven definitive requirements:
* Bitcoin is an electronic payment device
* Bitcoin is usable at multiple, unaffiliated merchants or service providers
* Bitcoins are issued for specified amounts
* Bitcoin does not necessarily require, but does allow the potential for, reloading (via address reuse)
* Bitcoins are honored upon presentation (signing/spending)
*  Bitcoin does not necessarily require, but does allow the potential to, redeem for the payment mechanism used to obtain it
Therefore, Bitcoin is a Gift Card under 202.2(f) - thus, it is *not* Virtual Currency under 202.2(p)(iii)(3). Or, so the argument goes.
Of course, in the real world a gift card always has a central issuer that will uphold the requirements of 202.2(f)(iii)-(vi) - this is where the definition falls short. Now, I heard this was a problem the first time, so how about this instead:




This language would explicitly exempt decentralized electronic payment devices from being Gift Cards by specifying they have a centralized authority and limited scope of redemption. It also closes a loophole where a gift card wouldn't be a Gift Card under the law if it doesn't have a "specified amount", or represents a good or service instead of a value.
Or, I could be totally nuts. I'm not a lawyer, I just play one on TV. (bracing for downvote army)

Gavin has already proposed a block size increase of 20x which would allow bitcoin to handle far more transactions than VISA does right now. After a stress test, he discovered no adverse effects against the network when facing 200 transactions per second.

Right - federal MSB application is free. Still, this is a proposed state law, so let's compare apples to apples. New York already has money transmitter licensing, and BitLicense is basically a second license to do it with bitcoin. Sure, I can't say that's ideal but it's better than having no legal framework at all, and it does treat crypto pretty similarly to "traditional" money.
I agree the fee is steep, but it isn't completely unreasonable to expect a startup that is sending significant amounts of money to people, to have enough to cover this fee. I can't really see why this is unexpected; after all, if you don't track your customers you are basically a money laundry.

202.2(p) does.


digitally stored value.
Testnet coins are neither a medium of exchange nor a form of digitally stored value (they're only a tool). Mainnet coins are both.
Notice that Testnet coins don't qualify as Gift Cards either - they don't fit 202.2(f)(v) since they cannot be honored.

There's an exemption for services exactly like ChangeTip, and it's in the definitions under 202.2(q)(1):


amount of Virtual Currency
Heck, I'd call this the "ChangeTip carveout". If the service isn't designed to facilitate commerce, and doesn't support large-value transfers, then it's exempt. I can only think of one service industry that fits the criteria, which is electronic tipping. Sure, the definition of "nominal" is debatable but I think that the $5000 application fee helps set a high bar for that definition - after all, if "nominal" is $5, then how can an operation that handles less than $5000 be expected to comply?
I freely admit I could be totally wrong about how I read this, but it just seems like there's a whole lot of smoke and not as much fire when it comes to BitLicense criticism. Not to say there aren't significant issues, but I get the impression this thing isn't entirely boneheaded after all and does stand a chance of becoming something acceptable to both crypto enthusiasts and Big Business Suit-Types.
