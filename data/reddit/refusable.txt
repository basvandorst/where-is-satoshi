Fuck bitcointalk, bitcointalk is not significant. I know many internet users who will not go to some stupid forum powered by slow ass software.

Predicted future value is a part of stock price. Tesla is an example. They (investors) expect Tesla to have a LOT more sales in 5 years so the stock price skyrocketed.

Baseball cards. If you had $100mil worth of baseball cards and left it off a BK filing you would go to jail. Even if you had $100mil in monopoly money. ($100m after exchanging to government currency)

What incentive would the original owner have to keep track of old "lost" bitcoins?

It depends if the price in Bitcoins is fixed to another currency or not. If someone sells an item for 1 bitcoin, the listed price in bitcoins may or may not fluctuate with the cost of a bitcoin in dollars.

He had 29 ATM transactions!

Exactly. If whatever you are selling isn't worth 1 cent.... then its a fucking waste of time. Anything that is anything costs more than 5 cents these days.

Thanks, I will post there if this one fails :)

He is now forced to buy more bitcoin in order to spend these, or buy more bitcoin in order to pay a fee and cash out. Unless he already has some OP just gave this guy about $0

Well my goal is to setup a mining pool that has all the features of all the big ones and then advertise it heavily to bring in a lot of users. Do you have any idea how to figure out bandwidth and processor requirements based on the hash rate?

Insurance sure as hell would not cover something where you send someone bitcoins and were scammed. Insurance doesn't cover that today.

Just charge a little more. At least make it worth a day or two of doing bitcoin faucets.

People just need to understand that there will be price fluctuations for a long time. A simple investment or sale of 10,000 bitcoins is going to change the price significantly in an instant.

It is huge, but the main difference is that it will be a part of other businesses, like you can fund ZipZap as CVS through a bill pay service.
