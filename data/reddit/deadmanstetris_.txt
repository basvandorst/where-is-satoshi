Can't be too careful! I've had my nano for a while now and ordered direct from ledger

Hi it's me, your friend.
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:54:19
I honestly don't care about dips. I just want Bitcoin to succeed and not be overthrown by something as ridiculous as Bcash
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:40:48
Try local bitcoins
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:35:57
Lost coins can never be recovered. If the day comes that they can then all of our coins would be compromised
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:07:05
I'm sure we had that question a couple of months ago. But while it was on the way up lol
@_date: 2017-12-21 08:33:59
And I recently sent 2 Litecoins to my ledger, approx worth £500 with a transaction fee of £0.06 insane. 
I believe there are good things to come with bitcoin, LN for one. Until then the best thing to do is just hodl

I knew exactly what clip it was from the thumbnail haha I was hoping someone would eventually show this. Would love to hear her thoughts today
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:17:46
I cannot begin to understand how it must feel to lose that kind of money it's like one of the only things that could give regular people a chance at a life of luxury. And there probably thousands of people out there that have lost coins as well. I wouldn't have a clue personally how I could get over it if it was me, I'd never forgive myself.
So sorry for your loss and your post might actually help a few people, maybe even save a life still.
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:24:01
Fuck that. Bitcoin should get its own keyboard icon!
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:17:23
Holy cow. Mega congratulations you have become 'The Moon!' for many many people. Thank you for your generosity. This has truly got to be the most amazing thing to come from Bitcoin to do some good in this world.
@_date: 2017-12-17 10:45:43
Hey OP, instead of doing a giveaway to us strangers who may already own a little bitcoin and are reasonably educated on the subject, put small amount into paper wallets and give them to friends for Christmas and educate them on bitcoin and hodl! Spread the awareness brother!
@_date: 2017-12-26 03:20:38
82350 USD = 1BTC

Banking on Bitcoin - Netflix 
I should've mentioned for those interested! Someone else has commented where it's from
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:04:17
Technically yes they should count towards the total market value but it's impossible to find out how many are lost because the blockchain doesn't know they are lost coins because they are still in a wallet and the blockchain has no way of knowing the owners have lost the private keys or seed.
@_date: 2017-08-31 15:28:19
Yeah it's disposable income that I'd easily spend on a night out, not that I go out much these days anyway. I just put £100 in bitcoin as I saw a little dip and took the opportunity, it's already on its way back up again. I'll probably leave it as a form of savings as it will probably do better here than in the bank! I'm not looking to get rich but if my money is better elsewhere then I'd rather that.
Thanks to everyone for the replies to my noob post!
@_date: 2017-08-31 12:50:53
If I bought now and it dips tomorrow then I wouldn't pull out at all. It's £100 I'm willing to lose. I'll just be annoyed that I didn't wait till then to purchase! But saying that no one can know if and when it's going to dip.
I just wondered if £100 is enough for a good potential return in 5-10 years time at today's rate which will give me 0.02btc
@_date: 2017-11-10 10:39:28
Hit 0.1 yesterday! Sadly a whole coin for me may never come. 
Every 0.1BTC for me is kind of like levelling up in a game with XP. Each 0.1 increment is going to cost more and more over time. 
If the opportunity ever comes for me to buy a whole coin then I'm going to go for it.
Congrats by the way
@_date: 2017-11-11 00:15:08
And the rest...
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:28:26
Hodl me OP I'm scared

I'm hoping for a future where I can seamlessly convert my Bitcoin to Litecoin for every day spending. 
Bitcoin - savings account
Litecoin - spending account 
Hoping I'll never have the need to convert to fiat 
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:01:18
Hopefully it drops to $750 then I can buy a whole coin!
@_date: 2017-11-03 04:47:02
There's quite a few listed as new and sealed by trusted sellers that's what got me tempted. I'm from UK so allthingsdecentral is out the question. What is mfg?
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:16:16
You can get your BTC back if you lose your device and it's extremely easy as long as you wrote down and kept your recovery seed in a safe place.
Keeping the recovery seed safe is more important than keeping the hardware safe
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:10:16
Congratulations! Sometimes you have to take the profits and do what is best for your family. Starting a family debt free is a fantastic way to make use it and any profit is better than no profits. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:27:10
I don't own much Bitcoin but its what I'm willing to lose if it all goes tits up. Just hold for the long run buddy, this time next year you will look back and be glad you didn't fold.

Withdraw the 4 bucks and buy yourself a beer ��
@_date: 2017-11-20 22:04:30
I use coinbase purely for convenience. I know the fees are a bit high but it's just easiest for me right now. Then I just send them straight to my ledger nano s
@_date: 2017-11-18 19:12:25
I love people
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:14:43
Very pleased with my ledger nano s. Easy to setup and use. But as said BOTH are good hardware wallets. I leaned towards the ledger as they support the other coins I have and they are currently working on support for Monero which I'm pleased about
@_date: 2017-11-12 15:55:14
Same here. Coinbase has got issues currently
Just got to wait it out
@_date: 2017-11-18 18:52:22
If you damage or lose your ledger you can restore it on another device or compatible wallet using your 24 word recovery seed you write down when you first set it up
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:00:16
Either way it will recover and exceed harder than before
@_date: 2017-11-12 15:56:13

Wow for those saying they have accepted this for a few years, I did not know this! I'll certainly be buying my next PC build from here! Maybe not today or for a while but it will be my go-to place!
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:17:03
It is rising..
@_date: 2017-11-10 08:14:29
Congratulations! Unfortunately for me I may never get there if the value keeps increasing the way it has been 0.1 here and hodling!
At least I can be part of the 210million club! Not as prestigious but still a milestone
@_date: 2017-11-07 13:29:11
I'm in the same situation as the OP. I was considering leaving my bitcoin in Coinbase to let them deal with it all but by the looks of that link, Ledger will be able to handle it in a user friendly way?
I don't understand why anyone would not want to split their coins and just stay commited to one chain, or is there a viable advantage I am missing there?
I got my ledger nano s today and done a test transfer. I was sitting on the fence whether to leave my coins on coinbase till after the split but I'm starting to lean towards sending it all to my nano today.
@_date: 2017-11-20 13:49:55
When it goes to 10+k and then dips to 9k?
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:37:55
That's unfortunate as I was excited to buy pc parts in the future. Looks like the best bet will convert back to fiat for the safest option 
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:05:50
Haha don't rub it in. Back then I was aware of Bitcoins.. due to their place on the dark net markets. I can't dwell on it right now so as they say the second best time to buy in is now! 
To be completely honest back then I didn't realise how I could make a wallet and securely buy bitcoin. And I think it's the reason it isnt adopted mainstream yet even though I do know the processes involved now. I often think if I could tell myself 7 years ago to invest in bitcoin, I'd be a millionaire. But we can only think about "what if" and take actions TODAY
@_date: 2018-02-06 05:36:24
So it's confirmed Bitcoin is king! It clearly controls all the market trends now not just in crypto! 
Bitcoin is the new financial benchmark
@_date: 2018-02-01 13:46:32
I used to gamble alot on sports and lottery. Now I have stopped I have spent approximately HALF the money I used to so I'm still up what I was before plus crypto seems a much better gamble than lottery for spare cash. I'm in it for the long haul till hopefully the day comes where I will never have to convert back to fiat. 
Fingers crossed eh?
@_date: 2017-09-02 16:10:03
@_date: 2018-02-01 13:37:58
Are you that guy that is waiting to say "I told you so" at the first opportunity then?
@_date: 2017-09-02 19:30:42
It would be great if it crashes so I could buy more! I'm in it for the long haul. I hope it crashes so I can afford 5 shiny coins and then ride the waves for 10+ years
@_date: 2018-02-02 12:19:53
Crash crash crash! Come on I would love to be able to buy a whole bitcoin! Still up from what I'm hodling but wouldn't be displeased if it dropped further to buy in again. It doesn't seem to be slowing down yet
@_date: 2017-09-02 16:03:29
I just buy BTC directly on coinbase with my debit card
@_date: 2017-10-13 10:15:02
I've just stayed away from it for the bad reviews. Which is a shame really because I need to get my coins out of coinbase before the fork
