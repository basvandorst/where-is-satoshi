Silly human. They didn't fail.

We would all be a lot happier if we just split into two networks.

Be careful what you wish for. It just might come true.

I don't understand the drivechain argument. They seem to want to put the enforcement of sidechain-to-mainchain withdrawals completely on the miners. What specific incentive do miners have to enforce the rules? I just don't see it.

I don't see anything wrong with the product, but it is being advertised wrong. You have to wait just as long to open a payment channel as you do for a normal on-chain transaction. So this doesn't save you any time, unless they are also hosting a central payment channel that works with all major bitcoin accepting merchants. And that would be a central point of failure. I wouldn't use that on principle.
@_date: 2016-03-01 17:52:57
Agreed. But this isn't a stress test. This is real transaction volume. These mempool levels shouldn't be a surprise to anyone. They were predicted well in advance.
@_date: 2016-03-01 06:33:45
Thank you for being a voice of reason.

maaku7, I see how it would be possible to do safe, trustless altcoin trades between blockchains that support lightning channels. This is rather exciting. You pointed this out 3 months ago. Do you know if there are any implementations in the works?
@_date: 2016-03-05 18:09:12
I think you're wrong. It is about throughput. It was irresponsible of miners and core devs to allow the mempool to fill up the way it did last week.
@_date: 2016-03-02 19:07:47
I notice that nowhere in this proposal is a specific new difficulty drop algorithm detailed.
@_date: 2016-03-08 06:02:27
Could a very early adopter be selling out?
@_date: 2016-03-01 14:58:36
It has been said many times, right now most of the miners aren't prioritizing transactions properly and it's basically random.

Greg Maxwell disagrees with Luke on this:

I don't understand. Is this anti-blockchain FUD?
@_date: 2016-03-01 15:18:08
I do not consider this spam. I consider this a message from someone who owns 3738 bitcoin, and by that virtue has a strong interest in the future success of the currency. Message may have been sent via blockchain because he was banned from this sub.

I try very hard to have rational debates with the other side, because I want to understand their point of view. But reddit is a very difficult place to do that.

Are you Satoshi?
@_date: 2016-03-01 06:02:43


This is demonstrably false. Blocks have not been full until now.

I think you're wrong. I think it is all about block size. Segwit will help but it is not enough and comes too late. Also Segwit caused an unintentional fork on the testnet yesterday so the April release date is still tentative.
@_date: 2016-03-03 02:40:32
It's really neat that you put all this work into the analysis.  But I'm not worried. When the halvening comes, just hold your breath like you're going through a tunnel. (The miners are actually spending less on electricity than 50% of their revenue.)
@_date: 2017-03-07 02:40:36
AntPool wy is also signaling BU

If the block size limit was larger, then spam attacks would be ineffective, so yes.

There it is. June 8, 2011. The price rocketed up from around 20 to around 30. Went down gradually over the next few weeks. Required minimum fee then was .01. 
@_date: 2016-03-02 14:48:23
You think that's bad? When I bought my first bitcoin in 2011, fee was 25 cents!

This would be great if it actually got adopted. But what is the plan? Just ask the pools nicely to give up their power?

No. They don't. Where did you get this ridiculous notion? Oh wait, I bet I can guess.

There appears to be a danger here in the federation of exchanges. A new exchange is usually at a volume disadvantage. What incentive would existing exchanges have to let a new exchange into their federation? Isn't this a barrier to entry?

If the hash of the UTXO is recorded in a block, and every node that verifies that block checks the hash against their copy of the UTXO at that block height for validity, then that sounds pretty secure to me. You wouldn't have to do this every block, just once a month or so. Your node downloads the UTXO torrent style from peers and checks hash against the one recorded in blockchain, and you're good to go.

It would be decidedly unfair to the people who have invested millions into mining to suddenly pull the rug out from under them by switching the POW algorithm. Yes it has been discussed and overwhelmingly rejected.

More transcript: 
"We knew at some point we were going to have to deal with the scalability limitation, and we've been thinking for the last six years, when, and how, and all those sorts of things. So, I think, what's going on right now with the threat of a hard fork and the fees rising dramatically, it's shifted that to the front of the priority queue at Bitpay. And so, I think, over the course, you're going to see some really exciting things come out of Bitpay related to off-chain payments. And as I mentioned before, just because they're off-chain doesn't mean they lose some of their essential properties, like privacy and such. We have some ideas that **aren't lightning network** that we think have a lot of promise, and we might do some experimentation with, and that don't even require a change to the protocol.
And that's the other thing. If the concern among miners is that, if you activate Segwit then you activate all this off-chain stuff, well, what I would tell miners is: that's going to happen. **Segwit doesn't have to get activated**. It's happening. We're building software that's the number one thing we're working on right now at Bitpay is building software that allows our payments to happen off-chain. And we don't need any changes to the protocol to make that happen."

Yesterday BTCC mined a large number of 731kb blocks. 
@_date: 2016-02-25 16:23:25
Sadly, you are mistaken: the blocks are full. Real users are experiencing unacceptable delays. The red line has been hit. Segwit is too late.
@_date: 2016-02-29 05:00:15
I thought this was a very fair and balanced discussion.

This is undeniable. I am now leaving coins on coinbase for the first time ever for fear of transaction fees.

Because the block size limit is too small.

That depends. Will a private jet violate your parole?
@_date: 2016-02-29 17:02:45
Can you elaborate on the tradeoffs? Seems like a win-win to me. And yes, it would still be possible to calculate UTXO the old way, so clearly this is a soft fork.
@_date: 2016-02-25 14:52:15
Andreas Antonopoulos, you are a brilliant guy. I bought your book. Work on LN is a good thing, but to state absolutely that "LN is a great solution to scaling" is overreaching. I recommend you seek out and consider arguments for and against with an objective eye.
