I will have to give it some time I guess, seeing that I just started anything bitcoin related in October this year.  I started in crypto last december with Dogecoin as my foundation to build on so I wasn't sure of the vibe over here.

Thank you very much!  I will have to keep my chin up and stick around to get the vibe of this group.

I feel like such an idiot... Thank you for at least not obliterating my question into smithereens and calling me out on being so stupid haha.
Thank you for the tip also!  Good to be a part of the community I hope that it treats me well here.

Man alive, I have been mining with gridseeds on litecoin and other scrypt and have like 3 bucks after 30 days with them.  A buck fifty in 1 day is amazing!
On the plus side since I don't have much in a tipping account Upvotes for everyone!

I know its a few hours later, but what is this "Gentlemen" referring to?  I know what the actual English definition is, but I am not sure what it what it is making reference.

I was so lost about what that meant.  I am still a n00b at Reddit/Bitcoin and had been scouring everywhere I could to find something about it.  I had no clue why this thread was using it so much.

yea I read the FAQ and the sidebar before posting just to be safe but it seems that there are quite a bit of angry people collected in this subreddit, I guess that I will keep the fun stuff over at dogecoin =]
