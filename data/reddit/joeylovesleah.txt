If you can win them over maybe you can join them on their rounds like the Jehovah's Witnesses thread guy said he would do. I wonder what ever happened to him. He was fun.

The value is about demand. There needs to be enough demand from consumers to drive purchase for either use as a currency or long term storage, enough demand to create a fight for available coins to drive the price up. No one likes to hear this but the killer app is drugs and there isn't enough demand for that to use up all the the coins for sale on any given day. Each state that legalizes pot has the potential to reduce value in my opinion. I'm going to assume you disagree with all or most of what I believe.

Locating a suspect means amassing as much data as possible to verify other data. It's helpful.

Always a good show when everyone comes out to play. This sounds like a pitch for merchants and most of us visitors are consumers. There is a disconnect between the message being sent and the audience its reaching. Just an observation.

Who are you kidding.  Saddam would have embraced bitcoin and been your hero if he hadn't been hanged.
