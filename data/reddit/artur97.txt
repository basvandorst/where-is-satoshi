What do you think about alternative p2p exchanges like [Hodl Hodl]( How can they expand to Venezuela?
The fees there are less than on Paxful or Localbitcoins, plus less risk for the users, since the exchange itself doesn't hold user's funds (read "don't control them").
@_date: 2018-09-18 09:22:15
While we highly respect Localbitcoins, they’re still much closer to Bitstamp and Kraken in that they do have their own wallet — they have 100% access to all the bitcoins stored with them. Hodl Hodl is different in that we don’t have a wallet. Instead, we generate a Bitcoin or a Litecoin multisig address and 2 keys are required to unlock the funds. One key is stored with us while another one belongs to user and isn’t stored on our server ever. This means, that even if our servers are hacked, the hacker cannot get access to the funds locked in escrow as he would lack another key. This greatly reduces the incentive to hack the exchange and cease to be a honeypot which most exchanges are.
On the other hand, we wanted to stay as user-friendly as possible and avoid the hassle of asking users to install our software on their computers. That meant a decentralization trade off — unlike Bisq we are centralized, but we also offer a much smoother user experience.

The point is that for the US is enough to hear "Bitcoin" nearby the "US citizen/resident" to have a reason to start watching for the company.

@_date: 2019-06-03 14:50:30
In the ToS is mentioned, where the company is based.
@_date: 2019-06-03 12:10:46
Hodl Hodl doesn't hold the funds - during every trade funds are locked in the multisig escrow with 3 keys (one belongs to the buyer, one to the seller &amp; one to the Hodl Hodl), two of them are required for the release.
In case of dispute, Hodl Hodl signs the transaction either to the buyers side (along with the buyer), or seller (allong with the seller).
Thus, unilaterally the exchange cannot move the funds, since it has only ONE key (2 out of 3 needed for the release).
Did I answer your question?

Hi everyone, this is the official blog post about the Lightning support at 
Some things we want to highlight:
1&gt; Everyone will be able to try Lightning on the testnet version of our exchange testnet.hodlhodl.com at the start of May.
2&gt; Mainnet Lightning will be available at the end of May.
For those unfamiliar with our exchange:
Hodl Hodl is a global P2P Bitcoin exchange, that allows users to trade directly with each other and it doesn’t hold user’s funds — locking it in multisig escrow instead. This minimizes the possibility of crypto assets theft and reduces trading time.
The main difference between Hodl Hodl and other P2P cryptocurrency exchanges is that we do not hold user’s funds and do not have KYC/AML procedures. Hodl Hodl is also cheaper than most of the other P2P exchanges, with a maximum fee of 0.6% per trade.
Thanks for your support &amp; interest! We hope this feature will make the Bitcoin ecosystem better.

Many reasons, some of them:
* If you buy/sell super large amount on the centralized exchange - you move the price (and centralized exchanges prevent such price manipulations).
* KYC/AML procedures on the centralized exchanges
* Security: it's not the best idea to store large amount on the centralized exchange.
(that's not the full list, obviously)

If you want to buy coins using you local bank, you have to find the offer on our exchange with specific payment method (and maybe, in specific country), or create an offer by yourself. 
To do this, you can filter the offer list by payment methods or a country.

It’s not fully decentralized - the site can be put down, you’re right.
However, the funds will still be in safety, if this happens.

Hello everyone, my name is Arthur, I'm with Hodl Hodl. If you have any questions or want something to discuss, we can talk here.
Lightning contracts on  in the end of May!
For those unfamiliar with our exchange:
Hodl Hodl is a global P2P Bitcoin exchange, that allows users to trade directly with each other and it doesn’t hold user’s funds — locking it in multisig escrow instead. This minimizes the possibility of crypto assets theft and reduces trading time.
The main difference between Hodl Hodl and other P2P cryptocurrency exchanges is that we do not hold user’s funds and do not have KYC/AML procedures. Hodl Hodl is also cheaper than most of the other P2P exchanges, with a maximum fee of 0.6% per trade.
Thanks for your support &amp; interest! We hope this feature will make the Bitcoin ecosystem better.
