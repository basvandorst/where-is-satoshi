I've already downloaded Multibit, also backed up my wallet on a USB and the part where I'm stuck on is finding the a mining client for windows 7. I tried GUIminer but everytime I go to load the .exe file the icon appears for 10 seconds and disapeers then

Chris thankyou very much for the valuable information, So let me explain this is a trial run more than anything. I just want to understand the setup and how things work a little bit, I know my hardware isnt the best on this specific computer because this computer is my first test run before I put it on the upgraded equipment. Do you have a specific miner you recommend for Windows 7?
