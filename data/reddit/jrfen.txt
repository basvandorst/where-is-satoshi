Look up "salting passwords" and then "brainwallet hacking" for some insight on this.
In short the random key space is larger than the known universe... if people make vanilla private keys from passwords and they are unsalted - it reduces the keyspace to something you could get lucky at brute force cracking.

The BFL track record clearly no, their marketing channels is something else....  I think a peep show stripper would have had something more to show then BFL by now for any serious buyer orders.

I have never run my pi as a wallet but it handles multiple financial calculations in 1/10th of a second using arch.  Swap memory is only used during compiled times....  for a command line programming platform it is hard to beat at $30 + shipping...

Apply for a research grant.
Setup a pedicab business  or street market vendors with a bitcoin payment system in an area of international commerce.  Study the adoption and utilization.
Or find an area that uses bitcoin already.

yes, and most likely worth giving some serious debate and consideration to.... unless Kaminsky is being bought off by some lite / neo scrypt coiners

it would not cost a decent sized nation with some technical capabilities to create their own asics for their own purpose - control - destruction... whatever... that will have to be dealt with at some time and sooner is better than later.

it seems a bit early for myanmar but I heard a report on NPR a while back about one silicon valley guy who went back to his home country of myanmar to bring the internet of age via a travel agency... maybe he could offer bitcoin as a payment service
