You called warren buffet an senile old man and now you are trying to change the discussion. I don't have any respect for anything you have to say after that. Im going to forget about you in two minutes and he better for it.

Are you seriously talking shit about Warren Buffet? His toenail clippings have more investment savvy than you ever will.
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:47:25
Based on a two minute review of your comments, I will disregard everything you have to say ever. You are not a quant,

Blockchain is unstoppable. Bitcoin is, for all our hope and dreams very much in hand. I'm no chicken little, but don't be fooled into thinking this market isn't under the finger of the powers that be. Different powers, different bees. Hodl until it doesn't make sense. Fuck sake, at least get your dreams out before the sky does fall. Don't get me wrong, I am frantic cashing out my assets to buy as we speak. Daddy wants the dip, but I will sell the second I get mine.
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:40:46
They haven't come back in any sustainable way no. I'm making rig hand wages at a diesel shop, so it's no where near where it was. The crazy thing was that I was one of thousands of people cashing checks like that on any given day. Why knock over a back, hit Walmart.  
 Edit: bank duh.

Taking risks is inherently stupid. You don't spend money you don't have. At least smart people don't do that.
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:11:55
Doesn't mean I'm not liquidating my Roth to buy BTC as we speak. Roth did 18% five years running. Daddy wants the rocket. (I'm pulling half of it to buy no tthe whole damn thing.)
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:09:21
You might want to crunch those numbers again.
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:24:19
That does make this questionable.
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:13:28
I hope so. Then I can buy twice as much.
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:35:46
I understand that it's not what they mean.  By definition it's not a centralized system, but when you have a monetary system that can be easily influenced by whatever powers may be there is literally no difference. Everything is susceptible to corruption. This is no different, it's a step in the right direction.
@_date: 2017-12-02 21:34:33
That's literally how day trading works, by its very definition. "Buying the dip" isn't something that BTC invented. I can't even. Good luck out there.
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:16:18
Who bought at 19? I mean the moon and all I get it, but buying at peak is super risky.

Super newb, long time watcher. I want to by right now. How do I do it? My bank (Gate City) won't let me make an account with Coinbase, how do I buy?
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:03:43
When 40% of bitcoin is held by maybe a few thousand users, what makes you say that it is decentralized?
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:29:25
When I worked in the oilfield in Williston, ND I pretty commonly worked with numbers over $5,000 in cash transactions. I'm guessing they just new that the wages were hyper inflated and just didn't bother at the time. Before I got a bank account I would go cash $7,000 paychecks at Walmart and they didn't batt an eye.
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:02:18
Yes, thank you.
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:07:21
Ok so the word "literally" was used disengenuoisly. The fact is that there are entities that can influence the market vis a vis centralized for all intents and purposes. If you think limiting the amount of money a person can have or spend is impractical than you are product of the root of the problem. We are rapidly approaching late stage capatalism. When we get there it will produce pain and hurt like the world has never seen. Block chain can fix the system, with a few simple rules. It's only a fantasy if you want it to be. You have a very macob world view. The thing about being wrong is you rarely know that you are. Good luck out there.
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:03:08
The chances of it being worth a dollar are trillions of times more likely. There that's a reasonable way to use the words bit coin and trillions of dollars in the same sentence without sounding like a complete hack.
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:51:01
It's not "my definition", it's just the literal interpretation of what a centralized currency system is. That's also a pretty condesending way to try and say whatever it is your trying to say. You also seem to have a very tenuous grasp of what communism is. There is a simple way to fix the system. In simple terms, nobody is allowed to have or spend above a limit. Block chain is an integral part of how that system would work. It's not rocket arithmetic. You can talk down to me all you want, you may want to make sure your little towsies can touch the bottom of the pool before you dive in. Dealers choice bud.
@_date: 2017-12-02 21:29:46
You saved it at the end there.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:30:29
You are a fool or a fanboy or both. Doesn't matter to me. Blockchain is a revolution, bitcoin is a fucking word. I don't know what about buying it makes you think I'm panicking. The difference between you and me, is on the tail end I'll be rich and you will be hodling your dick.
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:53:44
I have been wanting to jump on the BTC train for six months. I just can't see my way past how useless it is. It has value for some reason that is far beyond my understanding. It's not good at anything besides buying coke on the internet. Someone explain to me how a pseudo currency that isn't good at even being currency has any fucking value. I keep expecting to wake up and see that it's worth $0.22 but it just keeps climbing.
@_date: 2018-05-26 23:50:05

You are a fan of a currency that is controlled by private entities that answer to no one? Bitcoin is an unregulated scam.

John McAfee said he would eat his penis of Bitcoin isn’t worth a million dollars by 2020. 
@_date: 2018-05-26 22:50:32
It’s far from an optimal system. Things like inflation shouldn’t exist, but they do because they want to keep lending (printing) money. I think bitcoin is a fucking scam, but the Fed is a scam too. It does some good and a lot of bad. 
@_date: 2018-05-26 23:14:42
Something like 40% of BTC is held by less than a dozen people. They could get together and decide to sell tonight and BTC would be worth a dollar tomorrow. You should understand this system you have so much faith in a little better.

Ya the dollar is worth more because people use it. 
@_date: 2018-06-09 22:37:22
Percentage wise sure, but people bought at 19k and lost half their life savings. I sold around 16 and haven't looked back. I like the idea of BTC but I'm going to stick with my Roth and retire at 55. BTC is to unstable and with the big dogs on wall street getting in I'm even less confident. It certainly has upward potential, but even dollar you by into BTC is a dollar not it your Roth. Nobody is buying lambos with their roth, but I will retire at 55 (2038).

I get it. This commodity has been very volitile and in a good way. I could see myself investing maybe 10% in it just for kicks. The problem is that 10% of my retirement nest egg is $300,000 that I can't afford to lose (at retirement not now obviously). It could be the moon but it could just as easily be nothing. There is a lot going on in crypto and more every day. Sears used to sell more mass market bullshit than anyone, they missed a beat and they are gone. It happens. I just can't. It's not stable. Good luck I'm rooting for you guys. Maybe one day but not today. 
@_date: 2018-06-14 17:19:03
A lot of people in this sub just have their head in the sand about some hard truths about Bitcoin. This article points out the truth that bitcoin can be manipulated. 
@_date: 2018-06-10 01:15:47
You are absolutely right. I need to shift a little percentage into crypto. I can't lose 10% but a 2% shot at the moon is a lot better than a 0% shot at nothing.

There is volitilaty in holding. It's money you could invest in something else that is proven to grow (Roth, 401k, bonds even). I got in on a whim because my friend was so sure and he showed me all these graphs and talked a very good game. I sold on the rocket and he held. He got in very cheap compared to me, but he wishes he sold to. When I sold every BTC I had he really waivered. He was going to sell half and decided against it. If he had sold he would have the money or twice the BTC now. It's not an endeavor in stamina. It's an endeavor to make money. I encourage you guys. It's exciting. I'm 35 and have two kids. I can't pour my retirement into a hope and a prayer. 
@_date: 2019-02-22 15:13:37
They are in their 70's and with the new corporate tax break/buybacks/bubble I moved them into gold. I just want their assets to be safe until they pass. I will move my inheritance back into the market when its mine. They wont outlive another crash so it seems like the responsible thing to do. 
@_date: 2019-02-22 15:03:10
My Roth is at 18%, as an average. 22% this year.  If you bought under 4k you are yielding around 8%  so I would argue that is a shitty investment. 
@_date: 2018-06-08 04:33:22
If you didn't sell anything on the rocket that's your fault. I dipped out at $16,500 and my wife drives an Escalade. It's no Lamborghini but...
@_date: 2019-02-22 14:18:20
I liquidated at 16k and I haven't  been wrong yet. 
@_date: 2019-02-22 14:17:15
I was going to say gold then I clicked. Gold is not fiat though. I have 30% of my assets in gold just because its stable. It took some convincing, but I convinced my parents to move most of their investments into gold because they may not outlive a market crash. Their money already did its work, they just need to live out another ten years on it. Gold is literally a rock. 
@_date: 2019-02-22 14:20:29
@_date: 2019-02-22 14:58:36
If we are talking in the next 20 years, zero. 20k was a fluke, it was market manipulation. I bought at 2,300 and sold at 16k laughing all the way to the bank. 
@_date: 2019-02-18 02:24:54
I wouldn't say that, but I'm not moving my savings into bitcoin any time soon. 
@_date: 2019-02-22 14:12:42
Well we know you are. 
@_date: 2019-02-22 15:20:44
Those people are lucky. Somebody spent millions of dollars worth of coins on a pizza. Nobody gave a shit about btc until it hit 20k. For all intents and purposes we should start there. You can dump your money into whatever you want. I'm going to stick with what has devoped into a very comfortable early retirement.
@_date: 2019-02-22 14:18:43
@_date: 2019-02-22 22:50:14
Oh I get it. I liquidated and used one coin to buy back. I'm currently sitting on a 4k profit. I gotta have some skin in the game or I just lose interest. Maybe it will go to the moon, maybe it wont. Chances are that I'll lose my wallet before either of those things happen. 
@_date: 2019-02-22 16:10:32
I love it when you guys use terms like bull and bear. Welcome to the world of money management. Good luck out there kid. 
@_date: 2019-02-22 22:13:53
If you look at the price of gold vs the value of the usd you will se that they move together. The early 80's demonstrates that. 
@_date: 2019-02-22 22:23:00
That's your choice. I paid off my house speculating that it wont go any higher. It's no Lamborghini but its $1,400 I don't have to pay every month. 
@_date: 2019-02-22 15:15:11
Well I have plenty of time. 
@_date: 2019-02-22 16:14:28
Um ok. Gold is the most stable investment. It doesn't grow, but it doesn't lose either. We aren't talking about short term gains here. We are talking about millions of dollars. They can lose 2% and its not an issue. They cant lose 20%. That would be an issue. I'm managing millions of dollars that are pertinent to my and my parents future. So...

BTC is a centralized system. 40% of coins are held by maybe a thousand people. Don't fool yourself into thinking this is something it's not. Blockchain is the future, but here we are warping it for our capitalist desires.

No you don’t, but when you’re a hammer everything starts to look like a nail. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:09:20
There is a very real possibility of the floor being around 2k. I'm not in the know any more than anyone else, but I'm not buying now.
@_date: 2018-03-02 00:33:45
Not even close. Also bitcoin is decentralized in-so-far as it isn't directly controlled by any one organization. It can be manipulated by any entity that holds enough coin to drive price. It's just as succeptible to corruption as any other monetary system. Don't go thinking it's something that it is not.

Ask your friend that invested in a Roth.
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:34:56
You realize that a market correction is 10% of the spike right? $2,000 BTC is still fucking awesome, but don't go thinking it's going back to 20k any time soon if ever. When it hits the floor I will buy back, don't get me wrong. 2k is the mark for me. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 04:57:22
I'm sure you sold at 20k right?
@_date: 2018-02-24 06:58:43
I'm pissed at myself I didn't buy at 6k. I thought it was going lower and it didn't.
@_date: 2018-02-15 03:38:58
Did you sell when it was over 15k?
@_date: 2017-09-18 00:34:04
Good luck arguing that against literally every banking firm in america.
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:19:59
BTC was worth $1,100 dollars one year ago. Are you dissapointed that it's only gained 800% of its value? I tapped out at $17,600. To the moon my fucking ass. I'll buy back at $2,000 or I'll just put it in my Roth. You obviously bought the bull and got the horns. Keep your coins, they won't be worth more than they are right now for a while. Don't invest what you can't afford to lose. It's like banging my head against a wall.
@_date: 2018-02-02 07:00:46

@_date: 2017-09-17 21:06:45
Bitcoin is a scam! You need to bank through us so we can charge interest coming and going. Oh and we invest more money than we have in very questionable endeavors. It's ok though. The republicans socialized the banking system in 2007 so we won't lose shit, that's for the stupid middle class taxpayers.

So if I offer you 10% less than your asking in cryoto you would accept it? I bought my house for $121,900. The asking was $189,000. I’ll be god damned if I didn’t get a steal on my cash USD. I’m not a mathmologist or anything so don’t quote me. 
@_date: 2018-07-21 16:01:45
This is it really. My best friend is huge on crypto. He basically forever me to buy are $3,400 and when I sold at $16,500 he was furious with me. Jokes on him, I bought a Honda Accord and a lambo sticker. To this day I don’t care about crypto, but I’m glad he brought me in that one time. Now he is all about Monero or something. He will talk me into buying a few coins eventually just because of what happened last time. Still doesn’t mean I care about crypto. 
@_date: 2018-07-07 00:05:46
My portfolio has been outpacing inflation for a while now. The difference between BTC and the dollar is that almost nobody cares about BTC and a LOT of people care about the dollar. I remember a few years back the American government did everything they could to protect the dollar. If BTC crashes almost nobody will care. I ain’t hatin’ just statin’. I hold a few coins myself, I ain’t buying.
