You are gonna be a rich man in &lt; 6 months

Quick side note, be careful where you get your hardwallet because a lot of sites could be set up to get wiped and steal coins transferred. 50k is a sizable amount so be safe

I side by this. I am not stressing at all that it’ll go past ath again. It will again pick up traction and all the FUD and bears will clear the way.

I said this on another post about Africa. Africa is a huge and upcoming economy. Bitcoin has potential to make crazy changes in an underdeveloped area like this and Venezuela.

A lot of people commenting don’t understand the power Africa actually has.. huge upcoming economy with a great population, crypto could really change day to day life there.

Once it’s bullish there’s no going back, imo 6k is a great buy
@_date: 2018-07-11 03:52:04
Think what you want. Sideways for a month then the momentum will take off. 6k is strong resistance.
@_date: 2018-07-11 03:49:21
It can turn bullish at any moment now.
