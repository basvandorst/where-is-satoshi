i agree, i dont think that the blockchain tecnology is a bubble. but it is so huge that a lot of project, currencies or other situations can be scam or bubbles

lol, did not thought about this way. but probably he is exposing himself as a target. lol

everything is the importance and connotation we give to them. but the tecnology behind it, not just the bitcoin, is very promising
@_date: 2018-05-22 19:37:51
what artificial inteligence understands the tecnology better than us. :D

my first days on crypto i literally attacked in front of the screen refreshing and controlling the candles and everything else. now i have learned this are normal phases of the market, so i dont bother myself so much anymore.

i regret i could was not able to had the information to had some coins in the past you are showing. congratulations on your family, and the minivan is the best choise

this is a very good pointing out. the market is unpredictable and absolutely not to trust anyone who has the truth about the price of any cryptocurrency
@_date: 2018-05-16 22:04:01
that is true. even if your card is ok, and is usable for other purposes, for buying in crypto it can be blocked
@_date: 2018-05-22 19:36:40
probably because of high fees and long time to confirm, it was not sustainable any more. other cryptocurrencies and blockchains can fit better on this purposes

thanks for the answer. coinbase has the monopolio almost, but in a decentralised world hopefully will not last for long time

i dont think i will sell at all. in this situations i always hold. and if i see that the market is going some point down that after has to recover, i buy something in order to sell what it goes again up. but never sell in a bearish market

6 is the perfect number? :)

until now bitcoin can give the possibility to create your own chain and experiment it without the fear to fail and with no hurry. so this way one can deliver the best product available

the tecnology is becoming more acknowledged every day and more is about to be recognised
@_date: 2018-06-02 15:36:38
welcome to the club!!! nothing we can do about that unfortunately.

this is a good for the investitors that have some experience, but not so good for the new ones. big wealthy people act like whales and can manipulate the market on their wishes
@_date: 2018-06-02 15:13:59
exactly my thought. there should be something to relate on, or at least to compare on. otherwise there is no point at all
