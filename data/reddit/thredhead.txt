 Descending Triangle. Can see the underlying support line. And.. where it broke.. and where it is thus far failing to get above. Note wedging price before the attempted recovery to upside price action. Looks sketchy.

Doesn't matter if I try to move or shake the trend lines. Look what is happening. Bitcoin trying to stop the rot.
This chart is a slightly shorter time frame. Notice how price bounces off the lower down sloping trend line. Price needs to gain traction on an up trending line as indicated by chart. It's not a bubble in the true sense of the word until price breaks below the base of marked lower up trending line. Then.. it will be carnage if that occurs. GL &amp; You are welcome. :)  look for reversals off the lines kiddos. Always play to win. There's no participation awards lol

Recap on BTC.. Broke Descending Triangle (major high pattern formation) which is a Bearish pattern.. then tried yesterday to re-enter the pattern and failed. 
Bad bad bad. Watch for those checkpoints below on the Bitcoin chart I posted yesterday. Don't be foolish and hold on into the dirt if she gives way. A lot of mums and dads sucked into the hype. Not good.

The words of someone who has no idea how to trade. Good luck "guessing" then. My process has been back tested over and over again. Are you watching the chart? Target for at least a temporary bounce is the red up trending line. She broke a key support line and is now tanking. Let's see where she goes shall we?..
@_date: 2018-01-20 18:40:16
Let's just recap for a second. Price was wedging. Yes it was. When it breaks it will move swiftly. Yes it did. Price was sitting at a critical point on the chart (you may not be able to see this I get it). Just because I thought the up moves looked weak (the market doesn't care for your opinion..) when the wedge broke up you buy. That's how you make $. If you were buying the wedge. You were gambling. The breakout constitutes a winning trade. 
I'm not replying to anybody directly with this comment. What I am saying is know when to buy and know when to sell. Don't hope. There's a reason I drive a Ferrari. All the best.
@_date: 2018-01-21 00:01:28
One last thing to consider. Bitcoin chart (since the epic launch up) has formed a Descending Triangle pattern. This is a Bearish pattern. A pattern which shows her inability to make continued new Highs.. The real test for Bitcoin will come at ~$14k. If she can't break back above there and move UP.. you will find out pretty quickly how dumb you are for holding on for dear life. Be aware. Trade wisely. I know most won't care and that's cool too. Have fun with it. If she does push up and break.. hold.. move up.. then she is legit. Chart says caution overall. Investors are lazy. Traders are smart. Don't hand it all back if she shits the bed.
@_date: 2018-01-19 20:09:24
You will notice that my numbers are very specific. Recent tail down to $9,200 was a test of lower. Market rejected that and pulled back up to support line. Following that.. price has tried to push higher on multiple occasions and has thus far failed to do so. Price is now wedging. That wedge will tighten until it breaks. When it breaks it will move swiftly. There isn't much buying support behind today's action. If today's candle closes ~$11k she's toast. Must hold the wedge pattern then break to the upside. Good luck. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 21:27:22
Bitcoin is giving the Crypto bulls a massive middle finger today......   half way down?..... be aware and be cautious ffs.

@_date: 2018-01-27 17:11:18
Looking better here. Holds above this up trending line and there's a nice potential overhead move brewing. If she was going under she would have done so by now. Plenty of support through that lower up trending channel. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 18:50:20
Updated Bitcoin chart. Watch for a bounce below if can't get back above by close today. Shit result but not entirely unexpected.  trade the trade.... fallout of Bearish pattern break. You can't expect (edit: Buyers) to keep lining up just to sell to others at a higher price. That has a name.. it's called "Greater Fool Theory".. and is a precursor of bubble behaviour. Needs to catch an up trending line. Not worth buying until it does. GL
@_date: 2018-01-19 19:47:53
Hey there. Technical trader here. Bitcoin is teetering on falling to ~$9,300 minimum. Current price action shows a wedge in price and a weak rally up. Be prepared for ~$9,300.. then if that doesn't stick.. ~$8,000 then if that doesn't stick.. ~$6,000. Bitcoin is on high alert atm. Gentle reminder to not fight the market. It either breaks up and runs or.. it breaks down and tanks.. again. So far my money is on the latter. Good luck.

Until Bitcoin moves up and breaks that Descending yellow line on chart.. back tests that break.. then moves above it you will not see an attack on Bitcoins all time high. Until she does this she is effectively pushing shit up a hill and may collapse at any time.
If she does the first you will see new highs. 
Today's price action is rubbish. She is rejecting the move and heading back to base of channel (drawn on chart).  She is AGAIN failing to move higher and challenge break down of Descending triangle
I hope somebody is paying attention to the validity of the channels and PA.

Hehe keep watching. I'm very good at this. Bought a chunk right on the base of Mr Red candle as it hit support before the bounce. Tight stop under ascending support line. How hard is it to buy the base of an obvious channel and ride the fucker up? Trading for Dummies. Sorry I've been trading stocks for years and this is what I do for a living. Trend trader. Breaks the line and it's a sell. Right now it's a buy the base of the channel. Simple. But everyone has their own methods.....

Regardless of the big pump and dump I think it was well executed. Bitcoin established its name as “Digital Gold”. A legitimate asset. Sure people got burned but that wasn’t the point. When the economy goes South as it always inevitably does.. money will flight to traditional and digital gold. It’s been manipulated perfectly. I mean you can argue it’s for money laundering but so is fiat. Bitcoin isn’t going anywhere so the sooner you stop hating on it the sooner you can take advantage of it.

@_date: 2018-06-29 18:19:29
There's nothing random about them. 
It's about finding consistent support/resistance points on the chart. All of the up trending lines are at the exact same angle. Price is either supported on a line or finds resistance in penetrating above these lines. You can see successful and failed tests of these lines throughout the chart if you look closely (and understand the concept).
The yellow line I call the initial blowoff trend line after all the fomo.. I bought BTC when it broke this line and successfully back tested the break the following day (i.e. did not fall back below it). I don't muck around so if an ascending channel breaks I cut and run on a small loss of that is what eventuates. Remember the old saying.. cut your losers short and let your winners run.
I am not of the HODL mentality. I'm a trader.
Remember it's not a profit until you sell. Forget about it's not a loss until you sell because it's still a paper loss with no ultimate guarantee of price recovery.
As you can see the lowest channel drawn is around ~$5k-$5,200 mark. Now I can't say it will definitely go there (as people rightly say you can't know for certain) but my eyes are certainly on it. If it breaks the red line however.. regardless of how low it goes or doesn't go.. BTC is a buy IMO and that's exactly what I'll be doing when it does. It's about playing the probabilities in your favour and the sooner you can understand how to read a chart with valid trend lines the better! :) 
There are other parts I can add to this chart but I didn't want to make it too crazy to understand. There are parallel support lines that also run through it.
The reason I believe price is likely to hit the base of this lower channel at ~$5,000-$5,200 roughly is because it's the next lowest valid ascending line from the initial parabolic move late last year.
I'd probably need to draw another chart to illustrate what I mean by that.
Forgetting the parabolic line chart for now as that's not really important.. the below shows a couple of things. Circles show where price is currently fighting for support.. and where there has been support previously (which validates them). The dotted line is where it needs to get back above to break out of this messy down trend.. but it needs to break back through these overhead channels first:
Currently BTC is putting in lower lows and lower highs. It needs to start by putting in a higher high.. then it can pull back for a higher low on a higher support line.. and break the trend back to the upside :)
@_date: 2018-06-29 03:32:11
I'm a technical trader and trade trends. I'm good at what I do. Unfortunately I was way late to the Crypto party as I focus on publicly listed companies not currencies. Anyway FWIW I bought on the break of the yellow line and rode that wave up after waiting patiently for the fomo to recede. Sold out before further shit hit the fan.. but.. if this fucker breaks the red line I'll be going in hard. Patience is your friend. I've had ~$5,800 as a support level for ages now.. and as you can see also around the ~$5k mark. 
What I'm trading and whether IT is ultimately successful is not my concern. Buying correctly and selling correctly is all that matters. Timing is everything when it comes to trading. Yesterday broke the support level &amp; today it's (so far) failing a Retest of that break. I'd expect price to find its way to that $5k mark.. the base of the lowest denoted channel on my chart. 
I know some people don't believe in TA and that's fine. But I make a living from it and it exists.. so.. good luck with whatever strategy you might use.

As I said earlier I generally trade publicly listed companies.. But my motto is "If it can be charted it can be traded" &amp; "You can't hit a target you can't see". 
Read about VSA (Volume Spread Analysis) would be my first suggestion. This will teach you about candle/bar charts; the price spreads of those candles (and what that means) and the relationship that Volume plays in respect of the above. Read about Support/Resistance levels and how to identify and validate them. 
Trading trends and following them until they break works for me but everybody is different and there is no one right or wrong method :) usually if a trend breaks down (even if only subtly) there is generally larger consequences to the down side coming. That's risk management for me. Take my profits and run because I can always buy it back again later. For every one that bucks the trend and keeps running without me there's at least ten that fail and fall.
Set trading rules and stick to them robotically.
Also you can play pattern setups like Cup and handle or various wedges etc that have upside breakout probability on your side. If you play a pattern that has a 70% chance of an upside break.. and that's the only pattern you trade.. well.. you will be successful!
Hope that's not too much jibberish.
@_date: 2018-06-13 15:10:29
Well technically since ATH price has formed a decending triangle which is a bearish continuation pattern. ~$6k then ~$4.6k are your watch levels. I wouldn't be rushing in to buy given how much supply remains overhead from so many that bought in much higher. And.. with low demand this all points to lower prices. $10k is long gone. It couldn't even Retest $8k before price shit the bed. Good luck &amp; be patient :) price is only now looking to head toward the capitulation zone. Will be watching the $5.8-$6k zone for support.

On the monthly chart when I draw in my trend lines $7,500 is definitely a key area of interest when it comes to price Support. It is too early to tell if there is a reversal in play over this timeframe. Honestly I’d have to watch shorter timeframes to get a better read on probability. Technically I believe it should hover around the $7,500 mark into this monthly close. It may look to test a move lower next month but if $7,500 sticks on the monthly close again by the end of next month.. then we could see a decent turnaround rally brewing.
Price could still get smashed well lower yet but in my opinion (and that’s all it is) there should be some fight in the dog for Support at $7,500.
On the hourly chart I can see a potential rally to $7,700 area as a descending trend line test (short term). If it breaks that number topside on volume then we may have the beginnings of a turnaround brewing.

Well it already broke down when it plummeted into the $8k’s from $10k area. Then there was a small pause and the breakdown then continued to target at $7.5k which was the height of the prior pattern. So we have reached the initial target now.
But.. that doesn’t mean we can’t go lower or that guarantees an immediate reversal either.
What we need to look for are signs of a reversal. A double bottom.. a descending neckline break.. prior trend line supports etc some sort of bullish reversal setup that indicates high probability of reversal from down trending price action into up trending price action.
Often at some point.. price will rally back to test the initial break down point. Check it’s validity if you like.

"Inherently, miners for Bitcoin and Ethereum want the cost of transactions on the ledger to be high to increase the reward they receive. This behavior drives up the cost of each transaction, rendering the digital asset less attractive for real-world use cases like payments.
This was not so apparent in the early days of Bitcoin because transaction fees were dwarfed by the block reward. However, as the block reward drops, the interests of miners and other users will likely continue to diverge. Users cannot ignore the desires of miners because a blockchain based on proof-of-work that cannot incentivize enough mining cannot remain secure."
Just a different perspective I guess.

The height of the triangle equals the target move up or down depending upon which way the pattern breaks. 
A triangle can be ascending or symmetrical or descending etc and they can also be continuation or reversal setups.. but what defines a triangle is larger price spreads followed by tightening spreads that get to a nexus or decision point. Usually trading volume falls away as this happens.
Then they break out or break down generally to target (height of pattern) on larger volume.
Hints on what is most likely to occur can be identified on shorter timeframe charts (trend line break then a retest of that break for confirmation.. then failure for example) before the triangle breaks down significantly on say the Weekly chart.
Google symmetrical triangle (as an example) and have a read.

No I wasn’t in crypto before the ATH. I watched it all happen but didn’t FOMO.. and then I watched it all the way down into the $3k’s area. It took forever. I wanted in badly but I waited. 
When it started the recovery leg up then I started accumulating small amounts. I didn’t expect it to run again to $14k so quickly. 
I’ve been buying heaviest into this current price range though. Loaded pretty hard into $6,800-$7,000 area.
I’d like to get to 3BTC if I can but not sure if I’ll get there. Depends on what happens next. I have the $ to get one more.. but.. of course I want it cheaper lmao which means it’ll probably Moon instead..
@_date: 2019-02-27 18:14:18
Setting up an ascending Triangle on the weekly which isn't too shabby. Don't know if the bottom is in but it's setting up as if it wants to test that break down point around $6k so.. watching for a break higher next 4-6 weeks. 
@_date: 2019-12-07 14:59:48
There’s a fuck tonne of clustered support around this area drawing a support line off 2013 Highs through the Monthly. The entire Crypto space is depending on Bitcoin. All major Crypto’s have already been decimated. With the halving not far away on top of all of this.. I think we are super close to bottoming out here around this current price level. Bitcoin won’t let us down!
@_date: 2019-12-03 07:32:07
I just clocked over into ownership of 2 BTC. Been buying after waiting what felt like ages for the market to base after hitting ATH’s. Was such a loooong wait.
Still buying! HODL!

21 week EMA @ ~$7,100 area. The 21 week EMA provided rock solid support for 5 months before the final capitulation in 2018. I’m expecting a Bull fight here.

lol go look at the 100 year historical Dow chart. Meh. ~21,500 next Rollover Support if shit hits the fan. 
In summary.. Bargains to be had.
Bitcoin will need to head lower yet. I have sliding Chart support at just under $4k next before a stop and rally. 
Bitcoin just broke a key level of support and is rejecting a Retest of that break. Just be patient with your buying. Good luck. BUY weakness. SELL strength. Because ultimately nobody knows where the bottom or top will ever ultimately be.
@_date: 2018-03-03 20:38:53
Follow the trend. Don't buy anything heading south just because you think it "looks cheap". Only buy stuff going up! Never buy anything going down! Best advice I can give to a new trader. Also don't let the opinions of others sway you from your plan/price action. Most people don't make money in any market. Don't be one of them. If price turns against you. Sell.
@_date: 2018-11-21 22:08:45
Probably need to extend the accumulation period. But it's a cool chart.
@_date: 2018-11-21 20:35:08
Bitcoin miners and the cost of mining Bitcoin has no direct correlation to price action. If it did it wouldn't have just tanked. The average price globally to mine it has already been breached by the current trading price. IMO of course.
@_date: 2018-11-21 20:40:22
That's ok. There are key levels of support and resistance that you can frequently gauge from looking at historical data. It is a fact that in many supposedly "chaotic" data sets that patterns appear. So the unpredictable isn't always so. It's about playing the probabilities to your advantage that's all.

One of my good trading mates put an update together on the previously posted roadmap.. still prepared to 
My chart is a little nicer and has support around low $6k USD on extended timeframe.

Need to pull back on the chart timeframe now as it's broken every Resistance level on the existing one..
How's that  working out for you now? Messy. 
I hope people didn't mortgage their houses or use credit to buy up big above..
Will post a chart later in case anybody wants to see it.

I'm on twitter.. Here's a chart. Bitcoin keeps putting in weak rally's then making new lows. Watch hits and possible rebounds within channels drawn on chart. GL my target is around $6,200 at this stage.. but I'm very aggressive with my entries on anything going backwards this fast.. there's no way I'd be buying it today. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 22:42:51
Trader here. See attached chart. My buy would be base of the lowest charted channel somewhere in the lowish $6k range. Bitcoin is in a sharp short term down trend. It is showing no current signs of breaking that trend. Yet. It throws down rejection tails then follows with poor rallies followed by new lows. Notice how price moves at the lines. Good luck. 
@_date: 2018-03-02 04:27:45
If it breaks and back tests $12k my call would be expect a retest of all time highs on Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-13 00:52:44

Yes you are. You are down the difference between your average buy price and bitcoins current value.
