Honestly I feel like for the first time I understand what this stuff is. Someone should consider linking this particular video into the newcomers welcome post.

overall.

ah. it *is* extremely unlikely someone would borrow more dollars than the total sum of dollars in circulation so there's a definite upper limit there... but I suppose you could hypothetically have some strange bidding war over a "last bitcoin"  where it goes for some obscene amount for no other reason than two dumb rich guys didn't want to lose... and wanted *that* bitcoin... But that would be crazy.

honestly, the Winkelvoss don't help the legitimacy argument at all.

So... when do I buy?

I'm thinking you were saying : nobody would ever value a bitcoin more than this because that's crazy enough people would stop. I'm wondering : people be crazy why start getting sane just cuz you hit some value? 
@_date: 2013-11-29 04:36:27
but, this is assuming a bitcoin's value is logical right? why should it be? why couldn't speculation drive it beyond rationality so the value of all bitcoins exceeded the total value of all currency in all nations before the world wakes up and corrects itself? 
Edit: I'm asking the opposite question you answered, why *that* upper limit? Why *not* a crazy *gazillion* wonka dollars then a crash?

I suppose I should read that thing about the dutch tulips again.

I'm new here. Heard about bitcoin when it hit 1k. I found this video much more intelligible than the typical garbage out there that assumes that I must be an idiot. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 04:07:58
wait... why should gold and bitcoin values be at all correlated? 
@_date: 2013-11-29 04:58:26
Okay, so you picked gold arbitrarily and speculated on the limit of speculation. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 04:44:32
well, that's definitely and answer to why people ascribed *value* to both... but I am really wondering why the upper limit of this bidding insanity would have a hard upper bound at all and why that upper bound is based on the upper bound of gold's value.
