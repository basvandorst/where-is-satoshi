Congrats cloudbet. Instead of paying me the 3 BTC you owe me, I will not spend 3 BTC to make sure this gets known.

I have been trying to deal with them through their support. It only has ended in horrid pain for me.
So basically here is what happened: I withdrew BTC to the wrong address. I did what I thought was best and contacted cloudbet support as fast as I could. They told me that my issue would be sorted out shortly. This is when the user "Cloudbet Support" was replying to me. Since they told me it would get taken care of, I did not think to take any other measures to ensure that my BTC would be sent to the correct address. I should not have trusted the support and taken extra measures to ensure it would get taken care of. The support told me that all transactions that were of high amounts (in my case it was 3.0 BTC) are manually reviewed by the team before being sent out. About 18 hours later I check and they sent out the bitcoins. So not only did the support lie to me, I just lost 3 BTC.
Now here is the catch. Another support person contacted me trying to explain that I sent the coins to the wrong address. I got that. I don't need to be told what I already know. The support person then started to lie to me. You can see what they said in the last screenshot. This person refused to refund because of their support lying.
I look forward to seeing your reply on this now public issue. I really don't want to handle this privately anymore. I am not going to take the chance of being lied to even more.
Proof of them saying it would get sorted out shortly
Proof of them saying that each transaction is reviewed
Now here is the best part. This is the support telling me the above two things were never said (different person)
Proof is in order:

I have an entire email thread of them lying to me, I made another reddit post on that specific matter.

No problem. I hope this does not happen to you

Nothing more you can do?
You can take care of it like you said you would in the first place. Of course there is something that you can do. That is just more lies. I am sure every single person here can agree the same. This is why I wanted to have this in a public area.
