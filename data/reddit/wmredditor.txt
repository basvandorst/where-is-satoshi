Likely not

What do they do?

Brilliant perspective.
That would be the only barrier to entry, although exchanges can solve it.

Lol I really do. Thanks for the correction on "taught."

Just a random Reddit guy who believes it's important to let newbies know that short term investments into Bitcoin could hurt like it did in 2018.
If a person isn't in for the long-term, they may be better off looking elsewhere.

They'd rather not talk about that.

I think there's one already. Lite.im or something

Without a doubt. Bitcoin Pizza day already says it all!

He evades taxes in a legal way. I think its better to learn how to play the system

Same reason I don't listen to those who say not your keys, not your crypto.
Can you think of the number of people that would be using Bitcoin today if not for those centralized exchanges?
Maybe a few hundred thousand people.

Until you have a blackout (lol)

Bitcoin doesn't have an office that can collapse
@_date: 2019-12-10 17:15:00
Haven't heard this before.
@_date: 2019-12-24 15:28:50
Okay. That's cool. Thanks for sharing
@_date: 2019-12-30 12:56:17
Brilliant line of thought here.
Anyone else buying into this?
@_date: 2019-12-23 17:18:30
Who knows the background of this story?
I'm just wondering why I should be excited about it/
