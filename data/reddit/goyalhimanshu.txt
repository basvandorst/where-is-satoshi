A few banks took this decision on their own as a precaution fearing government scrutiny. The government only wants people to pay taxes and they seem to be heading in the direction of regulation right now. Don’t fall for any such Indian FUD,

Ain’t easy reading the crystal ball bro
@_date: 2018-01-17 10:08:50
I bought at 19.5, 17, 15, 13. Only regret is that I can’t buy more at an even lower price now

Just enjoying people getting spooked these days ��
@_date: 2018-01-30 14:39:22
The whales gotta buy as low as possible I believe, just stay and let February turn out. That’s my plan, to each their own. 
@_date: 2018-01-24 01:24:28
I hate that 13K resistance. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 16:06:49
Lol nothing happened as expected 
@_date: 2018-01-26 09:52:19
Exactly. The stupid FUD is strong 
@_date: 2018-01-23 15:06:03
Come on South Korean whales, jump back on the ship already. Missing ya’ll

To stop this fucking speculation eventually and transact in btc in the near future. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 14:23:28
Maybe I meant that it’s gonna bounce back to 9K level ? 
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:10:07
Unbelievable I’m still in, lol. Remember this after a few weeks too okay bro ? 
@_date: 2018-01-16 10:02:53
Seriously going down WITH this ship. Shake off the fucking loose hands. There is a bigger purpose!!!
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:09:14
Buy the dip and you will remember it as a very happy day 
@_date: 2018-01-26 11:39:22
Self made little bitch lol
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:24:23
Bullshit. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 12:13:06
Just a precautionary measure by the banks (on their own) fearing money laundering scare from bitcoin exchanges. No official negative action by the government. Till now, they only want people to pay taxes and regulate the working. 
@_date: 2018-01-26 21:52:53
It’s not a bitcoin hack. Bitcoin can not be hacked. Coins of some crypto currency were stolen from an exchange. Don’t spread FUD
@_date: 2018-01-22 14:25:23
Ya, I just try to buy more if I can if it goes down. Irresistible prices these days 
@_date: 2018-01-21 18:23:20
Shut the fuck up. Bullshit FUD. They want to regulate it and tax people efficiently. No ban talks at all for now 
@_date: 2018-01-22 23:18:04
@_date: 2018-01-13 01:53:10
Same boat. Also, I bought these dips 
@_date: 2018-01-17 02:11:41
very tasty dip of course 
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:51:28
Lol. Every coin is gonna be having such problems. Btc would have solved it and moved way beyond. Let the ‘dump’ be finished then we’ll see 
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:55:55
Let the issue sort itself out. Will take some time but it’s gonna be okay
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:58:20
Use Gemini bro. Fuck coinbase 
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:19:19
In the long run, it’s all good. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:05:52
Yes. Unless you don’t consider a $1000 anything ... 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:39:07
Keep walking that doge
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:38:37
Buy on ZebPay bro. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:49:03
The ‘self made’ little bitch is behind this fraud.

MOOOOOON BOIS
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:25:11
Buy high, sell low!
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:20:34
Yea bro fees is high rn. The thing you need to understand is that when we have issues, then do we try to resolve them. The lightning network is in working and when it comes online then btc will be viable in transactions. We just need to keep our trust in it and hodl on 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:02:37
No one knows man. Me personally do not think it’s gonna dip any lower. Strong support around 17.5K and people don’t seem to be willing to sell below 18. Gonna take a few to go back up and beyond 
@_date: 2017-12-05 07:40:25
Lol. Normal fluctuation. Anyway there are too many sell orders. It’ll keep going up and down for a while 
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:09:45
The government doesn’t want any publicity for Bitcoin. So, it has been declared neither legal, nor ‘illegal’. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:51:49
Revolution is always met with wars. Bitcoin is a great idea, it has great potential to win the world but it is an idea. An idea can either win or lose. Simple as that. Let’s hope it will emerge victorious among all the difficulties
Note : I’m all in in bitcoin. Belief in BTC and Andreas. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 13:00:14
Yes. I find Zebpay and Unocoin comfortable. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:15:22
Might be. Can’t wait for bounce back tho
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:45:09
Just put in some money and forget about it. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:04:03
That was not a pump. What was happening around 19K was definitely a manipulation. 
Even after all that and weak hands getting shaken off and all the FUD articles, btc holds strong. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:59:49
Use ShapeShift to convert to lite coin and transact in that. Keep your support with btc.

Bloodier by the hour rn. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:58:35
Look at GDAX closely. The whales are here 
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:39:58
Bitcoin is truly decentralised. Once these attacks fail one after another, the price will have smooth trends. As Andreas said, other coins need to have scaling problems to even try to manage them. Bitcoin will have be attracting everyone when they see the issues fade and the value rise 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:49:35
Educate your son man!
@_date: 2017-12-03 12:19:41
The potential of BTC really is mind blowing

Which country are you in 
@_date: 2018-02-01 13:53:10
It has always been ‘not a legal tender’. NOTHING CHANGED 
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:23:07
Yes to the couple of weeks. Maybe years now lol. Doesn’t matter to me anymore. I’m in it for the long haul. Up or down with the ship ��

₹1.8 billion rupees * it’s around $28 million USD
@_date: 2018-02-13 14:34:16
Only if people would stop feeding the damn whales already, been 4 fucking days and they still eating. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 13:52:40
FUD FUD FUD. Nothing changed. Still not legal and still not illegal.
@_date: 2018-02-11 12:11:19
All I’ve been seeing for the last few days is that people are buying whatever is being sold around this price ( a little bear happens to scare and then all the coins are bought again and again and again ) which makes me count it as a positive sign of a bull run soon. But, the market does what it wants and obviously no one knows shit 
@_date: 2018-02-14 14:57:54
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:06:58
NO BAN MAN NO BAN. Stop spreading FUD. Same status as always. Not legal NEITHER ILLEGAL. They will regulate its working only. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 12:06:58
Looks like a bull trap on bitfinex right now. Hope I’m wrong, can’t wait for the vegeta memes again 
@_date: 2018-02-14 12:32:02
Help valentines r/bitcoin, where them vegeta memes bros

@_date: 2018-02-06 04:09:05
They should probably be backed by $$ according to me because the news came around in December actually. Till now nothing has happened and they’ve printed more and more even after subpoenas. I don’t think they would be printing more after that if they didn’t have backing. 
Anything can happen tho, Time will tell
@_date: 2018-02-09 05:58:36
Turns out I did call it for what it was I guess 
@_date: 2018-02-21 09:19:17
Feels like the dips we had during the November-December ‘17 bull runs are back. Segwit support ok bitfinex and coinbase is a very big deal, people can do cheap transactions now so many people are going to jump back in. I believe this week will be a fucking rally
@_date: 2018-02-01 13:53:56
No ban. They literally set 10% tax. Just regulation 
@_date: 2018-02-01 09:46:04
It really was the most stupid thing I have ever seen. Lol
@_date: 2018-02-11 12:06:35
Or whales are just scooping up tonnes of coins around this price 
@_date: 2018-02-12 09:18:27
That’s what I’ve been saying for the past 3 days dude, whales buying up whatever is being sold around this price. They trying to stock up before the rally back to 5 digits 
@_date: 2018-02-09 05:58:20
You must be new brother. See what happened ? 
@_date: 2018-02-09 11:08:33
Boring day today 
@_date: 2018-02-02 00:21:48
Second this 
@_date: 2018-02-09 07:58:17
Yes thousands of btc were dumped yesterday, I’m actually so happy that it’s still so stable around 8 right now. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 12:33:28
Just a hunch 
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:12:29
Seconded 
@_date: 2018-02-11 10:25:41
Looked like a bear trap to me. I think we will see 9K again today 
@_date: 2018-02-15 20:00:03
Oh damn my bad, was too high when I was reading the article man..
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:05:32
Nothing got killed by him. Everyone is misinterpreting his remark and spreading FUD. Nothing changed at all. Bitcoin’s status same as always in the eyes of govt.
@_date: 2018-02-17 08:33:47
