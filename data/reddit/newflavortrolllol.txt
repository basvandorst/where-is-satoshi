If Satoshi lives forever, can he broadcasts signed spends into the past?

Funny how all the higher-voted replies complain about fees rising and greedy miners. Then halfway down, useful posts aimed at people actually using Bitcoin.

MultiBit have their own hacked up microtransactions where they tally up the amount you owe them, and periodically add a macrotransaction to themselves. It's an open source wallet so you could just edit this out, but you wouldn't download a TV, would you?

Thank you for bringing me back here, to hear Senator Ted's prognostication all over again. It's almost like the guy is Satoshi himself.

"sidechain" is a specific technical term. you are describing centralized ledgers, which are perfectly fine for your use.

I'm sorry, but the new flavor of troll is members of this sub who used to make meaningful contributions, and have morphed through the power of horde solidarity into blocksize noise spam. I like your "unique hobby", but let's have more pictures and fewer words for a few months, ok?

sent twice to the same address (a new one was generated after the first transaction).
glad to see my second deposit credited properly.
good luck with the new business.

Sounds like the implied "the sky is not falling" is quite a substantial ignorral of a certain camp's "the sky is falling" position.

A lot of new bitcoiners are using software (or exchanges) unaware of the fee market, instead using hardcoded fee values. An attack like this punishes the users and developers/staff of these services until they upgrade.

It's not a DDoS, because the network still works; it's just become more expensive to use, as a defense against the attack. The cost of using the network adapts to the value expended in the attack.
Is it fun? Perhaps for the attacker, or for miners that have an efficient [knapsack]( heuristic.
Is service being denied? No^^^t ^^^entirely.

I used it for transactions before, but never saved coins until recently.

Bitcoin is not a big truck. Bitcoin is not something you just dump something on.

Hearn's piece presents arguments. Strong is a strong word.
The stress tests do not present an argument one way or the other, they just cost spammers money and thus boost the price.
