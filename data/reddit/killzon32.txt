In a perfect world I would want no government and no taxes and no corporations,   but sadly I live in a world where being pragmatic is the only way to achieve anything meaningful.

I have not read it and neither has Johnson which is why he said hes for free trade and if TPP does that then he would support it, if not he wouldn't.   Very simple to understand.
@_date: 2016-08-17 01:04:18
You are coming to the assumption that the TPP is only bad.
Jeffrey Tucker, an anarcho-capitalist economist who is a pretty large bitcoin advocate.  Supports Gary Johnson.
He also doesn't like the TPP but its not as bad as everyone makes it out to be.
The Cato institute talks about how there is more good then bad in the TPP.
TPP is a wedge issue, nothing more.
Perfect world like Johnson says there wouldn't be a TPP because free trade is free trade.
@_date: 2016-08-17 02:37:26
I never argued that TPP is 100% good,  I said Gary Johnson was supporting it because it was more good then bad. 
You should read what I said.

@_date: 2016-08-17 01:37:22
Yeah, says the Bernie supporter.  I believe the only reason why you dislike the TPP is because of Bernie a democratic socialist hates free trade.
Edit:  Bernie lost and I am glad he lost.
@_date: 2016-08-17 01:30:15
Ah I see, because of the unknown parts of the TPP anything other then being against it is irrational and not objective because saying the TPP is good from the parts we do know of is irrelevant because of the unknown.
Cool.   
But hey, you obviously know more then the cato institute and read everything about it from your biased sources.
Thanks for opening up my mind to your profound logic and insight,  Gary Johnson is the devil thanks for opening my eyes.   I guess I should go to the_donald and circle jerk about building the wall to keep mexicans out.

International trade and investment go hand-in-hand, as most trade is
conducted between affiliates of the same multinational enterprises –
often parent companies exporting components or finished products to
affiliates abroad, who then process or package and sell to end users in
foreign countries. Although the trade liberalizing features in other
chapters of the agreement will also serve to encourage more FDI in the
region, the TPP Investment chapter establishes certain rules governing
the treatment of foreign investors and foreign investment that should
amplify investment flows.
Among the more prominent features is that a “negative list” approach to
investment liberalization was adopted, meaning that the parties listed the
sectors of their economies excluded from the investment commitments
agreed in the chapter. The negative list approach is considered more
liberalizing because any industries not listed are open to new investment
– including industries that don’t yet exist but are likely to emerge in the
future. Moreover, the existence of a list of sectors that remain protected
readily identifies industries that might be targeted for future reforms.
Another important feature of this chapter is that the parties agree to not
use so-called performance requirements, such as minimum export-tooutput
ratios, use of local content, or the transfer of technology to
domestic entities,as conditions of investment.
Like investment chapters in other U.S. FTAs, this one includes provisions
for the controversial investor-state dispute settlement (ISDS)
mechanism, as well as a carve-out that precludes tobacco companies
from bringing ISDS claims. The investor state dispute settlement
mechanism is more about litigation than liberalization. And the
discrimination against tobacco through the "tobacco carve out" sets a
bad precedent that could open the door to discrimination against other
products and industries in the future.

 A state of disorder due to absence or nonrecognition of authority
 Absence of government and absolute freedom of the individual, regarded as a political ideal.

Good quote I like is 
"the true nature of a man is decided in the battle between his conscious mind and the desires of the subconscious. Evil in the subconscious is too strong to resist and the only way to win is to deny it battle"
Government is the problem not the solution.
Capitalism is nothing more then a tool run by men and men are corruptible and without competition corruption lingers and government allows the legality of force against competitors.
The reason why this doesn't work with government is because government is a monopoly on itself and men are corruptible.
So its pretty easy to understand this problem the only way to win is to deny battle.

 "Moderated inflation is incredibly useful."
For the past 100 years? Inflation is a tool of the federal reserve, it's not this horrible doomsday device that it is so often portrayed as in circles like the Gold and Bitcoin club of fanatics.
**Wrong.**  It is a doomsday device as in it will eventually implode rather then having booms and busts cycles we prop up horrible systems until eventually it implodes.

Government is primitive and I only expect it to become irrelevant in the future either by self destruction and hurting a lot in the process or a slow steady pace to reducing itself into being non existent, however I doubt government would loosen its grip on power it always leads to it turning on its own people.
I might be wrong but I think America will be one of the few first world nations with a slow reduction in government.. Thanks to so many guns we have.

I would agree, but in this situation hes talking about politics and since I don't know his opinions on the topic I can't say what they are.
I don't see the point in your other comments, I am not disagreeing with his political philosophy I am just saying if you have personal bias against something and you give an opinion about it that it should be held with a grain of salt,  Even if hes correct.

Minarchists argue that the state has no authority to use its monopoly of force to interfere with free transactions between people, and see the state's sole responsibility as ensuring that contracts between private individuals and property are protected, through a system of law courts and enforcement. Minarchists generally believe a laissez-faire approach to the economy will most likely lead to economic prosperity.

I am biased when it comes to being anti-government ~anarchist.  But the whole notion of more government is disturbing,   Sure Bernie is not Stalin but who say's Bernie wont set in motion a new Stalin?  Expanding government only increases its power, power should be from the citizens not the government.      Sure a mad man can kill 100 people but a mad president with overarching power can kill millions.
History tends to repeat itself,  Hopefully due to the nature of society something even more horrible does not happen in the future.

As a Libertarian, bitcoin to me goes far beyond profit this is a fundamentally disruptive program that will greatly change the world for the better.
Right now it looks like 200-250$ is the norm and if bitcoin keeps growing and becomes easier to use eventually a giant speculation bubble will arise and when that happens it will be a fun time on this reddit.

They always act like buying drugs is bad "shame on them" type attitude, I would like to see a Libertarian just blast everyone about using that stupid scare tactic.

I would wish someone would say something along these lines. Banning things we don't like does not solve the problem let alone If I wanted to get drugs it would be easier for me to just find a dealer and I have no idea whats in the drugs and if the dealer uses violence when faced with competition.
Silkroad is doing an amazing job allowing those to get what they wanted safely and those making the drugs to be competitive without being violent.

Tax is coercive and having an authority to take others money will end up having fraud and abuse and will only end up wasting money that could be used for good.
Libertarians/anarchists/ and many other groups believe that we can have maximum prosperity if we leave society to handle issues of society rather then having government leach and make slaves out of us in order to do what we can already do.
Though I like limited government and not none.

Well I would say Libertarianism is doing fine, UKIP is a Libertarian branded party in the UK and its doing amazingly well.   In america it's a lot harder to push Libertarianism when we have a duopoly but as you see republicans know they can't win without the Rand Paul's of the republican party and with a large Libertarian base in the republican party co-opting it we can push for Libertarian candidates..
Though I agree that the Libertarian party is not needed so much In America since we got a duopoly but don't hate on the accomplishment's since most likely it was the Libertarian party who made a geek change ideology's who then ended up creating a currency that was decentralization and digital.
