Utterly useless, unless the intent is to carry it around in your wallet and impress family &amp; friends with a fancy plastic card with holograms etc. Then again, carrying it around probably defeats its purpose.
Also, by using such a card you are relying on the manufacturers claim that the cards were produced in such a way that private keys were not exposed at any time during production.
Pointless product, with a high cost, that is way less secure than if you printed your own keys for safe keeping.

Low liquidity is alwasy an issue when there are few market participants. Expect margins to decrease as it gets more popular. If that happens of course.
Of course you are welcome to place your own offer if you dont like the listed price.

There is a dispute and arbitration process. BTC are locked in case of non-release and arbitrator checks on blockchain if funds were transferred and then acts in favour of BTC buyer.

Not sure about the question, but basics are: BTC buyer locks nothing. He sends fiat or altcoin. BTC seller locks his BTC in a multi-sig wallet, with the arbitrator as 3rd signer. Any 2 (buyer+seller, buyer+arb or seller+arb) can release the locked BTC. If there is a dispute, the arbitrator steps in and makes a decision about who is right. If the fiat recipient does not confirm, the BTC buyer will have to provide some proof of fiat payment. So, a requirement for a  fiat payment to be listed is that there is some way to prove payments. This is no guarantee to avoid scam, however. Bitsquare is not so different from Localbitcoins, except that it is decentralized.

You just summed up every btc/cash trade I have been involved in. The other party will jump even seeing the shadow of a bird. Deep inside us, we all feel intensely watched and handling any amount of cash above "normal" just "feels" criminal. What a world it has become.

That last part part: "BU have already announced that they have a war chest of hundreds of millions of $ and when the hard fork comes they will spend that money trying to kill the core chain"
Should we take this threat seriously? I mean, what is the economic incentive for them to maintain their patent advantage (asic boost) when considering possibly a huge expense trying killing the other chain? If they succeeded, how many years of their patent advantage will they have burned off, and what does the future then hold? BitmainCoin will be the established "bitcoin" and it will be apparent for whole world that the original vision of Satoshi for a decentralized currency is dead. In the end, it will not have been a goverment that brought down bitcoin through regulation or other attack, but rather a relatively minor organization whose only claim to power is a patent based on a (correctable) software bug.
What a sad ending that would be.

Times are changing fast, and even European countries now have some means to seize your money if you cannot explain where you got them. Proof of criminal activity is not required.

So if I have any bitcoin, on any device anywhere in the world, then (if the bill passes) do I need to declare this to customs when entering the US?
