I hardly think so. Most people couldn't even buy lunch with Bitcoin even if they wanted to.

No technical details, just some desperate plunge protection hopium.

Gee, wishful thinking, much?
Paypal hiring someone who has previously worked on Bitcoin related stuff means absolutely fuck all in terms of them doing anything with Bitcoin themselves.

These people are dumb. How exactly will it save money? Transactions processing cost fuck all, the whole world of HFT is based on that very fact.

And of course Gavin has provided a detailed rebuttal of Hearn's concerns in his 4 word Twitter retort.

Interesting. Things aren't looking so good right now.

$50,000 across 7500 cards. Take that VISA!

I don't because there isn't anything Hearn said that isn't true

Specious comparison.
1. ATM skimmers are no more a fault with mainstream currencies than exchange hacks are a fault intrinsic to Bitcoin
2. Victims of compromised ATMs get reimbursed. Victims of Bitcoin exchange hacks do not.

I can only speak for how it works within the EU, but here it's part of consumer protection legislation.

Oh please, you're asking for information which you must know damn well that nobody is going to be able to provide, presumably so when said information is not forthcoming you can say 'nothing to see here, Tether must be legit'.
Tether is an obvious scam, and plenty of you known that perfectly well, but it is a scam which just like the Gox shenanigans has driven the Bitcoin price to ridiculous levels backed by the assumption that there is an influx of investment into Bitcoin behind all those Tether's. There isn't of course.
Tether exists for no other reason than to manipulate the price of Bitcoin by creating the belief that fiat currency is flooding into Bitcoin. This mission has been aided by bankrupt exchanges working had in glove with Tether.

Being popular with neckbeards and yet being only scantly used as a medium of exchange are not mutually exclusive properties.

With everyone HODLing, where are the customers going to come from? 
The only significant success Bitcoin has had in facilitating retail has been in the trade of illicit items, and since TSR went titsup, and given how it happened, even people buying dope will probably decide finding a local dealer is better than risk being suckered by an FBI honey pot.

Umm, 99.99%+ of the world does not have Bitcoin to spend. Of the tiny minority who do own some, most are HODLers.
