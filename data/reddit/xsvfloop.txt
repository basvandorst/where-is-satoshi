Their terms" no association *trading/sending* coins to and from Coinbase to any time of gambling site. Your account will be closed by them more than likely and your money should either get send back to your poker site or Coinbase has it. Sorry lad  
@_date: 2017-05-26 17:42:21
I'm not, it got down to  $2243

You need to start your verification process aka giving your identity away, but most reputable exchanges require a lot of information for higher limits. 
@_date: 2017-05-05 17:02:21
I agree that having to give your SSN for buying BTC is a joke, but even Coinbase with eventually ask for it when you cash out large/buy large for their verification process. Don't know of any other options other than paying insane price markups at ATMs or giving to much information. 
@_date: 2017-05-06 16:28:48
Wow I'm jelly, wish Coinbase would verify me.. How may months will it take. Stay tuned.
@_date: 2017-05-24 17:03:30
Interesting play, please let us know how this goes after 3-4 months of hodl
@_date: 2017-05-06 16:29:47
Interesting how they make us go through multiply layers just to be able to buy what we want.

Gemini 
@_date: 2017-05-10 19:56:51
Yeah their customer service is trash but full blown scam is dramatic.
@_date: 2017-05-20 13:43:50
Moron, it legit clearly states that transferring Coins from Coinbase to gambling sites is cause for account closure. First off never keep your coins on Coinbase transfer to a wallet. If you insist on gambling you could have transferred the coins to the wallet then to the site to not violate terms by sending from Coinbase. ( they want a record of what you do with your coins)

Market stronger than ever, if you didn't buy in the dip you missed out.

@_date: 2017-05-26 17:39:40
Buy buy buy 
@_date: 2017-05-05 17:12:20
Coinbase currently allows your to buy LTC but not large amounts (no more than $300 worth per week) that's the problem they have such low limits and long verification waits times. In 30 days the market can change substantially and sometimes they can take longer than 30 days to process. I hope Gemini works out. 
@_date: 2017-07-01 17:43:32
If you are at all worried about the money you put in Bitcoin or every other crypto, Get out because this is not for you. Risk is good 
@_date: 2017-05-26 16:55:54
Yeah that sucks you honestly may not hear from them for months 
@_date: 2017-05-13 22:09:38
Was this "renew F2A" pop up on Coinbase or was it an email.. 
@_date: 2017-05-19 14:53:04
Buy it feels good just to have some BTC 
@_date: 2017-05-31 22:42:12
Isn't their a decision date?
@_date: 2017-06-10 18:34:16

How do you change your Trezor home screen

Hmm maybe export to them the public key they can use it on my most sites 
@_date: 2017-06-08 17:41:04

I'm lost are you trying to gamble your money or launder... very different meanings 
@_date: 2017-06-15 16:09:53
lol click bait troll that posted more accurate shit than most.
@_date: 2017-06-07 02:16:42
Agree 
@_date: 2017-06-02 03:22:10
Usally instant, I think you bought when they had 40k new accounts sign up in 1 day and backlogged a ton of purchases and account verifications. Sorry 
@_date: 2017-06-04 16:16:27
Troll? Price is going down...
@_date: 2017-06-08 17:36:16
I agree just like posting when it goes down to see what people's responses are good or bad 
@_date: 2017-06-03 18:57:27
We are still going down 
@_date: 2017-06-13 17:48:15
Make an app/web site allowing your friends to access their "portfolio" balance sheets etc. They can see how much they make while you do all the real work. Import the key there giving you/them less of a headache in the long end 
@_date: 2017-06-04 17:36:22
Aug 1st is the day of days for BTC so be wary of that
@_date: 2017-06-13 17:55:47
Yeah that's anal. 
@_date: 2017-06-03 18:02:36
Transfer money from Coinbase to Blockchain wallet that you make. Then send the money from the Blockchain wallet to the gambling site to ovoid any problems. Blockchain could care less where you send your BTC but Coinbase will. Have fun.
@_date: 2017-06-22 18:22:23
Agreed 
@_date: 2017-06-06 17:21:58
