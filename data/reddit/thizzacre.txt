Yes, Monero for example has a dynamic block size, limited by the median size of the last 100 blocks, and not by a hard coded upper limit.
The fear is that dynamic blocks might make the network vulnerable to spam attacks. A miner could bloat the size of the block with fake transactions, increasing the cost of mining and driving some of his competitors out of business, leading to further centralization. This isn't necessarily an intractable problem but the idea doesn't seem very popular in the Bitcoin community.

That was a joke dude.
I don't disagree that bitcoin may very well be displaced by other cryptos. My point is merely that if bitcoin became an established part of our economy it would increase slowly in value even without further adoption. Bitcoin is not a pyramid scheme where the last people in must sell at a loss. In that scenario the future supply is very relevant even if people continue to use other cryptos and fiat.  Deflation/inflation is, I agree, not key to crypto's value, but the fact that the future supply is controlled by a fully predictable algorithm is a pretty important part of why many prefer a decentralized system like bitcoin to fiat, especially people from countries such as Venezuela who have experienced runaway inflation.

Not necessarily. In our utopian future when bitcoin replaces the dollar, the value of bitcoin will grow with the economy, as we become more productive. Of course in that case the growth would be a lot slower than this speculation-fueled explosion. The dollar would do this to a greater extent too if it wasn't inflationary.
