I need him to finish the big 5 series.  The first couple were great.

Thanks, yea I'm new to changetip so I sent a handful of context free tips this weekend to see how it works. I'll stop that practice.  1500 bits @_date: 2014-11-17 05:40:33
quick aside... has anyone had a tip take over 3 hours for the bot to confirm? 
@_date: 2014-01-03 07:31:30
that may be an expensive proposition...
i know he denies it, but I still think he may have held onto his priceline.com equity stake from before the bubble, he may be sitting on a billion now with the stock over $1100/share.

There's got to be a positive correlation between misleading articles and the use of physical bitcoin images.

I showed him this thread and he identified my post (and thanked me for not doxxing his name etc) so maybe he'll join.

less than a week ago he said he believed that Mt Gox would be recover and be around in a year when his podcast mates thought otherwise. He likely doesn't know the extent of the corruption. 
@_date: 2014-11-17 05:59:52
strange... 
tip in question: 
@_date: 2014-11-17 06:44:05
yea, must be something like that because the tip isn't reflecting in my changetip account either. here's 1500 bits so I can regain some confidence in the system.

Two days ago, during a mundane call i made to Ally, I ended up convincing a customer service rep to make his first BTC purchase. He's been updating me of his revelation experience via gchat.
@_date: 2014-11-17 06:58:36
last question.. does that user I sent the failed tip too see then that I sent him a tip that it didn't go through? In which case I should tip via DM so it's not awkward. 2000 bits @_date: 2014-11-18 06:29:21

i love that no two Andreas speeches are the same.

Even though it's not showing up in my changetip account ledger as well?
@_date: 2014-11-17 07:11:35
ok cool, so since it was spam filtered the recipient didn't see the failed tip... no harm done. 
@_date: 2015-01-06 08:25:49
It's not like a socio-political conflict of interest. A few years ago when twitter was very young it would have been poor form for a guy like him *not* to do this type of thing for a fledgling portfolio company.
Edit: clarity
@_date: 2014-03-03 20:18:43
yes, it is but it's too entrenched now.

Are you guys hiring in Venice/SaMo?
@_date: 2013-11-08 07:36:41
man that's really depressing...  
edit: maybe even more than losing 4 coins, which was money that I was prepared to lose in the first place. I cant imagine how the masses are going to be able to handle constant security risk. 
@_date: 2013-10-09 06:07:45
great idea. I will setup a Multibit account to practice with and I'll send back the tip once I figure out how. Thanks.
@_date: 2013-10-29 00:56:25
do you trade other crypto currencies? what do you use for those?

Some follow up questions for you, if you don't mind, or others. Apologies if these are overly novice.
1.What program or method is he using to generate that randomized wallet address?
2.if its not connected, how does he or the program know that address doesn't belong to someone else thus sending bitcoin to someone or that someone else will generate it later and start transacting with what he had sent?
3.If the address is completely offline, is there a way to know if the coins are attributed to it (can he verify that the bitcoins are able to come into existence at a later date)? Perhaps he screwed up a digit in the address unknowingly or something..
@_date: 2013-11-08 06:37:56
This. I dont think i fully understood it.
@_date: 2013-11-18 08:21:24
na, leave it in... who knows how much .4 BTC will be when he's 18.

You still pay with your primary funding source,  the credit card is just backup/identity check.

Primecoin, for the same reason as stated previously - using the mining power for something that might be productive elsewhere is highly compelling.
@_date: 2013-12-09 00:15:54
why has the pace of his video releases slowed lately?
@_date: 2013-11-08 06:30:25
Totally my fault. In the grand scheme of things I feel like I'm getting off somewhat cheap compared to other horror stories... i wont make those mistakes again.
@_date: 2013-11-08 07:16:09
so is it the case that every address in the blockchain is being tested at all times by bots? Meaning it took ~7 days to crack so to speak?
@_date: 2013-11-08 06:38:40
used a mac + chrome to generate the addresses
@_date: 2013-11-08 06:25:29
yep... i was just looking to get them off quick after I saw that poor guy lose 301 BTC from hot storage. I had then planned to do the whole offline generation when my new computer arrived. 
@_date: 2013-09-30 03:49:33
Can someone explain how to do what he describes at 25:30 - storing your bitcoin on paper?

When Bitcoin is ubiquitous the search for his identity will be the JFK case of the generation.

$550 is the current market value of 1 BTC on Bitstamp, which is a major bitcoin exchange and a good overall indicator.

no wasn't offline. brain wallet generated. I was planning to do a cryo-cold repackaging next month because I'm getting a new computer but I wanted to do something to get them out of hot wallets before then. No excuses, I should have taken the time to do it right from the start

It was a single obscure word, not in the dictionary. That's as far as I feel comfortable going tonight.
