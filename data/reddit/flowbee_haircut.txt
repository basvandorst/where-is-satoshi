Actually it should be taxfree, as it wasn't regulated back then. In Europe, after one year without touching it, it is free money imho. So have fun :). Give some to the poor and help where help is needed, don't get into a rich prig, that should be tax enough. Congrats. But nevertheless you should talk to a taxguy.

there is one rule: only buy if you could also throw the money out the window without getting panic. It means, only invest as much money as you would be willing to lose. Be careful, it's a rollercoaster ;). But have fun. Bitcoin is amazing. buy small charges - so you spread the risk a bit.

This copy and paste journalism sucks! They just copied it from coindesk and that's what they seem to do quite often - stealing from other pages. Also the translation sucks btw. And there was also another page with 8steps manual in german already also copied. They should create their own topics for instance germany related bitcoin things.

How should end-to-end encryption banning work? If you want to encrypt something nobody can stop you from doing so. The 'elder' politicians have no clue about how things work. There'll be no banning. They could try to forbid it for mainstream apps like whatsapp or fb, another reason to make people using better messengers. If more people realise that encrypting your conversations is something very natural, the better. And BTW: if terrorists want to use encryption, would they care about if it's not allowed by law?

Of course not.
