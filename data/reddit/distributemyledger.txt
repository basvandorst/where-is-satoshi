Why is everyone angry? Bank-like services taking custody on behalf of customers are dangerous. 
They regularly lose everything and leave their customers holding the bag.
This policy forces companies to cover that risk by keeping dollar reserves. It also means that services which do not take custody of Bitcoin will work there without problem.
Coinbase likes the fact that Bitcoin companies must be registered as money transmitters, but doesn't like the fact that reserves must be kept when companies act like Bitcoin banks?
That seems like a pretty self-serving opinion to me.

Aren't you supposed to be an impartial moderator who removes spam and scam posts, and stays out of personal attacks on people in the community?
If you are going to call someone a liar, you better have evidence, and moreover, you should apply the same standards to everyone, not just those who you disagree with.
It's like Theymos recruited Anne Coulter and Bill O'Reiley to moderate a political debate.
I mean, you aren't even trying to pretend to be impartial anymore! It would be hilarious if it wasn't so tragic for the Bitcoin community.

And when they "lose" my 1BTC, because they do not and never have provided proof of reserves or me with control of my keys, there's $1,200 in a bank account to reimburse me.
Coinbase is OK with money transmitter regulation and KYC applying to Bitcoin exchange, but not OK with keeping enough cash on hand to compensate their customers when they are hacked or robbed by insiders?
I find the idealistic tone of that blog post to be unintentionally hilarious, given their eagerness to go way above and beyond the requirements of regulation and use it as a competitive barrier. But when a tiny State like HI wants to make sure their customers are protected, they pitch a fit.
If they had a way for customers to supply addresses or their own master public keys to produce addresses when buying Bitcoin, and the ability to send it into an address to sell it, I feel those deposits should be exempted from these rules.

That's nice, and totally unimportant. Here are the key questions:
Will I be able to "rootstock" Bitcoin to any merchant or company already accepting Bitcoin? Will it work with already hardened Bitcoin wallet software?  Or... will this require a complete rebuild of the existing payment integrations already working with Bitcoin today (a non-starter in my book)? 
What is the user experience like?
Can we send money with it now and see how it really works in production?
If it isn't a working system we can check out, then it's no better than a powerpoint presentation for addressing the transaction backlog. It's great smart people are trying things, but until someone delivers, they shouldn't be the focus of solving our immediate issues with the Bitcoin transaction backlog. You don't visit a "surgery planner" when you need emergency surgery, and you don't turn to white papers and experimental software when your enterprise software systems are failing. Let's stop mismanaging Bitcoin, please.

When there were competing clients by other development teams, we all agreed that node count was a meaningless statistic and miner hash power mattered, because these teams could simply spin up thousands of nodes on AWS for very little investment.
Now we are saying that the investment in mining hardware doesn't matter, and we should encourage nodes to run software that censors transactions from the network and forces miners to comply or risk orphaned blocks?
I think this sounds like a terrible idea for Bitcoin. I can't believe this is being presented here with a straight face in a positive light. Get the miner support or go start an alt coin.

There's a strong hatred on the other sub for this one, which means there is a LOT of noise and shitposting, but if you filter through it, I find that there are many more open ideas expressed on that one vs. this one.
This one has better quality, but the content is clearly curated, and some of what appears to be quality content is disguised advertising. Again, you have to be smart to know that, and pick through it as well to find things worth reading.
I have an issue with the deceptive nature of the moderation on this subreddit, mainly because of new people. It is definitely easier to read?

Yeah, so hint. I'm not new to Bitcoin... 
Please don't tell random people to hurry up and buy. 1) they need to know how to store it safely (i.e. on a paper / hardware wallet, not an exchange), 2) they don't understand holding vs. emotional buying/selling into rallies and drops.

You have a secret definition that is correct, but you can't tell us what it is, because if you did, the spammers would work around it.
How do we know your secret definition is correct or that we agree? Are you asking the community to "trust you"? 
What if a spammer told us they had a different secret definition? Why should we trust you more than we should trust the spammer?
What if two spammers said they have a definition, and one of them was President Trump, who is absolutely a spammer according to my secret definition.
Shouldn't we believe the President of the United States before we believe you?

I do not agree with you. I think this view leads to inaction and puts Bitcoin in more danger than addressing the capacity issues directly.


This statement is just completely made up. See the BIP50 flag day upgrade for a playbook on how to execute an interruption free hard fork on Bitcoin. We've done this before without issues.

I think you mean to say that a company must get a NY license if any of its customers are residents of NY State USA. It doesn't matter if the company is headquartered in NY State, another US State, or on the other side of the planet. If you have customers in NY State, you need a license. The bitlicense is a shining example of bad regulation that protects incumbents and hurts innovators. The NY DFS should be ashamed, and the fact that Lawsky left office to consult companies on how to comply with the regulation he just created is completely sleazy and unethical. These are the people who are writing our rules. Disgusting. Absolutely disgusting. He should be jailed.

Because we don't believe the group paying too many developers will follow through. They have done nothing to earn our trust. In fact, they have repeatedly lied and misled.

It's being proposed by a developer on the bitcoin dev mailing list.
The fact that UASF was approved for circulation on that list proves that core is considering it. 
I know, they blocked my attempts to share well thought through ideas and code for increasing the blocksize until I finally gave up.
If UASF went through, that means they are discussing it. That was in one of the articles. Did you read them?

I am so glad to see this here. I could not agree more, especially your characterization of "UASF" as a node-signaling attack vector. We've seen how easy it is to spin up thousands of nodes on AWS. "UASF" doesn't even have the security of proof of stake, which still falls way short of what we have with proof of work. My mind is also boggled...
@_date: 2017-03-03 04:23:22
Yes, we're idiots and will not understand that your sarcasm is not meant to invalidate the prior appeal to authority fallacy. /s
Look, it's not activating without a block size increase. At this point you are going to be lucky to see it activate at all given the level of mistrust. It's not just the other forum. It's all over the place, and it's well earned too.
If you missed it, BTC-U just merged a fix to transaction malleability that requires less change to the codebase and doesn't meddle with the transaction fee cost of signature vs. regular data in blocks. You guys need to get out of your echo chamber, as soon as possible!

Because miners on rare occasion mine on empty blocks because it is more profitable to do so. That's how mining works. Smearing Antpool is a political hit job and that empty block won't make a meaningful difference in the backlog. They could decide not to mine empty blocks, but their profitability would drop a bit under 1%. Mining is a competitive business, and unless they are being subsidized by some group (cough cough) to not mine empty blocks, all miners will do it.
I want to know why we can't increase the blocksize, when we've executed planned hard forks before (see BIP50 and the flag day announcement in May '13).
@_date: 2017-03-04 08:50:43
"contentious hard forks"
Meaningless drivel.
We planned for one in May 2013, and executed it on August 16 2013. A hard fork that is. In Bitcoin. Don't hear about that too much over here in N Core-ea lately. Almost like it has been erased from history somehow?
A 2MB blocksize increase would not be contentious to the vast majority of users, businesses and miners. We've been screaming for that since 2014.
Yet here you are, blockchaining it up with your meaningless "contentious hard fork" weasel words. 
I miss the days of Bitcoin before people like you co-opted it and ruined the creativity with your BS.
@_date: 2017-09-30 02:33:31
I could write PayPal wars.
You are grossly oversimplifying how regulation works. There are four keys: 1) no component of any part of the peer to peer network should be centralized within a corporation that is beholden to a single country's authority. 2)  geographic distribution so that the peer to peer network runs redundantly across jurisdictions that do not agree or have aligned views on regulation,  3) the cost of running a component of that peer to peer network being within reach of non-enterprise entities (that doesn't mean a raspberry PI, it means within reach of an affluent person or a group of enthusiasts who pool their money in a first world country), and 4) the energy and internet bandwidth of running a component of the peer to peer network being subtle enough that it cannot be easily be tracked down by analyzing power usage vs. internet traffic analysis.
Right now, by far the biggest threat to the Bitcoin network is 1: blockstream due to c-word and clear attempts to centralize development / block scale.
You are talking about something completely different that is tangential to increasing the blocksize. Your post is entirely incorrect in terms of how regulation works, and even in the context of every government agreeing to regulate identically (LOLOL I can tell you don't know what you are talking about here), it still fails to make sense in terms of having deep nodes in a p2p network. 
TLDR: your post is a misleading non-sequitur.

Companies that exchange fiat for virtual currency (reg-speak for cryptocurrency) are regulated like money transmitters. Miners, wallet companies, or companies that exclusively let you trade one crypto for another are NOT regulated in the US and most other jurisdictions. Knowing this, the majority of companies you refer to are not, in fact, "subject to full government financial regulations". Coinbase, Xapo, and all the Bitcoin exchanges? Absolutely, highly regulated. Bitgo, blockchain, all the wallet companies, shapeshift? Not regulated. Miners? Not regulated. Your statement is inaccurate for the majority of the supporters and should be corrected.


It doesn't set a precedent, because the majority of the groups in support, and all of the miners in support, are not regulated as financial institutions at all.


Again, you need to fact check. This statement is based on a misunderstanding of the bank secrecy act, patriot act, and how FinCEN defines virtual currency exchangers, administrators, and users, as well as how the CFTC regulates commodities (only futures, not Bitcoin itself), and how the SEC regulates ICOs.


This is again wrong, because you made a glaring error in your initial statement that these companies are regulated. They are not.


And I'm just going to stop responding here. This post is factually incorrect and makes a number of points based on bad information. 
Readers should know that this post is effectively wrong, and I would disregard information from this author in the future without citations. I can't imagine writing something like this as an individual who actually understands VC regulation. The author is either incompetent or blatantly trying to mislead. Neither are good in my book.
This post is so bad it should be removed and the author reported.
