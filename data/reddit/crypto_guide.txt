That's great to hear from a lot of HODLers. Till when are you people going to HODL? Till the next halving event in 2020 or even after that?

Obviously the only choice of investment are not gold or bitcoin. But these 2 have been very good form of investment for lot of investors. There are lot of other asset classes and similar other options as well. You are free to go for them. Nobody is stopping you or anybody else.
