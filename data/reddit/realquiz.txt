Self-fulfilling prophecy...?

But that’s the goal of BTC (as I understand it). For the BTC market to eventually settle and the only fluctuations will be about as often as the USD fluctuates (which it does). So that way it does provide an improved solution to the USD. It’s very much not there yet, but its eventual goal is to be a currency and not a commodity.

The statement “BTC has no intrinsic value” could equally be applied to the dollar, or gold, or anything else of transactional value in our economy. These forms of currencies are just a systemic way to regulate and moderate our need for bartering: for the exchange of goods and services. I’m in advertising but I can’t trade my services for groceries. But I can trade it for money, which allows me to trade that money for groceries. Just replace “money” with anything really. And I think we all know the superior utility that crypto currencies have over the dollar or any other gold-backed currency.

Right. But you can’t use BTC for those things *now*. We’re betting that this superior solution can exists side by side with the USD through demand. 
In theory though, no currency has intrinsic value. But maybe “intrinsic” is the wrong word. Maybe “practical” might fit better. But either way, conceptually they are all valueless. Their value exists in their utility and is defined by their usefulness. In that sense you’re correct, the USD is more useful now.

I’ve saved this post to revisit annually. It’s a long term game - most of us aren’t here to get rich quick.
