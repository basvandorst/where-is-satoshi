One problem I've found is that when I set the currency to be in BTC instead of USD, only the price, market cap, and volume changes. The site doesn't show the percentage changes over the 1hour, 24hour, 1week, 30day time periods in BTC, only USD changes, even though I have the currency set as BTC.

Do you know of any exchanges that will let you do this with Korean Won?

I thought the gamblers fallacy was assuming past events influence present ones. It's come up black 15 times in a row, red MUST be next! Maybe there is more than one, but that's the one I always heard.

I've been studying forex recently and it seems like you're writing code for products that already exist. Have you taken a look at existing software that trades forex/cryptos in the exact manner you described?

Diversify investments is like rule one. Putting all your money in one investment is just too risky, ignoring the inherent risk of bitcoin.

Fair enough. I'm just not good enough of a coder to write my own.

They are not arbitrary until I can pay for my groceries and rent without needing to use them.

It's value IS tied to fiat though. Otherwise, we wouldn't be talking about a price drop.

Same % change, as well as the same return on investment. Log scales are super important!

Well, the statement 6 months ago is just as true now. There's no regulation. When regulation comes, so will more investor money, and firms will be jumping in too. Eventually. Hopefully.

The same can be said about forex, but it is still referred to as a zero sum game. Granted, crypto spreads are higher, but that is just due to current volitility, as we're seeing now.

Since when is Korean bitcoin 0 fee? Where do you find exchanges like that? 
@_date: 2017-09-14 16:30:23
Then you shouldn't be investing in bitcoin or anything else.

Really? Basically every broker I've found that let's you short stocks, forex, commodities etc will let you short cryptos too.

If you're trading them and not buying them......?

Most people don't because they are more familiar with memes than investments.

Because that green paper can put a roof over my head, food on my plate, and entertainment in my hands.
