If it’s just for your son to follow you could just start a portfolio on coinhodler. That way you just add what you want to be his...for example if u have 1 btc Nd u want to give him 0.5 just add 0.5 to coinhodler but it’s actually in ur wallet. Explained my point pretty shit but I hope u get what I mean.

Just updated mines last week, I’d say test your seed in the settings and go ahead with the update. If you’re still hesitant just transfer the btc to another wallet and then update. There was a part where my trezor became stuck on the enter seed part which made my heart beat twice as fast but turned my computer off and on and everything was fine.

Essentially the same thing, Coinbase is prettier and because of this has higher fees. Pro is harder to use for the first 5 mins but has significantly lower fees, tonnes of YouTube videos explaining how to use it.

Still deciding on the best way to convert BTC to GBP, what’s your preferred method?
@_date: 2018-04-21 19:29:31
I use a trezor, great for bitcoin pretty shit for other cryptos but safest option imo provided u buy it from trezor or a certified retailer

I need some recommendations on buying a whole bitcoin. I’ve been into crypto for over a year but never brought massive amounts. Price seems right to buy a bitcoin, any advice on how or where I should buy one?

Tbh if you are starting up and have small amounts coinbase might be useful (as much as I hate it because of the fees) just because of how easy it is to use but if you decide you want to invest more definitely go hardware wallet route. I personally started on coinbase Nd moved to binance as my main exchange (when I buy other coins... not a trader more so hodler) and trezor as my wallet as I learnt more about crypto.

Also it may be cheaper to not fuck with coinbase they’re really evil with fees could try gdax (run by coinbase but no fees for buying) or localbitcoins (much simpler then GDAX)
@_date: 2019-05-29 13:56:36
Someone posted it above

Trezor one - it’s a hardware wallet so highly recommend, has good and easy to use software.
