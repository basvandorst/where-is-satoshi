I remember it being more popular in the late 90s early 2000s. People on IRC would refer to things as 1337 as slang for cool... and often times people would create nicknames using the number-letter replacements. The most common replacements are 7=T, 2=R, 3=E, 4=A, 5=S, 0=O, 1=L or I, 6=G
this predated the similar teenage txting "ur kewl, I h8 u" shit... and personally, I think this is what marked the death of 1337speak because it went from "hacker" to "kiddie"

It's actually not possible... the coins can be mixed with clean coins and there's no way of knowing when a coin was transferred between two addresses in the same wallet or between two different people. If you try and blacklist an address, it's much more likely you'll hurt someone innocent than anything else. It can't be done with any reasonable amount of certainty.

well, no. I haven't been following all this too closely, but there are 0.031337 transactions that go back much further... and all the talk of dust leads me to believe that there were just a bunch of addresses that already had this exact amount in them and those are all being collected right now.
My assumption is that whoever made all these addresses with 0.031337 coins in them was probably programming some tool and testing it with transactions of 0.031337 because programmers do silly things to amuse themselves and make the tedious part of their jobs more fun. 
But I have no idea, I wouldn't read too deep into it... especially since these original 31337 balances are pretty old.

"Highest journalistic standards"?
Maybe for a tabloid.

Explaining the point is the easiest part: No banks required.

I encourage you to look up Austrian economics, which bitcoin "is", versus Keynesian economics.

You sign all transactions on your offline machine and transmit them with your online machine. So it will look like this:
1) create the transaction with your hot wallet
2) transfer the transaction to your cold wallet, probably with a usb stick
3) sign the transaction
4) transfer the transaction back to your hot wallet
5) submit transaction to network

Satoshi was ideologically motivated, which is a more powerful thing than greed. Additionally, because the blockchain is public, we will know if any of his coins are ever spent (they haven't been).
I trust an anonymous Satoshi over any altcoin creator.

the entire mining community needs to switch to using getBlockTemplate.

I'm making the assumption that your desire to get in before the fork is so that you have both coins and can sell whichever you think everyone else is selling and make money. Problem is, this is a bubble and you don't win by buying in at the top of a bubble... The only people who stand to benefit are those who bought in before the bubble. You're too late because the bubble will negate any benefit you might get from the fork.

This is a terrible time to purchase bitcoin. You're too late to get in on the hard fork. Wait until the bubble pops.
