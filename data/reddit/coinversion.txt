Yes two different kinds of inflation but monetary inflation is very important to me to determine the integrity of a currency as to how it is created and who it benefits or disadvantages.  High levels of price inflation (many times thru monetary inflation) benefits the wealthy who own assets vs. those who only lose buying power with debased money.

I stand corrected...for some reason I had it in my head it would take longer for it to go under the Fed's target of 2%.  Great news!

If you can build something that is more open, distributed and less controlled than bitcoin please do and I'll be the first to use it.  I'm not here to get rich, I'm here to see first hand the building of a usable free market currency and I believe many of the technical issues will be solved over time.

Wouldn't it be great if there was one immutable, distributed,secure and trustless blockchain that assets could be registered on to be used as a medium of exchange between all the private "blockchains".  Best of both worlds...once in their system it could be traded with whatever rules and regs they need to comply with but the asset could be trusted enough to transfer to any private blockchain of any financial institution in the world.

Already below many large countries such as Brazil and in 8.5 years will be around 2% or less and very hard for any debt based fiat currency to compete against.

Sounds like you are confusing inflation with volatility.

Buy target or best buy gyft.com card and then buy Netflix gift card.  Curious myself, does Netflix require a credit card for sign up when using a gift card?

Yep, and with a multi Sig financial asset it would be very hard to pull off a Bernie Madoff ponzi scam if the asset could be verified and trust distributed by multiple key holders like a husband, wife and financial advisor or broker/dealer.
