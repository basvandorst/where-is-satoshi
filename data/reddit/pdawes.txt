Yeah unfortunately because it's shrouded in technology people see something that's analogous to someone losing their money by keeping it in an insecure bank as a problem inherent to the the currency.

You know the purpose of Bitcoin is to burn the state to the ground right?
@_date: 2019-07-02 06:13:55
Cuz it's Satoshi's wallet and he's been missing for years.

Ah shit I had no idea. I haven't been checking my statements that closely. How much percentage wise? How do I dump US Bankcoin

The thought of all those people whose governments betrayed them and destroyed their lives and livelihoods saving their wealth and even getting rich off an illegal asset that can't be taken from them warms my heart. This is who bitcoin is really for, not westerners trying to get rich quick.
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:55:49
It's never really a good call to trade your stored wealth for a depreciating asset, but if it's a necessity and you have no other way to pay for it then yeah probably.

He didn't call it a scam per se, I watched the interview and it was actually surprisingly reasonable. He said the technology was promising but the current price increase reflected a speculative bubble, which is pretty likely to be the case. The CEO of JP Morgan is the one who called it a scam.

I would prefer to reduce the amount of "to the moon" speculative bullshit and focus on the actual revolutionary potential of this technology. This isn't a trading sub.

Yeah but you'd also have been a complete dummy to invest half your life savings in such a volatile emerging technology that could have been worthless in months so I wouldn't be too hard on yourself.

My fan theory is that Satoshi was actually John Titor the whole time, executing an elaborate plot to save us from world war and enrich himself in his future-past.
@_date: 2018-12-29 09:53:44
Silkroad had all kinds of things like that. Clothes, books, sunglasses, laptops (some cool privacy-enabled custom builds). Didn't have to be illegal stuff. I remember seeing one of those devices that emergency vehicles have, that IR remote for traffic lights to make them turn green. I regret not buying it tbh.

I think people with enough savings to consider sequestering their money in other currencies would have the resources/personell to understand bitcoin as an option. I think your average joe may still be more likely to stuff cash in the mattress or buy gold or something.

My band has decided we will accept pay-what-you-want sales in Bitcoin for our upcoming full-length. We certainly won't move as much as Louis CK, but Bitcoin seems like a promising way to empower artists who can't break into the more centralized business models.

I don't know about you but the lion's share of my taxes goes towards militarily oppressing the planet; hardly feels like a patriotic exercise, feels more like feeding a beast I didn't vote for.
