You do not  technically own the rights to your coin 
Coinbase is not a wallet - It is an exchange
 When you own/control your key then you can claim an equal amount of the other coins when hardforks happens

googled the answer:
Re: 1 satoshi = 1 US cent? In next 5 years?
if 1 Satoshi becomes 1 cent, then the market capitalization will become close to $17 trillion. That would mean that the market cap of Bitcoin is almost three times that of gold. Also, at least 6% of the global wealth will be in the form of Bitcoins solely.
