I don't need it to hit 3k, I just need it to hit 10,500 by January 26th so I can get paid on all the futures contracts that came out back in December.

Is Bitcoin really not duplicable?
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:20:45
Waits until Bitcoin is under major dip, calls it weak.

How does OP's mind work?
@_date: 2019-07-01 15:29:57
I remember that!
@_date: 2019-07-08 17:05:55
Exactly, people who trade shorts and longs have twice as many options as people who just go long (or hold).
@_date: 2019-07-01 15:29:43
Is this about price?

The BCH subreddit claims that r/bitcoin censor comments like this.

Coinbase processed my credit card purchase in under 2 minutes.
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:42:39


I have no idea... Many people claim it would be censored.
@_date: 2018-08-03 00:50:42
Oh, that's correct, I was wrong.
@_date: 2018-08-02 21:17:26
Another example of his reliability. Perhaps you are actually more concerned with validity? 
EDIT: I was wrong.
@_date: 2018-08-02 19:30:18


Sure. Breitbart is reliably conservative. Alex Jones is reliably crazy. I can rely on Alex Jones to act wild on any show of his I watch.

This is why the (former) FBI Director recommends [putting tape over your webcam](  
I recommend electrical tape because it is black.
@_date: 2018-10-11 22:50:57
Lol, later you're going to get an email, "give me all you Bitcoin or I'll release this tape of you waving to your computer!"
@_date: 2018-10-11 23:05:30
Pssst, I can get you some BTC in under 24 hours.

@_date: 2018-06-25 15:54:11
I agree with you, except on the 20b number. I think closer to 35b or 40b and that's if BTC can just adopt the changes already written into LTC or BCH. I don't understand how either of those can do so well by making small changes to BTC, but BTC won't make those same changes?

I do not use a VPN. I use the shortened version of my name (matt instead of matthew) to make sure that it gets delivered. Other than mailing address, they dont ask for any information.

My opinion is that 8,884 BTC is less than 1% of the daily volume.
@_date: 2019-06-23 23:07:41
So we need the government to start accepting Bitcoin for payments?
@_date: 2019-06-01 18:35:32
These large Bitcoin holders are selling massive amounts of Bitcoin off of the market through a little known London-office.

Why is jewelry not intrinsic?  
Also, gold is needed for electronics.
@_date: 2019-06-21 03:38:11
I'm not sure what that means. How is "value" determined in the phrase "intrinsic value"? Normally, value is determined by what humans think about a thing, but you're saying you have a different method?
@_date: 2019-06-23 23:05:31
By then, we'll be talking about the price of 1 Satoshi, which is more meaningful anyways. No one gives me a price in Bitcoins, they give me the price in Satoshis.

Purchases from large corporations will always collect taxes. For example, Amazon will collect taxes on all of their purchases or get shut down by the government.

The CEO of Tether and Bitfinex has a long history of lying to customers and having to appear in court in the US because of it. That's just how he operates, lie first, answer questions later.

That's your opinion, and ultimately up to the Supreme Court to decide if they want. If the Supreme Court wanted to overturn a Florida court's decision to ban a book on first amendment grounds it would become legal for them to do that.

That sockpuppet account is paid for by Roger Ver, Vladmiar Putin, and  the Illuminati!

And also make sure we focus on lowering the fees as the next step.

What happens if I steal BTC today and the price goes down significantly when I get caught?
@_date: 2018-02-27 03:16:45
And thus, a plan was born!
@_date: 2018-02-27 00:41:20
Why not? Where did you hear that?
@_date: 2018-03-07 16:23:11
I'm confused, they sold the BTC and gave people who lost their BTC the past value of their BTC, not the present day value?
@_date: 2018-02-26 20:58:07
Why would he get the value of that BTC in present day? That BTC had a specific value when it was "stolen" why not use that value?
@_date: 2019-09-18 17:04:28
Thank you, that makes sense. So will the Fed "burn" (remove from circulation) the money they lent out after the loan is complete?
@_date: 2019-09-18 01:51:25
Is that our money as taxpayers, or is it like, China's money or something?
@_date: 2018-07-24 02:33:16
Interesting, you can get a gold-linked debit card. 
@_date: 2019-09-18 04:20:14
So the Fed changed a policy? This policy only applied to money deposited with Fed? This money is called "federal funds" (I don't know what that means). What was the problem? Did the Fed create $54 Billion this morning?
@_date: 2019-09-20 00:41:09
Thanks! That is super helpful.
@_date: 2019-09-18 02:33:58
My guess is yes, there was more demand for loans than the Federal Reserve predicted.
@_date: 2019-09-18 01:50:14
I think the "liquidity shortfall" referenced in the article refers to a lack of money at the big banks to cover requests for loans. Many small businesses rely on loans a month-to-month basis. If the banks didn't have money to cover those loans, then the businesses would have a difficult time keeping operations going. That *might* be the argument anyways.
@_date: 2019-09-18 16:28:22


What is the point of putting down 100% collateral for a loan? What kind of thing is the collateral (houses, cash, IOU's, etc)?   


How does the effective federal funds rate interact with the Fed taking collateral in exchange for a loan?

I can't buy groceries with euros, I live in the US.
@_date: 2019-05-01 18:31:39
What we already knew. What they already admitted to. Bitfinex (Ifinex) and Tether are run by the same people. It's just re-emphasizing that this was a loan to themselves.
@_date: 2019-05-08 17:48:18
In some countries, you can "write-off" monies that were stolen from you in your taxes. However, since Binance is in a very new situation, I imagine the already written laws are less important than the person-to-person negotiations that they do when deciding which country they will be based in. For these kinds of negotiations, it would still be helpful to say, "we don't have much money this year, we just got robbed for $40 million".

I just signed up for Ameritrade so I can (hopefully) short Bitcion. Please ignore this data and keep pumping the price until my deposit goes through.
@_date: 2019-05-08 17:50:10
Are you sure? I thought the tax laws were different for cryptocurrency exchanges were different in the countries where Binance is located.

We could go back to the old ways of buying those moneypak cards at WalMart with cash and using them to buy BTC. I probably did that half a dozen times back when BTC was only used for...
@_date: 2019-05-31 18:40:53
I buy gold coins with Bitcoin. And there's no KYC regulations!
