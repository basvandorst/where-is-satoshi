Would it not sentralize the network somewhat if we were constantly going through Facebook's channel?

Depends on when you bought.

It just means that you should not transfer to an account you do not own, which is generally to an exchange or shady 3rd party that promise you something in return.
If fou put your friends address that is fine.

You should be aware that Bitcoin Cash (bcash) is not the same as Bitcoin. If the person you want to send Bitcoin to doesn't want bcash, then you should NOT buy bcash.

I'm working on it! What alts do you need?
@_date: 2017-11-15 08:33:49
If you download it feel free to contact me with suggestions! I'd love to get some feedback.

That's actually one of the main features that made me make this app! I haven't made it yet, as I need to find a good way of getting all the info, and scale it properly, but it is possible! 
It should be doable, as the app already pulls transactions, so i just need to implement a way to also add investments to individual transactions and pull info about price at that specific moment in time. Doable, but it might take a while before I fully implement it..

My app sort does this. You can enter your total investment and it will track your average gain. 
I'm very open to feedback, so I could start working on a feature where you can get value-feedback for each transaction. 
If you download it, feel free to give me feedback! I'm actively working on it, and I want to improve as much as possible!

Don't think, just do. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 11:41:03
Thank you! 
This app pulls information about a public bitcoin address from blockchain.info. It is not possible to get information from exchanges and other alt-coins as of now. Is that what you meant?

If you're on Android, you could give my app a shot while waiting for Blackfolio to drop. I'd love some feedback!

It may not be as beautiful as Blackfolio, but it works and it's out! Notifications coming soon.

You could give my app a shot. It's fairly straight forward. I'm also very open to feedback, so feel free to give me an honest review!

What started out as a little pet project after work has turned into a little pet project I would like to share with all of you guys! I wanted a simple app with no need for authentification that would just track my balances and the total value. It is completely free as well! 
It is available for [Android]( and I would love some feedback! Currently only supports Bitcoin addresses, but I'm working on including other alt-coins as well. Notifications are coming too! 
@_date: 2017-11-15 11:01:54
Here's a quick [GIF]( of what happens when you click on one of the addresses!

Blockchain.info 
Looking into other blockchain explorers for both Bitcoin and other alts. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:59:37
I'm working on including as many as possible, but I was mostly working on getting something out and getting feedback. I launched on Sunday haha. 
Recent transactions are built in of course. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 09:49:04
My app does this as well. No authentification required, just scan your public QR code from blockchain.info. 
Let me know if you have any feedback! I'd love to hear from you!

@_date: 2017-11-15 10:00:52
Thank you!! Pretty happy about how it turned out. Realized some people don't like dark themes, so I have a normal theme as well. If you have any more feedback, let me know!

Paper Wallets are great, as long as you can keep the physical paper in a safe place and keep it from degrading. 
It's one of the main reason why a trezor/ledger nano is recommended, as the wallet can be regenerated using your passphrase should anything happen to it. 
Treat your paper wallet like physical cash; keep it safe and out of reach. Keeping several wallets can also be recommended, as transferring funds from one paper wallet means scrubbing that address. That specific wallet should then never be reused.

VPN.ht also takes crypto, and is Hong Kong based. You can try a month for $1.
