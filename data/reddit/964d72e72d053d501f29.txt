There is one way you can spend bitcoin without paying taxes now (If you live in the US) and that is by using Last In First Out method.
Then you can buy 1000$ of bitcoin today, then immediately spend it on a hamburger, leaving the original 1k investment and 1k profits untouched.
But if you spend after the price has increased/decreased you will pay taxes on that difference.

If you saw the 10x increases you have also seen bitcoin lose 80% of its price over between 2013 and 2015. If you have to sell BTC to pay interest in the coming years in a similar scenario you may not be able to benefit from any future growth of Bitcoin.
If you pay of your 19% interest debt you will still be able to buy bitcoin regularly from the money you save up every month, and you will be able to hold it for decades without having to sell it at bad times to pay off your interest.
If you believe that bitcoin will grow 25% every year over the next 15 years you will not miss out on much percentage wise by investing regularly every month. Only if you know that Bitcoin will rise 1000% the next year and then stop growing does it makes sense to not pay down a 19% debt, but nobody knows.

4: Depends on how you calculate it, do you include the operational cost of the minting/banking/transportation and handling of money. In bitcoins case the energy usage will always be proportional to the market cap of the currency, if the price falls by 90% we will see a similar reduction in energy consumption in mining.
As a sidenote, every economic activity uses energy and contributes to global warming. But economic and technological progress can unlock energy that actually reduces global warming. Example using cost effective solar energy for Carbon dioxide removal (or Fusion/Thorium, fingers crossed).

Pay down your 19% interest debt before making any investments.
Even if Bitcoin grows on average 25%+ per year you will be better off paying of your debt now and gradually putting your savings into investments.
You are not banking on BTC keeping its value, you need it to grow consistently over years unless you want to be forced to sell it off to make down payments.
If BTC goes under you may become indebted for life, that is a way higher price to pay than being debt free and not having as much wealth.

You only pay Net Capital Gains.
Each trade is registered as a loss or a gain.
At the end of the year you tally up the total amount of Gains and subtract the total amount of Losses.
The total increase in gains is what you are taxed for.
If you just hold you do not pay any taxes until you sell, anything held over a year get preferential tax treatment (long term capital gains).
If you actively trade you pay short-term capital gains, but only on the total you increase your portfolio with after subtracting the cost basis (what you paid for the crypto of your own money).

Correct, but it is the sum of all the gains minus the sum of all the cost for all trades that is taxed for each year.
You do not pay the capital gains tax each time you trade, you post it in your tax return and only pay taxes on the total net capital gains.
Every trade is a taxable event, but you only pay tax on the total net capital gain.

Bull and Bear are adjusted daily.
It is the daily percent change over time that counts.
If the price goes down 10% every day for a month, the price will only be 4.2% of the original, but the bear would have made 10% increase on their investment every day.
So they end up with around 1700% return on their investment before taking gearing into account.
Which is how bears can make money as long as the market is going down no matter how low it goes, it can always go down some extra percent per day.

The machine costs something, and it will take some number of days to make the cost of the machine back, whatever the machine does.
Unless you have some sort of hardware tech that nobody else does, you will only make a portion of the cost of the machine every month. Because other people are also able to buy that machine and use it the same way you are.
The more people join in with machines, the less the profit per person with a machine will be, until the profits gets so low that it takes a number of months or years to make the cost of the machinery back.
If you bought a machine for 1000$ that earned you 100$ a day, you could just buy another machine ten days later, then double the amount of machines every 10 days from the daily profits. Which is why you will never be able to make any sort of substantial income from buying and running machines as long as other people are able to buy and run the machines as well.

It's basic economics.
Your original question was: Can I use a machine to earn non-trivial money in the Lighting Network.
That is an economic question, not a techincal question.
And the answer is: No, you can only ever make a portion of the cost of the machinery per day when running a machine for whatever purpose, no matter how technical that purpose is, unless you have a monopoly on the machinery or cheaper machines/electricity than the rest of the population.
Because other people will be able to buy and run the machine as well, and the extra supply of machinery will drive down the profits of the other machines.
This was true back in 2010 when people mined bitcoins on their computers, they got a lot of bitcoin then, but each bitcoin then could only be sold for some cents, so they only made a couple of cents for every bitcoin they mined.
You can use a machine to get a small dollar amount of crypto today, and that crypto may increase in price over time, but you will on average be better of by just buying that crypto directly when you factor in the cost of the machinery and electricity - unless you have access to cheaper machines and cheaper electricity than everybody else.

If people come in based on hope, they will fly away when they met fear. The same people that stay away from bitcoin because of fear will come flocking when they feel hope.

There is a limited amount of supply (Storage space in the block) and a larger amount of demand (more people that want to transact than there is space for).
It does not matter how many or few miners are running, the amount of space per block is fixed.
The only way transaction costs will go down is if there are fewer people who are interested in transacting (lower demand) or if there more space to store transactions (higher supply) or more efficient ways to store the transaction information in the block (higher supply).
Decentralization requires that it is possible to store a copy of the whole blockchain in many places. The larger the blocksize, the fewer places will be able to store it and the more centralized it becomes.

You can check it out with mining calculators.
How long it takes depends on the current price and difficulty.
Today you could get 30+ USD per day, for 4k it would take around 2-5 months. But that is assuming this difficulty and price.
The lower the profit margins become per day, the more important the price of electricity becomes.
When the price goes down or the difficulty increases faster than the price over time it eventually comes to a point where only those with access to the cheapest electricity turns a profit.
My guess would be that it takes a between 1-2 years to pay it off if you run 24/7 and have cheap electricity.

One thing that is often glossed over here.
Bitcoin could easily lose 90% of its current price for many years and the cryptocurrency market may already have reached its peak even if all that you write is correct.
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:09:50
The cost would be the same, just a different implementation.
If the miners took their own fees, no matter the cost of that fee, they would pay 0 bitcoin per byte and earn 0 bitcoin per byte and they would lose the potential fee they could have gotten of the current max rate.
Paying 5 satoshi to yourself is the same as paying 300 satoshi to yourself, the end result is the same, you remove part of the storage in the block you mined and you lose out on the current top rate that you could otherwise have gotten.
If the miners fill the block with 20% of their own (or cheapest) transactions they would need the top real transaction cost to be 25% higher. If they fill up 90% of the block themselves they need the transaction cost for the remaining 10% to be 10 times larger.
If it is the case that reducing the available space for regular transactions with 50% makes the average transaction cost go up with more than 100% it makes short term sense for a miner collusion if they together hold a large majority. But they would have more to gain from collectively switching their hashpower from coin to coin to manipulate the markets from the inside.

The way people influence the price of bitcoin other than direct market manipulation is to speak publicly about it.
If a known investor shorts bitcoin for a large amount it sends a signal that they believe that bitcoin will fall in price, that could make people more anxious to sell.
But the same is true the other way as well. Someone could say that they are willing to buy bitcoin for 25k in a year because they are certain that the price will rise to over 100k.

Does not matter, it is functionally the same.
People will have no incentive to use bitcoin to buy stuff unless they are offered a rebate and have the taxes done without an hassle, and retailers will not do that unless it attracts customers that otherwise would not have paid using the standard currencies.
Imagine if bitcoin reaches 100k, then everyone starts buying houses, paying bills and shopping using bitcoin. The price of bitcoin will start to drop, which will in turn pressure people to buy more things using bitcoin before the price drops more, which will make the price drop more.
This is part of the reason why regular currency has inflation, so that people are pressured to invest it or spend it instead of sitting on it in hopes of it increasing in value.

When the price of electricity is higher than buying bitcoin directly they will shut down their miners. When it rises above what they can buy for money they will start their miners.
The fewer miners there are, the more profit there is per miner for those who are left, so the amount of miners will reach some equilibrium.
They will most likely not turn off their miners, but they will shift them to something else than bitcoin. If there are no other coins they can mine than bitcoin there will just be less mining.

Even those buying at the worst time at 2013 would have made average returns of 50% per year by today.
Even if the price crashes down to 2k in 2018 and stays there the people who bought at 1k in 2013 would still have a respectable 15% average annual return.
As long as people do not view it as short term speculation it is no financial problem that the price drops by 90% over years. As long as bitcoin lives it will over time have an average annual growth.
Even if someone only buys at every bitcoin top and never sells they may still realize a 10%+ yearly return over decades.
The question is if bitcoin will survive the next decades.
Just do not plan on making a living in the short term by buying and selling bitcoin and crashes becomes a non concern.
The longevity of bitcoin however may come under attack from the groups that are interested in keeping it up against those who wish it to go under.

Nothing is like-kind outside of very narrow circumstances, property used in industry, like machines, and the house you live in.


Same with cash/currency, anything that is not explicitly a house you live in yourself or machinery/property that you use in industry for industry.
So if you have a Bitcoin Mining Business that owns and runs some Antminer s7, you can trade an Antminer s7 for an Antminer s9 and it will be like-kind as long as you use it for the same purpose and in your business actively.
If you just have a Antminder s7 sitting around, not in use in your industry, you can **not** trade it for a Antminer S9, as that is not like kind. You need to actually use it in the industry, not trade it for the sake of realizing capital gains.
The reason people say that crypto is like-kind, is because they want it to be true, and because they can not find the text that says: "Crypto is not like-kind". But it is impossible to find a list of things that are "not like-kind" since that about covers absolutely everything. That is why the goverment came out and said it directly, because enough people had the misconception about like-kind.

From an investment/speculation perspective it does not matter what is good and true, only the relative changes in prices over set time frames. The cryptomarket as a whole is what dictates the potential profits for those who are investing in crypto and short term traders loves volatility.
As long as the price or market cap is seen as the metric of success it will be a zero sum game where the gain of one is the loss of another.
The moment your financial situation is tided to the success of an underlying asset, you are automatically disadvantaged from having a balanced view free from stress and partiality.
Bitcoin has a special place in many as they have followed the project for years on years and while the idea of fresher newer projects filling out the market is fine, but the situation with bitcoin cash feels more like an usurper that aims to replace bitcoin instead of complementing it. At least from the perspective of those who are on team bitcoin.
For the average crypto supporter it does not matter much either way if it is Bitcoin or Bitcoin cash that takes the front seat as long as crypto as a whole keeps on growing.

Is bitcoin wasteful compared to what?
The price of something is an indication of the resources that are used to produced it, in this case energy for the machines running to mine and the energy used to build the machines themselves. But this is no different than everything else. If the price of bitcoin goes down, so will the amount of electricity and machines that is used to mine it.
But if we go down that road everything eventually goes back to the ability to gather and use energy from the sun and atoms.

There is an amount that is to small when it comes to bitcoin currently if you buy it and send it to your own wallet, and that is when the bitcoin purchased is close to the transaction fee.
A wallet that has a hundred 1 dollar transactions into it will pay a premium when trying to spend it compared to a wallet that got a single 100 dollar transaction.
When buying on exchanges it does not matter, then there is either a percent fee and/or credit card fee, it is possible to transfer it out in one go at a later point.

A easy way to compare the different market caps that Bitcoin is often bench marked against, enjoyed the simple design, straight to the point.
A nitpick would be that there is a risk-adjusted price in investments when the probability is low that is lower than the fixed percentage of the chance.
Let's say you want to buy an acre of land and you can not survey it beforehand, guaranteed good soil goes for about 1 million per acre, bad soil goes for 0.9 million and if the soil contains undiscovered gold you get 100 million.
If there is a 99% probability that a acre of land has good soil you will be willing to pay close to one million for it.
If there was a 1% chance of there being gold in not be willing to pay 2 million for it but closer to for example 1.2 million to compensate for the high risk of there not being gold there.
You could add in the formula for risk adjusted return (Sharpe ratio) if you want to build upon it.

Another reason would be that once the price breaks a certain threshold like 12k it tends to grow even more.
Some who trades actively is can be interested in the percent change in the short term. They will buy 12 100 and plan to sell at a slightly larger price if they are sure that it will rise upwards for a short while.
The price will likely drop down below 12 again and then they might buy even more.

When one block if found the miner can chose which transactions to add.
If you ran a mining pool that occasionally found blocks you could make the rule: "I will only accept transactions that are between 5 and 10 satoshi".
Then instead of getting 12.5 + 2-3 blocks you would get 12.5 + 0.05-0.1 blocks.
So you could effectively pay 20% of your potential income to pay for cheap transactions.
Which if you have free hardware and free electricity and labor would work out fine.
But if you pay 1 million a month to get 1.1 milllion in bitcoin you can't afford to donate 20% to pay for low transaction fees even if you wanted to be generous.

2015 was an exciting time for that reason, it looked like the price would actually keep somewhat stable around 200+ dollars.
There are plenty of people who are happy that they used all their bitcoin back when it was cents or single digit dollars because that was the purpose and they support the overall idea behind bitcoin more than they want to enrich themselves.

Antminer s9 will cost you around 3000 USD + Wating for it to arrive.
At current prices you will make a profit of 35 usd per day at 0.1$/kWh.
The profitability of mining is higher than usual because the price has increased faster than the difficulty. Difficulty changes as more people mine, more people mine when the price goes up, but there is some lag/delay.
The time it takes to earn back the miner can be as little as 3 months or you could mine for years and never actually cover the cost of the machine.

Past performance is ~~not~~ an indicator of future outcomes.
There was a crash in 2013 after a price increase that lasted for four years before it reached the same price level again as the ATH.
We might see a similar thing happening now, where the price will hit 20k in three or four years time on the way to its next ATH.
There is no reason to think that it is impossible that 20k is the highest bitcoin will be in years even if it survives and lives for the next decades.

From a price perspective it means that Bitcoin (and every other crypto) price will be determined more and more by its market share, for Bitcoin it is currently 38%.

Transactions are prioritized based on how much you pay per byte you send, you pay in a number of Satoshi (0.00000001 BTC) per Byte.
Those who pay less than the top rate have to wait until that rate drops.
You can see the current top rate here: 
Or you can scroll down to the bottom to where the color is Yellow/Green to see how much you need to pay now to get through: 
The current average transaction fee for bitcoin is very high, it has never been this high before, the average transaction cost in dollars is around 40 dollars now: 
There is another element which is the byte-size of the transaction.
Since you pay per byte you will pay more if you send a transaction that has a lot of bytes.
But in general the cost will be pretty close to the average byte size of an transaction which is around 250 bytes.
You may have heard of SegWit, that is a way to reduce that standard byte amount by around half by storing it differently in each block.

This is what you signed up for when you deposited your money in the bank, they do what they do because they are legally obligated to or because they are not forbidden to do it by the law, you will find the terms in the contract and in the law. Morally right or wrong, fair or unfair, does not factor into it at all.
If the bank tries to deny you your money even when you can document your income to the government, you will have to go through the court and win there.
Bitcoin and similar crypto gives you the ability to be your own bank so that you only need to keep track of your capital gains for taxing purposes. Nobody can deny you access to your crypto as long as you have the private keys/seed, but if you put your money into the bank you will have to follow their rules.
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:06:13
The reason it is classified that way is for taxing purposes and based on how it is currently used.
Bitocoin is more similar to a stock or commodity and blockchain technology is more similar as an market than a currency.
Currencies is a unit that is used for trade in one and more countries and between countries. The value of the currency is relative to all other currencies and depends on the monetary policies of the countries that have them, trade between countries and the sort of markets that use it. Petroleum being traded in USD from countries that themselves do not use USD as a national currency for example.
When people want to buy a good that is valued at 10 usd they trade bitcoin that has a market value of 10 usd, then the vendor sell that bitcoin for 10 usd on the market and registers that they have completed a sale of 10 usd. You could say that the person trades the good for 10 usd worth of bitcoin.
I could write a contract that I will me transfer ownership of a fund or asset to another person in exchange for their car. Instead of me selling the asset and buying the car for the local currency I am realizing my capital gains trough a trade, I pay taxes on what I earned on the stock. People are doing the same when they are using bitcoin, they create a contract in the blockchain with another person that they will trade their ownership of X bitcoin for a good or service, then they register the difference they paid for the bitcoin and the market price for the good that they purchased compared to what they paid in usd to get the bitcoin.
EDIT: it should be noted that if I buy 1 Euro for 1 dollar and sell that  euro for 2 dollars later i pay ordinary income taxes on the difference. Bitcoin being classified as property means lower taxes, not more.

It all depends on your electricity cost, you are only guaranteed a profit over time if it is virtually free for you.
You need a dedicated miner to mine bitcoin.
Antminer S9 is the best option for bitcoin currently costing around 3k.
Here is the problem:
* Larger total hashrate means less bitcoin per Antminer s9.
* Large price per bitcoins means more bitcoin per Antminer s9.
The growth of both have been:
* 10x for bitcoin price.
* 6x for total hashrate the last year.
When the bitcoin price grows faster than expected like this year it increases the demand for more miners, it takes time to fill that gap.
As soon as the hashrate increases faster than the bitcoin profitability per month goes down for the miners go down. The limit where electricity costs less than bitcoin will decrease. If it comes to the point where your electricity cost is larger than the price of your hashrate you will be better of just buying bitcoin directly.
You can GPU mine other currencies and trade them for bitcoin if you want to mine without making a large purchase.

What we see now is the result of a lot of speculation combined with a number of long term investors.
We could see something similar to the spike in late 2013, bitcoin topped at 1000 usd and then had a gradual decline towards 200 usd, it stayed around 2-300 for until mid 2016.
The people that come in now see that bitcoin went from 1,000 to 11,000 in one year without realizing that it peaked to 1,000 in the end of 2013 and may have a similar ride in front of us where bitcoin stays at around 25-30% of the current price for years.
Long term the question is if bitcoin will survive, and how the goverments reacts to cryptocurrency over time. It looks that bitcoin will gain legitimacy as an commodity or storage of wealth which will be legal in the US and, EU, Japan and South Korea.
Bitcoin does not need to be used for commerce for it to keep its price and have it rise over time. It only have to be perceived as a safe storage of wealth that increases at a average yearly rate that is comparable to traditional investments like stocks.

There are different groups that have different interests.
You can in a sense buy votes with mining or nodes or both no matter what your intention or wishes are. The interests of each group is not necessarily aligned with an overarching goal.
People who have a lot of bitcoin does not have the same wishes that those who have no bitcoin. Miners may have different interests than non miners. People who hold other coins may have other interest that those who hold bitcoin.

A set fee would just mean that there would be an extremely long queue. You would not pay a variable transaction fee but rather a fixed "transaction time" which would grow until people was unable to wait the weeks/months to get trough.
For it to even work in theory transactions would not be dropped ever, or else people would risk having to enter the back of the line over and over again never actually getting to the front.
It could be possible to set a global maximum fee which would get increased whenever a block had 75% of the fees being the max amount and decreased every time the block had less that 25% in the max fee.
The current system works as good as it possibly can where an increase in the demand for a limited supply (space in block) is decided by the aggregate price that users are willing to pay.

Nobody knows if the price will go up or down or when it goes up or down.
So while it looks easy looking back, seeing the tops and bottoms, in reality most people that try to buy on the top and sell on the bottom seldom do better than the market and often lose out compared to what they would have if they just kept their investments.
It is more common to predict trends over longer time periods, like if the price will increase the next week/month or not.

The government does not know how much cash or bitcoin you have lying around. But they do know how much your net worth is outside of cash and bitcoin and your total life income from labor and capital.
If you spend more than you have earned in your life to pay our debts or buy a house they will want to know where you got the money.
They can only assume that you got it by tax evasion or criminal activity and it is up to you to document where you got your wealth.
If you declare how much you spent on buying bitcoin and their current value you do not actually have to pay any taxes on the wealth. And if you cash out in the future you will pay 15% on the realized capital gains.

I would love to take it off your hands, but I am of the same persuasion that you. Even though I have the money for it, it is to heavy a burden to bear. Even if my insurance covers a burglary or a house fire it would be a shame to be responsible for not keeping it for the future. It would be tempting to donating it to a museum just to not have that responsibility weighing on my shoulders.
You may be able to lend it to a museum with some sort of contract/insurance where you would be able to claim it back or get compensation if the coin is lost. It could give you the right but not obligation to claim it back or let them purchase it from you at a future date if you get into financial troubles.
Edit: From the sound of it you are a great owner, the coin was lucky to get you as her steward.

In April bitcoins was already 1.2k.
I am curious to how you managed to earn several thousand dollars online by other means. What sort of online activity pays thousands of dollars in bitcoins.
Anyways, nobody knows the price, you can make a rule where you sell 5% of your remaining bitcoin whenever the ATH increases by 10%. Then you will have about half of your bitcoins if the price rises to 80k if you start to sell at 20k.
Or you can decide that you sell whatever amount is over 30k in the future.
Or you can sell 10% of whatever remains every month regardless of price.
It does not make much difference, because no matter what you chose you could always have made a better choice when looking back, but it is impossible to know beforehand.
Bitcoin could reach 80k, then drop down to 30k where you decide to cut your losses, just for it to spike back up to 100k in the coming months.
It comes down to your personality and if you rather go all inn towards the moon or ground, or if you prefer to sell some now and some later.

Historically, over long periods of time, the value of gold stays the same adjusted for inflation.


The total amount of gold that can be mined cost-efficiently is fixed, there is still at least 30%+ more gold that could be mined, but that number will drop towards zero over time, you could extract it from the ocean but that would be prohibitively expensive.


For now, that can be changed in the future (unlikely, but the code can be changed if there is a will for it).


Just like gold there is a fixed supply, the first tonnes of gold (bitcoin) was easy to find (mine), then over time it gets harder and harder as there is less gold/bitcoin left and it takes more work to get each. The amount of work (machines/miners) that is done is set by the price of gold/bitcoin which is determined by supply and demand and the growth of the economy as a whole.
What bitcoin and gold have in common is that they price is for the most part a reflection of the trust people have that other people will value and be willing to trade it at a similar or higher price in the future.
Gold is often called a thousand year bubble, as the material itself is not that useful to warrant the price, only the demand for it because of its historical price stability.
Bitcoin derives its current price from the fact that those who hold it perceive it as safe and that the price will stay or increase over time. There does not actually need to be any other reason to buy gold or Bitcoin.

You can buy bitcoin on an exchange like coinbase or you can buy it directly from others from localbitcoins.

You can compare the market cap and historical prices here: 
If you are only investing in bitcoin as a way to store value over time there is little to no difference between bitcoin and bitcoin cash, their price will fall and rise depending on which is more in demand. You can store them both by having a private code that you can use to spend the bitcoin in the future.

It has to do with the blockchain itself.
There is a limited amount of transactions per hour.
There are more people who want to transact than there is space in the blockchain.
So people have to pay extra to get in the front of the line.
The average transaction is thousands of dollars currently, so a 30 usd fee is not much for those sums, but for smaller sums it is extremely expensive.
The cost is very high currently because people are flocking to bitcoin, but once demand goes down it will calm down.

You need to keep a record of all the trades you ever made.
The price is calculated at the cost price and the sale price using one of two ways to calculate the difference, (First in First Out) or (Last in, First Out).
You will have to pay the maximum tax rate even if you have 0 income other than bitcoin since you traded actively. You can expect to owe 12,5k in federal taxes now with 50k gains, and maybe some state/local taxes, even if you do not sell any Bitcoin.
You may want to consider getting professional help with the accounting and taxation since you have run a large operation.
The easiest way to calculate the total tax is total cost of buying the initial bitcoin, and the total you have in bitcoin today, but you still need to account for every trade you made if they ask for it, why they may do since it is such a large amount and you did active trading.
If BTC flops, and you sell, you will get symmetrical tax breaks, but they can only be realized 3k every year.
Buy 2 BTC for 1000 dollar each.
Sell 1 BTC for 11000 dollar, you pay 25% tax, 2.5k
New Year
Sell last 1 BTC for 100 dollar, you get 25% of 900 dollars back, 225  dollars in tax breaks.
If you put 1000 dollars into bitcoin, trade actively so you have 100k in bitcoin, you pay 25k in taxes that year.
If you paid with your Bitcoin you now have 75k in bitcoin that you have paid taxes on, if the price crashes to 1000 dollar you get back around 19k in taxes.
If you had paid the taxes in cash you would get back around 25k in taxes if bitcoin crashed.

You are not taxed based on the USD amount but the value gain and every trade you make realizes the gain or loss, no USD need to be involved.
2017 trades:
* 01.01 Buy 1 Bitcoin at (10$ marketprice)
* 02.02 Trade 1 Bitcoin it to a 10 Litecoin (20$ marketprice)
* 03.03 Trade 10 Litecoin back to 1 Bitcoin (40$ marketprice)
* 04.04 Trade bitcoin for Gold coin (100$ marketprice)
* 05.05 Trade Gold coin back to bitcoin (50$ marketprice)
Then you will post:
* 02.02 Realized Capital Gain (20-10) 10 USD
* 03.03 Realized Capital Gain (40-20) 20 USD
* 04.04 Realized Capital Gain (100-40) 60 USD
* 05.05 Realized Capital Loss (50-100) 50 USD
In you tax form you will say that you had
Total realized capital gains: 90 USD
Total realized capital loss: 50 USD
Then you will be taxed on your Gains-Loss which is for example 15% of 40USD, so this year you pay 6 USD in taxes for you realized capital gains.
Lets say you continue to trade in 2018:
You enter the year with 50 usd in bitcoin.
* 06.06 You trade your bitcoin for gold (40 USD)
* 07.07 You trade your gold for litecoin (15 USD)
* 06.06 Realized capital loss 10 USD (50-40)
* 07.07 Realized capital loss 25 USD (40-15)
Then you post total realized capital loss: 35 USD
This year your taxes is reduced by 5.25 USD.
So in total taxes you paid 6.00 in 2017 and got 5.25 in 2018.
Total paid taxes is 0.75
You started with 10 USD in bitcoin, and ended with 15 USD in litecoin, you total capital gains was 5 USD where you paid 0.75 total in taxes.
You can avoid paying capital taxes by buying Bitcoin and never ever trading it in, but if you ever trade it you will have to pay capital gains taxes on the difference of the cost of bitcoin and the value of the thing you trade bitcoin for.

Make bitcoin a currency and it only means that people have to pay more taxes on it. Ordinary income instead of property.
Every trade of something that has a market value is a realization of a capital gain (or loss), it does not matter what is traded.
If you can say that something has a price it is taxed when traded.
The reason we are able to trade items in MMOs for in-game currency is because we are not allowed to actually sell it for anything other than other MMO assets. Doing that would be a ban and tax evasion. Crimes both in the game world and real world. The company can sell you items in the game and pay taxes on their profits.
Let's say that there is a MMO that lets you sell items for something outside the game world on a player-to-player real money market, you will run into the problem of having to tax the in-game world.
* Buy an ingame sword for marked value 10 dollars from another player.
* Get an item drop with that sword market price 5 usd.
* Sell the sword once the market price increases for 20 dollars.
You just realized a capital gain on the trade and a taxable income on the item drop and when you sell or trade your drop for ingame currency or any other item you need to report that as another realized capital gain.
Even if you trade ingame currencies like gold and diamonds you need to keep a record of the market value at the time of each trade and pay capital gains taxes on them.

Bitcoin can be as alive as we are and still be in a price bubble.
You can make long term arguments for crypto and the blockchain in general, but nobody knows what the future holds for bitcoin in particular. And absolutely no-one knows what the price development will be in the short or long term.

You can mine altcoins using GPUs, there is a site called whattomine that lets you estimate your daily profits taking your electricity into account.
At for example 2-5 usd per day after electricity using a single RX 480 at the current prices. The cheaper the rest of the rig is and the more GPUs you have per computer the faster you will cover the cost of the rig. A common number of GPUs per rig is 6.
After the initial costs are recouped you may earn around 20-40 usd per 6 GPU rig per day if you leave them on 24/7.
Depending on the prices of the coins or the effectiveness and price of newer graphics cards and compared to the cost of electricity you may earn next to nothing or lose money over the long run.
Worst case scenario is that your setup mines less coins that the cost of electricity due to price changes. You can always sell the parts or rigs on the used market but you will lose some money. It is not a safe bet.
You have to enjoy building, maintaining and number of heat generating buzzing machines that run 24/7. It can go from a fun side project to part time job fast.
The profits will not be spectacular and if you plan on scaling it up to where it becomes comparable to an job you may not be able to combine it with full employment without starting to hire people to manage your rigs.

People who get into stressful financial situations are on average less able to handle stress, they have lower than normal stress tolerance and keep themselves more in line than when they are financially secure. One of the the largest indicators of crime of this sort is a high stress tolerance which paradoxically may be the result of being financially secure and having a feeling of invulnerability.

This is the reason I want to see Bitcoin Cash actually being used, for example in the remittance market.
If they increase the block size every time the blocks gets consistently full we will actually see how long each increase in block size takes to fill up as adoption increases.
As long as people know that it will not be cheaper to send tomorrow than today and that the transaction is fast and secure, it will come to gradually dominate the remittance market.
We may actually see where the limits of current bandwith/storage is when it comes to blockchain, and it would be a good proof of concept.

A 20% increment every year could work, it would mean a doubling every 4 years or so. We do not know the price elasticity of bitcoin block space. If a decrease of 10% in fees makes 25% more transactions viable we will only ever see small decreases in fees from large increases in block size.
If we want stability and reducing the risk of voliatility we would all encourage each other to **not hold** bitcoin. Or at least to put our own economic interest aside and not speculate in bitcoin, the more people use bitcoin for commerce, the lower the price will be (or at least the growth will slow down compared to pure speculation).
The price normalizing around 1k per bitcoin and staying there for years on years with no sign of it ever increasing or decreasing (adjusted for inflation) may make Bitcoin fulfill the role of a **stable** store of value and a peer-to-peer cash system.

What is wrong with Bitcoin having been in a price bubble?
It is the long term development, health and longevity of bitcoin and crypto in general that has the true value, not any short term explosive growth.
Even if bitcoin drops to 2k at the end of they year its long term growth will still be exceptionally good over time and it the trend of doubling every year since 2014 holds true.
If that underlying average trend continues we will be headed for 16k in 2021 and 100k+ in 2024. There is no rush, and at some point the price will become stable and crypto may become something that is used for its own sake instead of it being a way to earn money by holding.

Correct, bitcoin is designed to circumvent thrust by having everyone compete verify everyone else by design. But it is the aggregate perception of bitcoins security and longevity from all individuals combined with the government policies in all countries and perception of competing stores of value that ultimately will decide the price point.
A large reason that bitcoin spiked in 2013 was because the Cyprus government stole a large percentage of money from all citizens banks, the citizens lost thrust in the banks and switched to bitcoin.

If there are more people who want to transact than there is space the queue would grow longer and longer every day. It would spiral into weeks and months of waiting fast making bitcoin completely unusable for everybody.
The only way to prevent a super queue would be to have a high fee for everyone so that there at no point was more than a number of hours in queue but that could easily end up in blocks not being filled when there was less traffic.
It would possible to increase the price to get in the back of the line the longer the queue was, that would prevent long queues from forming but it would just mean that you had to pay extra in addition to waiting extra.

The best would be to hold the investment over one year, then you get the long term property gains tax which is lower than the short term.
Up to a total income of 38k usd per year you pay 0% federal taxes on long term capital gains.
From 38k to 200k you pay 15%.
200k+ you add another 3.8% NIIT surtax.
Short term investments are taxed at ordinary income, higher tax rate and less preferential tax bracket treatment.
The moment you trade or sell you bitcoin you have to pay tax on the realized capital gains, so you can't sell your bitcoin on at trade and pay taxes when you withdraw it, you need to hold the bitcoin until one year has passed, then sell it.

That is not an example of hate speech. That is a different law that covers incitement of violence or conspiracy to commit violence.
Hate speech would be denying or even questioning aspects of the holocaust or saying that there are genetic differences between races that is reflected in the average intelligence political leanings or temperament, that Islam and western civilization is incompatible, or saying that you view homosexuality or as an mentally illness.
All of which is disagreeable things to express, but they are still illegal to post online for most of EU and there are a lot of people every day that get visits from the police because of expressing their political views without inciting to violence or crimes of any kind (other that speech crimes themselves).
Time will show how it plays out, but if you have access to a public court document database you can search through the hate speech section and see for yourself, I did and realized what people actually get convicted for.
If you are of the conviction that you are free to express all sorts of viewpoints short of inciting to violence you may be right, I do not know which country you live in (and do not want to know) but I hope you live a place where that is the case.

You are correct, thanks for the correction.
It is even lower than the highest tax bracket at 200 adjusted gross income and 250 for married.
That is a real bummer as it at first glance look like a surtax that is only used for certain cases when the reality is that there are only some few exception to the rule.
I understand why they did it that way, if they had increased the capital gains tax from 15 to 18,8% for gross income at 200k and increased from 20 to 23.8% it certainly feels like the real capital gains tax increase that it is.

In the start of 2013 bitcoin was in the low 10s starting at 13 usd.
In the middle it was fluctuating around 100 usd.
There was a shortlived spike where it went above 1000 around november.
Someone that bought in the start of the year and sold near the end of november the same year would have made close to a 100x increase.

You do not want to be "a true believer" when making investments with the goal of making long term returns.
If you are a true believer in bitcoin it is not a question of making profits or losses but rather voting for bitcoin with your wallet. A 90% pricefall and bitcoins survival is better than cashing out at a 10x price increase before bitcoin crashes and burns.
This is a subreddit dedicated to bitcoin, most people here are interested in getting more people aboard and personally invested in the health and longevity of bitcoin, and the quickest way to make people care is to have them put their money into it.

Futures are an extra tool that makes it possible to use bitcoin as a currency without worrying about price fluctuations.
Lets say that I want to pay someone 1 bitcoin for holding a presentation in one year, I know that the seats for the presentation will net me 12k and I earn 2k if I can buy a bitcoin for 10k.
I can make an contract that says: I will buy 1 bitcoin in one year for 10k usd.
One or more investors can enter the contract and say that that when I buy a bitcoin in one year they will cover/get the difference.
If the price of bitcoin has dropped to 6k I will buy a bitcoin for 6k and pay the contract holder 4k. In total I paid 10k and got one coin, the investor gained 4k.
If the price of bitcoin has risen to 20k I will buy the coin for 20k and the investor will pay me 10k, I still pay 10k for the coin and the investor loses 10k.
The presenter can do the same, he can say that he is willing to sell a bitcoin in one year for 10k, then it works the same only in the other direction.

So how did you manage to mine over a million dollars of bitcoin in 2014?
If you did serous mining in 2010-2012 there was a chance that you could amass thousands of bitcoin, but that would require a level of planning and discipline that would be incompatible with having a million dollars backed up to a hot wallet on your phone without any seed or private key.
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:33:55
You can go through the historical chart and see when Bitcoin had the same number of transactions that Bitcoin Cash has now, which was around January 2014 (50k per day). At that time the average transaction cost for Bitcoin was around 10 cents.
The market cap for Bitcoin Jan 2014 was around 9 Billion, compared to the 46 Billion that Bitcoin Cash has today.
That was before the blocks where consistently full in Bitcoin, so the miners set the minimum fee they where willing to include in blocks.

There is a lot of coins and projects.
There is a market cap for all crypto, if that increases both Bitcoin and Bitcoin can increase in price. If the market cap does not increase they can still increase a bit in price, but then other altcoins need to decrease in price. If the market cap goes down then we will likely see all coins decrease in price, some more than others.

You almost never see an explanation that you have to document every purchase and sale using bitcoin and register all capital gains and losses in your tax return using FIFO or LIFO if you plan on staying a law abiding citizen.
The easiest way to use bitcoin is to buy it at some interval, document the total cost of buying, then one day decades in future sell it or donate it to a charity that is exempt for the capital gains tax.

There is wide consensus that we are somewhere between the media phase and the delusion phase. I would put the probability around "Enthusiasm" closing in on greed.
Which is to say that I am still bullish in the short term but expect there to be a lasting drop below 10k in the coming months or at least during 2018. Before that the price may get close to 40k.
But for everyone that tolerates a lot of risk there is always the possibility to invest in markets that have a good return on investment adjusted for risk long term. The standard return on investment is around 10%+ per year before inflation and around 7.5%+ after adjusting for inflation.
Bitcoins return on investment adjusted for risk has been extremely good: 
An sudden influx of money or a sudden destruction of money in a family can cause a lot of problems, lottery winners are on average worse of than their non-winning counterparts after three years. Investing some money into bitcoin and losing 50% of it may give a person the necessary life lesson that lets them avoid liquidating their assets and pension and putting all their eggs in a basket.
For those who purchased bitcoin to use because of the cyberpunk feel in the past it is no worries that the price increases, they do not beat themselves up. I got my hopes up in 2014 that 200-300 usd would finally become the stable price which would let me actually use bitcoin without having to worry about it increasing in price (as strange as that sounds).
I fear that a lot of people will learn that peace of mind and modest and predictable living gave them something that sudden wealth can take away from them without there being a way back. People say that they want to be rich but it is hard to imagine that feeling rich and being rich are not the same thing and that there is no easy way back from an inflated lifestyle or the potential alienation that comes with sudden wealth.

It would to little to nothing about the memory pool.
Currently when there is a price increase in bitcoin that is larger than the difficulty adjustment, there is more mining directed at Bitcoin, which generates the blocks a little bit faster. But that works the other way as well, when the price decreases after a difficulty adjustment some miners switch to other currencies and the block time is a bit longer. On average over time it averages out.
The only situation where it could have a strong effect would be if there was a large coordinated and sustained switch from bitcoin to (for examp) bitcoin cash after a difficulty adjustment.
A small example of a large (but short) switch of hash power after a difficulty switch was November 10th this year:

Trading from Litecoin to USD is realizing capital gain. People here wish it is not so, but it is. Like-kind trade never applied for crypto. It could apply for mining hardware used in industry to mine crypto, but not the crypto itself.
You have 300k net realized capital gain 2017.
You have 300k net realized capital loss 2018.
Since there is a 3k limit per year for deducting losses for property you will to have a small deduction the next 25 years unless you realize a 300k gain in 2018.
If you have property like crypto you will be better of realizing equal amounts of gains and losses the same year to avoid having to pay a lot of taxes now and only get some small deduction for years in the future.

But good luck trying to convey the BlockChain as anything other than a public ledger with an immutable record that is verified by a distributed network of computers verifying that the block that is added is consistent with the chain, then a distributed network of machines run a new hash function every new block and get the hash that corresponds to a low number that is set by a difficulty that is adjusted based on the total number of computing power the last two weeks on average. Plus block rewards, block size restrictions, variable fees, SegWit and lightning network. It is not going to happen.
Even if they did describe it without using crypto lingo it would just come down to a network that uses a function and a lot of connected machines to secure it, where you can send and receive tokens that can be exchanged for fiat, goods or services, the transactions of which is public, impossible to change and stored forever on thousands of machines all over the world.

That something goes up compared to bitcoin does not mean that it is a good trade, it just means that it outperforms bitcoin in the timeframe. The relative percent changes from trades compared to he market as a whole is the real benchmark. Bitcoin works as an good indicator for the market and it is true most of the time.
The performance of buying a coin and sitting on it is compared to the cryptocurrency market as a whole, which bitcoin is 60%+ of. If the market share of any one coin increases it has been a good period, if the market share decreases it has been a bad period.
Altcoins could be viewed as a way to hedge a bit against bitcoin, when bitcoin drops the altcoins drops less, and when bitocin rises the altcoins rise less.
Since bitcoin tend to outperform when the market has an upwards trajectory longterm it makes sense to see the development compared to bitcoin as a benchmark, but for short term/daily trades it does not.

Bitcoin was in a price bubble in 2013, but after that bubble came after it spiraled from 100 to 1000, not when it went form around 15 usd to 100 usd the same year.
The question is not if bitcoin is headed for a price bubble, there is only a question of when, will it be a reduction from 20k to 10k, or from 100k to 40k.
The price may not fall under the current price point, but the speculative nature and new money that is flowing in will at some point cause a reduction in price that would be described as one of Bitcoins many bubbles. Bitcoin still has an extremely high ROI and the risk adjusted return is extremely good as well.

For all intents and purposes there are only two differences between currency and property in the tax law.
You pay more capital gains tax on currency, ordinary income up to 25%.
You pay less capital gains tax on property, up to 15%.
If you realize a loss with property you can get a max tax reimbursement of 3000 usd per year.

It would not work.
The memory pool is 250mb now.
It takes around 1000 sat/byte to get trough.
Average transaction cost 50 usd (costs more for larger byte transactoins).
Even if there was a single 256mb block once every other day that cleared the whole memory pool it would fill up almost immediately as all the wallets would be rebroadcasting whatever was not put in the memory pool currently.
If that solution worked it would make sense to reduce the block size to 0.1 MB and have one 128mb block every day.
The current number of transactions per second is 5.43, but that is with the current 50 dollar transaction fee. Adding more block size would increase the demand to over 5.43 transactions per second as there are more people willing to pay 25 dollars for a transaction than there are 50, and there are way more that are willing to pay 1 dollar for a transaction than 25.

Banks lend money from the federal reserve at an interest rate which they lend out to businesses and individuals for an higher interest with a to earn money and compensate for risk. They only keep a fraction of what they lend out which allows more money than the interest to be created per year, which in turn increases the money supply to avoid a deflation of the currency. Part of the value added by the economic activity made possible by loans is the wages of the workers.
It is not like banks are printing money and handing it to businesses.

When buying and holding there are two factors that play in, the average rise in price in percentages and how much the price swings up and down.
The standard average growth for a year for large stocks is about 10% per year before adjusting for inflation over a long period of time.
As long as you keep only a portion of your total investments into bitcoin you can afford to take a higher risk, the risk-reward ratio has been calculated for bitcoin so far, and it is pretty good.
Investments are not about doubling your money in a year, it is about steady growth over years and decades.

You have to factor in alternative costs and inflation.
The stock market increases about 10% every year on average (before inflation), about 7% adjusted for inflation. You can expect your money to double in 10 years (adjusted for inflation) before taxation.
You will be better of having a stock with 10% yearly growth, or just follow the S&amp;P500 index, than the same stock with 5% yearly yield and 5% yearly growth.
If you invest 100 dollars today for 20 years:
* A 5% yield and 5% average growth will give you 165$ in return and 133$ in total yield. (298$ total)
* The same stock with 10% growth will give you 572 dollars in return.
Taxation is also a better/cheaper on long term holding than getting dividends that are not directly reinvested.
To get paid dividend is the same as selling some of your stocks every dividends payment. It makes sense for people who are starting to live of their investments, but if you plan on saving for 20 years so that you can live on your earnings, you will be better of by reinvesting the dividend or going for passive index funds/ETFs and stocks that do not pay dividends.

You can only ever set a price floor as high as you are willing to pay.
There is no cost free way to drop an spam low-fee other than waiting for it to drop. The time it takes to drop is longer than the fulfillment of 10+ satoshi transactions that happens a couple of times per month. Only the very lowest transaction cost are possible to spam with any high probability of being dropped without having to pay the fee.
It will always be the demand over a given price point that set the average transaction cost, whatever transaction cost that is so low that it is likely to be dropped will not have any impact other than potentially creating a buffer that prevents the transactions under them to be fulfilled. It still stands that you can only ever set a price floor on transaction similar to what you are willing to pay to spam.
You highlight a reason why it is not possible to drop transactions on demand and get the transaction cost refunded, if it was possible it would be possible to spam all transactions with a 10k+ buffer and withdraw them before they get confirmed. Ramping up the suggested price from wallets at no cost for the spammer.
But as it stands today it is only possible to set a price floor equal to the amount that a person is willing to pay out of their own pocket.
Back when 1mb was more than enough space and the average transaction was around 1-10 cent there was an unwritten rule for miners to not include transactions that was under a artificial minimum threshold to not allow someone to fill up the block by spamming in bad faith. Miners would forgo some of their individual profit by setting a minimum for the good of the blockchain size while collectively benefiting other miners and people who transacted in good faith.
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:38:55

Getting money is wrongdoing in itself, unless you earned the money using legal means and you pay taxes on it. Same with paying others money without declaring it, giving money up to 14k is tax free, but you still have to report it so that it is known that it is not payment for work.
If it was the case that you could earn money on your labor and investments, or pay others to work without having to pay any taxes, then I would agree with you that it would be wrong to presume that the money was gotten by criminal means.
But since you have to pay tax (and document) every single dollar you make for any reason, if nothing else, just to make sure that you are under the limit where you need to pay taxes. It makes sense to assume that a large sum of money is a gift (which the gift giver is legally obligated to document) or legal income (which needs to be documented for taxation both from the employer and employee) or income from crime or part of money laundering.
The upside is that if you lose money on bad investments you will save taxes on your losses, and there are tax havens in the world if you are well of that you can take advantage of.

It can take 100 days to make back a 200 dollar graphics card, after that it would be a 2 dollar a day profit for example.
Current max mining profits for a 1080 ti which cost 700 usd is 7 dollars per day, so it would take 100 days to break even and then 7 dollars per day.

If you round the amount to 1 000 000 bytes per block each an average of 100 satoshi per byte will be equal to one extra Bitcoin per block.
So whatever the block reward is you need the average transaction cost 1000 satoshi for it to be 50% of the mining reward.
Currently there are 12.5 coins per block.
If transaction costs average 1,250 satoshi per byte transactions will be half.

The higher the volume, the less variation in the price.
Futures contracts can be used to lock the price of Bitcoin over time for use in business.
If price increase is the measure of deflation you will see that different coins have different rates of deflation, and those that aim to invest or speculate in coins will chose other crypto than Bitcoin if the alternatives have a higher rate of growth.
You may see another crypto than bitcoin that has inflation built into to it.
It is the same  with regular currencies, if enough people buy a currency it will begin to experience deflationary pressure, it is possible to print more money, but it is also possible to increase the block rewards or remove the total cap for example.

Yes, but the adress that the crypto is sent to does not have a name attached to it, you have no way of getting the money back and no way of actually proving that you did not send that money yourself.

Transaction fees are built into bitcoin itself, you pay the miners to include your transaction.
If someone sells you bitcoin online, there is something called the "Spread" which is the difference between what buyers are willing to pay for, and what sellers are willing to sell for. So you can buy bitcoin for 100 dollars and sell it for 99 dollars, even with 0 fees you will see that there is a gap between the sell and buy price.
If someone who sells bitcoin outside of an exchange wants to sell larger amounts per transaction, they can add an flat fee of X amount of dollars or set a minimum quantify they are willing to sell.
The last sort of fee is a percentage fee that the seller takes, so that larger sales remain as profitable as more smaller sales with a flat fee would.
The reason people take fees for selling bitcoin is just so that they can actually earn something from offering the service of selling, if they earned nothing it would be no reason for them to do it.

I tried to buy a single bitcoin in 2010 because I really liked the concept and wanted to have a token, but I gave up after running into disreputable websites and not wanting to risk having my information being stolen. But if I had bought one I would have sold it as soon as it became valuable enough for it to have an impact which would probably be around 2013 at the latest.
People fawn over the idea of putting in 10 dollars and getting 10k four years later, but the same people are not interested in the risk associated with the type of investments that could actually make that that happen in the future as it is extremely speculative. It is like wanting to go back in time and buying the winning numbers of a lottery ticket, or in other words just wanting wealth to spring up form thin air.
Wanting to have the reward, but not willing to take the risk.
Good news is that there is an expected yearly return of 10% per year (before inflation) and 7.5% after inflation for long regular long time investments in the stock market.

That makes sense, in the beginning of bitcoin there was a lot of goodwill towards vendors that offered payments in bitcoin.

This is part of the reason I am not to fond about the current speculation frenzy and the splits and feuds that happens between for example Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash.
To buy bitcoin because it is something that has risen in price recently could at worst cause distrust and resentment from those who burn themselves. Same with people who do not realize that there are a lot of bad actors that are looking to part them from their money.

For Bitcoin you buy a miner, connect it to a pool, then run it 24/7 until electricity is more expensive than the daily yield. Hopefully you make back the cost of the hardware before it has depreciated.
You can pay a company directly to mine for your for a period like a year, then you get paid the daily mined amount into your account.

One thing that is less speculative about bitcoin today than in the past is the fact that bitcoin is being recognized by the government as a property and large financial institutions are creating bitcoin futures and derivatives.
People who do not wish to be their own bank and are familiar with traditional investment will be able to put some of their portfolio into cryptocurrency without actually buying bitcoin.
The larger the amount of money that goes into bitcoin, the less the price will swing and the lower the potential for future growth in percent becomes.
Bitcoin attracts a lot of people who are otherwise not interested in investing who see that past performance think it is an indicator of future results.

Satoshi is 10^-8
0.00000001 BTC, a Satoshi would be 1 cent.
Rounding the numbers: An average transaction fee is usually about 200 bytes and each byte cost about 200 Satoshi.
40,000 cents per transaction, 400 dollars.
The fewer that transact, the lower the Satoshi cost per byte, the more people that transact the higher the Satoshi cost per byte to get trough within a given time.
For every 1k the bitcoin price you could perhaps expect to pay 50 cents in transaction cost give or take for a quick transaction.

If you deposit more than 10k in cash in a given bank the bank will file a currency transaction report to the IRS. This is to prevent money laundering.
But the IRS will know any account that you have money in the US even if it is less than 10k, you can not hide your money form the IRS in banks.

Man, I hope that journalists some day learn what Ponzi scheme means.
There are actual Ponzi Schemes in crypto, but that is people and companies that run fraudulent services where they pay out fake earnings based on the influx of new users.
Like me setting up a fake mining company with year long contracts where I paid out everyone from money I received from the newer customers with the plan on bailing with the money and letting everyone hang dry. That would be a real Ponzi scheme.
There is a lot of fraud and scams in crypto, but the price of Bitcoin is a result of the demand for buying Bitcoin, there is no Bitcoin Dividents (outside of hard forks) and whenever the price of anything increases over time it is true that the people that got in early benefits more than those that come in later.

* Best way to reduce risk would be to only invest for example 5% of your savings into bitcoin.
* By buying a small amount of bitcoin every month you reduce the effect of price swings over long time periods.
* The average return you can have on investments over time outside of speculation is around the standard return in the stock market of 10% before inflation. Buying a S&amp;P500 passive index fund with low fees is low risk over long periods of time.
* If you want minimal risk and volatility you can put money into money markets or buy government bonds.

Nobody uses the gold coins that they buy, other than as a hobby object, it still retains its value.
The more people actually use bitcoin for buying and selling goods and services, the lower the price increase will be.
As long as people believe that Bitcoin is completely safe, scarce and possible to buy/sell they will put money into it over time, just like they do with gold.
People buy and hold gold, not because gold gives better returns than the stock market on average, but because it will always hold some value (in the eyes of other humans) and be possible to trade.

A larger transaction (more inputs) means that you have to pay more in total since you pay a fixed amount per byte.
Your transaction has a lot of inputs, 2379 bytes worth in total, so with a 500 satoshi fee it would be around 0.0119 BTC to send it.
200 dollars to send a bitcoin transaction is pretty expensive, but you can reduce it to 20 dollars if you wait until it is possible to send 50 sat/byte transactions once the demand for transactions dies down.

IRS Notice 2014-21 lays out the federal taxes framework for bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.
The subprime mortage crisis is not comparable to bitcoin in any way.
There was made an assumption that the prices of homes would rise by an percentage many times greater than the overall economy or wages.
So the idea was to give out a lot of loans to people who had no ability to pay it back over time. When the house was possessed by the bank it would have increased so much in value that it was still a win for the issuer of the loan.
To "spread the risk" the loans was packaged into a large package and split into smaller parts that was sold with the assumption that the debt would be paid by the low-income lenders or the increase in the house value after repossession. Even if there was one district where the home prices did not increase, on average in the country it would.
These packages was split up and sold all over the world, but nobody knew what each pack consisted of, only that they where all was backed by the american housing market and they where risk free.
It turned out that it is not possible to create money by issuing debt that can't be paid to prop up a housing market that do not actually have a real demand with actual money behind it in sufficient future earnings for the lenders.
Bunch of rotten loans all over the place, global economic recession.
Bitcoin is people buying something that will rise or fall in price. It rises they get money, it falls they loses money.
If you want to lend money from the bank at a low interest to buy bitcoin they will say: No way!
If the US goverment made a law that said to the banks: Feel free to lend money to everyone who want to buy bitcoin even if they are unable to pay it back, we will have your back if it fails, but you will be able to make a profit from it you will keep it.
Then it would be comparable, but that is not the case.

The median dollar value per transaction in BTC is around 3,000 usd currently, the average is even higher at 70,000 usd.
The whitepaper said that the memory would not be a issue (not storage) because of mores law, and that fees would be the incentive for miners once block rewards got smaller without creating inflation.
When it comes to the vision of Satoshi you will find that people will claim that his vision is whatever they themselves want. The white paper only describes the implementation of a Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System where trust, permissions or identities is not needed. There is nothing in there about what he wants bitcoin to be.

People who use bitcoin to pay for things are selling bitcoin, but instead of selling for USD and using USD to buy something they just sell bitcoin for the thing directly.
There is one way to use bitcoin as a payment method, and that is to buy 10 USD of bitcoin and then use that amount right away.
People generally do not pay bitcoins, they use bitcoins as a way to transfer an USD amount using bitcoin as an intermediate.

Not miners but developers that volunteer their time.
Miners are for the most part people who use machines and electricity to make a profit.
The higher the demand of bitcoin, the higher the price, the more miners it will attract (or at least mining machines). The more miners there are, the less the profits per miner becomes.
The only miners that could be said to support bitcoin are those who will continue to mine even after it is not profitable or when there are other coins they could mine for a greater profit.

You may get lucky and have your transaction confirmed earlier if there is less demand and the price drops faster.

At least hope that it is actually used for something other than speculation.
It could function as a stable store of value for poor countries, or it could be a payment method for niche stores and online services, could also be a payment that people who have bitcoin use to each other.
But for it to be a currency that grows in price because there is more money in it alone is not good for anyone but those who benefit from entering and exiting it at the right times.
It may have been better if bitcoin did not take off this year but instead rolled out the LN and got enough availability without mega blocks to the point where it could actually become a viable payment method.
But that requires the crypto market as a whole to not increase 30x times in a year. And the time scales are on the very long term.
Rather have slow sustainable growth than extreme bursts of growth followed by years of loss in interest.

The max distance to the moon is around 406,000 KM.
A comment about the "Bitcoin most valuable currency in the world".
The US M2 money supply increases with around 6% before inflation and 4% after inflation is accounted for. If bitcoin will become the most valuable currency as the article mentions it would have to sustain a over 6% increase in price every year on average.
The current market cap for bitcoin is 0.3 trillion compared to the US dollar M2 13 trillion. If bitcoin grows 40 times it would be at par with the US dollar. Since the US dollar increase about 6% a year bitcoin would need to hit 1 million dollars in five years time to be at par with the dollar in terms of value.

Historically bitcoin has rose 100x in price in a year like 2013 and then dropped to a bottom of 10% of that in three months.

The S&amp;P money you held from 2008 would had an average annual growth rate of around 10% with a total ROI of 155%, which is the average historical growth for any longer period in SP500 or large stocks in general.
The only way you could get close to a 400% ROI today would be if you bought it all at the very lowest point a couple of months into 2009.
It is always advisable to invest extra after a crash, the only period where you see above average growth for years is the period after a crash (before the next), part of the reason ordinary people lose big is that they are not able to capitalize on making extra investments after a crash, but instead often sell when the price is at its lowest to cut their losses.
As a long term investor in crypto you will gain from bitcoin going down to 5k, it will give you the ability to put more money into it and have a higher average yearly return over time. Same with putting money into the crypto market as a whole, which has a lot of potential for growth.
The price bubble scenario is not the death of bitcoin or crypto, but a return to the average growth which could be 100%+ growth per year for many years. The crypto market cap increased 35x this year alone, from 17 billion to 600 billion. Even if the market drops 90% to 60 billion the coming weeks/months, it will still  have been a fantastic year for crypto, and we may see a 10 trillion crypto market in 5 years time.

A support level would be the point where people want to buy in even if there is a downward trend.
But this is a trend that develops over months or years, the 18k is just a couple of days old. If we see the price go to 25k and back to 18k, then to 22k and back to 18k it would start to look like a support level.
The last days the price has gone below 18k and over 19k and this is the first time we have seen this price level.

He is saying that the price of transaction is so high that he could not sell the bitcoin now even if he wanted to.
Transaction costs is measured in Satoshi (0.00000001 BTC) per Byte.
A transaction is a number of bytes long.
So a 200 byte transaction costing 300 satoshi per byte would cost 300sat times 200bytes, 60 000 satoshi, which is 0.0006 BTC.
But a transaction gets larger (more bytes) if the sender is using a wallet that has received a lot of bitcoin transactions in the past. Each previous received transaction could add around 180 bytes to the cost of sending it.
So if I have thirty inputs I may have to pay for over 5400 bytes to send it, at 200 satoshi per byte it would be 1080000 satoshi, around 0.01 BTC which would cost about 200 dollars. If I have 0.01 BTC in total in my wallet I would have to use it all to send it. In other words not being able to sell the bitcoin because the price of selling (sending) it is to high.
When there is a lot of unconfirmed transactions it is a sign that the satoshi cost per byte will be high to send bitcoin. When demand for transactions is high and the queue is long it cost more to get in the front of the line.
The satoshi cost goes down to 10-20 satoshi per byte from time to time when there is less demand for transactions (less unconfirmed transactions), at that time I would be able to send my 0.01 BTC and only pay 5-10% of it in transaction cost. That is what is meant that the (transaction) price is to high to sell.

An asset is anything that has economic value.
Tangible assets are things like a machines, land, your phone.
Patent and copyrights are examples of intangible assets, they have economic value even though they are not physical things.
The quicker the asset can be converted to cash, the more liquid it is, both the money in my bank and bitcoin has a high liquidity. My fidgetspinner collection is still an asset, even though I will take some time and work to actually convert it to cash.
Nobody own the bitcoin brand, and it is not possible to buy or sell it, but if it was, the brand itself would be an intangible asset.
When people GPU mine altcoins they use their assets (home, computer, gpu, money for electricity) to produce an asset in the form of some cryptocurrency that hopefully has more economic value than what they spent in equipment and electricity over time.

It is not the price of each coin that dictates the price per transaction but the demand for transactions in that currency compared to the supply of space in the block. You could say that the price is an indicator of the number of transactions that is wanted in the form of purchases and sales, but the important factor there is the change in price over time which drives speculation. People are not flocking to bitcoin because they want to be their own bank, they want to cash out with a nice profit.

It depends on your time horizons and if you believe that bitcoin is in an upwards trajectory still. It could rise back to 20k in the coming days, maybe even breaking 20k and rise towards 30k. But after such a rise I still think that the price will go down during 2018, at least towards 10k. Personal bet at 5k at the lowest of 2018.
So if you plan on keeping bitcoin forever and not sell if the price reaches 30k in some weeks, then I think there is a bigger chance of getting cheaper bitcoins than 14k in the coming years.

You can also insure yourself against identity theft. The insurance companies themselves are insured ultimately backed at the local, state and in the end the US government.
Crypto can be stolen from you by thieves that use force to make you reveal your private keys, and will still have reasons to not leave you as a witness. The law can take you freedom away even if you keep your crypto, while it may be impossible to confiscate the crypto itself, the goverment can confiscate anything you actually buy using crypto without having a declared income and documentation of taxes paid.
Having some crypto, just in case, is great, but do not put all your money into it.

Past performance is not indicative of future results. Absolutely.
I do not think the price will be 200k in the next year, I think it will fall to at least 5k during the year and I think it will be (most likely) around 10k at the end of the year.
This growth is not sustainable, and after every explosive growth of this scale, there is a period of decline. I am optimistic about crypto in the coming years and decades, but it will not be a smooth upwards climb, and whatever ends up being king of the hill in 20 years may not be any of the current top100.

There is no solution without a trade-off. It could be that the demand for bitcoin transactions goes down by having another crypto being adopted where Bitcoin becomes a store of value that is periodically converted to other currencies. That would make buying bitcoin like buying a non-voting stock that pay dividend in the form of hardforks than a currency.


There will be transactions from the blockchain to the LN and back form the LN to the blockchain. It would also be possible to send directly through the blockchain.


Back in the days when 100 satoshi per byte was closer to a cent there was a unwritten rule to not accept transactions that had fees that was too low. This was done to prevent spamming of free (or almost free) transactions to fill up the block for cheap.
The only reason a miner would not accept a transaction of 10 cents would be if there was not enough space to fit every transaction that paid more than 10 cents.

Scarce in the same sense that gold is scarce, you can buy a milligram of gold on paper for 0.7 usd or you could buy 0.000043 bitcoin, the tonnes of gold that is possible to mine and the amount of bitcoins are fixed.
The cost of transacting that bitcoin or the fees to sell that ownership of gold would be greater than the value of the thing itself, but it is still possible.
If the bitcoin is traded on an exchange and you pay no fixed transaction cost it would be possible to buy a Cent of bitcoin which would be around 0.000001 btc.
You could say that the smallest sensible amount of bitcoin that has a value is above the average transaction cost which is currently around 0.00035351 or 6 usd at current prices (will get lower if fewer transact per hour or the limit of transactions per hour is increased).


This is part of the reason why some are unhappy with Bitcoin Cash.
A new currency was created by a group that did not seem to be interested in preserving bitcoin, it gave everyone that held a bitcoin a new "bitcoin" (Bitcoin cash, not related) an was based on the same technology that bitcoin, it was promoted as the better Bitcoin in hopes of taking over, if it had been successful it would have absorbed most of the capital in Bitcoin.

If by making a child you mean sex.
I think you may have the cause and effect mixed up.
Gold has historically been a commodity that has held its price compared to the growth of the inflation as a whole in part because the amount of gold that can be mined is determined by the economy as a whole, technology and labor. Adjusted for Inflation gold cost about the same now that it did 200 years ago. It is a popular store of value partly because of this.
The upper bound of gold is set on the cost of mining more gold, as the price of mining increases that upper bond gets increased, but it is not a lower bound. When there is less demand for gold the mining operations slow down, when the demand goes up there is more mining.
The reason people mine gold is because the demand for gold has made it profitable to mine gold, it is not that the enormous cost of mining gold gives golds its value.
The true human valuation of gold will show itself once almost all the gold in the upper crust is mined. For now the enormous work around mining is not adding any value to the gold, it is just limiting the supply of gold being added to above ground markets.
When the last gold mine stops gold will not lose any value.

One project to make cheap transactions possible: 
When people buy and sell bitcoin on exchanges they are not actually transferring bitcoin back and forth, they are buying and selling tokens on the exchange that they later can transfer from the exchange to their personal wallet. Same with places like localbitcoin where it is free to send bitcoin from one account to another, but to move the bitcoin to a private wallet has a transaction fee.
There is currently no way to keep a full node on ordinary computers and have an large amount of transactions over time.
Since every transaction is stored in a block, and an transaction is around 200bytes there is only room for around 3-4 transactions per second on average at 1mb. Bitcoin has around 300k confirmed transactions per day.
You can see the average confirmed transactions per day here: 
Which works if Bitcoin is used as bank accounts and wire transfers do today.
50GB per year works out for most modern computers, but the 8mb block that Bitcoin Cash could easily create 400GB per year before it expands its blocksize limit again, which it has to do if it takes off.
The comparison that is often used is the daily transactions of Visa, which is somewhere above 1000 per second. It can handle over 50k per second. If bitcoin cash becomes gets close to 1000 transactions per second it would add terabytes to the blockchain every year, that could possibly limit the amount of full nodes to such a large number over time that it could weaken the security of the network as a whole.
The closer the cost of transactions goes towards zero, the higher the risk of transaction spam becomes, if the blocksize is large enough and the transaction fees are cheap enough, it will be filled by actors that wish to cause harm by adding to the blockchain size. An reason to try to increase the blockchain could be to reduce the number of full nodes to weaken the security.

In the US all cryptocurrencies are regulated as property and you disclose what you have, there are no specific lower or higher limits.
Any holdings you have in cryptos you report as your wealth.
When you sell/trade crypto you report the capital gain/loss and pay the taxes.
To follow the law you need to keep track of every purchase/sale/trade using any crypto and post every realized gain and loss. Every time you use a crypto you are realizing a capital gain or loss using FIFO or LIFO depending on your choice. That includes converting between cryptos and using crypto to buy goods or services.

The exclusion for gold-to-gold is the real change.
But it has never been the case that anything like trading currencies or property like stocks have been like kind.
Trading bitcoin for bitcoin would be the the closest comparision to trading gold bullion, like us exchanging 1BTC to each for the transaction history or whatever. You could never trade gold bullions for silver without realizing capital gains, even though they where property, just like you could not trade Doge for Bitcoin without realizing capital gains.
EDIT: it is **NOT** implied that Crypto is like-kind (by it being explicitly stated that it is not now), looking at the old criteria for like-kind it does not qualify under any circumstances. The fact that it is explicitly stated is because it is a widespread misconception.

It is an accurate representation of the profits at **today's** price and difficulty.
Over a year the difficulty rises by 4x give or take, unless the price increases at the same rate, you will earn less and less every month and you may not even break even.
That is the reason why you have to buy 1 year contracts, the profits per day goes down every day. It always feels like you are making bank, but it all depends on the price and difficulty.

Sure, but the idea is that it is nearly impossible to prove that someone did not get their money from a stranger who just gave it away. So why even bother trying to counteract money laundering?
It is the citizens responsibility to declare any income and demonstrate where they got the resources, the assumption is that if they do not do it, they have not earned it with legal means or paid taxes on it.
The only option is that nobody pays taxes and that all income is legal income even if it is gotten by committing crimes. We have a society that is built around some level of self governance, and part of that is documenting where we get the resources from.

If you feel guilt from earning money, you may consider donating a portion of it for something that you personally support.
You can not save people from making bad decisions, financial or otherwise, and only they and their support network will be able to take it.
That is the nature of freedom in general, freedom to make stupid choices included.
Most people that lived in periods of high interest are do not have fond memories of it, as everyone that is not wealthy (or old) have more (and higher) interest on debts than savings. Increase the savings interest and the debt interest will increase even more.
There are trade offs everywhere, high risk/reward, low risk/reward, higher efficiency lower equity, more time less money, more money less time, more freedom more responsibility, higher volume less quality, many medium skills or one large skill.
The underlying reason someone gets in a situation holding the bag is desperation from a situation that would be there Bitcoin or not, or plain greed and recklessness.

Why would you report your crypto in fbar?
Crypto is not like having money in a foreign bank account, it is classified as property, not part of fbar as far as I know.
Post the wealth you have in crypto no matter what it is, it does not hurt and you do not have to pay any taxes on it. You need to keep track of all your crypto trades anyways when you are realizing your capital gains. If there is a limit you will at some point cross it so it is easier to keep a record from the start.
You could contact an attorney for your jurisdiction and find if there is a lower limit for crypto when reporting your wealth.

Yes, the income is the market value of the bitcoin at the moment you mined it, but if the price increases before you sell it, that becomes capital gains when you do sell it.

If someone has been buying and selling bitcoin without documenting the cost basis and realized capital gains and losses in they may have been unaware of the law but it still applies.
The IRS notice 2014-21 laid out the rules and classification of bitcoin.
Before that point it was unclear if bitcoin was a currency or property and it was also unclear at what limit you had to report a payment to the IRS. The general rules for capital gain and loss always applied even though the tax rate was undecided up to 2014.

I may have had a different understanding of what playing around money means. The amount may not be as important compared to how a person relates towards gain and loss.
It is possible to put 1% of this years savings into something as volatile as Bitcoin and still be stressed out about the fluctuations, or put 90% of this years savings and be calm as a cucumber, it is all about the risk tolerance and overall situation of the person.
The most important factor is that it is rewarding to actually trade and that it is possible to lose the money and not lose sleep over it.

Your bitcoins today works more like an stock/property that signals confidence in the future of concurrency. It is classified as a property in US law.
The average return on large company stocks in the US is around 10% per year before inflation, about 7% after Inflation.
Fiat currency collects interest in the bank, but the interest is generally lower than the inflation.
The economical reason people buy and hold Bitcoin in countries that can invest in the stock market is that they imagine that bitcoin will last and outperform the other markets and give a higher average return.
The only reason to sell/use bitcoin is if you are out of fiat, are unable to buy it with fiat or have another investment/market that you have more faith in the longevity and growth in.
There is nothing wrong with buying and selling using Bitcoin as a currency, but if you are a US citizen you need to keep a record of every purchase and sale, and the conversion from USD to Bitcoin at the time of the transaction. Then you have to calculate the difference between the time you bought BTC and the time when you sold it for every transaction and post the gains and losses of value in your tax return.

What makes a crime a crime is nothing but the law saying it is so.
Money laundering is just a service, same with making fake IDs and passport, dental surgery to not match the records, selling fake alibi and fake testimony. You could even make the case that making and selling counterfeit money is just an honest service as long as the customer knows they are buying counterfeit money.
The only thing law enforcement can hope to do in most cases, is to capture and prosecute the actual criminals after the crime is done, but they will be much more effective at that if there is not a large, legal and thriving "Escape from law enforcement and undermine the courts" industry all around.

As you say, more eggs more baskets, mining is not the better way to buy bitcoin, just another way to buy it. The safest is to both buy with regular intervals and mine at the same time.
Someone that has a "Buy 100 usd bitcoin a month" budget could buy directly and buy mining contracts for 75/25 for example.
My point is that if you have a year long mining contract and you intend on continuing mining long term, you can reinvest the bitcoin into a new contract and buy a bitcoin directly from the market, its is for all intents and purposes the same, only a way to decrease the % that is invested in mining.
It also depends a bit on the laws in your country as well. Withdrawing bitcoin from a mining service can be classified as ordinary income and taxed as such, while reinvesting does not count. If that is the case you can postpone taxation until the day you quit mining for good and add up the contracts as the total cost, you may save some work and taxes that way.

The site sells 10 GH/s for 2 dollars for 2 years, that you can start to mine in 8 months.
The strange part is the guarantee that you will see 500% returns, or the contract will be extended until you do see 500% returns.
Even a lifetime contract is unlikely to even reach 500% at those prices and that point in the future.
The difficulty increased sixfold this year, and he claims to be introducing machinery that is six times more potent than the current, and that that the price of bitcoin does not have to rise.
At todays prices and difficulty it would take about three months to earn back the 2 dollars, then 18 months to get a 500% return. But the earning of 10GH/s will only decrease over time as the difficulty increases.
If the difficulty rating has a comparable incrase the next year you will not even make back your 2 dollars as 
At the current growth rate of doubling difficulty every 3 months you will see that it takes over 12 months to make back the 2 dollars, then after three months you have earned back 50 cents, but now it will take 18 months to earn back the rest. Three months later you make back 25 cents, but now the remaining time is over 2 years, then when you make back 12.5 cents the next three months you realize that you may earn back only 50% or so of the original investment, even if it runs forever.
The contract is still true, you get the contract until you get back 500%, the kicker is that it will run forever before you even make back your initial investment.
You can still make money buying HashPower on the site, only after it has launched and is forced to set the price at a competitive level.
It is better to pay for 1 dollar for 40 GH/s for the next year than to pay 1 dollar for 10 GH/s for the next hundred years, unless we have reached the peak energy/computing efficiency for hashing, which the owner says is not true even today.
The only scenario it could possibly pan out to a 500% return would be if the price of bitcoin itself increases more than 500%, at a rate faster than the difficulty increase, in which case you would be better off just buying bitcoin directly instead of mining it.
There is also a caveat that if the bitcoin price at some point drops to below 5.5k, you lose the guarantee of a continued contract beyond the two years.
This does not inspire much confidence.

Bitcoin / other crypto is not like-kind trade, it never was like-kind trade. There are plenty of people who have been arguing for why crypto is not like-kind, but they have always been dismissed.
The clarification of crypto / Bitcoin came already in 2014 with the IRS notice, it was pretty clear even then.
The new tax laws just makes this clear and shuts down any argumentation (that is wrong) that it is like-kind.

The Ideal Lightning Network would make it possible for anyone within the network to send to any other part of the network by routing trough different channels, and there would be little or no cost to keep a payment channel open once it was established. (Potentially you could earn small amounts of fees keeping channels open).
It would still be the on-chain transaction fee of setting up a payment channel, but once it is done it is possible to trade bitcoin from anywhere on the LN to anywhere on the LN.
So you could say that 4 million people can enter and leave the lightning network every month, but if the LN is functional there is no reason to actually leave it. Large amounts of bitcoin can be transferred into the LN in one go, for example an LN based ATM service, then there could be millions of transactions on that ATM service without it ever closing down the channels. Once the ATM runs out of BTC it could just transfer in a new large amount directly or purchase BTC from another LN vendor.
The effective blocksize would become the number of transactions in the LN on average per payment channel that is opened/closed. The more the LN is used, the higher that number becomes, there is no practical upper limit. Thousand of transactions per LN channel is functionally same as thousands of times larger blocks in the main blockchain. The BlockChain would then function more like the doorway in and out of the network where bitcoin is traded, which would be the LN.
But that is the ideal, it requires that it is possible to relay transactions through the network from anywhere to anywhere, that it is little/no cost keeping channels open and that they do not expire unless they are closed down manually. The only thing that will be preserved in the blockchain is the balance in the opening and closing of a channel, but each payment channel is a locally stored node that only the two people who opened it will have access to.

The general rule is that the more instability and uncertainty there is in the markets or countries, the more people will move towards storage of wealth that they view as secure and lasting.
When the banks in Cyprus confiscated money from peoples savings accounts in 2013 they turned to Bitcoin as a means to store their money. That was a huge factor in a large price increase. The price topped at 1k in november 2013 and then decreased 85% over a year and stayed around 200-300 between mid 2014 and mid 2016.
This current boom the last year has been in part because of large scale investments in Japan and South Korea. The news fuel interest and brings more demand from people who want to be part of it.
Bitcoin has gained legitimacy as an commodity in several countries and it will soon be possible to trade products that are related to bitcoins price on investment accounts.
The history of bitcoins price is not as interesting as daydreaming about the possibilities of the future.

Lets say you buy a year long contract for 1 dollar a day on average and the hash power increases 8 times over the year. If you start out with 100% extra profit per day compared buying bitcoin directly you get (dollar per bitcoin per day):
2 + 1,62 + 1,32 + 1,07 + 0,87 + 0,71 = 7.59
That is 1.265% over what you expected. And still a year to go.
Then the next six months:
0,57 + 0,47 + 0,38 + 0,31 + 0,25 + 0,21 = 2,19
Only 36.5% of what you would have gotten by buying directly.
All in all you make: 9,78 worth of bitcoin when you could just have bought 12.
The reason the youtuber make bank is that they are in the start of their contracts, to break even during a year with a stable price they need to have 50-100% profits per day to even break at the end of the year. So buying more hashpower looks good because today it is profitable, but on average over the year it will often not be, it is an gamble.
Overall it is not a ripoff, but the start of the contracts make the impression that it is more lucrative than buying bitcoin directly. It is a way to commit buying a little bitcoin every day for a year by paying up front.

There are only three options when it comes to transaction fees with bitcoin:
* Lower demand for transactions.
* Possibility to make transactions of the blockchain.
* Larger blocks.
Every choice has some sort of trade off. Centralizing the full node onto servers, setting the block size to unlimited and the minimum transaction fee to 1 Satoshi per X bytes would take bitcoin one step closer to currency. But it would centralize bitcoin fast unless there was an incentive for people to build servers to run the node at a loss.

The same goes for those who believe that the last year will any way be representative for the future growth of crypto in general.
In that the MarketCap for crypto grew from short of 18 Billion to closing in on 600 Billion.
A 33x increase in a year to a market cap of 0.6 trillion is not possible to keep going, another year of 33x growth will land make crypto market cap be 20 trillion comparable to the all the easily available money in the world at 35+ trillion.
The only way a similar year can occur is if we have a cryptowinter with 80% decrease in market cap and have another 2017 in four years.
If crypto is staying at this level and growing consistently we may see a 50-100% increase per year for some years before it is no longer the fastest growing segment of the global economy, the 3300% yearly increase we experienced is the last of its kind in crypto (barring a supercrash).

While that is true in general it is not true in the short term (weeks or months).
Even though the price have doubled the last month, the difficulty adjustment for November 10th and 24th both went down by 1% and 6% because the hashing power was used elsewhere (Bitcoin Cash, Bitmain, wink, wink). That is part of the reason why it has been exceptionally good returns lately on mining bitcoin.
But that is an exception to the norm.
Buying hashing power is another way of buying bitcoin daily for a year where you pay (Difficulty / Market Price), or you could say that you get paid (Market Price / Difficulty).
If bitcoin mining is on average more profitable than just buying it regularly for the same price you are better off reinvesting all the bitcoin you mine into more mining.
The problem still stands that hashflare the company can go bankrupt and reserves the right to change the terms of your agreement.
The life-long contracts that people bought in good faith was terminated and people had no recourse.
It is its own form of gambling on the difficulty/market price ratio. It can be fun, but it is not more secure than just buying at regular intervals.

To your first point, using bitcoin and selling bitcoin is the same thing. I should have specified. Any trade is a sale/purchase, using bitcoin to buy something is a trade.
To answer your last questions about the consequences of people being able to invest in and use bitcoin to pay for goods and services: there will be little or no change for the US goverment or society as a whole.
The US government actively encourages ordinary people to invest in assets long term by having a lower tax rate for long term investments and by giving tax deductions to mortgages. Everyone is free to open an investment account or put their money into any variety of stocks and funds and pay no taxes on it until the day they realize the capital gains. If they put their money into large stocks or and an S&amp;P500 passive index fund they can expect 7.5% yearly returns when factoring in inflation for the long term.
The government want the fiat currency to lose some of its purchasing power over time partly to encourage spending and investing in other asset classes. If there was deflation and usd appreciated compared to all other assets it would discourage spending and investing.
The government aims for around 2-3 percent inflation per year uses interest rates from the federal reserve to make it more expensive for banks to lend money, regulation on the reserve requirements in banks to force them to lend less and higher interests on their state bonds to remove money from the markets.
Bitcoin is an asset that you can trade with others over the internet without an intermediate, it is great for transactions between countries and perfect for developing countries. But it will not make any societal changes in the US or have any meaningful impact on the ordinary person.

Around November 11 Bitcoin Cash was doing really well, it rose from 5% to 15% total market share of the currencies over two days. But if you bought at that spike it would have been the worst timing possible as it Bitcoin Cash returned to 5-6% market cap not long after. But overall Bitcoin Cash has been around 5% of the total market share.

Reddit is so large and easy to join that people who wants to ask the internet a personal question about bitcoin ends up at r/bitcoin. In these lowly bitcoin times there will be a lot of people who have never had any interest in blockchain or investing asking the void: "Could you please share your crystal ball?" And there will be plenty of people who want to offer their brand of crystal balls, that is what is in demand. Any honest response that "We don't know" wont fly.

Even Andreas who was an extremely early adopter and advocate of bitcoin had to sell his bitcoin to pay his rent and debt in 2013, and I suspect the same is true for a number of people who had and wanted to have bitcoin.
If you felt strong emotions from the price rise/decline it was more than "playing around money" and your time horizon was not in the decades but days/weeks/months.
An fun experiment you can try if you have 100 dollars in GDAX is trying to lose money trading. You can try to buy at the highest spots and sell at the lowest and see how many days/trades (not counting fees) it takes you to half your investment.

There has been periods the last hours where even a 1000+ sat transaction was not included in the next block.
For bitcoin transactions in the 10s of thousands of dollars it currently makes sense to pay 1200+ sat/byte to get through in the next block if it is in a hurry.
That would be like us paying 12 sat/byte for a 100 dollar transaction.

Anything that has an market price and is possible to trade can function as a currency.
What is special about currency compared to other assets is that it can be tied to a country and units of it can be created by lending. The laws, import and exports, foreign demand for the currency, economic growth and monetary policies of a country all interact with the price of a currency and the price of the currency mainly affects the trade for that country.
The common goal of most modern countries is that the currency is stable and that the currency loses 2-3 percent of its buying power internally every year.
There is one thing that is the same with bitcoin and currencies, if there is high demand for a currency it will rise in price, but that is true for everything.
The main difference with bitcoin is that there is no country that has any control over bitcoin, and no country that uses bitcoin as their only currency.
This could change in the future, countries that have had their own currency fail sometimes switch to a foreign currency. If the market cap of bitcoin reaches a level comparable to the dollar or euro and have the same stability over time, a country in the future that had their own currency fail may chose to adopt bitcoin instead of another currency.
The problem is that the economy grows and if there is no way for the money supply to grow to stop the value of the currency from growing everyone will stop using the money for trade and just sit on it. As long as bitcoin is used and the economy grows it will increase in value over time. Even when it stabilizes it will grow in value compared to the other currencies at the rate that they expand their money supply, which has been a bit over 6% for the US over the last 16 years.

That is completely unrelated to the question of price bubbles.
Something can be an bubble even if the underlying asset that is speculated about is here to stay. A housing bubble is not a sudden realization that houses was not here to stay or that the housing market will not recover in the future.

A general answer to the mining/transaction questions.
The miners have little/no impact on the speed of transactions, because the system is designed to have 1 block every 10 minute. If less people mine it will adjust itself every 2 weeks to meet the 10 minute mark.
The transactions are limited by the space to store information which is the block, the thing that takes space is the transaction data. As long as there are more people that want to transact than there is space in the block it will have some cost. The more people want into the block, the higher the price they have to pay to get in the front of the line.


Then anything you have in your bank or wallet will be as useless as bitcoin.

This is a sort of self evident truth for whatever coin that is priced the highest. If Bitcoin Cash increased in price more than bitcoin it would gain the hashpower and become the most secure in terms of mining power needed for a hostile takeover. The only thing that could counteract it would be if Bitcoin had an fee percentage that was so large that the price difference was made up by by the fee difference, but that would need to reach lubricious levels (for miners), like 4000 sat/byte.

If you can not afford to put more than 5 dollars into bitcoin I would advice you to put that money somewhere else.

Just some copy/paste to confirm.
If you do not have any other income, you can sell the first 37k bitcoins without paying tax, then you pay 15% for the next 163k. In total you pay 12.22% tax 
You only pay taxes on realized capital gains, and you may be able to chose if you want to use FIFO or LIFO to figure out the cost basis that you use if you do not take it all out in one move.
If you have a million in bitcoin and you bought it for 200k you only pay around a total of around 100k in taxes total if you sell it all in 200k per year.
If you believe that bitcoin will crash you will be better off selling it all now and pay more taxes. Everything above 200k you pay 18.8% and everything above 418k you pay 23.8% on.

I absolutely agree that this is the only point we diverge.
The default setting for most full nodes are 72 hours, but as long as there are enough full nodes that have extended or removed the limit the transaction will be keep on being broadcast.

What almost nobody will tell you is that the cap of 21m can be increased, there is nothing that prohibits it or makes it impossible from a technical perspective. It would require the will of the people involved in bitcoin to change the code.
But everyone who have bitcoin and plan on selling it for a profit do not want that, the more bitcoin a group of people have, the more influence they have.
Newcomers love the idea of increasing the number of blocks, ie 2% every year, but if they get into crypto and get influence, they will be against the idea as it would hurt their personal bottom line and influence.
Like congress passing a bill that gives the people in congress much less power, technically possible, but unlikely.
From the very start bitcoins supply was based off gold, with a fixed supply that would be harder to mine over time as less supply was easily available. Just as gold there was a lot of regular people who joined the mining in the start, and now mining is large scale companies running thousands of machines in tandem.

The original poster said that he had traded altcoins this year.
Each trade between alt coins was a realization of capital gains.

~~If you are in the US and you have trade bitcoin actively the tax will be 25% plus an 3.8% NIIT surtax above 200k total income.~~
Every trade counts as realized capital gains.
If you convert BTC to USD in coinbase, that counts as a realization, same if you bought and sold BTC on exchange or traded it for other Crypto.
As for paying the taxes, that will happen after you file your tax return and get the owed amount, you report your realized capital gains in the tax report, and even then you will have some time to pay it after it is processed. If you describe your situation you may get an extension.

The problem is that there is only a relative small (in the thousands maybe low tens of thousands) of total nodes running. Compared to the million+ mining machines.
If nodes could do the voting you would see that there would be a lot of nodes coming online in virtual servers and casting votes.
The votes would be skewed towards lager block sizes as that would consolidate the voting power of those who already have a lot of nodes, making it harder for others to enter the voting market.

A rational investor takes their income, knowledge, tax laws, risk-tolerance, personality, debt, time-frame and goals into account.
Start of 2013 saw a 10x increase, then another 10x in the end of the same year.
Cost averaging from the start of 2014 to the end of 2016 was (in hindsight) better than buying in when the price dropped form 1000-600.
There are a few rules of thumb to anyone considering investing in anything:
* Do not invest money you cant afford to lose.
* Consult a financial planner/advisory
* Spread your investments in different markets.
* Invest a portion of your disposable income over time.
* Keep a record of all purchases and sales and pay our taxes.
* Do not take on debt to invest.
* Past Performance is Not Indicative of Future Results.

Best counterexample for the hype is the period from the end of 2013 to the middle of 2016.
Bitcoin reached all time highs in November 2013, a close to 100 fold increase form the start of the year. First from 13 usd to 100 usd, then from 100 usd to 1000 usd in the same year.
Then there was a long period of decline trough 2014, the price was between 200-300 in 2015, the price doubled in 2016 and then we crossed the 1000 usd threshold again in the beginning of this year.
Nobody knows if we are closing in on a situation close to what happened at the end of 2013. The current growth rates will not continue. Even if bitcoin continues and increases in value over time it could still easily return to 2-4k in price over the next year and we may not see a similar price to what is today in many years.

You can diversify into different coins, but the average return will on average be around the same as Bitcoin.
So if you buy 10 dollars in 50 coins you will see that some of them increase 10x+ while others decreases or grows little or nothing.
You could get lucky, but if you make 100x return on picking the right coin out of 200 alternatives you where just lucky, like you would be if you put money on green on a roulette table with beneficial odds.

There is fixed space in every block, around 2500 transactions per block.

If people wanted to sell Bitcoin but was not able to, that would just be a sign of market distortion.
You could argue that it worked in the favor of those who have Bitcoin, but it worked against those who wanted to buy Bitcoin and those who wanted to sell but had to wait until the price had dropped more than the point where they decided to do it.
The average Bitcoin transaction is in the thousands of dollars, and most trade happens in exchanges where bitcoin is not moved in the blockchain.

The easiest way to check this for yourself is to see the price history of coins at coinmarketcap through the last 6 months. The graph shows the price development for every coin compared to bitcoin. Altcoins perform worse than bitcoin across the board when bitcoin rises in price even when tracked from the start.
The general trend is that the more bitcoin rises the less the altcoin rises compared to bitcoin with the exception of Monero which seems to swing more in line with bitcoin for reasons I do not understand.

This is how it looks from the outside at least.
Stores accepting Bitcoin for smaller purchases is not an option before the lightning network. It may become possible again after the current large interest calms down a bit, but the more stores takes bitcoin the worse the fees will become out of necessity.
The other way to approach it would be the credit cards that you fill up with BTC that converts BTC to the local currency at the time you use the card until your balance is out. Bitcoin Cash has a tipping bot on reddit that some people (mostly on BTC) uses, it used to be similar bots for bitcoin and doge back in 2013-14.
Even 100% SegWit adoption would not itself make it possible for any large scale adoption. Until LN the best that can happen is that people gets interested in Bitcoin and are more open to using it once it becomes possible.

That is true, but if the price of Bitcoin decreases drastically, the hashrate for bitcoin will also be reduced as the profitability goes down.
But if you buy a futures contract and the price increases, you will be out of luck as the hash rate will increase so much that you will not be able to make any profit at a fixed price over the year.

A grace period would be very nice.
Worst case scenario for a person in a grace period is that they pay the owed taxed which will not be more than 15% of the total profits of the realized capital gains. Which could not be more than 15% of whatever bitcoin they hold today if they have not sold before and sell everything today.
The only type of person I could see this being a financial problem for would be someone that bought 100 bitcoin at a very low price, sold it when it had increased 100x and spent it all already.

Yes. The closing price of bitcoin 1. jan 2017 was around 998 usd.
If the price 1. jan 2018 is 1000 usd there has not been a a drop from the start of 2017 to the start of 2018.
For the people who bought in 1. jan 2015 at 320 dollars it has been a goo 46.2% annual return.
Only those who bought in the top of 2013 at 1151 usd would have had a long term loss if they sold at that price.
If someone bought at 20k and bitcoin hits 100k within 15 years they will still have made a standard good yearly return of 11%. If it happens within the next 10 years it would have been 17% per year.
Bitcoin may not be around in 10 years, and it might never reach 20k, but if it does survive, it unlikely that it will not an average give a good return over decades, even for those who only bought at each ATH.

Spamming low cost TXN will not make the price of transactions go up, the highest cost transactions gets prioritized no matter how many 0-10 sat transactions are spammed. Someone could spam the TXN, but it would still be in the back of the line.
If a group of people wanted to effectively make to artificially boost the transaction cost to a certain level they would have to spam the transaction cost that they wanted to maintain, ie spam 300 sat per byte, they could spam the lower transactions as well, but they would need to maintain the largest cost buffer to keep the price at that level.
For ever 100 satoshi that someone wants to artificially inflate the price, they would need to pay 1 bitcoin every block. Since there will always be someone willing to pay a certain fee the number would be something less than 1 bitcoin. If one or more miners do it to jack up the transaction costs they will hurt themselves as they will both pay a large portion of the cost and lose out on the profits from potential legit transactions.
But the reality is that any sufficiently wealthy group could pay a maximum of 144 bitcoin per day per 100 satoshi they want to have as the lower floor. At the current prices it would take 25 million dollars per day to put an effective 1000+ satoshi per byte transaction cap per day.

If Walmart accepts toothpicks will subtract the value of each toothpick.
Walmart will set the price of the goods to be equivalent of the amount they themselves could trade it in for now including the cost of the trade, this would necessarily be lower than the production cost of making toothpicks for the producers of toothpicks. It would become possible to buy tooth picks for dirt cheap directly from Walmart or from one of their customers that buy toothpicks from them. Today someone could arguably sell or gift a box of toothpicks and it would hold some value to the person getting it, but if it worked as a medium of payment it would be like selling or gifting a single cent.
Gold coins would not gain any value from being able to spend it on walmart even though it is a limited supply, the reason is that walmart will set a price that is higher than whatever you could sell it for directly for spot price + the fee as they have to to cover the cost of converting it and it would only make it easier to get rid of gold coins.

You would be better of increasing the block size than increasing the speed.
If the memory pool size reduced the difficulty it would incentive miners to spam the memorypool with low fee transactions until it was overflowing so that blocks got generated at maximum speed. To ever hope to clear the memorypool in that scenario, you would need blocks popping up so fast that the collective spam attacks would be unable to be registered in the nodes before they filled the blocks.
This is also the reason you will never see free transactions, or extremely cheap transactions like 0.1 cent per transaction, because bad faith actors would just fill up the blocks for cheap. And it is also the reason that even if bitcoin had 64mb blocks, the blocks will remain full as long as there are people or groups that are interested in keeping them full unless enough miners set a minimum fee that is required to even be included in the block.

If you are withdrawing your earnings as soon as they are available you are not actually believing that cloud mining is worth it or safe.
Withdrawing 1.5$ of bitcoin is like selling 1.5$ worth of Hashflare or deciding against buying 1.5$ of Hashflare, in every case it is a vote against Hashflare in favor of buying bitcoin directly. If you have the option of withdrawing 1.5$ of BTC, you will also have the option to reinvest that bitcoin for more hash.
As long as buying Hash for a year is a safer bet than buying bitcoin now you will be better of reinvesting the bitcoin into more hashpower than actually withdrawing it. It feels different psychologically, but in reality it is the same. You can argue that buying Hashflare is better than buying directly and reinvest the BTC you mine in it, or you can say it is a worse choice and withdraw the mined amount.
If there are though times ahead for Bitcoin as you say, then it will be equally though for cloud hash mining, you get paid every day at that days rate, if bitcoin halves so does the payout. The fees are measured in the fiat cost of running the farm, lower bitcoin price means that the BTC fee percentage increases to cover the operational costs.
If Hashflare does not get hacked or mismanaged it actually bodes well for them, they are the only part that has a safe and stable position, they are guaranteed a modest profit for every contract as long as the cost of running the company, electricity and hardware depreciation is less than 100% of the bitcoin mined they will stay afloat.

The arguments of Milton Friedman and Thomas Sowell resonates strongly with my spirit and I think that Hayek was right.
I will also make the case for civil disobedience when laws are unjust and it is done with a specific purpose and without violence or personal gain.
But there is no option to make exceptions for bitcoin or any other asset or currency. Currently we pay taxes on capital gains for all property and currency, we might be better of if taxation came from other sources and was more limited. But as long as people hold the view that the wealthy live of their capital gains and ordinary people live of their wages there will be a political push towards taxation of capital gains.
Government in general have a tendency to grow and the more dependent people are on governmental services the more they vote for increasing the reach and size of government. It is a fundamental shift in how people see human nature and the role of government.

For someone who cares about bitcoin the price does not matter all that much, it is the concept and execution of bitcoin that gives most of the value, not how much it contributes to the retirement account.

I think his argument is about what is needed to protect Bitcoin.
Like military deterrence in a country with zero interest in conquest.
For Bitcoin to survive and remain decentralized there needs to be protection against outside hostile forces and saboteurs from the inside, just from a game-theoretical perspective. A centralized force that aims to centralize bitcoin for their own purposes could do it, unless there is sufficient efforts to keep that from happening, and that effort is most efficient if it has some centralization in it.
Centralized efforts can keep bitcoin decentralized.
Even the code that Bitcoin is based on is just one political consensus move from being changed. There is no magical 21 million coin barrier that can't be changed, nor any world agency that prevents market manipulation, systematic misinformation or mining centralization.
If you and I am able to focus on and discuss the technical aspects of Bitcoin, that would only be because there are groups that work to maintain and protect bitcoin from subversive forces so that we do not need to.

Bubble means that the price of something does not match the true demand of the underlying asset.
There are two sorts of people that buy and hold Bitcoin, those who understand it and wants to be in the long run and those who thinks that the price will keep on rising at a high rate that will bail once the price stops rising or starts to decline.
Anything that rises in price quickly could potentially become a bubble as long as those who put money into it does it primarily because they believe that the price will increase forever at a higher rate than the alternative investments. If it is not an bubble the price will level off at some point and have a growth comparable to the economy as the whole.
If it is in a bubble it will decline in value relatively fast, for example 80% of its highest price over months and years. It may grow on average over time, but at this current point too much of the money in it may be extracted to quickly for it to keep its price level stable or in a slow decline.
A price bubble is different than a total failure, bitcoin can stay at 10-20k for ten years and suddenly crash towards zero if there is a successful hostile takeover or an impossible to correct security flaw is found that compromises the whole network. But then bitcoin was not in a bubble, it just failed.

If only there was a way to Hard-Fork gold.
Then we could create gold cash, gold gold, gold diamond.
We could even create copycat gold with exactly the same quality and quantity of gold from scratch where the creators could keep some percent of the gold.
Or Zgold where you have no way of verifying the amount of gold, you have to thrust the creators that the number is right.
If over half of the gold miners in the world decided to mine gold with the goal to stop the already mined gold from being traded they would be able to for as long as they was willing to pay the cost of the mining.
Joking aside, there is no fixed cryptocurrency supply outside of the protocol of any given crypto and no natural price for any given crypto or the market as a whole outside the aggregate supply and demand.

The higher the optimism in a market, the more likely a crash is, because the optimism is founded on the recent historical trend of unsustainable growth. Which is why you can take the level of wide spread enthusiasm and hope among people as an indicator of coming downturns.
The best time to invest in an established market is when the confidence and optimism in that market is its lowest ever, which is usually around when the price level is at its lowest that it will be.
This is why ordinary people who try their luck at investing lose money when they try to trade actively. They come in when in the end of an enthusiasm phase, thinking that the current trend will continue, then when the trend reverses and they start to lose money they bail before the trends inevitably reverses once again to new heights.

There are a couple of reasons why people are stoked about the price increase of bitcoin.
* Money in bitcoin can be taken as a vote of confidence.
* People that hold bitcoin make money from it.
* Bitcoin is the indicator of the potential market for other cryptos.
* Bitcoin/crypto will only stop growing at high rates if they either reach full global saturation, or they die off/get replaced with something else.
If and when bitcoin or whatever else hits that global market saturation, some believe that it (or some variant of it) will fulfill the role of global internet money. So that anyone can pay anyone for any reason anywhere in the world without it having to be approved by anyone.

The belief that the price would go down.
The price will go down if enough people believe it will go down.
Because people sell when they think the price will go down, and in large enough numbers, that actually moves the price down.
So you could say that when enough people believe that other people believe that the price will go down, it makes them sell, which makes the price go down.
It is the same reason that the price of bitcoin skyrocketed in November, a lot of people thought that the price would go up, so they bought, which helped drive the price up.
It depends on the time perspective as well, bitcoin can be down this hour, but up this day, but down this week, but up this month.

No, because there will always bee transaction fees and miners get that.
The amount of bitcoins per blocks will keep halving until transaction fees will be the majority of the reward.
What decides the amount of miners is not the amount of coins in a block but (Price X Amount), so even if there is half the blocks, if the price is more than twice as high per coin it will still drive up demand for mining.
Only when bitcoin reaches its cap and its price stabilizes will we see anything like a fixed mining supply over time.

Andreas have dedicated and volunteered an large amount of time and energy to communicate/explain bitcoin and blockchain to the world because he believes in it and want to help it succeed.
Roger Ver is a long time advocate of bitcoin as well and both he and Andreas used to be the outwards face of bitcoin.
You may be aware of the Bitcoin Cash / Bitcoin situation.
The main reason a large part of people are not so fond of Roger Ver (outside of bitcoin cash) is based on how he conducts himself, especially to those who he disagrees with or that he feels do not respect him or his projects.
The most recent example is Roger Ver gloating over the fact that he has more money than Andreas because of his Bitcoin investments, when Andreas had to sell his bitcoins in 2013 for personal finance reasons.

* "Is there any other difference?"
* "Not really, it has increased in price, really really fast."
* "Why did you sell your bitcoin to buy a car if bitcoin increases in price all the time, why did you not take up a loan and make payments on it using your income instead of selling your bitcoin? Would that not be an admission that you believe that the interest of the loan would be greater than the growth of bitcoin?"

Because we have had a 20x price increase in a year, historically bitcoin has declined in price after larger increases in the past, not all at once, some percentage on average every day over weeks and months. Then when it has hit is bottom it starts its new gradual year long increase until a new period of extreme price increase starts.
I think that 75% of the all time high a year after the original price is a good estimate. Which would mean that the price had an yearly increase of over 100% from 2015-16-17-18, which is extremely good news in terms of growth.
I think we have maxed out the price for this time, and there will be a gradual decline to a new floor which will be there for some years, then there will be a new happening in a couple of years unless bitcoin gets out competed.

I am a huge supporter of Cryto, heard about bitcoin in 2009 but it was the Planet Money podcast the summer 2011 which made me understand the potential of it. 
The way I look at it: Bitcoin did not fall from 17k to 5k, it rose form 1k to 5k from the end of 2016 to the end of 2018.
The price in the end of 2020 (I think) not unlikely to be 100k or more, I just think that the price increases will come in large spikes followed by year long periods of lower prices between. Like the spike in 2013 followed by a decline in 2014 and then a rise from the start of 2015 that has continued on to this day.
I advice people against having short term investments in bitcoin even if the price rises over time, because I believe the price will spike and drop in the short term and that unless you can comfortably hold bitcoin for years/decades you may miss out on the next spike or when it actually reaches full maturation/saturation/a stable long term price with modest but consistent yearly growth.

1256 bytes is a large transaction.
143 satoshi is a low fee now, it is expected to take days.
So you have a large transaction with a relatively low satoshi per byte.
The reason the transaction is large is because the wallet you sent it from had many transactions coming into and those incoming transactions are listed in the transaction you made.
Large transaction costs is an unfortunate reality currently.

With money to fall back on I just invest my salary every month and live on my savings. But instead of making my boss update my investment portfolio every month I make my online bank transfer the money automatically to my investment account and make my investment account invest in my portfolio.

You need to document all trades you made.
The time and amount you traded for every trade, even converting coins on shapeshift.
Every time you exchange any crypto for anything else you have realized a capital gain (or loss).
If you hold bitcoin for over a year without trading it, then it is a long term investment which is taxed lower than if you trade it before one year has passed.

The practice of sponsoring small fees or offering products at a loss is not uncommon for exchanges and trading platforms. They know that if they can get people to dip their toes in a platform and have a positive experience, they will eventually stay almost no matter what happens down the road.
Make someone trade 10 dolllars of bitcoin back and forth up to 15 dollars and give them the ability to withdraw it, no fees attached. It buys a lot of goodwill and opens the floodgates for the person to pour money into the platform over the long run.
You can see yourself the amount of people accusing legitimate Bitcoin related services for ripping them off by taking a 10 dollar fee for them to send bitcoin. Only paying a fraction of the fee is not an option either as it raises the question of why they do pay for the whole amount if they can pay for a portion of it.
The metric that GDAX uses is probably along the line of the proportion of legitimate trades per free withdraw. If a large percentage of people start using GDAX as their wallet to make small purchases they will eventually give users the choice of a minimum amount for free or paying the fee for a smaller amount.

But before that time we will see blocks halving many times, it will take a long while before there will be no reward. What will happen gradually is that the transaction costs will be a large portion of the reward.

Set it and forget it.
Do not invest such a large amount in one asset that you get nervous when the price dips.
If you for example believe that bitcoin is on an overall upward trajectory you don't sell even when the price drops 10%+ in a day.
If you believe that bitcoin is on an overall downward trajectory it makes sense for you to sell even if the price increases 10%+ a day.
If you let the daily changes dictate how you buy and sell to maximize your profits you will most likely end up losing a lot by selling after the price drops a bit and buying when the price rises a bit rinse and repeat.

I think the price reduction towards 250-500 usd from 1000 usd would have happened even without the MtGox catastrophe. It would have been slower but it would still happen.
There was a short period in the end of 2013 where the valuation of bitcoin was to high. The fall in price may have dropped to 500 and stayed there instead of having a period in the middle of 2015 where it stayed around 250, we might have had a rise in price similar to today in 2016 instead of 2017 depending. But I do not believe that the average yearly price growth of bitcoin from when it hit 100 dollars in the middle of 2013 can sustain an average growth rate that is over 200% every year until market saturation. I think 100% is more likely and that the percentage will decrease over time. So that the ATH of 2017 would be about 16 times larger than the ATH of 2013 and the next all time high will at most be around 100k no earlier than the end of 2020.
Bitcoin may stay at 20k and have a 50% yearly increase to the end of 2021 where it will hit 100k.
But I think it will be more likely that it goes back to 10k (may dip as low as 5k at some point) in 2018, stays around 10k for 2019, increasing in 2020 and then hitting a new all time high in the end of 2021 that will break 100k.
TLDR: I think we will see an average growth of close to 100% the next four years, but it will look more like 2013-2017 than a steady climb.

That is a common example of a transaction fee.
Sending a byte costs a number of satoshi per byte.

A common transaction is about 200 bytes and each byte costs about 200 satoshi. Around 40000 satoshi give or take.
Around 0.00040000 BTC.
It can be lower if you have a wallet that lets you set the transaction price yourself, but the lower the fee on average the longer the transaction will take.

That is not a trade from bitcoin to something else, that is a transfer from yourself to yourself in bitcoin.
You spend bitcoin in transaction fees but they are considered a cost not a gain.
* Buy 1 bitcoin for 1k usd.
* Transfer it between your own wallets/coinbase and pay a total of 0.4 bitcoins in transfer fees.
* The price of bitcoin doubles and you sell/trade your 0.6 bitcoin for 1.2k total at 2k per coin.
You bought bitcoin at 1k and sold it at 2k, but since the transfer is considered a cost you only pay taxes on the 0.2k more you sold it for than you bought it for even though the sale price would have been 1k if you did not incur the transaction fees.
That is part of why it is good to keep track of all transactions and the price you buy and sell bitcoin, then you only pay taxes on what you actually earn from bitcoin.

This is a new issue, but it has little/nothing to do with computing power.
It is a limitation in the amount of transactions that are possible to send, each block can only take so many transactions, so when there are more people sending than there is space in the block the price to get in goes up as the demand goes up.

If he keeps his word.
Send him 1 bitcoin
He will sell the bitcoin.
Then he will buy the bitcoin back at a higher price and return you for example 0.9 bitcoin.
Or he will buy it lower, take 10% for himself then send you back the rest. So if the bitcoin price drop 5% he will return you 0.95 bitcoin.
And that is if he keeps his word.

You do not have a clear understanding of what a pyramid is.
Bitcoin is just like any other commodity, only its supply is fixed.
You could make the argument that it is currently overvalued or in a price bubble, but the question for a person who wants to speculate in bitcoin would be if the price will rise or fall in the near future, not if it will crash in the far future.
There is nobody on the top of the pyramid so to speak, if you buy bitcoin today and the demand increase, you will benefit just as much in percentage terms as the guy who bought the first bitcoin - and if the demand decreases you will lose as many percentage points as everyone else.

You will only ever make a portion of what you invest over years when it comes to mining.
If you buy a machine for 1000 dollars it will take some time to earn it back, six months or more than a year depending.
Then you will make less and less every month after that as other miners come online and over the years as more cost efficient and energy efficient miners come on the market.
At some point depending on your electricity cost and the quality of the machine you may have to scrap it and buy another machine to continue making a profit, and even then it is not guaranteed.
If your motivation for mining is making money, you will on average be better off by just buying bitcoin or renting mining online.

Partly because people who are unfamiliar with bitcoin takes analogies from physical currency.
It could easily be that you could only sell bitcoin cents, maybe bitcoin takes 2% in transaction fees no matter how large the amount is.
They also do not know if you get a 500usd bitcoin and when the price doubles you get another 500usd bitcoin.
The hard fork means that a person could buy 1 bitcoin and then get another coin for free, and there seems to be a cheaper bitcoin called cash, maybe they are like paper bills and coins, worth the same only in different sizes. Maybe one is like a bank account and the other is printed on paper money. Hard to know as a newbie.

Bitcoins one true value is this: It is perceived to be secure and lasting and scarce, it is possible to trade bitcoin privately or through exchanges.
This can change over time if:
* there is a fatal security flaw.
* there is loss of interest over time, more want to sell than buy over time.
* trading even at larger volumes and longer wait times becomes unreliable or to costly it loses value.
If another thing that bitcoins comes that is perceived more reliable, more secure, builds more interest it will absorb the market share of bitcoin.
Bitcoin is for the most part a store of value.

You are right.
This is how I understand it, correct me if I am wrong.
If you earned no other income and realize a long term capital gains total capital gains of 50k that counts towards your income and you pay a 15% capital gains tax on everything above the 15% tax bracket.
15% taxes on 12349 in capital gain of the total 50k (50 000 - 37 651) and a total of 1852 (12349*0.15) in tax.
If someone purely lives of realizing long term capital gains on bitcoin they could realize 37 651 dollars ever year tax free.
The gap between your income and the end of the 15% bracket is what you can realize of long term capital gains without paying any taxes.

You can double your satoshi and still not pay any tax, it is the market price in dollars that count.
The amount you are taxed is based on the dollar price you started with, what you paid for your initial Bitcoin, the costs basis.
If bitcoin increases in price while you trade it, you pay an tax on the total increase over the whole year, even if you get more or less satoshi.
So if you buy 1BTC for 100 dollars, then you trade it back and forth, in the end you have 2BTC, but the price per bitcoin is only 50 dollars, so if you sold it you would only have 100 dollars, then you have gained 1BTC but you will pay not taxes.
Same the other way around.
If you actively trade 1BTC you bought for 100 dollars, but you are a terrible trader so you end up with 0.5BTC the end of the year, if that price of that 0.5BTC has increased over the year to be worth 200 dollars, you still have to pay taxes on the 100 dollar gain, even if you now have less bitcoin.
The only way to not pay taxes on the gains this years is not trade at all, just buy a crypto and hold it for years, then when you finally sell it or trade it, that will be the time you pay the taxes.

The arguments about people buying Bitcoin to get away from their inflationary currencies looks more like a Giffen good than a Veblen good.
People who feel they can not afford to hold their currency/property because it is to expensive (inflation/corruption/confiscation) in developing nations buy bitcoin to store their value, which makes the price increase. The increase in price makes it so it becomes more and more expensive to sell bitcoin compared to keeping it, which drives up the demand and price more even though the people may not even have any interest in bitcoin itself or its potential return on investment.
But for developed nations that want to flaunt their wealth using bitcoin it most certainly could be that the high price drives demand which drives the price. But that depends on bitcoin being viewed as something that has a certain quality of status and class.

The cryptocurrency market capitalization is 400 billion currently.
In 10 years it might be 1 trillion it may be 20 trillion.
Even from the peak in 2013 to now the bitcoin has doubled in value every year on average even if it was two years with stagnation between then and now. Bitcoin might keep on doubling on average until the potential for growth levels of at X trillion and it grows comparable to other asset classes.

The first time bitcoin got a liquidity close to what we have today was in 2013, it would take until 2016 for it to reach the same price as it had at the peak then and now we have seen a further 20x increase in a year.
Three months after 2013 the price hit bottom at around 10% of the ATH. But that was after two consecutive 10x increases in the same year. So you could say that there was a 10x increase from the start of 2013 to the lowest point in 2014 and that we have had a doubling of the price since then until the end of 2016.
The 20x runup in 2017 was more gradual than the two sudden increases in 2013. I think that the decline will be slower as well. It would be more accurate of me to say that I believe that the ATL of 2018 will be 5k, but that I believe this will happen in the end of 2018 and that after that it will stay and rise over time.
It may be 5k in the summer and rise to 10k in the end of the year. I think it is more likely that bitcoin will be 10k +/- 5k in the end of 2018 than it will be 25 +/- 5k.

@_date: 2017-12-23 08:38:06
Every block needs to be stored in the blockchain forever, so 1mb blocks ever 10 minutes means that the blockchain grows about 144mb per day.
Regular people can run the whole blockchain on their computers, taking about 150GB currently, partly because the block size is so small.
Increasing the block size will reduce the fees, but by how much in the short term, and how much in the long term?
Lets say there is 1000 people per block per MB in the block.
There are 1000 people currently every 10 minutes that are willing to pay 50 or more dollars to make a transaction.
There are even mre that are willing to pay 25 dollars, and even more that is willing to pay 10 dollars, all the way down to 1 cent transactions.
If there is only about 1900 people in total in the world that want to transaction bitcoin on average per block, increasing the blocksize to 2mb would fix the problem of high fees temporarily. But the extremely low fees would attract more people that would use it, and the block would be full again. The fees would then start to rise again until it was so high that a large percentage of smaller transactions gets to expensive to send.
It may be that doubling the size in the block only reduces the average fees paid by 10%, so that 16mb blocks that are filled still only reduces the average fees in total by 35% on average.
Bitcoin Cash is making the bet that increasing the block size 2x will decrease the fees paid by more than 2x.

That depends on what you mine and the difficulty adjustment.
Also comes down to the development of price overall.
It is impossible to tell.
But you can check the profitability of mining here:
As you can see it has gone up recently, but when the profitability goes up, the amount of miners increase, which causes the profitability to go down.
With the current price and difficulty, zero energy costs, you would make back a 2k (14TeraHash) mining machine in about 71 days.

If you bought 1usd worth of bitcoin in july and traded actively you would have 20 usd of bitcoin if you where lucky, not 10k.
The probability of having an 10 000x increase in your holdins over six months by active trading is less likely than winning the lottery.
The way some people trade and start with 10 dollars in their bank and end up with 10k during the year is that they take an high interest loan, trade the bitcoin during a sharp rise, sell the bitcoin and pay their debt. That is extremely risky and could easily make you a debt slave.
Some do margin trading where they only put up a percentage of their money in buy orders but this can easily result in losing more money than you have and ending up in major debt.

But it is symmetrical, so you will only ever pay the total amount you have gained, if you win 10k and lose 10k in two trades, you pay as much in tax as you get back in tax.

You could ask your tax agency or contact a tax attorney in your country.
It is good to keep a record of all transactions anyways.

In the country I live in ~30% of all the losses from a bitcoin is covered by tax deduction as long as I document the wealth and realized loss in the tax returns.
But for those who hide their bitcoins or don't document their purchases from the state it is possible to go towards 0.
@_date: 2017-12-26 08:52:42
Yes, that is a possibility.

A leveraged position means that the gains and losses are multiplied by a factor like for example 5 because there is borrowed money involved.
If the price drops 20% he is bust, if it drops 25% he is in the red.
Some contracts gets cancelled automatically whenever it goes to 0.
With a leveraged position you can not just hold forever, interest has to be paid on the part that is borrowed and there are time limits.
Just hodling is not an option. It is getting out now or staying and hoping for a quick turnaround.

Absolutely true.
Where I live Credit/Debit cards are free to use, 0 fees, no monthly cost, no % fee, instant confirmation, every store and online marketplace takes it. And there is no reason to think about taxation or currency fluctuations.
The appeal of Bitcoin and other crypto is the ability to send money to you or anyone else, right now, at a low cost, without we having to know who the other person is.
That was what made me excited in 2010s.
Buying bitcoin to sell it later for a profit is about as exciting as buying non-voting shares in a small company that takes off in the future.

There are a lot of people who "Wish that the bitcoin was cheaper again so they could buy it on sale" but they are generally not interested in bear market that lasts years, they just want to get some bonus gains on the way up to the metaphorical moon.
30 years of 15-20% relatively stable compounded growth per year will attract more long time investors into bitcoin than large spikes followed by years of stagnation and decline even when it reaches the same price in the end of the period.

People conflate complete destruction with bubble.
Which makes sense when you see the image of a bubble as something that blows up. So whenever the discussion of bubbles comes up the arguments are not about a temporary inflated price but the underlying tech and long term possibilities.

Not likely, no matter how small the transaction cost, as long as bitcoin rises in price over time there is no incentive to ever sell it/ spend it before absolutely necessary to cover debt or rent or whatever.

People use ounces to denote their gold holdings even if it is a store of value because it has a relatively stable value over time. Gold is in a sense a better indicator of value than fiat currency since the valuation of gold tends to grow at a rate at par with inflation.
The same could happen with bitcoin if it at some point increases at the same pace as gold for decades, or at par with inflation so that you would get the same amount of bitcoin adjusted for inflation over time.
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:41:29
The fees has always been under 1 dollar until very recently.
The reason it is so high currently is because of very high demand, when the demand dies down, the transaction costs will lower as well.

Don't do it unless you have a storage place for the machinery and it makes sense to hire someone to do maintenance, and do not bank on breaking even.

There is one way to reduce the cost and time for transactions, a giant price crash down to bitcoins in the hundreds of dollars. Then only those who wanted to actually trade with others online would use bitcoin and the demand would fall enough for the transaction cost to go down.

Monetary policies that restrict the amount of currency in circulation.
The fed can increase its lending rate to the banks which means that loans for consumers becomes more expensive/higher interest.
The banks can be required to hold a larger fraction of their currency in their vaults compared to what they lend.
The government can buy money by offering higher interest on state bonds that remove currency from the market.
There are other things that have been tried in the past such as wage/price control but that will always fail and cause large negative effects on the economy/society.

I have a hard time believing a girl saying "I've been sucked into this vortex" when begging for cash.
Girls generally will not use phrases that indirectly involve moisture or anything that has to do with being restrained, isolated or them being the passive recipient of surrounding circumstances to express their enthusiasms.
There is always exceptions, but being sucked into a vortex that is one of the most nerdy dudebro ways to phrase that something is interesting to you.

It might be the case that the price of bitcoin goes down towards 1k, but that in itself is not a bad thing. A stable price and moderate traffic will make bitcoin possible to use for those who are interested in it.
Any monolith crypto will be out competed in smaller markets by alternatives. That is the nature of crypto in general, you cant monopolize it.

You can create a coinbase account.
Verify your ID.
Transfer your bitcoin to them.
Then pay a percent fee to sell the bitcoin and a fee to transfer it to your bank, which can take some time.
Other than that it may be possible to sell bitcoin to the friend (if he is good for it and interested) at today's price.
Or your could create a contract with him that you will sell the bitcoin in a year and your friend will get paid the difference if the price goes down from today and you will pay him the difference if the price goes up.

The time between each block is the same.
The transaction fee is decided by the supply (the bytes of storage in the block) and the demand (how many wants to transact at any given point).
Bitcoin Cash has larger blocks (8mb) and currently free space in their blocks, so they are cheaper.
Bitcoin is filled to the brim currently so people have to pay extra.
But if Bitcoin Cash becomes popular they will fill up their 8mb blocks and the transaction fees will increase unless they continue to expand the blocks.
Bitcoin aims at making it possible to make transactions outside of the main blockchain, while bitcoin cash aims to keep all transactions inside the blockchain.
Having all transactions in the blockchain will make it grow, if it gets to large the majority of the nodes can be controlled by a few people, that could lead to the security of the network being compromised.

Bitcoin was around 400 dollars in 2014.
Even at that time you would have mined bitcoin at a profit for 1 million dollar within the year after covering the cost of miners and electricity.

There is no way.

Good that you dad did not lend you money for bitcoin.
If you lost the money it would create tensions.
If  it was a sizable amount and the money increased 25x it could create a split between you.

There are calculators like this one:
If you buy a fixed hash rate for a year it will gradually mine less and less bitcoins as the difficulty gets adjusted upwards. The more people that mine bitcoin, the less every miner gets.
You could expect the total amount of bitcoin you mine per fixed hash rate to decrease by around 75% every year. 
Which means that you have enough hash power to mine one coin in one year today you will only ever mine 0.75 bitcoins even if you keep it running forever if difficulty increases by four times every year.
Nobody knows if you will be better off by buying 52 dollars of cloud mining, buying 52 dollars worth of bitcoin today or if you spend a dollar worth of bitcoin every week for a year.
You have no guarantee that the mining company does not go under and take the bitcoin with them. Online mining is just another way of buying bitcoin over time, do it if you think it is fun.

There is an expression for this in investing:
"Bulls eat, Bears eat, Pigs get slaughtered"
Or less metaphorical:
"Bulls Make Money, Bears Make Money, Pigs Get Slaughtered"
It is possible to make money on an overall upwards trend, and on an overall downwards trend, but if the daily/weekly price fluctuations makes a person buy and sell in the hope of beating the market based on their emotions they will on average lose no matter if it is a bull market (upwards trend) or bear market (downwards trend).

I agree with you that I think that what he does should be legal.
I would make the argument that even if the business itself is immoral, it is still better than the alternatives, which are far more predatory and in the black market.
The best case scenario for get-ritch-quick people are that they lose some of their time and some of their money before they get disillusioned. Which is how I view his business from the outside.

If you have memorized your seed you can travel with an completely empty Trezor and reset it once you arrive.
Trezor also have the ability to have a number of hidden wallets using any number of passphrases. So if you are forced to reveal the pin they will only see the non-passphrase wallet.
EDIT: Since Bitcoin is classified as property in the US it would be a bit like being denied entry because you have stocks, money in your bank account or ownership of gold.

The question is not if the market cap will increase, but how much it will increased compared to other sectors and the market as a whole and how much volatility it has.
Since crypto is so volatile it needs a higher average ATH growth to justify the risk, unless it can on average grow faster than other sectors with growth potential it is now wise to invest more than a portion in it.
If crypto grows to 5 Trillion (adjusted for inflation) in 20 years it will probably not have been the best sector for long term investments.
Even if crypto has the best growth of all sectors the next 20 years it will be good to only have a certain percentage of the portfolio in crypto at any time.

Whenever resources are divided up between people it returns to the previous distribution.
The people who can't afford to keep their equal share of the coin will sell it to someone that can afford to keep it.
Those who value the coin will buy it, those who do not value it will sell it.
There will be a price equilibrium and the largest players will be able to influence the price with market manipulation.
Whatever distribution you see in coins where you have to buy in will naturally occur in the "one-person-one-coin" coin over time as the same underlying mechanisms play out.

That was the origin, but it is not how it is currently understood. The guy that bought Pizza for 10 000 Bitcoin did not HODL. Better to spend your dollars than your Bitcoin if you have both. Or at least buy Bitcoin and then spend some of it instead of spending Bitcoin without buying more.

Computation is the hashpower.
The hashpower is a measure of the amount of machinery that mines bitcoin.
There are two reasons why hashpower would be reduced, the price of bitcoin gets so low that the cost of electricity is higher than the benefit from mining, or the price of another coin like Bitcoin Cash rises so that more hashpower goes to that coin.
As more machines, and more power effective machines are produced and put to work, the hash rate increases.

In common usage HODL is not interchangeable or the same as spending.
It is of course fine that you use it and understand it that way.
And if people start to use HODL only to mean daytrading or selling their Bitcoin holdings for fiat, then it will be understood that way over time.
