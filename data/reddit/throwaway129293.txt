12:35 am gmaxwell midnightmagic: phantomcircuit is unhappy that people who seem to be openly working against his own efforts trade on his work, and the name of the project. This is a downside of free software, but it's minor compared to the benefits.
12:36 am aj Luke-Jr: easier to get at source for a python program than a c++ one too
12:36 am Luke-Jr we could rename the project and enforce it as a trademark..
12:37 am btcdrak Luke-Jr: "Bitcoin Core" as a phrase is probably trademarkable, but I really dont see the benefit.
12:37 am midnightmagic gmaxwell: The number of netbsd core developers who have expressed raging bitterness just to me in private email that people like broadcomm make millions on their code and don't even contribute their modifications to the original source is more than I can count on one hand. And at the time they wrote me I was a nobody.. :-o
12:37 am Luke-Jr btcdrak: but Hearn coined it
12:37 am in fact, is that a risk to us?
12:37 am gmaxwell No.
12:37 am btcdrak Luke-Jr: no
12:38 am midnightmagic Does the U.S. have a pre-existing trademark exception rule too? 12:38 am I know Canada does.
12:38 am Luke-Jr midnightmagic: I think the GPL would be a bad choice for node software.
12:39 am btcdrak The solution to gavin is what I said it was back in January when no-one would listen to me &gt;.&gt;
12:39 am midnightmagic Luke-Jr: it would hinder its deployment probably. But, ignoring all that I don't think it's realistic anyway. Mostly navel gazing I guess.
12:39 am btcdrak: I'm listening now. Can you link me?
12:40 am In Canada, if you run a shop with a name of something that was trademarked after your use of the term, for as long as you operate you are excepted from trademark infringement. Unless the law has changed. Which is possible, given our recent experiment in neo-fascism.
12:41 am btcdrak We need a technical lobbiest, someone who will go to companies and listen to them and discuss the technology with them. There are other things too, but I wont say them in public.
12:42 am midnightmagic Well that was ideally what the BCF was supposed to do. :-/
12:42 am btcdrak (because they would be used by gavin against us) 12:42 am The BCF is a useless train wreck.
12:42 am the BCF continues to prop up Gavin with the title "Chief Scientist" which gavin uses to mislead the companies he lobbies.
12:42 am Luke-Jr problem: we are understaffed technically already..
12:43 am midnightmagic I was optimistic (hope springs eternal) but I guess phantomcircuit pretty much called it ages ago when they first published the constitution.
12:44 am randy-waterhouse btcdrak: did you specific companies in mind, or some examples?
12:44 am s/did you have/
12:46 am btcdrak randy-waterhouse: no, everyone in general. gavin and mike have gone around telling lies, the only way to counter that is to give taregetted presentations etc.
12:48 am Luke-Jr btcdrak: not just a joint letter saying "you may have been told lies by &lt;people&gt;; we don't know what those lies are, so please take what was said with a grain of salt - we're here to clarify anything"
12:48 am ?
12:49 am btcdrak
Luke-Jr: Yes, we must actively say that. Bitcoin Core devs (as I have said repeatedly in private) are playing into the hands of disruption by being too politically correct and "nice". We need to be prepared to call a spade a spade.
12:49 am Luke-Jr btcdrak: a letter is easier than a presentation, is what I mean.
12:50 am btcdrak Luke-Jr: it's a good start,
12:50 am Luke-Jr: if I was a little richer I would pay someone but I have to preserve my funds because of my health situation which is questionable at the moment. [right out of the Moolah playbook]
12:51 am Luke-Jr btcdrak: hope your health improves :|
12:52 am btcdrak Luje-Jr: yeah ditto! I wish they would find a diagnosis at least.
2:02 am phantomcircuit gmaxwell, to be clear i meant changing the license to specifically bar gavin from using the code for any purpose and only gavin
2:04 am gmaxwell phantomcircuit: pedantically, it would no longer be free software; and doing that would be imposing a huge analysis cost of anyone else using the software; not a good tradeoff.
2:11 am Luke-Jr so I rewatched the "poisonous people" talk (and concluded it doesn't seem to fit Gavin FWIW), and two recommendations that stood out as applicable would be 1) having well-defined and specific goals/todo lists leading up to 1.0; 2) we should [when possible] try to have multiple people familiar with each part of the code - so jgarzik's MAINTAINERS file probably should be laid out expecting multiple maintainers for each subsection
2:12 am I'm not sure either of these are too practical for us, but it might be nice to keep them in the back of our minds
2:17 am btcdrak Luke-Jr: I know wumpus has been planning to slowly increase the number of maintainer for specific areas. The GUI maintainer is a trial. It's part of why  was written.
2:19 am in the longer term as the goals of breaking Core into sub projects like wallet, consensus and full node, we'll already have the maintainer infrastructure in place.
2:19 am Luke-Jr not sure what you mean by a trial.. it's not the first maintainership thing (wumpus began as GUI maintainer, and I've been mining maintainer for a while; I imagine there are others too)
