invest in nuclear fission research instead of giving more and more democratic rights away to the globalists. research positive effects of climate change. invest in sustainable energy and technological efficiency, etc.
There is no need to give the united nations complete control over global migration and industry.  it will turn this world into a prison planet.

gold is heavily manipulated, investors cant retrieve their gold and a lot of paper-gold floats around, alongside govermental dumping. (my country netherlands lost half of its gold supply since the 80ies, stored in the usa. either stolen or forced to sell who knows. they are now desperately trying to retrieve it, as is Germany. Note we used to have one of the largest gold supplies in the world)

exactly! people should read whats in the paris-climate agreement and United nations AGENDA 2030.

UN paris agreement states (1) An annual wealth transfer of 100 billion dollars (60 billion from usa) from the west to 3rd world countries, (2) complete take over of national migration control where the unelected UN bureaucrats can dictate and impose quota of ''climate refugees'' globally on any nation they seem fit (like the sahel people, which had an enormous population boom that destroyed their savannah by woodcutting and overgrazing, causing the sahara to expand into their territory &gt; climate refugees), (3) complete take over of co2/industrial output, where the unelected UN bureaucrats can decide which countries can have industry, which cant, and completely control national economies. 
Its a new world order, a globalist dream, where democracy and self-determination goes to die. They use the good will of people and abuse it by pushing through absurd draconian things like this and nobody is realizing it because who doesnt want to save the planet? 
For the record USA is the only one that did not sign the UN paris agreement and reasons for that you can find above.

starving venezuelans with extreme civil unrest apparently ARE buying bitcoin at record rates. 
If dollar shits the bed, which it will as petrodollar age is coming to an end, the wealth needs to be transfered elsewhere. Bitcoin is one of the possibilities.

you said it yourself Venezuelans are buying bitcoin. their economy is completely collapsed. If we get global collapse people want to store their wealth somewhere. it doesnt just evaporate, only the medium of wealth does.

the money has to go somehwere. Next financial crisis will have very little safe havens and rapid hyperinflation of various currencies including dollar and yuan. initially a dip for bitcoin as people need to sell off for debt or whatever, then a great transfer of wealth.

The point is 3rd party is no longer needed.
