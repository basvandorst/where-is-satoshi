if you've ever listened to the podcast he hosts,  called" let's talk bitcoin", you've heard them mention they're accepting tips via lightning.  
@_date: 2018-10-21 21:02:45
Eventually one coin will dominate.  Others will continue to try,  but likely bitcoin will be it.  Once lightning network takes off, things will get very interesting. 
@_date: 2018-10-30 00:03:40
I think so too. Still up a lot from last year.   I'm not selling! !
@_date: 2019-02-20 11:40:52
This is complete truth. 
@_date: 2019-02-20 11:36:29
It can basically just be water turning a wheel it doesn't have to harm the environment at all.  That's the whole point
@_date: 2019-02-19 01:13:25
@_date: 2019-02-19 02:56:50
Lol "why don't you have a seat right here"
@_date: 2019-02-03 11:39:14
No it can go to anyone
@_date: 2019-02-04 20:14:47
Very true,  and a point not brought up enough.   I would add to it though by mentioning the value should increase due to the deflationary characteristic of bitcoin over time. 
@_date: 2019-02-07 11:51:57
They're both sha256, it shouldn't matter.  You should be able to send it back as if nothing happened.  Idk about that wallet though
@_date: 2019-02-15 19:29:29
It's really not that difficult.  I'm sure saving 2 to 3 percent on every transaction would motivate people. 
@_date: 2019-02-13 10:37:44
And this still protects your private key completely correct? I need to learn more about this 
@_date: 2019-02-18 20:54:31
Might as well, bitcoin will have value,  fiat hasn't for a long time
@_date: 2019-02-18 21:06:14
I'm happy about it.  It was a lesson learned.  Made far more to cover it with btc gains
@_date: 2019-02-20 07:29:22
I think this is the answer I was looking for.  Thank you
@_date: 2019-02-14 19:55:04
You should absolutely do this because bitcoin has value.  Usd does not.  Free bitcoin you win.  Never pay the loan back and live only on crypto 
@_date: 2019-02-14 19:34:22
Lol this can't be real.  Why the fuck would anyone want a crypto pegged to NOTHING.  holy shit these bankers are getting bold with their scams.
@_date: 2019-02-05 04:57:26
People are waking up slowly but surely. There's also a bit of learning that goes into it, which is probably too complicated for most people.  It's getting easier though. 
@_date: 2019-02-15 19:30:20
Jamie is the biggest troll in the universe
@_date: 2019-02-08 07:07:03
Please elaborate for me
@_date: 2019-02-15 19:34:55
International law states that in this situation "finders keepers". 
@_date: 2019-02-18 20:41:17
Send me money and I'll buy your btc for you and send it to you and keep no records of it
@_date: 2019-02-12 19:46:35
Yes raise the usd value of bitcoin.... bitcoin needs to be pumped some more by the fake money
@_date: 2019-02-07 22:14:22
It's still faster by a long shot than using a bank. 
@_date: 2019-02-18 22:33:30
I have some for sale in my van over here. Hop in. 
@_date: 2019-02-11 00:13:22
Really they're going to bitch about"defacement"... in my opinion mass inflation and printing of paper and calling it money is defacement 
@_date: 2019-02-14 19:41:17
Banks are irrelevant with bitcoin.  Also the fact that bitcoin is decentralized and hard capped, with no bullshit roger ver or some other person trying to profit from controlling it.  Bitcoin will be the future without a doubt. There's no other way.  
@_date: 2019-02-08 07:45:12
I was under the impression they were inherently correlated. Cool 
@_date: 2019-02-20 02:33:21
Lol don't listen to him. He's trolling. Not true at all
@_date: 2019-02-14 19:47:48
A database with a single point of failure. 
@_date: 2019-02-07 21:00:24
The addresses are the same that's how
@_date: 2019-02-09 10:12:05
I appreciate you buying my coins at the top
@_date: 2019-02-14 19:38:04
And 0 value
@_date: 2019-02-08 06:38:00
I must have not understood the question.  If he sent funds to a bch address it shouldn't be any different than to a Btc address. 
@_date: 2019-02-18 22:35:39
Look up mining calculators, it does the math for you.  You just need to know your hash rate, power cost and then you're good
@_date: 2019-02-16 20:34:31
Thanks for the info.  Seems like a bit of a chore but if I could safely use my coins from my cold storage that would be awesome
@_date: 2019-02-14 19:37:36
This.  So much.  It's hard to believe they think they can commit such an act.  I feel bad for anyone fucking stupid enough to buy this. 
@_date: 2019-02-20 21:19:55
No one gives a shit about bch. Btc is king
@_date: 2019-02-11 20:39:38
These fuckin people are criminals.  There's nothing more to it.  Bitcoin is really the only hope for our future against the scum corrupt politicians and bankers.  It actually makes me sick watching them manipulate the money.  Such bullshit
@_date: 2019-02-18 20:59:22
Lol no idea.  I've only ever owned one eth, and I got scammed by a fake crypto trader bot and lost it.  It seems like a viable option, just mail a trusted party cash and they send you your btc. No need for kyc etc
@_date: 2019-02-18 20:51:30
Fiat has ZERO fucking value
@_date: 2019-02-10 19:47:03
Anyone want to buy my casa node? Or my 12 antminer s9s?
@_date: 2018-11-26 11:58:15
How many payments are routed through your node daily?  Curious about income from a node 
@_date: 2018-11-20 09:14:43
Btc could easily be replaced,  but it won't be,  because none of the other coins are doing anything revolutionary, and also they've most all been created by a single entity with biased self interest and greed. I'd like to hear what it is that other coins are doing better?  As far as I can tell Btc has the most robust and secure chain,  with the least centralization. If you want fast transactions on chain,  you'll have to compromise on security, unless you use a side chain or 2nd layer like lightning.  
@_date: 2018-11-24 21:22:18
I have a good amount of btc in cold storage and its not moving anywhere soon.  I also have a lot of credit card debt that I've used for investing into my businesses,  but once tax season comes, I get enough back to pay it all off, once the government gives me back the money they stole. 
@_date: 2018-11-23 20:43:24
I've only ever used my public key on paper wallets that I print offline, without any issues?  It seems as though there is confusion among users.  I saw a few articles claiming they're the same? 
@_date: 2018-11-21 13:31:52
Good clip
@_date: 2018-11-23 12:50:11
It says public key on it?  
@_date: 2018-11-21 05:42:30
That's only your opinion.  I find quite a lot of value in money that is secure and can't be printed into oblivion.
@_date: 2018-11-19 09:15:17
Who is it losing to?  You obviously have no clue what you're saying.  Mass adoption takes time,  and is about to happen.  It is happening right now. 
@_date: 2018-11-21 05:58:16
Everyone please sell,  keep the price crashing.  So we can load up on some more cheap coins :)
@_date: 2018-11-20 09:20:30
I don't care what the price does.  Btc isn't going anywhere.  The concept of sound money is all I care about.  The inflated USD makes me sick. 
@_date: 2018-11-21 13:12:23
I'd send some
@_date: 2019-01-21 11:20:08
You have proven to me and the world that you haven't the slightest clue about how any of this works,  or you're just trolling. You clearly have no idea how absolutely giant of an operation you need to ever hope of finding a block by solo mining.  It won't happen.  A solo miner with even 50 antminer s9s would likely never find a block. That's great that you broke down the numbers,  but even pools with hundreds of thousands of miners running and a large portion of the overall network hash power still go extended periods without finding a block.  I know because I mine.
@_date: 2018-11-22 23:12:06
It can't be printed is its greatest strength.  You clearly don't understand the issue with fiat currencies. 
@_date: 2019-01-11 00:14:14
If people stopped deriving value from fake money it wouldn't matter
@_date: 2019-01-07 06:01:32
There's nothing to test if you understand how it works
@_date: 2019-01-07 06:54:51
I understand you. I agree
@_date: 2019-01-21 18:10:43
I never said your numbers were correct.  I'm glad you admit to trolling though lol. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 09:45:54
You're unfortunately misinformed. The forks have nothing to do with btc, and they are not bitcoin. Btc is not centralized at all.  Do a little research about bitcoin, it's a great thing. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 09:49:11
Still didn't mention what other coins do better? 
@_date: 2018-11-30 22:12:06
I've thought about this.  Wouldn't solve the corruption unfortunately though. 
@_date: 2019-01-28 22:42:58
This is not true.  Dispensaries have been doing this for a long time.  I think this is a marketing ploy
@_date: 2019-01-21 20:06:21
Lol happy hodling
@_date: 2019-01-21 03:02:20
Without a pool you will have 0 income from mining unless you have a massive farm that you run solo
@_date: 2019-01-10 15:27:58
Please elaborate.  I've always thought about this
@_date: 2018-11-20 10:11:56
Clearly you do not have even a basic understanding of these concepts,  hence why you aren't willing to have a discussion on it. 
@_date: 2019-01-21 02:52:34
Mining in a pool is literally your only chance of finding a block.  Unless you have an enormous mining facility
@_date: 2019-01-07 06:03:07
Wrong.  You can transmit transactions through a variety of other means
@_date: 2019-01-25 09:23:48
I was about to comment this.  It is in no way a cold wallet if it's on a phone.

I have 12 s9s sitting in boxes anyone want to buy them? They're dirty but they work.  And include the power supply units
@_date: 2019-01-21 18:17:10
His answer is basically correct as a legal answer,  the people who make the laws and print the fake money don't want it to be easy to use because they'll be irrelevant quickly
@_date: 2018-11-20 04:04:41
Apparently no one posting in here has a clue what they're talking about.
@_date: 2019-01-27 10:17:28
If she truly understood it she wouldn't be opposed to it. 
@_date: 2018-11-22 13:35:32
Only alt coins have failed.  Bitcoin is not even remotely dead,  or injured. 
@_date: 2018-11-23 11:18:48
Get a Casa node
@_date: 2018-11-23 01:38:45
This is the safest option
@_date: 2018-12-14 11:31:07
Profit how, from the government?  All you have to do is make good decisions and you'll be in a much better place.  
@_date: 2018-12-29 02:19:45
I could debate your points all day.  Your worldview is entirely based on what someone has told you,  with zero empirical evidence.  My worldview oh the other hand is based entirely on my own evidences and conclusions. Until you base everything you believe on something you personally have witnessed or seen,  you might as well be gossiping in a school yard.
@_date: 2018-12-11 00:22:02
It's good for them of course.  Not good for customers.  My miners were supposed to be profitable,  and weren't when they finally arrived months later,  with antpool already configured in the system
@_date: 2018-12-11 14:04:07
Not sure naming your company after one of the scummiest companies ever is a good idea lol
@_date: 2018-12-28 22:27:27
Not to be rude but your comments come across as phony and uninformed.  I'm not saying trump is a saint,  but it's hard for me to listen to people bitch about Trump and try to paint him as evil.  It makes you come across as a lefty triggered lib who doesn't know why he is upset.  When you start thinking logically you'll see that Trump is actually better than many presidents we've had, and better than any career politician like Hillary  could ever be. 
@_date: 2018-12-25 10:01:19
It's like 5 bucks a month right now but once you're well established it could be more,  plus mass adoption will increase it.  
@_date: 2018-12-07 22:33:06
How could you not have "let's talk bitcoin?"  Andreas A is one of the main hosts.  He's not on every episode though.   Guaranteed to be the best btc podcast I promise.  Check it out. 
@_date: 2018-12-10 19:19:58
After all the shady things they did like use my miners before sending them to me,  I don't feel bad. 
@_date: 2018-12-29 02:10:06
Those are all theories, and situations taken out of context with no real factual basis, skewed to fit your narrative,  and you've just proven my point exactly.  
@_date: 2018-12-22 00:34:20
It's all out there I don't know any specific sites but  it involves offline generated wallets that aren't tied to you at all. 
@_date: 2018-12-14 11:54:59
That's one seriously flawed logic in the context of money or bitcoin. A kid can't make you any money for like 10 years at least.  It would be way more sensible to just get your life together instead of diving into ruin. 
@_date: 2018-12-14 07:48:27
Who cares about apple. It's irresponsible to have kids if you're starving
@_date: 2018-12-04 03:36:12
The best metric to look at for btc is the speed of inflation and money printing on the failing USD.  :)
@_date: 2018-12-19 23:53:29
No.  Just no.  
@_date: 2018-12-14 05:24:31
Maybe don't have 6 kids?  Unless the goal was to be poor 
@_date: 2018-12-12 08:51:45
That's debatable. 
@_date: 2018-12-19 23:40:27
You download the generator and use it offline, with an offline printer and also verify that the generator is verified and legit. It's a single key because it's one time usefor storing btc. When it comes time to take out of storage you move them then to a newly generated address when you're done spending. 
@_date: 2018-12-09 20:33:33
That's simply not true
@_date: 2018-12-12 08:31:36

If you don't know how to do a completely anonymous transaction,  you should do some research.  The transaction is obviously always recorded publicly,  but it's very easy to make it completely untraceable to you. 
@_date: 2018-12-09 20:41:51
Let's see some hard evidence to back up your baseless claims.  You've got to remember they're talking to millions of newcomers and so they have to keep it from getting overly technical.  The woman host is a PhD... AA is completely transparent and I have a hunch the issue is your ability to understand the topics.
@_date: 2018-12-20 04:35:38
Obviously.  We're talking about investments here.  Having too many kids is not a solid investment strategy but good luck to you out there lol
