It's a very great concept, but it has been poorly executed.
No official GUI (or well, not for the first 2 years), a very strange deflationary price for registering domains, coin loss, and I don't think the merged mining does the currency any good at all.

It's web 2.0, it runs in the cloud!

MD5 is as worthless as a simple checksum now, I don't see why so many people still publish MD5 hashes for their executables...

I remember getting 50000 Ripples on a Bitcointalk-giveaway, I sold them for 1BTC which I sold for 20$ or so.
Strange system. I don't like it a lot, but I still regret not holding onto them.

I know why you're getting downvoted, but it's a semi-valid point. Setting up a dual-boot to Linux, and installing nothing but packages from the distros repo, would not be a bad setup to run Bitcoin on. It would be a lot safer compared to Windows.

I run a Linux-distro myself, so obviously I believe it is 'the best choice', but I can understand why some people are better off with Windows: problems with hardware support, very specific software that doesn't run under Wine, certain videogames...
I could recommend a dual-boot for those who want the best of both worlds, and in this case Linux certainly is more secure (if you stick to the provided repos).

2 and a half whole G's. Only the highest quality hand-made ones, of course.

9/11 WAS AN INSIDE JOB.

It was hilarious. Who in their right mind would hoard TRC?
Shame for the XPM though. :(

Take out a few, buy yourself something nice, transfer the rest to a cold storage wallet - forget for another few years. Rinse and repeat! Congratulations on your Bitcoin recovery though!

I am the 1%, or something...
