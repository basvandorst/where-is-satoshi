What if 99% of miners left and all we had left were CPU miners? It would take a serious amount of time for people to buy chips and set them up. 
Although miners are independent of each other, each miner represents a bernoulli trial with some probability of success. More miners means more trials. We can model this as a poisson process. Less miners means lambda is smaller (less successes in some period). Meaning it takes longer for a success to happen on average.

I don't think so. I am saying that 2mb supporters are saying we have more transactions now so we must increase the blocksize. I am saying, that is not a good reason by itself to increase the blocksize. If that logic holds true, then you are agreeing to increasing to 10gb once the entire planet joins the network and starts using it. Of course increasing it along the way. I do hear the slippery slope argument here, but don't think I'm being totally unreasonable here.


Is increasing the blocksize the only way to get fees down? Better fee prediction tools, aggregated transactions, other layers (2 and 3) ( 
Sure there is a problem NOW that fees are higher than people would want to pay, but I don't see why it is unusable. There is a price to pay, that is the cost of use. Does it allow coffee transactions? No, does it not allow movement of 100,000$ within hours for fractions of a percent? Yes.
I'm not sure how low fees would be considered usable, with 2mb blocks you may still have fee problems in terms of coffee, who wants to pay 1 or 2%.


It has nothing to do with what happened 9 years ago, it has to do with what is current. There are other alternatives to an increase, they have pros and cons to each one, I just don't think 2mb is the only way to go and the comment I was replying to made it seem like it was a mistake to avoid increasing the blocksize, I think it is a choice that has pros and cons.
@_date: 2017-11-11 06:50:19


I agree, being 2mb or something else. However 2mb is a start down the road to something we may regret later on.


Sure the internet can handle it, but people also need have the download/upload capabilities, I sometimes only get 30/10mb down/up load, this is not just to myself, but to other nodes around me. But here to I agree 2mb is not so bad, but going farther will be bad.


Why not?


I should have been more clear, specifically with a only blocksize increase (to say gb blocks) it will be hard for individuals to create raspberry pi or standard pc nodes. This is because people will likely spam blocks when there are low fees.
I want to reiterate that I don't have an opinion on what is best for Bitcoin in terms of transaction or settlement layer. Furthermore, I am not against a 2mb increase, but rather I am against moving down a road that will eventually not allow Bitcoin to be either.
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:25:39


Here the proof is that exactly the same logic is valid with 2mb blocks as it would be with 10mb blocks. If we need to increase the blocksize every time the mempool is full and tx fees are considered "too high" for what people want, then if and when bitcoin grows to 10s of millions of users, it might seem logical that we continue increasing the blocksize. This isn't a drastically different scenario, this is the exact same scenario just in the future. Setting a precedent that mempool full and fees too high (whatever that means at the moment) is a precedent that I think we should keep in mind.
I am not saying that we shouldn't do 2mb, rather I am saying we should be careful.


I agree, but precedents allow changes to happen more easily. As the community grows from hobbyists and technical people to the masses, it will be easier to sway the community to a 4mb fork if a 2mb fork is done today. "See, last time there wasn't a problem, so why not now"
@_date: 2017-11-14 15:01:03
This is a tough problem, wallets need to predict what others will spend before they spend it.
The top ~2000 Sat/Byte (weighted if SegWit) will go in. Let's a block has just gone in and the mempool is empty, how much should your wallet suggest? It needs to figure out how much the other people trying to get into this block are willing to pay, minimize that amount so that it is in the top 2000, but not below that. 
The wallet software must also look at average transaction for previous weeks (for specific days), anomalies in the total hashrate (I'm look at you EDA), market news factors, etc. This is a hard ML problem. A bad approximation is the SMA of the past x hours. This does NOT seem to be working, but does anyone have an alternative? If yes, contribute :)
CT and CoinJoin may help with this as we aggregate transactions into one bigger TX.
@_date: 2017-11-11 00:56:58
Increasing the blocksize is not a long term fix. 
if 1mb blocks aren't enough and we need more, say scale from millions of users to tens of millions of users, then we would need 10 mb blocks. Once we want 100s of millions of users, then 100mb block? What about the entire world, 10gb blocks? That is still not microtransactions, you would need petabyte blocks to scale to that.
Why is large blocks a problem, data is cheap?
Because there is a limit to how fast we can transmit data between nodes, if it takes too long to transmit a block from one node to another, then you will have many nodes in middle of downloading one block when another one comes in (creating possible re-orgs and attack vectors). This is the fundamental tradeoff between block size and average block time.
Furthermore, if blocks get too big, average computers will not be able to have full nodes, leading to more centralizations and less security.
I'm not saying that an increase in the blocksize is fundamentally bad, rather, another layer is likely the solution if you want to see the whole world you BTC as a transaction layer, if you want it to be a settlement later, then who care what people do on another layer, layer 1 is good enough as it is.

I'm sure Bittrex, YoBit and HitBTC will accept them eventually. One DA (even if it takes a couple months) and it'll be just another altcoin, but here we have millions of people airdropped coins. Especially if coinbase doesn't support its millions of coins.

There is no such thing as BTC and B2X on the blockchain, these are tickers created by exchanges/people to differentiate between coins, there is a blockchain that contains balances, this blockchain may be forked mid november.
Think about the blockchain, loosely, as an excel spreadsheet with three columns: From, To, and Amount. To find someone's balance simply sum the number of coins that have been sent (From == user's address) and subtract that from coins received (To == user's address).
Every (around) 10 minutes, a whole bunch of rows get added to this spreadsheet with new transactions. When we say a miner mined a block, we mean added a block of transactions onto the blockchain/spreadsheet.
Ok now that we have a good analogy for the Bitcoin blockchain we can talk about forks semi-intelligibly.
When there is a fork, using our analogy, you can think of it as a copy of the spreadsheet being created. Everyone who had balances on one sheet has the same balances on the other sheet. The difference is how many miners, users, merchants, exchanges and developers use each sheet. If everyone only looks at one spreadsheet, then that is the one that has value. The market decides what the value is for both sheets.
Now, do you get free B2X coins? if the sheet is copied (forked), then if you have control of the address (private key) then you will get a balance on both sheets. The market will decide the price of the other coins on both sheets. This is true for any fork.


You will have the equivalent balance on both blockchains, the market will decide what the price of those two coins are worth, the exchanges will decide which sheet(s) they will support (B2X means they have to upgrade their code/add new code), merchants will decide which sheet(s) they will accept as payment, users will decide which sheet(s) they are going to transact and relay transactions with, the developers will decide which sheet(s) they will develop on and miners will decide which of the two sheets they will mine on at any given time (they can switch back and forth).
So will you be:


Yes, but it might be worth zero or BTC might be worth zero. At the time of the fork (and any other fork) you will have balances on both chains/sheets, if people don't accept one of the chains/sheets, then the coins don't matter. Forks happen all the time, just usually they aren't pre-planned and contentious. 
Will both coins have value? ..... thats for the market to decide.
Will B2X + BTC &gt; BTC before fork? Maybe
PS: I've ignored all transactions/scripts that are not simple 1 input -&gt; 1 output transactions to make this much easier.

I think the author of this article is entangling SegWit with 2x, these are separate. SegWit has already been activated.


Potentially faster confirmation times, the transactions themselves will still take 10 minutes on average per block.


This is misleading, it allows for more data/transaction to be stored in each block, there is no network limit, there is a block limit.
What does:


"Future changes" and "some analysts" is way too vague. The softfork that happened in August allowed for changes to the OP codes to be softforks in the future.


It is?

Bitcoin uses SHA256 as it's hashing function. A hashing function is a function that takes in some input and maps it to another. BTG will use Equihash.
Why does BTC use hashing functions?
Proof of Work (PoW) verifies that the miner adding the transactions to the blockchain have actually put in effort to the network and it is hard for anyone that is not committed to add transactions. For this reason, 12.5 (as of 2017) BTC are awarded to the miner that solves a puzzle. You can think of this puzzle as a lottery, the more hashing power (as defined by the number of SHA256 hashes you can do), the more tickets you have in the lottery.
SHA256 is computationally hard, memory/space easy.
Equihash is memory/RAM hard (
Ethereum and ZCash use Equishash style hashing functions for PoW. BTC miners are using ASIC (specialized chips) for SHA256 mining and would have to do more work to switch to BTG than a ZCash or Ethereum miner.
