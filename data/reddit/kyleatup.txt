If Russia decided to go full bitcon, it would be a pivotal moment in the downfall of the US, and central banking as a whole. They could finally "defeat" America.

Are you out of Bits?

I would also be willing to receive some of my paycheck in bitcoin, and i would imagine some of my coworkers wouldnt mind either, I am guessing this would be a little more tricky to implement.

My boss was actually looking at have $10,000 held in bitcoin, but yeah, it looks like going though BitPay might be the best solution. 
He also mentions that he would want the tenants to pay for any extra fees, so if there was a 2% exchange fee from Bitpay, he would want the tenant to cover that.

What did the crypto currency investor say when he saw that a premine was being dumped onto the market?
Time to get out of Dodge

Free, Peaceful, Voluntary Market would all be good choices.

this scenario is not very likely in a stateless society, 
If there was a stateless society, there would be no tax income system for this warlord guy to talk control of. Can you imagine a military group going door to door threatening the local populous to start paying monthly/yearly dues? 
because of this difficulty it would be much more profitable for a warlord to go into a country with an existing tax structure and try to gain control of it. 
It is like a farmer that wants to expand his farm. He can either go next door and kill the existing farmer and take his land and livestock, or he can go into the forest on the other side of his farm and go through intense labor clearing the land, while being threatened by wild savage animals (I imagine stateless societies would have lots of awesome weapons). 
Thanks for the curiosity!

16"For Cthulhu so loved the world he gave his only begotten genesis block, and whoever moves into the bitcoin ecosystem will help cause to legacy banking to perish, and have eternal funds on the blockchain (unless you spend them).

I was have been using multibit wallet, they have a feature which lets you track the ledger, it shows which address you receive from, and you can edit each address to identify which tenant/rental address the payment is coming from. We would have to make sure the payment was sent from the original wallet address to not run into any problems.

yeah, that is why i am looking towards alternatives to using this method, I was looking on coinbase, and they have some pretty cool solutions for their payment systems. I also applied for bitpay. I mostly just want to check it out.
