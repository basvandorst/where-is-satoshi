There's likely a second definition there, you think?

It's unbelievably simplistic in almost every respect. That people swallow it up and upvote it to the front of the sub is very concerning.

It's funny to see this, surrounded by dozens of far more butthurt comments from @_date: 2014-05-07 21:11:54
The trouble is that the log scale makes the growth look much more stable than it really is. A fold change of 2 (HUGE consequences) is just a little dip on the log graph. The human brain is designed to work linearly, which is why you must be careful when you see log scales.
edit: Just some graphs for comparison:
Log Scale: Everything looks fine, the last six months are almost flat!
Linear Scale: Holy shit, the last six months looks disastrous!
Of course I've oversimplified it here, but the difference is VAST. Do you think the second graph with an exponential fit copied over it would be upvoted to the top? No way.

How have you linked the image problem and the price? Is there any quantitative backing to the claim? I don't think there is, and all you're doing is pulling this out of your ass: much like OP and seemingly half of the people on this subreddit.
If there's an image problem it's people like OP saying it will be worth 10k in a year's time that are responsible.
