Think of this as asking "can i get yen from someone who doesnt have yen"

Make sure you are verified and connect a bank account, it is the best way to increase your limit.
You cannot put USD directly into GDAX with a card

You always have to go through an exchange. Yen was an example, but imagine a country's currency that isn't easily accessible.

Trading out of coinbase is more expensive than putting coins into GDAX (for free, gdax/coinbase being the same thing and all) and then transferring out.

First customer is trying to meet him in the middle of Sinaloa, Mexico

Theres never a truly good time to jump in,
Id throw some in (money you are comfortable to lose of course) and watch what happens
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:03:44
 FYI, in case you didn't know,
If you are going to send coins anywhere from your coinbase wallet, send it to GDAX first, the fees are smaller
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:16:15
The price would have tp go down significantly for you to make up the difference,
The gamble is about as likely as hodling for a price rise 
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:32:04
Make sure ur id pic is good and that u did it on a computer, not on the app,
The app is ass for verification 
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:11:56
Transfer to GDAX first then go to gemini/binance
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:01:12
lol i came in as the peak was falling, bought at an avaerage of about 16k,
I knew what i signed up for. I HODL.
