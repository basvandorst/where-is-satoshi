I started with bitcoin than discovered alt-coin and believe that they are cheaper and more useful and is great to have him but as I come to understand more about bitcoin and decentralisation it the only one that works with some like me. I’m Libyan I will be forever denied access to exchanges because of KYC and we could be refused access or usage of altcoins due to being from a certain country plus our country ( Libya ) is trying really hard to stop bitcoin and central bank issued a warning to use it or own it and working fast to legally banning people ( we know this not possible ) but I am sure if Facebook issues their coin our government will ban it and Facebook has to restrict us from using it which bring us back to the beginning 
With bitcoin at least we get a certain assurance this won’t happen in the future

In the interview he gives an example for a guy wanting to escape Libya with war and army conflict and needs to transfer money but can’t due to no local banks allow transfer money in or out and can’t even withdraw your money because they only allow you to take $100 a week and there is now western union or others. Also by law you are not allowed to carry more than $10,000 in cash while travelling for personal reasons or gold or anything of value.
I discovered bitcoin in early 2017 and tested it with Moving my money but could actually find a lot of people selling it locally in Libya i only found 5 coins in 6 months but couldn’t believe that it actually worked and there was solution and no one can stop me and my money 
I took me over a year to move $500k out of Libya and I paid close to 8000 in fees and buying tickets back and fort to carry the cash plus tickets for family to help me 
I have been a believer in bitcoin ever since and I hope to start a career in bitcoin some how. Right now I teach Arabic speaking people ( Libyan ) and others about money and bitcoin and I also personally spend time one to one to show them how to open a wallet and buy it whilst buying bitcoin and selling to people in Libya as they are limited there since we can buy from exchanges for two reason one is our identity and we can link our bank account or use debt cards.
Thanks for reading

I used amazon.com to buy products in USA and have them shipped to Libya by my friend I got loads of clients that are interested to buy loads that day I have been waiting for the moment that I can use my bitcoin to make the process easier and lower down the cost since I have to send money with western union or pay loads of fees ( clients is charged ) using other methods of payments 
Do you guys have another solution or maybe your interested we can work together on this ?

People need to realise how great this is for people like me in North Africa region and developing countries we struggle so much under the control of central banks and corruption of governments we are cut or from the rest of the world finically and this is a good start for us since people use FB and it gets them to understand why crypto and how it’s done we need this we need this so we can get our selves out of this blood sucking wars and evil politicians 
Peace a guy from Libya
