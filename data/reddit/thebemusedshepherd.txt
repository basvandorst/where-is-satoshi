You need to get money on to an exchange first. I'm going to assume you're in Canada, and  I'd recommend  over coinsquare.io, though coinbase.com (I know) is probably quicker and takes credit cards. To get money back out in CAD, you'll need one of the first two. 
To buy coins other than BTC, ETH, LTC, BCH you'll need to transfer funds (crypto) to an exchange like Gemini or Bitfinex. Then you can invest in such joys as XMR, IOTA and many others. My general rule is that if you haven't read and understood the white paper, it's not for you. 
Then sit back and wait for a few months. If your gains become significant, look to transfer to a non-custodial wallet like blockchain.info for ETH and BTC, and SAVE YOU DAMN SEED. 
Read more, listen to more podcasts and generally try to understand a coin before you put any money into it - BTC included.

I know there are a lot of new people getting into BTC and cryto, but surely if you're bothering to read articles on Coindesk you must have some vague idea about Lightning at least...

Government legal tender - so CAD or USD.

Coinsquare.io is Canadian but meh. 
Fees are ok if you do a bank transfer but it takes a week to get fiat in that way. Interact email money transfer fee is 5%. I asked why so high, the answer was "demand".
Also their BTC prices are way higher than other exchanges, so you're essentially paying a 5-10% premium on that too - just for buying Canadian.
Short answer - haven't found one but will keep looking.
