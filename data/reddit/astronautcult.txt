Can someone explain how the PSU is considered "optional"? It's what is said on their website.

I went to buy some btc in Toronto a bit ago and was really impressed! There was actually a short line for people tonuse the machine! The economy is alive.

I'm actually in Calgary, Canada. I think my next step would be to contact the mall to get a quote on the rental space. I would need to calculate if it would be worth it.
In Calgary, there's 3 ATMs in coffee shops, and another in a building downtown. 
However, there are none in the south of the city.

Thanks for the info! I didn't realize there were already so many. I'll have to do some rethinking.

What are your bubble burst price predictions?

I studied there, my university is a fucking joke.

We're so close to 1k in CAD!

Dear crackmacs, don't worry about that, I'm actually from Calgary and I'm in Toronto for a tech internship and will bring back lots of bitcoin love back ;)
@_date: 2016-06-16 06:49:36
I'll check it out! Thanks

To the moon eh?

Toronto has an exciting and vibrant BTC scene :)
@_date: 2016-06-24 02:02:40
Hopefully it will be the bitcoin blockchain not FEDCoin™, MapleCoin™, or EuroCoin™'s

But why? Is it for a more predictable payout? Doesn't PPLNS result in slightly higher payouts in the longterm?
@_date: 2016-09-13 03:13:43
So...what's the difference between this and antPool on PPLNS (which has 0%)?

I have a feeling the day will come and go without spectacle

For voting it might make sense IMO 
@_date: 2016-07-15 16:37:23
Umm what I get from that chart is that it's about to go down? 
@_date: 2016-07-09 07:19:08
Amazing! The developing markets are prime targets for btc.
@_date: 2016-07-11 18:42:36
Can someone explain how this would work? Where does mining come in? Would a bitcoin-like token be a vote?
