I know you were mixed up, but there is actually a way all the coins could "go away" in a sense - they could all be sent to burner addresses like [1BitcoinEaterAddressDontSendf59kuE](  Nobody has the private key to that addresses, so those coins (currently 1.98129450 BTC) will never be able to leave that address.

Wall Street handles a lot more than 7 transactions per second.  The fee is not the major issue here if T0 is aiming to be a Wall Street replacement.  Currently there is no way to get around this limitation while having individual verifications on the Bitcoin blockchain.
Edit: as another comment said (which seems to have been removed?), paying higher fees will work - until the spam/low priority transactions can't get into the Bitcoin blockchain anymore.  What happens when T0 starts to compete with legitimate transactions for inclusion?  Is "the solution ... to pay a higher fee" still the correct one when you are driving out other txs that should be included?

I know you didn't ask about this, but have you backed up your Bitcoin Core (/Bitcoin-qt) wallet recently?  While an Electrum wallet is generated by a seed that can reveal all your addresses if needed, Bitcoin Core randomly generates new addresses when you ask for one.  
e.g. if you made a backup of your Bitcoin Core wallet.dat, it would have had the first 100 (or so) addresses backed up.  If you have since used all those up and Bitcoin Core has now generated new addresses, those new addresses (numbers 101+) are not backed up.  Make sure you back up Bitcoin Core every once in a while to get the new addresses.

The point is that with, say, a Trezor, that you would backup the seed (on a non-digital media) so that if the Trezor goes bad you can recover the coins.  All you need to get this to work properly is just one Trezor and sufficient and secure backup(s) of the seed.

Anecdotal evidence: A few days ago I was trying to buy a Humble Bundle through Bitcoin.  The payments didn't go through in time for the processing window and now I'm having to follow up to make sure that I get my games/bitcoin back.  I used the default fees.
And yes, those fees was reasonable.  If some say that my fee wasn't what is needed now, then fine - but then the "disaster" is of me not being able to use my bitcoins as I want, as I was able to previously do, and in the way that attracted me to Bitcoin in the first place.  I personally am much less likely to use Bitcoin for my next Humble Bundle purchase because of this experience.

No problem.  It seems that Blockchain.info has had another problem today too.

First of all, you should read [related comment](
* Blockchain.info has had several security issues in the past - resulting in lost and stolen coins for users, etc.
* Blockchain.info does much more than just a being a web wallet - which means their wallet is probably receiving less attention than dedicated wallet apps.
* Also, their name can be confusing to Bitcoin newcomers - there's a big difference between "blockchain" (the Bitcoin one) and "Blockchain" (the .info one), yet new Bitcoin users won't always realize this.  I've stopped using Blockchain.info altogether because of how this can confuse new Bitcoin users, and when I do mention it, I always make sure to use "Blockchain.info" to clarify.
* I'm sure there's more, but these are the ones that came to mind just now.  
In general web wallets are less secure than local wallets just because of how they have to work.  While wallets like Blockchain.info may be good for the new Bitcoin user, they are far from optimal for anyone who continues to use Bitcoin or who invests any significant amount.  I suggest looking through the Bitcoin.org [Choose your Bitcoin wallet]( page to learn more about the different wallets - pros and cons are listed with explanations.

Well, why not?  It's a nice thing to do.  :)  And it raises adoption of Bitcoin, which means that what we have is more valuable.

The limit is eventually raised to about 7.6 gb, but that is in 2036.  I misunderstood you because most refer to it as an 8 mb increase (despite the continuing increase afterwards)  
Also, there is not urgency to raise the blocksize limit to 8 gb right now - this is preemptively trying to prevent future problems.  You recently (and repeatedly) said "Why not wait until real demand actually causes real need (assuming LN isn't developed by then), and then implement a one-time code increase. What is the urgency?"  Do you think that we will all suddenly agree when there is "real need", or will it be another drawn-out debate like what we're having now?  Is there only "real need" when 100% of blocks are full, or would there be "real need" when there are consistent spikes of activity with multi-block confirmation waits?  And even if consensus is reached that there is indeed "real need", it won't be easy to proceed from there.  How much larger should this "one-time code increase" be?  Just large enough to support all the current transactions, or, if larger, for how long should this increase be planned to work for?  Do you understand my issues with this approach?  
I believe that there will be a spot for the LN regardless of whether the cap is raised or not in the area of instant confirmations.  The fees remain to be seen, but with any luck they will make the LN an attractive alternative option to transacting on the main chain - but I want to be able to spend my coins on the main chain as I wish, without exorbitant fees and/or confirmation times.  
One pillar of Bitcoin currently is decentralization - but the LN will decrease this, even if only slightly (through the usage of "hubs" - please correct me if wrong).  I will also be more excited about LN when it has gained further real usage traction.  As for centralization through XT usage, from what I know this isn't as large a concern as some make it out to be.  What type of centralization are you talking about?
Another of the things that has led me to support an increase in size is the thinking that hard forks are a necessary tool that should be used to improve Bitcoin when needed, not something that should be avoided at all costs.  I would gladly support another single-increase plan if I knew that part of the grand vision for that plan was to repeatedly increase the blocksize when needed again, but I view supporting XT as the best way for me to show support for hard forking as needed.  And if we can fork to support XT, we can later fork if there is a reason to do so (example: move away from BIP 101 if it isn't working out well).  If we can't hard fork Bitcoin, I believe that means we've lost a lot of potential.  
P.S.: I just looked through some of your post history - thank you for working to improve Bitcoin the ways you do through posts like those.

Dynamic fees != low fees
These "dynamic" fees start at 3x the current "normal" fee, but both the "normal" and these "dynamic" fees will rise if blocks are full.  (Hopefully you can understand this without explanation.)
Thus, those who believe that "low/no fees" are a critical part of Bitcoin (should) have one reason to support bigger blocks - to keep fees down.  Basically, bigger blocks mean lower fees.  
(Edit: the above depends of course on your definition of the "low" in "low fees".)
One other question - you said "to 8 freaking Gigabytes".  Where did you get the "Gigabytes" from?  You do realize that BIP 101 (XT) raises the maximum blocksize to 8 megabytes (mb, not gb), right?  Edit: I meant short-term raise to 8 mb.

If you're interested you could also look into a full node software other than Bitcoin Core.  For example, running [Bitcoin XT]( (a Bitcoin Core fork that is very similar) shows your support for larger blocks (even though they aren't implemented in XT yet), and adds 3 improvements/changes.  Note: Core and XT are currently completely compatible, and they use the same resource folders.  You could quit Core and start up XT and then go back if you wanted.  (This may change in future versions, but it is true now.)
