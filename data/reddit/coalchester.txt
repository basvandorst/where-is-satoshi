They do work against people using decentralized networks. Despite "record high anti-piracy spending", do you think people would use bittorrent much if they seriously expected jail time or worse?

Interesting, thank for the info.
For what it's worth, I checked about the possibility of account number abuse with my bank, and they claim the only case they're allowed to set up a direct debit without the account owner's physical presence is for the benefit of a limited number of well know recipients, e.g. gas or electric company.

It looks like this is not specific to the U.S. Apparently, Jeremy Clarkson published his bank details in the newspaper at one point to prove that you can't do anything malicious with just that, and got scammed out of 500 GBP which went to charity.
But I'm amazed that banks would have such lax procedures! Anyone making payments to your bank account by definition has your name, address, and account number, and that's all it takes for them to clean out your account?

Bitstamp commented on this on bitcointalk:


They also claim they will reimburse the loss:

The average price for the past 6 months is around 500. People buying for the past 6 months are still over 10% ahead, at the moment.

I think I remember reading this last week.

So starting at the all time high, the worst possible moment to invest in Bitcoin history (in hindsight)? They're 18% down.
Obviously, there are people who invested at the high only, and those who traded badly on top. There are also those whose investments went down with Gox. So potential losses at any point are always nearing 100%.
But I think it's worth noting that:
1) investing at the worst possible time in Bitcoin history
2) and faithfully keeping at it for 4 months
3) all the way down to the catastrophic failure of the most prominent exchange
4) leaves you at -18%
That doesn't seem too bad to me for a highly risky, potentially extremely profitable investment. I've taken worse from serious, boring, mainstream, regulated investments managed by a large banks.
It's also worth noting that there's still a long way down. If losses at $575 seemed insufferable, I'd personally take those losses and not risk $380 or $260 or worse, because the risk is there. There is absolutely no guarantee this is the bottom.
But there's certainly no guarantee this is the top, either.

This is money flowing to the early adopters.
Unless by "money", you meant "bitcoin"?

You can't have it both ways. Most businesses won't care much about a boycott by a radical minority, the moderate majority won't care enough to boycott.
@_date: 2013-11-15 00:25:27
But it would also make it much more difficult for places like Subway to accept it as payment, which would severely affect its value as a means of payment, no?

Bitstamp is in Slovenia, but it's registered at a UK address. AML/KYC controls might flag this as a suspicious shell company setup.

Between Gox's longstanding problems, and Bitstamp's banking software problems, what's left for wire withdrawals into EU?

It is not my impression that China is the kind of jurisdiction where you can get around the rules it wants to impose by throwing technicalities in its collective face.

Bitcoin, not necessarily cryptocurrency. Remember Yahoo? Are you using it much for your web searches? Remember Napster? Do you listen to a lot of music from it?

Well, yes, but I'm more interested in people's actual experiences.
The image says "8/4 weeks or more". My impression is that people's experiences are closer to "more, tending towars never", and that the majority of those experiences are for USD. But both of those might be heavily biased: those whose payments got through have a lot less reason to comment, and the USD market is disproportionately large.
So I'd be very interested in actual experiences for all cases: SEPA EUR, wire EUR, wire USD, domestic USD... there might be significant differences. Or there might not. I don't know! That's why I'm asking.

Why can't you use Bitstamp in the UK?
Wouldn't a rent bill satisfy Mt. Gox's proof of residence requirmenet?

Bullshit. If bitcoin drops, he'll lose relative to food, heating, and housing. Even if he pays for those in bitcoin.

If I'm writing it down, why bother with a brainwallet? Why not just generate a public/private key pair and write down the private key?
This is exactly the kind of thing that trips me up, what are the advantages and disadvantages of the various approaches, and when does one approach degenerate into merely an inferior and/or more complex variant of another approach?

On Bitstamp, is it just the deposits that are delayed? What about wire withdrawals?
@_date: 2013-11-15 13:23:05


Except the validated address is linked to your identity, so you can be asked how you got the "dirty" coins. Got them from an validated address? kthanx, we'll ask them. Got them from an unvalidated address? How come? Do you know the sender? Why did you accept them? Are you hiding something?
That would be a huge incentive for the average user to only send "clean" coins from their validated address, therefore a huge incentive to only acknowledge "clean" coins as payment.

They require proof of residence as well.

Do I understand correctly that the entire Electrum wallet can be recreated from just the seed?
I.e. should you lose the data on your offline PC, you can still access your funds if you know the seed?
