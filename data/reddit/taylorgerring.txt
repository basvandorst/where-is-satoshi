Something like the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines]( can be useful to keep in mind for general UI development.
Since "handicap accessible" can mean a lot of things depending on the context, is there a specific disability that you feel requires special attention?

From a technical perspective, it could be argued that Ethereum is a superset of what Bitcoin is... however, technical merits are not the only driver in usage nor success (Betamax, anyone?)
Specifically, Bitcoin is succeeding in many places that Ethereum doesn't necessarily wish to participate, especially in relation to money, politics, and end-user education. Instead of those issues, the Ethereum dev team is focused on providing the tools and resources that will increase adoption amongst developers, since they are the ones that will build the next generation of decentralised apps.
The truth is that distributed consensus systems will likely have several niches to fill. Bitcoin has done an excellent job of starting the conversation about the nature of money. Ethereum is more focused on building a "web 3" layer of protocols designed for a modern internet.  Still being relatively early for this category of software, it's difficult to predict what markets will be born out of this new class of technology or how many may eventually succeed, but I think we're unlikely to see a single blockchain meet all the needs of every category of distributed consensus.

Part of the issue is with hardcoded fees that we've had to live with. There's been a long-standing discussion about the improvements that floating fees ([supposedly coming in Bitcoin Core 0.10]( could offer. At [Hive]( we went so far as to sketch out some UI prototypes for our Mac client whenever BitcoinJ has the appropriate code available.
In theory, once the majority of wallets move to a "floating fee" model, the market may very well settle on a lower average transaction fee in the near term if you're willing to wait an extra block or so. Remittances is a keen area which could benefit from almost-zero fees in exchange for slightly slower processing time.

The travel business is currently a volume business--that is, there is relatively little profit per trip.
From that standpoint, they should offer a Bitcoin payment discount to its customers, thereby being able to beat its competitors prices and attract more customers (and volume). Because the savings would be passed onto the customer, there should be no impact to their profit margin, yet potential customers have a financial incentive for choosing Expedia over other travel agents.

As I understand it, different opcodes from the EVM will require different "gas" to run. For example, adding two numbers will require less gas than storing data in the blockchain. When you want to execute a contract, you must send a transaction to the contract containing sufficient ether to cover the cost of the gas at some price wei per gas. In effect, this allows a market rate to be determined by what miners are willing to execute at that price.
Some more detail here:

Many of the app ideas above might be bettered suited to run as smart contracts, since the particular needs of each idea can be vastly different.
However, as human turking is best done around "computer hard, human easy" tasks, it could be really interesting if the responses were cryptographically signed so as to make them suitable input for oracles to feed smart contracts.
@_date: 2015-01-12 15:11:58
Hence the need for oracles.
Given sufficient human input from a turking system ("prove this task was completed with a digital photo"), automation could take care of the supplementary cryptographic proof and determining the "correct" answer, thus distilling the human input into a digital one.

My point was that it takes quite a bit of knowledge about Bitcoin transaction scripts to implement "refund to previous outputs"—precisely the opposite of what you suggested.
@_date: 2013-09-03 23:08:36
The way I accomplish it on [paythru.to]( is to hold the coins at a temporary address (which you can see!) and send them an email inviting them to publish their own Bitcoin address (which you can see!). Once they do, the coins are forwarded to their new address and we update our database.
I'm currently testing payment notifications and auto-refunds (in case the person never claims their bitcoins). If you have any feedback on what you do or don't like, I'd love to hear it.
@_date: 2013-11-04 04:11:09


I don't understand why refund-to-sender is looked at as "evil", but services that send from shared wallets that the user doesn't control is given a pass.
Why is the practice of shared sending addresses even tolerated when you know you don't have control of how or when the coins are sent.
@_date: 2013-10-04 12:55:44

I attempt to refund the transaction to the source address after 2016 blocks (configurable). Because of this, it's advisable to send from an address you directly control, not a shared wallet.
If a better mechanism is built into the protocol, I'd certainly prefer a user-defined refund address.
@_date: 2013-11-04 05:48:11


Is this always desirable?


No, off chain transactions is unrelated to shared sending addresses.


Sometimes. But this is no different than declaring you own some specific address—which you could actually receive payments to.


Shared sending wallets strip control away from the user. Blockchain.info provides convenient transactions in a web wallet WITHOUT shared sending.


Shared sending wallets often re-use addresses.

The amount of coins the service holds is minimal, since it encourages people publishing their own addresses. Even then, we return funds in less than 2 weeks.
*I would not recommend using this to transfer large sums of money, but it can be great to pay your friend back for a round of beers.*
In terms of account hijacking, it's something I've thought a lot about, but there's not much I can do aside from allowing users to "lock/verify" the address by signing a message with it. I'd love to implement that piece, but only if people want to use the service.

It might be nice if you could designate a certain USD/EUR balance to maintain. i.e. if it drops below $100 USD, sell enough Bitcoin to reup balance to $300. Or something like that.
I don't know that the funds are necessarily spendable after 1 confirmation, because someone else issues the card itself, and I imagine there might be a "next business day" lag. I guess I'll find out later today.

1. Bitcoin is new technology, just like the internet was new technology 20 years ago

Nor does Bitcoin guarantee that the outputs are spendable. Are those transactions "evil"?


Right, they're terrible ones. I'm of the opinion that you should control the keys to your bitcoins. If you don't own the keys to your balance, you don't really own them.

My thought was that *if* there's a ticker on the sidebar, there's no reason to make incessant posts about the rate (furthermore, we could outright reject them). And since it's smoothed out to a 24h weighted average, we avoid most of the inter-day volatility.

If you've already got coins and want to send them to someone without having to sign up for an account or first explain what Bitcoin is, I've been building 
It attempts to look up the Bitcoin address for a particular email or website and simply report it to you, the user. If no address can be found, the site will generate a temporary address and email the person letting them know what Bitcoin is, how to claim their funds, and how to publish their own wallet address.
It effectively acts as a public directory with [currently in testing] email notifications (i.e. "You received 0.02 bitcoins!"). Additionally, I'm extremely interested in implementing [BIP 0015 via Namecoin]( if I can manage to get ahold of the Bitcoin developers.
