Because it is extraordinarily obvious you think BTC is like a fortune 500 company (google, FB, walmart, mcd, amazon, wells fargo, JP Morgan chase, etc.) that is going to go up, up, up, and up over time. Got news for you nobody uses bitcoin and never will. 
It'll be under $1500 within 3 years but I wouldn't be surprised if people are dumb enough to bid it to new highs (although I sure wouldn't want to be a buyer over 10k). How about that

Their coins will either be worth 1-6 billion.....or my guess under 100 million.
Enormous fools for not selling at +15,000 for over $1 billion. And then crashes to 3k/btc. And then they got a 2nd opportunity to sell over +13,000/btc and probably were too dumb/greedy.

Sure, but you do see the part where I said they might be worth 1-6 billion which allows me to still be right even if BTC goes to 90k lol. 
1 billion it was at least 15,000/btc
6 billion means it'd be 90,000/btc.
So pretty much either way it goes my comment will still be correct in 3 years.

I believe over time they'll be worthless. That's 20 years out or longer. In 3 years I'd guess the value of BTC to be anywhere between $500 and $90,000/btc. And nobody knows as it is extremely volatile. It can be back to $3000 by next month or up to 15k.
Concerning the value of these twins coins (which at their high was \~$1 billion) I think they'll drop in value to $100,000,000 or under which would put BTC at $1500 or below within 3 years. 
You could be wrong, I could be wrong, nobody knows as it is just a highly volatile piece of junk that people trade. Will they be dumb enough to continue to have buyers at 10k+ for a coin that nobody uses in the real world? All the way to 100k? Very unlikely but it is possible people are that dumb.
