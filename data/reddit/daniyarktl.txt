~300-500$ of difference in prices for few days is the huge reaction of the situation. Market is too risky right now, from conspirilogy point of view (which is very popular in this subreddit) maybe some chinese whales have inside news and still waiting for negative response of markets. Maybe that's why we still have that difference in price.

It is your subjective point of view, what is big and what is small drop. Since, more people are being involved in Bitcoin, since liquidity and volumes increased, since volatility decreased significantly from 2011-2013 a drop of 6-12% is quite big, in my opinion. Also, such drop is much bigger for margin traders. You have possible bought BTC for sub$1000, but for those who bought it for $4000-5000 such drops and news are huge. Don't be surprised, hodlers.

Yes, it is climbing up. Key words here are "if proven correct". Everybody is waiting for a big news, it could be either porsitive or negative. But WSJ article from their Chinese reporter is huge enough for those who can't handle a risk of another drop of 10-15%. Shortly saying, FUD is significant right now. Just let's wait for some news, hope it is gonna be positive.
