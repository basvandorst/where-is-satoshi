If you're in Vancouver, there's a bitcoin ATM down by waves coffee.
You can only do $3000 a day though. (or is it a week, month, or year?)
@_date: 2014-01-13 04:58:50
I can't use Gyft in Canada =(
Thanks for your suggestion though! 
@_date: 2014-01-05 06:55:11
Or maybe they could talk about mining, but state the facts about  difficulty nowadays, and try to discourage mining. 
@_date: 2014-01-09 05:59:18
I feel stupid for asking this, but what is it?
@_date: 2014-01-28 19:22:03
It's easier for normal people to relate with. 
It's almost like a credit card, or a debit card, and people understand how to use those.

I've been trying to set up p2pool, but I've had some issues with it.
Can anyone link me to the easiest way to connect to p2pool?
Only a jalapeno here, but I guess every bit helps! 
@_date: 2014-03-05 05:07:42
What are the exact measurements for each size?
Specifically size S, and M.
@_date: 2014-01-03 03:09:10
Can vouch for their service
The last time I used their website, I used a credit card. Didn't have enough bitcoins =)
@_date: 2014-01-28 19:10:14
Because I thought I lifted, 
But I don't actually lift.

Actually, you can have more than 8 connections.
Just forward port 8333!
 Currently I'm connected to 58 other nodes.
@_date: 2014-01-07 05:39:11
Because they are a scam
@_date: 2014-01-23 19:39:27
I thought they halted them for a while. I'm still trying to get one, are they back? 
@_date: 2014-02-25 04:51:39

I still don't get what you mean when p2pool.org is a scam... How?

A quick Google search didn't turn any thing up, so I'm quite curious too

@_date: 2013-11-27 00:02:55
What's their website?
@_date: 2013-04-17 00:49:27
When a single Bitcoin was around $265, we were at over $1300 worth of USD.
This is with 4 daily miners.
a 6850 at 140 mHashes/s
an OC'd 6870 at 280
a 7850 at 350 
an OC'd 7870 Ghz at 400+
Average mining time per card per day is around 15 hours.
@_date: 2013-12-13 00:49:21
I was thinking 0.01 and the rest 0.009?
I'm sorry I sound cheap, but that's what I think the value of them are.
Of course, I'm Asian, so uh.. I'm.. cheaper...
@_date: 2013-05-14 00:20:27
I was thinking -- if I'm mining for a pool, don't the shares I submit go towards the pool operator? Which then translates to the pool operator mining on his client, etc.
@_date: 2013-05-14 00:23:32
Thanks for explaining! 
What I'm seeing from [this link]( is that the highest chart plot is in France, which happens to be where Slush's pool is based in, 
But I thought other pools and miners would show up some other places too?
@_date: 2013-05-19 05:34:54
Woot! Thanks! 
Side note: Why are you on a 6 day old thread..
@_date: 2013-06-29 02:49:08
I have my port 8332TCP forwarded, and I'm connecting to 55+ people at a time. I'm not sure if it's better to do that though, but I'm hoping by having more connections, I'll become a "better" node!
Edit: oops, mistyped the port. It's supposed to be 8333
@_date: 2013-12-31 09:12:01
It's a pretty bad ad IMO
@_date: 2013-06-29 04:43:08
Sorry about that. 
Yes, it's 8333 but I typed it incorrectly. 
@_date: 2013-06-01 05:31:12
Probably less that that..

@_date: 2013-05-13 02:02:23
Yep! I knew about it, but unfortunately, when I tried to buy 5 game combos for my friends, the guy at steambits said that Steam rejected my request.... etc etc.
I technically could buy all 10 games one by one, but that way, I'm losing $10 each game.

Ah. That make sense.
I assume it's hand wash then?
@_date: 2013-05-21 03:55:25
Nope, it was through the payment platform.
@_date: 2013-12-02 03:00:37
It's gone - mirror?
@_date: 2013-06-26 19:36:32
We actually found a block once with only 385 Mhashes

I'm 15, and I use it every now and then..
Although I must admit it's insanely hard to convert bitcoin into real money or vice versa
@_date: 2013-05-13 01:12:29
Or parents.
Parents in my household are more powerful than all banks, governments, and law enforcement combined.
@_date: 2013-05-13 01:38:35
I have a 6870 and my friends have some different ones
a 6850 at 140 mHashes/s
an OC'd 6870 at 280
a 7850 at 350
an OC'd 7870 Ghz at 400+
and a few more 
Average mining time per card per day is around 15 hours.
We have around $1300 right now.
And yes, I've ordered a BFL Jalapeno with Bitcoins when it was still less than $200.
We're planning to order another one once the first one comes.
@_date: 2013-05-30 04:52:05
If you don't pay fees, the transaction will still occur, although it  may take a few days to conduct.
I recently transferred money without a transfer fee and it took more than 6 days. Of course -- that's the extreme end.
@_date: 2013-05-13 22:55:31
I'm not sure if that was supposed to be a joke, but I'm laughing :)

Although this isn't the same thread, I recall somewhere in Bitcointalk forums someone said they found an exploit in SD. It was promptly deleted, by who knows.

Although possibly not very related, How exactly do I buy from ASICminer? All I see is a bitcoin thread, and no official site. Sorry if I'm a bit dumb on this topic, but I'm looking possibly buy from them. Thanks!

China is a common country in the world. It's the equivalent of "States" in Jones.
@_date: 2013-05-13 01:53:48
Might not be too late, it looks like a large majority of ASICs haven't came yet. *Yet*.
I'd start mining ASAP, because once the difficulty rises, there's no going back.
Better to make some money now..right? Plus, you have a 7950, so that's going to get you some big cash.
@_date: 2013-11-22 22:28:16

Sorry for not making myself understandable.
I'm saying bitcoin a great thing because one who cannot get a job (under constraints my parents put upon me), or one who cannot spend his own money(again, my parents don't let me use my own money).
@_date: 2013-05-13 00:36:43

@_date: 2013-12-17 06:42:16
The company behind all the Bitcion ATMs in Canada is Bitcoiniacs, some shop in Vancouver. Currently there is only one in Vancouver, but I asked the guy via email, and he said that there will be one in Calgary early to mid January.

The fact that 100 billion coins are pre-printed and in the hands of the founding company, and that it's CENTRALIZED, PROPRIETARY AND CLOSED SOURCE should be a big enough red flag for everybody to not touch Ripple. Nuff said.
Not to mention every single Ripple nodes is controlled by a private for profit company. It is centralized, like a bank or PayPal. Not a decentralized currency.
Remember, Ripple’s investors are connected to big name banks and payment services like PayPal. They want Ripple, a closed and centralized alternative, to kill Bitcoin – and they support Ripple undisputably lying about key concepts right in the homepage.

Although personally, I'm using the Bitcoin-QT client
@_date: 2013-06-16 18:21:12
Not much.
Back in January we were earning $5 a day, now we're at $1~
