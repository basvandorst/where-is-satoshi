Depends on the country, bitcoin.de is pretty good for Germany.

They don't need new laws to tax your capital gains from cryptocurrencies, it's simply income in many jurisdictions.
If you build a business with money you earned before and which therefore was already taxed, you're not getting off free either.

I'm just curious, how does it work with the confirmations? For example if you want to pay your groceries with bitcoin, do you have to wait until the confirmations are in? 
For me even with increased fees it takes at least ten minutes for the first confirmation whereas something like Google pay goes through in seconds.
Am I doing something wrong?
@_date: 2019-07-31 05:47:13
For example if you're an otherwise poor college student and need a new laptop or some groceries.

I mean he's most likely already loaded with dollars and other assets, he doesn't have to bother with putting any effort into learning something new and investing in it.
He should probably choose another job, though, because he's quite bad at what he does now.

5Ge is simply marketing to make people feel like they are paying a lot for something special, while in fact they don't.
5G without E is the real deal but doesn't really exist yet.
@_date: 2019-11-28 07:08:22
5Ge is just rebranded LTE.
@_date: 2019-11-28 10:20:57
5G **e ** is in fact fake 5G.

How can a bank not let you buy bitcoin? Do they block transactions to known crypto exchanges?

If you plan on holding for the long term and are confident to hold through turbulences, FUD and all the other stuff, I think it will be a good investment. 
Blockchain technology and cryptocurrencies are, on a larger timeframe, still in their infancy. I sometimes feel like I'm the only one who uses his smartphone for contactless payments and it's just Google Pay and therefore rather basic. People still use cash most of the time. There's a lot of potential in digitalization. 
I see the 2017 bitcoin bubble as comparable to the dotcom bubble in the early 2000s, a new technology came around, it was overhyped at a time when it wasn't fully ready yet but in the long term it went through the roof. 
But be aware that there is risk in every investment, never invest more than you can afford to lose.

Store of value, people will soon have to pay negative interest on money in their bank account.

Especially because it has more meme potential than security.

Remember how many people laughed about the disappointing bakkt start? It even caused a dip in price.
Now it seems to do absolutely fine. Many people like to observe before they invest.
@_date: 2019-11-10 16:57:00
Why is that guy so obsessed with bitcoin? If it really has no value, as he thinks, he wouldn't need to worry about it?
@_date: 2019-11-24 16:57:38
Depends on whether they are in it for the long term (years) and local tax laws. Some countries tax crypto profits at your personal income rate (up to 50%) but don't tax them at all after holding for at least one year. Buying in January and selling in June isn't possible for everyone.
@_date: 2019-11-27 18:15:10
Vandalism isn't cool, something like that does not advertise bitcoin.

Many people even struggle with using their PC, they'll lose their coins. 
Banks offering wallet services in the standard online banking will help mainstream adoption.

Say if Trump harms the dollar and the economy which boosts bitcoin and he then loses the election to someone who endorses bitcoin, this would be a massive continued boost.
@_date: 2019-08-15 11:06:51
I did completely fine by not checking bitcoin at all between March 2018 and June 2019, only setting an email alert for like 9000€ because I knew it would rise again. Instead I completely focused on university.
To be honest checking the price and news is interesting and fascinating but it's rather stressful. I'm in it for the long game anyway so if some of you feel the same you could consider setting min/max alerts and come back whenever you like.
@_date: 2019-08-07 14:27:29
It was the $12,000 mark that triggered sell orders
@_date: 2019-08-15 17:50:45
I absolutely agree, I'm usually a bitcoin HODLer but I did sell some BTC in 2013 to buy a laptop for university and I did not once regret it.
It's what I needed the most at that time and it has helped me to succeed with my career, I'm still using it now.
@_date: 2019-08-06 07:51:36
Ideally, exchanges would store like 98% of their customers bitcoin in cold storage and only operate with an amount that could potentially be replaced in case of a breach.
This could delay sending your btc to external wallets but it's better than loss.
@_date: 2019-08-02 18:19:45
Don't they charge massive premiums?
@_date: 2019-10-30 18:04:23
Unless there's reason to believe that he actually cannot access it anymore because otherwise someone could be held indefinitely.
@_date: 2019-08-06 07:29:06
Could be that many of those 2k accounts are exchanges and people trade on there without bitcoin ever physically moving, the exchanges just shift numbers around between their customers accounts.
That's potentially an issue, though, because you don't "physically" own your coins.
@_date: 2019-08-06 10:08:38
Do you have a source on that? [I've heard of 2020](
October is only the submission deadline for the rehabilitation plan.

For me it took them a week to remove 2FA from an old wallet where I did not have access to the old email anymore.
Maybe you can write them your ticket ID on [Twitter]( and ask them to look at it within a reasonable time frame.

So if it goes up and he makes profit, you get a commission.
What if it goes down? Do you reimburse him?
Those are important questions.
Money is serious business, yes, even within the family, maybe especially within the family because it can cause big trouble.
Talk to him about bitcoin but don't hide the risks, he then can make a decision himself.

Maybe write them an Einschreiben to their post address.

The safest option would be to wait for long term gains next year, that way you can't miss your buying opportunity if it hovers at this level instead of dropping.
@_date: 2019-10-30 19:39:28
Without protection by the law it would be useless, because anyone could take your property and you couldn't do anything about it if that person is stronger. The law of the strongest is a natural law which got replaced by our current law and that's good.
I see no reason why someone who makes money from illegal activities should be able to keep it, no matter if it's fiat, crypto, Gold or whatever.
Example: What if someone's illegal activities get someone killed. He gets arrested, sentenced to life in prison, his illegal profits are confiscated and distributed to the families of the person who died. 
Would that be okay? I think it would.

It's completely normal for courts to confiscate money that they think comes from illegal activities.
Doesn't matter whether it's fiat, gold, crypto or whether a person already bought a car with it.

Because they don't understand it, the average person already struggles with remembering their Facebook password and doing online banking, they'd lose their funds within weeks unless they get hacked beforehand because they click on everything on the internet.

The real guy, if it even is a single person, probably just laughs about all that drama and stays hidden forever because it's the only way to live a peaceful life.
There is not a single reason to reveal yourself, Bitcoin works, it doesn't need help from the creator.

I'm so ready for the media induced halving pump in early 2020. I expect a correction afterwards, though.
@_date: 2019-08-07 15:05:10
Yes, of course. 
It's just a coincidence that GBP 10,000 were also $12,000.
The bitcoin price does not care much about milestones in GBP, it's affected by global trading which is oriented on the US-Dollar.

You do need to factor in the cost of the solar panels, though.
Also: [opportunity cost]( as you could habe used the solar electricity otherwise, like selling it to the government.
@_date: 2019-10-28 12:44:26
When everyone seems to panic, is in bad mood and the media once again proclaims the imminent death of bitcoin.
That's a nice dip.
@_date: 2019-10-30 19:26:00
Property itself would not exist without the law, so it's natural that the law can also take it away in certain cases.
There is no reason why bitcoin should enjoy legal immunity. It's a store of value like anything else.

Or it's like the discussion in March 2017 about the $1000 level.

I think it's the start of a rather slow but steady uptrend into 2020.
The new decade is an important psychological event for technological advance. When I look around I see mostly people incapable of doing even the most basic digital tasks like paying with their phones but this is about to change because it has to.
Negative interest rates for bank accounts are coming in germany and at the same time a law requiring banks from separating crypto and their normal business will be removed in January 2020.
A lot is about to happen and I'm excited about it.

Using it. I pay with Bitcoin when I have the opportunity. Online services often offer bitcoin payments nowadays.

It might not be ideal but it works.
Unless people really know what they are doing, they could just as likely lose or accidently destroy a trezor or ledger as someone hacking their blockchain account.
@_date: 2019-12-19 20:19:26
Let's say a non-exchange wallet like standard blockchain.com.
@_date: 2019-12-16 14:49:27
Germany just legalized it for banks to offer crypto services directly to customers starting January 2020. 
I know many people in the Crypto scene dislike banks but to be honest, it's probably inevitable for mass adoption.
Then you can buy crypto right from your online banking and hold it your depot or, (better idea) transfer it to you own wallet.
The main issue right now is taxes, if you buy bitcoin, it increases in value and you then spend it, you create a taxable event (depending on jurisdiction).
Germany has the nice exception that it is not a taxable event as long as you hodl for at least a year. Makes spending easy after you "age" your BTC like a fine wine.
