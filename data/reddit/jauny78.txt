that's a good comment. Also yes, this happens, people kill themselves over things *they missed out* even if never had.  
This seems crazy. I mean I went through bankruptcy and went from low end millionnaire to NOTHING. This is hard. But missing out of things? It happens very often, you can't feel bad about it.
There is a notorious story of the dude who created Victoria's Secrets and sold the company for pretty cheap. Once it was valued way higher he ended up killing himself.

I sent a package to my girlfriend who lives in Buenos Aires for xmas.
It's been stuck at the customs since jan 2nd now... and she has no way of contacting or retrieving the package...
This is sad for this country; When I went there, there seemed to be a pretty strong middle class, way more rich than other south american countries such as colombia, etc. but still I don't understand why a communist gvt like this one is still in place and voted for again and again.
