I'm having a hard time deciding which is funnier, the thread or comments here.

is what forum.{1}.org should be, most of the time, it seems.  A lot of it, I think, comes from the fact that highly specialized subreddits tend to be a lot smaller, and also only a redditor would think to check on reddit for bitcoin help; your normal person would use the google, and bam, "whores dont know shit".

You should spend your bitcoins on goods and services, not just alternative bargin tokens.

(I recommend using multiple exchanges and not keeping any significant amount of money in any of them.  If you wouldn't be okay with it falling out of your pocket on the street, probably not the best plan to store it in someone else's hands unless you are certain you trust them.)

Until this post, I didn't consider the chance it *isn't* Mount Gox.

As I said, neither do I, but you have to understand where other people might be coming from - if Facebook's initial niche was drug dealers and their clients, do you think it'd be as widely used now?

It's stuff like this that really won't help legitimize Bitcoin as a currency.  Don't get my wrong, I have nothing against Anonymous (as my other online activity shows,) but there are a lot of people who view them as nothing more than a terrorist organization, and this just cements opinions that Bitcoin is the currency of criminals and terrorists.
pre-edit: (I use Bitcoin and help Anonymous, so don't think that way about Bitcoin, but know a fair number of people who write it off because of the connotations around it.)

It does - even despite people not using reddiquette/bitching about people not using it all the time, most comments and posts that are rubbish, I never see, and the good ones are the most prominent.

I did have a long reply typed out but then I realized most of it was just Internet dickery so:
You're halfway right.  Neither of us can prevent someone from using it, but we CAN encourage its use elsewhere.  I'm not saying that Anonymous doesn't attract a few more users - it does.  What it also might do is dissuade legitimate people from accepting the currency, if the market consists entirely of illicit payments.

A mountain of [GOx]( seems vaguely terrifying...

Made me laugh.  It's funny how everyone simultaneously bitches that bitcoins will never be taken seriously as a currency if they remain so volatile... but can't they be just a bit more volatile so we can gamble with them?

It was a nice article, but it didn't really explain how Bitcoin would reveal financial regulation to be favoritism.
@_date: 2013-04-27 23:14:30
Cool!  Yeah, it was a really well written article, but it lacked that conclusion to really bring it all together.  It's easy to infer from the rest of the post, but explicit is better than implicit, especially if your title is explicit.

Don't think of tipping as paying extra, but as not tipping as giving yourself a discount for shitty service, I think is what he's saying.

I think it's funny how common those terms are in people's speech, but how uncommon knowing what they mean is.
