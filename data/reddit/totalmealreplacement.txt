If you're looking to grow your money with your storage system, there is no better place than with my system :)

Hello sir yes. The money is pooled in the reserve. The money is then loaned out to others and earns interest on lines of credit and invested for the bank to make a profit. I am working to take away the hassle of regular banks such as overdraft fees and lengthy transfers. Any more questions?

Im so glad you asked! Yes i love real estate. That would be the primary method of raising money i am currently looking at.
Bank is international! But is founded in the US. Dont yell at me! I havent looked into all the laws yet. So i dont have an answer to that question yet.
Any country I can administer product is where i will sell them.
I am crowdfunding currently, seeking venture capitalists and angel investors. I am looking to start the bank with at least 1m in reserve. I will offer similar rates as banks offer on mortgages. And I trust that whoever takes out a loan can figure out a way to not get screwed on their mortgage. 
Lets make a new card type! If you guys want that then lets do it! I have no problems with visa and mastercard but im also a serial slayer of ideas and am open if thats what the people want.
Your funds are secure. If you can trust them (other banks), you can trust me.

Good question! We are developing the CENTRALIZED (sorry!) system of transfer. PHYSICAL LOCATIONS*** boom fireworks, no more money orders and online deals. A place that can be trusted by HIRED BANKERS to handle your money UNDER THE LAW. No one gets in trouble if they steal your money on localbitcoins currently. Lets change this! The bank, im telling you, is gonna be your best friend.

What do you suggest?
@_date: 2016-07-18 03:10:50
Do you pay yourself interest or loan to yourself, or offer yourself bonds or other ways to grow your money?
@_date: 2016-07-18 02:33:04
Yes proof of reserves will be fine... I dont see why this would be a lie but okay! You own all rights to your money. You have the keys. The job and business of the bank (of cryptocurrency) is to incentivise you to bank with us unlike all these wallets out here who provide no reason to store with them. And our business is loaning out a percentage of the money and investing.

And its not just my hands in the money, this is a hired team of guys with a conscious and people who are also for the people.
@_date: 2016-07-18 04:25:44
On the way, sir. Thank you.

I dont see why not honestly. At the end of the day the goal is not to control the money but to provide the service. To provide the service i need to control at least 10% of the money.

It works just like any other bank with any other currency.
@_date: 2016-07-18 04:01:28
I havent found one.
@_date: 2016-07-18 00:13:00
Lol your rate of return would be higher than a bank holding your local currency. Kind of like back in the old days when having a savings account actually meant something.

I went to a seminar last year and they explained how banks make money. I'm not going to get into every detail but if Fractional banking is investing my clients money into lines of credit, real estate and bonds then thats what this is. Thats how banks make money.
@_date: 2016-07-18 03:08:03
This is the first bank of bitcoin. I understand your concerns everyone. Just know that i love you all! I wouldnt want you to lose your money. I work based on integrity and I cant wait to prove it to you!
@_date: 2016-07-18 02:49:07
You're not very nice.
@_date: 2016-07-18 02:29:15
Trying to eliminate overdraft fees and other inconvenient things that regular banks have. Thats a big point of this. We make money by giving out credit and receiving interest. I am also TRYING to incorporate an INTERNATIONAL EXCHANGE SERVICE where you can use bitcoin to your local currency for any transaction. You travel to France with 10k in bitcoin you bought with USD, you can buy stuff in France with your card. Savings interest is nothing spectacular... This is a business mind you. Wouldnt make much sense to give out 10% of interest but if you have 500k worth of currency invested with me, it should be at least enough to pay the bills. Know what I'm saying? Savings accounts in regular banks used to be that way! I'm bringing that back.
@_date: 2016-07-18 04:13:29
You obviously dont know how banks work hunny bun!
@_date: 2016-07-18 05:00:05
I understand your concern. You do not need to worry about me and my system.
