I don't know much about it, but I've definitely heard of Bitcoin mining.  You contribute CPU cycles to the system, facilitating other transactions, and create more bitcoins by doing so.  Not sure on the details.

you realize that you can use bitcoins to buy US dollars, right?  Those are generally considered useful.

there are plenty of good ways to store a number this way.  One is, in a publicly known and easily reversible way turn your secret code into an essentially random polynomial of degree n.  So knowing the polynomial gives you the secret code, and vice versa, but the polynomial itself is just as hard to guess as the original secret code.  This isn't hard to do.  
Now the degree of this polynomial is n, so you need exactly n+1 points on the curve to figure out what the polynomial is.  For example, if I tell you that for a quadratic polynomial p, p(0)=54 and p(4)=9 and p(-2)=11, then you can figure out what p is.  You probably learned how in high school.  But with just two of those points, there is no way to figure out what the polynomial is.  
Now you make some number of slips of paper, one says p(0)=5, one says p(1)=78882, one says p(2)=-84.3, another one says what p(3) is, and so on.  You make whatever number of these that you want. With any n+1 of the slips, the you can figure out what the polynomial is.  But with n or fewer slips, you have no idea.  
So for a 2/3 system, just encode your bitcoins as a linear equation f(x)=ax+b.  Then you memorize f(0), you tell the bank what f(1) is, and you put f(2) in a vault.  With any two of those, figuring out what line passes through the two points (and thus figuring out what your bitcoin code is) is easy, but with just one it can't be done.

Thanks for the info, I'd always wondered how that works. I tried to set this up in 2010, but I left a program running for a week and nothing happened. I wasn't interested enough to keep at it or figure out what I was doing wrong, and it sounded too good to be true anyway.  If I had known what I was doing, would I be rich now?

That sounds like it will be very limiting in the long term.  Is there a way to raise it eventually, our introduce smaller units? Like bitcents

If the bank fails, a 2/3 system is safe. Two systems have to fall simultaneously to lose access.

2/3 means you need two, any two, of the the keys to access the system. A fire which does not kill you and does not hit both your house and the bank simultaneously is exactly what his system is for

There is an exchange which will buy bitcoins, paying you in dollars, though in theory it could disappear at any moment.  
@_date: 2013-04-03 19:48:41
It's not limited, you can make more.

Bitcoins buy dollars buy food.  Hence, bitcoins buy useful things.
