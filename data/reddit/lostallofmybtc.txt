Thank you so much! Words simply cannot express how grateful that I am to you and am in your debt. Please let me know what I can do to repay you for returning the coins.

Yes, that is my address. It was not generated with brainwallet. It was generated with blockchain.info. I'm trying to figure out how to sign a message there.

I didn't use bitaddress.org, though it appears that I should have. I used the random button on brainwallet.org.

First of all, thank you for all of your assistance.
I found the sign message area for that address. A popup generates and has a text box inside. When I populate the text box with a message and click sign message, it generates a new field that is called "signature" and has what looks kind of like a private key in that field. From there it does nothing. I was able to send a transaction from that address with a message in it earlier though.

I've read the information here for months, but never had a reason to register to comment. It appears that i've discovered what has happened. All 18 of my addresses were created by using the "random" button on brainwallet.org. Well, apparently the "random" button isn't so random and someone was able to recreate my private keys and move the coins to their own accounts.

My private keys were inside of a truecrypt encrypted spreadsheet. I had three other BTC private keys that were not generated by brainwallet.org inside the same spreadsheet. The three "non brainwallet.org" keys are fine and have not been compromised. Only the brainwallet.org private keys that were generated with the random button have been compromised. I'm completely taking the blame on this as it was all my fault, hopefully someone else will read this and not make the same stupid mistake that I did.

Dear sir,
I was directed to this thread by another member of Reddit.
I'm hoping that maybe you may have been the person who discovered my private keys.
Last night I had 18 of my addresses emptied out by these two addresses:
1cvvnsUpaAvatvfDKgixRYvSdGLDfA4CA and 18rmY7jHdk4mrdMN46ERbFXm8YvM6ZDFo3
Each of the 18 private keys were created by using the "random" button on brainwallet.org.

I'm not here to, nor have I in this thread solicited any tips. I simply woke up this morning and noticed that BTC had been moved from 18 of my addresses without my knowledge. Have a nice day.
