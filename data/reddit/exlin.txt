That or heard someone saying what happened in such situation.

5-10% fee seems to be pretty standard on ATM machines. Handling cash can be expensive and they need to make a profit.
@_date: 2018-01-31 12:57:55
In Finland, to my understanding, it depends on value. Sell couple hundreds of euros with high enough fee and you don't need to wait for confirmation but if you try to sell thousands worth of coins, it will want to see a confirmation.

In my country gift tax is paid by the person receiving it, not giving. And also most donations would go below 5000€ minimum per person to be a taxable gift.

I think something like this were tried in Sweden related to Bittorrent, 
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:03:31
Yes, although as I also chipped in this could create interesting scenarios. As I'm expecting that receiver takes care of gift tax if applicable and if in US expectation is that person giving donation takes care of tax, will nobody pay the tax?

If you are from UK, I would recommend Bitstamp.

Satoshi confirms that it's not him.

Perhaps we should see these as blockchain inc value rising instead of bitcoins. Afterall it sounds like they purchased existing bitcoin company.

In electrum wallets only provides the information about incoming transactions (so you don't need to sync whole blockchain). Feel free to try different servers, as always its good to have keys (or seed) backed up. That allows you to try restoring wallet and its funds on other machines.

I were in understanding that localbitcoins only take a fee if you use their escrow service. But if both sides has confirmed that everything went ok before paypal reversal there probably isn't much where they can help you out.
@_date: 2014-02-13 10:54:46
That is true, however due to pressure in social media bank took it down. I think it is more significant that now they have great article posted.

Don't know how long that page has existed, but if speculated i guess that iphone could suggest something.

I mailed to security@ and got bans lifted within 1-2 days. I stated that why i didn't consider myself affected to that issue and asked them to lift the ban.

There is also  but it seems still to be in preview.

There is no minimum amount but if you want your payment be processed faster (get first confirmation within 10-20 minutes) you should pay that 0.0001. But you can also choose not to pay a fee for transaction.
The minimum transaction fee to for faster transaction is just a agreed by consensus and it has been lowered multiple times already when bitcoin price has gone up.

They have added those to couple other stations also.
However you can pay only with €-coins or credit cards; changes are they are going to lose contract with credit card companies.
Originally those machines were internet-kiosks but apparently that business is diying because everyone owns smartphone these days according to company rep.
First Bitcoin ATM in Helsinki central railway station is operated by Bittiraha.fi, established and reputable company in Finland (
@_date: 2014-02-27 15:24:11
According to interview i read earlier that is trial. Originally those machines were used for something else. I believe they are going to lose contract once CC companies notices it.

Yet again this FUD, same argument has been used before by BCH community trying to mud the waters.
@_date: 2017-11-11 20:27:57
Why BCH community feels the need to mud the waters with claims that bcash is following the original vision and thus being real bitcoin and calling Bitcoin (BTC) as Bitcoin Segwit or Segwit coin. If you believe that BCash is so great, try to convince people with the merits instead because as we all know, Bcash is the fork.
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:14:23
BCash is an altcoint and it's not nasty.

Transaction times depends on the amount, if you sell a house you may want to wait for at least 6 confirmations but if you are selling a cup of coffee 0 confirmations may be enough as risk is not that high thus probability someone cancelling it before next confirmation isn't that huge.
For scalability, there is segwit which has alreaydy been released and services and wallets are slowly starting to use it. In future there's probably going to be lightnign networks.
@_date: 2017-11-13 09:18:48
It's not about miners, it's full nodes that keep network running (and are not miners in most cases) that would feel the burden.
@_date: 2019-12-21 14:47:27
I think ATM’s require KYC in EU now as well (or was it veginning of next month).
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:52:27
"Inefficient compared to a credit card". Clearly, he didn't get the point of decentralization.
@_date: 2017-11-11 20:32:00
Yes, like segwit (active) and probably lighning networks in future. There is already an effort to scale the BTC.
@_date: 2018-02-07 14:36:44
Yes, you shouldn't give extra punishment for people who takes risk. So actually in that logic taxation in Bitcoin gains should be lower than in many other financial instruments to out-weight the risk. However it being the France, I'm not too surprised if they plan outrageous taxes.
@_date: 2017-09-14 09:49:17
In Finland capital gains tax is 30% (up to 30k€, and 34% anything above that). But you pay for profit, for you to lose 25% you have purchased coins in question relatively early.
@_date: 2017-10-21 23:21:10
I would recommend that first, you move your bitcoins to another wallet with fresh private keys to secure your Bitcoins. Then find a bcash wallet that supports the same format for private keys as mycelium uses. Import your private keys (ones that contained bitcoins at the moment of fork) for your new wallet and voila, you should now be able to see your bcash and do whatever you like with them (like send them to exchange for sale).
Edit: the reason for sending bitcoins to another wallet is that as bcash wallets are probably less secure (and online services for this are for sure).
Also you can't acquire bcash by sending coins to another webservice, if they advertise this it's a scam. However, they could potentially help out on process with private keys but i personally wouldn't trust such services enough to use them.

Basically that 101 is discount-code, i assume it's valid till 16th of april. Discount propably is from fee, not coins ;)

Even in risking the case of broken sarcasm-o-meter, it's quite common format of writing date in Europe: day.month.year.
