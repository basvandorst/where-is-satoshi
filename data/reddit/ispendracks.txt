Is there an accurate guesstimate on the numbers hen?

To be honest, is bitcoin really the best at its function? Would you call it shit just because there is a better crypto?

One thing is guaranteed in any commodity/exchange/currency: there will be coordinated manipulation.

Decent argument, but I think the underlying argument is the ease with which they can launder money with bitcoin.

You are absolutely correct. Controlling your own wealth has a value. It is certainly not zero and certainly not 90 trillion. Let’s say it’s worth 50 trillion? If we had a computer that could quantify all the factors that made it that, that would be the fundamentals. Anything with value can be explained by fundamentals. So the question is, what are those and how can we quantify them?

The underlying problem in all of bitcoin became exposed in your comment, and that is - How to evaluate crypto currency - as an inherently valuable-technology -basically fixed value commodity, or as a technology whose value is arbitrary and linked to the variable laws of supply and demand such as Facebook or any other company people are trying to quantify. 
How do you know both the inherent value AND the variable value aren’t massively overpriced for bitcoin. For one, we can extrapolate that the inherent value is unlikely to be higher than $9,000.00 because there are competitors that can function very simialrly, and are not valued at $9,000.00. This means that we evaluate bitcoin by some nominalizarion of value - it is based in supply and demand variations. No one really knows why the price is what it is, or why it’s there, for all we know the actual value of a crypto (not just bitcoin) may reach an equilibrium just like any other commodity. The value of all tvs fall on a discrete range. Same with produce, or gum. 
The ultimate point is that these commodities invoke a reflective quantification of the costs. Tvs require, solid inputs like steel and plastic, intangibles like marketing and sales, and storing. These items have the benefit of the markets equalizing over time. Same goes with peoduxe, shipping costs are going to stay fairly structured by weight, barring some massive change. 
Crypto doesn’t posses these equilibriums yet. We don’t know if the true value of producing and competing with crypto is worth more or less yet. For all we know, the true cost, from creation to possession is worth 100k a coin or is not much different than any randomly selected commodity and will be worth $50 a coin. That’s the problem.

Let’s assume that you are correct. What fundamentals justify the price that it’s at?

They can because all people that control the entities capable of making change have real power/money/good life. They allow this to happen because the alternative is the unknown. How long is the resulting depression? How violent does it get? They would rather keep the facade of the Petro-dollar financial hegemony that is undeniably outdated, simply for the comfort.

While you might eventually be correct, what fundamentals make BTC worth 10k a coin? The dream of universal adoption carries a significant inference - that realistically 1 coin will dominate the system. From what I understand, BTC is far from the best in that regard, so much like MySpace, will probably end shriveling up.
