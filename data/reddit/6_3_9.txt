It would be awesome if various cryptocurrency creators and community members came together and celebrated with a video or project.  Even something silly like a video where various crypto community member favorites lip sync sing separate lines stitched together into a full song.  It would be fun to highlight certain people, for various reasons and would really bring the community together, remembering how we got here.  If we could unite as a SPACE, rather than teams versus each other we can all achieve our dreams instead of falling into the same old pitfalls of the past.

They also have millions and billions and trillions of coins in some circumstances and late "newcomers" who are banking on these penny cryptos most often because of cheap prices. They are essentially counterfeits of bitcoin with regards to time, history, attainability, algo etc etc.  Sure they serve a purpose, but they aren't bitcoin and you can't go back in time and create more bitcoin.  You can create alts, but nothing compares to that OG chain.

Yea, so you misinterpreted what I wrote and added a lot of assertions.  There are plenty of amazing cryptos out there, and BTC is not the only valuable chain.  I literally meant what I wrote if you read it carefully.  I am certainly not a blind follower in one technology--and it's not about me anyway.  
  
As far as counterfeits...what I am referring to is the fact that while separate coins have their values and uses (which I certainly wouldn't consider counterfeit), at a certain point a fast, cheap coin is just a fast cheap coin.  In 1 year we will have more fast cheap coins and then another month, another.  You can't print CRYPTO forever and expect it all to be worth something.  Especially with inevitable multi-layer solutions.  It's not about picking a team and jumping around (unless you're trading--fine), it's about investing in the technology and everything that is BUILT and being built on top of it.  You can play it like a Rothschild if you are actually smart, but you should still have your perspective straight.

What do you mean control?  Block chain validation is based off of the consensus of ALL full nodes, not just miners.  You are mad that a certain region or certain type of person made the effort to mine a certain amount of coins?  That's all I can gather...bitcoin is hardly centralized.  Bitcoin nodes are all around the world with the majority in the USA (

you can't turn back time and create more bitcoins, no matter how many more altcoins you create.  daddy bitcoin will always be laughing at the fools.
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:07:05
I agree.  We really need to band together as a community and stay strong.  We need to push for more devs on the lightning network.  Bitcoin is like the atomic clock of crypto--it's bad for the whole sector to have this infighting.  Praise your own altcoins, for sure (I own plenty), but don't forget your daddy BTC.

Yeah so what you don't understand in all your anti-trump rage is this sentence:  
  


  
It's simply saying that your capital gains "timer" is reset when you do a crypto to crypto trade.  That date is now when your cost basis is set for the currency you traded into.

New money thinks their newest ALTCOIN can defeat Bitcoin just because it might be faster, have a more advanced use, etc.  What these newer users don't understand is the initial value of Bitcoin.  What I mean is that Bitcoin is the original authority and gatekeeper of crypto.  It's not just the "first mover advantage", it's that it is the original, authentic, trusted minting of crypto...it is the most VALID in that respect.  You can't turn back time and get easy BTC EVER.  Newbies are quick to denounce BTC in favor of making money off of less expensive coins but they fail to understand how the whole system is connected.  BTC will always have that intrinsic, original value IMO.  
  
Don't get me wrong...there are many cryptocurrencies that are great additions to the cryptosystem (MANY), and they will increase in value immensly...but to think that BTC loses any of its initial technical validity or that early adopters would just give up and sell for other coins is short-sided.  I personally think that what we are seeing now is a reinvestment of funds from bitcoin (at it's height) into other projects and cryptos to spur tech and make gains.  That's what I did and I know many others are.  There are massive gains and technical breakthroughs to be seen in 2018 in these other coins.  That being said, while newbies chase "fast digital cash" I do not think it is the end of sound money (aka fully p2p, finite).  I believe all of the coins will be connected in the end, but BTC will always be a staple.  It's the philosophical origin of the entire market.

From alts and institutional money.  The fact that you call it the dinosaur crypto is very telling of your perspective.  Why ask others if you are so doubtful?  If you live in microtime you will make micromoney.  You lack the very fundamental understanding of bitcoin's value.  More here if interested: 
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:02:04
I think the price will definitely rebound.  I think I see where you are coming from now.  I wouldn't sell right now, too risky (too late).  I took gains and diversified when BTC was high and alts were fairly low.  The timing was perfect because it allowed me to balance my earnings for the year (regarding taxes) and also prepare myself to be secure in case of a bear market in 2018.

Oh ok, no problem.  A lot of newer people seem to have the mindset that "the bestest newest" tech will be the most profitable but that's one detail of the full picture.  Yes we can make massive gains on these altcoins and yes there will be leaders of new innovations etc...but bitcoin is the big picture and it's not going to flip quickly like people fear monger because if that was the case then people wouldn't trust cryptos as a whole.  Think about it...if people keep leaving coins for the newest best, fastest etc tech then what's the point of any of it?  It's all the same, essentially.  It's not just about the tech...it's about how it was distributed, it's origins, everything as a whole...including the entire sector created by it.
@_date: 2017-12-30 06:10:59
Yeah but it's a different context.  The dollar is fiat, centralized and printed at will while Bitcoin is finite and p2p.  It's true that the dollar is the most trusted currency but I think we can see that is changing.  It's possible that a revolt could happen vs bitcoin but IMO that would be decades away.
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:41:53
Umm...decentralized currency and p2p currency.

If we don't band together now as BITCOIN, shit sellout coins with no backbone will win.  The whole crypto movement will be diverted.
@_date: 2017-12-30 08:57:02
I think that any sane person took their appropriate gains in BTC from $19k until now, and also probably reinvested some of their gains into other promising crypto projects.  
  
*That being said*, I think many will soon realize that although newer coins may offer "the newest bestest tech" with all the bells and whistles, that isn't necessarily the only value of a crypto.  I think legacy chains, mainly BTC, have intrinsic value--they are more valuable by default and newer coins could almost be perceived as more counterfeit.  I'm not saying that BTC is the only winner, just that there is value in the age, security and origins of BTC that makes it the authentic clock of crypto.  There will always be new tech and today's society demands instantaneous satisfaction but that outlook is also short-sided and not realistic with respect to the history of bitcoin and the decade of development of the entire industry surrounding it.

I could see 7k in the realm of possibility in a super bear market, but as it sits I'm not too sure we will hit even 10k.  This feels like a shakedown/correction...Christmas, taking gains...the market almost feels like it is taking a breath.  Doesn't feel like MTGOX at all...no shear panic from exchanges closing or feds shutting down a large crypto marketplace, just selling.  Who knows though.
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:00:30
To put it simply: heavy investors and most legacy holders are not apt to sell all their coin just because there are others that are faster or cheaper RIGHT NOW.  Most OG holders were smart enough to sell a % for some gains at the top and held the rest...and the fee is insignificant for those gains.  Most of them also invested for very different reasons than those who are just now entering the marketplace.
  
Yes there is a "scalability race", but it's not winner take all.  Essentially the more altcoins that are created, the more "counterfeit" they are compared to bitcoin in a sense.  You can't go back in time and create more bitcoin, even though that's exactly what many wish they were achieving with some of these alts.  Most likely they will all coexist and intermingle seamlessly in the near future.  Just because a coin is faster and cheaper right now doesn't mean it's the breadwinner--that's very short-sided thinking IMO and it makes sense why weak hands would fold right now.  
  
As far as the solutions, we know what they are.  Increase blocksize and/or lightning network (2nd layer solutions).  I think a combo of both will be enacted in the future, personally.

Really well said.  I would say the majority of posters on Reddit lack a realistic long-term perspective and are stuck chasing "the next prettiest thing".  Faster, cheaper, whatever new-coins will always get better and better every year until one is developed and all transactions are instantaneous.  You really think everyone is going to hop to the next fastest currency and ditch their funds behind, year after year then month after month?  No way!  Some will always chase gains and trade, but the community isn't just going to jump ship.  In the future all the coins will coexist and they will be valued more based on their distribution, age, security, reputation, support, algorithms etc.  Bitcoin would be just as fast as any other "coin" at this point in time.  There are communities emerging and I think some will even be regional.  You really have to think about what you are doing...put everything into perspective.

I think we are in for a slight bear market but I disagree with you, I think it will be very shallow--as in maybe a month (you are essentially dissing every single cryptocurrency, not just bitcoin, so I assume that you are talking about a broad bear crypto market).

Not true...there is a difference in installing malware that hacks your Ledger's firmware while it is connected (asking the user to update the firmware) and having general malware on your computer that will keylog and steal anything entered.  Ledger is still safe as long as it is not tampered with physically or hacked with some sort of firmware hack.  If you are being told to upgrade your firmware...look it up and make sure it is legitimate...don't just start installing things.  Either way Ledger is fixing the issues so meh.
