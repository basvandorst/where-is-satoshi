Actually, we do, apparently, still have this, just not with Gyft. It's called cardflip, and i've yet to use them.

Here's the test. If the price of bitcoin goes to $Bajillion, will you laugh? Ok, that's easy.
If the price of bitcoin goes to $0, will you laugh?
If yes to both, go all in. While you are at it, put some small percentage of that in Litecoin, and maybe an even smaller chunk in yet another, perhaps Primecoin.
Don't close your bank account, though. You might want to go back out to fiat in small chunks here and there for various things.

Exactly what I like to see. I call it the "Fuck That Bullshit, and Fuck You Mt Gox" market curve.

Yep, haven't heard a peep from them on my support request either. I forget how long it's been. Weeks, anyway.

How about tape backup!
@_date: 2014-09-21 23:23:13
They charge 10% on shipping fees too. Ab-so-lutely ridiculous. Can't wait for the demise of their monopoly.
@_date: 2014-01-10 01:42:18
Ha! Nice one.
Trouble is, staying in fiat is also kind of insane.
@_date: 2014-01-07 04:05:21
I take it you incurred a loss?
@_date: 2014-01-07 04:07:48
Yeah, I suppose it's only relatively simple. The easiest way to go straight to cold storage seems to be Coinbase's paper wallet option, though this is not accomplished offline and therefore not nearly so secure.
@_date: 2014-01-10 00:19:00
And probably the appropriate one for almost everyone.
@_date: 2014-12-12 23:18:53
I actually e-mailed their customer support about this.
"We do not require people that pay with bitcoin to be mailed out first time orders as long as the merchant itself allows the e-codes to be used in-stores or online."

The walking dead
@_date: 2015-01-16 04:18:50
And now you get both? So...
@_date: 2015-01-29 06:51:35
Yep, charge 5% and call it a day. OP's friend wouldn't have turned around at that percentage.
@_date: 2015-01-16 04:20:29
If they finish building it, we'll show up!
@_date: 2015-01-22 09:07:44
That was last year.
@_date: 2015-01-22 09:01:26
I upvoted you, because i'm taking this as reality mixed with high-grade sarcasm. aka a joke. well done
@_date: 2015-01-16 01:07:05
Super awesome.
Would have loved this back when I was knee deep in GPU rigging, oh, say, a year ago!
I still don't like eBay actually. But the convenience!
But no! OpenBazaar, we're ready when you are!
@_date: 2015-01-18 01:31:25
It would be very interesting if such a thing comes to be.
RemindMe! 40 days

Somebody downvoted you? Jesus, people. It's called humor.

"First time customers will receive Physical Gift Cards only. eCards will only be sent to returning customers with one (1) successful CardFlip Transaction and Verified Identity. Thank you for understanding our effort to eliminate fraud."
Hmm. Annoying. And this should not be at all necessary for those who pay with btc- it's not like they can issue a chargeback.
@_date: 2015-03-09 11:43:56
Go deep, they are in there Mark Marie.
@_date: 2015-02-05 13:03:54
Well said. Hell, even Neal Stephenson couldn't have predicted this.

Epic burn. No, really. It takes a lot of propane to power the sound system.

Hell, an entire life can be hacked. Shit, look at the system we were born into. What's that line?
You can feel it when you go to work... when you go to church... when you pay your taxes.
Have you ever had a dream, that you were so sure was real?
But to more answer your actual question: a lot of people are run pretty ragged as in your example, so I tend to agree with your conclusion, if bitcoin is going to succeed here, it has to be way easier to access and use. There has been big progress made, of course.
Perhaps in these use cases, at least for now, Bitcoin is more of a background entity, a sort of parallel would be how 80% of smart phones run on Linux and the general public has no reason to know or notice that. So maybe in the future there will be some Bitcoin backended or connected financial management/landlord payment tracking app thing that will make her job a little easier, and save some time and/or money.
As far as can it be hacked: no and yes.
The protocol and encryption are currently not-hacked and not-hackable. If it could be done, someone would. So, no.
Yes it can be hacked though, as far as wallet applications and the end-user security environment. And of course anything that handles the private keys for you- exchanges, etc, can also be hacked.
If you do it right (good rng, offline keys, etc) you can't be hacked. But that represents a level of sophistication that most people don't have and don't want. So it's the things that make it so easy to use you don't even know it's there that we should probably aim for.
I suppose there are corporate solutions (do the thinking for you) that aren't half bad in this regard that already exist: Coinbase's new 'vault' product where both you and they hold the keys is at least a start.
@_date: 2015-02-27 17:12:38
Hmm. Not playing out so far.
@_date: 2015-02-05 13:12:23


Every tank, atomic bomb, and instrument of war ever made, and still being made. Let's call it illth rather than wealth, as per bucky fuller. That is true junk. And how does it even exist? Well, it wouldn't have existed without fractional reserve banking.
And we haven't even really gotten to the hangover. Maybe when agriculture fails due to climate or the mass population shifts begin, something around then.
@_date: 2015-02-02 05:35:21
Just depends on how far away the event horizon is from what price you bought in at.
@_date: 2013-11-28 21:57:46
Yeah, I wouldn't bother registering to post about it if it wasn't true. It's certainly a glitch, but I wonder how widespread. Perhaps the system is buckling under increased demand or something, I don't know.
@_date: 2013-11-28 21:58:59
Alright, so it was just delivered, slightly over an hour after paying for it.

Pretty cool that this exists, even at 2% surcharge.
@_date: 2013-11-28 21:51:55
Been wondering why this hasn't happened yet. eBay and Paypal are not getting with the program, and even if they DO, i'm inclined to discard both of them if possible, given their generally abusive treatment of the little guy over the years.
@_date: 2013-11-29 05:32:34
And that would be a Good Thing, as long as they didn't eventually say "okay, fine, we're going to accept it now, finally" and then people, due to inertia, network effect, or whatever, keep using them.
@_date: 2013-12-26 19:20:16
Exactly my theory.
@_date: 2013-11-29 05:31:15
I like what you're saying, but if eBay never accepts Bitcoin, they are slitting their own throats. Just saying they aren't likely to do that when push comes to shove, unfortunately.
@_date: 2013-11-28 22:00:41
Not a spam issue, it just took a hour to be delivered for some reason.
