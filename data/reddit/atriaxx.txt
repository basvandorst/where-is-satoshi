I understand your point, but what you're saying is that BTC is not capable of having large amounts of transactions. Less than 1% of the world owns BTC, what do you think would happen if 5% of the world owned and used BTC on a daily basis? 10%? 15%?

I advise reading up the basics of how block chain technology works. When you buy coin you own a key to a certain portion of the block chain. If you purchase through coinbase then they store your key. If you transfer those funds to a personal wallet then you store your key.

Yep. It's totally Rogers fault that BTC transactions take hours-days to process.

I don't have much of a reply because I 100% agree with you. Very enlightening to read your response -- thanks.

No problem, glad I could help! Here's a simple analogy:
The block-chain (which is all the bitcoin in the world) is a large plot of land. When you buy X amount of bitcoin, it's like owning a small part of that large plot of land. You build a fence around your small plot and you have a key to that fence. How you store that key is totally up you to. You can write that key down, you can take a picture of it, or you can trust a company to hold that key for you. Either way, that key is the only way you can unlock your funds and transfer/use them. As long as you have that key, those funds are yours. If you lose that key or someone steals it from you, there is no way of returning your land.
By keeping your funds in coinbase, you're trusting their app and their security to keep that key safe.

You should really re-read your post and think about the situation objectively. Anyone could make a voting bot. It's not fair to point fingers unless you actually know who did it. Historically if we follow your logic, we would have killed a lot of innocent people.
Mempool spamming... same logic. Did you know that exposing weaknesses in technology has always lead us to technological upgrades? Things need to be deemed broken in order to get better. One day hopefully BTC will not have that issue.

How so? Gonzo is laying the blame on so I'm trying to reduce the blame such that people don't blindly point fingers. I address both of his point accordingly.

It's been completely fine to put it straight. No complaints so far. My only usages of Monero would be for medium to large purchases. It all really depends on whether or not you're okay with the fee's for small purchases. For small transactions I would recommend LTC actually. That's why I use two coins... LTC for small and fast transactions, and Monero for private or larger transactions.
Monero wasn't really designed for a cup of coffee because the transactions take about 5 minutes, but is still faster than BTC. The fee's aren't much better than BTC either actually, but Monero is still very young. It's more about their stickler belief of anonymity. It's one of the very few coins that is the very definition of crypto-currency in the sense that it's designed to be secure and private. You send anonymous transactions and no one can reverse-look-up your funds and assets. They also have dynamic block-sizes which solve the issue of BTC vs BCH all together.
Any other alt coins that you might support, just invest and give it time. Remember that most of them are really young and have smaller development teams. Given the years that BTC has been around, any alt coins would have already surpassed BTC technology.

If that were the case, BCH would be clearly in the winning right now. Your mentality of "only one fork can live" is a downward spiral of thinking. Before you reply, remember that Litecoin is also a fork off of Bitcoin Core. Are you threatened by LTC as well?
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:19:32
Honestly? Many of the alt coins are. BTC and BCH are cash rides for people that want to try and make quick money. I actually use LTC and Monero for transactions... BTC and BCH are just basically stocks with unrealistic approaches to daily transactions. A lot of the alt coins already have feasible tech that's simply overlooked because everyone is too busy with BTC/BCH drama. The general populace that's just getting into crypto currency doesnt want to read and learn, so they just look at what the news gives them -- BTC!!! BCH!!!  BTC!!! BCH!!!  BTC!!! BCH!!!  BTC!!! BCH!!!

I don’t understand... please explain!
@_date: 2017-11-14 09:24:28
Hopefully there is a alert feature for when certain coins get to a certain price! I find those super useful while I’m at work.

Life is much less stressful with alt-coins. From personal experience you just simply invest in them and forget about it. I'm spread on a handful of them and they have all significant gains over my mutual stock trading funds.
I think enough time will pass that people who got burned or are tired of drama will simply look into alt-coins. Time will pass and people will realize there are much better solutions that were under their noses the whole time. It only makes sense too, since the general populace(our parents, aunts, uncles) of not-to-tech-savvy individuals is just starting to realize that crypto currencies exist.

Hmmm that's not true. I post in both subreddits across multiple accounts depending on the PC I'm using. has open discussions about either coin. is more likely to shadowban/delete anything related to BCH talk. I know that for a fact because I've been banned several times from by even just mentioning BCH. Objectively speaking, has way more shit talk and memery going on. has been much more mature over any topics and I've yet to see things being deleted.
In fact, I'll be surprised my current post doesn't get removed.

How would you feel about fee's that keep getting higher and higher, and network congestion that clogs just about any realistic transaction from happening for many hours? Would you be okay with waiting multiple hours for your food and gas transaction? There is a very large scaling issue here.
@_date: 2017-11-14 17:41:54
You mentioned systematic advantage. If you're not aware of advantages related to BCH over BTC, then you should take a moment to look them up. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 23:26:09
Maybe you should find out who's doing it and ask them?
