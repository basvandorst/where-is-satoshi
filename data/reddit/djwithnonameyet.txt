So, why do you even have Apple products?
@_date: 2014-04-19 12:53:25
The big mistake of the bitcoin community is that everyone thinks all the innovation needs to happen in Bitcoin itself. 
Maybe some cryptocurrency that is considered an altcoin now, can do what Satoshi Nakamoti envisioned, better than Bitcoin itself.

We use the term FIAT when we exchange crypto's for currencies, which are acknowledged by governments.

You could mine altcoins and trade that for BTC.

I will match every donation times a billion.

Like BTC ain't real money.

Are you using the qt version of the wallet?
You're better of using the electrum version

I heard withdrawals may open soon which causes a bull run on relative cheap BTC.
@_date: 2014-03-17 11:35:45
You can mine myriadcoin

And get his already lost BTC back. This is why you should not gamble in general.

Truly decentralized cryptocurrency.
Myr uses 5 independent algos simultaneously to enable 81% resistance to 51% attacks (re-read this if you dont understand it). Also this coin will be the first to have massive scale real world adoption (Brazil).

No, you're wrong here. You only need to add proof of work algo's where asics are not yet developed for. 
This whitepaper explains my thoughts:

Don't you agree that centralized mining is also considered a failure of Bitcoin? It's always hard to discuss with someone who has personal interests in bitcoin sustaining it's value.
And my question was regarding how versatile Bitcoin truly is. Do you know anything about that? Can bitcoin implement a new algo specially for cpu's/gpu's?

Good thing I withdrawed all my funds on time. 
I used cryptorush many times and found a very serious issue: One time you could buy more than your funds allowed. This was resolved fairly quickly though.
@_date: 2014-02-12 08:02:46
LOL, you have about the exact same answer as me.
