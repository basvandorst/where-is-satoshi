people will do whats in their best finacial interest.... If i see i bought bitcoins in at 18k a share and they're dropping from 21,20,19... I am going to quickly try to move whatever BTC i have to another crypto that is going cashflow positive currently. It does create a chain reaction, and then eventually a bullish market will say hell a BTC used to cost 20k now i can get it for 15k thats 5k a coin savings hell ya buy 500.

From what i know and have read BTC does have a major issue, a few actually 1. Transactions, imagine being able to do a TRILLION transactions a second, thats the kind of network and speed we need, something crazy that uses IPV6 type addresses that are enough addresses for ever atom in the universe(but limited in supply so they dont deflate in value) - not saying we should literally have that many but the addressing ability. 2. These transaction logs are public on a blockchain, some people want to see that blockchain to be a little more encrypted , instead of being able to go through the bouncing around and tracking people down people want what was promised a completely ANONymous FREE digital Currency that will kill fiat

my current issue 
@_date: 2017-12-27 22:56:15
but how do you continue to easily buy btc on paypal,credit, or debit, cards that's the only reason people go to that and i looked at prices of btc on coinbase vs localbitcoins and it was huge people were being shady no one nice to sell lower than spot, everyone was asking almost 1.3-1.6x the actual value for a sale that you had to do some manual tranaction old school sit and wait type shit. and we have a "i want it now" economy

@_date: 2017-12-20 10:13:14
I dont like the idea of purchases being traced, thats how they already track your bank statements and follow your atm card, i once had mine stopped while i was at a mall shopping after business hours, bankers were never jailed we bailed them out the top 4 companies pay no tax, im just pissed

I tried running the software on my PC before, that always was a pain. because of file size, wait time, i loved the software, but it just still meant i still had to somehow get btc, and for the avg joe this is a paypal/creditcard/debit card thing, so you never had an easy way to gain trust of users unless u built up a support group site, that you wouldnt charge back.

theres a lot of people with the internet and a lot of workers and friends who were probably told.. think about all this wealth distribution and being able to almost double your 5x increase your wealth.. its just insane tho because it seems fake at first but people dont get that its real,  you better hope gas stations and place like walmart accept bitcoin bc u always gotta trade btc -&gt; whatever the fuck you use wherever the fuck that is (i guess if you lived anywhere else outside the usa this would probably be the form you wanted tbh, it or euros, myight not want to get caught with them but the USD is the worlds market not bitcoins there are 2/3's of our currency overseas in the form of paper

I would have bought some today if the announcement was about it instead of BCH which i dont give a fuck about or care, OG BTC is my crypto i will stay where i am at, i dont litecoin, i dont do the dog one tho i should have because its nice to give small loans like buy pizza for someone

Yeah it does suck that it gets the bad name because of ransomware and websites that in a way to me I think or using it smarter if they use somebody's processing power and says showing them ads I think they might not care that for that time being as long as they killed the process right after you know what I'm saying like instead of showing me a page full of ads if you just ran processing power to make it worth it and hey that's awesome
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:47:01
I mean shit 1 BTC = $17k dollars... thats fucking great for early adopters still. late skeptics just dont sell.... wait it out, itll eventually go up; idk i dont think this is any end to OG BTC its to widely accepted. wish i had about 20 full coins, could buy a huge house and pay for a car and buy anything to fill it with i wanted in my area.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:59:22
BUY BUY BUY boys, im ready to watch BTC go to the moon!! anyone who bought around 20k recently, DONT SELL, it can go back up tomorrow as more people invest and its currently the most widely accept crypto. Not saying you shouldnt think about your future, but if you sell you already lose, markets rebound and reflux all the time and its going to be different in every country what this affect means..

this is my issue atm  lighting network is needed to fix bitcoin 
@_date: 2015-06-03 08:41:59
True having a person using a pin would help, that's another positive answer two factor authentication.. I am really skeptical of payment other than cash honestly anyway, and even with fiat I never know what the markets might do to my currency value... bitcoins have a lot of promise I just hope they can gain more acceptance like you said.. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:11:13
I think bitcoin can get there ONLY if they bring this LIGHTING network that can handle Thousands of transactions at a lower cost. Right now im dealing with this  because the fees to transfer are crazy high

To review, if anyone says that bitcoin is based on nothing but thin air, that it cannot be a money because it has no real history as a genuine commodity, and whether the person saying this is a novice or a highly trained economist, you need to bring up two central points. One, bitcoin is not a stand-alone currency but a unit of accounting attached to an innovative payment network. Two, this network and therefore bitcoin only obtained its market value through real-time testing in a market environment.
In other words, once you account for the razzle-dazzle technical features, bitcoin emerged exactly like every other currency, from salt to gold, did. People found the payment system useful, and the attached accounting was portable, divisible, fungible, durable, and scarce.
Money was born. This money has all the best features of money from history but adds a weightless and spaceless payment network that enables the entire world to trade without having to rely on third parties.

exactly man in the USA youll always still have to tread btc like Gold and have a local exchange.  use this for example.... Zimbabwean inflation is fuckin goin mad, so let them switch to btc for interactions within their country even if hes charging $7000 if they convert all their money they could say hey a haircut is with 30ubtc  or go on a scale of what job or product you want for your service and be and everyone in the town let the majority that wants to go  with that, all the poor people instantly become wealthy enoigh to trade with each other and let them use international makrets that are less than theirs to buy and trade with ect..

lets start a bitcoin over and make it a coin that we own so were rich and tell people if they join us if we ever need to lean on each other we will. . youd have to have some kind of raiting system where you made micro loans person to person (think less than 100) for amount of time and then they get back a small token of however much tip back the person wants to give but should in a contract type chat be able to ask  for exteded time, but pay an interest or fee that the bower thinks is fair (not unreaonable) and then if they are a shithead over 100 REDDITASS coins then he will be downvoted, it wont take long before no one ever assist him. 
@_date: 2018-04-07 12:56:45
See this is how it works we ALL THROW OUR CHECKING ACCOUNTS INTO one big money cycling machine...... and anytime we want to buy something "reasonable" to what we used to buy ect, basically it would hope and depend on the super nice souls who contribute more than those who have less... tis a system that is anti greed.... you get a good feeling when you do something nice for someone so when theyre nice loans or whatever with ratings you can get pictures and information about where they used the money (it could be a heart warming thing) system abuse would be a reddit style thing you get up to a level and if you rip you get shammed, and by rip i mean going crazy just Lt tAMBO, YACHT, ect i mean it depends on your previous profile but we just want to remove the greed of money, this is a money where you use it like money but theres no reason to be greedy
let me explain with bitcoin, i CAN be greedy
but it is kind of hard... because  usually the market is pretty stable (not much as of late) but, I truly believe we can start by using our money freely with each other! like seriously what good is your money doing good in a checking account. I know my grandparents had 250k in the bank when he died, that money could have been working for him, starting some business... ect.. I feel like i have a million business ideas but not much capital, if i show progress on my idea maybe the investors could add more money if they see you making good progress... lending shouldnt be "i look at some FICO" number and hand you $5000.. no, show me receipts, show me work , show me progresss... the thing would need a central authority where during some point at a time if theres  a problem a random group of users help decide what to do, so theres no favortism among anyone... it has to be distrubed, this is so much like dogecoin but i want to call it REDDITASS because i would pay money (RA - REDDITASS -credits ect) on comments i want to downvote....

Oh Shit I didnt think about that, i had over 50 coins! :O
If the niche of digital gold is what Bitcoin users want, then they should keep the limit, and perhaps even decrease it. But if Bitcoin users want to be a payment system, then up it must go[.](

no I run a business, and most of my interactions from where I get my supplies to where I charge customers all pretty much is person to person there are what I call the "standard services" bills, the ones you mentioned that do come from big corporations but most of my transactions are person to person which is why I would love having bitcoin because right now I don't like doing credit cards, they take like 35 cents plus a percentage and I usually tell the customer I have to charge them an additional 3 to 5 percent to take a debit or credit card! so if it was bitcoin I wouldn't have to charge that..

I can not agree with you more.  Every tech savvy computer user here and the whole process of trying to buy the bitcoins was a pain. I eventually just bought some from other users on  on freenode. Being able to use a debitcard -&gt; bitcoin will be a huge boost.
