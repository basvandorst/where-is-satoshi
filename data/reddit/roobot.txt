How will they force you? They actually GAVE me as many BCH as I had BTC at the time... free money is always good.

People are still saying that about Apple stock. Just hold on and see what happens!
@_date: 2014-04-10 15:12:43
Is this the end? Or, just a damn good "sale?"

The fact crimdelacrim has been telling himself to buy *after* China "drops the ban hammer," leads me to believe it's a good thing.
@_date: 2014-04-10 15:53:44
Excuse the ignorance, but in your eyes, why is China banning Bitcoin a *good* thing for the long-term?

Sudden realization... I still have way too many beanie babies.
@_date: 2014-04-10 15:20:23
you had to add "as we know it" which only implies *things are going to change.*

I was asking about OP's security measures, not the dollar amount gifted. Being new to this, I'm curious if these measures need to be taken for *every* transaction or not.

One question, how is Cycle uninstalled once downloaded? I see no options for this...
@_date: 2013-12-01 22:26:36
For whatever reason, I just can't bring myself to spend &gt;$10 for stickers. 
@_date: 2013-11-15 16:46:56
Sorry if this is a noob question but, why are you doing this only to gift someone roughly $5 in bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-11-15 17:40:00
I see value in a Valentine's Day version. So many little "mementos" are handed out on that day; I'd gladly accept a cute red envelope full of bitcoins :)
@_date: 2013-11-21 19:49:04
Are you out of BitCoins already? I signed up a bit ago and I've yet to receive any.
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:20:38
I'm betting on this guy, if not for confidence alone. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 02:12:56
Can someone please explain to me how this bitcoin "tipping" works?
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:31:47
Here, we're all just speculating with what BTC will *actually* do. OP's advice seemed best suited to my current circumstances, so I'm hoping that advice actually turns out to be correct.

Genius. However, I invested earlier; prior to bitcoin reaching $200. Any recommendations on how to relay the fact it's *still* not too late? Skeptics are seeing the value now above $1000 and they immediately check out of the conversation as if  it's now only a "should of, could of, would of" situation.

This is a great idea! Please consider making additional versions for other holidays.

I, too, use Coinbase. Are there any advantages to having an 'actual' paper wallet, or using mediums like Electrum, etc?
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:24:41
Annoying, nonetheless.
@_date: 2013-12-01 21:48:35
None yet, but perhaps a bit-tip or two!
@_date: 2013-11-29 17:12:58
Fair point. Maybe it's a hard pill to swallow knowing my parent's don't actually trust my judgement. Oh well, chin up.
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:07:54
As someone who bought more at &gt; $900, I'm throwing all my eggs in your probable basket.
@_date: 2013-12-01 17:03:20
Lady bitcoiner, here. REPRESENT!
