Hi Sara,
You should be careful what you ask for advice for on the internet. It's possible to remotely access all the Bitcoins on the device you have using ONLY the information you found.
Therefore if you need someone to help you it's imperative that you know this. You should do your own research and delete this post, because you're asking for trouble.
It's like walking into a bar in a bad area and saying "I just found a credit card and I know the pin number, its on this piece of paper, there's probably loads in the account - can someone teach me how to use it?".

When people talk about implementing smart contracts on Bitcoin, they refer to more complicated smart contracts - what other kind of smart contract would they be referring to?


Enabling more complicated smart contracts means people will *use* this new functionality, which means more load on the network as a direct result of mast, not less. That's the point I was making.
Why would the next upgrade be something that does that given the most critical issue right now is the fees? It literally makes *zero* sense.
The next upgrade should be schnorr signatures and confidential transactions but the priority is obviously lightning, again, not something that increases the load.

@_date: 2018-01-09 12:22:34
Aren't all these functions from within the smart contract realm? i.e it improves scalability of smart contracts and increases privacy of smart contracts.
I suppose you could therefore argue that that has an overall affect on data going into the blocksize but not many people are using smart contracts on Bitcoin right now, so adding this new functionality would mean more people start to use smart contracts. 
Therefore these BIPs would have a net increase on the load on the blockchain and in light of this one could argue it will actually have a net negative affect on the throughput of Bitcoin even if it does introduce an efficient new feature.

The next valid entry is long looking at the chart from the 1h, 4hr or daily time frame. Right now each time frame shows higher highs and higher lows, the break of the hourly retracement trendline is the point to look for the next long entry. It should be within the next few days based on the charts *right now*. The break of 15k the other day was actually the start of the next bullrun and the Korea news ruined it. Really scummy behaviour.

You could easily argue that it "essentially" bans Bitcoin, to own a bitcoin is an inherently private thing right now, its one of the KEY and CORE aspects of what Bitcoin is.

Why don't you buy a property abroad in a country that you can travel within? Then in 2 years you sell that property and you get all your money back AND profit and you still got to travel. Then you can repeat the process elsewhere, you get the travel and retain the capital - even make profit. It's crazy that I'm offering an advice in this way, but its worth considering between you both, have your cake *and* eat it my friend. Really you can travel anytime if you are financially free, it's more rare to come in to this money than it is to travel the world - every other student travels the world in their gap year. By the way for perspective, I'm further down the exact road you are on right now and we think similarly.

The title has been taken totally out of context and is trying to imply something incorrect. The central bank of Turkey has stated that they think Bitcoin is a POSITIVE thing.
I can also tell you all that the Central bank of Turkey is one of the closest central banks in the world to be integrating Bitcoin into the banking sector. So, the article title is implying something that is just bullshit.
In fact, this is from the article, from the Central bank:-
“By 2040, everyone under 30 will have never known a world without Bitcoin. It may as well be gold. That’s the long-term case for replacement,” said Srinivasan.

I don't agree my friend. If I have a house you don't know what is inside of it, you don't know if I have a safe with 1M USD inside of it, if I don't show you my rolex you don't know I have one. If I have a big house only the people I bring to it, that know me enough to care, know how big my house is.
Your finances should be the same, the bank managers should not be able to gossip about how much money is in your account - nor should the cashiers be able to. But they can and they do.
With respect to taxes the system should tax luxury items and imports, cars/yachts/expensive houses/cigarettes/alcohol/designer clothes and jewelry etc etc. If you consume expensive items you pay the tax for it. If you want the best things in the world there's no tax haven or accountant to get around it, you pay the tax when it enters the jurisdiction. If you're poor and can't afford any luxury items you don't pay much tax. All the while you keep your privacy until you want to purchase the item.

@_date: 2017-12-01 20:03:08
Derp. The futures price is separate to the Bitcoin price. Not only that they are used as a hedge to each other - that's the whole point of futures. Ergo if the futures crash from people shorting how you outline then the Bitcoin price  should go up. 
Edit: 
Futures will eventually allow institutional investors to short Bitcoin on a massive scale because it allows them to do it from a safer position, a position where they can hedge, but they still need to buy Bitcoin *directly* to do that until the ETF arrives....and even then the ETF needs to buy Bitcoin directly....this is why futures and ETFs are a freaking GREAT thing for early investors like ourselves.

It was initially created by a single exchange in China, viabtc, propped up at a loss by an anonymous miner for 2 months, pumped and dumped in such a way to try to kill Bitcoin and the "creators" are trying to pretend it's the "real" Bitcoin at the expense of anyone ill-informed enough to believe the propaganda. 
It's emergency difficulty adjustment was designed to damage Bitcoin and slow down the chain enough to cause a catastrophic failure of the Bitcoin network as a means to promote the new chain.
Essentially its only supporters, the miners prepared to mine at a loss to prop it up, are in China - a country that is trying to ban Bitcoin and make might mining illegal which would be fatal for BCH.
A single developer decided how the new difficulty adjustment will change without ANY consultation to any of the BCH community.
One of the other main people supporting it is the very person who pretended to be Satoshi Nakamoto and then provided fake evidence and then when he was outed starting patenting EVERYTHING possible relating to blockchain tech.
Knowing all of this, tell me, why wouldn't the ENTIRE crypto community have a problem with it?
As a side point their scaling solution is just bigger blocks which eventually will force mining centralization giving more power to guess who.....the same people who created it, the big chinese miners. And this is from the top of my head, there is so much more.

Completely agree that something needs to be done. The problem is now its so awkward to mention this because it was brought up so insincerely in the recent past. Now that it is actually a severe issue people are scared to say anything.
I tried to buy a theme last night, they accept Bitcoin, the theme was 30USD and the transaction fee was 15USD for a normal priority, so I set it to low priority for 5USD and never got the theme before I went to bed a few hours later. *personal details removed*
You have to imagine how much I have in Bitcoin and how severely I support it to be in this position, so when I say that now my hand is being forced during congestive periods, and if the price goes higher (which I want, obviously), it just gets worse....it will **force** me back to the banking sector....how desperate the situation actually is for a solution.
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:36:43

Are you kidding? History dictates that people here seem to have a pretty astute critical thinking ability seeing as a lot of us saw Bitcoin that was going to be popular since before 1000USD and are now in the sort of financial bracket you'd expect of such an early realization.

Throughout Bitcoin's history the network remained usable at similar costs through the range of price. This is the first time that it doesn't. Your prediction ONLY happens with a blocksize increase or implementation of lightning that reduces the on chain transactions.

Coinbase is great and all, but they let us down with this. They DO have the resources to have people doing everything needed, it's only bad management that allows delays.
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:50:52
Can someone please confirm, because I don't understand some of the views I'm seeing.
It appears bloomberg etc are saying its a close call but futures might be a bit bearish for Bitcoin - but this doesn't make any sense to me because you still have to buy Bitcoin to short it.
The futures market is used as a hedge for both buying and selling an underlying asset, this makes it easier for big money to enter. Because it's already relatively easy to buy Bitcoin (OTC) futures create a level playing field for shorts and longs.
BUT as I said you still have to own Bitcoin to short Bitcoin, so the theory has to be that wallstreet is all buying Bitcoin now so they can short it right away? But everyone else is buying Bitcoin now because for the first time it is becoming properly legitimized as a financial instrument and an ETF is likely to follow once futures arrive.
Wall street obviously sees this too, so why would they fight the market shorting prematurely? They know an ETF should follow and so right now is THE time to be bullish - even if its the only time left to be bullish on Bitcoin.
Also, there are multiple futures markets arriving in quick succession, not just wallstreet - so there will be conflicting "plans of action". However they can all see one thing, the legitimizing of Bitcoin as a financial instrument and it has a huge momentum right now. Again, why fight the momentum when you can profit from it right up to, and after, the creation of an ETF?
In my opinion the futures are 100% bullish.

Buying an expensive car with your first successful investment (if it is) just makes it look like your investment was an accident.
When you cash in, cash into property or a new business, not into stocks or gold. Let your money work for you, then buy your nice car with the profit from your new business venture and leave the rest in Bitcoin.
This is what an intelligent person would do :-).
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:29:45
The fight, which I was significantly a part of, was to stop the decision making process occurring behind closed doors by suits without technical grasp of the issues of rushing the HF. This is the issue everyone had with it.
If the community set the date and it is agreed upon with Core we give ourselves enough time to prepare (another concern) and also retain the decision making process within the community.
Not only that but is removes the USP of BCASH and stops people from being scammed by BCASH right now. It is important not to let huge numbers of people get scammed because we have the ETF coming up.
I'd greatly appreciate it if you could retract your down-vote so that we can have a better dialogue on this, my points are genuine and valid.

The main manager of my bank, a very important branch, is asking me for advice on how to buy in to Bitcoin the last few days.
He/she also arranged a meeting with the head office to discuss it and they all agreed to accept Bitcoin as an underlying asset to secure loans. Then 3 other very large banks agreed the same behind closed doors.
The space for Bitcoin in the banking sector is insane right now and I haven't seen ANY public article talking about it yet.

@_date: 2017-11-16 18:27:17
Bitcoin miners should just mine and game the original BCH chain so it finds blocks super fast again, let it catch up to the difficulty of the new chain and when it takes over all the transactions since the BCH fork will be wiped out. Everyone that bought BCH since then will lose them all.
Serves. You lot. Fucking. Right.

That isn't an argument. Ask your friend what his investment of choice is during a recession or financial collapse? 
If his country goes to war, or there is a global war, where does he put his money? The bank? Under his mattress? In gold? In stocks? Does he even have any money?

@_date: 2017-11-12 08:24:33
Do you not agree? S2X was called off because it was rushed and organized by a few, shouldn't it be scheduled by the community and organized so that it isn't rushed? Doing so provides the clarification needed to remove the wind from BCASH *right now*.

Also, your other response, encouraging people to set limit sell orders in Bitcoin to help the price remain stable.....well this doesn't make sense either lol.

I'm pretty sure this isn't what is happening as Segwit doesn't work with base blocksize at all. It's entirely new parameters, "blockweight".
EDIT: When I say "pretty sure", I mean I know....don't know why you downvoted me lol.
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:14:14
Me too, this guy talks so much shit sometimes. I said the same thing in his other post (from my original account), EXACTLY like this one at 3k, told people to ignore it and invest because it was a good time - now look - he's still posting this as though Bitcoin is nothing more than a speculative asset. You'd expect more from the moderator.
@_date: 2017-11-05 17:35:15
He says freely, nullifying his entire point.
Now... pretend B2X/BCH is Bitcoin in order to convince newbies to get scammed out of their money and watch how fast you get banned. Those who were banned deserved to be banned in just about EVERY instance regardless of how they positioned it when they used the ban to push Ver's propaganda in r/btc.

Clearly there is a drive to mold Bitcoin into something acceptable for western governments. They don't want a decentralized digital cash that is widely used. They want a speculative asset used by a few traders, this removes its wide spread use forcing exchanges to close leaving only a few highly regulated exchanges.
This is CLEARLY their plan, the question is, are our developers in on this? 
The only thing that ruins the above plan is to increase the throughput of Bitcoin as this pushes the "reset" fee on their plan.
Segwit was a 1.7x increase on the throughput - once it is being used by exchanges and was proposed long before blocks got as full as they are now.
Those saying core is compromised with the aforementioned plan, who is to say it isn't those to opposed Segwit who were also complicit in delaying the implementation of the throughput increase?
@_date: 2017-11-19 14:33:59
I thought it was confirmed?
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:36:42
Maybe you should do some research as well, because the plan is to use Bitcoin as a currency.
However, you can't sacrifice decentralization for its use as a currency because then you just have Paypal.....and we already have paypal.

The code to do 2x was not difficult. Core was against 2x because of how it was agreed and the fact it was an attempt to "fire" them, wouldn't be much of a firing if they came out in support of it.....

If Core would set a flag day, which is what they themselves said they planned to do, right now - for say 6 months or 8 months time - then BCH would crash and we would resume our run to 10k immediately.
Can some people reading this please start spreading this stance in this forum, I got rid of my old account and am only using my joke account so no takes what I'm saying seriously right now. Core always said what the community wants they should get, well....the community wants BCH and Roger to piss off and this is the way to achieve that.
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:43:42
Because it isn't true. The miners are making an absolute FORTUNE thanks to BCH right now, it's actually them that played everyone else....so this gif is just retarded and delusional.

Segwit was "on top" of 1MB base blocksize, now the base blocksize is a meaningless parameter within Segwit. Segwit instead uses the blockweight.
Segwit2x does not change the base blocksize, it changes the blockweight. It's still built "on top" of the original 1mb blocksize even after 2x.

It seems you are only aware of a very limited scope of interview techniques. Do you think when people interviewed Gaddafi in the months proceeding his death they didn't intentionally try to wind him up and make him look bad?
Interviewers inherently have an agenda, being slightly disrespectful is an intentional interviewing technique as I've already stated - to make the interviewee look bad. It's not an accident nor "unprofessional".
Unprofessional is losing your cool and the interviewer did not. Only Roger lost his cool.

Do we know how much money is supporting BCH right now? We have no clue, if Roger/Jihan and Co. can get Bitcoin to approach parity with BCH in the new few days - what will save Bitcoin at that point? Literally nothing. Even I, who sold my BCH at 200USD (and I hold a LOT) will be swapping my BTC for BCH at that point and thats IF I can even get them on the exchange because of how the fees would rise at that point. The prospect of my entire net worth, less property, being frozen in Bitcoin is absolutely terrifying.
You and others here are just counting on the Chinese government not being involved in this somehow, because if they are BTC will be finished soon.
If they do have this kind of capital then literally the only thing to save us is to announce a scheduled hard-fork. I can't even get a single up-vote, we are wishing on a prayer.

Seriously ROGER VER will you just FUCK OFF ALREADY? You're a sociopath weirdo.
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:11:43
That is so dumb it's almost impossible to give an answer. The fact he is in cyber security, he is a dumb fuck. lol.
Firstly, how does this start? You go to coinbase and buy the bitcoin....now they facilitated the transfer too? All of their employees or the actual seller your buy was matched to as well?
Then as it goes through the miners, do you then search all the people who assisted from that pool in the USA? But the transaction inherently requires confirmations to be valid - so you arrest all the people for forever that confirm on top of this block because they assisted in validating the illegal transaction?
So, you arrest everyone at coinbase for assisting, you arrest the seller(s) (could be thousands) that matched your buy for assisting, you just go around arresting people all across USA forever for assisting with the transaction - and this is a priority over the person who actually did the kidnapping? Your friend is retarded, sorry. Send this to him from a meanie on the big bad internet.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:23:00
Holy fuck............the liquidity is fucked. There is a 50USD gap between the buys and sells right now.
EDIT: Jesus, clever fuckers. Look what they did to the daily candle, just obliterated that brutal daily sell signal that was setting up. They just saved our asses majorly.
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:31:09
He can say "well they are regulated" to that, the main argument is how many miners he suggests the police arrest.....because eventually millions of US citizens will be personally implicated in processing that original transaction through the validation process. Also, was it "conspiracy" to process the illegal transaction for all the other US members of that pool? Because they were *all trying* to process that illegal transaction....do you see just how daft his assertion is?
The reason it is annoying for me is that you have someone who clearly has no idea about the process of mining or validating a transaction thinking that he somehow managed to think of something that NO ONE else did. The arrogance of that is why he got insulted.
What he is really saying is "what if mining bitcoin becomes illegal in the US" and the answer to that is "it won't for a while/who cares".

BCH happened. r/btc happened. Roger Ver and Jihan Wu happened. You cannot be bothered to do you own research, with absolutely abundant resources available then wonder why you're downvoted - your question is more aligned to propaganda from the aforementioned than a serious concern.

@_date: 2018-02-25 05:57:11
Changing the POW is absolutely the wrong thing to even *consider*. Even talking about this is dangerous because it prevents more investments into mining - due to longevity issues - which is really what we need. Changing the POW would ruin Bitcoin so you can expect the only people that will support this are people in r/btc who dream about such a thing. They support a POW change and a blocsize reduction to 300kb, both things LukeJr supports *rolling eyes*.

I'm advocating for a blocksize that keeps the fees appropriately sized for LN to remain functional. I'd guess 1-10USD, I guess I'm wondering where the 133MB came from, what average fee does that assume?
@_date: 2018-02-28 08:39:18
I wanted to post but was on a "time out" there. They don't care about centralization, only cutting this 3% fee, hence Bcash. It suits them perfectly. Fortunately for us only a total idiot can't see that the only interesting aspect of crypto is "permissionless" and "decentralized". Even one without the other is useless.
@_date: 2018-02-14 12:09:21
I see some banks recently have decided to stop purchases of crypto through credit card, all this is feasible while Crpyto isn't mainstream - they won't dream of pushing away customers the second Crypto becomes "fashionable" which at some point it will.
You wait for Brad Pitt, Tom Jones, David Beckam etc to be paid (we have the money to do this now) to promote exchanges/Bitcoin/Crypto etc or to actually form a geniune interest and THEN you will see what a bubble is.

Price respected the downtrend line as expected, broke the retracement trendline and set up a valid short. This is perfectly normal, how far down it goes before the reversal no one knows.
@_date: 2018-02-21 19:11:04
r/btc is a paid marketing campaign for Roger Ver's agenda at any given time. 
@_date: 2018-02-18 20:07:02
Draw a horizontal line at 10,725USD - this is the main S/R right now, connect the 20k high to the 17,158USD lower high, then draw the retracement trendline that we're in right now.
You will see that right now we are setting up to put a "hammer" candle (japanese candle charting) on the daily time frame, a false low through the S/R level which will indicate an overly strong retracement should it occur.
If this happens we will see an attack on the downtrend line which will take place around 11,000-11,400USD.
At this point a lot of Amatuer traders will take short positions having missed all the signs that the downtrend is exhausted which became apparent at around 7800USD when a valid (but very weak) sell signal failed. 
What will likely happen is that the crash you anticipate to happen will actually start to happen in some form. The retracement trendline may even be broken and the trade will begin. Then you will all be stop loss hunted on a sudden reversal which will end up forming the first breakout of the downtrend trend-line and we will re-enter "long" territory.
Irrespective of the above prediction, it is dependent on the closing of the daily candle. However, by every metric we are no longer in short territory, we are very much within neutral territory and the real market is waiting to pick a side (very likely long in the weekly time frame).
@_date: 2018-02-28 05:23:15

I'll explain, its simply the phrasing of your question. The lightning network is a massively important and technically difficult upgrade that will achieve the impossible of scaling Bitcoin while maintaining decentralization. Something a lot of people in Crypto depend on NOT happening.

Sorry I should have been more clear, the base block size that Segwit was implemented onto was 1MB. I know we should average around 2.7MB worth of capacity now, but I'm referring to increases further than this. What I'm wondering about is the ultimate fee level required to sustain mining vs transaction through put vs mining centralization effects and where the consensus is to that balance at this time.

Up almost 500USD since my post.
You'll see...
@_date: 2018-02-23 12:08:40
I knew Segwit would, I was partly responsible for the BIP48 movement from my other (very well known) account now deleted for privacy since the boom from 800USD.
However, no one knew how lightning would play out until recently. Only now can it be known that it will be accessible and decentralized. If the graph immediately showed a hub and spoke model and no one was bothered to make nodes....we'd have had a problem. This was my rationale. However, this account was originally a joke.
@_date: 2018-02-25 06:00:19
Also want to know this..
@_date: 2018-02-28 19:36:59
Bitcoin Core trust the lightning devs to produce the lightning Network as the Bitcoin scaling solution, but don't trust them to scale it? This is absurd to suggest, it is you that is mistaken, not Core nor the Lightning devs.

Agreed. UK parliament are bit backwards, but open to listen generally. You will make a real impact here.
@_date: 2018-02-20 20:38:05
I know, that's why I'm asking this. If LN is too effective the on chain fee will have to be XUSD to support mining - where will it be? Where should it be? 
@_date: 2018-02-19 15:33:40
Didn't expect to be proved right so quickly.

r/btc: 
ETH will cause BTC death spiral
BCH will cause BTC death spiral
The BCH EDA will cause BTC death spiral
The new DAA will cause BTC death spiral
Craig Wright is Satoshi
Lightning will never reach Alpha because its vaporware
**Segwit will never have any adoption.**
@_date: 2017-09-13 04:31:33
Pretty sure it does son.
@_date: 2018-02-28 15:15:18
I had the same opinion as yourself until recently. However, the blocks have to increase in size for lightning to work long term. Therefore you still see Satoshi's long term vision in play with slightly different dynamics:-
- 1GB Blocks, 1million transactions per 10 minutes at 0,1c per transaction to pay miners - 100k USD reward
- 133mb Blocks, 20,000 transactions per 10 minutes at 5USD per transaction to pay miners - 100k USD reward
Please feel free to work out the maths more accurately (I didn't, its a concept), verify the intention of Lightning developers to raise blocksize to roughly 133MB and then write another article to clarify for other people a GENUINE and VALID concern. If two intelligent people, yourself and I, can have the exactly the same concern then its logical many others will too.

It's literally impossible for you to know that....so this statement is propaganda which makes you look like a shill.

Trading off imaginary head and shoulders in the 2hr time frame? You're doing it wrong my friend....
Right now the only significant time frame is 4hr and Daily trendlines and 4hr+ horizontal areas of S/R. Anything else is just irrelevant.

You should remove the above and just add at the end: **As the Moderator of r/Bitcoin I would like to inform you that we as a multi-million strong Global community will never accept any attempt to make Bitcoin the scapegoat for the failure of the US Administration's drug policy.**

Haven't heard of money laundering before? Amazing. Did someone turn your computer on for you? Or did you do it all by yourself?
@_date: 2017-09-22 06:38:21
The scum bag deserves it. What a c*nt.

I actually predicted all of this 3 days ago:-
It's not going anywhere near.
@_date: 2018-02-28 18:00:10
I didn't make that number up, that's what the Lightning developers said, not me.
@_date: 2018-02-22 06:27:42
This is crazy. I was about to post this. Congratulations to Bitcoins for surviving all the spam attacks.
@_date: 2017-09-22 06:39:08
So? EDA.
@_date: 2018-02-20 17:50:15
Big crypto companies should be erecting bill boards everywhere just saying "Bitcoin". This is great too.

Yes, I've heard this from the LN guys. It seems we are hoping it (Bitcoin use) becomes that popular, because if it doesn't we (future users) would be in trouble. Or am I missing something?
@_date: 2017-09-10 09:02:08
Piss off troll.
@_date: 2017-07-25 15:20:53
ViaBTC only, is China exchange. If american like me must make popular BCC :-)
@_date: 2017-07-29 10:07:41
Spoken like a true retard.
@_date: 2017-07-25 06:28:20
Yes me too. Core has taken over the Core and Bitcoincash is so better than BTC. Buy BCC now or you sorry!
@_date: 2017-07-25 12:41:52
Buy BCC

You live in a police state markb_uk, you're used to bending over for your government - so you would think this.

They violate Finnish data law too. They had it on their website that you can delete your account for years but when you ask to do it they say just leave the account, then you demand it and they refuse. Its all over their forum.
