We’re having a moral discussion today, according to 21st century values and beliefs.
You’re literally saying I must accept the 18th century belief that slaves are not people. Your argument that slavery and taxation are basically the same, only works if I accept that slaves are not people, which is nonsense. I understand it is a thing some people believed in the past.


Yeah I’m sure the 55% of people who wanted more tax spending, and 60% who believed the tax system is fair, actually wanted zero taxes /s


Only wealth and ownership of a private army should give you that right. /s


That would be 4/5ths of people according to the above link, slightly more than a minority

Yes. I think there's a lot of good reasons for the state to organise to do that.
* It has a long history
* It's popular, most people want it
* It helps many people
* It causes negligible harm to many people
* Reduces inequality
Obviously it can go wrong if taken to extremes, or if it occurs in an unregulated environment, but on balance I think it's overall positive.
@_date: 2018-01-14 21:50:14


But that’s incorrect, hence your analogy is stupid.
@_date: 2018-01-15 18:44:42


Yes it obviously is, the crux of your argument “slaves are not people” is a completely idiotic and indefensible thing to say.
Slavery today is entirely unlike taxation in the terms I described, it’s unpopular, unhelpful, harmful, and entrenches inequality


Which thing I said about taxes is untrue?


Obviously true, taxation in some form has existed for thousands of years.




Here is a breakdown of the 2017 federal budget expenditure in my country:
As you can see, much of it is spent on services intended to help people. I am employed as a healthcare worker in the public system, and the work of myself and colleagues directly helps many people.


According to this article:
“Only the top fifth of households ranked by their income - those with incomes of more than $200,000 a year in the financial year ending June 2012 - pay anything into the system net of the value of social security in cash and kind received”
Due to the progressive nature of the taxation system, benefits received outweigh costs for the 4/5ths of households earning under $200k, hence my saying negligible harm is caused to many participants in this system, 4/5ths constituting many.
In addition, I would add that relative to the real harm of a child in the bottom 1/5th dying of disease preventable by a public health system, taxation upon the top 1/5th which causes them to drive a slightly less luxurious car, is relatively negligible harm.


^ As per the above, resources are redistributed from the top 1/5th to the lower 4/5ths.
@_date: 2018-01-15 19:05:26


Except when it’s a corporation or private army forcing people, then it’s okay.
There’s no reason to believe the removal of government and taxation, would cause humans to be any less domineering and exploitative in nature. It just transfers power to those with the most economic resources. At least governments can be subject to the rule of law and independent limitations upon political power, you throw that away if the ultimate use of force is controlled solely by wealth and profit.

I understand that may be the dubious interpretation they intend to imply, however due to fluctuating exchange rates it would be impossible for anything other than USD holding to guarantee 1USDT = 1USD. So I think they have an implicit promise that the asset must be USD (which it probably isn’t).

How do existing crypto markets adhere to the efficient market hypothesis?
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:43:50
None of the things said about EMH in that paragraph are true of crypto.
For one, how could prices of bitcoin instantly reflect new public information when trading takes minutes to hours? Why is there a huge spread in prices between different exchanges if they’re all reflecting the same public information instantly?
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:11:48
Let’s see how crypto fits within the wiki article on EMH you linked:


Market manipulators can beat the market


Market prices react to manipulation, the price of crypto isn’t consistently set by public information.


Crypto don’t always trade at their fair value, highly manipulated, investors are at risk of buying at inflated prices.


Obviously doesn’t apply to crypto, investors can obtain higher returns by engaging in market manipulation.

Bitcoin isn’t an efficient market, because the exchanges are routinely subject to manipulation that would be criminal on any real securities exchange.
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:49:21
In an efficient market, prices are set by publicly available information.
Due to widespread manipulation, the price of crypto has little relationship to public information, ergo not an efficient market.

I never said that


I don't think you understand that exponential growth of fiat currency doesn't matter, it has negligible practical effects on individual lives.
No one serious about investment holds large amounts of cash, they invest it in other assets. Large amounts of cash are only temporarily held for the purpose of making transactions. The short term nature of cash holdings means inflation has minimal noticeable effect for individuals or companies, people only notice inflation over the course of several years.


Exponential growth doesn't mean fiat ever needs to become worthless, it doesn't matter whether a loaf of bread costs $1, $100, or $1000000, the nominal terms of exchange are irrelevant, you can add an infinite number of zeros. All that matters is that the rate of inflation is controlled, which it has been in most global currencies for many decades.


What did you mean when you said "graph says otherwise"? How did that graph contradict anything I said?


How does bitcoin take advantage of the inflationary nature of fiat currency better than the alternatives? You are describing a hedge against inflation, many other things can claim the same function, that is in no way a unique selling point of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-01-12 05:38:11
Okay, that isn't a reason why bitcoin is different from all the alternatives to the paper gold market, and not a hedge against inflation.
@_date: 2017-01-09 06:46:49


Lol, that graph confirms exactly what I said, you block head.
It says the purchasing power of $1 USD relative to 100 years ago, is $0.05.
$0.05 compounded monthly at a 3% annual rate, over 100 years is exactly $1.
The graph you linked documents 3% annual inflation, exactly as I said.
This is fuckin funny.
@_date: 2017-01-09 02:24:04
The change in the value of bitcoin has absolutely no correlation with the inflation rate of fiat currencies, what you've written is totally ridiculous 


But it's not depreciating infinitely quickly, it's depreciating very slowly. In my local currency for example, for the past 10 years inflation has roughly remained within the reserve banks 2-3% target range, bitcoin has never changed anywhere near only 2-3% per year. 
The price of bitcoin demonstrably does not do what you say - "bitcoin will reflect this depreciation in it's price by it's value in terms of said fiat currency", if that were the case bitcoin would only change 2-3% per year, relative to $AUD.
If all you care about is a safe hedge against inflation, there are far better options than bitcoin. Bitcoin has genuine significant benefits, if you're going to spruik for bitcoin please try to be real.
@_date: 2017-01-09 08:47:24


That's true, but also irrelevant, so what? It applies to everything. That's not what makes bitcoin unique and interesting.
That's not why the price of bitcoin has changed recently, as his original post suggested.
@_date: 2017-01-09 03:19:56


Interesting, do you know where I can learn more about this?
It sounds unrealistically high, 7-11% is the typical growth rate of the s&amp;p500 over the last hundred years, if practically all those gains simply represent inflation, it would suggest there has been nearly zero global economic growth in the past 100 years, which is obviously a ludicrous idea.
Regardless, the change in bitcoin price is nowhere near linked to 7-15% per annum, it still has nothing to do with inflation as the poster I was replying to suggested.
@_date: 2017-01-09 10:03:07
Something which has inherently useful properties such as a semiconductor, a hammer, a lump of coal, doesn't need 'backing', because it has an obvious value and exchangeability for other items of worth. This accounts for a small part of the value of gold.
'Backing' only applies to something which is basically inherently worthless, but is given value by the promise of exchangeability for something useful.
As you've identified, the value of gold is mostly emotionally driven, the price far out of proportion with where it would be if it solely served industrial demand.
If you possessed all the world's gold, and Intel Corporation had none, they would trade you other items of value for your gold, hence gold has value with no need for backing. If you possessed all the world's US dollars, and no other possession's, no one would trade you for your USD, hence it needs backing.
@_date: 2017-01-11 05:42:38


How is that different to gold/platinum/land etc?


Why will inflation of fiat currency cause bitcoin to make a profit? If fiat undergoes inflation, all prices rise in nominal terms, but there's no essential change in the relative value of goods and services. Why would inflation cause bitcoin to increase in price faster than traditional hedges against inflation such as gold?
@_date: 2017-01-09 22:06:09


Due to an increase in the underlying value of the assets.


That seems totally wrong. If I take a pile of timber, and turn it into a house via the addition of labour, I have created value. If I subsequently burn that house down, so that nothing exists but ashes, value is destroyed. Value is constantly being created by the work of billions of people, the value of the world's assets is consequently rising.
Most of the world's largest companies today did not exist 200 years ago, all that value has been created, the value of the global economy is not the same as it was 200 years ago.


No one is suggesting everything increases in value, let alone at the same time.


I disagree. If I turn raw materials into a house, via the addition of labour alone, nothing has gone down in value, value has been created.


Gold has had virtually zero gains after inflation over the past half century, where as the S&amp;P has risen significantly, I am certain the S&amp;P reflects very positively against gold.
@_date: 2017-01-12 23:13:43


That's what a hedge against inflation is, that's what they all do.
@_date: 2017-01-11 22:47:58
Okay, but that's not what you previously claimed was the crucial difference between bitcoin and everything else, otherwise it's the same as a hedge against inflation.
@_date: 2017-01-11 05:56:27
It's interesting that the exchange value of gold has risen relatively similarly to the S&amp;P.
I don't think it's possible that the value of the S&amp;P hasn't increased, because the world has exponentially more assets, of higher quality, than in the past.
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:16:48


It’s terrible for that purpose given the exchange value is extremely volatile.
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:00:46
Storing especially. If you wanted something you could rely on to store value for years, bitcoin is much less reliable and predictable than other assets.
Can be problematic for transfer also if you're relying on the value to be stable in the time it takes to: trade fiat for BTC -&gt; transfer BTC -&gt; Convert BTC to fiat. Also I imagine the infrastructure to trade BTC directly for local currency or assets is limited or non-existent in most of the worlds countries. If you want to trade Iraqi Dinar for bitcoin, without converting to USD, I think you will struggle.

I bought bitcoin in 2011 because it enabled online transactions that were virtually instant, low cost, and (claimed to be) anonymous.
It no longer does any of these things.
I also saw, based on the above features, that there was the real world use case for bitcoin to facilitate darknet market payments, at the time "silk road". I perceived buying drugs on the internet would become very popular, which it did.
Now bitcoin is not used for darknet markets.
Consequently, I no longer own bitcoin.

It was in response to your question, "Why should I search "bitcoin" in google when I already know what is bitcoin?"
I can think of a few answers to that question, but I linked to the results for 'dog' because obviously everyone knows what a dog is and still has reasons to search for it, so people obviously do search for things they're interested in after initially learning about them, and a change in the degree of interest over time may be for reasons other than "I learnt everything I need to know on that subject after searching for it once".
@_date: 2018-04-03 14:39:52
Which ones?
I'm sceptical, by definition among active managers you're always going to have a spread of outliers on both sides of the average, so you will have things that appear to be 'consistent' and a proven system, but over time you end up with a reversion to the mean. I recall there being studies which included notable funds with a long track record of success, that after many decades suddenly had a reversion to the mean.

The 5.1% increase of bitcoin represents an increase in the total supply.
The Fed's inflation goal of 3% represents the increase in the price of goods and services included in the CPI, as denominated in USD.
They're two different things.
The best comparison to the 5.1% bitcoin increase, is probably the M2, which went from $13.37 trillion to $13.9 trillion over the last 12 months, which is about a 3.9% increase, so less than the percentage increase in bitcoin.

That's a very pessimistic view of human nature and motivation.
There are a small number of people who are happy with the minimum amount possible in life, but generally people want more than that. The most popular product is rarely the cheapest option.
@_date: 2018-04-03 15:51:16


But we generally have motivations other than just providing the most basic shelter and food for ourselves.


Lots of animals store food.


Immediately consuming all surplus resources is obviously not what humans do. The average Chinese family saves 28% of their income, the average Indian family 32%. 500 million Indians eat a vegetarian diet. People voluntarily consume less in various ways.
I think you're trying to say that the housing supply to the population overall would be in surplus, which I don't think can really be compared to the behaviour of an individual having surplus resources, a single person can't overconsume one apartment. The amount of housing would not be in surplus, it would just be matched to demand, there would be no intention to create more than necessary.




Not necessarily a bad thing, and I'm certain there would be a limit to the percentage of the population that want to live in government funded accomodation for obvious reasons - many people already own homes, government homes usually have a stigma, relatively low quality, inability to customise, limited styles, limited locations, potentially undesireable neighbours, etc...
Government property is never going to satisfy all individual preferences to the same degree as private property, most people want more control over their living spaces than a basic standardised model.
So it would be an increasing percentage, up to a certain maximum point, at which time you would have met demand.


Everyone to some extent receives benefit from government services in some ways, it's not intended to be a reciprocal system. I paid about $38000 in income taxation last year. I walk everywhere, I don't travel by road. I'm not currently receiving government funded education. I haven't been in hospital for 30 years. My work is funding all these things, I benefit indirectly from these things, and directly from other things, I don't personally directly need to derive $38k of benefit for the relationship to be fair.
And living in government provided housing wouldn't necessarily preclude you paying an adequate amount into taxation to cover the support of yourself and others.
This is all different from your original proposition (was 'free housing = decreased productivity', then 'overconsumption', then 'unfairness'), which you can do, but makes the conversation unfocused.
