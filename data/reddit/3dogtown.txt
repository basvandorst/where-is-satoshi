Readily buy? Maybe. Readily sell? I'm not so sure.
Are there any verifiable cases of a person selling bitcoin for multiple millions of dollars or euros?

How many new bitcoins have been created in the last 24 hours?
How much of that 2.7 billion is money going in and how much is money coming out?

That bitcoin real estate site sends my bullshit detector to the max. 
Thanks for the friendly reply. And I hope you don't get personally screwed over by bitcoin, because you are taking a lot on faith.

True, and another group of code monkey's can get together, create a new crypto-currency that is created in some arcane manner, find rubes to sell it to and declare it has a high value. As long as there are more rubes who are willing to buy the illusion of value will be maintained. 
And then another group of code monkeys can get together....and so on. Makes you wonder.

It's like any pyramid scheme. Some people are allowed to cash out in order to preserve the illusion. 
The financial world will never except that some privately created imaginary "currency" has equivalent worth to hundreds of billions of dollars and can just be circle-jerked up to trillions or quadrillions because it's not tied to anything at all.

Cash is also instantly and universally convertible into goods and services.

Also because sellers of real goods don't want to accept something so volatile. Who is going to sell you a new car for 5 bitcoin when the value could easily drop thousands before they can convert them into regular currency?
