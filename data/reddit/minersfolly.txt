They're too busy patting themselves on the back over a successful inside-job/heist.
After admitting that two of their top account holders work for the exchange, all I can see is a bunch of crooks that traded order flow and probably orchestrated this entire mess to cash out.
Fuck these shady crooks.

I'll tell you what is going to be done:
Everyone will pull all their assets from this stinking garbage barge of an exchange at the first opportunity.
Then, they can fiddle all they want as trading volumes plunge and their precious per-trade fees dwindle to zero.
Maybe they can write a book on how to destroy a multi-million dollar enterprise in a week.

My theory is the earlier "network problem" was actually the first hack/test, then the rootkit/exploit sat fallow for a month before collecting enough information to PWN the bitgo multisig API.

But everyone still loves BFX for some reason, so I'm sure they'll pull through just "fine". Or get shut down by a massive lawsuit, either way...
@_date: 2016-08-08 16:20:57
The only precedent they're going to set is how fast people withdraw from their exchange.
I'd do it as soon as possible, because you don't know if there will be bank problems later, or some legal injunction that freezes all activity.
Pull your funds out, and do it as soon as they make it possible.
@_date: 2016-08-29 17:16:49
Maybe these assholes could've used the bounty to reduce the "haircut" to their investors?
Or maybe they're a bunch of scam artists and are desperately trying to PR-spin this disaster.

@_date: 2016-08-28 18:10:44
Extreme volatility isn't useful, but something that actually fluctuates has its uses. If it was a static line, there would be no financial incentive to trade it, for example.
Also, please note that historical volatility for Bitcoin has been declining on a consistent basis. There are charts out there demonstrating this.

It is significant when countries like Russia and China start trading energy contracts settled in Rubles/Yuan. Other countries are looking into how to trade with each other's currencies, excluding the dollar.
You haven't seen the ultimate impact of this just yet, because the steps taken have been in some specific areas, but it could just as easily expand to other trade venues for settlement.
The USD is being edged out, and the AAIB (China led investment bank) is leading the charge for Yuan denominated trade deals and foreign investment.

Been thinking about this for a while. It breaks down to these scenarios:
* Tether is fully backed and there is no problem
* Tether was fully backed but due to mismanagement or greed more was "printed" than necessary
* Tether is a complete and utter mirage
I'm leaning towards the second scenario. In any case, we'll find out soon enough. You can only print/devalue a token for so long before market forces take their toll.
If it is a complete farce, then I expect that blowup to happen sometime around June 2018.

The term "wall" is misleading. 
Sure, it looks like a big cliff on the book displays that show it. But it is really a mirage. That "wall" can be pulled at any time. 
Putting up an order to sell (ask) or buy (bid) is conditional on who is doing it, their time horizon, whether they intend to get a full fill or partial fill.
Lots of factors.

So to break it down:
* Don't use money you depend on, or can't replenish if it is lost *(in reference to loans)*
* Don't trade or hold money for others, educate yes, but don't become their bank.
* Practice proper operational security and stick with it, no "shortcuts" just because you felt like it.
* Have more than one backup, preferably in different places.
That's about it. Sucks that you had to learn that lesson, but you still can come back from this. Who knows, you may even recover the computer because most thieves are interested in flipping them for easy money - not trawling through hard drives.
@_date: 2017-12-03 05:16:39
You're wrong. I'll elaborate more in a bit, but the scarcity and non-rehypothecating nature of Bitcoin makes this very different than equities or other currencies. 
So here's the deal. You have to put up substantial margin to trade futures. In addition, you have to post collateral to your clearing firm so you don't put on a trade and disappear leaving them holding the bag. This is usually in the form of a T-Bill or some other liquid asset that can cover your account.
Through retail the requirements are large deposits that they hold on top of any daily margin requirements dictated by the exchange based on volatility in that market.
When you short, you can lose the entire value of your account - and anything else you pledged. Same as being long, but this point should be emphasized.
If some idiot shorts Bitcoin futures and is wrong, they get liquidated - FAST. The clearing firm does NOT sit around and wait for you to rack up massive losses - their risk department doesn't like that shit. IF there is a sudden move and it couldn't be covered by your assets, then you STILL owe anything the clearing firm had to put up to resolve it.
This is going to stop a lot of the games wall street likes to play - like NAKED SHORTING, which is shorting a stock that doesn't even have enough shares to go around to "borrow" to short with in the first place.
Bitcoin is an asset that can't be DUPLICATED AT WILL, so good luck trying to arrange a borrow situation with someone. Most likely, they'll try to short futures and get completely blown out.
What will probably happen is we get a nice moon high after the futures start trading, then we'll get another holy-shit-hold-on-to-your-socks kind if decline, which happens after we get overextended - every time.
It will be blamed on futures, but that is a lie. Just the same old pattern, repeated like usual.
The only ones FUD-ing wall street getting in are the same people who will suffer when Bitcoin price zooms to multiples their shitty alt-coin market can't get pumped up to.
Sucks to be them, but by then nobody will give two shits about their shitty alt-coin anyway.

The "high fees" narrative conveniently began right before/around the S2X drama, and continued through the Big Cartel Hasher coin debut.

Corrected version:
A small group of people wanted to have direct control over Bitcoin and its associated flows, such as tx fees, so they crafted a few agreements behind closed doors and eventually stumbled into forking from the Bitcoin code itself.
They claimed "muh blocksize" as a cover for their real objective, direct control over the Bitcoin ecosystem. After a few failures, they finally got a fork running while copying the Bitcoin name, because they knew they wouldn't survive a day if they had tried to compete on merit.
Thus, the BCash monstrosity was born, with its empty blocks, while miners danced between chains before they fixed their disaster-ridden difficulty adjustment code.
They now claim "low fees" and promise great adoption in the future, while a minority of players prop up the market for BCash on select exchanges to provide the veneer of acceptance.
This has failed as each heart-attack pulse is ridden down to the lower bound. The current narrative is "Core controls Bitcoin" combined with "muh fees" - but that is losing its bite as Lightning nears end of testing and Rootstock has arrived.
There's more in the story, but it is essentially the temper tantrum of BizCoin versus Bitcoin.
Its also why altcoin BCash supporters freak out when its called BCash, because it removes the ability for them to ride on the coat-tails of Bitcoin's reputation and brand visibility.

"Larger than the physical market" - you talking notional values? Even if you are, there's no way to rehypothecate Bitcoin, so that doesn't really matter. 
You can buy and sell futures all day long, and it doesn't dilute the underlying.
It also takes a non-trivial commitment to trade futures and appropriate collateral has to be posted prior to any trades. The clearing firm doesn't want to take the risk of you blowing out with nothing to cover it with.
This is normal across all futures markets. There is not "print shorts to infinity" scenario here that would actually work in the real world of maintenance and variation margin.

Dive a little deeper, the answer is there.
As a percentage the Lightning transactions off-chain are minimal, the on-chain fees will drop as well due to the stress of the network being taken to off-chain.
At least by a certain amount, there will still be on-chain transactions other than Lightning setups.

If you have never traded futures, or have worked with firms that have -- your opinion isn't grounded in market and finance reality.
The S&amp;P 500 Index futures traded on the CME are cash settled -- and those contracts haven't "pushed price down" for the component stocks in the index. Futures can go discount to the underlying during declines, but that is pretty rare and is arbed out of existence pretty quickly -- since it is a choice trade to make.
Like Andreas says, its easy for altcoins to claim low fees and fast tx times, because comparatively they're the kids lemonade stand at the end of the cul-de-sac.
They haven't had to go around the block yet. (pun intended)

* Using "Bitcoin" in their altcoin name does ride on the brand and visibility, which is a sneaky trick
* This was never about blocksize to begin with, its about control. If miner-centric altcoins win out, then absolutely the power shifts to validation nodes, which is a huge mistake.

I know what you meant - and no, it doesn't "cut anyone out".

The probability of SegWit exceeding BCash is very high.
The probability of BCash doing anything other than having perpetually empty blocks is low.
But you see, we've been told that we need "bigger blocks now", and when the alternative appeared, you would think the urgency would propel everyone on to BCash.
But there is no urgency, because the whole narrative is false and contrived.
That's the real point here, and its pretty funny to see it getting brought out over and over, only to see the BCash flounder at the bottom of the ocean.

The FUD around here was "it will get shorted hard in the beginning".
So yeah, having an open futures market and it not being pummeled into the ground is a big deal. It shows that people with experience know what is happening - a lot of redditors with zero knowledge of futures had doom and gloom opinions.
And those opinions added up to precisely jack squat.
Now, the narrative is changing to "it just got started -- then doom".
Yeah, good one.

This is called going "discount" on the futures price to the underlying spot index.

That disappears pretty quickly as it becomes a very attractive arbitrage trade.

Given that the mempool-stuffing began in earnest around the S2X campaign, I'd say there's a better chance of it being artificially induced.
We tend to revert once it runs out of money to pay for that kind of thing, which then supports the conclusion -- if it was organic, then the mempool would be swamped consistently, all the time.
It isn't.
Just basic logic here.
@_date: 2017-12-14 12:17:09
Its carpet-bagging on a brand name that is globally recognized.
I respect altcoins that compete on merit, like LTC. They didn't feel the need to call their alt "Bitcoin Light Coin". 
Using Bitcoin in your alt name is just a tacit admission you can't hack it on your own. Claim ideological differences as the cause, I claim the knowledge of how marketing works.
And this is precisely why Ver gets so upset about "BCash".
If its just his vision, what does he care what the name is?
Oh, that's right -- he depends on it being similar so he can continue to misrepresent it in various forums and online enterprises.
Not much different than claiming celebrity endorsement for your shitty product to boost sales.

I'll be the first to say that I like alts that compete on merit - like LTC.
What I don't like is someone pulling a land-grab by trying to piggyback on the Bitcoin name.
If the Big Cartel Hasher coin had used any other method with replay protection, we wouldn't be having these contentious back-and-forth volleys.
But they didn't, so we have this friction.
It will resolve ultimately when Lightning hits the main network, its just a pity to see how much time was wasted countering a millionaire's tantrums.

It reduces the number of low-value transactions handled on-chain. Miners still get the fees involved from setting up the payment channels and tearing them down.
You argument about "LN Tax" makes no sense - you recover any coins you don't spend, as does the other party if they are sending. Its a multi-signature wallet with some added features, including Tor-like onion routing.
It is a revolution, even if you don't immediately understand it.
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:10:01
If you look at the BCash attack on this tx stats page - 
Their fees spiked 1,030%+ from the normally unused-empty levels. Imagine what would happen if that shitcoin got any real transaction volume, their fees would be insane.
@_date: 2017-12-14 12:12:13
They're conditional. Like Andreas says, "its easy for an altcoin to claim fast transactions and low fees when they haven't been tested yet."
And BCash hasn't been tested, not even in the least. Their blocks are consistently empty, and have been for as long as its been active.
If the "bigger blocksize" narrative had any validity, then you'd see increasing transactions on the BCash chain. But you don't.
@_date: 2017-12-27 15:35:00
My understanding is its like routing TCP/IP packets, but with money. As long as one route gets to the destination that you are paying, then you're golden.
You won't necessarily know the route it took to get there, so its like Tor onion-routing in that regard.

You know, because he's cool like that.
Anyone working on measures that disrupt fungibility of Bitcoin is not working towards the main ethos of Bitcoin - independent financial freedom.
Lightning will be the protocol that swings the balance, since it uses Tor-like encrypted onion routing, which will provide large anonymizing benefits.

BCash or BCH == Big Cartel Hashing
It has nothing to do with blocksize. If you raise barriers to entry high enough, like the auto industry, you can operate with near impunity.
Steam taking the line of "too high fees" is pretty funny, since it was Bitpay that was processing them - and probably charging too high fees to begin with.
That could have been mitigated, but they didn't care.
So if you want to point fingers, take a look at how BitPay operates.

Simplest explanation is usually the best.
If it was sustained over long periods of time, it is a new "high bar" for the mempool and means direct demand.

Segregated Witness is here, service providers have to integrate - and they are.
Lightning is nearing release status after testing, and that will drive a stake into the vampire heart of "high fees".
The fee market exists for a reason, to self-regulate demand when network resources are not infinite.
Even non-organic attacks to flood the mempool can't succeed, because it costs a lot to persist.
I use the network, and have for years. Your post makes it seem like no one uses it anymore. Maybe open one of those blockexplorer visualizers to see differently.

Again, being a programmer doesn't grant the ability to assess risk. In fact, I'd say it hinders it. The fact that CIAndresen was willing to go hard-fork on us should tell you something.

Well, there's the problem. You can be a drama queen and insist on a fork publicly, and make a big deal about it - or you can just quietly post your fork up on github and see if you can get some groundswell support for it, without jamming a big wedge into the middle of things.
The funny thing is, the software is malleable and can change *(and has in the past)*, it just isn't inclined to be TOLD what to do. You know, pure consensus versus some blowhard insisting we fork.

Every fucking propeller-head is foaming at the mouth about being able to push small retail transactions through the network.
Microtransactions belong on a sidechain, where they are secured by the hashing power of the main Bitcoin blockchain, but don't have to play by the same rules.
Just take a breath and stop expecting everything to be solved at once. I'm glad the momentum of the network stops hasty changes - look at the disaster Ethereum turned out to be -- forking willy-nilly and now into two separate entities.
I'll forgo that entire mess and take the deliberate and planned evolution of Bitcoin, even if it means a ditch-digger in Kuala Lampur can't use it. (Nor does he really give two shits, either.)
@_date: 2017-02-28 16:09:35
But... but.. but... used as money for thousands of years - HEAD ASPLODE - Goldbug
My contention with gold is that when the shit really hits the fan, it isn't that useful. Look at some really horrible natural disasters, like the one that hit SE Asia and wiped out entire towns.
There wasn't some gold broker guy hawking rice for nuggets of gold -- people were stealing food from warehouses to eat and water to drink.
If anything, someone with the poor judgement to set up shop with a scale and gold pieces would probably get mugged and robbed of his inventory.
Gold is a good placeholder in terms of barter, but its also inefficient because of lack of trust - do you assay every coin and nugget you get? You'd better, because you could be accepting a fake. Think someone is going to take that extra step when civilization breaks down? They may not be able to, even if they wanted to do so.
That's the thing, gold has been used for "thousands of years" but so has mud bricks, and those have limited utility too. Its all about facing up to the fact that gold isn't the end-all of any monetary system, and at best only fits into a small gap in the evolution of trade and barter.
I'll take Bitcoin any day. If things are so bad that Bitcoin isn't around or the network is suspended, then I have much larger problems to worry about.

You'd have to go down the rabbit-hole of physics for that answer. For instance, how many electrons needed to describe a TCP/IP packet, how many are "lost" due to thermal effects and physical resistance of the medium its transiting, etc...
You could make a rough guess and pare the number down, then use that remainder as how many electrons it would take to describe the unique pattern of a Bitcoin private key. 
But I don't have that kind of time....or, you could make a simpler assumption like you have and just compare it to the electrons needed to encode the entire blockchain on a hard drive or other storage medium.

Near term, 2,500 seemed to work out if you account for prior rally multiples. 
Because open interest is higher than in prior rallies, that limits the magnitude given that there can be more asks above price than bids at any given time.
So, the "resting intertia" of the market is such that any subsequent rally won't be the same multiple as those past.
If you work that out, a slight increase over 1,100 seems reasonable, and most people who do that exercise arrive at a figure close to 2,500 USD.

Your confidence that central banks or any bank will survive the coming credit implosion is rather obtuse to me. Care to guess the depth of the derivatives market? Bonds? All of this stuff goes nonlinear when we start to have negative rates, which will seep through the system like cancer, until long-term yields are negative (hello japan) and even trickling down into the retail sector as fees on holding deposits.
There is no way in hell this holds together. I don't care if they make the next hyper-chain(tm)(r)(c), it isn't going to be enough. They'll be lucky to recapitalize when their margins get compressed to shit, and that will only be a temporary pause as they have to devalue the local currency to get away with it.

At the block that forks, you will have two chains competing with each other. Since you have one that is Bitcoin, and one that is BTU, you technically have two "piles" of coins. 
The trick however is sticking with the right fork, as I understand it. Choose poorly and your entire pile is gone (if you say transferred everything to an exchange and sold to own the other coin), choose wisely and you could end up at an advantage.
The safer route is just to stay put and not participate in the forking. Bets are in that the incumbent blockchain will succeed, which means don't transmit any transactions while the two chains exist.
Its a bit trippy like parallel universe kind of dimensional travel, but there it is.

Given the future of Bitcoin, and having been in it since $1 parity, I think it has plenty of room to run.
If your cost basis (average position price) isn't low, I understand being a bit more anxious about short-term swings, but honestly year over year Bitcoin outperforms S&amp;P 500 and the Dow Index quite handily.
Even when we had negative swings on a long-term basis, its not been so deep that you couldn't weather the storm.

Core isn't threatening to sue people. They aren't writing blustering articles on blogs. They aren't ram-rodding a solution down people's throats -- they are using established procedures to activate a potential feature set.
It is the miners that are threatening, bullying people with their collective hashpower and forming cartels to make a change in the ecosystem without anyone's input other than themselves.
That is why a PoW change is being considered, because they are threatening long-term stability for short-term gains - something that can not be tolerated.

Perhaps its just simple projection. He's alone, in a place where there are very few people that look like him or talk his language. In that kind of "isolation in a crowd" there are certain dynamics at play.
Lashing out at the only community that he's known over the years may be a symptom of this. Why? Because he can, and it projects his frustration with everything else upon other people.

LOLOL. Yeah, right.
@_date: 2017-03-22 23:55:35
Personally I wonder how "pure" his objection is. I keep thinking that Bitcoin has been used successfully as a shunt around PBoC capital controls.
This kind of control by Jihan could be a proxy for a state-sponsored "hook" into Bitcoin from the miner side. It would enable all kinds of nasty tricks later if it succeeded.
@_date: 2017-03-03 17:33:37
So when someone uses a FUNGIBLE asset to "cash out", it isn't FUNGIBLE? Are you crazy? Taking meds? As for Coinbase, that's their effing problem, not mine. 
Confusing company policies with non-fungibility means you don't understand either one. But keep on rambling about how I need to learn things, lol.
What a buffoon.
@_date: 2017-03-28 21:50:31
Stop moving the goalposts you hagfish.
I know how it works. I also know when I see patterns that are obvious front-loading behavior. This whole "blocks are full" narrative needs the mempool to be clogged for the argument to hold water.
The fact that none of this was happening during the BU-panic over nodes crashing tells me a lot - first, it was isolated to the BU network so the mempool SHOULD'VE kept up being stuffed, and secondly, during the "crisis" the mempool reverted to its CLASSIC and HISTORICAL behavior.
So stop braying about tx counts and rising fees and wipe the mud from your eyes -- this isn't organic growth, this isn't some dude suddenly having to buy 10,000 alpaca socks, its a motherfucker that is shoving this shit down our throats to support an agenda.
Or keep humming with your hands on your eyes... whatever.

The best part about all of this complaining is there are other Bitcoin forums and sub-reddits.

But yet, more drama threads. Hint -- **we don't care**, take your torches and pitchforks down the road, thanks.

We always thought it would be a nation-state attack (however, hard to rule that out entirely), but even surviving a home-grown idiot brigade will make Bitcoin stronger.

All Bitfinex has succeeded in doing is fleece a bunch of people who will undoubtedly get robbed again whenever it is convenient. 
My guess is after Bitcoin pushes past the all time highs, and really starts to make some "moon" moves. It will be too tempting for them to not do a liquidation-dash, and I bet they have expensive lifestyles to maintain.
Who cares, issue some crapcoin token like its a bond and work out of it again, right? The users let them do that, so hey, lets do it again!
Anyone trading with BFX is fucking mental. They will let you down again, that much I can assure you.

Some china-tard is trying to control the destiny of Bitcoin and line his own pockets, promising that his monopoly over ASICs is super-awesome and he only wants the best for all miners buying his equipment.
For those trying to stop him, he only has derision and insults, so he's gaining a hefty response as well.
He's also flirting with the very real possibility that all of his fancy miners may turn into hot-air popcorn machines if he keeps pushing his bullshit on the users of the Bitcoin ecosystem.
Its going to be fun, so get some popcorn and sit back. I suggest checking that you have control of your private keys - if you are using a internet-based client, I'd transfer that to a paper wallet or the new Core 0.14 client, which allows you to sync much faster than the old stuff.
@_date: 2017-03-16 12:46:36
Okay buddy, move along. Its clear who you support... 
We've all seen the video of Ver reading from a card like a robot, saying that everything is the legacy banking system's fault. 
Ver lived across from Gox's old offices, so I'm sure he doesn't have anything to do with Gox personally. That would be crazy talk!
Man oh man, where do they get these supporters.

@_date: 2017-03-22 06:49:49
What he's saying is that if your client doesn't use a local copy of the Bitcoin Blockchain, then its SPV, which is a "thin client" that relies on someone else to provide the full transaction history to operate.
So, to be sure, run a client that syncs to the blockchain, which means it downloads it from a given blockheight (the new Core wallet 0.14 does this) and you will be set.
@_date: 2017-03-27 20:28:23

@_date: 2017-03-07 15:57:32
Its pretty clear. A redundant off-site copy of the blockchain that doesn't rely on the current mechanisms for updating.
Its useful when you need to recover from data loss and don't want to introduce risks from only syncing from a given blockheight. For the blockchain "archivist" or purist, I guess.
@_date: 2017-03-26 15:51:33

He's a dude that got in way over his head, and opened his mouth when it should have been firmly shut. 
When Ver discovered that Karpeles was probably an incompetent boob, he grabbed whatever he could get and got out.

I never liked the marketcap argument. 
It doesn't imply actual usage, just a given total based on unit price x units.
If I make a DoofCoin and I have pre-mined 250 million of them, then offer them on the market for 1$ USD each, does that mean my marketcap wins the day?
No, it means I have a shitty asset that nobody uses and if I'm lucky - maybe someone will buy one or two for novelty purposes. No real use case, just a made-up alt coin.

How is "vibes" and "cool people" relevant here? This isn't a suicide prevention hotline, its a global financial network.
Its obvious to anyone with some history using Bitcoin that the "OMG blocks full" argument is premature. Have we reached 900KB before? Sure. 
Then came the "stress tests" and all of the other shennanigans (Which conveniently are not happening now that resources are strained trying to "fix" BU), like bouncing the same transaction between nodes with too low a fee to fill up the mempool.
Veterans like us see this and know it for what it is - a concerted effort to create a "crisis" then magically offer a "solution" to that crisis. We weren't born yesterday, this land-grab in the cloak of blocksize debate has worn other disguises before.
Its all about miner revenue -- that's it. And by tweaking the original Bitcoin source to create some version of Bitcoin that is Miner-Manipulation Friendly only invites the privatization of the Blockchain, which contravenes any open source ideal that exists.
This is why Bitcoin veterans can't believe people are aligning with BU, its the worst possible "solution" to a problem that isn't even a real problem yet.

I disagree.
Everyone has already made up their minds - look at the traded price. If the price were low, plenty would buy, myself included. To hastily conclude that everyone would abandon Bitcoin is a bit ridiculous.
In any event, if it did "kill Bitcoin", then it was going to die anyway. However, I doubt this will be the case, given its longevity and substantial intellectual investment.

I don't subscribe to the "Bitcoin to Zero" hypothesis, so that is why that particular strategy is applicable. In regular equities, probably not.

Maybe "Bitcoin Clear" - like Pepsi Clear... or "Bitcoin Point Zero" to truly confuse people. Its ridiculous.

So, Ver is an expat living in Japan.
I wonder if you get to a certain point where you enter into sort of a culture "shock", where you start to lose your own identity and begin to behave erratically.
This is a known pattern among expats living in latin-american countries, where they finally realize that with all their "buddies" and "friends", they really don't connect with anyone on the same level as the native speakers do.
This can manifest itself in various ways, becoming more paranoid for one, and perhaps amplifying other personality flaws that were once hidden under the veneer of being a "normal guy" from their origin country.
I think we're just watching the mental breakdown of a guy that is increasingly isolated in the country of his residence, and he has no idea what to do about it.
@_date: 2017-03-25 16:45:32
Oh look, a pedant.
When you break out of your horse-blinder stare, recall that the two "options" you present don't really describe the current reality.
What you are experiencing is being "wrong". Just take a deep breath and it will be okay. Maybe have a good lie-down and the redness and dizzy feeling will go away sooner.

Too bad he couldn't have used those abilities to see that the UK would take a dim view of some squatting anarchist coming back from a known terror-ridden territory.
But I guess he was just thinking about the "yeah, wait till I tell the papers about this one" bouncing around in his head.
He's an opportunist, and it shows.

Original poster does have a point, though.
ASICs commoditized the mining effort, so you can just plug in your magic mining box and not give two shits about anything it does. Also, in China you can only get your ASIC magic chips from Jihan Wu, so you're pretty fucked there...
CPU/GPU mining was a different beast, you had to understand how to set up a decent (in most cases) linux box, with the proper drivers and settings to maximize output of your GPU cards.
By making mining a plug-and-play affair, it allows those with minimal technical competence to dive in -- which depending on your own view could be good or bad for cryptocurrencies in general.
I'd prefer more education for the system before jumping in blindly, but for most they'll get suckered in by promises of block rewards and not understand variance or difficulty.
As far as BU, they'll reap what they sow soon enough. The irony is not lost that the only way they can keep their warehouses of miners running is through the idiot-box-ASIC device, as anything else would be too complex for a few low-paid chinese techs to bother with.

Honestly, they could've said anything. They didn't want to lend any credibility to Bitcoin because its clearly something that is outside their control.
The SEC makes noises about compliance, but the core issue is Bitcoin is not a sovereign-state backed system, and has no centralized "owner".

Its one of the better efforts at trying to dissect what a bubble really is -- psychology and other factors such as available leverage and regulation (if any).
I like his analysis because it syncs up with what is currently going on, where China has dampened massive leverage speculation, government interference/subsidization is minimal, and the price targets are more rational -- I can see north of 2,000 happening before people start to get very excited about price.
Dude must know something, he's dedicated part of his life writing a book on how to identify bubble speculative behavior.

I find that highly probable. Look at Bitcoin price, if BU was any kind of real competitor the price would show some large movement as people moved money around.

I'm with Core for a few reasons.
I could bash BU, but the biggest weakness I see there is how the fixation with dynamic sizing ignores the economic incentive for miners to cheat.
That's about it. I also don't appreciate BU's active insistence that decisions need to be made "right now".
We've been fine for a while, no need to shift into warp drive just because someone says so.
But hey, I've been around for a while and don't get as excited about all this stuff. It seems like history repeating itself when LTC and Fontas was pumping the hell out of it.

Greg is one of the most committed and trustworthy people I've ever met involved with the Bitcoin Core project.
He is correct when he says that the BU devs have very little idea of how badly screwed they are. To comprehend the problem, you'd have to first admit fault -- which they haven't been willing to do, from what I've read.
Its finger-pointing and everyone is "attacking" them. I suppose somewhere along the way they forgot that the ultimate arbiter of doing a good job is the code they generate.
Judging by that metric, the entire BU team should be fired, and by fired I mean shot into the sun.
Well, maybe not the sun - that is a waste of a lot of fuel, maybe drenched in some poor-quality accelerant to match their coding skill and burned during the next burning man celebration.

Its an analogy.... by having the PoW change on the table, it prevents miners from thinking they have the leverage. If clients and users are willing to do a change with all the disruption it will cause -- maybe the miners should back the fuck off and understand WHY this is the case.
Also, should BU force it, they'll be sitting in a pile of useless room heaters. I think that would give them pause - don't you?

"I'm using legacy banking systems and I'm surprised that it sucks."
Yeah, that is how its going to be until Bitcoin beats banks at their own game, by dominating how things are priced and paid for. 
Co-existing with the legacy system will only go so far, and at best will only be a transitional period to far more superior integrated systems.
tl;dr: Don't blame Bitcoin for what amounts to a legacy banking problem.

@_date: 2016-06-08 01:48:34
Thin order book works against you, too. 
There is no "free lunch" hitting bids or offers, so your execution price will suffer in a thin order book scenario. You can flash a big bid or offer, to "scare" people - but price doesn't change until it is hit.
If you trigger a crash, you won't be bottom-ticking the low, because there isn't any volume available there. It will trade at that low, then immediately up the book there's another order 50 points higher that WILL be your next best bid or offer - and that is the one you'll get.
Again, no free lunch, and it doesn't help janking the market around.

The real plea should be towards suppliers and companies that provide services. Specifically those that rent properties and provide utilities.

OKCasino has fake futures.

Wait until the PBoC gets a wild hair up its ass and seizes his mining operations. You know, for "national security". Then they retask it to mine their own ChinaCoin.

Futures, by definition are a contract settled at a future date. They trade at a premium to the underlying "spot" price because of this.
BTC Futures won't determine where the underlying trades. They are essentially a hedge for long term investors. 
Although you can "scalp" short term as well. They would also allow larger funds and service providers a way to lock in a given price, smoothing out any volatility. 
There's more good than bad, essentially.

In Nanex's report, its clear that the HFT firms at the time pulled the plug as they realized the market was moving too fast for them to run ahead of retail orders and do their usual predatory bullshit.
"Providing Liquidity" is all fun and games, until the market moves against you. There is no real push of HFT in the Bitcoin space, in the equity space it still persists but is slowly dying thanks to the efforts of IEX and others to provide a level market place.

Ever hear of currency devaluation? Swiss National Bank depegged from the Euro and decimated forex markets. It happened "all at once" too.
Other legendary examples are the Mexican Peso, where the leader of the country assured everyone that things were "just fine" and then proceeded to devalue by nearly 50% overnight.
Hear of Modi? He kicked the legs out from under India's economy by essentially declaring 86% of all circulated currency illegal and had to be turned in for new bank notes.
This also happened "all at once".

Since no one has bothered to summarize this guys stammering-low-volume video:
* His pool statistics are from antminer
* Switching Latency Graph - peak at 8 - 10 seconds (all block sizes included)
* Average block size histogram - vast majority relay in 5 seconds
* Larger than 100kb - shifts a few seconds to right - 5 - 8 seconds
* When using Max size block stats - latency peaks are near 10 sec
His conclusions:
* Higher latency == higher orphan rate - costs pool money
* For a pool that controls more than 50% of hashpower, latency increase costs other pools money
* Validationless Mining - Pool builds blocks based on other pool stratum announcements - this means they are one pool essentially since they copy anothers work  [ Citation Needed ]
* Ant Pool - Discus fish - BTCC -- they are all validationless mining - 62.5% of total hashpower [ Citation Needed ]

You implied by your "diversify by using different banks" strategy that inherently YOU do trust at least ONE bank to "have your back" if things go to shit.
My whole point is, that the entire banking system itself is a rotten apple core that only avoids catastrophe by engaging central banks to backstop their shennanigans -- usually on the taxpayer/depositor/bondholder dime.
Also, don't get me started on how the raw strategy of "diversifying" depends HEAVILY on the correlations and underlying counterparty risks inherent to the systems and institutions you choose.

As far as oscillations, the next mega-rally of Bitcoin will soundly put a nail in that coffin. While there are many uses for BTC right now, and especially in light of the successful Segwit activation, there are no compelling reasons to use BCrash for anything but short-term cashouts.

Love how this piece tries to showcase Shrem as some unlucky dude that just happened to get on the wrong side of the law.
Truth is, he knowingly aided and abetted illegal activity, and got caught. He served his time, but it certainly doesn't correct his ethical lapse that landed him in jail.

To add to your point - Bitcoin Core is conservative because making changes to a network with substantial value invested is by definition a critical enterprise.
I want them to be deliberate and careful in their considered changes. I want them to test and peer-review any potential alterations of code.
And every user in BTC should too, its all of our combined time and value that is at stake.
Anyone pushing for quick changes and agendas that require breakneck alterations to the fundamental rules of Bitcoin should be considered reckless.
Because they are.
No one is saying Bitcoin shouldn't evolve -- but I think we shouldn't do it at a rate that neglects consequences in favor of some short-term perceived gain.

Oh dear, you've stepped in a large pile of.... okay. 
An expanded version would be:
"Too bad that movie was like an endless meeting in offices and sterile trading floors, between rocket-scientist-spock, his bosses, their bosses, and finally the head of the firm realizing the shitty MBS products they were slinging by layering crap mortgages into tranches of pseudo-bond-like interest paying products were about to go south, as the model they were using was complete crap and about to be overwhelmed by market variance."
Also, even though it dealt with the whole CDO issue in the mortgage space, the "lets have a fire sale" scene was a sterile series of phone calls set upon a time-lapsed new york skyline, intertwined with static shots of fairly calm traders minding large multi-monitor trading setups.
Its pacing was rather boring, its dissection of the "big oopsie" of having CDO's in the first place was boring, and the office politics revolving around whose fault it was -- was fucking boring.
The only person that pulled that piece of crap out of the fire was Kevin Spacey, and that's only because he actually has some massive acting chops.

Someone doesn't understand how real futures markets work.
@_date: 2016-11-25 22:59:41
@_date: 2016-11-08 15:40:19
Futures trade in relation to their underlying (spot) value. If you buy or sell futures, you are either a short-term speculator making a buck, or a longer-term trader trying to hedge a position in the underlying market.
Implying that futures traders can "manipulate" the underlying spot price is absurd. Its a derivative trade BASED on the underlying market, not the other way around.
It doesn't matter if the futures market is heavily shorted, if the spot price moves up -- those traders get wrecked. There is no way to effectively "push" a market anywhere using futures. *(There is no limited supply of futures - you can't sell "them all" and force price down somehow, this isn't some clowncar BTC exchange like Bitfinex.)*
There are times when a market declines that futures trade at a discount to the underlying, but that is pretty rare. Most times, there is a time premium factored into the futures price, so it will trade at a level above the "spot" for any given month of expiration.
As for manipulating the underlying spot index -- that would be quite a feat, seeing how the CME is going to include multiple exchanges with differing depths of order books. They may even at a future date determine how to calculate a given underlying price on their own, removing the dependence on external exchanges (which I think they will do once their index products catch on).
The CME has done this kind of thing before, it isn't their first rodeo with a new product introduction. My guess is they want to become a market leader, and if they need to get that bootstrapped with a few of the smaller BTC exchanges at first, they'll take the steps to do it. 
The moment they can be self-sufficient though, is when the other exchanges better worry, because the CME has immense resources to court investors in their new offerings.

Looked up this guy, he's an Elliot Wave "practitioner". You know, the analysis technique that backfits "counts" on markets.
*(If you're wrong, you just redo your "count"... utterly useless for prediction.)*
His "analysis" hinges on how he thinks he captured the slump from $300 a long time ago.
He thinks that we're in a "Wave 5" here at $3,300+, and because of that, he thinks that we're going to "crash hard".
Even Goldman Sachs admits that a retracement to ~1,900 - 2,000 doesn't mean that the party is over, but here comes Mr. "Gotta sell you on my Decision Support Engine service" to save the day.
Gimme a fucking break. EW analysis is famous for its practitioners "holding fast" even in the face of the market killing their positions.

Its more like the S&amp;P 500 Index Futures. Used for hedging and trading by people all over the world.
No word yet on how the contract is settled. It may settle directly to cash value like the S&amp;P does, or it may even settle in BTC equivalent - we don't know yet.
My guess is they'll probably go with cash since they have the same underpinnings for the S&amp;P500 contracts which do the same.
(You don't get 500 stock certificates when you take delivery, you just get settled to the settlement price when the contract expires -- or marked to market when you sell prior to the contract being settled.)

You're right. Its the biggest "Call Option" I've ever seen in finance.
The amounts that were required to get involved years ago were trivial. That made your "floor risk" very small. (Going to zero, essentially.)
Now we have a lot of vested interest and people whose cost basis is in the teens or single digits - they could give a crap if Bitcoin plunges 100 bucks, its still worth something.

Don't be bummed out by increasing prices, or the celebrations surrounding it.
Every new high means the bridge of Bitcoin gets wider and wider, allowing more value to flow into it. Or put another way, the event horizon of Bitcoin expands with every rally.
This will convert shitty money into good, and after it passes a certain threshold, will contain most of the financial system instead of the old and co-opted financial firms running things.
We're in the first phase, where exchanges and the like are used to convert between worlds. Eventually when more things are denominated in Bitcoin, you won't have to cross their shaky bridges via exchanges and wire transfers.
This is the end-game. Staying in the ecosystem while the dinosaur banking industry flails about in their self-made tar pits, begging us to keep money with them.

Trading is not easy. If it was, they'd call it "winning" and not "trading".
You're really going up against all of your emotions and insecurities when you trade, especially if you don't have a solid plan.
Even with a plan, you will battle yourself to be consistent. The best traders in the world still stumble, its just part of the game.
This isn't so much a Bitcoin problem, as it is a trading psychology problem. You pick yourself up and get back on that horse, or don't trade at all.

Seriously though, there is an inverse effect of Bitcoin appreciation. When something costs say, 0.01 BTC *(~100 USD)* then we rally hard and its now 0.005 - you are more apt to spend.

Sorry if it was confusing - you don't want to reindex if you can help it, since that will require quite a bit of time.
The command I think you are looking for is "-assumevalid=&lt;blockheight&gt;"
If you have a general idea, or just want to knock off a few hundred blocks from the current height and only recheck those, as of this posting the current blockheight is 461,588
So maybe try to insert that command as -assumevalid=461488 or something similar.

@_date: 2017-04-05 23:40:28
Perhaps gmaxwell/nullc's BIP to remove the advantage of ASICBoost shennanigans from mining empty blocks will finally be the straw that crushes the Jihan camel's back.
The real motive has been made clear, it was strictly holding an advantage over other miners and mining empty blocks to enhance the profitability of a covert PoW attack.
The tide is turning... as for LTC... still useful for laundering I guess, but not much else.

Nothing is "destroying Bitcoin from within". 
Bitcoin is an idea, made manifest by code running on many machines across the world. Being the product of human effort, there are disagreements on future evolution.
However, the idea still exists, and whatever the results are will rest upon the history of Bitcoin, as it was the first successfully out of the gate.
To claim disaster simply because people disagree is a bit hyperbolic and alarmist.

Lets say you are a big bank. You want to get into this new and interesting technology space, but don't like the open-source feel of it, and think it won't conform to your monopolistic needs.
So, you do what you usually do, develop things in-house by ripping off the project that offered it up for free in the first place. Then, you hire some people *(or they come to you, being total corporate suck-up lackeys)* and get them to work on your "flavor" of the technology.
Then you repackage it, add on some middleman fees *(daddy needs a new vacation house in the hamptons with a heli-pad)* and go about your business like usual.
Problem is, "walled gardens" don't have the resiliency and userbase that open projects do, so after a while you wonder why you're not making the money you expected to make - after all, you're ONLY charging a few percent *(yeah, right)*, what's wrong with these people?
You then realize that your time and money have been wasted as the open alternative has neatly sidestepped a few problems your original implementation still has, and better yet, they've done it at a fraction of the cost.
How infuriating. You then shut down your particular flavor of the tech, vowing never to repeat it again... but then, you see this new technology... being a bank, you start to develop your own thing all over again.
Its like a curse.
As for Ethereum, if they were so great, they wouldn't need to resort to penny-stock-esque spam pumping... but whatever...

You decided to fork the conversation by focusing on intelligence "types" instead of paying attention to the core argument -- which is there are people who understand Bitcoin sufficiently at the level needed to get the "big picture" and deal with the smaller details.
But if you are so easily discouraged, I'd like to add another type to your list, the "Internet Warrior" type. This type likes to spew pedantic points in an argument, but when taken to task on the main topic, runs away with some pithy excuse as to why they can't engage the main issue.

A popular experiment to prove non-rationality is the auctioning of a 20 dollar bill to a group of people. It usually sells for more than 20, showing that the competitive nature of people in a marketplace will make the non-rational decision to pay more for a 20. 
The underlying rule was that the highest bidder has to pay, which should mean you'd stop your bids at 20, since that is the maximum value of the bill being sold. 
People don't do this, and thus shows the cracks in modern economics which struggle to resolve the paradox.

You just sound like every other person who decided that Bitcoin didn't measure up to your personal benchmark.
Yes, its ecosystem isn't currently worth Trillions. Oh my, someone call the doctor. If you agree that Gold parity was possible, why even pull that rabbit out of the hat?
Seriously, what possible constructive point is there to show that Bitcoin's ecosystem isn't worth Trillions? Is this supposed to spur us on and encourage us? The orders of magnitude meant as some shining prize?
It just seems like someone positing a large and rather onerous requirement upon a global system of value transfer, which has already proven itself worthy of much more.

Looks like you'd need to delete anything from the blk00417.dat and higher to have a shot at starting again -- or just use the "assumevalid" command to bypass that stuff.
Not sure about the full node part, I'd think it would work but I haven't tried it myself so I'm not sure.
Edit - Looking at my own copy of the blockchain, I see blk 417 but for me (and I synced not too long ago) the most recent blk file is sequence 827.... so, maybe its too far back to really matter if you use the assumevalid anyway.

Look at it this way, lower volatility means the probability of giving it all back is slightly reduced. I say slightly, only because you can't guarantee directionality for price series. 
For volatility itself, its antipersistant, where any large positive change is met with a negative change more often than not - a history of anti-patterns as it were.
So as we trend towards smoother volatility levels, you can be assured at least the overall market is maturing.
@_date: 2016-02-23 05:29:55
So, the main points are mainly targeted towards who you'd influence and what networks you'd infiltrate to spread your particular agenda. There's a nod to the technical side, but most of the article dwells on the psyops part of hijacking Bitcoin.
These methods, while effective on a small group, wouldn't be too great on a global audience. The more eyes and different languages, the more complex the task when trying to convince someone that your subersive side is "right".
And honestly, when it comes to the technical, there's an easy litmus test, either the network runs, or it doesn't. You can't fake that like you can a social media post or a tweet.
So while I'll concede there are certain targets that exist, I'd say that would be the case for anything that isn't totally automated anyway. You could apply these techniques to any organization, and depending on its size, have some kind of effect on it.
Overall, it seems a bit scare-mongery to me where you have a lot of generalities but no solid actual plan for enacting what he's talking about. I'd call the whole past debacle over blocksize a passed test, becuase Bitcoin didn't trade to zero and it survived a senior blowhard coder calling it a "failed experiment".
I'd say we're more a hardy surviving organism than a fragile one.

Investor interest usually means more volatility, unless the exchange involved has deeper order depth. The problem with the exchanges now is that most of them are puny compared to real exchanges (ones trading futures and securities).

Steem is a shitshow, having Delegated-Proof-of-Stake means the holders with the highest "Vests" *(biggest balances)* can disproportionally flag and downvote posts, and generally throw their weight around.
Its like the fiat system, where the biggest bank account gives you access to top tier lawyers and lobbyists, making sure what you want to get done happens.
It also is subject to slow-downs and freezes, there are many complaints when the system isn't very responsive. For those thinking "no fees" means paradise, you couldn't be more wrong than to pick Steem or its easily-gamed social platform, Steemit.

Thanks to dancing-monkey-boy, its been getting REKT on the transactions (tx) front and fees.
Roger has been running his own mining pool, and is trying to do the same tricks Antpool used to do, namely mining empty/sub-1MB blocks with as few transactions as he can.
This tells me since Antpool is now mining full 1MB blocks, that there's been a split between Ver and Jihan. It doesn't surprise me, they're both pretty mercenary when it comes to "partnerships".
Losing the Antpool dudes is going to really hurt Ver in the long run, and its starting to show - note the desperation in booking flashy promo-conferences and his recent partnership with a money laundering criminal to build his shitfork resort.
Those things are being worked on to project a front of confidence, when its pretty easy to see its only for visual effect and has zero contribution to their dwindling ecosystem.

Exactly, all the shitforks and shitcoins that proudly proclaim "faster tx/confirm times" not only have a massive scaling problem, it could easily sink their entire chain due to lack of resources of their nodes.
There is no free lunch, and all the knob twiddling in the world isn't going to save these twitch-coins when there's any use of their system.
The ETH blockchain is 3 TIMES bigger than the Bitcoin chain, and you have to be connected continuously to have a prayer in hell in keeping up.
Same forces at work with BeeeeeCash, their fees rocket to the moon when there's the slightest bit of usage - reflected in the spikes at 
Its just funny how every idiot has to go off on their own to "prove" something that is already known. You can't just arbitrarily ramp confirm times and think you're good to go. *(Or other parameters for that matter.)*
The only reason some alts are working is that nobody really is flocking to them. Like BeeeeeCash's order-of-magnitude transactions BELOW Bitcoin -- and have been since it was introduced.
@_date: 2018-03-06 06:46:12

And they can't even keep up, that's how galvanizing their hate is. Now that fees have compressed right into the domain of BeeeeeeeCash, their talking points have been rendered useless.
It has been funny seeing it all go exactly opposite of what Buttchin dancing monkey boy wanted.

Given the transfer to the trustee, it happened some time ~~around the big smack-down of March 5th or so. The funds were transferred shortly after.~~
~~So, in a way we did get Goxxed right when Bitcoin was consolidating up near 11,500 or so.~~

Bitcoin fees have been low enough to accelerate utility - such as the adoption of the Lightning Network, which is expanding at a rate that even your Lord Monkey Boy Leader doesn't have enough money to spam all the nodes, unlike his concerted mempool stuffing antics before SegWit got more traction.

Just one of the many reasons he's a complete ego-centric twat.
There is light at the end of the tunnel, I've noticed that Antpool has been mining 1 MB blocks instead of empty ones more consistently -- while Ver's mining pool is mining empty blocks and sub 1MB blocks.

Please show me where the DAO "hacker" used a non-implemented command in the underlying VM.
The point is - and you seem to be ardently trying not to draw attention to - is that the turing-complete "smart contract" language that Vitalik thought was "A-Okay" was used to move funds to someone's wallet.
And he didn't let it stand, and say "yep, you know - it was valid smart contract language, I can't tell someone how to manage their money".
No, Lord King Vitalik made a decision that impacted many people, and constructed his plan in a way that if you didn't know about the "vote", you just AGREED TO IT ANYWAY.

He likes to conflate Bitcoin Core with Blockstream, even though Ver's own effort is supported by Garzik who owns Block, Inc.
Blockstream is a small portion of the actual contributors to Bitcoin's code, while Garzik is one of the lone (and bad) developers working on BCrash and other schemes.
Its just hilarious to me to see this guy do his little monkey dance on stage, and then point blame at someone -- who actually helped their shitty code so their clients wouldn't ban each other.

Its not about Vitalik being a "nice guy" -- its the fact that he's the de facto leader of a alt-coin.
You shouldn't have anyone being a figurehead, and you definitely shouldn't have someone making unilateral decisions about rolling back the chain -- which by the way was conducted in a manner that you had to OPT OUT of the decision to roll back.
Many people didn't even KNOW THE VOTE WAS HAPPENING much less how to do it -- and because of that bullshit, their change was approved under the contrived auspices of "everyone voted".
That isn't CONSENSUS.
You know who else likes enforcing shit and having you OPT-IN by default? Fucking Jeff Garzik, who's tried to pull that trick a time or two.
It was bullshit then, and it was bullshit when Vitalik and company did it for their DAO "oopsie".

It seems that Antpool has flipped over to participating in the network, while Buttchin Mining Pool is now the bad actor mining empty and under-sized blocks.

Brokers and advisors also like products where they can make their "skim" or round-turn on the transaction.
Bitcoin doesn't afford such an opening, unless you are trading derivatives on the underlying.

Most of these retards don't even know what a "bubble" is.
The classic definition is an asset that reaches a massive high, then crashes 90%+ back to where it started, often going to zero.
Any fucking idiot suggesting that the billions invested in the BTC ecosystem is just going to "go away" have bigger problems. Those problems are critical thinking and lack of financial markets experience.

Andreas alludes to it a tangential way during an answer about ICO's. The jist of it is, that investors will make mistakes, and when they get burned they won't make the same mistakes again.

I give that guy credit for challenging Ver on stage. Is there a reason why Ver is lisping so much? Maybe its just the microphone.
Ver seems to think that talking faster makes it true. It really reads like someone stammering to support their point. 
Ver loses it a bit when the guy makes the centralization point - that's when he says "don't use it". He's playing to his crowd.
But the tone of his voice belies his stress, he sounds like a kid losing an argument on a playground.

He's like that guy you'd have a beer with, but you don't really talk Bitcoin with him because you know he'd go to the usual talking points of someone hooked into the legacy system.
"Its created out of nothing!" *(So is fiat currency)*
"Nobody is in control!" *(It makes it more robust and censor-proof)*
"You could lose everything!" *(Early adopters took the risk, and that risk declines with every passing year Bitcoin functions.)*

Let them try. Got all my shit lined up.
@_date: 2018-03-10 19:55:20
I think it is in progress. Witness the wild and desperate stories coming out of them now their "muh high fees" narrative has been dashed to pieces.
They're fixating on google trends searches ( LOL and other misdirections to avoid confronting the truth.
The truth is, ever since its inception, Bitcoin has had 10x the transaction volume (order of magnitude), and with fees compressed into the domain of BeeeeeeeCash, there really isn't any reason to use a shitfork coin.
What is even more hilarious, is if you peruse fork.lol/tx/txs and find a good spike on BeeeeeCash, you'll also see a corresponding massive spike on their fees.
It can't even handle spurious usage without moon-ing on the fee side, which is hilarious. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 06:12:27
Then why hasn't Gemini, one of the most regulated exchanges out there, touched Tether at all?
Your "assess risk properly" narrative doesn't hold much water if other exchanges that are regulated and fully compliant don't want to touch Tether.

Does this mean he's giving up on BCrash and Segshit2x?
Or does he intend to divide his shitty coding skills between several projects?

Wrong as usual. Declines happen after every all-time high. This is what, the 4th or 5th major cycle?
As for fees, Dancing Monkey Boy's shitfork has a diminutive number of transactions compared to Bitcoin *(BTC has ten times MORE transactions or higher)*, and the fees have compressed down into shitfork's domain.

If you don't have the same hashpower as the Bitcoin network, you're not as secure.
If you don't have the same quality devs that are using the original code in your fork, you're not as secure.
If another alt has a feature that is worthy, it can be recommended to be included in Bitcoin. Extend and embrace works both ways.
Just keep it in mind before you go crazy on alts.

Garzik saw the writing on the wall and devised his "back door" exit.
You see, it looks a lot better that he's leaving for a new shitcoin instead of admitting his current project is a stillborn deformed blob of hostile intentions.
I welcome his new "Metronome" effort, it should be equally hilarious seeing him try to make a horse race out of it.

I think Max just says shit now to get views.
Cornering the market also means driving up the price to extremely high levels, costing even more to get the remaining float.

Today its around 6.72 Yuan to the US Dollar.
This is going to increase past 6.80, as the Chinese have a lot of internal troubles that won't be helped if their currency isn't steadily devalued (thus increasing the amount per dollar).
They are trying to protect their exports, and it will help for a while but ultimately any debt burden (which they have in amazing amounts) will be the overhang on their once-stellar GDP.
Every country is doing this, in drips and drabs -- but China is hitting it rather hard when it comes to currency devaluation.

This guy is an absolute twat, and the tactics he employs shows he's on increasingly fragile ground. I fully expect him to lose his shit mentally this year.
Largely due to the fact that nothing he thought would happen IS happening, and when that narrative is spun so tight and can't be flipped around pretzel-style to conform to his internal world view, it will shatter and he'll flip out.

All fiat currencies are playing the "beggar-thy-neighbor" game due to debt issuance and devaluation. This has nothing to do with Brexit, but the central banking cartel being backed into a corner.
The last man standing will probably be the US Dollar or the Yuan, right before everything totally implodes. Japan is slowly realizing they can't move the needle on their massive debt maintenance.

I don't miss Gavin.
He always seemed to me to be someone that would bowl over in a stiff wind. No real "spine" really. It was evident in his dealings with other people.
And now, since we see he is easily influenced by the likes of Craig Wright and Mike Hearn, it just put the icing on the wobbly jello cake.
I'm glad he's off huffing about whatever on twitter. We need actual leads, not willing supplicants to the CIA. And yes, he should've told them to get stuffed when they asked -- or better yet, pointed them at the whitepaper and say "you are smart enough to figure this out, right?".
But of course not, he had his little three-letter agency meeting and Satoshi became a ghost.
Effing Gavin....

Hurst Exponent disagrees.
Its a measure of analyzing time-series data to see of past data points influence the future ones. Anything above 0.5 is non-random, so "persistent" with past changes being meaningful.

It takes a lot more money to send Bitcoin higher than it did when it was trading at $10, $100, or even $1,000.

Again, another programmer missing the point about ethics. Must be a logical blind spot your profession shares.
Snuggling up to the banking cartel is most certainly an ethical lapse. But don't take my word for it, perhaps watch this oscar-winning documentary about the financial wizards that caused the 2008 implosion -- 
Hey, lets all sign up to help banks out! After all, they're just a poor oligopoly that only net Billions per quarter. Even with profits aside, banks frequently violate their own rules and get away with it, the HSBC laundering scandal, LIBOR fixing scandal, hell, just take any major financial scandal and there's a bank waiting at the end of it.
But no, Mike is a gleaming white unicorn who can do no wrong, just innocently batting his eyes as he trots up to the banking trough to "continue his career". Yeah, a career that is motivated by the most base needs of humanity, with zero fucks given about the consequences.
As for blockchain tech in general, yes, its fully expected the banks will try to sleaze their way into using new tech, reinventing the wheel as they go along. Its in their nature, "not made here" syndrome writ large as they reduplicate effort better spent elsewhere.
It should be amusing while they are spinning their wheels with Hearn's contributions. I can only laugh and point at the obvious spectacle that all of his self-promotional efforts have become, and the increasingly obtuse rationalizations of his supporters.
@_date: 2017-05-29 14:25:51

It isn't funny, because Gavin threw out his own ruleset and proclaimed this scammer satoshi. He allowed a con-man to get past him and blow him over with "proof" that isn't viable.
This indicates that Gavin is at the very least very gullible, and at the very worst totally incompetent when it comes to judge of intent and character.
It also calls into question his other alliances (Hearn) and other decisions that fly in the face of consensus. I'm glad his access got revoked, because simply there is very little left to trust.
He could perhaps help Mark with a new exchange after he gets out of jail, but for anything Bitcoin-related, now... forget it.
I vote "no confidence" in Gavin, simply because his track record has gone past the point of any return.

Yes, we had a big swing, No, it isn't what I'd call a "crash". I've seen real crashes. Big bars that make you suck air in through your gritted teeth. 
This was a slow move, taking 40 hours from the 1800+ high. That kind of lethargic slump is not a "crash" to me. But I'm more specific than most, because I've been around the block.

In this case, not only is BFX still having problems getting any kind of traditional banking relationships going, now they're going to have an audit hanging over their heads. What happens when irregularities are discovered?
Even if nothing is found, what bank is going to touch BFX with a ten meter pole after all of this is over? That's the big question.
If Wells Fargo won't touch BFX because of the stink, in the form of potential financial regulatory problems, who the hell will?

What I'm saying is, if the CME is interested and they think it has any volume potential at all, they'll list it. Mark my words.

Lets say I court Gavin to incorporate my Know-Your-Customer or Anti-Money-Laundering idea into Bitcoin. I give him a "convincing" demonstration why he should, so he crafts a BIP in a way that hides the true intent of what will change, because, we should just trust him, and why argue over every little detail.
That is the danger I'm talking about, and leaving the whole blocksize aside, anyone that can bamboozle the "Chief Bitcoin Scientist" is frankly making Gavin an open vector for attack on Bitcoin.

Honestly, Gavin seems bewildered why someone wouldn't want to talk to him because he agreed to a meeting with an agency that topples governments and commits subterfuge on a daily basis.
Gavin is either a complete idiot, or he's fully compromised. Both lead to bad decisions.

@_date: 2016-05-19 00:52:37
Bollinger Bands are particularly useful when you want to see if market activity is reaching a certain minimum. It implies that volatility will increase, since volatility itself is a anti-persistent series (positive values met with negatives, negative values met with positives).
The inventor of this indicator thinks volatility on a weekly basis will increase, and he's probably right. Nothing earth-shattering, but interesting from a timing perspective.

Gavin is a spineless schmuck who happened to be in the right place at the right time. Satoshi didn't "give" anything to Gavin, he claimed it on his own.
That is also why spineless Gavin met with the CIA, because frankly, he didn't have the backbone to say "no". After all, with a wife and a house nestled in &lt; redacted &gt; state, he was totally "on grid" and completely enured to the system anyway.
It makes sense that the CIA approached him. He has no willpower other than following those that exhibit stronger characteristics. (Even if they're morally bankrupt, like Craig Wright and Mike Hearn.)

CIAndresen always made me wonder why he bothered to talk to them at all. They have their own analysts, it isn't like they needed someone to drone through a slide deck.
It was more about making the personal meeting, and perhaps a few whispers in the ear about "National Security" and "say anything and we have you by the balls" kind of conversations.

Good luck using Chinese exchanges, I'm sure their "deep" orderbook will satisfy your trading whims. That is, until you put in a real sized order.
As for Bitstamp, sure why not, but the Chinese exchanges lead the way in lying about volume in the Bitcoin space. Just look at the volume by currency pie charts on bitcoincharts.com or other sites.
They are outright liars, and I don't "feign outrage", I just point out that salient fact whenever someone brings it up. I also don't trade on Chinese exchanges, because I can't fundamentally trust them.

Related to the question - re: 21 million Cap
Source: 
*(Begin Quote)*
Here's a mathematical explanation:
Calculate the number of blocks per 4 year cycle:
* 6 blocks per hour
* 24 hours per day
* 365 days per year
* 4 years per cycle
= 210,240
~= 210,000
Sum all the block reward sizes:
50 + 25 + 12.5 + 6.25 + 3.125 + ... = 100
Multiply the two:
210,000 * 100 = 21 million.
Economically, because the currency is effectively infinitely divisible, then the precise amount doesn't matter, as long as the limit remains fixed.

No, they aren't "going away" as much as they'll catastrophically disappear. Banking "services" that you are accustomed to aren't going to hack it in the longer-term. In fact, an argument can be made that what we're witnessing with Trillions of negative interest rates on public/corporate debt instruments is the final death throes of capitalism itself.
But keep telling me how "normal" it is to offer negative rates on long term instruments, and how the G7/G20 aren't going to devalue their respective currencies at the expense of their neighbors economies.

The lipservice you are seeing about "blockchain" tech is only so they *seem* like they're on the ball, technology-wise. 
Actually committing funds to a full project or buying out the perceived competitor is only reserved for things they take seriously. Bitcoin and the blockchain isn't one of those things (yet).
Which is good, it means they're still blinded by "not invented here" syndrome, which will allow Bitcoin to lap them in the tech arena. By the time they wake up, it will be too late.

Some Ethereum Notes: *(By no means complete.)*
* There is no firm “upper cap” on Ethereum issuance, the schedule is 99 Million by 2025, 101 Million by 2128, and 104 Million by 5189.
* Storage requirements for the barely 2-year crypto-currency will approach 1,024 GB inside a year. (By comparison, Bitcoin is 8.5 years old and uses 126 GB).
* Ethereum mining supply is a huge overhang on the market. 26,205 ETH was mined in the last 24 hours compared to 1,838 BTC. This is approximately 14 times the rate, which must be absorbed by the Ethereum market every DAY to just maintain their current price.
* Of the total ~92.4 Million ether in existence, 60 Million were pre-mined for the “presale” and another 12 Million are controlled by the select centralized group doing development. That represents 77% sitting in very few hands compared to the outstanding float.
For those reasons and more, including lack of technical competence, Ethereum has a lot of obstacles to overcome before they can start gloating about taking away Bitcoin’s market share.
@_date: 2017-06-13 16:19:56

There will always be con-men and dudes like Cramer polluting the ecosystem. You learn to work around the insane claims to arrive at more pragmatic targets.
Also, Cramer's theory was that Bitcoin being used to pay off ransomware was the driving factor in its valuation. It isn't. The attackers of "WarCry" made less than $100,000 USD, representing a very small fraction (0.0012% of the European Bitcoin market) of the total volume trading in Bitcoin.

The only reason banks and financial firms are giving Bitcoin the cold shoulder in favor of "blockchain" is their tendency to not adopt outside tech they can't control.
By implementing their own "flavor" of shitty blockchain tech, they'll own the outcome and make yet-another-walled-garden where they can get fat and happy off of charging clients for the privilege.
So yes, fuck them. Fuck them up their stupid fucking faces.
Those attempts will fall flat after further inroads by Bitcoin. Then, eventually, and with much hand-wringing - and expense - they'll join the Bitcoin bandwagon because they won't have much of a fucking choice.
Which is fine, it allows the remaining ~4.5 million coins to be distributed to people who deserve them, instead of hoarded by a bunch of parasitic banking fucks.

At the current rate of growth, the storage requirements for the ETH blockchain will exceed 1 Terabyte by the end of the year.
