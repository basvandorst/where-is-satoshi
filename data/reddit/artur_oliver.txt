It's not about the coin technology. 
It's about Social Networks and tools to promote social interactions.
Since we are starting we can solve some issues that bitcoin has right now. It's experimental, but we have a great community to support it.
[This post should clarify some things](
Cheers mate!

If you don't understand the consequences of having all your information spied legally by a country you are dreaming with bitcoin being adopted in England.
Just because money laundering and tax avoidance will be the first evil allegation against. Easy Pizzy. Banks control Europe not people.
I'm serious! Europe will be next. France already approved [something]( .
Good days will come!
And that is a lot of people.

They want easy interface and simple use.
Lets see when bitcoin protocol delivers a simple method do call addresses more easier so that the Qr-code can vanish.

It will be today the last day to pass. They only give 3 days to house to decide and the people voting are out of this legislation.
So it seems to me that it's solid interest! The majority of people sited do not know what internet is and they don't care!
Money Money Money! £££££$$$$$€€€€€
Our cryptocurrencies could turn us into a terrorist just because they are against the system. Very very Easy!
Internet in evil hands is a very powerful tool. If legalized even worse.

In Ethereum people would need to learn a new programming language.
Altough the program runs across the whole network, better the program chooses the machines to witch they run every piece of it. (Ethereum)
In ZENNET the developer chooses the computer and the price where he wants to run the program. It's easier for developers to run code, but it doesn't create a decentralized entity inside the code that chooses in which machines to run each part of the code.
Ethereum has more free in essence because it allows for "code creatures" to live and rule inside the network. From the beginning to the end in Zennnet is a decentralized selling platform for cloud based services.
They could look the same but they aren't indeed! One is more frightening than the other.
