Exactly right. But the fact that people think wall street investors are going to be pouring into bitcoin because of futures creates a FOMO event that has an immense effect on the price of bitcoin. Futures may have a negligible effect on btc price, but the news of futures has a significant effect.

This is already parabolic. This is the effect of the futures we're seeing now. My guess is a few days before futures launch you'll see a lot of swing traders take profit and there will be a significant correction.
I'm also not convinced that big money investors aren't pumping the price now so they can tank it and short with futures. Though I have no evidence of this, call it a hunch.
This kind've parabolic rise is not sustainable in the short term. The longer it increases at this rate the bigger the correction will be. Not sure when it will happen, but it is inevitable.
Buy the dip, sell into strength if you're so inclined.

That is one of the factors that leads to a parabolic rise like this. Lots of new money. But that new money is inexperienced and emotional, and just as likely to dump going into the next dip.
Don't get me wrong, I am extremely bullish on bitcoin long term. We're going to get to 100k+ but it's not going to be a straight shot. There will be peaks and valleys. We're in a peak, and we're going to see a valley very soon.

I guess I'm giving the CME futures that launch on Dec 18th a little more weight here.
But you're right. I'm more or less expecting at least a minor correction by this weekend, with a larger one in the following week or so.

How's the mobile experience for either of those? I use coinbase because it's the easiest way I've found to buy and sell on my phone when I'm out and about.
I agree that the fees suck, but it feels like the convenience may be worth it
