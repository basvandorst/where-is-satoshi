Why don't you use a more popular and open source one ? Like Electrum
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:41:23
What? Can't you make one yourself? Would take at most 10 minutes
@_date: 2017-12-01 04:56:18
Electrum I'd say
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:55:01
That 300 wall got ripped appart in seconds
@_date: 2017-12-09 07:21:46
OP delivered!
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:41:53
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:59:50
Or do it just at the right moment.
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:27:56
Too soon man. Too soon

Transfer your coins to an exchange and withdraw
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:08:07
Moon was 10k
@_date: 2017-12-01 05:13:58
If you are from Canada use QuadrigaCX. 1.5% fee using interact online when buying
@_date: 2017-12-09 07:20:54
Wasn't it like 180k during bcash attack?
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:33:56
Number of inputs and outputs make the size of the transaction. Not the amount of BTC. A 10 BTC transaction could be smaller than a 0.001 BTC one.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:16:56
What? It went over 80,000 on GDAX last week
@_date: 2017-11-19 01:51:21
It means you can send transactions with a  10-20 sat/B ($0.15-0.20 for a regular transaction) fee and be confirmed with the next block mined.
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:34:05
9675 now!
@_date: 2017-11-01 16:55:51
Might be a pool that closed or some kind of loss of hashrate and the difficult had not yet ajusted to that
@_date: 2017-11-01 16:51:32
I'm afraid it's going to back down to 4000 after the fork.
@_date: 2017-11-01 11:30:57
8600 this morning on Quadriga!
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:50:28
@_date: 2017-11-16 00:24:18
Instead of buying for 10,000$ straight, you buy 1,000 every week for 10 weeks. Something like that
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:21:04
private address? or sweep
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:45:34
This may? Cause a slight dip. Could be a good time to buy before going 8k+
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:33:39
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:36:10
Get out. Not even using a Segwit address
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:10:54
what website is this?
@_date: 2017-11-06 14:25:42
Wait for the fork
@_date: 2017-11-12 03:40:29
Bigger blocks is only a temporary patch. We need long term scaling solutions.
@_date: 2017-11-23 17:32:46
That's your bank
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:41:20
Segwit2x canceled
@_date: 2017-11-02 00:30:37
That's not how any of this works!
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:56:01
Because BCH price jumped and it became more profitable to mine than BTC
@_date: 2017-11-19 02:21:04


i thought it would get dropped from the mempool after 3 days?
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:59:17
Are you Roger Ver?
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:46:03
Thank you!
@_date: 2017-11-06 14:26:15
Assuming it will fall to 6k ����
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:45:13
Great argument!
@_date: 2017-11-07 01:16:35
Because you own and control the private keys with a wallet
@_date: 2017-10-23 22:38:26
@_date: 2017-10-19 02:56:27
It's 158,000 though which could be worth 1 billion soon
@_date: 2017-10-23 22:23:23
@_date: 2017-10-24 00:58:59
probably tied to your private key, which you can import in a BTG wallet? I'm just guessing
@_date: 2017-10-23 18:30:19
Fork happening in about 50 blocks (500 min) transactions on the mempool are through the roof right now. Good luck.
@_date: 2017-10-23 22:26:24
look the at the mempool, there are 20,000 transactions waiting to be confirmed
@_date: 2017-10-28 03:18:53
I use Quadriga. They're pretty nice. Free withdrawals. Only downside is 0.5% trading fee and no alt coins except ETH and LTC
@_date: 2017-10-20 16:46:45
It's what I'm doing.
@_date: 2017-10-22 01:28:26
@_date: 2017-10-24 00:47:17
low input/low output, less satoshis/byte
@_date: 2017-10-18 07:09:12
Do you think day trading is gambling? I've not had success doing it
@_date: 2017-10-23 20:04:29
It literally says that the order does not matter
@_date: 2017-10-19 23:58:24
Doing the same!
@_date: 2017-10-22 01:53:22
Which exchange is this?
@_date: 2017-10-23 22:22:34
You can try with a high fee
