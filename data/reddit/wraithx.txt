There is plenty of room - come on over!

Something isn't right here.  I am currently dealing with a project with one of (if not THE) most sought after design companies right now and the project is large but not anywhere near a million - low to mid six figures.
The company he is using "slickage studios" is pretty new and doesn't even have their own website.

Profit is after expenses - he probably draws a rather large salary as a business expense leaving $0 profits.

Surely the company must still pass the GST on to the government which, if they were 100% selling in BTC would require them to cash some out to pay that. The GST component of the price can still be factored in to the final BTC price.

You can do that here too - I just don't see a justification for that amount of money up front.

I had a quote for an off-grid solar powered system for my home here in NZ: $70,000 - not a very cheap option given my monthly power bill only costs $230 (it would take roughly 25 years of free power to pay for itself).

I know where my next holiday is going to be!

Why? "You aren't anyone's dad."
@_date: 2013-12-01 20:20:24
I agree - you should definitely sell! I am just going to wait for it to go to double digits to buy everything you sell!

May I as how you are in a position to deal in bitcoins when the rest of your village barely has water?  Are you the mayor?

Give the kid a beer - it's not going to kill him for god's sake! Americans and their ridiculous fear of alcohol!

It's just slow - happens all the time.  It will clear in 9 mins or so.

Yes that is true - though surely general policy in a European bank (combining retail and investment) would be set from above by a small group...
Edited to say: I upvoted you because I am not trying to argue - just trying to understand it with more clarity.
@_date: 2013-11-30 07:08:53
I came here to say the very same thing! Ridiculous.  More like "profit commission"

Hmm - that's the feast of St Aloysius Gonzaga - an aristocratic Jesuit...

Rabobank is European - non-US banks don't have to follow US bank rules so there is every chance that they are allowed to operate as one bank.

I gave you mine to use...

I hope your returns were higher than consumer goods inflation (of 10+%) - if not, you did lose.

How did you know my partner was gender neutral?! 
@_date: 2013-12-01 18:38:18
Ah - thanks for replying.  Good on you!

I have bought all my coins through localbitcoins.  If you start a transaction and talk to the guy (give a mobile number) he may be willing to let you just do bank transactions. I have not met anyone from the site - just spoken on the phone then done instant bank transfers direct in exchange the coins.

Marie Antoinette never said that.  Rousseau did in a book he wrote about a privileged princess (written when Marie was around 5 years old in fact).  Queen Marie was, in fact, very concerned about the plight of the poor and was a good honest lady. [Read More.](

I am making sure that none of my bank payments for anything related to bitcoin mention the words bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-01 20:29:06
I just bought $500 worth.  If it drops again I will keep doing so.

I was seeing it more as tagging it to a person famous for a particular occupation relating to money and the French revolution...

It never makes sense to spread mistruth.

I am doing the same for one member of my family and her husband - they are in IT so I am hoping it will be an appreciated gift.
@_date: 2013-12-01 18:45:35
I presumed it was relevant because you said it.  Surely you should be pleased that you now know that you won't misattribute that quote in future...

Upturned hat on the street works best...

I think the many signs of an impending economic collapse are making many people think about money a lot more lately.  Your story is exactly the same as mine except I started out buying gold and silver - all my savings went to it. Now I am also including bitcoin in my investments.  I am avoiding the markets completely so for me Au, Ag, and BTC seem to be the safest way to diversify right now.
@_date: 2013-11-30 07:47:58
I'm buying the shit out of the thing!  But I did spent $200 US buying silver from another redditor today.
@_date: 2013-11-30 05:25:49
I would too! But on the 21st of September :)
@_date: 2013-11-30 05:31:30
Great idea! Don't forget Bitcoin Day on the 21st of September though :)
