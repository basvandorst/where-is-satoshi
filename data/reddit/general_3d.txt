Took me about a day of randomly reciting it to myself to memorize and burn mine. Here's hoping I don't suffer a TBI or alzheimers!

Spend the same amount of money every time you buy over a long period of time. When the price is high, you don't buy a lot of bitcoin. When it's low, you're getting more for your money. It really does bring down your average cost a lot, in most circumstances. If you google it, you should find some good examples.  
It's a very smart method of investing over time. It protects you from FOMO and FUD too, which is nice.
