Without a doubt there will be a nice dip coming sometime soon.  But here’s the problem...
It’s 12,000 now.   Let’s say it goes up to 15,000 this week. Then sheds 2000.   That’s a pretty big dip, lots of people will buy in.   However, that dip will get you in at 13,000.   1,000 over what you could buy in for right now.  
On the other hand, you could buy in right now and guess what?   Here comes that dip.   Drops us down to 10,000.  You just lost 2,000
So bottom line.  No one can tell you how to invest it.  Statistically, if you want the best risk/reward you’re better off dollar cost averaging it over a 3-6 month period.   
Either way.    Good luck to you!

Only way to avoid the tax (I’m not 100% sure.  Would have to do some research) would be to donate the bitcoin to a charity.  For this to even have the possibility of working it would have to be BTC donation, not a USD donation. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:28:55
This is still a horrible idea.   Didn’t you post this yesterday with the same response?
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:23:53
If you move to paperwallet be cautious.    Best bet is to use an airgapped computer ( one that is not, and has never been online).  If a computer you used to print off the paperwallet was infected with malware, that paperwallet could be compromised.  
Bitcoin still isn’t mainstream friendly.  Congrats on being lucky and early.  Good luck to you!

No one is going to make anyone split the bitcoins.  The value of your joint property is X dollars.  She is probably entitled to .5X dollars.  If you keep 100% of the bitcoin it’s usually not a problem so long as she still ends up with .5X dollars at the end of the day.  
Worst case scenario, splitting the BTC in half does have fees and right now they are high, but the cost is hardly restrictive if that’s what needs to be done.

No. It does not.

Mines coins are subject to self employment tax.  The rest is taxed as capital gains (long or short depending on the holding period).  As far as I know, coinbase doesn't report the shift card transactions to the IRS, but they very well could at one point.     Either way, you're responsible for filing the taxes and reporting the income (well, in this case your brother is)
How much of a tax are we talking about?   No idea.   Could be 0 could be thousands.   All depends on the amount of gains and the length of time it was held. 
@_date: 2017-08-28 02:36:18
Incorrect.   Like kind exchange would not apply to this type of transaction.  Check IRS section 1031 for more information. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 02:54:14
Coinbase is probably the easiest.  As you know very well, get it out of the exchange when you can.  
As far as wallets, there are plenty. Personally I use breadwallet for iOS.

Depends on the size of the transaction.   With bitcoin you send the history of your transaction.  It depends how big that history is for the 1bitcoin.

Breadwallet here.   Once I accumulate half a bitcoin (used to be 1) I move it to a paper wallet. 
Recently bought a nano ledger s.  Waiting for shipping.  But that'll be nice. 
@_date: 2017-08-21 04:40:53
A quick google search came up with this. 
Looks like average wait time is a couple days.  Might not be a txid yet because they may not have sent the funds yet.  
@_date: 2017-08-25 02:32:06
Just keep in mind, iirc seed words didn't come out until 2012ish.   If the wallet is older than that you can't restore those words like a seed.  There's another way to do it.  Google search will probably help.

Wrong address.   The person is lying.  The person is incompetent. 
If the blockchain says that address has it then that address has it.  Not much else can be done.  Maybe they need to rescan the blockchain with whatever wallet they're using?

I'm not as harsh as some of these guys.   In my opinion it is NOT a scam.   They are pretty clear what the costs etc are.   
That being said, unless difficulty drops (which I be never seen) your probably not gonna make any money.    And more likely lose some. 
Source: didn't do any research when I 1st started and bought a small contract.   To date I've recovered about 35% of my coins.  If returns continue down the path they have been I expect to recover about 60% before the contract bottoms out.  
@_date: 2017-08-11 13:54:04
excel sheet?  piece of paper?  
You'll need a list of all the purchases and all the sales.  You'll need some kind of backup proving those purchases and sales actually happened... a bank statement and screen print?  something that will backup what you are claiming.
You're responsible to report every sale, and/or transfer between crypto.

Coinbase.  You will be forced to disclose personal information.  Name social license etc etc.   
Buylocalbitcoin.com (might have the site wrong, but it's something like that). Expect to pay a premium.   Buy off another person with no personal information exchanged.  You'll need to setup a wallet to accept the funds.  Breadwallet for iOS is good.   Can't suggest any android wallets.

Blockfolio on iOS.

Multisig wallet where you'd have to sign off?   
Only options I can think of.  
@_date: 2017-08-21 04:47:31
Pretty much.   In reality it'd probably be more like 40-60 minutes to get enough confirmations to use the funds.  
If they're sent with really low miners fees it could take hours.   I think your issue here is they haven't actually sent it yet.  They should generate that transaction ID once they do.  
@_date: 2017-08-06 13:08:19
I'm just waiting for Komodo wallet to sync, but I'll update as soon as it's done to confirm.  thanks again Komodo blockchain explorer seems to be down. will update as soon as its up or my wallet receives it, whichever comes first.

You'll disclose it to coinbase.   Then transfer the funds to a wallet (which doesn't disclose anything)
@_date: 2017-08-21 00:16:07
What is it you want to mine?    If it's bitcoin the answer is no.   Not without investing a couple thousand at minimum and having cheap electricity. 
If it's alt coins.  Maybe.   Easiest method is to check out nicehash.   They'll do all the setting up etc for you. 
You can also look into mining ether, or zcash or whatever directly.   Those will require a little bit of research on your part.  Nothing too difficult.  
For both nicehash and direct mining you'll need a decent video card.  Nicehash has a profitability calculator you can search.  
@_date: 2017-08-23 11:24:07
More than likely it'll be 0.  All depends on how much of a gain we're talking about.  
Most tax offices will let you drop off your documents and they'll see if you need to file.

This is probably under reported.  Schedule D where you claim the gains asks for a description of the asset that was sold.  It would be very easy to report the taxable gain but not be very descriptive of the asset. i.e $500 gain and use the description of “coinbase” or “crypto” or “assets” really could put anything remotely close in the description and still file a valid tax return.  
@_date: 2017-09-22 10:54:47

Bartering induces income tax.  
Crypto to crypto is currently taxable.   There is a bill in the works that could change that.  But at the moment it is fully taxable.  
@_date: 2017-09-22 13:53:15
possibly... depends on how long you held the coins before you bought them... could be subject to long term capital gains, which may not even be taxable to you... all dependent on how much and your other income.  Not too hard to estimate if you have a tax preparer who has access to your 2016 tax returns.
@_date: 2017-09-03 00:22:05

Technically you report the transaction and claim nominee and issue your friend a 1099.

No. If it was a valid address it was sent and cannot be unsent. 
Now the good news...  you have multiple receiving addresses.  If you copied and pasted it correctly and he copied and pasted it correctly it’ll be fine.  Just a matter of time.  Get the transaction ID so you can look it up.

Where do you see the 1st?
From their website:
How can I get Bitcoin Gold?
The Bitcoin Gold (BTG) initial coin distribution method is exactly the same as that used by Bitcoin Cash (BCH). All Bitcoin holders who possess BTC private keys on October 25 (block 491 407) will receive Bitcoin Gold on the rate of 1 BTC = 1 BTG (If you have 20 BTC you will receive 20 BTG). You need to control BTC private keys in order to make Bitcoin Gold transactions.

Don’t have the link handy on mobile ATM but there are 2 pieces of “evidence”  that I’m aware of.  
1.  An IRS letter (not tax law) that specifically says it. 
2.  A current bill that was submitted for vote that specifically asks to make a change for record keeping purposes that would make it non taxable. 
@_date: 2017-09-16 12:55:30
Please don’t listen to this.  I don’t care if someone says they refuse to claim it, but trade for other coin, goods, services, etc are all taxable events.

Your free to report or not report whatever transactions you’d like.  This is the proper method.

Yup.  Gotta transfer money now if you plan on buying next week :)
@_date: 2017-05-31 00:01:16
You do need to contact your bank ASAP though.  Good luck
@_date: 2017-05-27 17:07:56
Yup.  Whether or not they should, the IRS does treat each transaction as a capital gain or loss. Because you've disclosed to the bank exactly where this income came from, is be sure to report something to them. Doubt it would ever come to light, but I'd rather report something and not worry about a future fraud charge for deliberately not reporting.  
@_date: 2017-05-31 19:41:07
Are you taking a huge risk?  probably not.
you are not permitted to just lump everything together and take it as 1 transaction in whatever year you feel like.  Each transaction is subject to taxation in the year in which it happens.  Sometimes it doesnt make a difference... sometimes it does...
The problem is that the letter of the law and real life don't always coincide.  In case of an audit, there is a human on the other side and they will sometimes let things go one way or another for the sake of simplicity and the IRS getting their money quicker.  If you happened to get audited and the agent assigned to you wanted to, he could make sure every i was dotted and t crossed.  
We're talking about a few thousand, usually not worth the IRS's time to get too involved, but who's to say... I would never give anyone advice saying its not a big deal, because for all I know some agent may decide to make it a big deal.
The code is pretty clear on this matter.
TLDR:  We're not talking about a lot of money... more than likely the IRS will be fine with whatever you do.  But... the code is clear and there are definite ways for it to be done.
@_date: 2017-05-31 21:49:42
Each transaction is taxable regardless whether or not you ever withdraw from coinbase. 
Losses may be deductible so long as you don't have another purchase 30 days before or after. 
@_date: 2017-05-29 16:18:56
Yes they can be used for physical purchases so long as the vendor accepts them.  
For US based people, yes taxes apply to each selling of bitcoin.  For other countries who knows.  
@_date: 2017-05-27 22:38:26
No problem.   You won't be sent any paperwork from Gemini.   You will be on your own to fill out IRS form 8949 and report date purchased, date sold, cost basis and saws price. 
@_date: 2017-05-30 01:38:11
You be subject to capital gains tax.   The rate would depend on how long you held the coins as well as your tax rate.   Could be 0% 10% 15% or more.  
The taxable portion would be on the gains like you mention. 
@_date: 2018-04-07 02:18:56
Remind me “bitcoin 20k”
Let’s see who wins...
@_date: 2017-07-03 11:32:10
Depends on the size of the transaction and the number of pending transactions and how fast you need it. 
100 sat/byte will get your transaction completed, but 300 will get it done quicker. 
@_date: 2017-05-30 01:53:50
Exactly.  Only the gain would be taxable.   
You will be responsible to keep track of the amount purchased and the date.   As well as the amount sold and the date. 
The gain or loss is what will become taxable income.  
@_date: 2017-05-30 00:02:28
Like previously stated, not necessary but highly recommended.  I'd want control of the private key.  Breadwallet or something similar.  
@_date: 2017-05-30 23:51:08
You'll be fine.   Might take some time but you'll be OK
@_date: 2017-05-27 21:14:24
Create an account on Gemini or coinbase.  Just watch the price for awhile and see how much fluctuation there is.  (It can be very volatile). When your ready pull the trigger and purchase a small amount say $100 USD or so. Maybe setup dollar cost averaging and invest $50 a month or something like that.  
Once you have a few bucks invested you can transfer into an offline wallet like breadwallet for iOS but you can cross that bridge later.   I'm still new myself, but fee free to send me a PM if ya have any questions.  
@_date: 2017-05-31 15:54:59
I think its always a good idea to diversify, I just don't like the idea of chasing gains
@_date: 2017-05-27 03:00:01
Don't forget about the IRS.   They want their share of those gains as well. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 20:31:10
Pretty sure at this point it would be a prohibited transaction.   Soon though.  Soon
@_date: 2017-07-16 12:10:46
Not exactly sure how that's an illusion.   That's exactly how marketcap works.  FMV x number of coins or shares etc etc.

@_date: 2017-05-30 10:34:21
Have you reported sales in the past to the IRS?  Might help with proof.   Might even want to go back and amend your returns to show some.  
If you need it for loan/mortgage purposes I don't think that's going to be enough.
Good luck.  Keep us updated.

Where can you find a website that's giving away USD for free?  
Plenty of ways you can earn some BTC but they all require some sort of investment on your end.

And you need it tonight?    Not gonna happen.  
1.  You can sign up for an exchange and purchase it there.  No problem but will take a few days.  
2.  Buy it from someone locally there's a website but I forgot it ATM.  You'll pay a bit of a premium but could be done same day.  
3. Find someone online who will sell it to you and face a pretty high chance of getting scammed.  Plus pay a premium for their hassle.  
@_date: 2017-05-31 19:13:02
The IRS is actually pretty clear right now with buying/selling bitcoins...  They are treated just like stocks.
When you purchase bitcoin, that is your cost.  when you sell you are subject to capital gains tax on any gains recognized.  (could be Long or Short term depending on the holding period)
If you sell at a loss, you can claim that loss as a capital loss so long as you did not repurchase bitcoin with a 30 day window before or after.  If that's the case that's considered a Wash Sale and that loss is added to your basis.
Unfortunately the statute of limitations for claiming a refund is 3 years, which means If you are due a refund from 4 years ago thats gone.
Toughest part is calculating a basis if you've been dollar cost averaging.  that can be an issue... 
Thats about it for general info... I can answer something specific if ya have anymore questions...

Based on my experience I'd say no.  I don't think you'll find a concrete answer in any IRS code but there are other examples (IRA Rollovers to name one) where making an exchange that type of exchange would not be a taxable event.  Now, if you didn't do it immediately, or went into another crypto that would be taxable for sure.

So long as you are able to be verified, coinbase and Gemini sell at market value.  Worse case I'm sure you could find someone to buy from at a small premium. 
@_date: 2017-07-11 01:17:01
I couldn't read your whole post.   I get you don't like taxes.  No one does.  But your logic seem a bit flawed.  1.   Crypto is not subject to property tax nor sales tax.  
Your relation to foreign income is a bit off.  If I buy CAD or a rupee or whatever other foreign currency any gains or loss due to currency fluctuation is also taxable.  
I agree with ya on 1 point.  Paying taxes sucks.

This is not a taxable event. It has nothing to do with not being converted to USD (transactions can still be taxable even if you never convert to fiat). 
This would be treated like a stock split.  You'll have to adjust your basis, but at this point it's not taxable. 
@_date: 2017-07-11 22:13:54
I don't have the actual numbers handy.  But if you have no other income and are just reporting long term capital gain (BTC were held for more than a year) and its only a couple coins, more than likely you will have a 0% tax.  
@_date: 2017-07-23 12:26:33
Get veracrypt, encrypt a copy and put it one Dropbox, onedrive or something like that.  Gotta balance security and convenience.  IMO this is a balance between the two. 
@_date: 2017-07-18 03:46:03
It would be considered cost of sale.  It would reduce your taxable gain.  
On a side note, the miner would pay tax on receiving it.  So the govt still gets their fair share.  
@_date: 2017-07-10 02:28:02
in MA I could point ya in the right direction, but any younger CPA willing to do a little research would be able to take care of you.  
It's really not much more difficult than dealing with most other investments or schedule C if your mining.

There are 2 parts to nicehash.  
1 People who want to sell their hashing power.  Your GPU will mine for someone else.  
2 People who want to buy hashing power.   Whoever wants to pay the most will rent hashing power from the pool of seller.  Price fluctuates based on demand.

Recently downloaded jaxx for etherium and really liking it.  Control of miner fees actually being able to see my private key and exchanging for other crypto

It would be the same as trading 1 mutual fund for another.  Never went into cash but a taxable event none the less
@_date: 2017-06-13 01:49:16
Side note.  Most audits happen years later.   There is a 3 year statute, but if you never reported it, it could be considered fraudulent and carry an unlimited statute.  
So...  just cause one hasn't been audited YET doesn't mean much.  
@_date: 2017-07-18 11:34:13
No.  You can convert the cost to USD equivalent.
You can't report that expense when moving your own funds around on the chain YET.   If you buy 1 USD worth of bitcoin and pass it around to ourself a few times the miners fees will drop the value down to .90 worth of BTC.   At this point you sell it and have a .10 loss.  The fees you pay will eventually be deducted.  It may not be separately stated as an expense of sale, but it is reflected in your final BTC value.

Ummm.   Probably.   Maybe.  Who knows.   Wouldn't be the 1st exchange to lose your bitcoins.  
Safer to hold the keys yourself and not worry about them holding it.  
@_date: 2017-06-01 23:47:22
To buy yes.  I'd transfer them out of there once purchased though. But to buy coinbase/Gemini both work.   Ask a friend for a referral link so you both get $10

Nicehash will earn you about $4 per day gross.  Gotta subtract out your electricity expense and you'll probably net $3 or so per day.  
@_date: 2017-06-14 00:23:33
You bough ETH at $200.  "Sold" or disposed of it when the price was $300.  You'd be responsible for paying the capital gain on the $100 gain. 
Your basis on the new coin would be $300 and used to calculate future capital gain/loss when you dispose of that holding. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 10:21:00
Based on everything I know about how the IRS treats any other transaction it's a taxable event.  It seems to be fairly clear 
: How is virtual currency treated for federal tax purposes?A-1: For federal tax purposes, virtual currency is treated as property. General tax principles applicable to property transactions apply to transactions using virtual currency.
-6: Does a taxpayer have gain or loss upon an exchange of virtual currency for other property?A-6: Yes. If the fair market value of property received in exchange for virtual currency exceeds the taxpayer’s adjusted basis of the virtual currency, the taxpayer has taxable gain. The taxpayer has a loss if the fair market value of the property received is less than the adjusted basis of the virtual currency. See Publication 544, Sales and Other Dispositions of Assets, for information about the tax treatment of sales and exchanges, such as whether a loss is deductible
@_date: 2017-06-15 15:55:55
A lot of uncertainty right now.  Could make some decent change if you hold through it.  Or you could lose a good portion/all of it.  
Good news is your downside is limited, but upside is unlimited.  Don't "invest" what you can't afford to lose.  
@_date: 2017-06-22 20:51:23
Only one is look into is nicehash.  But do some research 1st. 
@_date: 2017-06-17 14:03:06
For USA that's a taxable event.  There's no legal way around it.  
@_date: 2017-07-23 17:41:38
Generally speaking stock spin offs are also tax free.  Again just need to adjust your basis. 
@_date: 2017-06-18 15:08:18
Defiantly visit a tax guy and an investment guy.   You need to diversify that.  Way too much risk holding it all in crypto.  
My advice would be to sell off at least 60% of that and diversify into mutual funds, or property or something else that interests you.

@_date: 2017-06-03 00:09:37
Generally speaking.  If it's too good to be true.  It probably isn't.  
Everything we do comes with a risk/reward ratio.   The higher the risk, the higher the possible returns/losses.  
More than likely your friend is embellishing his story a bit.  If he is telling the truth he took on a big risk of losing plenty.  
@_date: 2017-06-14 19:41:23
Put about $200 in a few weeks ago before I read up on it.  So far received back 10% of my investment (10% of the BTC not $ since the fluctuation in price will distort that).

There are exchanges that you can sell bitcoin on.   Coinbase or kraken are an example.   At 12.5 you won't be able to do that without parents help.  Localbitcoin will allow you to sell to others in person, but I would t recommend that at 12.5.  
As far as getting bitcoin, there's really no easy free way of doing it.  You mentioned the only ways.  Get off your lazy 12.5 ass and get a job!   
Seriously though your not gonna be able to do much without parents help.  Maybe in exchange for some chores etc etc they'll help you get setup.

Price, the way I understand it is driven by supply and demand.  If demand drops off price will drop and you'll make some money.  If your overpaying for your hashpower you'll lose money.
Gotta do your research and see what the sweet spot for price is.  I mean some buyers are making money somewhere or else there would t be any demand for us sellers. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 13:22:25
No idea how much you sent, but it seems to be well established that right now fees are high.  
@_date: 2017-06-29 12:46:23
hmmm... ya... that'll show them... 
when your done throwing a hissy fit they accept checks or credit cards (for a fee).  Whichever is better for you... If you want to sell some BTC to pay the taxes that works as well, just remember to pay the tax on those gains the following year as well.
@_date: 2017-06-27 16:32:37
This has bad news written all over it... you'll have access to their private key.  They don't want to provide identification for the purchase.
I'd point them in the right direction and let them do it.  If they don't have enough knowledge/want to lean to do it themselves its probably better off they're not in bitcoin
This doesn't pass the smell test. 
@_date: 2017-06-10 14:10:54
For US based, yes.  That is a taxable event subject to capital gains.  No question about it.

There is no sales tax on it.  It's treated as property for taxation.  Like a mutual fund.   There are no property taxes on mutual funds.  Your are subject only to capital gains tax.  (With the exception of if you are mining, on which case you'd be subject to ordinary income and self employment tax).

@_date: 2017-06-14 00:01:32
Trading into a different coin is a taxable event.  Like kind exchanges wouldn't apply to this.

Crypto is treated very similarly to stocks or mutual funds.

Plotted out the returns in an excel sheet.  Based on the trend line it will expire at right around that return.  Keep in mind I've only had it a couple weeks.

In my experience Gemini and coinbase are always cheaper than localbitcoins.   Problem is you need to be verified for both coinbase and Gemini.   I guess that's the trade off.

Watched the video.  Pretty impressive.
The video is referring to the stats of hacking a particular address.   Any idea what would happen if everyone on the planet had an average of 20 private keys?   What would be the chance of randomly rolling any one of these addresses?

Yes.   You have to report the date.   How much it cost to buy.  How much you redeemed it for and the date.   And then subject to tax on any gains between those 2 numbers.  Even if Loss or no gain your still required.
