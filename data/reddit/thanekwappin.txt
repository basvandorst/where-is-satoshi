Awesome! Thanks!
I have a hardware wallet and wanted to know before the Super Bitcoin fork (and apparently there are a few others) I don't necessarily care for them but hey free coins. I'll take some time and read through the bitcoinairdrops sub and get a bit more info on them. Thanks again!

Ah this is perfect! Thank you for the information! 
I didn't yet have my coins on a hard wallet before BCash and I moved my coins to Ledger Nano last month and saw the whole Super Bitcoin (and others if they're real -
 Uranium, Silver, GOD?) and wanted to see how and if we would receive coins of those forks. Not that I care for them but it would be useful to know and sell them if need be.
I'll take some time and read through that sub and make sure I'm secure and have some more knowledge before then. Thanks again!

Awesome thanks!
I didn't know much about forks since I got in just after Bcash but I'll be sure to study up on them!

I feel like at this point in the future they will have rechargeable batteries based on either coil tech ( if that stuff gets small enough you never need to charge anything again. and then this too (

Just opened the app and clicked “learn more” on their pop up about buy/sells being disabled. I scrolled through and what do you know BTC, ETH &amp; LTC “degrades service” BCH “operational”

Haha amazing! I just got back from a trip to Cuba. When I bought the tickets my SO sent me a payment for the flights since I threw them on my CC and she put the message as "!Vamos a Cuba!" and they held up the transaction for review. We didn't get an email but they held the payment for 2 days to "review" it. Interesting as that was the first time I experienced it.

It keeps looking not level on the wall and it upsets me and then it seems level and I like it, vicious circle
