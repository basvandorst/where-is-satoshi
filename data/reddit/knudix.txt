If you add the router settings you are already top 11750 in the world ��
Edit: You need around 150gb free HDD

I read that after posting. I'll try at my own risk tomorrow, and promise not to bug the developers if I fail.. :D
@_date: 2018-01-27 01:09:34
I say its a stretch. After the desember run we had I would be happy we reach 30k after the correction. Though I'd love you to prove me wrong!
@_date: 2018-01-26 23:36:18
I would never trust an unsigned app. I hope they resolve this soon.
@_date: 2018-01-27 01:41:04
What a time to be alive!
@_date: 2018-01-26 23:48:43
Happy for you! I hope this is a taste of what is to be!
@_date: 2018-01-27 00:55:36
True. I don't say we should not have alternate paths. (which is the beauty of Lightning). But lets plan for the common case and still have options for disasters. Not the other way around ;)
Is 4-10 hops in disaster mode something we even have to worry about?
@_date: 2018-01-27 01:23:42
Then again: As a law abiding citizen. Is anonymity that important? Say we have an option for anonymous transactions: ZCash / Monero etc. 
I'd say: Let bitcoin relax their requirements on anonymity and focus on scale / microtransactions. And let the privacy coins deal with anonymity. 
@_date: 2018-01-27 01:43:22
Glad to be ripping! :D

Lightning has gone from 50 -&gt; 250 nodes in a week. I say buckle up ⚡️
@_date: 2018-01-27 00:48:20
I get your point in theory.
However: In my world 90% of my peers have an active subscription to Spotify. If they acted as a supernode I would be able to transfer funds to most of my peers with 2 hops. If one additional peer [isp, power, phone company] served as an optional route I would say that would cover me 99%. Sure I could need different routes, but this I'd say would be mostly theoretical. 
One point being: I don't need to be able to reach _any_ node with minimum hops. I need to reach _my_ peers with minimum hops.
@_date: 2018-01-27 01:34:16
I think you have to separate anonymity from control. 
Bitcoin offers a currency with no institutional control but anonymity is just a semi boon. Sure you can have both in other coins. But that is not the issue with BTC
@_date: 2018-01-27 00:27:56
Can you elaborate why centralisation is so bad? As long as we have trustless channels with the option of routing around bad actors - I don't see why naturally formed supernodes are so bad? I would say we all benefit from it.
@_date: 2018-01-27 01:36:13
What about lightning? ⚡️
We are up 500% nodes in _one_ week. This is happening!
@_date: 2018-01-27 00:38:19
I was more like: What is coincheck?
@_date: 2018-01-27 01:30:10
I appreciate you being as drunk as me! 
Nvidia got the gaming business by the balls by now, and AMD is struggling to keep up. Sure they could be dabbling into ASIC mining but to what end?
They already sell all their cards at 20% premium to the marked for mining. They are in the best weather they've ever been. 
For the first time in history it really makes sense to buy a high end gaming card - because you can sell the power back to the marked when you are not using it. I see no reason why not to just focus on the next gen gaming cards and let bitmain do whatever they do.. Everyone wins..
@_date: 2018-01-27 01:15:28
Privacy: What you do is what you get. If you reuse addresses then at some point you could be tracked.
Supply: Bitcoin today is deflationary. This could change in the future if deemed necessary. Inflation is one tool to stimulate circulation. I say crypto _and_ bitcoin needs some kind of tools to react to global economics. But the best part about crypto::code is that it can be changed as we go. If everyone HODL and no-one spends a dime everything will crash in the end..
@_date: 2018-01-26 23:34:26
As long as people just stake money they are willing to lose this must be good! I for one would like to get my hands on a lightning sticker from Blockstream!
@_date: 2018-01-27 00:51:29
That is a given. We are making history here!
@_date: 2018-01-27 00:30:14
I'll look into this for a main net test! Reading the docs I promise not to bug the developers! :p
@_date: 2018-01-27 00:59:35
Download bitcoin core: bitcoin.org
Passive mode: run it and sync the blockchain
Active mode: (sharing with other nodes) open port 8333 in your router.
@_date: 2018-08-01 21:27:34
I'm running a VM with bitcoin core installed via the package manager and LND installed from source. I'd say it was medium to difficult to set up if you are not to well versed in linux. A prebuilt VM might be a lot easier if you trust the maker. Configuration is pretty straight forward and the devs on Slack are very helpfull!

@_date: 2018-08-01 20:08:39
No worries! I’d say the main real world improvement with LN other than conserving block space is instant transactions ��
@_date: 2018-08-01 19:21:59
I did that a week ago when I discovered they had a node
@_date: 2018-05-22 08:47:30
I have a virtual image running Ubuntu. 
Then “just install” bitcoin core and Lnd. Their documentation is pretty good. 
However if you are not so savvy with the command line, then I’d wait for a more mature wallet.
@_date: 2018-05-22 05:19:17
Haven’t played much the last years but topped out around 4,5k ��️‍♂️
@_date: 2018-05-21 19:55:03
Yeah, they did. But you can buy vouchers for the Steam store from Bitrefill!
@_date: 2018-05-22 16:22:03
I can’t wait! ��
@_date: 2018-08-01 19:52:21
Heh, I'm not saying this is very user friendly yet. However now I have a properly funded channel, so the next time I want to spend some I probably don't have to open a new channel.
@_date: 2018-08-01 19:19:03
Aye! Though so far I’ve done more lightning payments than contact less card payments.  Adoption takes time.. ��
@_date: 2018-08-02 07:04:29
I guess the customers are the ones presenting liquid channels. I wonder if they will close the channel to “release” the funds, or if it will stay open!
@_date: 2019-06-29 10:04:53
It’s blocked in my country :-( Know any countries that’s available?
@_date: 2019-06-29 08:35:55
I had hoped to catch some of the talks over the weekend..
@_date: 2019-06-29 08:20:48
Anyone know if they filmed the talks from Bitcoin 2019?
@_date: 2019-06-29 09:54:02
Great ��

@_date: 2019-04-04 18:15:06
Crypto marked share is a very bloated number. A 20M buy or sell easily adds or shaves off 200M marked cap. Lightning cap is hard numbers. No bloat. 
@_date: 2019-04-05 19:44:26
Neutrino is already on testnet. And I believed Zap is preparing for running as an iOS light node. So I’m more optimistic!
@_date: 2019-04-03 06:09:18
Until recently backing up your node impractical. So there was a high probability of losing funds in the case of hardware failure. This has kept me from increasing my node’s funds. However, static channel backups was just merged to master which adds a way to recover from hardware failure!
@_date: 2019-04-19 20:54:15
Zap for iOS! Built from source so I can tinker with it ��‍��
@_date: 2019-04-03 19:21:08
For now dm him on the LND Slack, or send him an email. 
I don’t like to post others emails publicly. You can pm me for it��
@_date: 2019-04-05 19:24:27
The lightning wallets are just not ready yet for people not running a node. The network is maturing and lightning light wallets _will_ be a thing in 2019. 
We have taken great leaps forward but they are mostly building infrastructure required for the next killer app. 
@_date: 2019-04-04 19:19:27
If you just want to try it out: Blue Wallet (though it’s custodial) or you’ll have to run your own node. Hopefully neutrino isn’t that far away. It’s in beta.
@_date: 2019-04-03 06:12:56
Alex Bosworth sends out a ~weekly email with updates from LND. It’s pretty technical,  but I like it!
@_date: 2019-04-05 17:45:16
I disagree. It’s all about choice. I can choose convenience and trusting someone else, or I can run my own node and trust no one. I’d say it’s much better for a new users to try a custodial wallet today than not play with lightning at all for the next 6 months. Hopefully running your own neutrino wallet with autopilot will be like running a light wallet today.
@_date: 2019-04-05 18:32:45
Hey I hear you. I’ve run my own node for more than a year, and given a neutrino wallet option I would never recommend a custodial one. I’d still argue there’s value in experimenting today. We can’t expect “normies” to host their own full nodes today (or until it’s bundled somewhere out of mind). That’s not realistic..
@_date: 2018-03-23 18:14:58
I hope this means ill have my TenX card within a few months! ��
@_date: 2018-03-20 06:28:11
I’ll have to try this today!
@_date: 2018-03-20 17:10:56
Hey, ready for that invoice now! :)
@_date: 2018-03-20 17:10:09
That is basically how it is now. Rebalancing channels is something that need to be solved. It is an interesting problem in itself. Smarter routing algorithms that prioritise routes where channels needs to be balanced is just one of many solutions. 
Maybe there will be a market for "channel arbitrage" where you are paid to balance out channels. 
@_date: 2018-03-20 21:24:53
When I say rebalance I don't mean refunding the channel. Say we have 4 nodes:
A, B, C, D set up with the following channels:
A(10) -&gt; (0)B(10) -&gt; (0)C(10) -&gt; (10)D
A(5) -&gt; (10)D
We have several unbalanced channels where all the funds are all on one side
A is to pay D 5 satoshi.
He could either pay D directly leaving him with a unbalanced channel to D, or he could pay through B-&gt;C-&gt;D and rebalance the funds in those channels. Yes it would be more hops, but maybe C even has a negative fee basically paying him to use the channel. The routing algorithms can be made to prioritise balancing the network when calculating a route to your destination. 
@_date: 2018-03-20 18:35:35
I think most of the complexity of lightning will end up being completely hidden from the end user. Much like using the internet. You dont have to think about routing, ports, packet loss and so on. 
You will download an app, transfer some funds and scan some QR-code. The network will handle the rest. Call me an optimist \o/
@_date: 2018-03-19 20:48:59
didnt work... ~~Does that mean than one of the channels I need to use requires 101 satoshies as a fee?~~
payment_error": "FeeInsufficient(fee=101000 mSAT, update=(lnwire.ChannelUpdate)
edit: The channel I need to use is only funded with your 100 satoshis. And I need 102 to send it back. Make me an invoice of 98! ;)
@_date: 2018-03-19 18:20:27
Ah cool. Thanks for answering!
@_date: 2018-03-19 21:30:59
Check my edit :)
@_date: 2018-03-19 20:21:32
Sure ill try. Whats your address?
Here try this one:
@_date: 2018-03-19 18:24:47
Aye. I tried to connect to Sleepyark but wasn't able to. After several attempts I ended up connecting to someone who had a well funded channel to Sleepy. Then I was able to make a payment!
@_date: 2018-03-20 06:27:30
I went to bed. Ill send it back when I get back from work since the invoice only is valid for an hour
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:31:00
The problem with this example is that the "poor" person is risking 50% of his funds into BTC while the rich only does 5%. 
Not diversifying risk makes some lucky fools very wealthy while the others stay poor.

I've been struggling with Windows for sometime now. Yesterday I just set up a virtual ubuntuimage with virtualbox. Now Im up and running!
@_date: 2018-07-08 14:07:55
Have had a node running for a while now. So far it has processed 7 transactions �� I guess most users are connecting to the major places you can spend btc directly
@_date: 2018-04-02 11:50:55
That explaination was brilliant!
@_date: 2018-04-22 09:16:02
Bet placed! Can I see it displayed somewhere? 
I didn't understand what timeframe I'm betting on. Is it settled after 5 days?
@_date: 2018-04-08 18:24:05
I have a VM running bitcoind + lnd.
Made some channels and ordered som stickers using the terminal-client.
This weekend I got Zap-desktop working from my laptop (using my node on the network). Bought a Steam voucher, and everything worked flawlessly!
To use Zap you need to download the source and run it yourself. But it was fairly easy to set up.
@_date: 2018-04-22 12:19:38
Im out and about. I’ll check it out when I get home. Can’t wait for an iOS client!
@_date: 2018-04-02 15:36:01
I was just referring to the image. It helped me get a better understanding of how satoshis could end up moving in the network. 
For the end user I agree with you. It’s up to the devs to hide away complexity and present a simple experience. 
@_date: 2018-04-22 07:13:44
Watched an ad -&gt; invoice got paid �� on the first try.
I've left my channels idle for some weeks now. This was pretty cool! 
@_date: 2019-05-10 12:46:20
I totally agree! I’m definitely looking for something that’s good enough for now. Everything is an upgrade from where I am now.
@_date: 2019-05-10 13:15:14
Can you link anything or elaborate on how to do this canary version?
@_date: 2019-05-16 13:27:36
Definitely get a lightning node set up. Then you can use ⚡️ without using a custodial wallet in your phone!
@_date: 2018-12-30 16:59:08
I found it easiest to run my LN node along with bicoind inside an virtualbox linux image. It requires you to be somewhat linux savvy, but it makes everything \_a lot\_ easier.
