You can't do bears! You don't have the power!
@_date: 2017-02-17 03:59:43
Not necessarily. Chinese exchanges aren't fully operational. Moreover, risk is still there, it's just being transferred and distributed elsewhere.
@_date: 2017-02-11 01:56:03
If someone wants to sell, I wouldn't discourage them.

I've yet to have a negative experience with Coinbase support. In the last week, they replied to both of my questions within 24 hours. Given recent events, I feel like that's better than acceptable.     
@_date: 2017-01-08 20:14:26
I doubt it. Today, it's just another imaginary number to most people. Hopefully, as people learn about, adopt, and trust, their opinion will shift. But numbers alone, IMO, won't do much.
@_date: 2017-01-08 20:46:36
Agreed. It's pretty amazing to think about. I don't think the volatility is going to subside anytime soon though. Not until 75-80% of the countries are fully invested into the movement. 
As compelling as China's Bitcoin story is, I also find Nigeria interesting. We're talking about COUNTRIES ... making an entry into the market here.
@_date: 2017-01-05 00:45:04
Sell 100 BTC for a down payment then sell 1BTC week/month.   
@_date: 2017-01-26 03:01:49
ponzi scheme. you really don't have a soul, do you?
@_date: 2017-01-22 17:36:12
Seems like if each exchange did their own thing, that would invite confusion and unnecessary complexity. KISS.   
@_date: 2017-01-06 03:14:18
@_date: 2017-01-06 03:54:07
It's hard to tell in a 24 hour exchange when China keeps pouring millions into the market. It's like gravity (flip the graph upside down). All objects are getting pulled to the center of China's mass.

Read [this]( Then do some due diligence on the people contributing to the discussion. That should give you a better idea.
@_date: 2017-01-14 07:32:00
No, anything to help keep Bitcoin off this list  is good.

IMO, to be effective on a global scale, it needs to be owned and managed by global consortium, not a person or foundation residing in a single country. Think Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) + International Monetary Fund (IMF). Otherwise, you have a bunch of conflicts of interest and, perhaps, misleading content. 
@_date: 2016-12-29 18:27:34
Good luck catching the knife 
@_date: 2017-01-08 20:04:51
However, it should be noted, the climb from a $16 billion to $2.1 or $21 trillion USD market cap is going to be long and arduous. Then what happens? Will the summit keep rising until the end of time?
@_date: 2016-12-26 15:27:43
Maybe not. It depends on the alternative. It could be Bitcoins saving grace.

@_date: 2016-12-26 08:05:13

@_date: 2016-12-31 00:39:23
In short, capital flowing into the market would increase demand. Checkout these articles.
Now, take those numbers and do some fuzzy logic with the current Bitcoin market cap of ~15 billion.

Just giving you some advice...
@_date: 2018-06-12 15:19:24
Stop projecting. If you want this lower, make it happen doughboy.
@_date: 2016-12-30 09:31:43
It depends on cost of living and age. It's certainly not far fetched.
@_date: 2018-06-14 20:23:17
You're wrong.
@_date: 2018-06-12 15:30:00
Ahh, it sounds like you're one of the emo traders. Good riddance. Don't worry about me, I know what I'm doing.
@_date: 2018-06-12 15:35:21
Ahh, a narcissist. Like I said, good riddance.
@_date: 2016-12-26 08:39:57
Or $692

It's not a realistic problem. If and when the day comes, the developers will move to bigger blocks. 
Scarcity fosters innovation. 
@_date: 2018-06-14 20:10:22
Bitcoin is a store of value. It is digital gold. Nothing more, nothing less. If you abuse (day trade, spend, panic sell, short while undervalued, etc), you will eventually regret.
@_date: 2018-06-10 12:48:44
Ahh, young grasshopper. I shall teach you the whale way.
@_date: 2018-06-07 04:47:18
Don't listen to this guy, go all in.
@_date: 2018-06-14 20:03:24
Not necessarily, it depends on the participant. We are a very patient group with different exit strategies.
@_date: 2016-12-26 07:31:47
@_date: 2018-06-15 01:18:59

I'm going to terminate your game, Mr. Bear.
@_date: 2019-02-12 07:06:15
Anything is possible. In terms of volatility, you won't find another market with the same yield.
My hangup about the whole theory is longevity and scope. $500, $1000, $2500. Okay, sure, I can see a nasty battle shaping up ... but for how long and how many exchanges? 1 major exchange (eg Bitfinex, Coinbase, etc) could wick down to $1000 for 1 second ... did the theory materialize?
@_date: 2019-02-13 07:32:44
Hmmm, I think I'll buy some Bitcoin here.
@_date: 2019-02-06 00:01:27

Vive la résistance!
@_date: 2017-04-01 02:59:45
Can you elaborate?
@_date: 2018-11-27 21:28:46
Indeed, how you define success is subjective.
@_date: 2018-11-29 16:36:51
Yea, something like that.
@_date: 2018-03-03 01:09:09
The psychology behind Bitcoin is just as important as the technology.
@_date: 2018-11-27 21:47:04
Well, I'm beyond that ...

@_date: 2018-03-02 17:20:02
Wait or buy more, don't sell now.
@_date: 2018-03-02 14:36:45
Oh, don't worry, I put my money where my mouth is.
@_date: 2018-11-25 08:50:45
It sure is! You could've DCA'd, arb'd, and traded ALTs and you would've been much better off.
@_date: 2018-11-27 20:31:17

In reality, it lasted for about 42 days (12/26 - 2/6).
buy and HODL, buy and HODL, repeat ... that's the only way you can win this game.
@_date: 2018-03-02 15:04:34
Indeed. It doesn't need to go down, it IS down. Short away, give it your all.
@_date: 2018-11-26 11:46:00

The fed would need to mine, purchase, or otherwise acquire Bitcoin in a legitimate and fair manner. Oddly enough, I think **most** countries would struggle with the duty. 
@_date: 2018-11-28 02:18:00
Are you short?
@_date: 2018-02-23 01:47:16
That's what happens when you buy the ATH.
@_date: 2018-03-03 17:59:25
We will rip through it like a hot knife through butter.
@_date: 2018-02-26 19:50:56
It's not personal at all. I'm just telling you what will happen. With every passing minute, there are fewer and fewer shorts. In other words, 10,2 today, is not the same 10,2 as a couple days ago, or 90 days ago for that matter ...
@_date: 2018-03-03 05:09:37
Strange force around 11337 ...
@_date: 2018-02-28 04:00:54
If we break, great, but if not, no rush, just need to hold 10,9.
@_date: 2018-02-19 09:08:01
@_date: 2018-02-26 19:44:43
@_date: 2018-02-26 19:33:59
10,2 is holding up exceptionally well.
This is how you Bonsai. Not everyone has the endurance, grit, or perspective to see the beauty ...
@_date: 2018-02-10 05:25:30
Looks like we have a few more bridges to burn. 10k gentlemen, 10k.
@_date: 2018-03-04 17:17:25
In my anecdotal experience, Sunday afternoons/evenings (US timezones) are known for being bullish. I think many participants use the day for weekly buys or to get in before the beginning of the week.
Wouldn't be surprised to see 11,6 in 4-8 hours.
@_date: 2018-02-26 23:15:53
This is looking beautiful.
@_date: 2018-03-03 17:16:09
I wouldn't be surprised to see 10K, or even 8K, again if we're “lucky” in the next 1-3 months. I’m not saying it will happen ... but, have some cheese around for the possibility.
@_date: 2019-01-30 02:53:05
Tis where we dine, they die.
@_date: 2018-03-03 18:53:08
BTC has consolidated above $10K for about 75 days. Also, participants who bought above $12K (about 40 days) have an incentive to DCA when we're lower.
@_date: 2018-03-03 01:21:59
Whales enticing weekend drunk/high FOMO, or is it?
@_date: 2018-02-26 19:47:06
Then don't do anything. You'll be buying higher than 10,2 though.
@_date: 2018-02-12 14:11:10
Lol. You must be new here.
@_date: 2018-02-27 00:20:00
Hmm, let's just call it ... my Bitcoin Bonsai tree that I've been working on for the last month ...
@_date: 2018-02-26 17:14:53
They are the leaders and dreams. You will not find such a strong combination of people anywhere else in the world.
@_date: 2018-02-27 05:36:01
Get ready for the biggest green candle in BTC history.
@_date: 2018-02-28 00:41:11

The weak and feeble don't deserve "bottom". Shaking them out, all day everyday.
@_date: 2018-02-09 18:52:11
Shaking those $$$ grubby traders out left and right.
They never hold through, they don't "believe", thus don't deserve "bottom".

It's on, gentlemen ...
@_date: 2018-02-23 01:45:43
Yes! this is me.
@_date: 2018-03-03 23:02:45
If we recover back to 11,5 within the next hour or 2, that's huge bullish indicator...
@_date: 2018-02-28 05:44:43
People don't know what they're doing/don't have a plan.
@_date: 2018-02-10 01:45:51
Let'm sell, it's healthy.
@_date: 2018-02-27 00:25:59
The dump happened 3 weeks ago. Here comes the pump!
@_date: 2018-02-26 19:26:17
I can feel it guys, it's coming...
@_date: 2018-02-12 05:01:12
Be honest, you sold or never bought. Now STFU.
@_date: 2018-02-09 21:46:22
It's called a shakeout. No rush.
@_date: 2018-02-09 19:22:44
HODL and buy the dips/DCA if you can. We're pushing out the weak. 10k here we come.
@_date: 2018-02-26 05:35:25
I suspect these big numbers are scaring the small guy. Price is irrelevant for big holders/investors right now, they will continue to buy. Look at it this way, $100, $95, $92, $88 ... not much of a difference, it's all the same when million/billionaires are DCA'ing.
@_date: 2018-02-26 19:40:27
Get off the 1h, 6h, timeframes and zoom out to something like 1-7d. 
@_date: 2018-03-02 14:28:11
Weak trader hands. Good time to go all in (10,7-10,8). You will not be disappointed with what's about to happen.

@_date: 2018-07-20 19:35:38
The bears done lost their damn mind today! Not 1, but 2 tests! Well, we've come this far, why not 3 or 4!?
@_date: 2018-07-28 02:48:03
Give it up bears, it's over!
@_date: 2018-12-24 00:04:44

4k ... lives will be created, and destroyed here.
@_date: 2017-09-02 02:41:23
It will be back. Went up way too fast. I doubt it but I wouldn't be surprised to see 2500.
