omg, so crazy fanatism :( 
no they will not be their own bank, very few people are fucking able to keep their money safe for crist sake, this shit is almost for above tech savvy, you have to be really technical to manage bitcoin.
we need more infrastructure, we are trying to grow faster than what we are growing

i have the same doubt,  wonder what happens if the controller of the address just issues more coloursatoshis without really representing the reality. ie a stock of the company ?
Something interesting cound be controlling the company using multisignature.
you assign an stock colour address with multisignature
give the signature to the major owners
when increasing shares, all of them have to provide their key 
i think interesting things could come out of this, im also thinking in protecting goverment money from the goverment

He means that you are being very paranoid.
i also dont give a shit if google or amazon know what i buy, hell, sometimes amazon gives me great book recommendations based on my previous purchases :D  
also i have found a few times google adds useful when discovering a service or company i didnt know it existed.

Better to just deposit the 30% to whatever exchange and buy the bitcoin in a DIP instead of buying it randomly

its half a million dollars for fucks sake, might as well ask!
plus MTGox problems were not related to Deposits :).
now there is a trial japan justice has access to mark, he would be quite idiot to deny due diligence 
furthermore the process could cost what 5K USD, for the possibility of recovering 500k, also original owner could offer 50, 100 or whatever K legally transferred to MTGox for the recovery of his money.
We got a saying, in asking there is no deceit.
do we know what was the destination address ?

MTgox still has the power over those addresses, with a lawyer and a cop he can probably get it back IMO

But he doesn't state that the rise will stop, he simply says that the adoption untill today, its not enough for him in order to INVEST.
now he is not a technical guy, i think we are mostly technical people, and that is why we are able to take a bigger leap of faith for the technological invention, and we take a bigger risk, but in the same way i understand why my father would NOT buy a bitcoin in at least 2 or 3 more years, he also wont, untill is almost certain success.
I bought bitcoins, and i think that ultimately i will loose money, either because as soon as a shop is opened in my town ill be forced to start expending the money, and its ok, im not in this for money, im here for the technology.
this guy cannot be like me, because he doesnt care at all about the technology of promoting its success, he will invest when he is sure he will make money with it.
i insist, what he says about bitcoin is quite possitive. 
@_date: 2014-03-11 07:57:09
you guys have terrible understanding skills:
to summarize:
He says bitcoin is awesome, it is a solution to a problem that works
He says as investor it doesn't matter because, in his criteria, bitcoin is not READY to be invested on according to his own criteria.
he actually likes bitcoin! he spoke in pro of it! and he wishes that it gets to a point in which for him its a sure investing opportunity and not an extremely risky one (which it is, i have there just 1.5k USD and im terrified everyday XD i keep it there just because i love the idea of bitcoin)
@_date: 2014-05-17 10:30:54
it is given in exchange of a service, you are trading your info for a service, and many people are willing.
about the wallets, there is no wallet that my mom would be able to use.

i think 0 is really cheap, in fact im willing to buy all your bitcoins for that price :3, not only yours but everybody's.

my brother finished law 2 years ago, he hates it and constantly think it was the worst decision of his life, complains of the difficulty getting a decent job, and even more about the fact that you are screwed and WILL  have to sell your honor, dignity and integrity. 
@_date: 2014-03-17 13:16:17
Considering the following points:
its recommended that every receiving transaction has its unique address in order to keep order.
Considering a 50% of people over 15 years in the world started using bitcoin (i would totally consider this mass acceptance)
how long would the the addresses for receiving bitcoins last before its statistically possible for someone who generates an address to have a duplicate?
shouldnt there be a system implemente to avoid the generation of duplicate addresses ?

Because Google is a big name, and more normal users appreciate that, plus it would probably user friendly and so on, dont be so square man, there are other people different from you ;)
@_date: 2014-03-29 11:08:42
Eof, open your mind, not everybody is and will act in the same way as you do; for instance, there is no way my father would be able to mantain a hot storage, let alone a cold one, he cant even use the bank webpage.
Some people are self sufficient, and they will do everything themselves without need of help.
other people are not, and even worst techignorants, so they will need help, and a friendly infrastructure that is able to provide them with the services they might need.
having ATM is very usefull because BTC is nothing yet, and wont be super mainstream as to never need cash in 50 years, there will be cash, and if we are lucky you might be able to pay in BTC as well...
About the learning curve, you are assuming that everyone knows how to navigate, well, let me drop you to the real world, very few people know how to, at least not properly, and i definetely wouldnt like my wife to manage our life savings in BTC if she does it the way she navigates XD.

"Without Bitcoin in my life I honestly wouldn't have much hope for freedom, peace or prosperity"
USA is a great country, saying that there is no hope there, is in my opinion a very extreme exaggeration, i replied with another wide exaggeration.
from all the countries in the world, USA is one of the top few with the highest hope for prosperity, this is regardless of the NSA, the IRS, the FBI, all the government, because within world context, the USA one is pretty decent.
as a side note, there is NO government agency i trust, also no private company i trust, only friends and family.
@_date: 2014-03-18 05:56:28
awesome, thanks for the answers :p
i was thinking a second file with a list of already assigned addresses would help if there is an issue, but obviously its simply an improbability

well it makes sense, this kind of things are automatically backed up, probably the access its withing the mtgox database which is offline at the moment.
in my opinion there is a pretty decent chance there, and for 1/2 a million dollars, i would hire a lawyer to do a lil check up

happy to be at kraken, reported a bug and they took it seriously and into account very fast, even if it wasent a big damaging bug.
@_date: 2013-12-09 22:50:25
how about for example translations? say companies need to have an on-demand document translation, would it be reasonable to do it online and pay via bitcoin ?
basically pay for what you get ?
my idea is along this line, and again be honest :) i dont want to give false hope :D
thanks for the answers!

the meaning of the post is not as if it is technically possible or not, its more like a poll to find out if its worth it to give it a shot :).
