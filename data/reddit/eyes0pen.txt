It does have lightning, it's actually pretty hard to notice since Ltc transactions are already lightyears faster than Btc's. 
This was activated early in September for LTC's network.

HA! That might be true of Roger Ver and his ilk. Charlie is one of the most upstanding and honest Devs out there, TO DATE. Show me some honest proof as to why you say this about him?

Why not just use litecoin? You know the first ones to implement the lightning network.

how did you get a response within 2 hours? I've had a support case open for 3 months and I'm STILL locked out of my acocunt.

That makes their ignorant stance even worse, once Gdax or a newer alternative gain traction coinbase will fall to the wayside. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 16:22:48
I work with multiple fortune 500 companies that are easier to deal with than coinbase on any given day of the week. Their reputation will be their downfall if that is the only concern they have when dealing with the public.

As far as I was aware it was a partnership to bring exposure to Gdax, I could be misinformed about this which would render my last comment incorrect. But you get the idea here, if Kraken was as widely used as coinbase is do you think coinbase would have the stability that kraken does? Basically flipping the roles ya know.

My timeline was off for sure.

"Yeah but Bitcoin has been around a lot longer" is pretty subjective at this crossroads. considering they were barely months apart.

That's duly noted, but look at what is on **Our** horizon, Quantum tech. We *Will* see the new internet, I'm merely focused on how we are going to get past the walls we have built around our fortress.

Thanks for the helpful replies! I am new to actually dealing with the exchanges and what not. I totally understand that the price *Will* vary depending on what is happening with each exchanges(Mt. Gox/ Bitstamp) and how the economies(U.s/China) decide to implement bitcoin into their systems on a grand scale. I have been Keeping a close eye on where Bitcoin is going and have decided that i missed my chance to make "free" money. That is **Not** what I am attempting to do, my confidence is born from a need to decentralize and what bitcoin can/**IS** doing in the world at this moment. If i don't make any money from my O.I then that would be fine. I want to help support the infrastructure of what I see as an International break through in decentralizing the wealth. I could be 100% wrong i get that, but that is why I'm asking for help!I want to make sure I'm seeing things clearly. Thanks again for any all replies!

any other alt coins you think have profitability% close to BBQ or any of the top 3-4?

I was looking for That exact link! thank you!

That's what i was kind of seeing. Thanks!

I was implying that it(zero) will be graphed into an all new protocol on its own. Brain fart i think i was referencing this  but it had some rough patches early on I lost interest in the project.

Honestly you make a good point. Nostalgic mining was Fun for a few months then it dove into a black whole for your electric bill to dump copious amounts of your hard earned Usd. My buddy was calling his rig the confirmation station back when the Qt was still in testing.

I'm only using history as an example and augmenting my theory based on how the world/markets are reacting to it(bitcoin). Think about it from this perspective, the first set of regulation/protocols for many things ranging from boats/money/computers/farms/roads/production of sorted goods. You should be able to grasp the direction I'm headed with this. It's a matter of time.
@_date: 2013-11-12 22:27:48
I totally get that, I'm not saying its needed in that sense. All i meant was that one think simply does not last forever, it's core fundamentals will eventually break down. That is when another coin **Will* replace it. The only thing I was trying to get out of this was to spur a few intellectuals into talking about the topic in general.

I Sadly missed the first rush, but i still kept the miners in the basement. They help me give you guys this cryptostuff and you give me real stuff back! The only real downside is the miner's, they do whine a lot &amp;

What are your thoughts on Mdc's and zerocoin's abilities to compare on a larger level?
