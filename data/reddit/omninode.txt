Bitcoin is not for the poor. It is both expensive to use and risky.
@_date: 2018-01-24 19:59:05
Ah yes, Bitcoin, where there are no fees at all.
@_date: 2018-01-24 20:01:12
That's not really true. My credit union just got an app a few months ago, and it's terrible. I'm sure there are some that still don't have apps.

It doesn’t mean she was wrong. These things are unpredictable.
@_date: 2015-12-15 17:48:41
You consider a currency strong if it increases in value? That's a pretty weird standard.
@_date: 2014-03-02 05:55:01
Better to trust some anonymous users on reddit? At least there is some recourse if a lawyer or CPA tries to scam you.
@_date: 2014-09-12 14:38:48
Sounds better than "Bitcoin: You're on your own."
@_date: 2014-05-05 21:58:06
There are better ways to get rich if that's all you want.
@_date: 2014-03-11 22:03:36
Yeah, punish people for not using Bitcoin, that should really boost its popularity.
@_date: 2018-05-24 03:29:31
Bitcoin still isn’t a good currency. 
@_date: 2014-04-13 12:07:42
Music by committee. What could go wrong?
@_date: 2014-05-25 20:59:44
Those people are idiots.
@_date: 2014-03-11 22:04:38
Can you see my eyes rolling from where you are? Because I'm doing it super hard.
@_date: 2014-04-11 02:47:18


... it would make my life more meaningful ...
Yikes. As things get more dire, Bitcoin evangelists sound more like cult members.
@_date: 2014-05-03 20:23:35
How is that Bitcoin 401k working out for you?
@_date: 2014-07-16 03:15:48
I wonder how much the Winklevoss twins paid him to do that.
@_date: 2014-05-05 22:01:01
This is exactly why I prefer iPhone. Less clutter, straight to the point.
@_date: 2014-03-16 21:21:33
But those are both legitimate observations.
@_date: 2014-05-05 21:59:50
The point remains, they haven't done it with this app.
@_date: 2014-06-22 08:03:32
Wow, that could be as much as $60!
@_date: 2014-05-07 01:25:12
I think the assumption is it will have to be cheaper to operate than the Concorde.
@_date: 2014-04-11 02:57:38
This just in: Guy who owns a lot of Bitcoin wants people to keep investing in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-08-19 08:35:59
I would be very surprised if anybody put their life savings into dogecoin. I think most people are just having fun with it.
@_date: 2014-09-13 00:38:09
Exactly. These guys are nothing but opportunists trying to pump up their own investments.
@_date: 2014-03-20 19:49:59
I predict the dollar bill will be worth approximately one U.S. dollar.

He's CEO. That means he delegates various functions to people below him. He doesn't know everything because he doesn't *need* to know everything. If and when Bitcoin becomes a big enough deal for the CEO of Morgan Stanley to care, I'm sure he will be brought up to speed just fine.
@_date: 2014-03-05 20:44:29
Because those guys have never made a mistake.
@_date: 2014-03-12 23:12:01
What's 5% of zero?

Am I the only person here who would like to know more about "Apple's request" before I say fuck Apple? Like maybe we shouldn't just take what the developer says at face value? You people are so quick to anger, it's ridiculous.
@_date: 2014-03-14 11:41:09
If you had read the page you linked to, you would see that it requires good faith in the actual bankruptcy process, not that everything you have done in the past was in good faith. I think that's an important distinction.
@_date: 2014-04-11 02:54:24
One might even argue that investing hundreds of thousands of dollars in computer money and becoming emotionally attached to it is a fucking dumb thing to do.
@_date: 2014-04-11 02:50:55
Sadly, many people here fail to recognize that a guy who owns hundreds of Bitcoin might possibly have an ulterior motive in telling people not to sell their Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-03-19 22:01:04
Yeah, that was a super serious discussion. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:20:23
At this point, if you trusted Mt. Gox.
@_date: 2015-01-15 15:53:37
What is your alternative?
@_date: 2014-03-17 00:27:41
Sure, but bonds have a (virtually) guaranteed return.

Nobody trusts bitcoin as a currency because of its constantly fluctuating value. And the value will keep fluctuating as long as people are afraid to leave their money in bitcoin. It’s a self-perpetuating cycle and I don’t see it ending. 
There was a period of time when people were excited to put a small percentage of their money in bitcoin and use it to buy things, when the value was steadily rising. I know there were ups and downs, but the value of a bitcoin was clearly rising month to month for a couple of years. You could buy $100 worth of bitcoin and easily expect to get $120 worth of spending power out of it if you made small transactions over a few months. Nobody cared about transaction fees because that would just come out of that extra $20 you got. 
Then 2017 showed us that bitcoin as a system was unprepared to handle high values and high volume. Transaction fees and delays got ridiculous. People got cold feet (or straight up lost a ton of money when the price crashed) and now it’s stuck in this hell cycle.

Wow. Mueller is finding all kinds of stuff.

"A QR code? These were outlawed back in the 20s! Don't let mom see it."
@_date: 2015-09-19 20:07:21
Now it doesn't look like a scam, it just looks totally incompetent.
@_date: 2015-02-01 04:19:00
It's only frictionless for people who already understand Bitcoin, which is far less than the number of people who know how to use a credit card.

Cry me a river. This was not some harmless hacking project. And he's not a kid, he's 30 years old. This was a sophisticated criminal enterprise. He made millions of dollars helping people commit felonies, and committing major crimes himself. I won't be sad if he never sees daylight again.
@_date: 2015-02-15 04:00:36
That was easy.
@_date: 2015-02-05 01:43:47
You don't get to choose to ignore the laws you don't like. This guy knew he would face serious prison time if he got caught, but he did the crimes anyway, and he got caught. End of story.

You mean the ingredient that will turn away 90% of potential customers? Most people don't know how Bitcoin works and they're not going to invest in a Bitcoin wallet just to get some convenient wifi.
@_date: 2019-05-16 23:10:06
I don’t think it’s going to be as fast as cable internet.
