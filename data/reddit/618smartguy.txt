Saying bitcoin will eventually fail is just as speculative as saying a single bitcoin will buy an entire country some day.

The hype wouldn't have existed if it werent for the technology impressing the world and the well informed spreading the word of the fundamental differences between crypto and fiat. If noobs want to panic sell thats fine, it has happened before and bitcoin is still doing alright. But notice that each crash is smaller than the one before, and generates more buzz than the previous as well.

You can absolutely buy apples with bitcoin. And what do you mean? People use bitcoin for speculation? I'm saying there is at least a trillion usd worth of transactions on the blockchain that isn't part of an exchange, that's directly proof that you are wrong that it is only used as a speculative asset

You are sort of right that it takes energy to move the electrons around, but the thing is when you use a tiny bit of energy to let's say turn on a transistor, that energy is stored in the transistor and will eventually leave it when it turns off. Power dissapating through resistance is what produces heat, but the power going in and out of devices that store a tiny bit of energy can be ignored because it always eventually cancels out or eventually becomes heat.

The bitcoin blockchain is transiting around 4 trillion usd per day, there must be a lot of exchanges but only the biggest ones are even at a billion per day, so it looks like people are using it for something.

Coinbase is basically also a bank, not anything like holding your own coins, and any argument against coinbase as a store of value is also an argument for using bitcoin instead. 
@_date: 2018-02-18 02:11:09
Exchanges are the price we pay for still using USD so much.

Why would ASICBOOST be considered cheating/exploiting/unfiar? I read the technical patent and my understanding is that all it does is eliminate some redundant computation when hashing the beginning of blocks, and still finds blocks as valid as any other miner. Any other miner with the skill/resources can implement the same strategy, so long as they don't care about or make enough changes as to not infringe on the copyright. But exploiting patents is not the same as exploiting bitcoin.

Was the first person to mine bitcoin on a GPU scamming because they came up with a faster way to mine bitcoin? Why are they even obliged to sell their chips to the public at all? Seems like people are just salty that they aren't getting as much profit because of asicboost.

So bitcoin gets stolen from centralized entities, but not the btc blockchain. All the manipulation and crap is happening on centralized exchanges that won't matter in the future when decentralized exchanges are the norm.
@_date: 2017-09-29 00:53:54
Why would you rather sue them then just take your bitcoin out and go elsewhere? Also your user page is page not found rofl
@_date: 2017-10-24 21:53:46
Asicboost can still hash any random input. The assumptions on headers only affects the speedup part of the process. You know, You don't even need to be able to hash any arbitrary data. If you wanted you could still just fail on most hashes. Its not like part of the bitcoin protocol involves asking a miner to hash some spesific data, they only need to produce valid blocks for the blocks to be accepted, and grant a reward.
@_date: 2017-10-24 21:00:01
Asicboost doesn't reduce the capabilities of the miner, it can still hash arbitrary random input, it only skips duplicate work when it detects that it is possible.

Or just get crypto

How is buying crypto not converting usd with crypto? I spesifically worded it that way to include both directions. And you forgot earning bitcoin for a service you do for someone.
@_date: 2018-02-18 02:15:09
Centralized exchanges are not something you have to use with bitcoin, the only reason someone needs to use a bank like exchange is to convert usd with crypto. Crypto only exchanges can be and are decentralized and more secure. Like people cite problems with using services like coinbase as problems with btc, but it actually stems from the usd side of things.

It takes an input and produces a hash of it that anyone can verify. How is that not a "full" hash? Is there an actual definition of what that means anywhere in the bitcoin protocol?
@_date: 2017-09-29 00:25:45




??? That doesn't answer the question at all   
@_date: 2017-10-24 22:23:17
SHA256 is a function. If an implementation takes an input and the output is equal to SHA256(input), then it has in fact computed the hash. How long it takes or how many steps it took to get there doesnt make the output any more truly or fully equal to SHA256(input).
You keep claiming that it isnt a "full hash". Is this an idea you came up with or do you have some source for this, or what a full hash even is? The execution time must be independent of input or something?
@_date: 2017-10-24 21:30:29
Because it doesn't take as long to do the hash if you've already completed part of it before and saved the collision. They care because it is a change to the algorithm that affects their profits. I'd be pretty pissed if there were a change to the protocol based on peoples opinions on the way I compute hashes. Isn't the bitcoin network supposed to be trustless?  How can you draw a line between a miner using some unknown optimization vs a typical miner without going to their operation and auditing them on their mining method, given that they are both producing equally valid blocks to an outside observer? What if ASICBOOST were never revealed publicly? We would have no way of knowing that they were doing something differently because all the network would see is a stream of perfectly valid blocks that support the network like any other blocks.
@_date: 2017-10-24 21:09:38
It massively reduces the amount of redundant work, eliminating the performance boost, but it does not start throwing errors or anything. ASICBOOST is still just a hashing chip.
@_date: 2017-10-25 00:16:55


This is where you have a critical misunserstanding. They do NOT require anything to be special about the input in order to compute the sha256 hash, which is all thats required to mine bitcoin.
The formatting of the input affects ONLY the efficiency of the mining process, and  never has any identifiable effect on resulting hashes or blocks.

Hodl doesn't negate people using bitcon in the way you want them to. Sure in mass it can affect the price, but that means you are just complaining about price spikes, while volume and adoption are slowly and steadily fixing that.

But dont bitcoin and stocks effectively follow Brownian motion? No matter how accurately a trend is being followed isn't there very little correlation the current trend and tomorrow? Plus looking at diff er rent resolutions you will always come up with different ideas as to where exactly the peaks and trends are
