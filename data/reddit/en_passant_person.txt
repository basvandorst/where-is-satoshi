Any bot that can send payments from your account on your behalf, and which you do not control yourself complete, is NOT secure.
@_date: 2018-01-08 03:42:57
The rules are simple: a secure password, and a secure form of 2FA and recovery. The most secure forms of 2FA are hardware tokens and phone based authenticators.
It's a good idea to maintain a 2FA protected recovery/hidden email account that never sends, receives, or is used for any forum, service, or system registration (i.e. never exposed) that acts as your fallback. Always log into this account using an incognito session or completely clean profile. 
If you're hyper-paranoid: get yourself a cheap junk chrome book that is used solely for accessing this email account. it'll never be at risk of keylogging, although that should never be an issue if you're also using a secure 2FA solution. 
tl;dr: the more you can separate/gap day to day activity from sensitive activity, the safer you will be. Gapping increases like this: separate profile -&gt; separate email -&gt; separate browser -&gt; separate device and can be combined into a layered approach that will not only protect you from breaches but mitigate the severity of any breach occurring. A hardware based 2FA (such as a phone with Google authenticator or a dongle like Vasco GO3/GO6) is superior to any SMS, email, or other "2FA" solution.

To figure this out, ask yourself what they are on the inside of.
Insider trading is when you have knowledge that comes from the inside. Example: if a company insider leaks information to you that has a reasonable expectation of a rise/fall in the stock price of that company, that's insider trading.

CORS is a standard for dealing with cross origin requests wherein a page on a different domain is permitted to access resources from another domain (or denied, as the case may be).
It has nothing to do with exploits and is not specific to chrome.
More likely, you installed an addon that had permission to monitor all websites, and that addon caught the credential information being typed into your account.
The addon is granted permission to all your data on all websites and pages you visit. 
Addons are sandboxed, they cannot access your local file system, or directly access your keyboard to perform keylogging, however an appropriately authorised addon CAN read anything you enter into any form field or input control on any page.
It appears you know just enough about stuff to be a danger to yourself. While a layered approach to security is great, panicing is not. 
* You should never interact with sensitive services using a browser instance that has addons enabled. Chrome extensions are installed on a per profile basis, you can simply create an additional user in chrome for all your sensitive operations, or you can perform them in a clean incognito session. Any extension that can read the data you enter into a website can read every single password and login you provide. You are giving open access to the keys to your kingdoms.
For most people, if your email is compromised, that's 90% game over. It should be the most secure as it acts as the fall back for your other accounts and services. Anyone with access to your email account can use password resets to access any other account that is not protected by 2FA.

HODL itself is a meme. 
Question is - are you investing in Bitcoin because you see it as ultimately replacing fiat (government backed and controlled) currency, or because the gains have been massive and you could cash out to your regional fiat with a tidy profit?
If the latter, you'd do better with careful share trading, pick up some cheap stocks and set up 20% buy/sell orders. 
If the former, this is what bitcoin (and all cryptocurrencies really) is about. 
Who sets the value of bitcoin? The people doing the most trading in it. It's not designed or intended as an investment vehicle. The more you can buy with bitcoin, and easier it is, the more valuable bitcoin becomes. 
This is why it is of vital importance that solutions for mempool and fees are deployed sooner rather than later. 
I don't think the "flippening" is going to happen, but it could, and it does get more likely the longer we go without a proper solution.

No, I'm pretty sure your goal is to see how much you can get away with insulting and deriding another person while pretending to be the enlightened one bringing wisdom to the conversation. Son, I'm past that. I've already been there. I've been a nihilist, a pagan (practicing thelema and agape), I've studied Christianity and Judaism, zen and Buddhism. I've contemplated the potential of a multiverse, and I've written songs and sonnets about it both. 
I'm wondering if you can hear the self contradictions in your writing. If you even realise what it is you are doing. Anecdotally, some of the worst offenders don't realise they are offensive. A lot of that has to do with the home environment growing up - learning it from the parents, so to speak. 
Were it not for the gaslighting, you'd be me ten years ago, when I was still figuring out who I was and how things worked. I got past it though, determined for myself what it is I want, and what it would take to get it, and I'm a good way to having achieved all of it.

I love how you say "my generation" as if that sets you apart as something unique or special. It doesn't. You're not. FTR: I was born in '75
Gaslighting or gas-lighting is pretty well defined. It's not something you should need me to define for you - or should be expecting me to define for you. It is not new, or novel in any way. The term itself dates back the 1930-40s when houses used gas lamps instead of electric lighting, and specifically, to a play called "Gaslight" in which a man attempts to convince his wife she is going crazy by manipulating the lights while maintaining that he has not noticed any change at all. 
Wikipedia (a great resource, you know) puts it very elegantly in two sentences:


Intentionally or not, this is what you have been doing with your snide personal comments about me. If you were dealing fairly and honestly, you wouldn't be resorting to such inept attempts. Of course, if I was younger and more easily intimidated or manipulated, my confidence probably would have been eroded by your continued remarks. Fortunately, I'm not young, nor inexperienced, nor naive. I have been in the metaphorical trenches a long time, so I've learned to recognize the many ways people attempt to manipulate their way to a dishonest victory. 
A quick review:








Individually, only one of these things is particularly a deliberate insult - while all of them are based on flawed arguments and assumptions, however they establish a pattern of subtle insinuation that is intended to erode confidence. "You're young", "You don't understand the way the world works", "You're unhappy with life", "trust your betters", "you'll learn". Little whispers that enter the ear of the naive and eat away the confidence and make someone question their sanity and whether they can trust their own thoughts, their own perceptions. 
That kind of thing. The truth is, none of those are applicable. I am not young, I am well acquainted with how the world works, I'm very happy with my life (My wife is beautiful, smart, and every bit my equal and yet completely different to me, my job pays well and I can afford all the expenses of my life, and I have privilege and leisure to fart around on the internet to my hearts content). I'm also fortunate to have experienced many life altering challenging and traumatic events and situations that drove a great deal of emotional growth. This is why, despite these worm-worded sentences, I am largely unaffected by this conversation. I'm actually way more curious and scientifically interested.

That you can make anything sound serious or significant by choosing a metric or unit of scale that sounds that way. A jug of water is massively more than a pippette, but is it significant? 
The whole argument about this is predicated on the idea that bitcoin electricity consumption is "ravenous" and out of scale with what is being done. No one has actually tested that assertion, nor have they collated how much of the electricity being used comes from renewable sources, how much energy efficiency investment is being driven by miners looking to improve yield per watt etc.

Different styles are applicable in different contexts. We're not talking about someone writing a letter to family, a novel, or a thesis. We're talking about someone writing a headline - an article or thread title. In this context, since you are referencing someone else's work, it's expected and proper that quotation marks indicate a quotation. 
Yes, in other contexts, you can use it to indicate a concept, paraphrase, or abstract - just as I did repeatedly in this discussion. That's "Apples and oranges" though. 
Using quotes to describe a concept is appropriate when the concept is described in the form of a 'quote' - i.e. paraphrasing or monologue.


This could also be written as "there is no cut-and-paste-this-html-code-into-your-web-page logic involved here. However, quoting is appropriate because it's a monologue, a proposed description or paraphrasing of something that might have been included but wasn't ('there is no'). 
However the concept described by '"pay with Paypal" like button' doesn't exist in the source material and is not negated in the topic. It's not appropriate to include it as quoted material, and the inclusion of it is not even accurate to the source material.

None of these are in-line with the way it is used in the title of this thread. Now, as I said specifically, you don't have to follow the rules 100% of the time. But not doing so is confusing, and you cannot argue it's not. Nor can you argue that the rules don't exist. You didn't even bother to read the post you linked (which is not an authoritative source; rather it is one person's un-vetted and un-reviewed opinion). The answers to the post read:












In short: don't do it that way unless the term being used is already established, because - as you will see in the wikipedia article - using quotes in that style is used to convey irony or sarcasm.














Look, long-story-short, you can write however you want in whatever style you want, but there are rules to grammar and punctuation, and you ignore those at your peril of failing to convey your message. I, myself, use way too many commas - but that's a problem I'm aware of with my writing. 
Even though by itself "Pay with Paypal" is a valid adjective, the rest of the title still suffers from bad grammar and punctuation.
If you were sticking with that and you absolutely didn't want to use hyphens, you would write "'Pay with PayPal' like" - since the full adjective is the combination of both "Pay with PayPal" and "like". You would not write "Pay with PayPal like" and you would not write "Pay with Paypal" like. 
* "Pay with PayPal"-like &lt;-- correct
* 'Pay with PayPal'-like &lt;-- correct
* "'Pay with PayPal' like" &lt;-- correct
* '"Pay with PayPal" like' &lt;-- correct (but IMO uglier)

You didn't read the article, did you? Did you even look at the demo?
There is no button. A particular eCommerce solution or website might choose to implement a button, as a way of launching the payment gateway, but there is no button "button". Even PayPal doesn't generally use a button anymore since they have the option of paying through merchant services provided by Paypal, with or without an account, and paying through Paypal account, and these options are commonly embedded into the payment screen itself. 
There is no "cut and paste this html code into your web-page" logic involved here. It's about integrating a new payment gateway with existing eCommerce solutions and services. 
Sure, you can always rationalize bad grammar and punctuation along the lines of "I can understand what this means by spending some time thinking about it", but that's not the point. The point is that the title of this post in reference to the article is confusing. The fact that the very first two people to read and respond to it found it confusing literally substantiates that. 
The article could have been about a number of different topics, depending on how a particular person reads the title. For anyone who has been involved in the web for a long time, the most likely reading is that Coinbase is introducing some kind of tipping/donate button. That's something Paypal actually has, and is actually a button. 
I asked around my office and my wife what they thought the phrase referred to and every single one of them indicated a "single click option to pay [or donate] with coinbase". Not one of them read it congruent to the article content.
It is a confusing title, and while you may be able to guess the meaning, it's not explicit or obvious. That's all I've said. EOS.

I don't need your help because you cannot help me. You are not holistically evolved enough to help anyone - start with yourself, then, in ten years, come back and we can have this 'conversation' again.
There are millions of people in this world who no doubt possess wisdom and understanding that I could learn from. You are not one of them. I'm fortunate to have quite eclectic friends and family and to have had a "road less traveled" life. It's ironic. You really don't know me.

This is 100% about the article and the title in reference to the article. You want to write a fiction novel using your own style, go ahead. A title for a news article should convey concisely and in a clear manner the substance of the article. 
You will almost never find that kind of grammatical abuse, the kind of license allowed to creative writing, in a factual or formal setting. It's just confusing. It makes things less clear. The point still remains that the title of this post and the article have next to nothing to do with each other. 
Certainly, there may be buttons, and there even may be a button generator, but that is not at all mentioned in the article. There is not a single reference in that material to support describing it as a payment button. Nor is there any indication in the image you linked that this refers to Coinbase Commerce - the website is ecommerceinsiders, and there is no mention of Coinbase in it. So the most obvious conclusion is that it's a generic button generator. Of course, with a bit more digging, was able to find the source:
