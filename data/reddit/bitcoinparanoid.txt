The AppImage file isn't actually installed, it's just run as it is. Try the following:
Download the AppImage file, right click the file, select Properties then Permissions then put a check mark next to 'Allow the Program to Run as an Executable.' Close the Properties window then double click the AppImage file to run it.

This might be splitting hairs but she's not actually buying Bitcoins in the 7-11, she's adding money to her account with a Bitcoin exchange. She can then buy Bitcoins via the exchange. It's not really the same thing. The title is misleading.
@_date: 2017-01-04 15:54:26
It absolutely will as long as there are no large, trustworthy institutions that will store you Bitcoins for you. Bitcoiners like to say "Be your own Bank!" but they forget that for all they do wrong, Banks provide an extremely high probability that your wealth will be passed on to your next of kin. I'm starting to lose sleep worrying about all the possible ways I could lose my Bitcoins. I don't want to leave them on an exchange because there aren't any that can be trusted as much as a bank.
@_date: 2017-01-16 14:01:28
Yes, they look like they provide a great service. So great in fact, that they don't need to misrepresent what they're doing. You should have just used their description of the video that's on facebook. Otherwise you're stating something that isn't true. You can't just walk into a 7-eleven in the Philippines and buy Bitcoin. You need to already have an existing account with coins.ph.
When I was new to Bitcoin it was posts like this that made learning the ropes more frustrating. Just try to be more accurate in what you post. Your title is way too close to being clickbait.

Can you, or someone else, confirm that having access to 6 words makes it possible to brute force the other 6? As in, possible right now with today's computers?

**Shamir's secret sharing scheme (SSS).**
For me personally, I'm not comfortable asking anyone but immediate family to take responsibility for the safety of my finances. Also, it's beyond what my non-computer savvy parents could understand. They might just throw their hands in the air and give up. Using my scheme, all they have to do is physically get their hands on the 2 packages and take them to a reputable Bitcoin exchange in my home country. I'll add that information to the Package stored with them.
**One Time Pad (OTP).**
Wouldn't that just mean that I'd have to somehow store the one-time pre-shared key with my parents? That seems like it's just adding an unnecessary step. It's turtles all the way down!

Yes, I agree. That's why I'll scratch the BIP39 Mnemonic onto aluminium and also print them on paper.

Thanks for the reply.
Again, I don't really mean to be negative, but it feels like you're trying to re-invent the wheel. A laminated, tamper evident, paper wallet is superior to one that can accidentally be erased by plonking it down next to a strong magnet. Just my opinion, but good luck anyway.
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:23:09
While I agree in the short to mid-term, in the long term, Bitcoin can't keep going up indefinitely. It's going to stabilise at some point and just become a legitimate portion of a properly diversified portfolio. Similar to what Gold is today. We're all getting crazy gains now because we're witnessing the birth of a new asset class.
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:39:10
Thanks. I think I get it. This means that you're adding a private key to the NFC and that normal users won't be able to do this themselves. Am I getting that right?
I mean, it's good, but doesn't it mean I have to trust that you haven't kept a copy of the private key?
Also, now that I think of it, wouldn't these be subject to damage from EMPs and possibly magnets?
Not trying to be negative, just trying to think it through.
@_date: 2017-11-18 09:04:45
I don't agree.
The latest dramas shook my confidence in Bitcoin. That so few people could have such a large effect on the price is not reassuring. 2/3 Bitcoin, 1/3 Altcoins/Tokens is what I feel comfortable with.
I'd recommend Ripple, PowerLedger, ChainLink and Cardano (but only when you can get around 600,000 ADA per bitcoin).
@_date: 2017-11-08 12:33:38
I don't mean to be rude, or rub it in, but I wouldn't spend any money on a lawyer if I were you.
If you look through similar posts to this one you'll see that it was almost always due to the user having weak/reused passwords or inadvertently going to a fake phishing site. Did you use the same password on Bittrex as you do for your email? Google "password best practice" and "bittrex phishing" to see what I mean.
You need to be more careful about what personal information you're giving out on the web. For example, from the email address you've given it's most likely that your first name is John, maybe your last name is Webby, and you're either 58 years old or you were born in 1958. Some immoral people can do an awful lot with information as simple as that.
Please be careful if you're contacted by anyone, you may very well be targeted by scammers promising to get your funds back.
Good luck.

Couldn't I just remove the sticker, read the private key, then transfer the NFC to a new paper wallet with a new tamper evident sticker?

Is it possible the Koreans mistakenly think they're going to "double" their Bitcoin Cash in the upcoming hardfork on the 13th?

What would motivate someone to use such an address?
Last August someone sent 10 bitcoin to it. Why would they do that?

Fair enough. Thanks.

To be clear, I'm only saying it will be banned for making everyday payments. In the same way that right now I can't use gold or yen to pay my electricity bill, I must use dollars. I don't think it will be banned altogether. Like I said, it's only future in most countries is as a "digital gold".
@_date: 2017-10-29 12:22:04
I think it's better to buy now.
If you wait until after the fork you may be forced to choose a winner when it may not be clear who the winner will be. If you buy before the fork you can just wait out all the drama and either continue to hold the loser (if it still exists) or sell it at the market rate.
IMHO if Segwit2X wins, the current Bitcoin will become it's own coin in the style of Ethereum Classic. If the current Bitcoin wins, Segwit2X will probably die a quick death.
@_date: 2017-10-24 07:57:15
Wow. I didn't realise that. Is this true even if BGold successfully implement Replay Protection?
@_date: 2017-10-24 08:40:20
As of this moment, Segwit2X is most likely to go ahead. Saying it has already failed is just factually incorrect . . . I sure hope it does though.
@_date: 2017-10-18 14:53:07
What choice will you have if no one can legally accept it as payment?
@_date: 2017-10-19 02:40:32


Except, that's exactly what they do. Just not 100%. Your local coffee shop or hardware store, and 99% of all other merchants, are not  going to accept Bitcoin in the face of a government ban.
@_date: 2017-10-25 02:23:33
Thanks so much for all your hard work. I just find it strange that there isn't an equivalent document/plan for the Segwit2x hardfork. I might be wrong, but this seems to be a more serious threat than previous Bitcoin dramas.
@_date: 2017-10-24 02:20:27
I think the problem is that difficulty doesn't drop for a very long time. 2 Weeks, I think. I'm not sure Bitcoin Legacy can survive 2 weeks of downtime while Segwit2X is working perfectly well.
I was hoping that an emergency hard fork to reduce the difficulty was in preparation by the Bitcoin Core developers.
@_date: 2017-10-18 08:03:54
Yep, it's great, but I'm not talking about technical limitations, I'm saying that alternative payments options will simply be banned.
@_date: 2017-10-29 07:42:28
The biggest problem with this is that if Segwit2X wins, and takes the Bitcoin ticker name BTC, you'll be left with nothing, or at least BT1 coins that are probably worth a small fraction of the original. You should leave some Bitcoin unsplit as a form of insurance.

Will faith quicken the readjustment of difficulty? If so, hallelujah!

I don't think that Bitcoin, or any other cryptocurrency, will achieve mainstream use as a currency. Bitcoin will only ever be a "digital gold" and governments will crack down on people not paying tax on their capital gains. There will probably be an amnesty followed by harsh fines for not declaring your cryptocurrency investments.
I think that most governments will transfer their own currencies to a blockchain to make it's tracking transparent to the tax office. They'll ban the use of any other payment system than their own. Then they'll force businesses to use their blockchain and, at least at the start, individuals will be able to voluntarily give up their privacy in return for not having to submit tax returns. It'll all be done automatically by the government and they'll know your net worth at any given time.
I doubt you'll be able to use their blockchain without having an account with a bank and you'll use the system for daily payments in the same way you use debit cards now. Cash will most probably be phased out completely within 20-30 years.
Overall, I think the efficiency gains and the ability to crack down on organised crime and tax evaders will be worth the loss of privacy.

I'm guessing they create a set number of B2X tokens on their own exchange and promise to honour it when the times comes. Whoever buys the token is then free to sell it on their exchange. I wonder how they went about setting the opening price though?
Their B2X price is significantly higher than Bitfinex's. I'm not sure why.

Also, u/SatoshiDundee, I don't think your path is correct. Since Google satellite images can be up to 3 years old, I don't think his shipping container setup appears in the Google satellite images yet.
I think he's made a critical mistake uploading the video. He must have assumed the location wouldn't be easy to identify. I wonder if we'll ever hear from him again?

@_date: 2017-06-15 01:07:35
We don't have direct access to all the evidence so both of us are just  speculating. My problem with you and other Ulbricht supporters is that your belief in his innocence (and the Christ-like, hero worship) is unreasonable on the information available.
Without knowing for sure, it's pretty likely that he wasn't prosecuted for the fake assassinations because the agents involved in setting those up were themselves arrested and jailed.
If you believe it's a conspiracy, then it's a pretty shitty conspiracy. They couldn't even keep the corrupt agents from being arrested, prosecuted and jailed. All done, by the way, by the very same "big government" you accuse of framing Ulbricht.
Finally, if you think enabling the supply of herion and meth is a victimless crime then we'll never be able agree on anything.
@_date: 2017-05-24 11:57:37
Ha ha! It's shameful, no doubt . . . but it's pretty hilarious too.
@_date: 2017-06-15 03:41:32
While I don't agree that the evidence of that is available to us for the attempted murders is "extremely flimsy" (this article seems pretty reasonable:  I do agree that you're right about my comment being a cheap shot. I apologise for that and my only excuse is that I'm annoyed that a person who's admitted to enabling and profiting from the supply of heroin, crack and meth can be hero worshipped by so many.
I'll edit my original comment to reflect this.
@_date: 2017-06-14 23:23:48
. . . and have people killed.
*Ross Ulbricht*
EDIT: I apologise for this cheap shot. Here's a copy of one of my replies from below:


@_date: 2017-06-01 06:24:17


I can't understand where you're coming from. What about the assassinations he ordered?
@_date: 2017-06-01 11:11:55
I don't know. It just seems too conspiratorial and thin.
There was no shortage of evidence for the drug charges and he's even admitted that he created the site. I think the chats for the fake assassinations were over a significant amount of time, there's a lot of unnecessary risk involved if they wanted to fake it.
Apparently there's evidence that some chats were deleted from the database, but that's very different from inserting records into a database. You'd have to be a semi proficient database professional to be able to insert records without it showing up under a forensic investigation. 
He wasn't charged with being a "website administrator" he was charged facilitating the sale of an unprecedented amount of hard drugs, and taking his cut as well.
It's more likely that the Bitcoin transactions do match up with whatever records the undercover agent kept and that's why there's no mention of it. You'd think the undercover agent would have reports to their superiors to fall back on as well.
I don't think Ross's defence is saying the chat logs are fake, I think Ross claims that it wasn't him operating the DPR account at the time, it was someone else. If he can't come up with evidence of that then it's asking too much for anyone to believe that he started as DPR and finished as DPR but it wasn't really him in the middle.
@_date: 2017-06-01 08:23:33
Hey, thanks for the reasonable reply.
Am I right in assuming that the assassination accusations rely on it being proven that Ross Ulbricht was DPR?
Isn't it true that he was logged on as DPR when he was arrested?
If he was still using the DPR log in when arrested, it's pretty likely that he's DPR.
Still, it's very difficult to get an even handed overview of the whole case. The wikipedia article is very weak and doesn't seem to be up-to-date.
@_date: 2017-06-01 09:38:17
What's their motive? The already had him bang to rights on all the drug stuff.
Also, large payments were made for the fake assassinations. I assume the payments were made in Bitcoin. If so, it should be trivial to match up the timestamps of the Bitcoin transactions with the chat logs.
There was also at least one faked assassination scene that had the involvement of the intended victim, maybe the only evidence of this is on the chats logs as well? Not sure, but the intended victim would be able to testify whether this occurred before or after Ross Ulbricht was arrested. Possibly the movements of the agents and the intended victim could be corroborated to have occurred before his arrest.
