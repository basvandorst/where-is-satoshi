you dont want it in an exchange when it clones, you want it on a paper wallet where you know the private keys, bitaddress.org can generate a wallet. That way you can go somewhere to get the forked bitcoin yourself. People who had bitcoin when it forked with bitcoin gold still cannot access it and may never be able to, because the coinbase controls those keys.

then you did a market sell, and with that you are at the mercy of the market makers.

Ok let me elaborate. Bitcoin will always and forever be bitcoin. When a fork happens the Blockchain is replicated to a new coin. You can use your public and private keys to unlock that new coin, but your bitcoin is always to be the same. Example: if you had bitcoin before the bitcoin cash fork, you can unlock the same amount of bcash that you had in bitcoin.
