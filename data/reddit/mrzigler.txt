Interesting point, however as they say in business may be leaving serious revenue on the table.
For example to deter spam and Takara could charge a fee per "vanity token" drop.  Set a time limit, for example a user would pay a fee to drop their "vanity token" and it would be active for so many months, then if it isn't claimed, it could be refunded automatically to the address that dropped it.

A block is generated on average once every 10 mins.
After the blocksize limit is increased (looks like &lt; or = 8MB next fork) then there will be room for more transactions true.
However, more transactions (assuming bitcoin contiues to grow) would have more waitng in a mempool until the next block is found?
I can see how having a higher blocksize limit would allow the miners to wipe out the backlog faster however, I don't see how it would stop a spammer from causing a large mempool backlog between blocks like today.
The original person I was replying to, seemed to be arguing that a larger blocksize would have preventing the problem we saw today, I don't see how it could.

I see F2POOL is going to first seen.
I was not aware that Peter's original RBF allowed changing how the inputs are spent.  I was thinking it was like  the new transaction still spends to the same outputs. This is known as "honest" or "first seen safe" replace by fee.
If he was proposing to make true zero conf double spends then that would be a problem in part.
However, I do understand the point he is trying to make, that the current zero conf payments are not as secure as people are told.
I do not believe his intention was malice, but it may have been undiplomatic.

I would add that an increased blocksize limit (OP's stawman) would not have stopped this problem.

I think the Lawsky event is already starting to backfire on the big banks.
Right now BTC is only held by a tiny percentage of the population.
Most of the individuals involved with BTC and crypto are anti-central banking, securities monopoly.   These people spend most of their spare time thinking of ways to "route around" regulations that are written to defend the central power monopolies.
If Lawsky or others like him would have done this back in 2012 or before they may have been able to crush it.   
However, if Lawsky or others had waited another year or so when BTC was being used by a greater percentage of the population (i. e. more people who could care less about fighting the power monopolies), then those "bitcoin sheep" would embrace the regulation and it would be much more difficult to fight.
As I see it, the Lawsky event happened at precisely the best possible time.  Bitcoin and they people involved are big enough to fight it.  AND there is still a high percentage of people involved in it who are all about ending the power monopoly.

Yes I read the whitepaper among other things.
bitcoin's real value is the public ledger (solving the byzantine general problem).   The un seizable storage of value. (if proper security is taken).
The POS for small transactions must be moved off the main ledger.  People who want the anonymity or use of the public ledger will pay for the resources.  Because, the block size is finite.
Now, I may be willing to support a move to increase the block size from 1mb to 2mb or 3mb etc.... but that is still only a interim solution until third party POS system (for small transactions) can be implemented.

As a group they have abused their stewardship of positions of power and authority.  Their members control over 90 percent of the resources on the planet.  They could use that position to uplift humanity, instead they have been using their wealth as a weapon to push the lower classes on earth around, as bullies.
As such they have forfeited their stewardship and any right to rule.

An old windows (XP for example) with a truecrypt 7.1a that is airgapped, should be good.
Linux would be good too, (also airgapped).  Linux is more of an advantage live (connected online).  With just air gapped, than it is less of an issue.
In my experience a USB stick is most likely to fail (be un-recoverable), burned DVD seem to be about equal over time to harddrives however, the damage (Scratches, etc) to DVDs make them more likely to fail as opposed to regular harddrives (speaking from experience).
My point being that recoverability is just as much a security concern as preventing outside theft.

Failure to recover can be as big a security threat as outside exposure.
Save the private keys (encrypted, pgp or truecrypt etc) and keep mutiple copies at many locations.

Running a node bitcoin or other crypto without authorization on someone else's network is something I can't condone.
As far as you using 50x in one hour of what a whole Core node uses in a week, I find this hard to believe.
I've ran Core, Litecoin, Namecoin and many others.  I know the real bandwith usage and for Core (more than 8 connections) it is NOT a trivial amount by any measure and if someone was running in on any network (where I was admin) without my consent, I would bring the ban hammer down without hesitation.

They don't even have a majority.
This is a well funed astroturf Campaign.  It is much less exspensive to create division within the bitcoin community and push for the hard fork that will devide closest to the middle (thereby enabling a more cost effective 51 % attack) than spend resources attacking a united community.
Remember, people this is an economic war of attrition.  They want to spend the least amount of resources per military objective.

It would be much easier to get consensus for raising the hard limit to 2mb or even 4mb in 2016.  
This would avoid a costly fork war.  
Then later as bitcoin grows we can re-examine increasing the limit again.

In the USA the velvet glove must come off.
Because of the public ledger, and the anti-centralization nature of Bitcoin, it can "route around" conventional regulation.
In the USA laws and regulation no matter how oppressive are still made to appear as to not violate freedom of speech rights etc.
With the expansion of money transmitter regulations we can now see the very naked root of the true purpose of these laws.
Someone (who did NOT deal in fiat USD btw) received a letter from FinCEN simply for putting a random set of characters beginning with "5" on a coin and sending them to people.

Taxing it so heavily that the USA misses out on the real bitcoin economic boom.
We are already falling down the list relative to the rest of the world in exchange volume and adoption.
If bitcoin goes to 10k or 100k per coin for example then taxing it at the bullion level would be extremely confiscatory to the point that people and capital movement already fleeing the USA would massively accelerate. 
Now if the real powers in the USA have any wisdom to remain relevant in a bitcoin world they would want to tax it as legal tender, i. e. reasonable level of taxes.

Anyone who thinks the block size can be increased to serve as a general micro-transaction network (i. e. VISA, MASTER-CARD etc) is delusional.
As transaction volume grows the big payment point of sale processors  (i. e. Bitpay)must build off chain point of sale networks to take the pressure off the blockchain.
The blockchain is only needed as a way to transfer large funds over distances, and a secure store of value.

The purpose of Central bank controlled inflationary fiat currency is to transfer the productivity of the laboring class to the families own control the central banks.  (this also includes their friends and allies).
One effect is the freezing of class, i. e. the amount of "hard work" it takes to escape the bottom of the economic ladder increases continually.
Another effect is in investing and manufacturing the incentive is planned obsolesce, etc.
A stable or even slightly deflationary currency balances the scales back to labor and engineering (making stuff to last) quality.

After you get your device, IF there is a significant jump in how the world values bitcoin (relative to fiat, etc), much greater than the difficulty then there may be a window before others jump in to mine where you may be able to profit.
As more hashing power enters the network to mine bitcoin then it gets less profitable per hash rate.

Of course there is a point to mining after March 31, 2014.
However, your question is will you be able to make a profit.
At this point it looks like a negative, but the price of bitcoin could spike faster than hash difficulty when you get your hashing device, therefor opening up a window for you to make a profit.

There are court cases that imply that the IRS only can tax legal tender and transactions into and out of legal tender at the face value.
For example there are a few court cases where the IRS was trying to tax the bullion value of 1oz gold coins minted by the US mint with a legal tender face value of $50.  The IRS argued to tax the bullion content (much higher), however the courts have ruled they could only tax it on the $50 face value.
A similar argument could be made with bitcoin or congress will have to declare bitcoin legal tender.

I am not suggesting that congress sets 1BTC=50USD as a legal tender.
I am saying that if congress did declare bitcoin to be legal tender, then they could tax it as a percentage the same way they do Fiat AND taxes could be paid in BTC without going back to Fiat.
For example a retailer receives Fiat they subtract wages, cost of product, building and maintenance, etc. Then if there is any left over, that is what they pay taxes on to the IRS.  They could do the same with bitcoin treating it as legal tender and the average retailer and consumer would pay about the same taxes (but now in the form of BTC instead of FRN).
If the IRS and courts treat BTC transactions as a hugh gain and try to force the taxing of it as the inflated dollar amount without respecting BTC as a real currency then the tax burden becomes high enough to cause capital to flee the USA.
Is that better?

The transaction limit of the Blocks is going to be a huge opportunity for a payment processor to integrate a POS (point of sale system) that combines many "off-blockchain" into few "on-blockchain" transactions.

If for example Bitpay started a debit card service funded with bitcoin and then they handled the general retail transactions off-chain, there would be 2 big advantages.
1. Moving a huge and growing number of transactions off the chain, thereby saving blockspace.
2. A Bitpay, bitcoin debit card would be adopted by a greater percentage of the general public who are used to swiping plastic and don't want to deal with the technical stuff (i. e. this bitcoin is complicated to buy stuff with folks).

You should be able to use BitPay integrated on you site to handle some of the record keeping making it seamless and keeping track of individual donations for tax write off purposes.
You can also post a bitcoin address, on the site for "almost" anonymous donations.
However, even using just one address people can attached their identity to donations by signing the transaction donation.
BitPay will make the record keeping easier and I believe they offer 100 percent conversion to Fiat (for 501(c) 3s) if you desire.

Bitcoin will have value as a store of value (like no other), and as a trust-less decentralized system (i. e. no central point of attack).
These are the things that give it value, and I believe if it succeeds it will be worth more than 10k to 100k dollars per coin or zero within a few years.
Massively increasing the blocksize in an attempt to accommodate all transactions WILL centralize control of bitcoin to a degree that it loses its only real value.
However, assuming Bitpay does build a good Point of sale network to combine many micro transactions off-chain into few on-chain transactions, I would expect Bitpay to have a market value comparable to one of the biggest Corps in the world today.
If the folks at Bitpay make the mistake that the blocksize will be continually expanded so they do not have to invest in an off-chain point of sale network, then there are 2 possibility.
1. Another company does this and Bitpay misses the boat.
2. Blocksize is expanded to the point that the bitcoin network gets centralized to the point where it loses its value and is replaced by something else.

People investing in Bitcoin should have been aware and prepared for the volatility.
I really have no sympathy for people who bought in near ATH only to panic sell.
Only invest in BTC what you are prepared to lose i. e. send it to cold storage and be prepared to sit on it for 6 months to a year or more.
I have most of my BTC in cold storage, I have some in a hot wallet for spending (merchants that accept BTC), and a small amount in my trading account.
I have made some extra "profit" in BTC over the last year doing some short term trades, but since I cannot perfectly time the tops and bottoms, sometimes I have been "underwater" for a few days or weeks at the most.

Once it crosses back into 4 digits for more than a few days , it will never return to triple digits again.

The moral argument for price discovery ( and for money, currency itself) in a market, is to fairly allocate a limited resource.
In this case the limited resource is space in a block.
Instead of fighting fees one should be thinking about possible different types of information compression to get more transaction space within a megabyte.

@_date: 2013-12-06 22:08:22
I'll put it this way.
I first invested in a few BTC in late 2012 (in hindsight, like most I wish I bought more).
I had buy orders in for $90 a BTC, that got filled when Silk Road got seized.
Only sold one BTC since then (for over $1k).
I am in for the long term and have buy orders ready.
I won't disclose my buy order price, but it is lower than what BTC is at now.
In my opinion this is only a temporary dip, that could be over in a week or a month.
However, I believe it could go lower relative to Fiat, between now and then.
The Empire striking back this week was no surprise to me.

And the average early accredited investor who bought Twitter pre IPO had better returns than those who bought and held BTC since 2011 (or even before).
That is the real reason why they (the 1 percenters) hate BTC.
They hide the real gains pre IPO and only accredited investors and co-founders (corporate officers) get those 1,000% and up gains per year.
They could not stop the average blue color non accredited investor from acquiring BTC and receiving the gains that have been only reserved for the elite wealthy.
And they HATE Bitcoin for that.
The rent seekers HATE with a passion anything that allows the wage slave to potentially achieve financial freedom.
That is the real reason they hate BTC.

Telling people how to live their private lives off the clock is NOT the same thing as paying a fair wage for someone's labor.  If an employer offers and pays fair compensation for the labor or services of others, they have no moral obligation to offer it in the King's Fiat.
Telling employees to "fist a cup of urine" IS a moral wrong.  That is the difference.

They do have a point.
For example people could use BTC to buy Linden Bucks for micro-transactions and only use BTC for the larger transactions.
As BTC grows, more micro-transactions will have to move off-chain eventually.
Other players will enter the "bitcoin economy" who provide the service of combining many off-chain micro-transactions into few larger transactions that get settled on the chain.
Linden Bucks can provide such a service at this time.
