Why miners support bigger blocks ? Surely they earn more with higher transaction fee blocks than lower ?
@_date: 2018-06-12 07:09:49
That can’t work if BTC is too volatile, no? With fiat you know something is pretty much always worth x.     
@_date: 2018-06-07 14:32:26

During the bull run in December 2017, we probably got tons of new people in Bitcoin,, TX fee got really high for a while, do you think this gave them a bad image of Bitcoin?     
" I just bought 0.04 BTC on coinbase, sent them to my wallet. What ? Only received 0.02?     
Wtf ? Sending to my wallet cost me half of my Bitcoin worth $xx. What is this useless thing ? "
