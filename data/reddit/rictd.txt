coinsquare.io in Canada
@_date: 2017-12-31 02:36:17

@_date: 2017-12-30 15:35:24

sell them privately, like on Kijiji.
offer them at a small discount and I bet you buyers will line up cash in hand
this is my plan when I want to liquidate

depends on your trading horizon
the 1M, 5M, 15M, 30M, 1H charts look bearish
1D and higher are clearly bullish

The gap between Bitfinex vs Gdax /Gemini is closing. Bitfinex is typically at $1000 discount. What's up with that?

I had an issue with an older PC downloading the entire chain very slow turned out to be a bad hard disk. Put an SSD in and it only took a few hours. Not likely the OP’s issue but somebody else may benefit from this wisdom

very nice zappadoing !
since you are using PHP may I suggest using number_format( $price , 0 );
drop the pennies, add the thousand separator

sorry but your credibility went out the door when your facts about this were clips from the film scary movie

like a windows shortcut, you don't move the bin to /usr/local/bin you just place a shortcut there.
ln -s /home/me/bitcoin/bin/bitcoin /usr/local/bin/bitcoin
that way you can work with the source code in your home directory and not need to move binaries around every time you compile
@_date: 2019-12-09 15:32:08
alternatively, you can leave it where it sits and simply make an alias to the bins in /usr/local/bin
