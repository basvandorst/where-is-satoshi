Life extension is important. But the quality of life is also important. I hope you will contribute to the life of the community of Crimean refugees, which are trying to survive after russian aggression. We will be grateful for any kind of donation.

Looks like you were born in russia. It is a very rich country, since it can afford to attack weaker countries like Georgia and Ukraine, and live under all those sanctions. I personally now have a lot of work with refugees from Crimea after russian aggression. You cannot image how much people are suffering.

To advertise my local business I'd rather pay Facebook for ads and get much higher ROI then for example print leaflets and give some kid to disseminate it. For the cost of printing and kid's salary I get much higher ROI on Facebook
