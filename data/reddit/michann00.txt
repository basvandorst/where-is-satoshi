Anything to help.

I am another CFS/ME patient. Up until June I was a 1st grade teacher. I loved teaching and even though I started teaching later than most teachers I had found my calling. ME/CFS has taken it away from me. Unless a cure is found, I’ll never be able to teach again because I have to stop what I’m doing as soon as I start to feel tired...not something you can do as a teacher. I’ve been bedridden since the last day of school. I can count on 1 half the amount of times I’ve been able to do something since then. One of them is I made it to my 14 YO daughter’s play at a local theater last night. I have paid for going because I’ve now slept all day, feeling that awful pre-flu feeling. 
Along with the physical fatigue I went from working on my masters thesis to being unable to read much. On a good day I can read an easy YA book for maybe 30 mins. 
The OMF is helping fund research to help the millions of us that are missing from life. OP, if you have a chance, watch Unrest, it’ll give you an idea of what we are fighting for. I’d even be willing to send you an Amazon gift card to rent or buy it, just to help bring awareness. 
No matter what you decide, thank you. What a wonderful gift.

Can’t wait to hear. While I have a couple I’d love to see, it’s also been fun to learn about other great causes.

I’d like to add Open Medical Foundation (OMF) again. For me, it’s personal because after 9 years as a teacher I hit a wall with Chronic Fatigue Syndrome that was so severe I went from being a recipient of the Gates Foundation for Educational Leadership and got to go to ECET2 to learn how to become a better teacher and to help others while staying in the classroom to now being bedridden. I loved teaching and after 10 yrs in the wrong business had found something I am passionate about. So much so I recommended to kickme444 that Redditgifts should do a teacher gifting. I helped figure out the details on the teacher end and got teachers to sign up. 
At this point there is no end in sight. The last 3 nights I’ve had to sit and comfort my 14 YO daughter because she witnessed a shutdown aka crash where my muscles started jumping, I started crying uncontrollably and couldn’t stand on my own 2 feet without collapsing. I couldnt put words together because my brain wouldn’t work...All because I went to her community theater performance of Best Christmas Pageant Ever. 
This is my story and there are millions more around the world who are now missing from their lives because of this horrible “Syndrome”

Wasn’t me. I just found out first.
