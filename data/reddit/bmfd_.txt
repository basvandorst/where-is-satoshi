Haha, no problem! I think we've all been there. First few transactions can be quite scary, especially when it takes a while to receive them, but it'll be fine. A few days ago I made a transaction with a fee of 10.2 sat/byte and it got comfirmed within 2 minutes. There are more transactions on the network at this moment, so it will take a little longer to get yours confirmed, but you shouldn't have to wait much longer.

8.5 sat/byte is fine, you got nothing to worry about and you probably won't have to wait much longer to receive your funds, since the mempool is quite empty. It will arrive within a few hours, if not sooner.

Not directly, but exchanges have allot of transactions, so if there is a wallet with allot of txns, you can assume it's an exchange. You can also try to trace a transaction and see where it ends up.

I’m sorry, but you got scammed. 
@_date: 2018-03-28 22:46:30
There is no guarantee for that. If that would be the case, everyone would be buying at this price. 
@_date: 2018-03-12 17:12:57
Well, I think that even in a bear market the price wont stabilize, since the price will still fluctuate quite heavily. So the current bear market doesn't necessarily make it more usable in my opinion.

Stop spamming this sub with useless posts, you posted something familiar 10 minutes ago. If you're really that insecure about your investment that you need Reddit-users to reassure you, it might be better to not invest at all.

Eventhough I partly agree and I’d rather see much less talking and complaining about the price, that’s what happens when crashes like this happen. People turn to this sub to give reassurance and hope to eachother.

Thanks for the quality post.

I think that they are highly incompetent and that they are trying to mislead investors for their own gain. So yes, in my opinion they are a scam.

I think it has similarities with a gambling addiction. The thrive of making a good trade, getting irritated when a trade doesn't turn out as expected. Having the feeling that you're missing out on lots of opportunities when you decide not to trade. Having the urge to frequently check the prices to see if everything is going according to plan etc. At least, that was my experience for a while. Luckily I became aware of the fact that it was affecting me too much and I decided to spend allot less time on trading and checking prcies.

Not at all, feel free to do so. Good luck writing your article:)

Can we stop spamming this sub with useless posts like this? Nobody knows for sure whats going to happen. Just do whatever you think is the most likely.

Eventhough it's still awful, he did a *suicide attempt*, but he survived. Your title is a bit misleading.

But what if this is reverse psychology and you are trying to manipulate us by telling us to hold? So we shouldn't be hodling and start daytrading?

Tim Draper made a prediction in 2014 (when BTC was at $400) that BTC would hit $10.000 in 2018.

I personally don't mind, but if I don't like something, I'm not going to spend my time on it, because it would be a total waste. I've got better things to do.

That probably has to do with Twitter their algorithm screwing up. They automatically ban accounts that are trying to scam others (Send 1 Ether and I’ll send you 10 in return bla bla) and they mistakenly considered you to be a scammer aswell. They should fix this asap, because way too many people are getting banned by mistake.

I don’t mean this offensive, but I’m wondering: by looking at your posthistory it becomes clear that you’re not the biggest fan of Bitcoin, but why do you spend your time on mocking bitcoin then? It’s totally fine if you don’t like it or don’t have any confidence in the technology, but why would you still waste your time on it? 
@_date: 2018-04-04 16:49:33
That’s such an idiotic thing to do
@_date: 2018-04-29 19:25:49
Crashing their support will probably be counterproductive.

I remember getting annoyed about the fact that some coins in my portfolio were underperforming when they only went up with 20% in 24h.

You're being such a retard. If you're going to call someone out, make sure you're quoting the right person. Because in this case you're quoting the wrong person, OP just commented on that post.

If Bitcoin doesn’t hit $1M, McAfee will just pull some stunt like buying 0.001 BTC for $1000 which results in $1M per BTC.
