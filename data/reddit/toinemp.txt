Well there were talks of wall street manipulating the price, forcing it down, big traders and banks making profits. It was all dismissed when price went from 16k to 19k, but now it seems even more obvious. Is it stupid to think this is what happened ?

You deposit $1k on an exchange to buy tether to buy bitcoin (maybe someone else does). The exchange then uses the $1k to buy more bitcoin. When they realize this works, they create tether out of thin air to buy bitcoin with it. 
And they're making interest on your trades on a bitcoin valued at a price that would've never actually existed !

Yes you're right, what he's saying is if you can buy the antminer with fiat but that depends on what you have availible.
Also take into account the heat from the antminer can be taken away from the heating bill in winter, which reduces what you think you'll paye for it.

The same way I deal now with not picking the winning lottery numbers.
At that time, bitcoin could have crashed a big way, and you would have had regrets the other way.
Still is now, people are not investing by fear of it crashing.
There might already be the new thing that will do x1000 out there, but you don't know which one it is and won't be able to until it's done.

If bitcoin goes to 0 you lost .25 btc which is currently approx 5000 usd.
If you mine all year and bitcoin goes to zero you lose .25btc + electricity (approx 10k with your math).
Different strategies for different visions I guess. If they change anything, if your antminer is broken, you lose a lot more. There's always a risk somewhere

I have some litecoin, I did read all the comments and they are very informative sadly I don't have time to reply to all. Sadly I just hodl because I don't get practice, paying with my phone scanning a qr code still looks like wizardry, and my friends don't own any so I can't even use that to transfer money to them. I can't get them into it by transferring 5 dollars because I feel like there will be 10 dollars in fee or a long wait. To be honest I have never tried. I'm lazy, I would like an app that says transfer X amount to "scan qr code" and boum. Choosing fees, trying to guess how long it will take. I just don't find a reason for it yet when I can send it with 0 fee via PayPal.
I'd love to be bankless, to be honest but I'm just waiting for it to be more widely used and I thought we could "play pretend" with my friends, and I'm going to look into testnet
@_date: 2019-06-02 11:38:54
What about transaction fees

and some smart noobs will sell high and buy back lower, taking profits over you.
If you see it crashing sell.
Then buy back when it's lower

I've got to admit it makes up for yesterday night.
Thought Litecoin was going up, went all in. Btc went up, bought btc. Then btc went down but ltc went up so bought ltc. guess what ltc went down btc went up. Ended up losing 1% when both of them went up 12%.
Kicked myself in the face all day long, and this evening makes it a little bit better.
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:46:42
This has always been my dream car, unfortunately even though I looked at them plenty of time, I never invested in bitcoins. I only did the jump a month ago and purchased a little bit of bitcoin. 
I wish one day I'll be able to afford a tesla as well, but for now I'm looking at the model 3 to buy with my salary in a few years. At least I've managed to get my dream job so I got that going for me which is nice :)
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:15:22
You might be right, I'm the worst and today has made me hate myself.
I thought ltc was about to jump but brokers said btc will. went all in on btc, LTC jumped. FOMOed, went all in on ltc, btc jumped. They both took 14% and I managed to get 0% of that. Yay me.
Then I wanted to sold but figured I'd wait a bit. And look at that.
Now I sold, not looking back, I'm ready to buy more when it's low enough, don't care if it's not the bottom of the dip, I'll make money...
@_date: 2019-06-02 19:58:00
But why pay 0,02 to transfer 5$?
I get it for transferring large amounts of money oversea, or to get money out of the banks, but for small amounts it doesn't make sense yet unless you have no fiat left.
Anyway thanks for the help, if I can get people to use testnet more people will look into it.

How long is it gonna take for bitcoin to take down that 10k sell wall ?
Time is risk, losses are very minor. If bitcoin can't break 10k and does go back down, I'll be winning.
If bitcoin breaks 10k and goes up, I'll be winning, slightly less.
If bitcoin breaks 10k and crashes, I'll be losing, a bit more than you. 
We'll see. It's my strategy, doesn't have to be yours.

Thanks for the constructive reply.
If you don't mind a further question :
Distribution of wealth : we didn't give some people a lot of money and some others no money. People accumulated more and more money over generations, work, or inventions / building companies. People either accepted that or didn't buy iPhone, windows, etc...
It's not like we said hey guys here's our new money, those who knew that 8 years ago are now the richest people in the world.
Here, people who don't have bitcoin won't want it considered as the new money as they don't have any theirself. Why would wealthy people pay 50k/bitcoin when others got them for 6 cents a piece. They would end up poor. They'd rather not use bitcoin and keep their advantage.

So it's gonna take down a huge 10k wall and then only go up by 5, and then crash ?
What are the odds of it crashing before 10k vs the odds of it crashing after ? If it's better than 50% I'll take my chances thank you
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:08:16
That advice I'll take. I thought the fact it broke the 10k wall would be enough to launch a big move up.
If you can argue smartly otherwise I would happily listen.
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:47:53
Ok guys found why that was. Everytime you click on reception on your btc address it creates a new walled even though you don't do anything.
That's why. Got me scared for a few minutes there ...

Record transactions for tax history ? I know nothing about this to be honest.
My wild guess was that at the end of the year you look at what you have versus what you put in and pay taxes on that.

I could pretty much draw 1000 other functions that "kinda match" bitcoin price to give very different results.
And by the way a logarithmic curve on a logarithmic scale is as straight line on a normal chart ...

Thank you for your answer.
Sorry for my apparent dumbness, I've got knowledge in programming and all but I'm quite exhausted by work right now and trying to pick up trading this week end was not the best time.
You've perfectly answered my question, I'll read about it when things settle down.

I'll take things I know nothing about for $400
Thanks for the reply, mind explaining what you are talking about ? I'm googling API, not sure how long that's gonna take to wrap my head around.

The thing is the website says : new addresses are automatically created for each payment, and stay associated with your account.
Does it mean they could be normal and created for when I bought bitcoins ? (even though not on these days ?)
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:26:35
lol what ? Who are you saying this to ?
I'm not able to reade the future, hence I sold at nearly 10k taking the risk of losing .5% instead of taking the risk of it losing 20%. 
Maybe I'll make less money, maybe I won't. There's no "losing money". 
And you call that illogical thinking ...
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:22:24
Buy things in bitcoin. 
If you bought a ticket for a concert at 20$ and it sells for 300$ months later you're not gonna get taxed as long as you don't sell it.
Just buy things with bitcoin, and wish good luck to anyone trying to prove you made a profit.
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:09:21
I don't think that's how it works where I live, plus I'm a student so my profits are enough to pay for a good restaurant and a movie, not sure the irs would be interested ^^

Yep, bank transfer not working over week end, credit carded maxed out.
I'm still not over that
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:41:25
That's what I thought but how do you explain addresses were created on days that I didn't buy any bitcoins ? Is that normal ?
And I did like 5 purchases of bitcoins and only have 2 addresses

I agree with the message in itself UT in now way this is what's explained in that cartoon. You're just expected to extrapolate

Never understood this. It's meant to show that we follow stuff without trying them by ourself as a bad thing. It... Isn't? If a monkey was to climb that ladder they would get the water sprayed.
In my life of work we always say learn from others mistake you won't be alive long enough to try them all yourself. We do stuff we don't always understand and it keeps us alive.

10% drop from what? Because if it's everytime it goes down 10% from week's ath  you're not going to have enough money. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:08:20
Lost 10k since ATH, was up 9k ... Still hodling.
My logic is : it will have a use once the price is stable, people can't risk buying/selling with something that goes up or down 70% in a month and 20+% in a day. Until then, the gamble is to know which coin is going to succeed. 
By then, when price is stable (less than 1% variation in a day and no more than 5% in a month) people will want to use it, everyone ... That gives a market cap bigger than any other currency which is country/geographically limited. Until then, I'm an early adopter, and we'll see in the long run.
