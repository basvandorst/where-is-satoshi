I want Bernie to win so bad I'm scared making statements like this will automatically kill any chances he had considering the power of money in the country.

Politics tends to be deciding between two evils rather than getting what you really want.

If you really think about what money is then you'll see what I think they meant by worthless.What really is fiat paper money anyway? Its this thin piece of colored paper that acts as a promise from the issuing government that said paper rectangle can be exchanged for an equal amount of goods or services. 
Really, at the end of the day it is only worth what people decide its worth. The governments promise means nothing, US currency isn't goldbacked anymore, the Federal Reserve (which acts independently of the government) could easily devalue that piece of paper by creating more of it. You can say I'm a pessimist but in my mind the unreliability of people, the government, and - in the US case - the FS is too much to consider the current system stable/reliable enough to be sustainable for the future. 
Maybe we will see the time come when people collectively decide centralized currency is worthless and don't use it anymore. Until then, I feel like it's important to get the clear message out that in the grand scheme of history fiat has never been more worthless. At least before now having money meant you own the equivalent gold or whatever precious metal and you were entitled to exchange for that metal at a bank.
I hope this comment made sense because  damn that was rambly.
