I don't necessarily mean they encrypted the drives. I'm saying you generally can't use computer A to access user account data from a hard drive connected from Computer B. Normally you'd need to boot the drive from Computer B, login to that user, and than can access the files.
Unless your saying I can just vaguely search for "wallet.dat", it will return results, and if I get a hit can go much further.
Some of the drives might be formated and some may even have windows 95/98 on them if it were even possible to run a wallet on 32-bit systems.

I was thinking this as well. Just speculating my options before I jump into this. Odds of finding anything are probably worse than getting Blackjack 10 times in a row... My logic is someone could have had a wallet with a measly 20 BTC and at the time was worth less than $5 they forgot about and got rid of their computer.

Thanks for such a fast first reply! I realize this would be the best first option, though I'm in the understanding the actual wallet.dat file would be stored in the users appdata. Are encrypted system folders such as appdata, etc searchable without the actual need to boot the drive from original hardware? Basically have 10ish drives I kept from junk desktops from second-hand stores.

I've always thought BitCoin was continually an ongoing project. Daily developers were updating BitCoin code to become adaptable in real-world situations. The ability to process a BitCoin transaction in 5 seconds or less for under $0.10. Such speeds and low cost would cause retailers online and brick and mortar to prefer crypto over Visa. Now your telling me this isn't BitCoin's vision? No development is being made? Just a bunch of people buying cheap, selling high, and continuing the process? Basically "stock" without a business to support it's value?

Just thought it to be funny is all. Obviously this wasn't a mining setup, just looks like one with cables thrown together.

Tho if you bought at $40 or $4... You'd have to be crazy to have not sold at $15k or higher... It's called greed if they were expecting more.

Someone has to be behind BitCoin and I'm not talking about Satoshi. Satoshi did develop and create BitCoin and Blockchain technology. However, he stopped being a developer once it was created. So for the past 9 years someone has to be continuing the BitCoin vision.

I think part of the problem in the photo is the windows are closed! Director didn't account for heat...

Thank you!

Not endorsing fraud with my comment, but wouldn't it be as simple as downloading Coinomi wallet, sending those funds there, using in-app exchange to ETH, transferring the ETH to another new Coinomi account, in-app exchanging ETH for a privacy coin like zCash, send that ZCash to a desktop wallet z address, and sending that to another new z address, and boom untraceable. Wrong or right?

I actually don't have a Coinbase account, so could take longer I'm guessing
@_date: 2018-02-07 00:10:46
I've checked there, but didn't want biased answers. Thus far I've gotten great answers from the BitCoin community!
@_date: 2019-01-09 22:26:50
I'll have to look into it thank you

I'm sure there is a sub-reddit specific towards cryptocurrency security, however I figured I'd get the best answer directly from those who have been around the longest. I realize a hardware wallet, aka Ledger etc, is one of the main preferred methods, but what about Wallets such as Androids Coinomi Wallet? Is it secure enough to hodl coins and perform transactions mid to long term? Thank you in advance!
@_date: 2018-03-14 22:06:51
Sorry guys, I'm sure you see posts like these all the time, and newcomers get downvoted due to inexperience. I'm just trying to hodl a wide variety of coins, BitCoin included. I just seem to always hodl onto the wrong coins.
@_date: 2019-01-09 22:28:17
It may be less or more in a year, but I need coins now..
@_date: 2018-02-07 02:53:39
Impressive! The amount I'm talking is around $10k, with room to grow.
@_date: 2018-03-14 22:13:06
Hmm very interesting information. For a second there I thought I was making bad choices picking all the wrong coins
@_date: 2018-02-07 04:39:46
My $10k, his $133k, or both lol?
@_date: 2018-11-20 07:02:58
I realize this sub dislikes alt-coin discussions... This is directed towards BitCoin specifically. BitCoin Cash has nothing to do with BitCoin. BitCoin is the leader, BitCoin Cash is a follower. As far I can tell, ABC is being labeled as the new BitCoin Cash, but what was wrong with the regular BitCoin Cash? Thus why I'm confused. The only way I could see the two connected is if for some reason Satoshi is being dubbed the reason BitCoin Cash exists... Aka the inventor of BitCoin is the same developer as BitCoin Cash.

I mean like BetaCoin +1,165%, YesCoin +828%, BridgeCoin +824%, etc.
