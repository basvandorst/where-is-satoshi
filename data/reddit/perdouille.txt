Saying "It's fake news" isn't a debunk

What can someone do to help the LN network without any bitcoin ?
@_date: 2017-12-30 11:26:57
I bought an IDE to USB drive to see what was on an old drive I used a long time ago, where I mined.
It was empty :(
@_date: 2018-05-10 14:06:59
Can we please talk about Bitcoin in ?
@_date: 2018-05-07 22:27:53
Monero is a shitcoin??

Reddit Is Fun is the best
@_date: 2018-05-10 17:27:42
I'm not against Bitcoin Cash, even if I don't own any. If they can prove their project works better than BTC that the way they will win. Let's focus on BTC adoption and future.
@_date: 2018-05-21 08:33:28
When BTC will fix its block size problem BCH will be useless, until then ...

Small question: Do you need to put btc in a channel to host a (useful) LN node ?
@_date: 2018-03-28 22:20:59
Which graphs ?
@_date: 2018-03-21 03:54:29
Autoconnect worked fine for me
@_date: 2018-03-17 23:55:53
Nice brigading lol
@_date: 2018-03-18 08:24:45
Ah :( That would've been great
@_date: 2018-03-18 01:01:53
I'm talking about posting the link of his comment on Why do you think he has so many upvotes when is normally AGAINST Bitcoin Cash and ? Why do you think is downvoted for saying that Bitcoin Cash isn't Bitcoin ? Because people coming from are voting, and that's brigading.
I don't hate I post on it sometimes.
@_date: 2018-03-21 00:27:55
It worked, thanks a lot !
@_date: 2018-03-22 06:18:36
How would you use it then? Can you split a satoshi?
@_date: 2018-03-24 18:10:46


I'm pretty sure there is open source equivalents that will do the job fine.
@_date: 2018-03-26 06:03:00
That's what we're trying to change
@_date: 2018-03-23 14:43:00
Do you think Segwit and batching would be enough to contain every transactions in case of a big rush ? We're already at 0.8MB according to [this](
@_date: 2018-03-18 01:15:54
Ok I understand, you're doing the right thing
(I wasn't going to use your screenshots to fight or Bitcoin Cash, just wanted to see your block from because I thought mods don't block people with a different opinion than them)
@_date: 2018-03-26 15:31:51
Not for me with Bitcoin-qt, the checkbox is checked by default
@_date: 2018-03-16 03:30:00
Well it doesn't seem to happen a lot, and LN should fix that :)
@_date: 2018-03-23 12:17:34
Maybe not cups of coffee, but what about $5 purchases online ? I don't own BCH, and I paid stuff with 1 sat / byte successfully with Bitcoin, but what if Bitcoin's hype strikes again and blocks become full like in december ?
@_date: 2018-03-18 01:07:29
Seriously ? Do you have screenshots ? (In private message if you want)
@_date: 2018-03-26 10:52:47
What if you disable RBF when you do the transaction ?
@_date: 2018-02-27 22:42:13
It explains the title. He's genuinely confused because he just woke up from a 1 month coma
@_date: 2018-03-05 22:10:26
But the receiver would need internet to check the funds on the wallet and he needs to trust you with the private keys.
@_date: 2018-02-14 19:02:22
It never left
@_date: 2018-03-15 19:36:37
Other coins aren't all shitcoins IMO, they have different features. Bitcoin Private is great for, well, privacy (Like Monero, ...).
@_date: 2018-03-16 03:37:31
Wow dude calm down, it's every 10 minutes in average. It sometimes more and sometimes less.
And if you pay with a credit card, it's not instant at all. That's why sometimes it gets back charged.
@_date: 2018-02-20 18:41:54
[Seems legit](
@_date: 2018-03-22 00:03:27
Handling a DDOS attack = Having more bandwidth than the attacker is using (and good servers capable of handling the load). That's why it's hard. There's some technologies than can help but there isn't a magic, free solution.
@_date: 2018-03-29 19:11:32
Why would it? (Honest question, I'm just curious about why it would be rejected)
@_date: 2018-03-21 00:19:17
I'm trying to get tBtc to try but every faucet I find is empty :(
@_date: 2018-03-18 06:17:20
You can go under 1 sat / byte ?? Does it work well ? 
@_date: 2018-03-01 19:43:02
High price, lot of users, forked from BTC so it's supposed to be secure, the team is active (I think), and low fees.
There's some competitive advantages.
@_date: 2018-03-15 17:47:04
It would be awesome if Twitch started using BtcPay instead of Bitpay, I like donating to streamers with BTC
@_date: 2018-11-03 17:06:55
Not a really good analogy. Even if the block isn't full, you don't waste resources with 32mb blocks like you would waste ressources making 1kg butter containers. The 32mb is the maximum size, it's not filled with random stuff to make the block 32mb in the end.
@_date: 2018-02-14 22:26:59
It wasn't a backdoor, it wasn't even a vulnerability in Notepad++. If I remember correctly, the NSA modified a DLL that Notepad++ used. They implemented a certificate check in the next versions
@_date: 2018-02-20 10:03:51
Or tell them before they find out by themselves
@_date: 2018-03-21 05:51:56
That's like saying Internet is worthless because servers can be DDOSed
@_date: 2018-03-26 15:27:40
No, you disable Replace By Fee so you can't emit another transaction later with a higher fee (Is that how it works ?)
@_date: 2018-02-13 11:20:34
I call it bItCoIn
@_date: 2018-02-11 18:27:49
What other versions ?
@_date: 2018-03-01 08:45:46
Oh it's this thread again
@_date: 2018-03-01 19:20:35
It has been used (and is used) because it works. I'm not a BCH fan (I don't even own any), and I hate the way BCH devs tried to name it "the true Bitcoin", but you can't deny BTC had a problem with fees. That's why BCH worked imo.
@_date: 2018-03-23 12:18:30
I don't know why you're getting downvoted, you're the best bot ever.
@_date: 2018-03-15 19:58:44
I don't know how you can do that, like import Monero features on Bitcoin. Isn't what a fork is for ? 
(And to the person who downvoted me: wtf ? why ?)
@_date: 2018-03-18 08:24:05


I'm currently paying 1cent per transaction, so I doubt Paypal is cheaper.
@_date: 2018-04-03 11:34:10
Can someone transcribe what he's saying please? English isn't my first language and I don't understand because of the low quality + his accent :/
@_date: 2018-04-25 02:03:53
Thanks mr bot
@_date: 2018-04-04 19:06:14
It's the format used by Android applications, you launch the .apk on your device to install the app
@_date: 2018-04-17 22:44:24
Why ?? It's trustless, I don't have to trust anybody to use Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-04-18 16:40:47
Because I don't think big blocks would fix anything in the long term. 
@_date: 2018-04-22 13:31:19
I tried LN but I cannot make Eclair work correctly. I can usually pay (donated to a community faucet) but cannot receive anything, even from the same node.
@_date: 2018-04-02 12:19:56
Is there an easy to use Lightning wallet? 
@_date: 2018-04-11 02:41:27
Yeah but if no one use it it's useless, here or not.
@_date: 2018-04-18 17:21:58
I just did and it worked, 0.3.1 fixed my issue, thanks and ! 
@_date: 2018-04-01 19:54:02
IT WAS HIM THE WHOLE TIME
@_date: 2018-04-18 15:51:11
The funding fee is 1sat / byte so it should be enough no ? It's enough to open AND close it
@_date: 2018-04-14 12:43:05
@_date: 2018-04-18 15:48:20
Yes, but why ? I'm putting 0.001 in a LN channel and I have 0.0013, it should be enough. 
@_date: 2018-04-19 13:32:01
He's saying you switched back to BTC because no one is using BCH so you had less players.
@_date: 2018-04-27 01:37:08
No one ever said ~~"Ethereum Classic is the real Ethereum"~~ or "Ethereum (ETC)" and "Ethereum Core (ETH)", that's why both coexist without issues.
@_date: 2018-04-18 16:04:43
Is this subreddit really censoring people ? Having open mod logs would be great imo.
@_date: 2018-04-25 00:30:08
I hate it :( I'm French, and my English is pretty good but I cannot understand people with an accent / speaking too fast :(
@_date: 2018-04-19 17:00:47
Yeah I agree, but I'm afraid people will put stuff that no one can delete (Illegal pictures, ...)
@_date: 2018-04-25 04:14:54
Source about the Pineapple fund?
@_date: 2018-04-18 16:41:35
I'm going to do this, thanks ! 
If I have 0 channel, Can I just install 0.3.1 and put my seed phrase in it ?
@_date: 2018-04-26 03:10:40
Will BTC lift the 21 million cap coin ?
@_date: 2018-04-27 17:09:15
I didn't know they did, I edited my post, sorry. 
But I don't see how it's the "real" ethereum.
@_date: 2018-04-19 16:35:18
I still don't understand the point of a social platform on the blockchain. I don't want anyone storing my messages or pictures for EVER, and I don't see why miners / nodes should pay to store it.
@_date: 2018-04-25 04:16:10
Internet is not the web, and the web is not the cloud.
@_date: 2018-04-02 23:40:47
Just like a lot of users are saying everyone in are either trolls or paid shills.
@_date: 2018-04-20 14:26:39
I think someone changed the wikipedia page, iirc Alexa search definitions on it.
Btw, (to the guy who did this), even if you hate Bitcoin Cash, if you edit the wikipedia page, you're a dick.
@_date: 2018-04-19 15:23:35
Has anyone calculated the max transactions per blocks with / without segwit ? I'm afraid a spam attack / massive usage would make fees explode like in december - january :/
@_date: 2018-04-18 17:03:57
Having 32mb blocks won't change anything now because the blocks aren't full. It may change in the future if BCH usage explode, but it won't change fees right now.
@_date: 2018-04-19 15:25:04
Calm down lol, he just made a precision.
@_date: 2018-04-22 14:05:59
I installed it on my phone and on my PC. I can send money with both but I cannot receive anything on PC.
For example, this website: 
I can pay and it works really well, but if I try to withdraw 100sat : 
I tried by connecting to another node, to make another channel, no chance.
And if I try to send money from my phone to my PC (I'm connected to two different nodes) : 
@_date: 2019-05-17 17:35:24
I suppose that since everything is stored locally, they cannot get your keys.
