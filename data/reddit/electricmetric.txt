2: Coinbase is already that company because they have merchant tools, which is basically BitPay's business. As far as I'm aware Circle doesn't provide that yet.
@_date: 2014-09-26 06:27:49
You can tell this comment was made without thinking because Circle does not even provide checkout pages yet.

"anymore"? You make it sound like this has been a chronic issue for you, but even according to your own post you've had a pretty amazing experience for them for a very long time.
You had a "loooong account history of very consistently doing things the right way every time ... every ... two .. weeks perfectly", and you "can't afford to be treated this way anymore"?
I get being annoyed, but just wait til Circle does the same. There have already been reports of it. Then you'll realize that fraud is not easy and you had a really good run that you didn't appreciate.

So they must be making money on the spread? i.e. pricing bitcoin higher than it is worth and keeping the difference, like a hidden fee.
@_date: 2014-08-03 06:53:53
Seems like this isn't necessarily true in lots of cases. For example, I could say, give me all your bitcoin or I will reveal your true name behind the username.  Well, me revealing your name is not a crime.  So it would seem that providing you the opportunity to have me not reveal your name, for a price, would also not be a crime.
Seems like blackmail itself is not actually a crime - only when the thing you threaten to do would itself be a crime.

Not really.  When that happens it is typically when the merchant completely folds and runs with the full pool.  Coinbase has a history of resolving these issues, so that argument doesn't make sense in this context.  Even if it did (and it doesn't), you are still not at the point where there is justification to expect that that will happen, since they seem to be responding to your inquiries.
You seem really eager to blast them.

This is absolutely insane.  In a good way.
A year ago, could you imagine the virtues of Bitcoin being defended for a full half-hour on C-SPAN?
This is the end before the beginning.  Buckle up, folks.

Pretty much everyone has had this idea since cloud wallet services started being developed 3 years ago.

They missed their deadline twice, when they claimed to launch but actually did not.

Just FYI that subreddit was not created by, and is not maintained by, coinbase.  A random user made it and it is usually filled with unanswered complaints that should really be redirected to their support system.

If your money is in "mystery limbo" why would you attempt to purchase more? Doesn't add up.

What company in their right mind would reverse the charge before you sent the bitcoin back?  Bank transfers are a reversible payment method.  BTC isn't, and it can be sent anywhere.  If they reversed their charge, you could just ship the BTC elsewhere and make off with  $16k worth of bitcoin like a thief.  Or you could hold it and reverse the bank charge and still make out with the $16k.  Since the other party is bearing all the risk here, the one with the irreversible method should be the one paying first.
@_date: 2014-10-06 03:48:49
If I were dropping 50k on something, $500 wouldn't really seem like a lot.

Seriously, rest of the world. Get your shit together and start getting your own countries to accept bitcoin. Bitcoin is global but regulation is not.

When they first went live in the US, the limits were only $100 per day per person. They've risen a great deal since then, so I can only imagine the same will happen for Europe.

["Launch" 1, March](
["Launch" 2, May](
Google is not that hard to use.
| Please note that opening up a database for collecting email leads is not a launch. At all.
You're preaching to the Choir.  Circle is the one who did not seem to understand this.  They promoted these announcements as launches, only for deceived users to realize otherwise on their own when all they could do was add their email to a list.
@_date: 2014-10-06 05:24:58
Uh, isn't it exactly the same if not worse for circle?
@_date: 2014-07-01 09:11:26
That's not a great explanation.  I think what you mean to say is that merchants immediately cashing out to USD will put downward pressure on the price because they are selling it instead of holding it, but you didn't explain that.  "Because of momentum" literally means nothing. :P
But I don't really buy it.  Sure, on the short term, for maybe like a few thousand dollars, but that's a drop in the bucket.  If people are spending, it's because they're acquiring it by buying it.  The price could only continue to fall specifically as a result of merchant spending if it was the same hardcore bitcoin users just continually releasing their coins into the market.  But that's not what's happening.  New users are buying and making up the difference.  And what's spent on merchants is just a fraction of any daily sell volume anyway.  So the affect you're talking about is slight if anything at all.

Coinbase specifically.  Requires your Coinbase API key.
**DO NOT GIVE YOUR COINBASE API KEY TO A 3RD PARTY SERVICE.**  You are just asking to be hacked.
Edit: The proper way for Mint to have done this would be OAuth, with just the "balance" permission.

Wow, congratulations, you're petulant and willing to make assumptions about how to run businesses you've obviously never operated.
@_date: 2014-07-06 02:54:23
Just FYI, every single bidder bid under market. If it's ever made public, you will be surprised at what he got it for. It was not above market value. Mark my words.
But I think if it ever is made public, it will probably be far enough from now that it won't make any difference.
@_date: 2014-07-25 07:22:13
Actually what's amazing is that they did not ban the account, even though they had every right to do so. The email is just a notification that they won't let the user buy/sell bitcoin for USD. As it states in the email, he can still transfer it out of his account.
If you ask me, that's incredibly gracious and possibly even risky for them considering the laws they must abide by.

Consultation is something you ask for, giving away knowledge for free is what people do for fun and karma.
@_date: 2014-02-02 05:40:00
Where did you get the bitcoin?
If they have reason to believe it is for/from illicit activity, like Shrem and BTCKing, or stolen, they could end up just like Shrem if they let you cash it out.
Not actually freezing your account and letting you tranfser that BTC elsewhere is actually extremely generous in that light.
Not saying that this actually applies to you.  It could be a mistaken assumption on their part.  But as long as they have that assumption, they are legally bound to act on it.

It sounds like your customer service experience is not done yet so why are you stopping to air it on r/bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-07-01 08:46:00
This guy's being downvoted, but he's actually correct, BitPay tends to have a higher spread than anyone else.  This is how they actually make money.  Their $30/$300/$3000 (max) per merchant is just kind of for show.
It's not like it's a conspiracy, it's just a business move.  It's a hidden cost of the user though, which is a little stinky.
@_date: 2014-07-24 20:50:27
Coinbase has had this for many months now.
@_date: 2014-08-03 18:33:37
Exactly, this just backs up my point. The "blackmail" is only a crime if revealing your identity is itself a crime.  The blackmail part doesn't really count for anything. So you are agreeing with me.
@_date: 2014-08-04 02:21:49
Exactly - "good reason". If you have reason to believe that someone will physically harm you if your identity is revealed, that's a good reason. If you simply fear embarrassment, that is not a good reason, and in that case it would not be a crime.
@_date: 2014-08-03 04:05:09
Is blackmail actually a crime?
@_date: 2014-08-04 02:33:01
No it doesn't. It's still the action that makes it a crime, not the "fear" that is induced. Intent to harm, regardless of whether it created "fear" is what is punishable. This is what is meant by "wrongful use." That is a qualifier that means that the "fear" only bears weight if the intent to harm would have been punishable anyway, had the person who is fearful not known about it.

Wow, this place is full of haters. What happened?
@_date: 2014-02-02 05:54:11
Well I'm glad to hear that you're legit.  Unfortunately I don't have the insight into your business that Coinbase does, to confirm.
Sounds like you had two wallets, and you were attempting to move bitcoin between them, and they blocked *that*.  You were probably able to transfer them out of Coinbase the whole time.  What was the 2nd wallet for?

I don't understand why y'all care about destroying BCH. The fork already happened, now it's its own coin. It's not even trying for the title of Bitcoin itself. Core won. You won. The war is over and now BCH is just doing its own thing. Let it be.

Robinhood will only let people bet, it will not let you actually by bitcoin to own and take off their site.
Which makes it mind blowing to me that everyone here is all about it. What ever happened to "DON'T KEEP YOUR COINS ON AN EXCHANGE!!"? It was like the number one rule...
