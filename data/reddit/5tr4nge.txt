It's a hardware wallet, and one of the most secure ways to store cryptocurrency 
@_date: 2017-12-04 11:21:10
Honestly, at that point I see litecoin, or even something like doge, being used for daily transactions, like groceries, and bitcoin used for bigger transactions, like houses, and cars.
Lower TX fees, and faster TXs are much more suited for daily transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:17:48
They're not dealing with a few hundred, or even a few thousand.
They're dealing with hundreds of thousands of dollars at a time. Amounts that are so big the fees are negligible 
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:05:04
Buy bitcoin through an exchange. 
Use an anonymous exchange (they exist) to turn it into monero.
Make a couple of transactions with monero.
Now slowly turn the monero back into bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:57:22
We pretty much already are.
There's only one or two posts now when we hit a new thousand milestone. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:15:58
I literally don't see what you're talking about.
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:23:15
Set it up with a segwit address, you'll pay almost no fees.
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:32:00
Probably Japan given how widely accepted it is there.

You could, but computers are easy to compromise, with the ledger none of your details are ever exposed to the computer.
You can't be attacked with a keylogger. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:58:41
Easier to talk in percentages.
In a year 5k could be the fluctuation in a day, and we don't even notice it.
@_date: 2017-12-13 07:58:44
This is news because? 
Whales are always toying with bitcoin prices.
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:02:26
..... 
You invested in something you didn't even understand. And now you're asking the internet for advice?
@_date: 2017-12-15 01:58:25
Mycelium, coinomi, those are two that I've use, or use. 
Your best best is to get a hardware wallet though, it's much more secure.
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:58:09
The second a competitor announces segwit support, coinbase will lose a decent chunk of their business, and immediately bring in support, but it'll be too little, too late.
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:27:08
... Did you really just post this?
You realise that's enough to find his private key and take all his bitcoin with right...
Edit: Okay, so it wasn't part of the private key. Good. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:39:48
Coinomi for amounts I don't mind losing, for day to day spending.
Ledger for holding large amounts, my bank account basically.

Coinbase really need to get their act together, this is pure stupidity as far as I'm concerned.

As someone who suffers from depression, and has frequent suicidal thoughts.
Bitcoin wasn't the cause of his suicide, it might have been a factor, but there would be other demons at play. 
Depression is horrible, and I'm sorry you lost him because of depression, but don't blame it on a currency. 
You could blame it on the societal system we have that places wealth on a pedestal, but not on bitcoin.
edit: Obligatory thanks for the gold. I didn't deserve it though, but thank you.

@_date: 2017-12-12 00:01:23
Just wait for LN, then it'll be a valid currency.
Also, if you're complaining about a $14 fee, try sending a large amount of money internationally. Not only will you get rekt by fees, and bank charges on both ends, but you'll also have to fill out all sorts of paperwork. 
Just because you can't see the bigger picture, doesn't mean it isn't working.

Not concern, but reaching my moon would cause that.

Greetings fellow shibe. 
Honestly, as fucked as this will sound, and I feel like I'm betraying bitcoin, but, doge is probably the best for use as an actually currency currently. Controlled inflation, low buy in price, very low TX fees, plus it's got the most welcoming community.
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:04:04
Also, it's Bitcoin, not bit coin, not bit coins. Bitcoin.
One word, and it's plural without adding an S to it.

@_date: 2017-12-10 15:53:19
yep, first thing I do when I wake up, check the price.

It's not a stock.
It's a decentralised, peer to peer currency. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:09:28
I apologise. I misunderstood.
If you're in the UK CeX accepts bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:35:07
Thank you, now we wait to see if that worked.

Glad I could help. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:36:33
I think it's just as bitcoin is becoming more popular, and people think everyone here must be an early adopter, with hundreds of BTC in their wallets. 
People like OP though, they're a special kind of cunt, they're earning a significant amount, and they still have the nerve to beg. 
I make less in a month than OP makes in a week, but you don't fucking see me begging do you. 
OP, fuck yourself, hard. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:20:42
My plan is to keep buying every pay day. 
We'll either see bitcoin drop like a rock, or reach new highs, very very soon.
Either of them is good for me, I'm not *that* concerned about the price, what bitcoin is interests me more than making money. Of course making money is a nice side effect, but it's not the be all and end all. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:15:46
Good luck timing the dip, or even knowing how much the dip will be.
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:30:30
How would I do that?
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:26:19
Different coins have very different purposes. 
It is possible it will render alt's useless, however there will still be a demand for them. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:23:18
Hmm, odd, that doesn't make sense.
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:01:52
Sure, it really won't be much, like only a few dollars worth. But gotta share the bitcoin love around.

Wait for the email, they're probably really busy due to how fast the price is going up.
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:02:25

@_date: 2017-12-13 21:08:45

@_date: 2017-12-07 10:14:25
This is only a few % now, remember that. 
10% ups and downs are normal for btc, don't look at it as a number, look at it as a percentage.

yeah... I call scam.
@_date: 2017-12-05 05:42:12
Not too late, but think carefully, you're still young, and bitcoin is highly volatile.
Do NOT get into thinking of it as a get rich quick scheme, you should first and foremost think of it as a currency that doesn't involve banks, and enables people to become more self sufficient. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:09:54
Plenty of videos online showing you how to use it.
But it's pretty intuitive.
And yeah, lock the seed words in a safe or something, preferably a fireproof one.
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:27:09
I've not set myself a goal based on price. 
I've set myself a goal to own a full coin. 
Obviously, if that never happens. I've still set myself a hard sell wall of $1m BTC before I even think of selling. It's very likely it will happen, it's just a case of when. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 02:47:39
As said, Coinbase has price alerts/alarms, that are pretty good.
@_date: 2017-12-05 09:41:17
When we no longer need to sell 
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:51:51
The effort to cash out, transferring to coinbase, selling it, cashing out my wallet. That is what forces me to save.
And as for why I was going to spend it on a game, am I not allowed to enjoy things?

Oh hey, someone else with the same goal as me. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:59:54
Welcome to bitcoin.
A lot of angry internet nerds in here (myself included) who expect you to be able to research for yourself. It also helps you not look like a fucking idiot when there is a post explaining your question on the front page,
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:40:05
Bitcoin (just like money) can be exchanged for goods or services.
Find a job you're good at, and have someone pay you btc to do it.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:26:07
Honestly at this point I'm expecting a flash dip, this level of growth is insane.
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:05:22
No no, it was my mistake, I assumed. I should have thought more carefully. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:54:33
Both are user friendly, but there is a possible way to access coins on a trezor by (from my understanding) shorting two of the contacts.
I love my ledger, and thankfully it's very discrete, it just looks like a USB stick.
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:13:27
Wrong thread my dude.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:35:07
nah, I've definitely got a few mBTC there, idk why they're not showing.
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:17:56
The USD, the GBP, and EUR, and all the other fiat currencies, always go up and down against each other (exchange rate) and as for why it's such a large amount, it could only a cent or two's difference, but when you multiply it by 15k it becomes a much bigger difference.
@_date: 2017-12-05 02:54:39
As I said, you could easily blame it on a societal system that places wealth on a pedestal.
I apologise if what I said came across as disrespectful, that was not my intention, however I realise my wording wasn't perfect. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 13:51:59
That's..wildly different to what I'm saying. 
I used a clickbait title to get people in. And I'm saying we stop asking, and start demanding, by taking our business ELSEWHERE.

@_date: 2017-12-07 16:43:59
I don't know, I was wondering that as well. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 07:42:32
I mean, I'm not aware of how much I've made, but that's because that isn't my focus, my focus is on how much btc I actually hold. 
(the answer is not enough, the answer will always be not enough)
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:53:46
Still, people now know that you know someone who potentially has 25 bitcoin.
That's a LOT of money, and people would physically harm someone to get hold of it. I'd be very careful with this. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:56:29
FUD FUD FUD 
@_date: 2017-12-13 06:15:16

@_date: 2017-12-08 14:52:15

And even if we did get in super early, and had several millions worth of btc, why would we cash out? It's only going to go up more.

Sometimes they don't send it for a while.
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:05:16

@_date: 2017-12-13 05:16:58
Coinbase better get their act together, they've become complacent.
Another exchange could easily steal their business model, and I see it happening soon if CB don't improve.

And we there.
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:08:24

I'd say it that way, but that's just me.

Coinbase is fine, you'll pay more in fees, and you'll get a lot of people telling you that you should use GDAX as you don't pay the fees, but that's down to you.
And safest wallet, is definitely a ledger, or trezor, however, for less than $500 or so, coinbase is fine to store your coins in.
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:49:54
As safe as you keep your phone.
@_date: 2017-12-05 02:01:57
About now. 
How many times do we have to say, never keep your bitcoin in an exchange. 
Literally as soon as your bitcoin exceeds the price of a HW wallet you should be ordering one.
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:49:42
A whale wouldn't be asking this question. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:19:37
I can understand why you say that. But honestly I don't earn enough. I'm just able to buy $30 or so every two weeks.
Bitcoin is a risk obviously, but I'm interested in what it represents. So I buy it over attempting to save. If I'm able to access money quickly I spend it. By putting it in bitcoin it forces me to save it. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:17:26

Have you given away the keywords or something?

HODL doesn't mean "never ever use or spend btc" hodl means, don't panic sell when it dips.
And as for a site to do that? Honestly, I don't know if there is one. 
I think you found a niche in the market OP.
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:16:43

I barely even raised my eyebrows at the drop.
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:21:11

We don't take kindly to it here.

It's unlikely you'll find someone willing to trade crypto for crypto.
It's even more unlikely you'll find someone willing to trade such a small amount. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:59:09
Nice creepypasta 
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:36:59
Monero will likely never hit coinbase. Everything being encrypted and hidden will leave too many governments wanting it gone.
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:13:47
This is!!!
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:01:49
Tell us here OP, you know you want to.
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:57:35
Yes it's crashing, this is the end.
Quick, send me all your bitcoin, I'll keep it safe during the crash. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 14:12:19
You have to select the exchange, but it works for most of them. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 02:51:53
It might not be intended as a joke, but it comes across as very crass, I understand what you're saying, but this isn't the place for it.
@_date: 2017-12-05 09:30:15
You can just buy another one.
And use the 24 words to recover it. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:04:00
Shapeshift charges more than that just to transfer it.

Coinbase is best for beginners, full stop.
Yes, there are some fees, sure. But, I, and many others are happy to pay those fees for the convenience, and ease of use.

Hell no.
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:09:48
Honestly, I can see that happening. HODLers, especially those of us who've been in it for more than a few months, will see the price go down, and get excited, Wall Street will see the price go down, and shit themselves. 
Especially if it's like a 50% drop. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:28:08
Okay, off topic. But what exactly does your username mean? 
I've tried putting it into hexadecimal translators, and only got incomplete stuff. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:24:45
Doge, and probably because the community is the least toxic of any crypto.

That was the bubble pop yeah. 
Next stop 25k
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:16:01
I'm aware of that, I just thought that they should be aware what they did probably wasn't the smartest thing to do with that money. 
At least not before researching btc.
@_date: 2017-12-06 05:47:11
It happened, corrected, and went back up.
All in under a day. 
If you were waiting for the crash you missed out.
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:12:14
That's not a real bitcoin, that's a fucking scam. 
OP, no offence, but if you think that's a bitcoin, you're an idiot.

@_date: 2017-12-04 10:53:22
It did indeed, thank you .
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:35:49
This was funny... the first hundred times it got posted here.
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:21:17
Yeah, you're still at a level I can only dream of, don't feel so small.
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:44:57
Because people believe in bitcoin as a currency?
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:37:38
They're still clearing a huge backlog. 
Give them time.
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:59:46
Hacking an exchange is easy. 
And if you hack an exchange the blockchain means nothing. 
The blockchain just means you can't magic more coins into existence.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:33:46
STOP WAITING FOR THE DIP
The next dip could still be higher than the current ATH.
@_date: 2017-12-05 02:33:02
Don't invest everything you have,
Invest only what you can afford to lose.
And it is definitely NOT too late to invest. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:12:36
Sounds like an incredibly stupid idea.
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:55:48
tbh it kind of sounds to me like OP is begging without begging.
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:05:30
At this rate... Definitely.
@_date: 2017-12-05 02:29:47
.... Are you stupid?
Bitcoin is highly traceable. Thanks to the blockchain, however, it is sort of anonymous, as wallets don't store any information about who owns them. 
And as for the coinbase thing... If you believe that, just no.
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:06:42
Yeah, you were right so far. I'll give you that. gg
@_date: 2017-12-05 04:16:05
Paypal is too easy to reverse, no one is going to trade bitcoin for paypal, unless they know you, and trust you.
@_date: 2017-12-05 05:21:59
Buy more, get a ledger nano s, know how to use it. 
Enjoy bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-13 06:55:29
It's gone, forever. 
That's why it's important to not be an idiot with your bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:03:55
This is what I do.
Every pay day I buy £25 
It's not much, but it's all I can afford currently, and I know it'll pay off long term.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:12:19
Has coinbase sent you an email to say they've sent it yet?
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:29:19

30 seconds checking your post history reveals you go to, or went to, UCF, a bit more digging would reveal more personal information.
Don't go posting stuff like this on your main account, it only opens you to potential attacks.

Oh wow, it's this... again...

@_date: 2017-12-08 23:59:23
Yeah, I'm calling bullshit on this.
@_date: 2017-12-04 11:08:24
Okay, let's try and make this really simple.
SegWit, allows for faster, and cheaper transactions, SegWit allows more transactions per block. 
As services like coinbase make up the majority of transactions, it should be in their interest to push for SegWit. But they're not. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:37:03
Lol. No worries.
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:57:34
Looks like you're wrong already.

Honestly, if they're encountering high traffic (coinbase themselves, not just the mempool) sometimes it can take them a few hours to send it.
I had to wait around 12 hours just before the Bcash fork.

I'd love to know how you came to that conclusion.

Nope, you're screwed, unless you get lucky (like 1 in a billion lucky) and the receiver returns them somehow.
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:33:58
Like I said, I'm willing to pay them for convenience. 
It's really not that much if you're careful about it.
@_date: 2017-12-05 02:48:32
Of course there will be a dip, but how much, and when, is anyone's guess. 
If I was a betting man though, I'd say shortly after 15k.

We need to spread awareness of his attempted scam though.
Because like it or not, it's a scam, he is trying to scam new crypto investors out of money. 
If he was targeting experienced crypto investors, then yeah, I'd agree, just shut up and ignore him, but targeting new investors, inexperienced investors, that's fucked and we need to spread awareness. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 04:17:49
If it works for you, and will help you financially, then sell some of them.
Even selling 10% of them would help you a lot, and leave you with a lot left for future gains.

This is what I was trying to say with my comment 
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:55:17
You shouldn't be investing if a little dip scares you.
And don't use anxiety as an excuse, I practically have a panic attack every time I leave the house, but you don't see me shitting myself and selling the second bitcoin dips slightly.

@_date: 2017-12-05 03:16:09
At that price, you could just leave it on coinbase.
However, if you invest more, get a ledger nano s, learn how to use it, and enjoy keeping your crypto as secure as possible.
@_date: 2017-12-05 14:14:28

There is other crypto MUCH better suited to that.

If you're purchasing it as a get rich quick scheme... Don't waste your money.
However, if you're purchasing it because you're interested in the technology behind it, and you see it as a currency, then go ahead and purchase it.

Depends how much it is really. (Do NOT tell us how much you got, I'm just saying)
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:15:57
I wouldn't buy today personally.
I'd wait until 25k, this increase has been a bit too rapid, things could get very messy soon.

Still centralised though.
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:11:48
Bitcoin was primarily designed as a currency, that is what I, and many others use it for.
@_date: 2017-12-05 05:46:54
Have they emailed you to say they've sent it?
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:29:55
You're in bitcoin for the wrong reason. 
Yesterday (and I think still today) we had posts explaining exactly WHY this is the wrong way of thinking. 
I'm not going to say I hope you don't make money, I hope you lose money.

They just move it quickly into an exchange, change it to monero, and make a couple of transactions, and it's gone, they can't be chased anymore.

It's a currency. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 04:19:06
Sell 10 of the coins. 
It'll be a huge bonus for you. 
And it'll still leave you with a load of them for when it really takes off. 
edit to add: I wish I had even close to that many coins, I'm still trying to get to 0.1 coins.

Ahh, I can understand that. 
I didn't say I'd completely stopped drinking, only that I'd cut back. I now drink once, or twice a month. 
And the suicidal thoughts are still there, they're just a lot quieter, it's more like someone across the room whispering them, instead of someone screaming them in my ear. If that makes any sense.
@_date: 2017-12-15 13:42:31
What part of it is reverse psychology? 
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:48:54
People use bitcoin every day.
HODL doesn't mean never use it or sell it. It just means don't get rid of all your holdings. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 08:19:05
I will repeat, you are in Bitcoin for the wrong reason. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:31:32
Okay, that still doesn't mean they can see the transactions, the transactions are encrypted, literally no one can see them.
@_date: 2017-12-15 14:02:20
Definitely makes me feel a lot better, I've not even had my coffee yet, so I was even more confused than usual.

From my understanding, he paid another btc user, who bought the pizzas for him.
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:08:35
Hey now. I'm buying bitcoin because I see it as the future.
As I've said in other posts. I'm interested in what it represents, that's why I'm buying. Making a profit (currently) is just a side effect 
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:05:02
Give it time.
They don't know what they're up against.
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:53:23
The next dip, could be more than the current ATH. 
It's up to you, but, if you're in it for the long run, buying now isn't a terrible idea. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:54:11
Drunk typo of HOLD on an old bitcoin forum.
Literally that simple.
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:53:26
Bad idea, you should learn about bitcoin before you buy in.
Learn how it works, learn how to keep it secure, learn WHY it's important.
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:04:39
Do you have the seed words? 
Should be 12-24 words.

Oh no, it was the most brutal thing I've ever seen, but very little screaming surprisingly.

If that makes sense.

Yeah. There are, but it doesn't mean you can ask how much money they have. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 09:40:27

Meh, wake me up at 15k
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:41:40
It all changed at 10k.
That's when people started coming in and asking stupid questions. 
Now, I confess, I'm one of the people who doesn't even own a full coin (in fact I own shamefully little), but I'm also not under the impression that that tiny amount alone will make me rich.

What about you OP? What's your bank balance huh? How much do you earn in a year? 
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:48:20
What have I ruined? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:14:31
Suddenly I don't feel so bad with my [not enough] mBTC
@_date: 2017-12-05 05:24:07
Revealing your real identity, when talking about THAT level of money... Real clever idea.
@_date: 2017-12-05 05:48:53
There's your answer. 
Wait on that email first. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:04:12
6, 12, 14, 29, 32, 46.
Those numbers immediately jumped into my head, if you win you owe me half.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:18:50
Honestly, at this point I genuinely don't know. 
I hope it is, but this could be a sign of things to come.
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:05:04
Similar to doge then.
@_date: 2017-12-12 06:02:20
British. 
There's just nothing to be gained by being a cunt on the internet. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:18:29
You don't understand crypto currency at all do you?
There's no organisation behind it that sees all the transactions. The transactions are encrypted, NO ONE can see them.
@_date: 2017-12-05 02:37:30
You know what, you're right, it was a douchey response. 
However, it seemed like someone trying to spread FUD, but failing. 
So I apologise to OP.
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:05:24
Hey man, umm, can I be a complete cunt and ask you to delete, or edit down this comment? 
Every time I scroll past it my internet has a stroke and nearly dies.
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:15:15
To the grave? Sure. I'm already planning on my will containing 24 random words. So... 
@_date: 2017-12-05 02:18:29
So I wasn't far off then, nice.
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:19:42
Nothing wrong with investing in ETH, as long as you know what you're doing.
Diversifying your portfolio is generally a good thing. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:57:53
I'd say we're still in the very early adopter phase.
The next year or so we'll enter early adopter.
@_date: 2017-08-06 16:16:25
And I absolutely plan to spend my Coins, as soon as they're accepted as widely as fiat currency. At which point, they'll be worth so much more than they are now.
@_date: 2017-08-05 17:10:54
I'm going to say the complete opposite and say that crypto will be the global currency by 2025, with fiat money almost totally unused. 
@_date: 2017-08-08 03:05:23
Generally as soon as you make a post in here they'll come scrambling to support you.
Don't want any negative press.
@_date: 2017-08-05 15:04:22
Get ready to buy even more.
@_date: 2017-08-14 03:26:07
IF the US and NK go to war, bitcoin will either go to the moon, or sink to near 0 value. 
War causes massive financial instability, the bigger the war, the more instability it causes.
@_date: 2017-08-06 20:39:25
I'm going to get flamed for this I know. But still.
Download the coinbase app, complete the profile verification, AND THEN BUY THEM THROUGH THAT!! Then move them out of coinbase, and into a wallet where you control the private keys.

BCH is an altcoin, and one with a cult mentality behind it.
@_date: 2017-08-14 03:51:46
Yeah, I get what you're saying, that's why I suggested a nice one, nice ones tend to have a lot of cctv.
@_date: 2017-08-12 16:54:32
My bad, I read that too fast and somehow missed that part.
@_date: 2017-08-06 04:59:03
Or realise that there is less than 24 hours between all three, and be happy that Bitcoin is increasing in price so much. 
It was almost constant All Time Highs for a few hours, we should be celebrating.
@_date: 2017-08-06 18:36:34
But the point is, with the price BOOMing so hard, one coin will probably be enough to buy a house with. Which is exactly why it's the time to spend.
@_date: 2017-08-04 11:41:30
I got into it when Trump starting to look like he'd actually win the election. I realised he'd cause financial uncertainty, and cause the price of BTC to rise.
Looks like I was right so far.

Rollercoaster? We're on a rocket baby.
@_date: 2017-08-06 16:05:03
If this happens, Litcoin and/or Dogecoin will be used for daily purchases, Bitcoin and/pr Ethereum will be used for big stuff, like cars, or houses. 
This is why you HODL no matter what, when (not if) Crypto becomes the main form of money used internationally, then we never have to work another day in our lives.
@_date: 2017-08-05 05:18:49
And there go my dreams of living on mars some day.

Nope, one or the other, with nothing in between.
@_date: 2017-08-09 00:32:04
Maybe don't link stuff that's illegal in most places to somewhere where people are trying to distance bitcoin from that sort of stuff. 
Just an idea.
@_date: 2017-08-05 04:50:08
I don't, they sold the most proven crypto, for an unknown, and now they're getting what they deserve.
I'd have more sympathy for someone selling btc and buying doge. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 17:16:37
I'm kinda with you on this.
It's super easy to convert the pricing.
@_date: 2017-08-15 13:58:34
You're on the internet... complaining about memes... let that sink in.
@_date: 2017-08-05 16:53:47
Your choice.
There might not be a drop coming.
Buy a little and see how you feel, or wait, but you could regret waiting.

Thank you for posting this, they just took it down.
@_date: 2017-08-05 05:27:53
I'm going to say it won't drop below $3000 again. This is the new normal.
@_date: 2017-08-22 15:24:52
I'm buying in a few hours, as soon as the money enters my bank. 
I have full faith that we will be seeing $10k by the end of the year. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 17:09:19
Could be a great time to buy, could be an awful time to buy.
@_date: 2017-08-05 04:15:56

If it sounds too good to be true. It probably is.

$3,190 ATH now. 
What is happening???
@_date: 2017-08-05 21:51:09
So, it's spam?
@_date: 2017-08-05 04:37:29
Am I seeing this right $3,240???
@_date: 2017-08-09 23:50:10
Never, we're not going to bother with the moon again.
Mars, maybe I can see that happening.
@_date: 2017-08-04 11:35:48
"In his view, cryptocurrency left the “dark ages” six months ago, when it was still the domain of “a lot of people who believed in anarchy.” He thinks that cryptocurrency is a good five years from going mainstream and that the bubble will burst some time after that, at which point he will sell his assets."
He's mad, when Crypto goes mainstream, that's when it's going to the moon. BTC will almost immediately reach the point where if you don't already have a full coin, you're never going to afford one.
(and yes, you can borrow my crystal ball)
@_date: 2017-08-05 03:37:53
Going back up though

I don't know, my friend bought a LOT in 2009. Every time he needs money, he sells enough to buy what he wants or needs, and then holds the rest. 
Realistically he never needs to work a day in his life. Yet for some reason, he still does, he carries on working in his dead end, minimum wage job.
@_date: 2017-08-05 05:21:34
I think it will happen within our lifetime, it just won't be very well established.

That's NOTHING in crypto, it could go up $300 in the next few seconds. 
@_date: 2017-08-06 05:00:30
Isn't that why everyone wants it to go down in value? Even if it only goes down in value a little bit.
@_date: 2017-08-08 03:07:44
PM me your address, I'll send you $5 of Bitcoin free. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 06:07:21
I mean, if people want to panic sell, due to a tiny dip in the price, I'm not going to complain, more cheap coins for me.
@_date: 2017-08-14 10:23:32
bittylicious is an okay place, I've bought from there before with no issues.
@_date: 2017-08-05 04:03:10
Yes, this time tomorrow, you'll be able to buy 100 Bitcoin with a dollar.
@_date: 2017-08-11 07:28:13
You really think a meme will bring the prices down? 
@_date: 2017-08-04 18:26:06
Want to send small amounts of money, but feel like you're sending more? Use Dogecoin.
@_date: 2017-08-12 16:59:05
mBTC is better for day to day use, sure. 
But for large scale trading (the stuff that increases the value of bitcoin) then BTC is a better unit as you can trade a "lower volume" for more money.
@_date: 2017-08-06 03:40:26
In all honesty, in three years Bitcoin will probably hit 100k USD, put half the money you have into it. And hopefully you'll end up reaping the rewards.
@_date: 2017-08-05 03:47:43
$5k, calling it now.
$5 on it. 
@_date: 2017-08-08 03:23:58
New ATH on Bitstamp. $3,439
@_date: 2017-08-31 13:37:14
It could increase by 1,000% in a day, it could go down by 90% in a day. It could not increase all day, it could not increase for years, it could slowly decrease for years.
Stop asking for statistics and promises about a hugely unpredictable currency. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 17:05:44
I'm going to say either $0.001 or $100k 
@_date: 2017-08-08 12:56:55
... Yep

@_date: 2017-08-09 18:03:08
Who are you in debt to? 
@_date: 2017-08-08 05:44:44
Because of the stereotype of early Bitcoin adopters.
@_date: 2017-08-14 04:10:18
This will explain it better than I can.
@_date: 2017-08-04 18:29:44
No, Trump was elected because "TRIGGER ALL THE LIBRULS HURRDURRDURR".
Like it or not, Trump was elected because of memes, for memes, and now the entire world is laughing at America.
@_date: 2017-08-05 03:29:52
Get out of here with that negative mindset.
@_date: 2017-08-06 21:52:17
Yeah, that's kind of everyone's thoughts, Bitcoin will soon be worth so much we either never have to work a day in our lives by selling it. Or it will be worth nothing.
There is no in between, we're either going to the moon, or pulling a challenger.
@_date: 2017-08-05 16:37:50
if bitcoin is too expensive to buy a whole coin at once. You know what you do?
You buy little bits at once.
If you want a crypto that is kept at a deliberately low price, by creating more coins. Look into doge, that's what you want. Hell you can buy THOUSANDS of doge for a few dollars.
@_date: 2017-08-13 01:46:23
@_date: 2017-08-06 02:57:38
Never too late. I plan on holding on to it, until it is accepted as widely as cash. 
@_date: 2017-08-04 12:19:20
Oh man, thank you for making me realise this. I'm dying of laughter now.
The kid is living at home with his mom, and is complaining about "liberal freeloaders". I haven't felt this good in ages.
@_date: 2017-08-13 01:46:53
This is!

By the end of the year, calling it now.
@_date: 2017-08-14 03:42:16
I'd suggest meeting in a nice pub or bar, that way you can both have a drink while you wait for it to confirm.
@_date: 2017-08-05 03:48:51

@_date: 2017-08-05 17:06:46
This bubble isn't a bubble, it's a sign of the future.
@_date: 2017-08-14 03:45:37
This isn't meant to dismiss you at all, and I'm not suggesting you're doing this.
But, I'd recommend everyone be VERY careful of downloading any app other than highly recommended wallets, it'd be far too easy to hide some malware in there. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 17:56:44
This meme literally gave me cancer.
@_date: 2017-08-07 15:31:36
Are you mad? Once it becomes the realm of normies, you won't have to sell.
@_date: 2017-08-14 05:51:23
Why bother accepting a currency if you're not going to train your staff in what it is?
@_date: 2017-08-10 01:27:35
So, you mean, the Bitcoin community will be the Bitcoin community...
@_date: 2017-08-06 08:21:31
we'll drop to $2900 this week, then start the journey to the moon.
@_date: 2017-08-16 13:04:18
Christ, I'd LOVE for the price to drop 80%... I know it would recover, but it would allow me to buy even more, for cheap.
@_date: 2017-08-14 03:50:34
Doesn't sound like you've been scammed per se, just paying more than you need to.
@_date: 2017-08-14 03:59:29
Have you seen the size of some of the bitcoin farms? 
You have people running hundreds of thousands of machines, all mining at once. Even if the math problems get harder, they'll still be solved fast. 
Plus, with segwit, it'll speed the transactions up a lot.
@_date: 2017-08-14 10:26:31
Do NOT buy into it expecting short term returns, buy into it as a 10 year plan.
@_date: 2017-08-05 03:13:08
Houston, we have $3000.
@_date: 2017-08-05 03:43:37

What's with the sudden increase in people looking to buy using paypal?
@_date: 2017-08-07 02:31:16
No doge? I am disappointed. 
@_date: 2017-08-06 04:57:04
So, judging by this, we have another small fall in value coming, then it's going to increase significantly again. It's almost like bitcoin is following an exact pattern.
@_date: 2017-08-12 16:59:58
I think a large part of it is due the the Korean crisis, war is bad for the economy, but good for bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-12 18:17:02
Hey, neither did I.
I just noticed the price and came here to post.
Sorry I offended you so much.
@_date: 2017-08-06 20:41:25
Unbelievably retarded idea. 
@_date: 2017-08-06 16:18:18
And Bitcoin is currently at the "internet in the 90s" stage.
We have maybe 10 years before Bitcoin is widely accepted, and then... And only then, do we think about spending.

That is the single ugliest car I have ever seen. I love it and I need one.
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:52:14
Well, I was only pointing it out. 
Remember, we have a lot of new members at the moment, they might not be aware.
@_date: 2017-11-28 11:34:58
I had the exact same date in my mind as well.
We could be on to something here. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:56:36
You calling me a newbie?
@_date: 2017-11-25 09:45:34
I love my ledger, but ultimately they do much the same thing, so it's all personal preference.
@_date: 2017-11-15 07:58:36
I had coinbase somehow make an $11 transaction turn into $0.84 
Who should I contact about this?
@_date: 2017-11-25 19:01:56
I didn't say they'd succeed, I said they'd be trying to. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:14:04
You're a special kind of stupid aren't you...
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:15:10
I can't buy because I bought as much as I could 16 hours ago, and now I have no money left to put in.
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:37:21
My goal is 1btc. But I've set that for a year or so.
My real aim is to have 0.1 btc before I break my new years resolutions.
@_date: 2017-11-15 08:03:05
Yeah, but, what I'm saying is, when I look at the transaction on coinbase, it was $11 sent, and $13 including transaction fees. 
However, as soon as it appeared in my ledger, only 84 cents showed up. 
That's what I mean by they ripped me off. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 11:41:12
The best time to invest in bitcoin was in 2010, the next best time is now.
Invest, keep it very, very safe. And wait a few years, and you'll have a down payment on a house. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 06:48:21
Honestly, for use as an actual currency, dogecoin definitely has merits. 
If it didn't have a meme name, then I could see it being a LOT more popular. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 00:54:25
I'd put my life savings into dogecoin before I used Bcash
@_date: 2017-11-23 07:17:42
Banks were centralised though.
@_date: 2017-11-25 09:51:15
So, the very people who bitcoin is supposed to keep out, are now getting in. 
This is going to go just great.
Before long they'll be lobbying to regulate it.
@_date: 2017-11-15 08:09:19
Can't get it on coinbase, because clearly they don't like you seeing anything. But this is it from the ledger.
@_date: 2017-11-22 20:16:29
Unless it goes boom in the atmosphere, then bitcoin is kinda fucked.  
@_date: 2017-11-15 08:24:56
So people who don't have large amounts of money spare? What? Are they supposed to just not invest in crypto? or leave it all on exchanges?
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:59:42




Bcash shill confirmed.
@_date: 2017-11-22 20:13:45
+1 for coinbase
They don't even let you choose the fees, and always seem to pick the highest possible fees, then add more on top. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 00:50:27
I HOPE bitcoin drops by "about 20%", there's nothing like a flash sale.
@_date: 2017-11-15 13:03:00
Money out. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:10:37
People panic selling, and people panic buying.
@_date: 2017-11-28 11:36:48
We'll see a small dip. As people sell off for lambos. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 19:36:14
Anything less than 10% isn't even a blip. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 10:15:27
I hung out in here before even buying any coin, you seem to think that I wasn't aware of the subreddit before I'd started buying... 
@_date: 2017-11-23 14:49:23
That was kind of my point.
@_date: 2017-11-22 20:20:06
Bitcoin is too big to crash, there are bigger powers than you or I can imagine controlling the price of bitcoin. 
The whales won't let it crash, they have too much power.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:59:12
lol, I was gonna say. 
It is funny to watch though. I haven't laughed this hard in a long time. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 08:04:33
When I look at the transaction on coinbase, it was $11 sent, and $13 including transaction fees.
However, as soon as it appeared in my ledger, only 84 cents showed up.
That's what I mean by they ripped me off.
Being charged for purchases I don't mind, I'll pay the fee for convenience, but having money literally disappear.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:12:30
Pretty much yeah. 
But, flash sale and all that.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:53:36
Can you let us all know next time you're going to buy? 
We'd like advance notice of the flash sale.
@_date: 2017-11-23 07:18:56
I'm only aiming for a JDM imported DC5 type R.
It might not be everyone's dream car, but it's mine. And they seem to be appreciating in value at the moment.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:43:16
It's just whales dumping and pumping.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:59:39
You the real MVP
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:54:05
We need to switch to mBTC at this point, it makes it a lot less intimidating 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:32:36
Dead link.

I'm holding, and buying until I have enough to buy my dream car, and still have some left over.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:23:48
I wasn't, but then I hung out in here enough that I knew it would go back up.
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:01:56
Honestly. It was a rush. 
I'm a sick fuck who gets hard when the price dips fast, makes me horny.
@_date: 2017-11-15 08:16:09
So, basically coinbase lied to me about the transaction fee. Fair enough then. 
I guess I can't be mad. Oh well. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:04:01
Hell, I'd do it for 10btc, I mean, I'm getting snipped soon anyway. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 11:34:04




K then.
@_date: 2017-09-02 16:33:54
The way bitcoin is going, in the future, it won't matter if you bought at $4500, or $5500. Bitcoin is going to be worth $150k+ in a matter of years.
@_date: 2017-09-28 00:04:30
I kind of have to agree.
I only got on the bitcoin train at $2700, and even if it drops to below $1, I'll keep buying bitcoin, I'll keep using bitcoin. I mean, sure, it's nice to see your "money" going up, but I'm interested in bitcoin because of the possibilities it presents for the future. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 18:39:55
I honestly believe it's possible for 1 satoshi to equal 1 dollar in the not too distant future.
Honestly, I say 10 years and that's what we'll be seeing.
@_date: 2017-09-14 13:51:37
Same, that's why I'm hoping it's still down when I get paid again.
@_date: 2017-09-03 01:41:11
Bitcoin AND Ethereum are both the future of money, they're both going to increase in value by more than you or I can imagine currently.
@_date: 2017-09-01 21:28:10
It's not about having it to store wealth. 
For some (not all owners) it's not even a status symbol. It's about owning something you love, that you enjoy.
I accept that it's not to everyone's tastes, but, for me, if I ever have the money, I'm buying myself a really nice car. 
@_date: 2017-09-03 15:31:34
New investors are crying about the dip, HODLers aren't even bothered, and are only buying more.
@_date: 2017-09-04 17:49:21
I'm buying bitcoin for seriously long term gains, it dropping to sub $1k over the course of a year doesn't bother me, I know it will only go up again. And this only gives me a chance to buy more coins.
I'm not bothered if my ~$200 drops to ~$20 because I have full belief it will go back up, and I can just buy more.
Don't worry about the dollar value, worry about the bitcoin amount you hodl.

Look at the username, OP is 100% a troll.
@_date: 2017-09-09 20:11:01
Dude. It's called a JOKE.

Keyword being CURRENTLY.

Hey, so, can I borrow your crystal ball? I need to know tonight's lottery numbers.
@_date: 2017-09-22 14:27:56
Don't forget, you'll also have whales taking advantage of the fact it's going down. And driving it down further so they can increase their holdings. 
I believe $1500 is entirely possible, and you bet I'd be buying the whole way down.
@_date: 2017-09-01 20:22:04
You know it's possible to just add more decimals to bitcoin right...

@_date: 2017-10-13 14:54:50
Don't wait for the price to dip.
In a few years you'll be looking back on 5k as if it was nothing.
@_date: 2017-09-15 11:34:04




K then.
@_date: 2017-10-18 20:21:04
I mean, sure, the video shows it, but that public key isn't quite straight with the paper, and the paper looks too white, if that makes sense.
@_date: 2017-10-17 13:20:26
That's my only concern, I want to be able to own at least one full coin before it becomes financially impossible for 99.99% of the human population.
@_date: 2017-09-02 15:04:30
If you're really going to HODL long term, it makes no difference if you buy now, or at 5k, as bitcoin is going to be worth a LOT more soon.
@_date: 2017-10-18 20:13:35
Is it just me that thinks the sign looks suspiciously photo-shopped? 
@_date: 2017-09-02 01:56:08
Depends, are we talking about an NSX? Or a crappy generic Honda?
@_date: 2017-09-03 16:36:27
This is cypto, huge dips are totally normal, I wouldn't even panic at a 90% dip.
@_date: 2017-09-22 14:10:20
Correction, we'd be buying at that price. 
Most of the noobs will panic and sell, driving the price even lower.
@_date: 2017-09-09 20:11:24
Are you unable to detect sarcasm? Or are you just stupid?
@_date: 2017-09-01 20:07:25
Cars aren't "just for transport" 
Admittedly most of the soulless econo-boxes are just for transport, but some cars, are works of art, they're engineering masterpieces, they're fun to drive. 
Obviously anyone buying a brand new lambo is a fool, but, if someone has the money to buy one, and they love driving it, then fair play. 
I mean, fuck, if my bitcoin is ever enough to buy a McLaren, you can bet I'll be straight to the dealership buying a lightly used one. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 00:41:30
So you mean if it dips 50% then we can buy even more cheap coins. 
Sounds like a win to me.
@_date: 2017-10-16 06:12:09
Don't mine to make money, mine to support the blockchain.
@_date: 2017-10-25 01:27:04
Diversifying your portfolio is never a bad idea, we don't know which cryptos will make it long term, so hodling more than one is never a bad idea.
@_date: 2017-07-24 13:03:51
Sell BCC and buy BTC. Drive the price of BCC to zero.
@_date: 2017-07-27 13:53:36
My thought too, going to knock it off the shelf, causing it to crash to the lowest it's been in years.
@_date: 2017-07-25 13:36:52
This can mean only one thing... Someone kidnap Justin Beiber, we all buy during the inevitable crash, then enjoy the massive profits when he gets returned to the public eye.
@_date: 2017-07-25 21:52:12
Shit, if I could go back to my teen years, back when a pizza was 10K btc, I'd put every penny I earned into bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-07-31 18:08:33
I managed to get some BTC out of coinbase within a few minutes an hour ago.
The huge delays seem to have stopped.
@_date: 2017-07-28 13:22:57
Coinbase is shitting the bed at the moment due to so many people moving coins out of it.
It's likely they don't even have enough coins, so are scrambling to buy more, that's likely a part of the reason BTC is going up in value again, despite the uncertainty caused by the fork.
@_date: 2017-07-25 22:21:11
Lighten up. A joke won't kill you.
@_date: 2017-07-29 18:49:45
I was waiting for nearly 2 hours last week.
I honestly feel sorry for everyone who's waiting now.
@_date: 2017-07-25 00:58:50
I can't be the only one secretly hoping it temporarily drops to near zero, just for a few hours. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 17:44:35
Exactly, I'm predicting shortly after the fork BTC will drop to the lowest it's been in months. 
Hopefully though transactions won't be as slow, due to people being smart enough to realise WHY controlling your private keys is a good thing. (disclaimer, I say this as someone who uses Coinbase purely for my "spending" coins, I hold my HODLing coins in my own wallet.)
But it's definitely going to be an interesting time to watch the prices of all crypto.
@_date: 2017-07-22 22:38:37
Makes me wonder if this counts as begging.
@_date: 2017-07-29 02:28:19
Asking out of genuine curiosity.
Is Mycelium any good? Or is it only electrum?
@_date: 2017-07-23 18:36:51
This is why dogecoin is so successful, because it is intentionally kept at a lower value, people are willing to use it as a currency, and not just horde it. 
For bitcoin to be really successful, more people need to be willing to use it as an actual currency, that will drive the price way up.
@_date: 2017-07-25 13:39:46
Take it out of coinbase, into a wallet where you control the private key, and then settle in for the fork.
@_date: 2017-07-21 16:44:58
Read the guidelines.
@_date: 2017-07-29 14:54:20
As I said the other day.
"Coinbase is shitting the bed at the moment due to so many people moving coins out of it.
