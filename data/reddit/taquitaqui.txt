How many people does it take to lose some bitcoin?

Would it keep increasing as well due to reverse inflation. Meaning more people using it, more product being bought so therefore more value in each sat? Maybe this belongs in shower thoughts.

Who cares if they accept btc? That’s what bch is for. 
BTC is the people’s gold. 
BCH is the people’s cash.

Sit with them to open a Coinbase account. Buy and then put it in their CB Vault. Not their keys but hopefully close enough to their bitcoin with less “responsibility”. Don’t do it yourself. Too much tax liability, loss potential, etc. Good luck!

Multishard wallet. Private key split in 3 but you only need 2 to access your funds and restore your wallet on a device. Give 2 of these to 2 people you love and trust with your life. Keep one yourself or give it to a 3rd person. If they ever team up and decide to screw you, you’re dunzo! The odds of everyone dying at the same time is very small. This I believe is one of the best options. You could also write a will that states X people have your private key ( write your address or so ) and state that you would like it haha o be distributed so and so way.
