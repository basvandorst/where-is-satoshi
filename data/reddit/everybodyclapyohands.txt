I am the developer of MyWl.lt as well as the Digitalcoin Community Administrator. I've been a professional developer since 2001, and my last job included creating a PCI compliant network of sites that processed millions of dollars in transactions.  
I now work full time in crypto, and MyWl.lt is my first project. I felt the community needed a secure wallet they could trust that wasn't complicated. Unfortunately I launched into a rough market (Inputs.io got hacked the day I planned to launch) and since then, nobody really trusts online wallets. I've kept advertising low key as I develop some new features and some other projects, but so far there are over 1,000 satisfied users and no security issues.
I never advocate keeping all your crypto in one spot, but there is no reason to tell people to **never** use online wallets. For the average person, most of the other options can be very confusing.  For crypto to succeed, my mother and father need to be able to send money to someone. What's easier, using blockchain.info, downloading a QT, or logging into MyWl.lt and typing "grandma into the recipient field as if using paypal?
Feel free to look at the security page on my site ([ for more information. I also welcome any questions, comments, or concerns here or via email (admin

As the developer, I'd love to prove you wrong. Have you even looked at the security breakdown?
