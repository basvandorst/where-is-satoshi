Hi Brian, if games like Hammercoin are able to use the Coinbase checkout API where a user can buy Bitcoin with a debit card on the spot, can I build a fantasy sports games that uses the same checkout modal or is that against your TOS? I've asked this question multiple places but never got an answer back.

Paying for taxes might reduce the administrative costs, and digital voting might increase turnout and provide transparency.

I was in your shoes a few years ago. Tried to convince anyone that would listen that Bitcoin is a good idea. After a while I gave up because it's all I ever talked about. 
Just let Bitcoin do its thing and let her come back with questions once she realizes it's not going away anytime soon. You can't rush it, but eventually it will happen. Or maybe not, but either way just learn to focus on things you can control. Learn how to code with the Blockchain and when she sees you making 150k writing smart contracts she might pay attention lol

I agree, I like credit cards for purchases I might return. All I'm saying is there is a lot of room for Bitcoin to fill the gap where PayPal isn't available or wanted by the merchant.

Creating a simple product is harder than building a complicated system. Also complicated systems often have ways of charging you with hidden fees because the actual cost is so hard to calculate.

PayPal is one of the worst places for merchants to deal with disputes, customers love it because PP always sides with them. 
I bet there are millions of merchants that have lost money to PayPal and billions more who will never be able to become a customer of theirs due to laws/global reach.
