Keep a positive attitude and do whatever it takes to get your money back. Stay strong, my man, you have a rocky road ahead. 
Sending prayers and keeping fingers crossed.

Decent employment with free food and accomodation. Got to remember not to drop the soap, tho.

Yeah BTC can't be overtaken at this point. Some people say Ethereum will surpass it, but it's so hard for them to make changes due to decentralized consensus, other blockchains/forks can iterate that much faster

It's just the matter of time when LN is functional and can work at scale. 
I like ADA as well. They take time and do work through a scientific approach which I think is key to maintain a certain level of security in the protocol
