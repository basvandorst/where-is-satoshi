Well that's a bit extreme.

Ledger is good for holding but a lot of people trade. Having your coins on a hard wallet makes it annoying as hell to trade. Not everybody holds.

I'm creating one after being inspired while throwing a baseball around with my pops. I'm calling it bitcoin catch.

I mean it could drop. We should be realistic. Bitcoin is still highly volatile and there is always a possibility that it can crash at any moment. If you bought into bitcoin thinking it would go straight to 1 million with no crashes or any problems then you are just naive. 
Edit: This applies to all crytos not just bitcoin.

ok guy

you don't think down 35% in 24hrs is a dip? What would you consider -$6,000 in a day then?

People leave their money on gdax so they can trade which is annoying as hell to do when all your coin is on a hardware wallet. This is an essential part of bitcoins growth. Accept it and don't call these people "re tard ed". If every single buyer held like you then the price would never change.

This is a dip. It could go lower, or it could go up from here. What happened with bitcoin in the past is a good way to understand what ***could*** happen in the future, but nobody can predict it 100%. All anyone is doing right now is guessing. 
Stop acting like you know for sure what's going to happen. You don't. Just enjoy the ride like some, or panic and stress like others.

People use it because it's simple and looks a lot like a mobile banking app. The majority of people using coinbase don't know about anything else so they don't realize the fees are so much higher.

18k to 12k isn't down? 
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:51:33
You said first it must go down but by your own definition btc is a lot more than just down.

They said on twitter that the people who are able to use coinbase are just running really slowly. When things go back to normal you should see it on your coinbase account.

Stick it up your butt. Nobody will find it there.
