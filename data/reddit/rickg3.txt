Yeah, I'm not really on board with this list, I gotta say. Firstly, Bitcoin would be an infeasible currency to use if you get stuck here after the dollar collapses, because energy cost will be so high that you'll be paying for a flight across the pond with bricks of gold bullion. Also, you know what takes a lot of energy to keep up? Networking equipment, including the routers that connect the US to the rest of the Internet. Actually, anything on this list that requires electricity is going to be more of a liability than an asset. Additionally, a pump-action shotgun is kind of a crappy weapon against a mob of looters. You'd be way better off with a nice .22 rifle and a handgun.
I'd go into more detail but I dismissed the usefulness of Bitcoin back there somewhere so I'm just going to stop here and brace for the incoming rain of blue arrows.

Guns aren't just for sociopaths, they're also for people to use for defense, feeding themselves and, of course, recreation. In fact, it's been my experience that people who dismiss firearms as the tools of criminals and psychopaths generally aren't experienced with them and are, to put it bluntly, afraid of them. Maybe you should get a little bit familiar with them before you dismiss them out of hand.

Right, that guy is indicative of your average gun owner. And that's a collection of guns, not a stockpile. And what difference does it make how many guns someone owns?
