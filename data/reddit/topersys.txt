Civil rehabitilation of mtgox is public news, not my opinion. You take whatever they offer. I just said how things went with mtgox first. Whatever we discussed here it won't make a difference anyway.

You are wrong. Company balance sheet is separate then accounting for customers who trade at exchange. Customers funds on accounts are not company assets, its not theirs money or property. Yes, they have control over accounts but that different, its not bitfinex assets, just a liability.  Who has a priv key or funds custody is irrelevant here because customer and exchange has biding agreemant. Let say btx rent a car, that car does not become their asset, it does not matter who control it. Btx has liability to pay for this service rent a car. Asset can be only company non/material property what they own!         
Bitfinex assets are thier property and money. If they get a loan from bank what they can spend like they wish (as opposed to customers deposits) it enter their balance sheet as asset and liability (double entry). Money earned from fees are their asset with is logged as money in bank on active side and profit (renevue) on the pasive side of balance sheet (there is more entries but you understand). Balance sheet has two side: one is active (+) and other is pasive (-). Each entry has an conto with description. There can be unlimited entry on both active and pasive side but balance (sum) must be zero (0). Example, 10$ earned from fees will be recorded, active(+) side conto  bank account=10$ and on pasive side (-) conto  renevue=10$     
I think you confuse active side (+) as asset and double entry what mean just a method of how to record entries and overlook big picture where is different conto plans for service company, banks, factory etc and obligated accounting for tax purpose and "accounting" for convinence to handle business.             
All customers accounting is done outside company balance sheet, they have no right to spend it, its not their asset, its just a liability  handled under agreemant with an customer. Customer did not borrowed or lent that money. Its deposited for specific purpose, in order to trade under specific agreemant with exchange and bitfinex is not owner of those funds. Bitfinex cannot take it or use it in any way outside of this agreemant and without customers consent. Of course, customers accounting can be done with double entry method but that is not usual company finance balance sheet with standard conto plan. Finally, exchange are not banks and accounting rules are different for banks and limited liability company such as bitfinex. Bank use customers funds to invest in return for interesst (all done under agreemant/contract with the customers). Exchanges company llc are totaly different story, do not mix it.

Most users overlook the fact how mtgox tried first civil rehabitilation under court supervision but that was not possible due huge loss. Liqidation is last resort. Bitfinex imo have a chance but those things need to be under supervision and oversight and after full audit and analysis of whole assets.

Synapse cost min 300$ per month. Its not for "ordinary" users.     
Edit: that cost is for platforms, not users.

That was before we knew how much gox have lost.

Company and banks have different accounting. Cell phone manufacturer have also different accounting then banana farm. Apples and oranges. Assets are non/material company property and in case of bitfinex, customers deposits are not bitfinex asset because they are not owners. They do control it but that does not mean they also own it.
