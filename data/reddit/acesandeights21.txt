A medical application that I have conisdered is tracking the chain of custody of controlled substances and medical supplies. (Although this is a different type of application than what you are talking about.)
For example, a pharmaceutical company produces 100,000 tablets of hydromorphone and creates 100,000 coins with which to track them. If 50,000 of those tablets get shipped via a carrier, then 50k coins are transferred to to the carrier. 
10,000 of the tablets are then delivered to a pharmacy and 10,000 coins would be transferred to the pharmacy. Finally, 90 tablets are given to a patient with a perscription and 90 coins are transferred to the prescribing physician.
You end up with an open and easily tracable chain of custody blockchain.

There is much more to bitcoin than how high the price can go. In fact, the price should be pretty low on the bitcoiner's list of things to worry about. (Not directing that at you necessarily, but there are many people who see price as the only validation)

what is the address or transaction id?
@_date: 2014-02-23 09:20:03
I've had that issue and quite a few others have as well. Most transactions are fine, but the problem is that coinbase does not immediately initiate a transaction when you click send and sometimes the next batch or whatever is longer than 15 minutes.

That is true, although less trust is required than if you were to hand them your credit or debit card since the potential damage is limited to the amount of change you receive.
It would also be equally easy to allow the customer to scan a QR code from their mobile device wallet to receive change with. But that would defeat the purpose of a paper only system. (unless the customer also carried a paper "change bill" which contained only the public key to a change wallet)

If nobody is using it, then training all of their new employees how to use it will not be high on their priority list. This is the problem with going around and convincing businesses to accept BTC prematurely. Small businesses will give it a shot, very few customers use it, and they lose interest. Then later when BTC is actually more viable on a local level, those owners will be more reluctant to adopt it again because all they remember is that nobody used it last time.
As someone else stated, it is probably best to just ask businesses if they accept BTC and leave it at that. Once they start hearing that over and over, then they will accept BTC organically and it will likely be more successful.

The last thing we want businesses to think is that bitcoin users are a bunch of douchebags. Even if it is unintentional. In the retail and service industries, the customer who asks to speak to a manager is generally immediately labelled a douchebag even if they aren't.

A MITM attacker would likely supply a fake certificate.
@_date: 2014-02-23 16:21:08
If the retailer is scanning the paper bill for the private key it would be simple for that retailer to have a POS that would automatically import that private key and immediately transfer all the funds to another address that they control. Then the POS could immediately generate a new address to send the change to. A new paper bill could be printed with that new change address's keys that would be given to the customer. 
So the transaction would be: Clerk scans your coffee, you give the clerk your BTC bill, they scan it, and your change bill gets printed out. Could all happen within a second or two. No need to be very worried about double spends or waiting for confirmations.

A newly minted (aka immature) coin can't be spent for 100 confirmations to prevent it from disappearing from the blockchain in case of a reorganization. A new coin has no history so if the block in which it was minted becomes orphaned, then those new coins disappear forever.

What exactly do you propose that they do differently? Not follow AML laws?
@_date: 2014-02-12 22:33:50
Exactly. I'd love to believe that the market could sustain itself with no block size limit, but that's quite a gamble to take. If you take that gamble and lose, that could mean the collapse of bitcoin. 
Maintaining a block size limit is insurance for miners (and indirectly for everyone else who uses bitcoin).

@_date: 2014-02-02 12:34:19
I don't think you understand. The purpose of purchase is what is being expressed in the math.
Let me simplify it a bit:
Let's say I have two apple seeds that I am planning on growing into two apple trees. Then someone comes along and wants one of my apple seeds. I can give them one of my apple seeds and then immediately purchase a new apple seed to replace the one I gave away and still grow them into two apple trees. I would have never had three apple trees and all that I have lost is the dollar to replace that apple seed.
You are misappropriating this "miner's fallacy" that you are quoting. It is accurate *unless* you replace the bitcoins that you gave away with new bitcoins purchased with dollar bills at the same market price as the price at the time you gave it away. The only thing that changed after the complete transaction is the number of dollar bills in your bank account. This is the same as purchasing the miner with dollar bills.
Hope that clears things up.

This is the best advice anyone can give about bitcoin. It is easy to get sucked into the get-rich-quick, *what's the price today* trap and lose sight of what is truly remarkable about bitcoin: The fact that it is a platform for innovation that will take us places and give us tools in the future that we haven't even thought of yet.

@_date: 2014-01-20 01:55:15
Ha. Everybody checked stock quotes back in the day. Even though most of us didn't own stock.

Replacing spent bitcoin with new bitcoin makes the transaction equal a fiat transaction mathematically. The math is all that matters, anything else is philosophical

Why do you need to buy the horse?

If we never reinvented the wheel, we would still be driving around on cylinders made of rock. It would basically work, but we can do way better.
@_date: 2017-01-23 06:41:02
This reminds me of the good old days of mining.
@_date: 2015-04-21 21:24:35
Well, it's in beta so it's more about what do you have to offer OpenBazaar
@_date: 2015-11-05 01:19:14
And you are seeing the results you should expect for that size:fee ratio. 
@_date: 2015-11-08 02:04:44
Are you running bitcoind?
How much swap space have you set up? Set up a few gigs of swap space if you aren't using it at all. Downloading the entire blockchain takes a ton of memory. After a day or so when it is done downloading, it's memory usage will go way down.
@_date: 2015-02-09 21:27:16
You are the one who is uninformed. [This comment]( explains it very well.
@_date: 2015-02-03 10:20:13
Except FinCen has ruled that bitcoin counts as a currency and the same regulations are applicable as USD.
@_date: 2015-02-05 00:48:57
Because they know they will almost certainly lose the trial, so they place their bets on setting up an appeal that has better odds of succeeding.
@_date: 2015-02-16 16:55:45
I'm not sure what to say other than that is illogical hogwash.
@_date: 2015-02-10 10:03:21
Well there are no chargebacks with bitcoin of course, so that isn't an issue. The potential issue a retailer would have is someone trying to spend the same coins twice. But that is very difficult to do and would generally be very expensive to do, so anyone trying to do that is only going to target high dollar items (even that would be nearly impossible). For day-to-day type purchases the odds of someone trying to double spend against you is so low that it's not worth even thinking about.
Plus if you are using a third party payment processor, they generally will assume that risk and allow zero confirmation transactions.
Even with zero confimations, the deal is done once the coins are sent. The confirmations are just added peace of mind.
@_date: 2015-02-02 12:54:35
It doesn't matter what currency you use. Cryptsy still has to follow US anti money laundering laws for any currency they deal in (including bitcoin).
@_date: 2015-02-09 21:23:59
The difference is that for most transactions you don't *need* a fast confirmation time. For high value and high risk transactions, a fee to help guarantee quick confirmations is more akin to buying insurance.
@_date: 2015-02-04 21:46:10
Or in the case of a decentralized, concensus-based currency like bitcoin, anyone who mines or runs a node is a controller, administrator, and issuer.
@_date: 2015-02-06 18:07:54
Circle is the only legitimate place that I am aware of.
@_date: 2015-02-11 09:41:43
Uh, no, read it again. All of it. It uses current data to find an average transaction size rather than the theoretical minimum transaction size.
@_date: 2015-11-30 15:23:28
And by other major players you mean organizations like bitstamp?
@_date: 2015-02-04 21:52:44
I haven't followed this case very closely, but generally in a case like this when the defendant has a very weak defense, their main goal in the trial is to set themselves up for appeals.
@_date: 2015-02-16 16:17:05
Absolutely not. Competitive people want to be the best and that's what motivates them to compete, not fear of the future losers.
@_date: 2015-02-16 16:42:53
The fear of losing is unrelated to a fear of competitors. Not that a fear of competitors isn't a thing, but it generally does not create motivation in a competitive person.
@_date: 2013-11-29 20:49:48
Exactly. Not everything in life needs to be dumbed down. It's just not worth the confusion.
@_date: 2013-12-14 09:54:07
I don't see this ending well.
@_date: 2013-12-30 22:29:40
Considering that your bank has to support this type of verification, I doubt it is against the agreement.
@_date: 2013-11-15 00:15:30
If you found out that a financial crime once occurred at your home would you move?
@_date: 2013-12-02 00:52:46
Why would use use wire?
@_date: 2013-11-08 19:52:45
So I guess it is safe to assume that he did not have insurance on his business.
@_date: 2013-11-01 00:57:23
It is one thing to be interested in something, but it is another to be invested in it (even on a small scale).
@_date: 2013-12-14 15:45:20

@_date: 2013-12-14 09:52:40
If I recall correctly there was a similar type of card being sold at Walmart and other places a year or two ago. Nobody bought it.
@_date: 2013-11-09 19:09:48
Yes, but we are talking about the hash rate estimate.
@_date: 2013-12-14 15:32:27
Just ignore the idiots. They will never go away.
@_date: 2013-12-05 02:00:32
Technically bitcoin could be done without computers or electricity just the same as dollars or any other fiat, but it would be extremely inefficient. I can picture a gigantic scroll where users come to write in their transactions surrounded by thousands of miners furiously doing math using quill pens and parchment paper.
@_date: 2013-12-06 12:31:45
Yep, thats how it works. They usually also offer payday advances.
@_date: 2013-11-11 01:48:56
This. Gas and groceries
@_date: 2013-12-04 01:00:03
Thats cool but we are talking about whether or not some states require no background check at all
@_date: 2013-12-04 05:13:46
Yep. I wish more states would make the sherriff position an elected one. This helps insure that the police are following the will of the people and not just their own agenda.
@_date: 2013-12-07 01:33:47
I used to think bitcoiners were rational.
@_date: 2013-12-10 12:44:05
I think your obvious next move is to not do business with a bank that thinks they can be your daddy.
@_date: 2013-12-04 00:22:17
The federal law requires everyone to get a background check
@_date: 2013-12-02 08:47:39
Glad I stopped using that site due to the lack of money management.
@_date: 2013-11-15 00:18:07
The solution that best supports bitcoin is to spend bitcoins anywhere that you can but immediately purchase new coins to replace what you spent. Your bitcoin nest egg remains untouched and you have helped to promote bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-09 19:08:49
Not sure how all that relates to insurance, but cool.
@_date: 2013-12-22 23:34:11
Probably hacked again
@_date: 2013-12-13 21:50:17
and we all know how that worked out.
@_date: 2013-11-11 01:52:22
Yes, that gets on my nerves, too.
@_date: 2013-12-14 11:48:33
Just my memory. I can't recall what they were called but I'm sure I will remember at some random time later.
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:27:38
I agree completely. Luckily I sold out a few weeks ago so I am able to sleep well at night.

Anyone who had purchased very many gift cards on bitmit can attest to the fact that gift card fraud is rampant.

And now just-dice closes and the owner retires. The End

Yeah it has long been proven not to give you an edge unless you have an unlimited bankroll (literally unlimited which is impossible).
@_date: 2013-12-02 02:57:57
There may be far more hands than you realize
@_date: 2013-12-19 21:33:33
They need to leave that determination up to the police.
@_date: 2013-11-22 23:37:38
@_date: 2013-12-14 09:49:52
They kicked you out for being a lame copycat.
@_date: 2013-12-03 07:28:41
No. The background check is a federal requirement meaning that everyone has to get one no matter what state you are in. Remember the Brady Bill?
@_date: 2013-12-06 12:37:37
Probably so
@_date: 2013-12-18 15:29:29
I agree with that.
@_date: 2013-12-06 12:21:37
There are MANY people without checking accounts. Usually due to having an account closed with a negative balance. There is a system that checks for that when you open a new account anywhere and they will not allow you to open an account if this is the case. Seems that people without bank accounts cash their checks at check cashing services.
@_date: 2013-11-21 22:58:04
Anyone else get tired of people not knowing what a ponzi scheme really is?
@_date: 2013-12-18 14:56:02
In all honestly you should probably be a little worried.
@_date: 2013-12-03 07:24:10
It seems to me that accepting tons of money in bitcoin donations would be in the best interest of their fiduciary duty.

Wow, there is someone with some sense here on Reddit!
@_date: 2013-12-01 10:57:38
Something that nobody else has thought of

Do they get Bloomberg News in China? China was leading the sell-off and I assume they understand Mandarin.

I guess that is one way to prevent her from spending all bitcoins on coffee.
@_date: 2013-11-08 19:59:57
I believe that they use the average solve time to ESTIMATE the hash rate. Chicken or egg?
@_date: 2013-12-27 22:45:12
You didn't expect to win did you?
@_date: 2013-12-07 07:39:40
I'm glad to see we are heading toward a more reasonable price

Not to start a political debate but congress suffers from the "every congressman is terrible except the one I voted for" which isn't an issue with elected officials who are not part of a larger governing body.

Who wouldn't buy that?
@_date: 2013-11-24 00:28:26
I wouldn't worry too much about that. It is far riskier for them to withdraw from your bank account than vice versa. They would need to wait an extra day or two after the bank withdrawal to be reasonably sure that the bank does not reverse the ACH. 
@_date: 2013-11-15 01:53:14
