Credit card psychology is we get 'rewarded' for spending on our cards. Even if paid in full each month, I think the incentives cause us to spend more than we would have without it. Everyone knows nothing is "free" or else businesses would not exist. Of course, take advantage of cash back rewards at the gas pump or on necessities, but the average user will never *beat* the CC companies and will spend extra at McDonald's when swiping.

Introduced to the world? What you got right was it wasn't nearly as well known before 2017, but it is still not known. Most people do not know of Bitcoin.. and for the ones who do, most have not even created a BTC wallet. I agree with you many potential investors watched it peak and die however, lets not mistake them for the general population.

If you choose to store your seeds on a computer, encrypt the file, use a strong passphrase (instead of a password). As your accounts get larger, implement further security measures.
