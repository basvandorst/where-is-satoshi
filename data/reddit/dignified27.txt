So if I have Electrrum wallet already and connect a seperate trezor wallet, the Electrrum will recognize it and sync, or would I have to make it compatible upon setup of brand new Electrrum or mycelium wallets?
@_date: 2016-08-03 19:22:07
If there wast a HF after EmptyGox why would we have one now??
@_date: 2016-08-24 21:20:20
Trezor Harware wallet, most secure plus you save your seed and it can sweep all your coins to mycelium, electrum, copay I think breadwallet...etc etc etc 
@_date: 2016-08-24 17:31:38

We essentially have a more transparent system then ever, cellphones have penetrated 3rd world countries as of now, imagine buying from your local trader joes who's organic food comes from a farm.in Kenya for example, each employee of the farm and the farm itself can post addresses they own that can be cryptographically verified, what I'm trying to say is you can trace your bitcoin purchase straight to someone else  in a 3rd world country and be sure no corrupt fuck is skimming alil off the top..
@_date: 2016-08-20 00:14:32
Ty for this
@_date: 2016-08-03 19:19:57

Well when you set up your trezor you hopefully made multiple copies of your "recovery seed" which you can use to recover your coins if your trezor ever broke or got lost etc.
Electrrum supports importing seeds generated from trezor and mycelium as well, with alil digging you can find some tutorials on sweeping your addresses and what other wallet providers you can use with the trezor recovery seed.
@_date: 2016-08-28 00:17:36
Compared to coinbase was much more noob friendly imo, I don't understand if you having nothing contructive to add GFY

Well can we agree on the fact that one chain will win out and that will be decided by the users traders speculators and investors if you would like to call them that.
If the community becomes aware and a threat occurs it wouldn't be too long to be obvious, even ghash.io caused  an uproar a year or so ago and people moved miners off that pool.
Satoshi was better at game theory than you or I, probably combined, there are checks and balances within the Bitcoin protocol, and Bitcoin beliebers 
@_date: 2016-08-04 18:55:35

@_date: 2016-08-18 19:59:16
No its really not overhyped,  there is a balance of power that has been developed, between one cpu one vote,aka miners, and whoever maintains the open source code that is vetted by people not even of the core team, instead because it's open source as satoshi released his/her code and that of all the other peoples' code he/she used by giving credit to where it was due.
Now all this is assuming people believe the blockchain works and will continue to work at any price level. 
It will work as intended for people who use it whether it be of legal or other means, bitcoin has so far reached a use case where even huge swings in price doesn't scare off the lot of people who have been around for awhile,. 
It is volatile, everyone should come here understanding this. What I'm getting at is the use case of the users/traders/speculators/hodlers which believe in the blockchain and it's immutability have the final say, there is a silent majority, sort of like trump supporters not to get politcal.
The people will choose the true blockchain at the end of the day. 
All blockchain alternatives would not exist today if it wasn't for Bitcoin and satoshi, at the end of the day I believe alts will be where huge developmental ideas will come for bitcoin to then adopt and remain dominant however that is just my opinion, take it with a grain of salt.
@_date: 2016-08-22 06:41:44

Copy your receiving address into blockchain. Info (make sure you go to the right one and not the scam ad if you Google it) it should show address sent from &gt;&gt; sent to and on top the bunch of numbers and letters is your TX id or transaction id
In the future send a higher fee most wallets will have easy UI'S for this, it's really worth it.

Not tryna troll or nothing, I understand blocks have recently.been full and myy.own txs sometimes take longer than I'd like to...but it's still technically in beta phase....and we will have bitcoin absorb alt coin advancememts, if you think not be my.guest, lightning network, segwit finally.fix TX malleability a la karpeles, and I think compact blocks or xthin not sure...I'm no shill just been around since before 2013 bubble and that's my take

This is happening to alot of people right now don't trust anything yet you can always sweep the keys with your seed worst case scenario but I'd wait awhile to get a formal update from satoshilabs soon

Plz explain how bitcoin =/= blockchain technology, if it was the first ever blockchain...granted we have alts but they aren't shit compared with Bitcoin.
Sounds like how all those banker shills trying to separate bitcoin and the blockchain, which is all just pretty words at the end of the day...

While they all make good points, a miner that doesn't immediately dump coins as they are mined, is essentially taking one more coin off the market and reducing supply, however negligible it may be...
As to having a HUGE impact on price would depend on the demand at the current time on the market, and if you really believe reported volumes on Chinese exchanges

It's open source, let them do what they want, but the fact that bitcoin is money not decreed by a government is one of its core strengths; that any corporate or governmental imitation of its systems will fail to overshadow bitcoin and it's use cases.

I am of the opinion that bitcoins use in these illegal markets legitimizes bitcoin in that criminals if you will, always accept strong currencies, for example dollars, euros, gold, diamonds etc. And that being on the fringe as criminals usually are gives them a reason to "stay ahead of the competition" and maybe find use in new things that show promise even if only in the short term.

Can someone please ElI5 why they always refer to their bank chain as a blockchain, I mean isn't the only reason we use the blockchain or the only reason it was invented was because of decentralization?  To clarify would there be any mining of blocks on their blockchain?
More and more I feel like they are just using the word over and over to sound innovative while taking all the innovation out... correct me if I'm wrong but I am under the impression satoshi nakamoto invented the blockchain..

Bitcoin is a scientific truth of events witnessed aka the blockchain over the past 7 years and it's been working for you information, people have been writing Bitcoin is dead articles since 2011 when the price peaked at 15$ and last I checked Bitcoin has proved it's resilience time.and time again, this current blocksize debate will be settled in due time, and the honey badger will continue trucking while people continue hating. 
If you have alot of haters, you're doing something right.

"Bitcoin was created in 2008 under the name of Satoshi Nakamoto, a programmer or a group of programmers, and does not operate through a central bank. Rather a network of volunteers validate transactions via their computers, which require encrypted electronic signatures, and in return earn fees based on market prices."
It's so hard to explain bitcoin, especially in one paragraph.

An address which is just a hash from a pubkey needs to spend to broadcast your pubkey as proof that you own the private key
As long as you only sent coins to an address and have never spent from it you are fine

Are you saying that if people are doing nothing wrong then privacy is a dead issue?
Didn't see that in The Constitution 
@_date: 2016-09-18 12:02:49
 Because pub key is derived mathematically from the private key,  when you spend from an address you are broadcasting the public key to the blockchain as proof you own the private key
It also lowers security from 160 bit to 128bit

One basic difference  between a wage slave and a slave is that slave owners would clothe and provide food and shelter for the slaves, in this day and age the wage slave is forced to feed and shelter themselves.

They do alot better to  maintain the purchasing power lost due to inflation and possibly even gains on top have you ever met a financial advisor that tells you to hold all your wealth in cash lmfao

Pretty sure satoshi said same thing, yes found link 
@_date: 2016-05-29 18:09:19
Theoretically yes at current computing power and the fact that crypt analysis has yet to uncover any weaknesses in Sha 256. 
 
The amount of possible private keys are beyond numbers average joes can comprehend and brute forcing is currently unfeasible even on addresses that are reused but there's always luck..

Heyy me tooo, seem to be in the same boat, nice to see I'm not the only one lol

He should of covered his own ass before blogging about some shit that wasn't even confirmed, I mean how did he expect the community to react? Succumb to an appeal to authority? skepticism is healthy round these parts..
@_date: 2016-05-03 22:36:48
Wage slave is referring to debt that drives our entire economy, how money is brought into existence through debt and how most of us have to take out loans to buy properties and start businesses and pay back interest on top of it, and don't forget the hidden tax on the poor called inflation because of continously printing money and the interest owed on that..and how it's all a game of musical chairs and someone's always left out to dry and blah blah blah smoking too much haze /rant

Funny with all these problems that were "improved upon" by all these shit coins none really caught on and bitcoin still reigns supreme
@_date: 2016-05-30 05:51:00
That's why I keep less than 1 percent of my holdings with them if I wanna buy something. Otherwise never had any issues.
@_date: 2016-05-02 13:43:00
Isn't he doing that anyway..
@_date: 2016-05-18 13:45:58
Feels like they want to avoid saying "THE" blockchain, as that may imply there is an original and it's singular, and if one looks deeper they will discover bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-05-05 13:07:24
Lmfaooooo

Speak for yourself I hate slimy conmen

Why did they not speak up earlier, sounds like reinforcements to me
@_date: 2016-07-19 23:13:26
Hmm good point
Buy the fucking dip
@_date: 2016-07-18 02:22:43
I agree let it be, explaining bitcoin in a clear concise manner was even difficult for the creator hence the if you don't understand I don't have time to convince you quote.
@_date: 2016-07-07 18:26:10
@_date: 2016-07-27 15:04:02
This deserves more attention, +1

@_date: 2016-07-26 00:29:06
Why don't you purchase gold or silver with your bitcoins then go to your local coin shop and do your best to get spot price losing out on a couple bucks for the premium but hey it'll work
@_date: 2016-07-17 16:37:59
Why is this not more popular, am I the only one that feels it should be?
@_date: 2016-07-24 16:10:13
I don't see how you can unless you know the exact time they made the transfers. Any amount can be spilt and all go to the same wallet while residing at different addresses so there's really no way in knowing who it belongs to at all
@_date: 2016-07-07 01:50:51

I'd say wait for a dip, don't buy on 2 year highs

Someone at least sees clearly.

If he does off himself maybe that'll sway future slimy conmen..maybe not

When was bitcoin forked after an exchange hack
@_date: 2016-07-18 16:18:47
Honestly I'm just content for a smooth transition, the hashrate didn't drop too far to cause such significant delays we heard might happen, the price seems like it's remaining as stable as ever, working as intended from my point of view
@_date: 2016-07-22 20:18:11
Lol bitcoin never hard forked after any exchange hack including Gox
So no, there's a big difference
@_date: 2016-07-14 21:56:21
Can't tell if sarcasm

Who isn't here for the long hodl?
@_date: 2016-07-11 02:04:21
Because private keys means you have full ownership over your own keys, otherwise using coinbase like a bank goes against what bitcoin was founded for
@_date: 2016-07-12 04:01:23
I personally enjoy the stability, huge price swings in either direction feel unnatural

I realize dao=/= exchange, but the dao is where alot of people with no relation to each other stored their funds much like an exchange, dao got outsmarted and drained now a HF am I missing something? 
@_date: 2016-07-14 01:31:55
As much as I disagree, people have a right to their opinions and if the majority agree no matter how dumb the reasoning opinions and stances may be they become norms, just imagine a trump presidency.

@_date: 2016-07-09 18:03:28
Yea cringeworthy
@_date: 2016-07-25 00:42:48
None besides speculation, if we remain stable I'd be happy
@_date: 2016-07-10 22:01:31
Are they turning into fucking scammers

Damn Dick Tracy, nice DD
@_date: 2016-07-12 19:51:51
I feel like this will become more common and common sense will be it's main driver.
This is why I have my own belief that IF Bitcoin succeeds it will be through this type of organic growth.
@_date: 2016-07-09 16:50:16
We wuz here!!!
@_date: 2016-07-03 03:14:34
Yes and yes, this is all true, the blockchain or history of all transactions maps the private keys with UTXOs, private keys exist even if their associated address or pubkeyhash isn't on chain, that's the data structure in my understanding.
@_date: 2016-07-14 07:50:05
I saw it and was wondering if that was bankchain.
And you know the better alternative still trucking while shit propaganda continues on.
@_date: 2016-07-24 16:40:10
Hmmm I like this understanding pretty much how I see it

I think that etc and what's happening with ethereum is more concerning all of crypto than just eth itself. It showing what would happen with a community that is each exercising their rights within this system satoshi nakamoto invented.

He may be a nutjob but some of his points do make sense
@_date: 2016-07-24 16:36:13
Yes like he said the Merkele root is a concatenation of all the transaction id's hashes in that particular block and most importantly through proof of work are easily verified to have been "worked upon." Which makes proof of work such a strong algo imo. Easily verified but also has to be worked on with real time and energy, no efficient workaround to that exists, yet.

We have more US dollar in circulation than 1.6trillion, think that's just base currency. 
@_date: 2016-07-07 01:47:34
Haha I had the same thought
@_date: 2016-07-03 20:48:09
Yes ofc, utoxs are basically addresses (pubkeyhash) of any privkey that controls any electronic signature aka bitcoins
@_date: 2016-07-04 11:28:03
No, he's right. If Bitcoin wasn't "scarce" I doubt many early adopters/hodlers would even be here. There aren't many Keynesian's round these parts.
@_date: 2016-07-31 19:42:03
A drop of 30$ after almost a month of stability is collapse?? TIL...
@_date: 2016-07-10 22:03:43
I only keep chump change in coinbase, I have been a customer with then since early 2014 but they are shady for sure
@_date: 2016-07-14 07:49:26
@_date: 2016-07-24 16:26:49
Yes, if you ain't holding the private keys, what's the diff if uncle same freezes your accts &amp; assets 
@_date: 2016-07-09 06:44:38
@_date: 2016-07-11 19:32:09
And it will fade after the hype has passed, can we say the same about cryptos?
