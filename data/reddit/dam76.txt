the minimum accepted fee is 1 satoshi/byte, and the median transaction size is around 200bytes. So you would pay 200 to send 1, but you can.

The point is not that BTC users don't want privacy. The problem is that offuscated transactions are huge compared to normal ones, and would fill blocks or need more fees or need a bigger block size (so less centralization). So Monero privacy comes with strings attached. In fact, before being implemented with Monero, that feature had been proposed for BTC (and the same was for Zero Knowledge Proofs, the other way to obtain privacy).

It is a complex matter, but if it does not go out of hand, printing money in a limited, controlled and thoughtful matter can be a good thing for the economy.
Very simply put, there a two main reason:
* a very small and controlled amount of inflation (ECB target is 2%) is considered good. There is a lot of economic literacy that confirms this. The problem is when the Central Bank is not independent and the government can impose higher inflation to finance its program.
* we already know that there are economic cycles (ups and downs) through the years and we would like to mitigate them. Monetary policy is one way to do that, and that is what this tweet is about.

I see a lot of distrust about Economics here, but like all the other sciences, we cannot know absolute truths, we can just make tests and see the results.
The replies I can give to you with much confidence are to the last two:
No, usually cycles are not caused by monetary policy. I suppose they are caused by the irrationality of the actors involved in the markets. They existed also with the gold standard and before.
Yes, monetary (and fiscal) policy is just a patch, and often does not work.

What we are talking about here, it is gold as a reserve of value. We are not using Bitcoin to make jewels.
In that regards Bitcoin is better than gold because is easier to store and transfer and the supply is limited.
But the concept of reserve of value is something that has something to do with the mind and the psicology of the creditors, that is the hardest thing to change and will take an awful lot of time.
If you tihink about it, gold has value because people thinks that has value. No other reason.

I think that it would more feasible to make a single larger transaction, and then gain a credit that you can spend in the shop in the next days.

The point you are missing is that within the new block you also have to compute the hash of the previous block (therefore the term blockchain). Even if the second block were transaction-free, you cannot make a correct second block without the hash of the first one. The simple explanation is that clocks of the miners are not always in sync, but they do not need to, it is not the timestamp that orders the block.

you would have 0 income for long periods of time, and with a certain frequency, you would earn 12.5 BTC+block transaction fees.
At current difficult rates:
* to get a block, on average, you have to perform 2,4E+22 hashes - how long it takes for you to do that, depends on your setup
* being on a pool allows you to earn 1BTC (minus pool fees) on average every 1,9E+21 hashes
before going into mining it is important to understand how it works!
