The most important part of this article, IMO:

Is the link between porn and emerging markets as direct or compelling as everyone makes it out to be? I've seen a couple examples of porn deciding the winner between competitors in emerging markets, but I've also seen examples of porn getting it wrong. 
Do people just make up these connections because sex grabs attention and the idea of "porn deciding a winner" in emerging markets is an entertaining and compelling thought? 
Either way, more acceptance for BTC is a good thing.

I will organize this. I promise all your coins will get back to you if we don't win the bid! Pinky swear!

Obviously African adoption of BTC would be a huge leap forward. One that could have astounding geopolitical ramifications, potentially freeing entire countries from the oppressive effects of fiat currencies. 
But what stands in the way? What barriers to entry are there for widespread African adoption?

But you're still having to get a vpn with your first method. Idk about the anonymity of a vps but that one sounds interesting.

" Although initially charged with planning six murders, Ross was not indicted in New York for any. In November prosecutor Serrin Turner used the murder-for-hire allegations to argue against bail being granted, yet he did not indict Ulbricht for these allegations in February."
This is straight from the website. Your trolling attempts are bad and you should feel bad.

I never thought I would see the day where I watched two Glen Beck clips in two days. 
Everyone is right, bitcoin does destroy lives.

You can't though. And if you could, you would state how instead of being vague.

She said the charges were dropped in the video you clearly didn't watch.

This is literally giving me cancer to ask, but what would go into crowdfunding a potential commercial for bitcoin on glen beck's program?

Can't torrent with tor though

My bad, meant to say you can't torrent anonymously via tor. 
And there is a level of trust using any system that you didn't develop and maintain solely on your own. Every day you use tor you are trusting that the system isn't completely compromised and observed by the NSA.

Only thing I've seen from them so far is a cooking show with Action Bronson called "Fuck, That's Delicious". 
If they could make a bitcoin payment show called "Fuck, That's Easy" I guess I'd be down.

Nope. Actual cancer.

SHA-256 was first created by the NSA, and it's the hashing algorithm that btc is built on. 
There was also this white paper the NSA worked on in 1996 that outlines about 90% of bitcoin protocol

I would instantly trade the "credibility" of my reddit account for 25 bucks. What the fuck does a credible reddit account even mean? And how would anyone outside of your sub know that I've "lost credibility"?
I'm all for trying new things with bitcoin but this is really stupid.

This sounds like so much fun.  I've always just bought and hodl butcoin, but I watch twitch a lot and would 100% jump in on something like this.

From my understanding they don't sell metadata, they sell flaws about websites back to those sites. 
I had a really interesting conversation with one of their representatives at PAX South and he was saying that websites like to know where their vulnerabilities lay so they pay a lot of money to know when an end user is unable to access their site and for whatever reason.
