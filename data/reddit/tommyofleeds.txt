But in this case the burger guy’s burger will be much better. Not really a good comparison.

eTorro have signed deals with 7 Premier League clubs and are paying them in Bitcoin.

I don’t know, I’ve never used it, and I’ve heard bad things about them. Fair play to them though, for pushing crypto forward into big time sports.
@_date: 2018-05-04 14:56:14
Dash, last year, I believe.
@_date: 2018-05-10 23:25:33
What are the benefits? Is there a medium post or anything that lays out the benefits to having your own LN node?
@_date: 2018-05-12 01:43:39
A few days before Consensus and after a steady bullish run. Somehow, I wonder if it’s all orchestrated ��
@_date: 2018-05-10 23:23:24
What is the benefits to launching your own?
@_date: 2018-05-04 06:29:41
Whatever a douchebag is, I really have no idea, but you need to do some research yourself because he has scammed people/companies.
@_date: 2018-05-04 06:28:18
Check out how he had Dash over. He took a big payment from Dash to bring them their very own debit card (MasterCard I believe). Anyway, he didn’t deliver, but he hasn’t paid anything back. 
@_date: 2018-05-04 03:01:54
Not sure why you’re getting downvoted, he is a scammer.

Have you never heard of Metcalfe’s Law? 
@_date: 2018-05-13 03:16:25
Maybe they don’t want to have to work around sanctions that America will put on them because Saudi Arabia wants them to.
@_date: 2018-05-21 10:56:49
Fucking nonsense video 
@_date: 2018-10-15 03:03:44
Are they only up and running in North America?
@_date: 2018-10-15 06:47:15
Ok, thanks for the info!
@_date: 2018-10-18 13:38:29
Don’t listen to what institutions say; watch what they do instead.
@_date: 2018-10-18 23:50:54
I’m saying absolutely the opposite. They call it a scam and spread fud to lower the price, and then they get in. They’re not only getting in as buying coins, but they’re purchasing or setting up major pieces of crypto infrastructure.
@_date: 2018-06-07 12:52:41
They’re doing quite well without selling them to Americans. Your market isn’t the be all of everything.
@_date: 2018-06-19 09:58:26
Ok, that’s some interesting points you’ve made there. Thanks.
@_date: 2018-06-07 13:20:33
All markets affect everything and Wall St. is the biggest, but this is global. Nothing has ever been global like this before, and the ones who decide against it will be left behind. Wall St will make sure your govt is crypto friendly, however.
@_date: 2018-06-10 06:58:27
True enough, but as you say, it’s highly unlikely with bitcoin. Too many people value it’s system to let it rot.
@_date: 2018-06-07 22:49:41
Bring your eyes back around, sunshine. Many are penny stocks, but if you don’t believe blockchain is going to disrupt and revolutionise business, you don’t understand it. Use it or fall behind, simple.
@_date: 2018-06-09 06:59:30
It can’t go to zero. I won’t sell mine if the price plummets.
@_date: 2018-06-18 05:59:44
What are you talking about? Revolution entered the national conscious in 2011? Wtf, lol.
Also the nightclub chain have been around for a long time, about 10 years or more before your 2011 claim.
@_date: 2019-02-10 12:11:18
Hodl and wait.

Does anybody doubt there’ll eventually be multiple ETFs?
@_date: 2019-02-07 08:17:10
Because Roger Ver is a scammer
@_date: 2019-02-10 14:59:59
Blinded by greed? You’ve got a lot to learn. I haven’t paid anywhere near 10k for a btc. Oh, and good luck with timing the market.
@_date: 2019-04-10 13:30:58
Ah, ok. Thanks a lot!!!
@_date: 2019-04-10 15:09:45
Just read the next bit of your comment, and I agree, totally. Thanks a lot for your feedback!
@_date: 2019-04-09 22:50:55
True enough
@_date: 2019-04-09 14:27:31
We're a long way away from that price, but we can dream.

If he stole the Btc, they should go after him. He has fleeced others, too.

Japanese government. Their economy is most indebted, and they’re the most welcoming of all governments. What did they have to lose? Their economy is going under anyway...
@_date: 2018-02-18 06:13:44
Why didn’t you buy in at 6k?
@_date: 2018-02-05 13:17:07
If you need to spend the 5k you invested, you invested too much.
@_date: 2018-03-11 10:33:15
Coinfloor is a good place to buy and sell bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-03-31 04:46:01
Not sure how much your tax rebates usually are over there but a million people with an extra $1000, who coincidently want to put it all into crypto, seems a little far fetched. I hope you’re right, but I think the best strategy is to be patient and no expect.
@_date: 2018-03-03 13:17:43
The capability? Of course, governments have intelligent people working for them, just not the politicians. I think they’re being so private about it because it wouldn’t please all their allies.
@_date: 2018-03-31 02:39:57
Most money in crypto isn’t coming from America, so that won’t be as significant as you think. It’ll go back up when it’s regulated enough for the institutions to put their money in.
@_date: 2018-02-23 13:17:37
Anybody who bought back then would not have hodl all this time. No way.
@_date: 2018-03-03 14:43:49
Not sure what you mean reagrding the British newspaper/location.
As for Satoshi not being a coding expert. Maybe not, but he/they created something that nobody else could. It started something that naturally coding experts are evolving.

He’s better off keeping his hard earned money in the bank where he can get a safe 0.25% pa

Entering a bear phase? It’s been bearish since Jan 11. IMO, there will be a little more blood on the streets before the next pump. Maybe in 2-3 weeks we’ll see bullish times.
@_date: 2018-07-26 12:27:19
Anybody getting into crypto should watch Andreas’ videos. He is the most intelligent and eloquent speaker.
@_date: 2018-04-12 12:05:07
It’s my birthday too, all the best, mate! Great day to get things started again ��
@_date: 2018-04-28 10:09:55
What a dumb incoherent rant. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 04:11:37
Quality! ��
@_date: 2018-04-19 10:05:32
What right does the NYAG have though?
@_date: 2018-04-19 09:55:04
Agree totally, and let’s be honest: this is bullish news! Amazon will be accepting bitcoin soon. 
@_date: 2018-04-26 06:19:03
And watch as many Andreas Antonoplous speeches on YouTube as you can.
And once you have enough skin in the game, get a Trezor hardware wallet.

The shackles have been in for too long. Gemini are also starting Blocktrades today, so big buyers might be getting in before it opens soon.

If you think Exxon and international investors is the answer to their problems, you’re part of the problem.

Ver is an attention seeking cunt and just like his mate, he’s a fraud and is trying to con people about BTC.
@_date: 2018-04-26 05:15:57
No disadvantage at all. It’s a free market with all different sized trades. Welcome to the Wild West.
@_date: 2018-04-02 04:08:31
How long would you have to wait for the the transaction to go through...
@_date: 2018-04-01 23:41:37
But if it back the currency to replace fiat, they would have to spend it as well, no? Therefore, releasing it back onto the market.
@_date: 2018-04-01 23:15:42
No, because the market cap would be so big it would be virtually impossible to manipulate.
@_date: 2018-04-11 12:40:17
He’s a convicted felon and is now trying to scam people through bitcoin. Absolute cunt!
@_date: 2018-04-19 11:23:10
But as you said, its not their jurisdiction. Shouldn't this come from an international auditing organisation?

Not exactly Mr Current Affairs, are ya?
