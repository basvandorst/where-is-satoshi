When did I criticize market economies at all? It is the purely theoretical retort (mainly an a priori assumption, but that is lost on ideologues) about how "the best solution is already out there, its' because you don't really value it that you don't have it" response that is fringe and purely ideological. I'm actually amazed that the guy wasn't avalanched with upvotes. I guess community isn't AS ridiculous as I thought it was.

I'll grant you twat, but you're just pulling shit out of your ass about teenage and socialist. Noticing where I am now, it's not a surprise to see such butthurt ideologues defending ridiculous ideas. The bitcoin community rivals extremist islamists in ideological circlejerking.

It wasn't snide at all. It was a genuine delusion based on a fringe interpretation of conventional economics.

Derp everything you could possibly need will be provided by the market derp I'm extremely ideological and answer everything based on idealized situations based on unproven assumptions. I'm an armchair economic theorist derp

You can use real money to create smart contracts, there is nothing about bitcoin that makes it a special case in that regard.

Instant profits? Did you not read his post? You're basically proving his point that he expected irrational backlash.
He said that he doesn't think it will ever catch on as a normal payment method.

He said "If you have ATM fees, it's **because you deliberately want ATM fees.**" He's being completely circular. 
You have ATM fees because you want ATM fees. You obviously wanted ATM fees because you have them, why else would you have them?
That is the jist of what he was saying. I can only assume that he is confused about microeconomics and the various ideas that have come out it. His use of strong words like "deliberately want" tells me that he has a vague understanding of a particular brand of microeconomics that he has gleaned from youtube videos, blogs, and subreddits such as this one.

People are generally irrational and form many of their opinions of things that affect many people on the basis of their personal minuscule experience. No argument here, there is a lot of irrationality in that regard.

Anyone that responds with "teenage socialist" to even a trolly critique of fringe economics is themselves a butthurt ideologue.

Teenage socialist twat? I can see I struck a nerve in the religious community here.
Just noticed I was in I better do something to recoup my karma! Down with the government! Freedom! Private choices always best choices, no exceptions! Karma please, fellow champions of liberty.

Yes, yes it is.
Unless you think the USA is going to hyper inflate any time soon, btc will never be worth 1,000,000 **ever**

Are you telling me that my money did not in fact disappear overnight? I'd love to have it back.

Because he does not understand how it is possible to use a service and not agree with every aspect of it.

You'll be able to book a sweet hotel room though. Granted, you could have just spent the money directly on the hotel room, but this way you can feel excited about your payment method.

This "journalist" doesn't agree with me so I'm going to put his title and profession in quotes to discredit him.

How am I supposed to trade bitcoins if not through a company that I don't own?
@_date: 2014-09-08 14:53:15
The implication that someone who supports central banking and financial stimulus is ignorant is absurd.
@_date: 2014-10-16 18:42:15
What a ridiculous reply. I made fun of the guy for defending poor services based on an overly ideological view of economics, and you replied with nonsense about the government in the economy. Try reading before replying with an irrelevant rant.

Oops my bitcoin bank "lost" 700 million and isn't obligated to repay any of it.

Gold is infinitely more useful than bitcoin because people can create things besides financial transactions with gold. Granted, bitcoin is far more useful as a transaction medium, but gold would have never been used for that if not for its intrinsic value. With bitcoin there is none of that. There is no value beyond how strongly people want the opportunity to trade with it. Currently, the outlook does not look very good.

You don't need to convince me of anything... Everyone in the world understands that gold has declined as a form of financial transaction, you're not special in that regard. The only thing I was suggesting was that the actual intrinsic potential use of gold is what allowed it to be used as a financial medium in the first place. Besides gold we have fiat money, which probably wont go anywhere because that is what militaries are paid in and what they will continue to be paid in for the foreseeable future. Bitcoin on the other hand has neither intrinsic value or global institutions that depend on it, nor any authorities that want to use it.
