Thanks, I forgot he won't get the message. Copied below.
I figure that if he's spamming it and is a possible scammer, then if I go first then the worst that could happen is that we just don't trade.  If he doesn't agree to the terms, then it's probably a scam and not worth the risk.  Thanks again for your help!

That's true that you can't know for sure if it's truly "dead" for good.  The same goes for fiat, Yap stone money, rice, etc.  (I'm not trying to single out just gold)
As far as I know, you are correct that this is the only time in history that all countries abandoned gold at once.  However, it's also the only time in history that they all moved to fiat.  It's also the only time in history that we've had such a connected world wide society that this type of coordination was even possible.
My point is simply that just because it's no longer used as a currency now, does not mean that it won't be returned to.  There's just no way of knowing for sure.  The fact that central banks still hold gold should tell you that they do not have full confidence in their fiat system.

For those that say deflation will kill bitcoin, simply ask them: "When?".
All good science should have a testable prediction.  What condition is sufficient to say that bitcoin is both dead and killed specifically by deflation?
Since the "when" for gold hasn't come yet, it's looking less and less likely that it ever will.

It appears that they were at a real restaurant location that happened to accept bitcoin.  It wasn't clear from your screenshot since Skye was in the way, [so I took a screenshot of the next shot in the scene.](  As you can see, the sign was purposely covered up, so sadly, this doesn't seem to be an endorsement like on The Good Wife or Almost Human.

When you send BTC, you are paying a miner a small fee for a service.  This service is considered taxable, but the tax is paid by the miner.  Just like when you employ someone and pay them a salary in BTC, they pay income tax but you pay nothing.  A miner gets his income (25 BTC + fees) and pays tax on that.
I think the fundamental issue here is the following:
Should paying a miner be considered as paying a salary (income tax) or paying for a service (sales tax)?  Currently from what I understand, it is more like the former.
(I do not give tax advice)

If I had to guess, I'd say that all of the clues were created by the same person, but I really don't know for sure.
I actually ran into the same capitalization issue as you for the music.  I saw that it was listed both ways, depending on the language, so I added it as one of my many things to test.
I actually brute forced the rymes clue.  I never thought to look at it more literally.  I also kept coming back to the 'H'.  Looking back it now seems a bit more simple.
I basically ordered each answer by my confidence level and just brute forced the ones I was least confident in.

 is fine, they seem reasonable.
I just checked and I think paypal has a 2.9% + $0.30 fee.
I propose the following:
1) For both your and my safety (to prevent scamming) we trade 0.25 BTC first and work our way up from there.
2) Since my account is older, and you seem to have very little reputation, you send BTC first, and then I will pay. (It would be to my disadvantage to scam you since we're dealing with small BTC increments)
3) I will publicly post my BTC address here so that Ilsensine and everyone on reddit can verify that you have sent the BTC.
4) We use preev.com as the price and we will "lock in" the rate by both agreeing to it.
5) We will split the paypal fee. (I will deduct 1.5% from the amount I send to you.)  For example, instead of sending $100 I will send you $98.5.  For simplicity, lets take the preev.com rate and multiply it by 0.985 and that is what the actual rate is that I will send.
6) I will wait for 1 confirmation on the blockchain.  This seems more than reasonable since I don't think it's fair to make you wait for the standard 6 for a small transaction.

Thanks for the clarification!
I don't agree that deflationary currency creates a disincentive to invest compared to an inflationary one.
* If there's a deflationary currency with 0% inflation, then you have an incentive to invest (relative to saving) if you believe you will make a &gt; 0% return.  Here, you are never willing to take a loss since the alternative is best.
* If there's an inflationary currency with a 2% inflation, then you have an incentive to invest (relative to saving) if you believe you will make &gt; -2% return.  Here, you are willing to take a 1% loss per year on your investment because it's better than a 2% loss.
0% and -2% only establish the floor of your required return.  They don't establish the ceiling.  In the end, an investor in both scenarios will always prefer to invest in what has the highest expected return (regardless of the currency).
The only difference is that the inflationary investor would be willing to put his wealth into a company that loses wealth (but at a lower rate than inflation), while the deflationary investor would only be willing to put his wealth into a company that does not lose wealth.
One could argue that inflation encourages malinvestment by giving an incentive to spending money on a slow "stock horse" only because that horse is faster than the "currency horse".  Either way, the horse is making them lose wealth, just at a different rate.
Great talk.  It's always a pleasure discussing economics with rational thinkers instead of just trolls.

When you do a DNS lookup, it's fast because you're actually only contacting one server with a cached result.  When you create a DNS entry, it can take a day for it to be propagated in the network.
You can actually send from Wallet A -&gt; B -&gt; C within seconds.  All 3 transactions will be broadcast to the network and all 3 may appear in the next block.

Did they give you any type of authentication?  I never talk to any company over the phone that I did not initiate.  In the future I highly suggest that you ask for a publicly available callback number to make sure you really are talking to Paypal.
Before you answered their questions, did you ask WHY they wanted to know?  I'm also very curious why they'd contact you.
I've never heard of anything like this, but if it really was Paypal, I'm not sure what to think.  My best guess is that the seller had other complaints and they were merely investigating if he committed fraud in the past.

That is correct that it was abandoned and returned to many times throughout history.  My point is that if it were truly "dead" then it would not keep going through that cycle.  It would simply be abandoned and never returned to.
What exactly do you mean by the price of gold changed?  Price is relative (typically to a standard currency) and I'm describing a situation when gold itself was the currency.  This is equivalent to saying that the price of the dollar significantly changed.  Are you implying that the purchasing power of gold significantly changed, and if so can you say relative to what?

@_date: 2014-04-03 15:26:53
Ah, this is an excellent question!  This is one of those mind blowing things that makes people so excited about bitcoin!
Bitcoin requires a private and a public key.  The private key is used to generate the public key.  So if you tell me the private key, I can tell you the corresponding public key easily.  If you tell me the public key, then I can not tell you the private key easily.
Imagine a function that takes a private key as input and spits out a public key as output.
When you generate a private key, it's done completely offline.  You use the function described above to find the corresponding public key.  You simply never reveal the private key, but you do reveal the public key.
I can then send you BTC using that public key without you ever even touching the internet!  If you want to *spend* that BTC, however, then you need to sign a transaction using your private key (this is also done offline).  Finally you need to broadcast to the world this transaction (this is the only part that is necessary to be done online).
Edit: Since offline wallets don't connect to the blockchain, this DOES mean that two people can coincidentally get the same private key.  However, the probability for an accidental collision is extremely low.

I could be wrong, but as far as I know, the heartbleed bug only lets an attacker view part of a SSL connection.  Here, the attacker could see that you downloaded the paper wallet (which I assume is bitaddress?) but that's about it.  As far as I know, they can't modify the data, so you should be fine.
If you DO want to worry, then assume any account you've ever logged into has a compromised password.  This means you should change your password on every website you've visited while this bug was active (assuming that the bug has been fixed already on those sites).

This myth is starting to get old.  Let's do a simple thought experiment.
Let's say we have some currency that's called Dlog.  Dlog is in a limited supply and exchanged for goods and services.  People would never be able to use this Dlog for thousands of years, right?  The economy would collapse and civilization would come to an end!
Fortunately the deflationary argument against BTC can easily be debunked by simply pointing to a real life example.  Dlog = gold.  It's been used for thousands of years and people are still alive.

Well consider it a huge success.  You not only helped me better understand brain wallets, but because of this game, my friend has now been introduced to bitcoin.  He's already starting to go through the "this is amazing how fast you can send money, but who controls bitcoin?" phase.
I completely agree with you about brain wallets.  It's funny how their weakness as a personal wallet makes them ideal for public games like this.  I wonder if it's even possible to make a game completely based on the blockchain by using BIP38 addresses (to remove bots from taking the coins instead of game contestants).  Maybe the new 40 bytes of data could even be used to store clues!

Yup, shows over folks, nothing to see here!
Exactly.  If it IS a bubble, then it's not harming anyone except those who understood the risks going in.  Investors (especially the libertarian types in this crowd) know that they take full responsibility for their gains and losses.  They don't need (or want) a nanny state prohibiting them from using a currency "for their own good".
When Prof Bitcorn said it was a bubble and Rep Mulvaney said "so what", I had the biggest grin on my face.  Finally a guy in power who gets it.

They warn us about stocks, gambling, smoking, etc.  But I do agree that it's very annoying and even sometimes an insult to our intelligence.
The real question is, do they warn us about the US dollar inflation, treasury bonds, other municipal bonds, state provided services like insurance, state provided pensions, or even interest at the bank?  Each of these are risky even if they are claimed to be a sure thing (just ask Cyprus or Detroit!).
I'm not sure what the criteria they use to warn us is.  Either it's investments that they don't like, or it's investments that have a certain threshold of perceived risk.  As long as they don't *prevent* me from being able to use these "risky" services, then it's simply an annoyance that I'm willing to tolerate.
There's *no such thing* as a risk free investment.  In theory any investment could come with a warning... but they don't... because it's common sense.
When the nanny state (or individuals for that matter) warn me of something like this, I like to nod and say "Thanks, I completely and fully understand all of the risks" before buying the risky item in front of them with a grin on my face.
@_date: 2014-04-03 15:21:16
Allow me to rephrase.  I should not say it's "bad" for the goose, but rather simply "worse".  The goose can still benefit, but if the goose puts their wealth into a deflationary asset instead of inflationary money, then they are no longer taking the inflationary cost, while still receiving the benefit.  The reason why deflationary commodities/currencies seem attractive to many is due to this incentive.
Side question: If the goose puts their wealth in bonds, stocks, etc. then how is that related to what money they're using?  The same can be done in a gold or bitcoin economy.  The stock market won't cease to exist if people use bitcoin.  Credit is still possible with deflationary currency.

I agree with most of what you said.  The only technical part that I'd argue is that a token backed 100% by gold has identical economic effects as gold, but if the gold-to-currency holdings change, then it's no longer really a gold standard.
It's a bit of a strawman argument to point out the problems with a gold currency by describing the effects of using a changing gold-to-currency ratio.  If it's not 100%, then it's a different currency system.
I'm not trying to state that gold is perfect.  (Hell I'm in the bitcoin subreddit for a reason!)  I just think 1) it is not completely dead yet and 2) deflationary currency is not the end of the world.

I won't debate about what amount of inflation is better what which specific economy because I'm not an expert and I don't know what about is "best".  If it means a better economy and that I will benefit, then yes I would love to have 1-2% inflation in the economy... for everyone except for me.  This way I can benefit without losing 1-2% per year.
I always wonder though one critical thing and if you are pro inflation, I really hope you can help me better understand this.  Please let meknow where my logic fails if it does:
1. Inflation is bad for the goose (the individual person) but good for the gander (the overall economy)
2. Using economic game theory, there is therefore an incentive for the individual person to put their wealth into something non inflationary even at the cost of the economy as a whole.
3. Unless it is forced upon the individuals that they must use the inflationary currency and slowly lose their wealth for the good of the whole, they will all switch to a deflationary currency (assuming that they are rational actors)
4. What is "best" does not actually matter.
This feels very much like trying to coordinate on Basically, lets assume that I agree that it's better for the collective to have inflation.  I'd simply argue, "so?".  It's better for everyone to have inflation except for me if I'm greedy.

You seem to have missed the point... bitcoin is inherently cool so there's absolutely no reason to lie.
People don't want to be *told* why bitcoin is cool, they want to see it in action.
You want to show your friends how cool it is?  Easy as hell.
Get two android phones with blockchain.info installed.  "Hey, here's that money for pizza I owed you" *beep* You got BTC bro.  **Fast and easy**
Get a paper wallet from bitaddress.org already printed out for them.  Rip it in half in front of them.  Give them the private key.  Tell them to hide this tiny piece of paper in the house.  Take out your phone and send them some BTC.  Explain to them that there's no way for you to get your money back without them voluntarily giving it to you. **Control over your money**
Fire up brainwallet.org and tell them to pick a super secret (and super strong) password and type it in.  We'll skip BIP38 for now, they're not ready yet.  Ask if they memorized their password.  When they say yes, ask them to show you where that paper was they hid.  Tell them that a robber/evil authority could have put a gun to their head to ask them where it is.  Now send some BTC to their brainwallet.  Ask them to show you where they hid the private key now.  Tell them how there is nothing physical to even hide, yet they still have control over their money. **Value is just an idea**
Etc, etc.  There's so many ways you can introduce them to this and blow their mind.  They do gain powers similar to invisibility --plausible deniability-- and telepathy --sending money from their mind-- but there's no reason to lie to them when bitcoin is already freaking amazing.

From what I remember (I was young at the time), people didn't actively hate on it with a passion the way people do with bitcoin, however they often did not see the practicality or the need for it.
Once people became convinced that it was necessary, the next hurdle (which in my opinion was harder to overcome than the first) was getting people to have easy access to the technology to use it.  Computers were a luxury back then as was internet access.
Today I think we are witnessing the opposite.  The technological infrastructure has become commonplace (many people have a cellphone), but the misunderstandings and skepticism are bigger issues.

This really should be the argument regarding regulation of ATMs and exchanges.  If the transaction is less than $10,000 then the community should argue that there need not be KYC laws.

Correct, you shouldn't use a 3rd party wallet that has access to your private keys.  is talking about a program that uses a non random number to generate your keys.  This non random number they would also know and would therefore be able to reconstruct your private keys without ever even touching your computer.  (Obligatory xkcd 
If you create a paper wallet by simply printing it, then yes you are still vulnerable.  It needs to be created "offline".  This means for best paranoid practices, get a computer and boot it with a linux live cd.  This computer should have an "air gap" meaning that there's no way to contact the outside world including wireless communications (no bluetooth, no ethernet, no wifi, etc.).  Use a copy of trusted open source wallet software to generate the public/private pair.  Print this out using a printer not connected to a network or simply write it down.

At the risk of downvotes... OP has a point (since I assume it was sarcasm).  Trading A for B for C for D does not mean you really traded A for D.
Even Gyft is still too indirect for me.  I want a store to accept it *directly*.  With Gyft, you're not purchasing a TV with BTC.  You're purchasing a gift card that you can use to purchase a TV with.
Fewer indirect transactions mean less middlemen which in turn means lower fees.  It is also less hoops to jump through as a customer.
Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love Bitcoin.  I just don't believe that we can claim that a merchant accepts it until they actually accept it directly.  I think the day will come, but we're just not there *yet*.

This clip is priceless too :D
I think this guy reads and is jealous.
After he says it's a bubble, Rep Mulvaney says "so what?"  It's a tiny part of the economy so why would it matter.  Prof Bitcorn has a vendetta against Bitcoin, no doubt about it.  I can't find it, but I think at some point he said that he was watching Bitcoin since it was 13 cents.  If this is the case, I think we know why he's pissed off so much.  He wants to see it fail in order to validate his lack of buying into it.  Otherwise he will live his life in regret.  He's mentally doubled down on that sentiment.

The funny part is that everyone who shouts that deflationary currency is bad never said how much inflation is good.  If they do, they rarely give a scientific reasoning behind the exact arbitrary number.
If a currency is inflationary by 10% per year or 0.00001% per year, it's still inflationary.  Clearly 0.00001% will probably have an unnoticeable difference to a deflationary currency.
Want to convince people that after 2140 that bitcoin is not going to implode due to deflation?  Easy.  Make 0.00001% inflation per year.
tl;dr - Pro inflation people don't usually seem to realize that there's not a major net economic difference between having inflation at exactly 0% vs having it approach an asymptotic 0% bound.  The former is technically deflationary, while the latter is technically inflationary.
@_date: 2014-04-08 17:48:08
I agree that it is not "used" as property, but the same could be said for items that are bartered.
The reality is that the difference between a currency and property is just how it's used.  If tomorrow people used  pencils as currency, we'd be having the same discussion.  It's a completely subjective definition that the government is trying to put into an objective form in order to tax.
I'd have no problem with a hybrid category.  To be honest, I really don't care what people call it.  A rose by any other name would smell as sweet.  I care not what people call it, but rather how they regulate it.
In the end, the issue arises due to the government requiring people pay taxes in different ways simply based on how something is used.

In any other community, I'd probably believe this story.  In the BTC community, however, past experience tells me that it's very possible he simply stole the money and fled the country.  The story about spending all of the venture capital and receiving death threats could just be a fabricated story to cover up.

Not many people trade with gold compared to last century, that is true.  However, I specifically asked what condition defines the death of a currency.
You seem to imply that the lack of use of a currency defines its death.  This is a reasonable definition.  You say in your other post that gold "was abandoned (and returned) many, many times throughout history".  Does this mean that gold died and then came back to life?  If so, was it *really* actually dead?  Let's define death as something permanent, otherwise it's just in a cycle.
Edit: Upvoting you to cancel out someone's downvote.  While I disagree with what you say, I strongly believe in encouraging opposing views in order to reach the truth.  Bitcoin itself wouldn't be here today if Satoshi listened to the naysayers.  I really wish people would stop downvoting simply because they disagree.

I realize that if a court orders you to do something, then in the end you must do it or else you face a consequence.  So if a court orders you to give up your passwords, then you either give them up or you go to prison.
You *can* circumvent the seizure of funds, but it has a cost of imprisonment for not complying. (When I say "can" I mean you're strictly able to, not necessarily allowed to.)
I'm not asking how to bypass a court ruling once they make a decision.  I'm simply asking if the decision that a court makes when they require someone to submit a password will legally fall under the 5th amendment.

If created offline, the blockchain does not know about it.  The blockchain only first knows about your public key when you receive a payment.  Until that happens, the blockchain does not know your address even exists.


To get money *into* your wallet, you need to tell your public key to the person who wants to give you money.  Then *they* would need to sign a transaction with their own private key and they would broadcast this to the internet.  So to receive money, you need no internet access, but the payer does.
To get money *out of* your wallet, you need to sign a transaction and send the transaction through the internet.


You can create the wallet offline, but if nobody knows your public key, then you will never be able to receive BTC.


Correct.  However, the security comes from the fact that your private/public keys can be created offline, then ONLY your public key is exposed.  This leaves your private key very secure.
You can create your public/private keys offline.
To *send* BTC you *do* need to touch the blockchain.
To *receive* BTC you *do not* need to touch the blockchain.

* Bitcoin is treated as property.
* It will be taxed no different than property.
* Bitcoin ATM that dispense bitcoin are treated like a vending machine.
* Localbitcoins type of transactions are legal.
* Any transaction involving $10,000+ needs to be reported just the same as they are today.
* Verifying a persons identity is not necessary unless their account transacts in over $10,000.
* Bitcoin ATMs, exchanges, person to person transactions, and business sales (like overstock) are legal and require no verification unless above the $10,000 threshold.
(Of course these are just some rough bullet points, but the basics all boil down to no verification for small transactions.  It's a start, but it's more than reasonable in my opinion and I'm willing to bet that the majority of does not like AML/KYC at all, but they would be willing to make this compromise.)

I misspelled his name in a comment, but I actually checked the spelling by looking at the OP.
Misspellings are viral, unfortunately.
Also, "buffet" is a word that spellcheck often will suggest if you try to write his name.  I think most misspellings are just simply due to that.

I say the young bitcoiners should regulate the old bankers instead... You know... for their own good.
I feel like these "protections" are being forced on a group of people who started using a currency for sole purpose of avoiding such "protections".  Maybe instead they can simply have 2 types of business transactions: regulated and unregulated.  At least give people the option to opt-out and instead let the free market decide which approach wins.

This is so painful to read through.  These bitcoin ATMs are destroying the image of bitcoin.  People have a hard enough time realizing that bitcoin has no company behind it.  It's almost as if the government put these terrible restrictions on the ATMs simply because it was the easiest way to destroy the privacy that is inherent to bitcoin.

Yea... The inconsistent definitions give them a catch-22 situation which will unfortunately always be used against, not for BTC users.

I *might* share the code, but I would want to heavily clean it up first - I am too self conscious about my embarrassingly terrible coding practices.  Either way, it really isn't anything special.  There's already brute force private key programs that exist that are much better than mine anyway (multithreaded or even gpu based probably).  I only wrote it because I wanted to get my hands a little dirty with some Bitcoin libraries.

Thanks for letting me know about this!
I find it amusing how for some reason bitcoin makes these guys finally ask themselves "what is money" and "what's the difference between money and a commodity".  Bitcoin seems to have caused a philosophical debate among regulators about the concepts of money and value.
@_date: 2014-04-02 18:08:16
Ok, asking for payment first is probably safer.
I don't see where he's lying, however.  It's very possible that it's a scam, but if I demand payment first, then I can't get scammed.
I know I'm an honest guy, but obviously nobody can trust anyone on the internet sadly.

Jeeze, I'm sorry if I hit some kind of nerve... It's only been 2 days.
I'm not even sure what me being a "sock puppet" would even accomplish.  I agree that in theory I could be working with purestvfx, but what would be the point?  Just to troll users with an unsolvable quiz?  Even if I post the solution, you would still have no way of knowing if I were working with purestvfx or not.  (That being said, I was not... assuming that my word carries any weight.)
The best "proof" I can give is my post history.  You'll see that I've solved another Bitcoin puzzle from a completely different user.  I simply enjoy solving puzzles (BTC related or not).
said they would post the solutions on weekends, so I assumed they will take care of it.  I'd be more than happy to post it, I just figured that
1. some people might not want spoilers or
2. purestvfx did not want it posted until the weekend
I will post the private key, but I won't post the explanations since some of them I don't actually know (I had to brute force them).  Many of the solutions are probably obvious anyway once the character is known.  If you have any questions on specific questions, I'll try my best.

Yea, surprisingly I got it before your hint.  I got stuck on that clue for a while trying various things since it's a common name, but I eventually got some help from a friend.  He was able to figure it out (not me), so I helped him set up a paper bitcoin wallet and showed him how to transfer it directly to himself!

I really wish I saved my answers now...
I almost brute forced it, but after searching for a while, I did manage to find it.  Sadly, I don't remember anymore and I can't seem to find it again.
I *think* it may have been a foreign film, possibly french.  I think that the image was taken from a poster/still with other children characters next to him.  (The title may have started with a P, but I could be mistaken)
I can't even remember what I searched for that eventually found it.  I had to have tried hundreds of different things.
This was the hardest one for me to find... so hard I can't seem to even find it twice.
My memory is so bad due to so many failed attempts at this clue, that it's probably better to just wait for the real answer to be posted. :P
@_date: 2014-04-08 16:03:40
I'm no expert, so please correct me if I'm wrong.
This sounds possible, but not plausible.  The heartbleed bug in theory would allow an attacker to read part of the protected memory of a server.  In theory, this seems like it's possible to break into BTCJam.
However I doubt the plausibility for very simple and practical reasons.  Have any other websites confirmed this attack actually being used on them?  Maybe I just missed it, but I've yet to hear about a site actually being compromised *yet*.  Of course BTC related sites will be a target, but so will thousands of others that deal with finances.
There's a rich history of BTC thefts being blamed on bugs (sheep marketplace, possibly mtgox, etc.) so I don't think it should be assumed to be this bug just yet.
@_date: 2014-04-03 02:13:22
Yup.  It's already been debunked to death, yet he still perpetuates this lie.
@_date: 2014-04-29 13:44:37
Completely understandable.  (The website btw can actually be downloaded and run completely offline too.)
Either way, it doesn't sound like your keys are in WiF format.  Do you remember the process you used to get the private key backup?
I'd suggest downloading the software from bitaddress.org located here  by clicking "Download ZIP".
For extra security, you can run this completely offline to make sure that nobody can steal your keys.  (You can run a livecd and turn off all wifi cards, ethernet, etc.)
Unzip the contents and open "bitaddress.org.html" in a web browser to run the app.  Click on "Wallet Details" on the top and simply enter the private key there.  I personally like this site since it allows lots of formats: WIF, WIFC, HEX, B64, B6, MINI, BIP38
@_date: 2014-04-04 13:58:28
Unfortunately, your'e right.  Every time one of these exchanges breaks news, the price drops.  I guess it's not already built into the market yet.
@_date: 2014-04-29 18:03:54
While I agree with your 2nd situation, I still have to disagree with the 1st.
I can easily hold someone else's BIP38 encrypted key without knowing the password.  I actually did!  Another reddit user had a contest in which people had to solve a puzzle to find a BIP38 key.  I did not know the password at the time, but I still held the wallet.  Another time, someone posted their encrypted wallet and I simply tried to break in to test how they work (but obviously I couldn't guess the password).
Aren't these two situations proof that simply holding a public key or an encrypted wallet not enough to prove you have access?  I think plausible deniability, as mentioned, should (in theory) be enough to not incriminate yourself.
No matter what laws the government were to throw at me, no matter what I was charged with, and no matter how much "rubber-hose cryptanalysis" was used, I would still never be able to give them the private key because I really did not know it.

Agreed, we need to have an open discussion about this.  I personally don't like AML/KYC at all and think they should be scrapped 100%, but I know realistically this won't happen.  I think the best strategy is to simply "compromise" and allow absolutely NO AML/KYC regulations on accounts until they hit $10,000 or more.  Would this not nicely solve the alleged problem and make more bitcoin users happy at the same time?
Ideally, I'd prefer bitcoin treated as property.  You can use existing barter laws to cover it with no issue.  Yes it's revolutionary, but it really does fit into the barter laws already without any extra regulations required.  MSB licences for bitcoin are absurd.
@_date: 2014-04-29 18:21:15
That is also true.  It's a very good point that I did not actually consider.  I agree it's similar to tying a person to an IP, except it seems a little more "personal" to me.  I would share a jacket (an IP address) but I wouldn't share underwear (a private key).
If the BTC address was involved in a crime (that I did not commit) and I had the private key, then why was I actually sharing a key in the first place?
There are already laws on the books that make it illegal to obtain ill-gotten gains.  If I am the recipient of a stolen VCR, I still am required by law to surrender it.  If I knew it was stolen, then I've committed a crime, but if I did not know, then I just am required to surrender the property.  One could argue that these laws would apply similarly here as well.
(I'm not saying these laws are "fair" or "just" by any means.  I'm only saying that they exist and are possibly applicable.)
@_date: 2014-04-29 18:39:58
Ok, I do agree that if they can plausibly link you to it, then they know you probably have the key.  (For simplicity, I'll ignore for the moment that you could have actually sent the coins to someone else, lost the key, or even had them stolen from you.)
However, that doesn't really work if CoinJoin, Zerocoin, or one of the many other similar privacy services are used.  Would the 5th apply if they can't plausibly link the address to you?
I think this entire concept of compelling one to present information is fascinating since there really is no way to truly know if the person actually knows (or even remembers) the information.  Instead it can only be inferred that they know information.
@_date: 2014-04-04 17:39:50
Depending on when she may need to cash out, the learning curve may be much much lower.  In the future we may be able to just bring a private key to a bank and get cash, who knows.
Don't forget that there's nothing worse than her rushing to "cash in" since we all know that mistakes can very easily be made by inexperienced users.  It may even be worth it for her to higher someone you personally trust to broker the transaction for her.
The inner security geek in me hates saying this, but if you have a coinbase account, you could also always just provide her with the password.
Finally, she could always spend the time and learn more about bitcoin, but this obviously may not be anything she desires to do so it should not be forced upon her.
Regardless of what you do, you should tell her exactly how many BTC you have and how she can find out their current value (so she does not get ripped off in the future).  Also teach her the basics of security.  "Don't show this piece of paper to anyone because if they simply see it, they stole it."

I answered *almost* all of the questions, but yes I did write a custom brute force program for the remainder.  It's a single threaded CPU based program, so it isn't really feasible if more than a few answers are not known.
The 3rd section was by far the hardest for me and I almost gave up trying to solve it!

It is vulnerable regardless of the wallet being open or not.
Your wallet file is vulnerable to be *taken* while the pc is turned on and connected to the internet, but once taken, the theif can steal your money any time afterwords regardless of the state of your pc.
It is both less and more vulnerable than we make it out to be.  More malware tends to be created for windows than other OSs which is why it is seen as a larger risk.
You can use typical virus protection software, but this will not protect you from everything.  A 0-day exploit, for example, could mean no matter what software protections you take, you will not be protected.
**Not asked, but I'm obligated to mention: The BEST way to keep your wallet safe is to use a paper wallet.**
