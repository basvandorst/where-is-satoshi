Hi, responding here in hopes of visibility. I use AirBitz. From everything I understand it is a decentralized personal wallet, but I haven't seen any posts about it. Am I safe?

Omfg this is amazing, I laughed so hard!

What exactly are the factors contributing to this plateau? Do we know? Any guesses?
Seems...suspicious to me that there is all this news about more and more adoption, and the lightning network making everyday use of bitcoin possible, yet the price remains stagnant. It's like someone is able to intentionally stall the rush in order for their pieces to move around.

Apparently some emails that he sent a few days before his death said that he believed he was under FBI surveillance.

I'm a newb to Bitcoin (following since January this year?) Well, I heard about Bitcoin of course long before then but only recently have I started investing in it. This is my first post in this sub.
I use Coinbase to buy BC, then I transfer it to my Airbitz wallet. I actually just had a chunk sitting in Coinbase for a while until I learned what a wallet was. Airbitz grabbed my attention with its client-side encryption and decentralized model.
To be honest Bitcoin is a nebulous topic even though I read about it regularly now. I find myself asking these questions all the time: How is Coinbase not a wallet? Why don't people like it? What is a pumper? What good is BC if there is only a finite amount? Who has the largest swathes of BC in their possession and what do they plan to do with it?
My interest for investing in BC is exactly that: to invest. I consider it a commodity, not a currency.

Fuck banks, put your money into a credit union. Those fucking banks sabotaged the entire economy, got away with it, and do shady shit every year to their customers. They do not care about you or your financial safe keeping; banks are for-profit institutions, credit unions are non-profit. 
You will receive higher interest on savings accounts at a credit union, and lower interest on loans, and generally better customer service too.
Fuck banks. Put your money into a credit union tomorrow.

Simple.com is backed by Chase. Go with a credit union.

Thank you very much! I guess I misunderstood the idea of Airbitz being "decentralized," I thought it meant that the BTC "lives" on the phone. I'm afraid I have more questions now -- They say that you can access your wallet and use your BTC even if their servers are down? I also thought it meant that I would be avoiding coindesk-esque issues where you could be scammed out of your coins? Is that not the case?

Holy crap, an Airbitz employee responded to this.
I feel much better with this knowledge, thank you for taking the time to write this. I chose Airbitz based on their mission statement of security being built into the model itself, the last thing I want is my BTC stolen from me. This response further cements the trust that I have in your wallet app, so thank you.
Combined with u/Cryptoedge 's response, I better understand how my coins and information remains safe on my phone -- the explanation of the lockboxes and keys helped, thank you!

What? Does "Leftist" in the blockchain world mean something entirely different than left and right political views? 
Philosophically, a person with "left" leanings is going to support "greater good" ideals, pacifism, social programs, tolerance, distribution of wealth...all things aimed at promoting greater welfare for the greatest amount of people possible. It comes from Utilitarianism, a philosophy that John Stuart Mill argued and became famous for. That's the "left" that I know.

Every week on this sub I read about some service or establishment now accepting bitcoin - it seems like bitcoin *is* being adopted. So what is the problem? As one new establishment adopts, another drops?
I also see news about how Money and Sons financial firm is going to invest in crypto, or Get Rich stock exchange is entering bitcoin. Yet the price doesn't go up.
My tinfoil hat says there's a large scale stalling effort taking place that's keeping the price down while political and financial interests enter the market; organizations like the IMF hating on bitcoin is all the proof you need that the financial establishment hates the idea of decentralized currency. The more you spend the more bitcoin potentially enters the wallets of organizations who will be quick to do nothing with it.
Personally I am being patient. If adoption really is increasing then it's only a matter of time.

Yeah or we can get all the money that the Panama Papers revealed to be just hanging out and use that to pay the debt since it's basically the same amount.
We could also tone down the amount of money that we give to the Pentagon considering that it  can't account for $22 *trillion* dollars. Can you imagine being given so much tax payer money that you can get away with "losing" $22 trillion?

A business that stores physical currency and invests it in order to turn a profit that somehow fails has proven that it can't carry out the core of its business model.
It's practically an oxymoron that a business that takes the public's money is out of money.

And to go with that -- why should the populace believe that these spy programs are even helping us? The Orlando gay club shooter was on the FBI watchlist but he was still able to purchase a gun. Isn't he the prime example of who they should be watching? I'm sure there are countless other examples of a flagged individual who seems to evade the watchful eye of Big Brother. 
You have to wonder if an incident like Omar Mateen was -- to an extent -- allowed to happen so that elites could argue for gun control, a policy that would not hurt their perpetual Orwellian agenda. For all of the actions and rampant cronyism of Congress it's hard to believe that gun control is for "our protection," when their everyday actions seem to say that they don't give a fuck about the little guys at all. No, I think the argument for gun control is for *their* protection, because if you disarm a populace you can more easily control that populace.
These spy programs seem more and more to not keep us safe from terrorists, but rather to keep them safe from dissenters and real journalists who practice the art of investigation. If they have all of the information then they can blackmail anyone.

I'm still ahead in my investment so the dip doesn't worry me much. What it means for me is that it's a good time to buy. 
@_date: 2018-03-18 19:22:49
Time to buy! 
@_date: 2018-02-23 04:44:24
It's still not live for a majority of users. Sounds like it's state specific with no exact date when it'll release to everyone. 
@_date: 2018-07-22 17:36:10
I've been buying during this entire dip. I'm ready.

R/investing has no respect for bitcoin, they think Warren Buffet's prediction that crypto is just a fad will turn out true. In their mind crypto is too easy with no real sweat investment in terms of research. I don't agree that bitcoin will fail but I can't blame them for their perspective either.

I was buying all January, February, and March.

Lol 60 minutes spent time on this? It's like the ultimate tragedy for blue-blooded America - *almost* becoming a millionaire.
"Don't buy bitcoin, citizens, for if you do your status as a temporarily displaced millionaire will never be wiped away."

Someone who cares not about the history of a thing has no business turning said thing into their hobby.
