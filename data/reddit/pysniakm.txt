WIth my 2012 WMF coffee machine, according to its counter each cup of coffe was 4000 Euro, it somehow makes it taste better though.

Check out my post and comment history then. I'm a former cc believer turned fierce critic of cc as a scam and I use facts. You sir are a cultist.
@_date: 2019-11-06 09:28:12
Go on, tell us about the genuine world use scenarios and how a deflationary currency can even work in real world. We both know it's a speculative token except you are holding the bags and are emotionally invested. Your ponzi is ran by the Chinese and is contributing to climate change.
I love how they downvote &amp; not provide any genuine facts.
@_date: 2019-11-08 09:59:49
So naive, so foolish. Nations will decide to use btc and in the process making selected few hoarders mega rich. What are you people smoking? Btc is a deflationary speculative token with 70+% hashpower centralized in China. Open your eyes. Your life will become simple again when you realize it is a scam.
@_date: 2019-11-09 10:27:14
Bitcoin neckbeards will not pass on using other peoples dire straits to shill their ponzi. Pathetic.
@_date: 2019-11-08 12:04:58
Those regulations exist to prevent fraud and tax evasion. This indeed is the bitcoins nemesis, I agree....
@_date: 2019-11-05 11:14:39
AML. This is nothing new and to be expected. If your ponzi is soo good why is nobody except criminals and pedos and neckbeards using it then?
@_date: 2019-11-06 11:22:15
You still havent answered how a deflationary cc can be used in real world as means of payment. I'm willing to forget for a moment that this is a scam with unfortunate victims and speculators propping it up and listen..
@_date: 2019-11-08 10:11:00
Growing desperate and trying to fool people into thinking it has any relevance?
@_date: 2019-08-28 19:20:45
You filthy shorter, was it you who crashed the market. Have you no heart.
@_date: 2019-08-28 18:56:13
It's good for bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-08-29 07:55:11
Yeah it's comedy gold. Even those fake gold bars have some small intrinsic value to them. It's pretty, I would buy one (stamped as fake naturally). At least it wouldn't be at risk of double spend, roll back, 51%, devs changing 1 line of code to introduce inflation or half of it disappearing overnight?
@_date: 2019-10-20 10:13:30
Those are very inconvenient truths for BTC shills, expect a lot of hate..
@_date: 2019-08-07 16:51:01
Shhh, you will upset the moonboys
@_date: 2019-08-28 21:41:47
I think it will have to go below 6k for institutions to buy _again_ (who do you think dumped in last few weeks)
@_date: 2019-08-22 17:46:51
BTC is not for profit?
@_date: 2019-08-11 14:22:53
Not so smart, some retailers will refuse it. 
It should say: buy bitcoin to make a small group of speculators rich when they dump, rinse and repeat.:)))
@_date: 2019-08-28 21:50:52
And all this goodness can be yours if you have the filthy fiat to spare

It's because you need a nuclear power plant next to each retailer who &lt;s&gt; adopted &lt;/s&gt; bitcoin payments to satisfy the 607kWh/transaction footprint.
@_date: 2019-08-22 21:56:26
You are being quite generous with claims of democracy when in fact what was a good idea was turned into quite a centralized ledger with energy footprint of 607kWh per TX confirmation of which there is what, 4-7 TPS? Clearly the whole venture is for profit and frankly IMO the whole setup stinks; what was technically an interesting idea has turned into a ponzi as of late with early hodlers preaching for new ATHs and newcomers ending up sorry. I used to be a serious altcoiner and I would even preach like you just have but this year's events opened my eyes. I preach caution. This project got out of control and was never designed to become a payment medium (I know about LN but this is also a flop).

Well said, nothing to add on my side. Cheers

Banks were invented to enable the concept of money to work and economies, trade and civilisations to exist. what sort of a retard view is this? It's lamentable that btc neckbeards promote such backward and shortsighted views but then again I have little sympathy for this cult.
@_date: 2019-10-13 13:37:55
Tick tock :)
@_date: 2019-10-20 10:47:29
IMO the cap will go because (and especially after the halving - and see what happened to LTC by the way) miners cant be expected to rely on fees to make profit, and if they did have to, then fees would go up, causing further decline in price or adoption. Also, why not, whales and exchanges do whatever they please anyway?
@_date: 2019-10-13 15:22:23
Just be careful with your ponzi, whales and suits milking the naive
@_date: 2019-08-29 08:05:50
I meant the OPs title was comedy gold.
@_date: 2019-10-20 10:27:27
Well you called it, most of both btc mining and ownership is centralized. The 21M cap is something that can be changed by altering a few lines of code once the consensus is resched (and it will, see the above re centralization). It's a vehicle for extracting money out of the naive.
@_date: 2019-10-19 21:15:16
Sooo it's an investment vehicle/scheme, not a currency?
And how does that scale with gold price now vs december 2017?
@_date: 2019-09-24 20:47:14
Not the best place to ask for unbiased investment advice you know
@_date: 2019-09-25 20:41:35

@_date: 2019-09-25 20:38:04
I read reports of it already, posted about it even. You are speculating that some entity intentionally crashed the market to buy cheap coins, I've seen that line so many times. No, its just market doing the market thing and whales making money off btc cultists.
@_date: 2019-09-24 20:04:02
Are you implying that a centralized asset was somehow a cure for the centralized world?
@_date: 2019-09-25 20:46:57
Its not that difficult to comprehend if you remember that the Chinese/bitmain control 80% of the pooled hashrate. Where technically mining is not lega so maybe some major miner outfit got busted. We won't know because its not a transparent market. Just be happy it wasnt 51%ed during that time.
@_date: 2019-09-22 15:34:10
It is time to short when comments like this pop up
@_date: 2019-09-24 17:53:10
It's 21 until majority miners decide to back up a change that would allow a higher cap. Just a tinyy minor code change by a handful of custodian coders.

Or, the market corrected after libra and bakkt fomos from months ago? Why is it that every time it starts to crash someone says its a manipulation but when its shooting up like stupid on printed tethers its oRgaNic growth to the moon. It will dive deeper, watch it.
