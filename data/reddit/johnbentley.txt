I've never bought bitcoins because:
* I wanted to setup my environment to be properly secure, from first principles. By that I mean: using deterministic wallets generated by a seed by Electrum; Using n of m secret sharing to secure my seed; Using Electrum on Tails loaded onto a USB stick; Signing bitcoin transfers "Off-line" - using said USB stick; Etc. That entailed *not* using something like Trezor.
* I wanted to define that system in a central place, like a wiki, for benefit of other users and to subject the procedure to scrutiny and updating by the many others who will have a better handle on what's going on.
* I got stuck at loading the right printer drivers for my printer, onto Tails.
* This "Buy Bitcoins" task is low on my to do list and so I haven't gotten round to attending to it.
So I have not gotten as far as you have: the attempt at buying bitcoins with fiat.
However, I do know that there are four basic means of acquiring bitcoins:
1. Use a bitcoin exchange directly to buy bitcoins with a credit card or paypal account.
2. Use a bitcoin exchange to supply you with their account number, into which you could transfer cash by walking into any bank and making a cash deposit into that account number.
3. Get people to give you bitcoins (e.g. by providing a good or service).
4. Buy bitcoins directly from someone, face to face, with cash.
I don't know the current state of play but I believe methods 1 and 2 have always been hit and miss when it comes to providing ID, with most scenarios requiring your ID. On the assumption that 3 is not readily available to you that leaves 4. And the website to effect that has generally been taken to be  
That is, use that site to search for a person under "Buy bitcoins with cash near [my location]" and arranged to meet them face to face. That method has all the associated risks with doing transactions with anonymous strangers on the street (and you need to watch out specifically for the scam of those asking for ID, only to steal your identity). But for low amounts of bitcoin, and if you just don't reveal any personal details, this should be a low risk proposition.
Whether or not any of that constitutes a continued pain in the arse, is for you to judge. But I'd be surprised if there was a pain free route to bitcoins. Perhaps someone better informed can surprise us both.


The idea would be that you'd store, say, $USD50 worth of bitcoin "hotly" on your internet connected desktop. An amount you could afford to lose through hacking. Kim Dotcom presumably provides a ready means to draw down on that amount as you go. So you'd buy the $USD50 worth of bitcoin once from somewhere (or transfer it once from your bitcoin cold storage) and draw down on it seamlessly as  you watch your low res movies.

It wouldn't be sexist it would heteronormative. Plain old prejudice in general terms. It'd be not allowing for an individual's being exceptional, in this case with respect to their past behaviour.
There a two related kinds of political correctness:
1. A milestone for a political belief: when most folk become recently aware that a significant minority hold a political belief.
2. A requirement that others speak in a way that conforms to the politically correct belief, on pain of some ill personal consequence (censorship, ostracism, sacking from a job, legal punishment, etc).
 
Whether political correctness of the first type is good or bad depends on the political belief. When it became politically correct that "women ought get the vote", or "Blacks ought not be slaves" these were good. 
Political correctness of the second type is always bad. Because freedom of speech is important, folk should be free to express politically incorrect views - even politically incorrect views that are also incorrect simpliciter.  


No I can't. But I also can't rule out the some of the bitcoin developers are female. What's the gender of "celil-kj", "fsb4000", or "zw"? We can't know just by looking at their handle. 


Why alienate an entire gender unnecessarily? Why box someone in with prejudice when you could facilitate their being exceptional?

It probably works like this:
As a file uploader (of a document, video, podcast, etc) you pay a small amount to upload. Say $USD 0.0001 (but using bitcoins). That small amount goes to Kim Dotcom.
The incentive for you as an uploader, even with nobody else downloading the file, is that you don't have to pay a subscription for the service and don't have your personal details data mined, advertising targeted, and sold on to third parties, etc.
But file downloads cost a small amount too. Say $USD 0.0002 (but using bitcoins). That will be split between you, the uploader, and Kim Dotcom. If your file is popular you, the uploader, could make a significant amount of money.
As a downloader you pay a very small amount to get the file, too small to feel like it costs too much. But you support both the file sharing service and the uploader: without having to pay a subscription fee, for content you are not interested in; you don't have to put up with advertising; and your personal details aren't abused.
There are commercial pirates: those who copy content they didn't create, against the creator's wishes, and distribute that copy for a fee. It remains to be seen how they will be handled. Youtube, for example, is plagued both by: those who copy original content and try to exploit it for revenue; and by the false filing of a copyright claims against against content creators.

Something has extrinsic value if it is valued as a means to some other value.
Something has intrinsic value if it is valued in and of itself.
E.g When I swim laps at the pool I value it exclusively for the health benefits it gives me; I don't value the swimming in and of itself. That is, for me my swimming laps has exclusively extrinsic value and no intrinsic value.
By contrast when I body surf I value this for the health benefits and also the pleasure of surfing in and of itself. So body surfing, for me, has extrinsic value and intrinsic value.

A hardware wallet controlled by you is not obviously safer than another alternative. It depends on the values for "you" and "controlled".

Ver himself sometimes uses  "Bitcoin Core" V "Bitcoin Cash" to reference the different forks (or "the original code base from the fork" if we prefer). In being pissed at that particular interviewer (if this is what you, have in mind) for using "BCash" Ver could plausibly be justified in the interviewer's questing begging: assuming the truth of a conclusion, that BTC is closer to the original vision of Bitcoin and BCH is not. That is, rather than joining in a debate over which "Is Bitcoin" and using non loaded references to the two contenders in the debate.

Well I'm glad you've withdrawn the accusation. For you didn't assert "it is possible you are a socket puppet", which is would be a true assertion that would apply to any account, you asserted that they were a sock puppet (as I think you now acknowledge). 
You new accusation, that is spreading fear uncertainty and doubt, also doesn't bear much weight when:
* They've expressed that they value both Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash; but
* They hold a rather circumspect position "Bitcoin Cash is leading in a better direction"; and
* Have implored people to do further research.

Something has intrinsic value if it is valued as an end in itself. Something has extrinsic value if it is valued as a means to an end.
When gold, for example, is valued for its use in electronics, the gold is being valued extrinsically. When gold is valued for its look and texture, as in a piece of jewellery, it is being valued intrinsically.
Valuing something as a store of value is always an extrinsic valuing. The question is does that thing also have an intrinsic value, is it also valued as an end in itself. Bananas and gold both count as being valued intrinsically as both are valued as ends in itself. 
Paper cash is never valued intrinsically (even if you value its use as fuel, that would be an extrinsic valuing, valuing it as a means to warmth). Excepting, that is, when sheer wealth accumulation is festishized as an end in itself.

This is a sincere answer: Given the variety of answers in this very thread, rather than universal endorsement of a single wiki page listing best practice, I'd look to:
* Outsource security to full time security professionals;
* Who store and manage money at their site;
* Who are insured against theft so that even if they get rolled, I won't loss my money;
* Who have a good IT systems in place to keep my account;
* Who could release funds to my family if I died.
In other words I'd convert the Bitcoins to cash and keep it in a bank.
But, of course, I know that's not the spirit of the question. You are just asking for the best practice for the highest security when storing bitcoins. 
Apart from joining you, OP, in surveying the other answer I'd only add: You could look to coinbase. They do have more than 100 Bitcoins in their possession; and of others peoples money furthermore. The chief thing to note is that they store most of their funds offline in "drives and paper backups [that] are distributed geographically in safe deposit boxes and vaults around the world".

I think, as a general rule, sellers and buyers want a 3rd party that will be objective and fair, not a 3rd party that will simply favour them over the other party. Just as we expect from court judgement, or a court mediation.


It is true that sellers usually set terms, which consumers simply take or leave. However, if 3rd parties are independent from both seller and consumer, and are  equally incentivized,  getting an equal fee from seller and consumer, then the market could but consumer pressure on sellers to use 3rd parties with a reputation for fairness. Part of the appeal of sending bitcoin to widgets.com could be that they use "Super trusted 3rd party to back the transaction".


I would have thought so but apparently not. That is, the 3rd party, PayPal, has a reputation of generally favouring the buyer over the seller. I'm not clear why. Knowing why might very much help us here.


Unfortunately I'm too tired at this point to give that the proper consideration it deserves :)


If the 3rd party is equally able to be chosen by sellers and consumers (and you've provided a plausible argument why this would not be the case); and if the 3rd party is equally funded by sellers and consumers ... we might hope for a lack of bias.
But in all this perhaps "reputation" is a sticking point. For it would seem that reputation would be necessary for a 3rd party to build and maintain but digital reputation is a difficult thing. Thing of Yelp, for example.

I take the OP to have intended to be referencing UberX rather than Uber.
**UberX** facilitates matching passengers with drivers operating outside the normal taxi regulations.  **Uber** is for connecting passengers with driver operating *within* the normal taxi regulations.
So I take the OPs implication to be: if those taxi regulations become enforced then UberX's central servers could be readily shut down by the authorities; and that there shouldn't be taxi regulations.
Are taxi regulations desirable?
A selected reading in favour of the pro side from  ...






If you are happy to be convinced by that empirical data that shows, in those cases, that taxi deregulation tends to make conditions worse for consumers and providers then it doesn't follow that deregulation remains bad given that these observations are of effects before UberX days.
The issue then becomes what can an internet connected App/Service like UberX provide to change one's expectation that the outcome would be different if taxi deregulation occurred again in the same areas (noting the centrality of the computer servers is irrelevant for this question)?

On the assumption you are happy to receive some feedback in this very thread ...
I've read-skimmed the first few chapters, and glanced at the remaining.
Your dedication to analysing difficult concepts and communicating them clearly, is manifest in your writing. This is why I look forward to buying the finished product.
To the extent you are addressing your intended audience, your goal is substantially achieved


However, you seem to be missing a key audience: non-coders, nevertheless technically competent, who are after a best practices, step-by-step, practical guide to storing, transacting and managing their bitcoin securely. A best practices guide that is also embedded in the conceptual overview of bitcoin you are providing.
To contextualise what I mean by that ...
Taking us through the reasoning and steps of a procedure like:
* Install a Light Client on an internet connected computer to serve as a watch wallet.
* Install and configure a thumb drive with a linux and a Light Client (e.g Electrum) with one's printer drivers for offline transaction signing. How to do this so it remains "never having been connected to the internet".
* How to move offline signed transactions to the watch wallet.
* Throwing some paper wallets into the mix.
* Explain the steps/reasons for Best practice principles like:
 - Use a printer that is connected via USB, not ethernet.
 - How to verify the authenticity of a file you've downloaded from the internet.
 - Use a laser printer, not an inkjet (laser printers melt ink into the paper which makes it waterproof).
 - The deterministic wallet advantage.
 - Securing your wallet master seed/mnemonic phrase with m of n secret sharing.
 - Etc.
In other words, an Andreas version that includes the kind of content in  
If the above misrepresents best practice, that would only underscore the need for a guide.
Perhaps, then, going through a use of Trezor to show how it makes some of the steps above redundant. Also explaining how we can trust Trezor.
Just to differentiate the above from what you already have ...
I see some clear step by step examples for non coders to get started in the initial chapters. E.g There is the explanation of how Alice gets bitcoin and stores them in a web wallet. You also have a chapter using the reference client from the command line. That chapter serves a good purpose: to go through most of the sorts of commands any bitcoin client will need to handle. While some of these commands may be made opaque to general users using a GUI, it is clear you are using the reference client for explanatory purposes. You also have a section on paper wallets. You do explain what deterministic wallets are.
But in the middle of that is missing the best practice, step by step, guide for securing your bitcoin. 
I note that which is plain to all bitcoin enthusiasts and which you've mentioned in one of your talks: there is no way main stream adoption will take place while expecting the average joe to think through offline thumbdrive linux installs, watch wallets, change addresses, etc.
Nevertheless there are some of us who are willing to be early adopters partly because we enjoy having to go some way into thinking about:
* Crypto, privacy and security;
* Currency
* The distributed trust breakthrough;
* Computers systems in general (so we like playing with offline linux installs ... ).
So such a best practice, step by step, guide for securing your bitcoin (without and with a Trezor) has contemporary value, I'd suggest.
Not least because, also, if we want to be early adopters who secure their coins properly, we simply need to know what the best practice is. That is, even if we are more interested in *using* bitcoins than being fascinated by bitcoin, or coding a bitcoin client, we need such a guide.
Maybe such a guide is better as a separate book/phamplet/wiki. Maybe such a guide is better as something fully open source, even on release, so that best practice can be updated as bitcoin evolves (and it could save you having to do some work you might not be interested in doing). Either way I imagine the community would very much value your being a key author/editor of, if you'd rather not be sole author/editor of, such a guide.

This just seems like an enormous confuse over whether "Intrinsic Value" references Marx's Labour theory of Value, or the distinction between intrinsic and extrinsic value.
If the later is being referenced Bitcoin is largely valued extrinsically and only sometimes intrinsically. For to be extrinsically valued is just to valued as a means to an end, to be intrinsically valued is to be valued as an end in itself (under the distinction).
Just as, for example, fiat currency is largely valued extrinsically (as a medium of exchange for something else) and only sometimes intrinsically (as when collectors collect notes as a thing of beauty).

They don't want someone who will just side with them, they want someone who will side with them because they are in the right. They can only that from an impartial third party.
And, as with a court system, it's not just a decision that's desired but a reasoning for that decision, and a process to go through (a process that can provide all sorts of possibilities like *resolving* the dispute rather than, unless necessary, merely finding in favour of one party over the other)


This issue is around the nature of the "agree upon". for example, rightly points out that since sellers generally set the terms of sale there's the potential there for sellers only to offer third parties who favour sellers. So that a buyer might "agree"  to the third party the seller puts forward might nevertheless be an agreement to a third party who is not independent. The issue is to specify the mechanism that provides for an independent and impartial third party.

Look at one of the good posts, from your link, that are attempting to describe the purpose and benefit of Triple Entry Accounting

Price was not the only economic outcome at issue. There was also short-haul refusals, and poor treatment of passengers. I quoted "overserved airport locations" with "taxicab drivers complained of waiting hours at airports for customers at taxicab stands."
But on price, yes, it seems plausible that an internet connected app gives consumers a historically unprecedented means to get near perfect price comparison information (as the internet has started to do more generally for goods and services across the board). And that price information could make the difference. 
But access to the price comparison information wasn't the only argument. There was


... the implication being that if a driver has fewer rides they want to/need to charge more per ride. But indeed consumer access to price comparison information may well (and under free market principles should) undermine the ability of drivers to charge that higher rate (due to other drivers eager to attract consumers for more rides).

Both model and the OpenBazaar model (with a third party dispute resolver) are very compelling.
So the interesting thing about bitcoin, as you know, is that it has been sold as means to avoid middle parties and centralised authorities. 
The story goes: given that transactions are irreversible vendors will like bitcoin because they won't get ripped off by buyers defrauding them. Vendors don't have to suffer at the hands of paypal. Transactions fees can be kept really low, so continues the story, as dispute resolution and fraud protection is not a cost that central authority has to distribute to end users (vendors and consumers).
But what about consumers? Well consumers like "buyer protections". Consumers like being able to reverse credit card charges if a seller is ripping them off. However, just as for sellers with paypal, consumers don't necessarily get a just dispute resolution outcome from their bank or credit card company. Those companies  will make some summary judgement, rather than a fair one.
My thought here has been: this bitcoin story doesn't show what it purports to. It doesn't show that a payment system should be constructed to eliminate dispute resolution. It shows, rather, that we currently have inadequate dispute resolution. I think we, sellers and buyers, really want a quick, fair, and reliable dispute resolution mechanism (short of any sort of court case) when, in the rare case, our transactions go wrong.
So your openbazaar model, with the 2 of 3 escrow model, seems very much a potential means to give us the dispute resolution mechanism that we want, and that we've never had before.
Given the central role of the dispute resolver in your model, and that you intend to allow some fee for it. I'd suggest changing your description on  so that it's doesn't bold "no fees" and includes a sentence something like that which you've already given me


One thing to notice about model is that, if it has some legs in the real world, it need not be an alternative to OpenBazaar but a part of it. That is, if suggestion doesn't eliminate the need for third party intervention it might make third party intervention less likely (given the mutual incentives to resolve the dispute between themselves rather than for one party to be incentivised to ignore it).
So OpenBazaar could build model into the 2 of 3 escrow transaction, with the 3x the value of the good being sent by the buyer, into escrow.
With or without model OpenBazaar could also take inspiration from it as means to hold the fee for the dispute resolver.  For example, the buyer and seller might send through the dispute resolution fee 1%, or whatever, at the same time the buyer makes the purchase (and sends funds to the dispute resolver). If the trade goes through ok then the fee is released back to the seller and buyer.
However, I'm inclined to think that a flat fee to the dispute resolver, whether they have to resolve a dispute or not, is going to work better for everyone.

With the second, that you believe it is implied. Because you are the one saying it.
Both are assertions and both constitute an opinion. Both are logically equivalent.
Unless, that is, the "I believe" in the first statement is intended not to flag "I hold the following to be true:" but a reduced degree of confidence. As in "I hold the following to be true but with a large degree of doubt".
But even in that case both statements count as being an assertion and an opinion.

The analogy to the father suggesting to the son that he ought freely choose to visit his grandmother on Sunday is a good one.
This seems fitting not only to (contemporary) boss/employee relationships and "unlimited time off" (which I too have no experience with) but to work in general. There exists a general demand from society that you should *want* to work.
That's a really oppressive attitude as it feeds the notion that work is something that should be created (politicians will stand on a plank of "creating jobs") rather than eliminated.
comments about "unlimited time off" specifically seem correct. The specific wording in the original post was "unlimited paid time off". That simply can't be right and it's the lack of clarity about what that could mean, given that it can't be literally true, that causes the problems.
Conditions of employment would be far more relaxing if the expectation of how much time you could take off was well defined (and generous). E.g. Standard working hours are 30 per week; you get 12 weeks off, paid, per year for any reason (sickness or holiday); If you work less than 30 hours per week on any one week you can make up for it in another; If you work over 30 hours per week you can take excess hours off in another week; You can take unpaid leave for 2 years, if you have worked at the company for 2 years or more; ....
Change the variables (hours per week, week off per year) as you see fit, but change them in a defined way to set expectations. 
For although it is entirely true that results are not always correlated with hours worked, somebody can invent something that yields an enormous productivity gain, they generally are so correlated. Hours worked seems like the best proxy we have for being clear on the level of effort we expect to be put into a project or task. 
Being clear about the hours helps everyone. It helps the business plan based on labour costs; helps employees plan their time off; helps employees trade hours with each other in a way that maintains the operation.
As Žižek is suggesting: let's not hide the fundamental nature of the employer/employee relationship where one is paying the other for labour. That is quite different to when volunteers come together with an equal financial stake in the project (as business partners do when forming a company; or as friends do when going on holiday; or programmers do when working unpaid on an open source project).

This part of the discussion is very compelling.
I've been out of the and Bitcoin loop for a long while so I'm missing much of the motivating context.  But I'm taking to be primarily motivated by objections to moderation that amounts to dogma preservation. That is, the moderation of opposing views. Or moderation based based on whimsy of a moderator in terms of where they think the topic of conversation should go. 
That sort of moderation, if true, would be disturbing.
My chief interest here is free speech in general, it's limits, and how that might apply to the ...


... or, less ambitiously, what the right moderation scheme should be for any subreddit that properly protects freedom of speech.
The first thing to say about free speech is that even most of the fierce advocates for free speech, among which I count myself, do not argue for no limits on speech. Not many advocates for free speech, who've thought about the topic for more than three minutes, would endorse the freedom for folk to scream quotes from Shakespeare through a megaphone, in the middle of the suburbs, in the dead of night. Most advocates for free speech will endorse some limits on the freedom to say what you like, when you like, and how you like.
And so we get good at identifying the just limits to free speech. E.g. We (in this case the law) will place limits on speech for "time, place, and manner" reasons.
But we seem to be bad at identifying the unjust limits to free speech. That is, it is rare to find, in legislation, clauses that identify what will count as unjustified restrictions on speech. Where you do find such legislative clauses that identify speech that will not be limited, it'll often be wrong e.g. exemptions for speech with academic, scientific, or news merit (merit is generally something we should be free to assess ourselves).
Most of the identification of unjust limits to free speech tend, rather, to have been shaken out through case law. One random example is, in the US, [Snyder v. Phelps](


So bringing this back to an online context I don't think, if we want speech that is properly free, one could reasonably allow, to take the first case off the rank, obvious spam. It's easy to see how a couple of bots repeatedly posting "Make your dick larger, follow this link, ..." could drown out the speech of others: there could be so much of that in a thread that a conversation between humans becomes practically impossible. Some speech constitutes a threat to free speech.
So if meant by "unmoderated forum", a forum without moderation whatsoever, I don't think that would be workable or just.
So what would an alternative to reddit or a moderated subreddit look like if it was to properly protect freedom of speech? There are two fronts to consider: the right use of tools; the right set of policies;
In an online context in addition to unique threat to free speech (like spam) you have unique tools to handle the threat (like algorithms that identify strings of texts, or bad IPs, or bad usernames). Each of the following tools, that others have mentioned, are worth thinking about:
* "moderation should at least be opt-in in my view". That might work very well when thinking about moderation at the level of topic relevancy, or for moderation against "offensive" content. 
  In my view reddit has largely solved the topic relevancy problem, in virtue of hierarchical comments: when somebody goes off on a tangent then you can ignore that branch if you aren't interested in it. Nevertheless we could have moderation for relevancy, for those that care about that, as an opt-in. So topics and comments that relevancy fiends object to aren't seen by them. The rest of us see everything. Some subbreddits already provide users with the opportunity to filter through topic tags (e.g. r/worldnews/ allows you to filter out trump articles).
  So too delicate users could opt-in not to see "offensive" topics or comments, that the rest of us can see.
 But correctly identifies the problem with this scheme, for comments at least:
 &gt; Bitcointalk.org solves this partially by allowing you to ignore certain users, but than fails to follow through because this breaks up the conversation and than [sic] others can quote the users you are ignoring.
* &gt;&gt; Unmoderated presents the problem with scams , slander , and spam
  &gt; You can moderate those. No problem, just make sure you open up your mod-logs.
  Open mod logs seems like it would at least make moderation behaviour accountable. The idea would be to keep the original content that was censored intact in the log. The mod logs could even have some degree of compression E.g. "Make your dick grow larger."; removed as spam; 100 times in topic "Bitcoin goes to the moon".
Those represent attempts to implement what I'd call "Soft censorship". Content is removed from discussion: but you can still get to the content if you want to.
In a forum that properly protects free speech I think there'd still be room of "Hard censorship": removal of content such that nobody can get to it (waybackmachine aside). It seems right to apply hard censorship to doxxing, for example.
Then there's "Censorship at the gate": kinds of content that are prevented from being posted in the first place. This might, for example, apply to spam when the spamming account (and/or associated IP) has been banned.
as a candidate way to implement "Censorship at the gate"


Tangentially, an email protocol that requires that all recipients send you some bitcoin, or their message doesn't get through, might better work to solve spam. When you reply to the sender you return their payment. 
So online tools provide more options to think about the possibility of, and desirability of: soft censorship; hard censorship; and censorship at the gate.
On the policy front any forum I'd be responsible for creating would make clear that the following is allowed:
* Offensive content.
* Personal insults.
* Off topic or irrelevant content (without applying to obvious spam).
* Trolling.
* Lying.
That wouldn't prevent other users from criticizing topics or comments as "off topic" or "offensive", etc., or in a reddit context using a voting button, but it would prevent such content from being hard censored or censored at the gate.
I'll finish on Reddit's voting. Perhaps all downvotes should be justified by the downvoter. This could be enforced programmatically. E.g. that a downvote doesn't register until a reason is supplied (possibly from a list of drop down options for the most common cases).
In short, I too have been kicking around these issues: of wanting to identify the best way to protect freedom of speech while somehow allowing for the handling of, and reduction of, noise or low quality content. Although there's much to think about I'm optimistic that near ideal solutions are possible.

That is, a "belief" or "opinion" may or may not be based a justification about what is true.
Two people can hold contradictory "opinions" and "beliefs" about the same topic:




Those two clauses are semantically ordinary even when Fred's belief and opinion is justified by good reasons and firm empirical grounds. And "believes" and "is of the opinion" here just play the same semantic role: "takes to be true".

Both of you misunderstand the meaning of "intrinsic value".
Something has extrinsic value if it is valued as a means to something else. Something has intrinsic value if it valued as an end in itself.
Bitcoin, like fiat, has extrinsic value because it can be used as a means to something else. Ordinarily valued bitcoin has no intrinsic value because it is not valued in and of itself.
By contrast, gold in the shape of statue is often valued both extrinsically (because it can be traded for something else) and intrinsically (because the owner values the lustre of the material independently of whether it can be traded).
I can value my wife, or Yosemite Valley, as ends in themselves. That would be to value those things intrinsically and without being willing to trade them for other things. Indeed I might insist they not be traded for other things: that my wife not be amenable to the slave trade; and the national park not be sold off for any other purpose.

Gavin is pointing to a way in which pseudo-sceptics abuse anomalies, something which is going on at the moment with respect to Craig Wright's identity.
It is one thing to claim that Craig Wright has yet to provide sufficient proof to the world that he is Satoshi Nakamoto. For example by pointing out that he has yet to release, for an early bitcoin Gavin (ostensibly) witnessed Craig message-sign: the BitcoinPublicAddress; the message Gavin supplied to Craig; and the BitcoinPublicAddress-Message-Resultant-Signature (from which any of us could therefore check that Craig is in possession of the relevant BitcoinPrivateKey).
However, it is another to claim that Craig Wright is (likely) not Satoshi Nakamoto and is (likely) a scam artist.
If your position toward a proposition is no longer one of doubt but of declaring the proposition (likely) false then you are no longer sceptical about the proposition but take a positive stance toward it. Declaring a proposition (likely) false, moving away from scepticism about it, is fine - so long as you have sufficient justification.
But do so on the basis of some anomalies, when any anomaly will do (being visited by the Australian Federal Police at a point in the past for tax auditing purposes; or the release of an unnecessarily lengthy blog post without the required proof) is, as the article rightly points out, an argument from ignorance ...
* We haven't received sufficient proof CW is SN (We are "ignorant" of the sufficient proof)
* Here's a blog post that doesn't contain the proof we'd normally expect to be provided in these circumstances by a person motivated to provide one (the anomaly).
* Therefore it is likely that CW is not SN.
The resulting conclusion is pseudo-sceptical in two senses:
1. It's no longer a sceptical conclusion; and
2. It's based on an invalid argument.
I don't mean to claim that card carrying members of a local Sceptics club who form positive judgements, like "Vaccines do not cause autism", no longer deserve to march under the banner of being a "(Careful-with-the-evidence-and-reason)  Sceptic".

Thanks, that helpfully repeats (it's informative to have the same things explained in different terms) some of the things was referencing.


That took me a while to parse. I mis-recalled "Swipe" as referencing "Swift", that banking protocol for international transfers. But I see now at  there is a an Eftpos card branded as "Coinjar Swipe". 


So yes, that means they must have an Australian account.
... and therefore those parts of CoinJar's operations currently depending on having an Australian account would seem just as vulnerable to the current issue of bank's shutting down Bitcoin entites without explanation.

That explanation is consistent with my understanding of your subsequent explanation.

The "computer of ours" did not have a BTC wallet. Rather the "computer of ours" had access to blockchain.info's computer, via a web session. The BTC wallet was stored on blockchain.info's computer, not yours.

The following 4 claims are distinct:
1. Wright is Satoshi.
2. Wright is not Satoshi.
3. Wright is a scammer.
4. Wright is not a scammer.
To assert any of those claims as true you need separate evidence. I believe none of those claims to be sufficiently supported by evidence.
Yet the OP is asserting (implicitly) 1 to be false; (implicitly) 2 to be true; (explicitly) 3 to be true; and (implicitly) 4 to be false.
In principle if there is not sufficient evidence, or invalid evidence is offered, for "Wright is Satoshi" it does not follow that "Wright is not Satoshi" nor, more thickly, that "Wright is a Scammer".
Absence of evidence is not evidence of absence. Or in this case "Absence of evidence that Wright is Satoshi is not evidence that Wright is not Satoshi".
If someone asserts:


... That "chewbacca is hairy" is not sufficient proof for the moon landing does not mean that it is false that the moon landing occurred. Moreover it does not follow that the asserter is a scammer (they might be insane; or making a joke; etc).

The language "beyond a reasonable doubt" is a committal as it gets. That he also says "It's possible I'm wrong, but I don't think I am" just references the doubt that he has.
Generally speaking "beyond a reasonable doubt" references a conclusion that held with the possibility of being wrong. And if, for example, courts of law demanded a higher standard of proof, that you convict an alleged criminal only with a conclusion held "beyond all doubt" then you'd always have to return a "not guilty" verdict.

That's not quite right.
If Wright publicly posted the BitcoinPublicAddress, Message, and BitcoinPublicAddress-Message-Resultant-Signature then it remains plausible that Wright doesn't posses the BitcoinPrivateKey (and is colluding with the real Satoshi to keep the real Satoshi's identity secret - real Satoshi does the signing with the BitcoinPrivateKey and passes those three items onto Wright).
On the other hand if Wright: publicly posted the BitcoinPublicAddress, Message, and BitcoinPublicAddress-Message-Resultant-Signature; and was witnessed by a prominent figure, like Gavin, doing the signing (with a message supplied by Gavin on the spot) ... then it becomes less plausible that Wright doesn't possess the BitcoinPrivateKey. That is, flipping the double negative, it becomes more plausible that Wright does possess the BitcoinPrivateKey.
Of course, at the moment, neither scenario is true. That is, the BitcoinPublicAddress, Message, and BitcoinPublicAddress-Message-Resultant-Signature have not been publicly posted.
That's enough to hold that Wright's claim to be Satoshi is, at the moment, not sufficiently proven (for we who were not present at the signing meeting). 
But it's not enough to conclude that Wright is not Satoshi (I'm not taking your "Not buying it" to commit you to the view that Wright is not Satoshi); and it's not enough to conclude, more thickly, that Wright is likely a scammer (as some are concluding).

I take the statement to mean that the US seized his money (as well as assets) that was stored outside the US.
But you are right that the article doesn't give enough info.
Originally, in [2012-02-21]( when arrested in NZ ...


It's not clear on my quick skimming of that article who did the financial seizing: the NZ courts acting on behalf of the US grand in the state of Virginia, or the US grand in the state of Virginia directly.
Either way it does seem true that the US can seize money outside the US.

Interesting post, of yours.
Firstly, and relatively unimportantly, it's not tautological. A tautology (as a matter of logic) is


For example,
* 2 + 2 = 4
* A bachelor is an unmarried man.
* The price rises when the price goes up.
Here "because there are more buyers than sellers" serves as one logical possibility for the "Bitcoin price is going up". Another logical possibility for the price rise is because it is set that way by a central regulator.
Noting, that is, what's logically possible is broader that what is practically possible (Bitcoin is designed to operate without, indeed in defiance of, central regulation).
You seem to be using "tautology" for "that which is obviously true", which is not the meaning of "tautology".
Secondly, Andreas seems precisely to be asserting that there is no further explanation to be found and warning against a range of possible explanations that might parade as having warrant.
In your linked blog post an example is made of the provision of the answer "God" as the "semantic stopsign" to the question of (paraphrasing) "What causes the big bang?". ... (quoting)  "What distinguishes a semantic stopsign is failure to consider the obvious next question."
Here Andreas appears, rather, to warn against providing an answer like "God" when, for the moment, all we can justifiably assert is that there was a Big Bang.
On topic, Andreas appears to be warning against supplying reasons for the price rise when none can be found (beyond supply and demand). It is, in another words, an assertion that short time price movements in markets are beyond explaining more deeply that recognizing some kind of supply and demand pressure.
In broad terms it's an assertion of agnosticism about an issue: that all folk from a similar epistemic vantage point cannot justify an answer to the question at hand, here "Why is the supply and demand such that bitcoin is rising?".
You might think agnosticism on this issue is unjustified, day traders will would agree with you, but it doesn't therefore follow that Andrea's agnosticism counts as an attempt to end thought and analysis.

Yeah he's a great analyst for that reason among many. 
I'm not sure about the advice on what to do with your 12 - 24 words.
Writing them down with pen and paper is good in that it's a manual thing that is not travelling through a computer system (entailing Battlestar Galactica type protection).
However, putting that on single piece of paper in a fire proof safe from your local office store seems to present a number of significant risks. Such safes ...
* Have limited fire protection. In some fires they won't survive.
* Are small and readily liftable. A thief in your house would be attracted to the safe, just take it, and be alerted to the 12 - 24 words having value.
* If you die your estate loses your bitcoin (recall Andreas suggested not associating instructions with your 12 - 24 words).
In short, the advice risks not properly guarding against fire, theft, and death (although it should be good in flood, barring house-floating-down-the-river flooding). Recalling that at stake was "a lot" of bitcoin, where "a lot" was some value of getting upset from the loss.
The alternative, that properly protects against those risks, might necessitate a more complicated scheme (withstanding disparagement of the complicated schemes). Specifically, an m of n secret sharing scheme (See  
For example, one set of practical values for m of n could be 2 of 5. You keep two of the shares. But you keep each of those two shares in disparate, obscure, and low value locations in your house, without identifying what they mean. You keep one share in your shoe box under your bed, the other in your jar of cookies in your kitchen. The other three shares you distribute among family or friends (at three distinct geographical locations) with instructions about what to do them (and, perhaps, advice about which local bitcoin experts to contact who'd be able to follow those instructions). That would:
* Guard against house theft. The thieves are unlikely to be interested in your low value jar of cookies and shoe box. But if they did, for some reason, take those items they wouldn't (normally) know what to do with the shares. By contrast under Andrea's scheme even if the thief doesn't know what to do with the 12 - 24 words they find in your safe ... you no longer have your 12 - 24 words. 
* Allow you to independently recover from backup without having to contact your friends and family.
* Guard against fire because you can recover from any two of your three friends/family.
* Guard against your death because any two of your three friends/family can recover your bitcoins.
* Guards against one of your friends/family losing their share.
On the durability of pen and paper, particularly with respect to water damage, Andrea's solution would guard against it (being in a flood proof safe). However there is the advice from Canton Becker in the paper wallet context 


... that might require the rigmarole of hooking your printer up via USB to an airgaped laptop running Tails (borrowing from the sort of scheme that was the fashion before hardware wallets). But the water protection for your shares under my proposed scheme might be worth it. Especially since it entails *not* using a safe.
TL;DR: Perhaps you should use 2 of 5 secret sharing for your 12 - 24 words, to properly and practically guard against theft, flood, fire and death.

No, that would be insufficient. Such an event would be compatible with the real Satoshi, not being Craig Wright, wanting to entrench her anonymity by having the world think an imposter, Craig Wright, is the real Satoshi.

Indeed it is. That an account of yours should be frozen because your business does well all of a sudden is outrageous. Quite analogous to the OP's story.


Anecdotally, and yours and the OP's add to that large list, seems to favour consumers at the expense of sellers. That is, in lieu of getting their fraud protection and dispute mediation right they'll be happy to fuck the seller over in order to keep the buyer's happy. And indeed if the transaction occurs via Bitcoin, directly between buyer and seller, then the seller doesn't face any of these issues.
However,  a direct buyer to seller bitcoin transaction just tips the scale unfairly in the other direction. That is, now buyers are vulnerable to fraud, scams, and poor business practices generally. 
What's often undervalued by some of the bitcoin community, and the community at large, is the value of a service that properly mediates disputes between buyers and seller and otherwise helps prevent fraud.
I'm unclear about how well Banks do on this front. Anecdotally, like PayPal, they do well to protect buyers. But do Banks do far better for sellers? I don't here as many horror stories on that front compared to those for Paypal, but I can't answer the question with confidence.
None of this, however justly (or not) Banks currently mediate between buyer and seller, counts against bitcoin as such. For bitcoin can be used with an escrow service.
So if I'm right that we might, in the future, more greatly value a service that properly mediates disputes between buyers and sellers then bitcoin "is the answer":
* Not because it facilitates direct buyer to seller transactions; but 
* Because it facilitates mediated (through an escrow service) buyer to seller transactions. In this case escrow services could freely compete in the market place to rise and fall according to their reputation for being just.

At the very least Wright is not claiming he has no tax obligations. It's one thing for the ATO to claim you have outstanding tax to pay, it'd be another for an individual to claim they have no future tax to pay.
It's unclear but the implication, by Wright, seems to be that the investigation launched by the ATO into his tax affairs was criminally baseless.

Not if hat's the only mistake a government makes or it emerges that Bitcoins don't benefit people.
In general, governments provide an important function by providing social services, redistributing wealth, forcibly taxing people and spending money on large infrastructure projects more efficiently than a free market could.
