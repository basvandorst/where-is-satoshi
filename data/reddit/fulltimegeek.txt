Everybody wants bigger blocks, but no one is providing a way to incentivize full-nodes. Hence why we have the **Great Schism of Bitcoin**.
Right now ... Bigger Blocks == Less full-nodes  == More centralization
@_date: 2015-12-28 17:37:32
Full-nodes (servers that allow you to download the blockchain) are not compensated. 
So, if we increase the block size there will be even less full-nodes since they would have to provide even more resources to the network for free.

@_date: 2015-06-30 19:09:08
Ok, even though your fee is higher than mine your fee still seems to be too low. It seems like you get a lot of small payments to your wallet since 9 inputs were needed to create your transaction. 
Your transaction size is 1.4Kb. Since it is above 1kb you probably should've paid double the fee. Those are just my two cents, I could be wrong with the exact amount you should've paid but it definitely seems like you underpaid.
You could always just rebroadcast this transaction again but with a higher fee. Or, you can just wait until it gets accepted into the blockchain.
What wallet do you use if you don't mind me asking?

If so, is JustGiving holding the bitcoin wallets of the charities and automatically withdraw/converting it to Pounds and depositing it into the charities bank account?

Ah ... no it's not. The blatant disregard of Dash (Digital Cash) is mind boggling.
@_date: 2015-11-08 15:57:19
First off pre/instamine implies that a coin, before being released publically, is mined by the dev. **THIS DID NOT HAPPEN**.
Dash, or Xcoin as it was known at the time, was released publicly first and then the mining started. The reason so many coins were mined in the first 24 hours was because the difficulty algorithm was set to auto-correct every 500 blocks. The difficulty was too low for the amount of hashing power of all the Xcoin miners (not just Evan).
[Here]( is a thread that can better explain the "instamine".
@_date: 2015-11-08 16:16:15
Ok, let's assume that the quick emission rate of Xcoin never happend. Do you still believe that Monero is more innovative and a better currency than Dash? I don't see how in good conscious you can say Yes to that. But, looking at your post history, I'm sure you can contrive some justification for it.

Masternodes/full-nodes get paid 45% of the block reward.


Dash Masternodes also provide the following services to the network:
* Darksend (Anonymization of funds)
* Decentralized Governance by Blockchain (Anyone can submit proposals, i.e. contractors, to the blockchain and Masternodes vote every month which get funded)
* Instant Transactions (IX)  -- Transactions can be locked within 4 seconds

Bitcoin -- No permission required^^TM
@_date: 2015-10-18 16:37:13
Just a few corrections I would like to state regarding Dash(Digital Cash).
[Dash]( incentivizes  Masternodes, which are full-nodes, by giving them 45% of the block reward while miners also get 45%. Secondly, a masternode requires 1000 DASH not $1000. 
The 1000 DASH requirement per Masternode has been one of the main contributors for the relatively stable price. Right now there are currently ~[3300]( Masternodes/full-nodes. 
@_date: 2015-11-07 16:28:01
BIP 101 is to increase the maximum block size from 1MB to 8GB (by gradual increases over time). 
Why do some people **NOT WANT THIS??** Well, that is because Bitcoin is already suffering from a low full-node count on the network because there is no incentivisation for them. Full-nodes do not get paid but must provide enough hard drive space and bandwidth to propagate the blockchain. This will continue to cost more and more with the increase of block size. More disk space will be used per block and more bandwidth will be used when transmitting them. Right now, bitcoin has less than a total of 6000 full-nodes and this number would only decrease if the blocksize increases.
As of right now, increasing the blocksize will only hurt the bitcoin network because it will cause a further drop in full-nodes. Until we find a way to incentivize  full-nodes; increasing the block size should not be debated.
@_date: 2015-10-18 16:43:42


If you are referring to the "reference node" which was used to decide which Masternode gets paid -- that is no longer the case. Dash has implemented (DGB) Decentralized Governance by Blockchain and quorums are used for deciding who gets paid.

Well, even though there has been a professional code audit for Darksend, which uses a decentralized 2nd tier of masternodes for mixing coins, and no vulnerabilities have been discovered; Dash Evolution (January 2016) will be migrating the darksend functionality to the protocol level.

I thought about making, but been procrastinating, a wallet extension to take screen shots of QR codes. 
This would work by turning the mouse pointer into a transparent square box that you can resize by turning the mouse-wheel. Once you hover over the QR Code, you left click, it scans the QR Code and then it populates all fields in wallet accordingly.

If by click-and-drag you mean click-and-dragging the image of the QR Code, that may work. It really depends what is most intuitive to new users. One problem that you may encounter is that not all pictures are draggable depending how they are configured in the Cascading Style Sheet or embedded in the HTML code.
If I would to implement it, I would just turn the pointer to look like a bulls eye so they intuitively shoot their target. Might be dumb but I think it gets the point across. 
My point is, we need to be able to use QR Codes without the need of a camera. And I know there is already an API that can scan a file/picture of a QR Code and tell you what's encoded. The hard part is already done.

No matter how often that lie gets repeated, it will never become true. Enjoy your inferior alts.
