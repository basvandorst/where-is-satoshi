What a dumb question.  Of course it can.
@_date: 2016-06-21 01:26:29
Good idea.
@_date: 2016-06-21 14:04:50
Yeah.  Coinbase support sucks.
@_date: 2016-06-07 16:38:33
Beat me to it!

I have used them for 2.5 years and almost $19,000 USD worth of transactions, with the only issue being a withdrawal to my bank account that was delayed about 3 days.

Horrible idea.

It set my MalwareBytes off, also.

I would probably just send it to an intermediate wallet, rather than directly from one Coinbase wallet to another Coinbase wallet.  Then you can send the BTC from that intermediate wallet to wherever you'd like.
@_date: 2016-10-10 15:08:42
Yeah, their support is terrible.
@_date: 2016-05-04 18:37:02
I think you are being generous here...

How many cigarettes and moon pies will that claim get him?
@_date: 2016-05-05 14:13:34
No, I think you pretty much nailed it.
@_date: 2016-05-06 18:38:59
The supply won't be cut in half, though.  The rate of increase for the supply is what is being cut in half.

Well, to answer your last question, there is no way of knowing that any early block other than 0 and 9 actually belonged to Satoshi.  So it is entirely possible that blocks 1, 2, 3, etc. were mined by somebody else.

I have to agree with the OP; Coinbase support is abysmal at best.  I put in a ticket with Coinbase support a few days ago, and never heard back except for the automated email telling me that they would get back to me.  I am no longer having the issue that prompted me to open the support ticket, but there is absolutely no excuse for such poor customer service, especially for a company like Coinbase.  It is 2016 and your business is centered around technology; the least you can do is respond to support tickets in a timely manner.

Pretty sure Matonis is in on it.  Not sure about Gavin yet...he might have just been tricked.

You can try to double-spend (this time with a fee) and hope that a miner picks up the 2nd transaction first.  But I wouldn't worry about it.  It will clear soon, probably.
@_date: 2016-05-05 14:24:27
Yeah, not sure when that ever happened...
@_date: 2016-05-05 14:24:51
Yes, con man.
@_date: 2016-05-05 14:18:05
Bitcoin Foundation.  Hardly the same thing.
@_date: 2016-05-10 00:32:44
This is why we can't have nice things.

Faucet doesn't seem to be working...

It's a dollar and ten cents FFS.  Put up an address already.
@_date: 2016-05-05 14:23:28
Ummm....he IS an asshole
@_date: 2016-05-27 01:07:35
They're multiplying!
@_date: 2016-05-04 18:35:27
I don't think so.  Mine is the same it has been for months now.
