well said! Always create new wallets as well and using a service like MultiBit is a great idea as well b/c you can create multiple receiving addresses for a single wallet and also open multiple wallets within one screen.

Currently working just fine on my iPhone 5s. Simple bootstrap theme, nice css but nothing wild.

The idea of GEMS appears to be to get some sort of crypto asset into the hands of "regular" people. From there, they've created that "look you're doing it" moment with crypto. Just like how you had to actually make your mom take your smartphone and use it and force her to try things so she eventually wanted one. Gems builds value around specific app functionality and then leaves the user to discover the fact that they are earning value in a crypto asset. 
**tl:dr** Overall it's positive for crypto, probably neutral for Bitcoin, IMO.

Same here.  - Down about 3 hrs now.

Oh, that's totally possible. The WooCommerce integration for BitPay makes it easy for us to keep track of orders and integrate into our other systems as well.

Swarm, Storj, LTBC, TatianaCoin, BitNation, the new Overstock stock market... all new crypto projects / equities that run on counterparty. Counterparty is pretty much a go-to for secure token creation. Counterparty runs on and embeds data in the Bitcoin blockchain. So it's all backed by BTC at the end. Gems too will use Counterparty platform as well. Seems like a logical choice to me.

As someone who spends a great deal of time online "professionally" doing marketing for businesses, startups and the likes... I'm constantly using, studying and trying to leverage social media networks to build communities. I've yet to find one that is building it's entire infrastructure around a secure, cryptographic token that will be air dropped for free to it's users every day for the first 5 years the network is online. If I have a number of simple encrypted messaging apps to choose amongst in a year or so from now, I'll feel good knowing I *got in* on one that rewarded me proportionately to the extent I adopted it earlier than others.

No. Any token created upon the Counterparty platform is secured by the Bitcoin blockchain so that saves wasted energy for redundant POW or POS mechanisms. You will need to get a wallet at [Counterwallet.io]( to actually cash your Gems out to Bitcoin if you wanted but you could have and use your Gems right within the app itself-- at least this is the way I assume it would organized.

imagine if all systems could be completely voluntary....

Thanks. I'm planning on doing so soon but it might be a few weeks at least as I don't have my full working studio all in one place at the moment. Thanks for the feedback!

I wasn't guaranteeing the "every time" in my point, or wasn't intending to. I was just trying to point out that Bitcoin is gaining value by providing value, not because of speculation. 
@_date: 2013-05-22 23:52:44
What interests me about Bitcoin is that there is no centralized aggressive organization needed to "protect" or authenticate Bitcoin transactions. Bitcoin doesn't require violence to mine, use, trade or hold. I'm betting that there is a market for those values.
