well, I have it always with me.
You can also keep it in a safe at home or a bank, but it depends on you.
The most important thing is, to keep the words safe, so in case there are any problems you will be able to recover on a new hw wallet for example.

Well I personally bought a Ledger Nano S hardware wallet and for now I am happy with it. It cost some money, but it is a complete offline storage for your coins, they support multiple types of coins. I would probably suggest you to buy something like this. Storing coins on your local computer is still open to attacks, it is enough to visit a suspicious webpage and your coins could get lost while an offline hardware wallet would provide you with more security based on my opinion. (this is not an advertisement, personal experience)

Open a ticket with them, hard to tell, maybe they had some outage on their side (coinbase).

Well, I would suggest to do that ASAP, since if you submit a ticket now, you will not get a response today or not tomorrow either and this could take days to solve. So it depends on your decision.

Well, hardly. To buy some "cryptocurrency" you most likely need some exchanges, except in rare cases, where you have some friends for example, who are selling and you give them a bitcoin address generated on your local wallet or hardware wallet. Then it could be anonymous in some way, this way you eliminate the exchanges and identitiy verification. But everyone will be still able to see transactions on the blockchain to and from your wallet address. So 100% anonymity does not exist based on my observation.

I don't have enough info on those, so I would leave it to users who are actively using those. But what I can tell for sure, with bitcoin, litecoin and etherum we all have some tools to look at transactions with details like "address from" and "address to" amongst many, also the amount.

It works just like a wallet on your computer. For the Ledger Nano S, you have apps in the app store with which you can interact with the Ledger, there I have some issues with the functionality, but if one gets to know it, it is quite okay. After the initial setup, you have a 24 word recovery seed, so in case that someone enters the pin wrong 3 times or you loose your ledger, you can easily recover all of your wallets. It is suggested to buy a ledger directly from the ledgerwallet.com domain or from amazon, to be sure about the originality. I've read some reviews before buying it, this one seemed to be the most preferable one from all of them.

It usually takes a couple of hours. I did transfer BTC yesterday, I think it took aproximately 4-5 hours for me. But it really depends on the actual situation and the amount of the fee for the transaction.

On the blockchain you would still see the transactions you've made from or to your wallet. It can be seen by everyone there.

At the very least, you should calculate if it is worth for you. Based on my experience, buying and waiting is worth it for now, but noone can tell if it will be worth it in a week or a month, so it is mostly your decision.

Sure, if you will have some more questions about it, feel free to ask.

I just hope they do that after they improve their support response time and usability...
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:43:46
I would wait it out and that is what I will do.

Yeah, you don't need to worry probably. But next time be more careful
