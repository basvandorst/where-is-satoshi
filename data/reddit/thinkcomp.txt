This bill will pass in some form.
It is sponsored by Roger Dickinson, the chairman of the committee. It's important to understand that 99% of state legislators have no idea what the bills they're looking at actually say or mean, unless they write them themselves. They spend much of their time in hearings reading their e-mail on smartphones. Consequently, the trend is for everyone to vote the same way that the chairman votes, and when it's the chairman's bill...
I talked to Dickinson after the hearing and told him that what constitutes an "agent" for purposes of the new exemption needs to be clearer. (I tried to record the testimony at the hearing, and somehow the iOS Voice Memo app stopped recording in the middle before the bill came up. I'll check with the Assembly to see if there's any audio archive they can dig up, since none is publicly available, in typical Sacramento fashion.)

...and what about compliance with federal and state laws?
@_date: 2014-03-01 02:35:26
It's the role of state regulators to audit money transmitters to ensure "safety and soundness" as it's called in the trade. State regulators have been asleep at the wheel, but the laws are still on the books.
Like Mt. Gox, despite its nominal FinCEN registration, Buttercoin does not have any money transmission licenses, nor has it applied for any (to my knowledge) so it does not get audited, and it has no surety bonds as required by law.
Given that this is a violation of state (California Financial Code § 2003(o)) and federal (18 U.S.C. § 1960 + various BSA statutes) law, I've asked Kevin why below.
@_date: 2014-03-01 02:25:48
Hey Kevin. I see that you're registered with FinCEN but you have no money transmission licenses. Can you explain?
@_date: 2014-03-01 02:46:18
Whatever your personal opinion may be, the law makes no exception for virtual currency. That's clear.

What you should know is that the suggestion to repeal came from the Department of Business Oversight. Source:
This doesn't make Bitcoin "legal." It just stops making Bitcoin illegal, and paves the way for it to be regulated according to the Money Transmission Act, which is also being amended by AB 2209.
Also, the California regulators think that the New York regulators are "fools."

Actually, it's the committee chair, and it's a committee bill, so it's pretty much guaranteed to pass.
The bill is totally irrelevant in practical terms, though.
@_date: 2014-03-08 02:26:26
None of you, including Ron Paul, get it. Bitcoin is *already regulated* at the exchange level, and because it's regulated by states *and* the federal government, there's 47 times as much regulation there needs to be. If Ron Paul were actually someone who believed in free markets and minimal regulation, he would be first in line to federalize the current regulatory regime and eliminate the needless state statutes via Congressional preemption.
Of course, that's not the world we live in. The Tea Party wants to hear Ron Paul denounce government, and so that's what we get.

Your Bitcoin holdings are irrelevant unless you have dollars or some other fiat currency to back them up. Is your USD balance sheet audited? By whom? Will you disclose it publicly? If so, how often? If not, why not?

The regulatory situation:

The amendments to the statute were in large part due to my protests and the filing of the lawsuit. I testified at three hearings at least.
Also, the "new" agency is the same agency and the same people with different letters.

Phone calls are worthless. Ask for written guidance under California Financial Code § 2175. See what happens.

Because after all of the time and money invested (there's no way to predict that a judge will keep you waiting for 3.5 years; typical delay is 3.5 months) I wanted a federal judge to say either that the law was null and void or that there was a loophole in it large enough now you can drive an entire company through it. I got the latter.
Now corrupt regulators will have to think twice before issuing baseless threats against the company. And keep in mind that the cost of compliance with the corrupt law would have been many, many times larger than what the company paid in legal fees. It's a technical loss but a strategic victory. Of course, anything could still happen in the future.

FinCEN does not have the authority to pre-empt State law unless given such authority by Congress--which means that basically only Congress can pre-empt State law, except that Congress has already implicitly delegated its authority to the states!

The video record says "FinCEN;" there is no mention of New York in the video and you did not clarify in any way that you meant New York. The statement that FinCEN is sending out letters to Bitcoin businesses is further supported by this article:

Fred was under the mistaken impression that Coinbase's receipt of an inquiry letter from FinCEN was already public when he told the audience at Stanford Law School ( that it had been received. The fact that letters were sent is public; as with most financial regulatory inquiries, the recipients are not.

From Hacker News:
Interesting hand-waving going on here. For some reason they're citing the California Commercial Code when they know full well than FinCEN Guidance FIN-2013-G001 ( takes precedence. Of course Bitcoin is a "payment instrument," that's the whole point, and the Department of the Treasury has already deemed that it is within the bounds of state regulators. Any semantic argument to the contrary is just ridiculous.
Also surprising that a reputable law firm wouldn't have known that as of July 1, 2013, the DFI no longer exists, and has been merged into the California Department of Business Oversight.
I'll be interested to see how the DBO responds, or if this comes up at the AB 786 hearing tomorrow.
@_date: 2013-08-26 00:35:36
The article and the headline are misleading.
Virtual currencies are already subject to money transmission laws in each state where they may apply. The question is not either-or with respect to additional virtual currency regulations, such as the ones being investigated by New York. The question is whether virtual currencies will be subject to money transmission laws AND additional regulations.

I've been in touch with Congressional staffers. They're not convinced that there is anything wrong with the current patchwork of 47 state money transmission laws. We need to explain what's wrong, and why we think a federal system would be better.
Much like Bitcoin, it's a numbers game. The more who sign, the greater the chance that Congress will listen.

From Hacker News (
Most of the comments here are not particularly well-informed and should be ignored.
Yes, the Bitcoin Foundation (probably--I don't know anything about them other than what I've read) isn't strictly speaking a money transmitter. Yes, the California Department of Financial Institutions--which will cease to exist in 7 days when it gets merged into the California Department of Corporations--is totally ignorant of Bitcoin. But they know the law pretty well. Especially the one that they wrote. (See the name Robert Venchiarutti on the letter? He's really the one behind it. The DFI lawyers just do what they're told. They don't even like the law. Venchiarutti actually wrote it, with the help of TMSRT's lobbyists.)
That being said, the law to worry about here isn't even the one cited. It is, as I've stated quite frequently, 18 U.S.C. § 1960 ( And that law says that you don't have to be a money transmitter to get a letter such as the one received by the Bitcoin Foundation (
"(a) Whoever knowingly conducts, controls, manages, supervises, directs, or owns all or part of an unlicensed money transmitting business..."
The question then becomes whether the Bitcoin Foundation has any "control" or "direction" over its members and/or affiliates, who are most clearly in violation of the law under section (b). These words are vague. It could be argued that it does.
There is an extremely high chance that people will go to jail over this whether people here think it's stupid or not. It's too bad no one took me seriously when I pointed out that the MTA was going to cause problems two years ago. I've been doing the industry's dirty work ever since. It would have been a lot faster and easier with some help. Now we all have to hope that my constitutional challenge ( is going to save the day. And it might, but that day may be pretty far off in the future at the current rate.
Meanwhile, everyone should really be freaking out over AB 786 ( presently before the California Senate, which makes the MTA worse than it already is by giving Robert Venchiarutti even more power. I've been successful in removing the clause that created a new thought crime, but the rest is still pretty bad--unless you're a payroll company. Amazing what lobbying can do.
If you want to help, click on the "Comments to Author" tab at the link above, register with the State of California, and tell Assemblyman Dickinson that the MTA should be repealed for all of the reasons I outline at  its overly broad scope, inability to sensibly regulate mobile technology, and unconstitutional nature. Money transmission takes place over the internet, which is in the domain of the federal government, not the states. See /ALA v. Pataki/, 969 F.Supp. 160 (1997),  Also CC: Eileen Newhall &lt;eileen.newhall Mark Farouk &lt;mark.farouk Senator Jerry Hill &lt;jerry.hill Marc Hershman &lt;marc.hershman and BCC me: Aaron Greenspan &lt;aarong If you live in California make sure to say where.

In 2001, I took a freshman seminar at Harvard on facial recognition with Ken Nakayama in the psychology department, which was a broad overview course, but I learned about a condition called prosopagnosia and eventually developed the web site for their research lab ( When I was thinking about a project to start in 2008, it seemed to me that faces should be able to be used for something both useful and productive (the opposite of Mark's version of Facebook), and so I built a more secure payment system around an insight that is basically the opposite of prosopagnosia: a small number of inidividuals are so terrible at recognizing faces that they have to use clothes as a proxy for identifying individuals, but that means that the vast majority of people are excellent at recognizing faces with extremely high accuracy. Why not put that to work in the payments context? So that's what FaceCash is.
