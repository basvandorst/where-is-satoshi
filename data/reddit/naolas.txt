What you actually want is BIP 32, a deterministic way to generate a stream of addresses. You lock in the "master public key" and receive bitcoins to new addresses each time. Since you know the "master private key", you can receive them all.

Uhm, no https, even for the signup? People enter CC details in these forms?
And if you enter the https manually, the certificate is faulty.
(it's the same on mofos.com)

Did you have enough funds?
@_date: 2014-02-15 13:44:05
Very likely internal.
@_date: 2014-02-23 21:30:35
That's normal.
Edit: Just make sure to reply in their support system to make sure it is not some phishing email.

Seems unrelated to bitcoin.

I could see them requiring 1 confirmation right now due to the malleability issues.

Give it a day. There is a chance he may be spot on. ;)

Anyone doing arbitrage has long bought their coins. What you see now is speculators having fun.
@_date: 2014-02-21 16:54:45
I would not expect anything before Monday.

Did you factor in currency conversion? 
Everytime an order from another currency executes they take about 2.5% (as part of the exchange rate).

Someone is buying on Gox :P
This is likely why you are waiting on your coins:
@_date: 2014-02-15 23:33:30
That's the reputation they always had.
Media will still quote MtGox (ever seen Bitstamp of BTC-e in the media?) and new people will still deposit with them. 
And yes, it is sad.

Everyone does. You can pay a hefty premium right now to get some out.
Like the previous posts mention:

Could have canceled at least  one of those to buy some cheap coins. :)

Not exactly what your are looking for, but you can buy goxBTC at a discount here:

Supposedly just to remove the old junk. Supposedly, again, there will be a new tweet soon.
@_date: 2014-02-23 19:02:11
There is not much he can do.
Your BTC just became GOXBTC.
@_date: 2014-02-20 18:04:20
And people wonder why they moved offices.
@_date: 2014-02-15 14:00:50
Only BTC will move out of there quickly. Fiat is still going to take months. That is why it is so bizarre that the BTC price is so low.
@_date: 2014-02-23 23:25:21
Well, kinda. Let's ignore fees for a minute and say we have $100. You can place a buy order for 1 BTC at $100 and another buy order for 10 BTC at $10. As soon as the $100 buy order gets executed, the other $10 buy order is automatically canceled because of insufficient funds.

Well, I am assuming it was disabled for the maintenance, which is currently underway.

You also need to consider that the "attack" is extremely long term if it is for the generated coins only. The difficulty only changes every 2k blocks, so that an attacker would still generate blocks at the same rate until it is adjusted. Essentially, the attack would invalidate mining effort of a large part of the network and cause the difficulty to drop. Only after that would the attacker benefit. We are talking probably more than a week here, because it would take the attacker longer to find those blocks if a large part of the network isn't effectively mining.

Just the usual weekend drop. No incoming moneys because of lazy banks on weekends.
