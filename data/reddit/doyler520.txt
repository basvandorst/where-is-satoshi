Exactly, there’s a reason why you never see people pumping and dumping large corporations; because they just can’t. With enough money you may have been able to drive down the value of Bitcoin when it was at a market cap of $10 Billion, but now it is just getting to large to do that.

Congratulations! I hope this is just one of many dreams you achieve.

Exactly, and we should be glad this happened when Bitcoin was only at $11,000. This would have been a lot worse if Bitcoin was at $50,000 or $100,000.

I know lol Bitcoin is only down 9% and this whole sub thinks this is 1928 all over again. Netflix is down 5.5% today and you don’t see Netflix investors panicking. Plus the market cap of Netflix is roughly half of Bitcoin’s.

I know I have my doubts about it too. If this was real he would have lost his money some time in the future anyways. I mean someone who thinks putting all of their money into one thing is going to lose it one day or another.

Exactly, financial institutions won’t get scared until Bitcoin has a market cap in the trillions and a change in value less than +/- 1% a year.
