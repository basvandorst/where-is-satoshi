What does HODL stand for?

Good for you man. I listened to my father when it was 2.5k and he said it was an unhealthy market and to just avoid it. I regret not investing earlier

It crashed for me

I've only ever invested what I can afford, but being a student I invested late and little. I missed the opportunity from reluctance and lost my free chance that I was too afraid to do this. I have my father to blame for that. He, someone with experience in the stock market, told me to back out of it and it was a false economy. I believed him. I regret it.

So you think the reason it isn't in use at the moment is due to it's low (but rising) popularity? If you understand bitcoin you understand its value

Wasn't this a skit?
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:37:21
I know. But its still annoying to hear
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:27:16
Yeah, but it stayed within that swing. Didn't go higher or lower

The hardest thing to deal with besides the crash: people saying 'I told you it would crash'...

Crypto is falling. Fiat stays strong. There is no hope of escape. We are trapped.

Bought in at 10k. Im officially in the negatives.

The hype bubble popped. But the ride ain't over yet

Remember when bitcoin was super stable for 3 years around 400-700. Good times
