He donates some every year and has donated about a 1/4 of his net worth so far and will donate whatever is left when he dies.

He invests based on cash flow, not based on what other investors might pay. He hates gold for the same reason.

For a lot of people that aren't tech savvy, they're probably safer holding their money at coinbase.

He's the best investor of all time, lives relatively frugally, and donates 99.9%+ of his wealth to charity. What's not to like?

Bitcoin can never be fully stopped, but I personally would sell all my bitcoin if the govt said all bank-bitcoin transactions are going to be blocked. I have no interest in skirting the law and meeting some random on the street to exchange btc for cash to possibly make money. Banning bitcoin would have devastating effects to its usage. In Colorado, weed use roughly doubled after it became legal. Tons of people don't want to intentionally break the law and risk jail time for almost anything.

I think if you had 100% of the supply, it would become worthless. Not sure though.

Maybe this? I can't read the article though.

There's counterparty risk if one wants to buy or sell bitcoin though. Just no counterparty risk to hold if one chooses.

One of his investment managers did, so his company did but he had no hand in the decision. He has two guys that run 10B portfolios for him.

He understands enough about bitcoin to know how it's valued. It's valued based on what other people pay, which is different than cash flow. Buffet hates all investments like this, eg. gold.

Rich people mostly just talk about finances with other people they already know have money. I imagine lots of bitcoin people are just talking about it with randoms.
@_date: 2019-06-24 04:47:09
You've specified random risks other asset classes face, but not holding bitcoin. First, default and counterparty risk is a ridiculous complaint for bonds in terms of comparing to bitcoin. Most rich people don't just buy one bond, they buy lots of bonds. There's no real risk long term if properly diversified. Basically a non-issue compared to the possibility that bitcoin collapses if wealth preservation is your goal. 
You also failed to mention most wealthy people invest in stocks which don't really face any of these issues long term, if properly diversified.
Bitcoin has significant risks of holding: hacks on their holdings, 51% attack, other potential bugs, not insured, political/legislative risks, etc. If a wealthy person wants to sell significant bitcoin, they now have counterparty risk. Jeff bezos knows if he has billions in amzn stock, it's literally unhackable.

Can't you just trade tether for btc on binance and tons of other exchanges?
@_date: 2019-06-17 17:04:42
If I'm understanding right, it's going to be used for a binance stable coin backed by bitcoin, which in an efficient market would reduce demand from actual bitcoin. It should in theory be a wash, other than the ripple effect of increased usability of bitcoin that increases its value.
A different example, if coinbase knows that customers will always hold at least 100k bitcoin on the coinbase server, then pulls 100k out of circulation "forever", that act in itself hasn't increased prices, as the 100k bitcoin buyers holding on coinbase represents buyers that won't be buying to hold in their own wallet.

Instead of making himself comfortable, he'd rather donate it all and make others comfortable.

Because you wouldn't go to great lengths to maintain anonymity, then decide to reveal yourself by copyrighting some document. Satoshi is seemingly a mulit billionaire, and having the copyright on that paper should be almost meaningless in value compared to his worth. If he was gung ho on proving it was him for some reason, he could just move a coin from his wallet. If he was Satoshi, copyrighting the paper now makes 0 sense.

I log in to all my accounts, disable 2 factor, install Auth on new phone, enable 2 factor on all accounts, wipe old phone. Not ideal, for sure. I think I backed up my Auth restoration codes in a password manager this time though.

0.5 btc not worth worrying about for a will, imo, but I guess it depends on a variety of factors. Most people in that balance range are probably fine with some written down instructions or something.
@_date: 2019-05-24 17:03:44
You're supposed to maintain a desired allocation. Same with something like a 90/10 stock/bond allocation. If stocks double and bonds remain flat, you're supposed to sell some stocks and buy back some bonds. What the desired allocation should be, is up for debate.

He understands how it's valued. It requires other people to invest for the value to go up. Just like gold. He hates both. He wants investments to be intrinsically valuable. Like if he was the only one on the planet interested in buying an investment, it'd still be smart. It doesn't matter if everyone sells coke stock, as long as people keep buying coke, he'll still get a healthy dividend, and eventually people will figure out coke stock is valuable if he decides to sell at some point. That's not how gold or bitcoin work which is why he thinks they're bad investments. 
His timeline is also huge. His favorite holding period is forever. Not sure how bullish people are, but if someone told me I had to hold bitcoin or the s&amp;p500 for 50-100 years, I would pick the s&amp;p500. Too many unknowns with bitcoin tech.

Imagine you had to own the entire coke company forever and could never sell. All the profits coke earns is yours now. They currently pay a dividend and reinvest some of the money, but you'd get all the profits to do as you see fit. It doesn't matter if you can never sell, it obviously has value. Intrinsic value tries to figure out a fair price to pay for all of coke's profits now and forever, if you assume nobody would ever buy again. In theory, that should be market value if the market is efficient, but obviously people will have different estimates of that future profit.
