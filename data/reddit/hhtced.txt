Yeah I sold at $100 thinking itd never go that high again. Only recently started looking back into it.

.0087 here, and i got in in 2010 (and out at $100)
@_date: 2017-08-17 00:21:04
That's what I said first time it hit $100.
It still burns, all these years later.

I just smoke my lawn trimmings personally, but not everybody can be as fiscally responsible as me.

How Can It Be Real If Our Eyes Aren't Real

I cashed out my btc when it was worth 100 bucks per coin. Should have had my head examined.

I think I'll try this then as well. I'm suprised the CUDA miner actually works as well as it does for litecoins on an Nvidia card. (other GPU miners, if they even worked, would only generate 7k/hash a second; CUDA miner is anywhere from 75-375, though usually averages around 150) 
I didn't know the exchange rate was so good, I think this will be my new method of gaining BTC. If I had and BTC to tip, or reddit for gold - I went send it to you, hopefully this upvote will suffice.

Oh I know I won't make much at all. I'm just trying to find a site that other people may know of its legitimacy. A lot of these sites seem pretty damn shady, and while I'm willing to slave to pennies; I'd rather not go in blind, if you know what I mean.

I have my GTX 580 mining 24/7, and spent all of my free time watching ads for .00000086 BTC each. I have earned 0.019 total in 4 days of this, and am starting to think my goal of a coin before I lose the ability to mine is looking dim. Does anybody know of an actual, reliable decent paying way to work online for BTC? I have no services to sell, only time and my ability to perform mundane, repetitive tasks for hours on end without getting bored.

I work in surgical pathology (13 an hour). My wife is enlisted (read: also makes shit money). We have two kids of our own, and one from a previous marriage whom I pay child support religiously too. 
I can continue to divulge embarrassing, personal information to answer your snobby remark if you'd like, or maybe you can just answer my fairly simple one instead.

Thanks, ill check it out.

The fact I graduated college and work full time dissecting human organs and doing autopsies for the same wage as a Burger flipper is also a valid explanation. Not every city has a booming job market.

That's essentially what I'm doing as well (minus the cool rhymes)
People here have told me its a "stupid idea" to use BTC as an investment. Personally, my gut feeling is that BTC will explode, and forever alter the way we, not as a nation - but as a world. It could be the miracle developing.countries need. 
Call me an optimist, but I will continue to mine my 0.000035 or whatever I get out of my GTX580. (Can't convince the wife to buy another video card for mining, it's hard to justify when every bill cant even be paid despite both of working. Daycare is a motherfucker. Sorry, I ramble.)

Thanks, should keep me busy. If I can tip painfully small amounts (.001 is still massive for me) and I knew how to do it, I would

I'm not sure why you people are assuming I am not already working as much as possible. I am not looking to supplement my income with bit coins. I just simply cannot put any form of money into any form of savings. 
This is why I am now so obsessed with BTC. Its an investment I can afford. These fractions of BTC I'm collecting today in my free time might be worth more in the future, and I already regret not jumping on bored when I was young and my priorities weren't focused on anything but the present. I don't want to regret it again, so even if its a couple of cents I dont care - next time I won't regret not even trying.
