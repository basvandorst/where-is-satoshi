@_date: 2017-12-22 03:24:21
you have the right mentality to make money in this long term
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:27:14
yo make x4 times my income, maybe you want to donate to me so i can reach my goal of 0,1 BTC
then go fuck yourself
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:56:15
see you in 2 months when you buy for double the price
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:16:53
yes but i cannot control the fee in the exchange
so atm if i buy for example 100€, i am paying:
5-10€ for the transfer into the online wallet
3% for the exchange (in coinbase is even more)
5-10€ for the transfer into the offline wallet
so i pay 100€ and end with 80€, if i buy 50€ this is even more exaggerated, you end with 25€ if you pay for 50
this is huge for the casual buyer, they pay 50€ and they end with 25€ end they think is a total scam and never come again (actually happened to some of my friends, i don't blame them)
this need to be solved ASAP or bitcoin will never be used in the real world
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:56:22
there are free options in the market
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:01:37
i was going to buy 0,023 bitcoin, for the transfer it was 0,001  and 3% for the exchange, in total was almost 10%
then if i want to send it to another wallet i've to pay another 0,001 
@_date: 2017-12-09 08:25:51
thanks dude sounds good
@_date: 2017-12-09 11:10:54
nah coinbase is online exchange, you don't lose anything if you reset your phone or whatever
and yes a hundred out of every paycheck sounds good, low risk investment and a lot of fun
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:16:29
seriously this is needed ASAP
today i was going to buy 300$ worth of btc in the dip, after i see the fees are almost 10% i said fuck it, really stupid
@_date: 2017-12-01 13:42:52
hodl the door, hodlthedoor, holddoor, hodor
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:29:03
wait until you learn about altcoins whose technology is x10 times better than bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:29:44
get fucked, totally deserved
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:55:18

@_date: 2017-12-08 05:40:33

@_date: 2017-12-01 15:09:40
actually born without it :P
@_date: 2017-12-01 13:38:56
if bitcoin reach 1.000.000 i will post a video without left nut
@_date: 2017-12-01 04:45:02
pretty stupid to be all-in in any investment
@_date: 2017-12-02 10:14:00
a bubble hehe
@_date: 2017-12-01 13:23:24
i find day trading not very profitable since there's huge comissions plus it's highly luck-based but still fun to watch and learn
@_date: 2017-12-09 11:44:15
if someone can convert 300 in 3500 in 1 week why would he do it for you? and not for himself
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:33:04
maybe solve the issues before adding other coins?
@_date: 2017-12-02 10:22:45
eeeh totally not made up right?
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:26:10
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:19:55
are you sure?...
@_date: 2017-12-03 15:49:56
seems like 12k is a big wall, i doubt it will pass it before christmas
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:23:17
dont worry, hodl
@_date: 2017-12-03 15:51:30
i plan to HODL even if it drops to 2k, that only will mean i can buy more
HODL is my life, it's my passion
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:58:53
@_date: 2017-12-03 15:46:24
yes i do recommend, but dont panic sell it when the dip comes
HOLD until 2020 minimum
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:10:09
honestly this is the worst part about bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-03 15:53:58
no way
@_date: 2017-12-09 11:49:27
i mean, at least you learnt something
it's a good life lesson for only 300$, sorry for your lose
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:24:51
so how do they pay the miners?
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:22:16
always buy high and sell on the dip my boy
you're on track to make big money
@_date: 2017-12-02 10:00:29
as a non-US im very glad that i dont have to pay any student loans, getting a A+ education for free and free health care system is the only thing that make me not want to move to US
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:48:05
Now panic sell in the dip like a true nab
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:22:34
as someone who want to invest a small amount, should i wait for this correction? does it always happen? or just buy now
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:26:32
2k
