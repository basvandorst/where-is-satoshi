Will purchase it on Amazon once I can read it on the Kindle Paperwhite thanks jamesF0
It's not useable on the Paperwhite or regular Kindle devices so maybe not... Can we get even a rough draft version not prettily formatted or anything in normal Kindle format not print replica. Would love to read it on my Kindle and would open up the wider Kindle epaper market up for you...

Thoughts on an epub or mobi formatted release?

I'm in at 2k shares currently so happy that in the future when the real money flows back in in March or April we will be back up there I'm planning on it getting to at least 15k per BTC again in the not to distant future so just hold till you see your returns then you can pull out if your worried, personally I put in only enough that I'm not worried if I lose it all. But remember don't let emotion drive your decision.

I've started a business, 
But getting it from small freelance consulting DevOps Style side jobs that helps mildly pay the bills but it will never go past the trading time for money rat race.
Without being able to implement a useful service that truly add value to the world continually; I'm kinda sitting in the opportunity waiting room hoping for something that might allow me more time while I keep focusing on learning more and more all the time.
If I could get to a point where I had a passive income stream or reduced expenses enough to free up time to work on other things. That would allow for a direction change or shift from the current status quo.
But I'm not much of a hustler, nor am I willing to harm another well-being to improve my own.
Thanks for the criticism any input is better than apathy....

Sorry didn't mean to upset anyone just thought I'd try my luck, maybe be able to help secure me and my family \ friends future. Always wanted to own my own home clean and clear. 
Anyway I'm sorry for causing you to be upset. My apologies.

Bitcoin kinda self regulates, based on difficulty we just need to stabilize and start using it more for day 2 day  exchange of value though.
If Walmart or amazon/whole foods or Target or Publix decided they would use it. mass adoption / usage would increase.
If all the retailers use some common defined value aka the weighted  average based on all the top exchanges weighted on each exchanges trading size / value
Then all the companies can assign a USD value to the BTC payment needed.
Then more and more companies would  want to join in making BTC better.
