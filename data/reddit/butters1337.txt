Yeah there's nothing stopping it except the SEC and FTC, and equivalent agencies in other countries.  There is also a lot of legally mandated reporting that must happen in order to operate a market (stock exchange, commodities, futures, options, etc.) legally  in the US/Europe/OECD.
@_date: 2018-01-09 15:05:18
No because Bitcoin is unregulated. A supposed advantage of the thing.  There is nothing to stop market manipulation schemes.
@_date: 2017-12-31 05:28:16
Good thing it isn't a currency.
@_date: 2017-12-28 00:56:00
How exactly does one actually sell the 1,700 BTC to get the $25,500,000?  Are the big exchanges even capable of serving this kind of request?

This looks like an affiliate link.  Did you create this account just to scam?
@_date: 2017-12-28 07:24:32
So what stops me opening two accounts at GDAX and simply trading BTC back and forth to myself to give the appearance of rising prices (although I am not making money net)?

That one middle manager can prevent development on a technology across a rather flat company (compared to most) with hundreds of regional offices?
@_date: 2018-05-18 18:48:21
Right, but you realize you are expecting someone who does not like investing directly in commodities or currencies, has made a successful career out of NOT investing in those things, to like investing and recommend investing in what you're calling a commodity or currency?
@_date: 2018-05-04 02:00:48
USD is backed by the military might of the worlds most powerful nation.
Bitcoin is backed by ??

Buffett also puts similar derision on gold "investors".  So why does this sub, and bitcoiners in general, care so much what Buffett thinks?

Bitcoin isn't supposed to be an investment though right?  It's supposed to be a currency?

If it wasn't meant for him, why does it address him directly and why was it put up 5 minutes from his house, as mentioned [here](

Yeah there's a lot of FUD in this video.

The only thing dumber than speculating, is speculating on someone else speculating.

Yeah, he invests in Government bonds, what a bastard!
@_date: 2014-03-31 07:09:44
This is not a threat.  Banks and exchanges are now prohibited from transacting BTC into Yuan.
When it comes to choosing between BTC and Yuan, they're going to protect the Yuan.  Misunderstand this at your own peril.
@_date: 2014-04-04 22:16:25


So what?
@_date: 2014-07-02 21:39:57


Uh how do you invent viral marketing?
@_date: 2014-07-02 23:04:35
Ah so he claims to have coined the term.
@_date: 2014-04-04 22:17:29
No OP, you should sell any that you hold.  The charts have clearly broken now and BTC is trying to find a trading range in a much lower price point.
Just be aware at this point it has very little backing of any major Governments, and without which it will probably never become more than an 'underground' currency for buying weed.

Catch that falling knife.
@_date: 2015-01-04 08:07:40
People finally figuring out that this thing that they're speculating on actually has no value at all?
@_date: 2015-01-04 19:40:30
Rofl yeah, no credibility, except the world's largest and most advanced military by far with a clear history of using it to maintain their economic hegemony.

Except for all those times when a 5-day high RSI didn't lead to a bull market. But you don't hear about them because traders generally don't advertise their losses.

Self-seeking bitcoin analyst says Bitcoin is awesome. Stop the presses!
@_date: 2016-11-03 20:16:20
They're not trying to limit the BTC going out of the country, they're trying to limit the capital leaving the country, BTC is just another medium like CNY.  People flocked to Bitcoin because the Bank of China has severely restricted CNY leaving the country.
To limit the people using Bitcoin to get around the capital controls, all they have to do is shutdown the domestic exchanges, which is pretty easy actually.  Then the only alternative is to buy Bitcoin from foreigners with CNY... but who is in their right mind is going to sell $millions of dollars worth of Bitcoin only to get CNY which is trapped in China?
@_date: 2016-11-04 00:33:51
Yeah, but as I said at this stage of the game it's a very, very slow way to try and get your money out of the country :P
@_date: 2016-11-03 20:15:14
lol... running the traffic of 1 billion people through a sat link?

lol I don't have a dog in this race. Trump is a joke candidate to people from other Western democracies. 
But sure, Trump with a history in NJ including mob connections, who has refused to put his financial interests in trust while President and first policy is a tax cut for himself I am sure will not be corrupt.
@_date: 2016-11-10 20:42:28
Well no, they aren't.
@_date: 2016-11-03 23:11:31
But most of the coins already are in circulation (~16 million out of 21 million possible coins - 75% or so), so most people will get their coins by exchange.  As a medium of exchange (an ability to move capital out of China), Bitcoin becomes far less accessible if the only way to get them is by mining them yourself.

What about all the reports that Munchin, a Goldman Sachs guy who's dad was a Goldman Sachs guy, is the frontrunner for the SecTreas?

Bitcoin is just a nerdy gold.  Alt-right Austrian economics types have always been here.

Secretary of Treasury is actually more like 'Head Accountant' than 'Head Banker'.
Chairman of the Federal Reserve is the 'Head Banker'.

Unless the exchange makes off with your money.

Anecdotally, I have heard of a few traders at the IBs who have gotten into Bitcoin.  Because it is largely unregulated (save for AML provisions), it's a 'free market' with plenty of opportunity for arbitrage and finding inefficiencies.
@_date: 2013-12-05 13:10:09
No.  They've banned existing financial institutions and payment systems from dabbling in Bitcoins.  They know they can't stop businesses from accepted payments for products and services in Bitcoins, and they aren't trying to.
@_date: 2013-12-05 12:57:09
They probably have all their guanxi setup by now anyway...
@_date: 2013-12-05 13:03:44
Bought into?  Doubt it.  It just means that they'll allow their web content to be monitored and censored by the government as needed.
