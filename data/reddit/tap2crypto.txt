Maybe, he is giving a rough figure based on the userbase at Crypto Exchanges. Whether user is active or not.

But if people are not allowed to change crypto to fiat, then no new trader will enter into the crypto market.

@_date: 2018-07-14 13:52:56
Blockchain done ! Really? What the f**k you are talking about? Still even technological companies don't know "What is Blockchain?" and the potential of Blockchain 
@_date: 2018-07-14 05:16:40

@_date: 2018-07-14 14:08:26
Exactly. Even people from field like IT and finance , don't know what is Cryptocurrencies.
@_date: 2018-07-14 05:24:30
Be patience, Blockchain is still in it's infancy.��

@_date: 2018-07-14 05:17:13

No, why you think so?��
@_date: 2018-07-01 11:42:26
Wow !!
Bicycle that is too small and capable of carrying a full man.
@_date: 2018-07-14 13:47:57
Okay... keep it that simple (&lt;10%)?
Still there a lot of people who have never ever used it in any form.
@_date: 2018-07-06 04:50:03
Yeah !! That's a f**king big problem. Twitter must do something. It's like a virus which outbreak at every Tweet of exchanges/influencer. "Decontaminate" !!
@_date: 2018-07-14 05:23:39
I think it's depends on userbase. Now looks at the total number of Crypto holder.
@_date: 2018-07-14 13:35:50
Maybe.... that's depend on person to person.��
@_date: 2018-07-14 13:53:28
Yes, of course !����
@_date: 2018-07-17 14:44:23
Betraying own coin. Now it's look like he will take a quick exit from Litecoin Foundation. And maybe he already sold all his LTC.
@_date: 2018-07-24 16:53:31
Almost balanced !��
@_date: 2018-07-14 05:26:44
In April this year.
