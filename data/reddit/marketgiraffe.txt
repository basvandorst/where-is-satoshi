did u see what happened to btc - e. the Feds can shut down an exchange at any possible moment and you are fucked. If you have any significant amount of coins the hardware wallets are chump change. just buy one. its also cool to be deeper in this technology and learn more about it.

Hey OP someone was asking me how the 21 million bitcoin cap stays true if miners are getting bitcoins to mine. I wasn't able to explain it to him. Where do these mining coins come from?
@_date: 2017-08-02 07:15:44
did you not pay attention at all these last 4 weeks about how the 1st is the worst time to transfer coins. hope it works out for you man.
@_date: 2017-08-02 05:02:48
bitcoin is legal. I'd suggest withdrawing a little at a time ($1000-$4000) instead of the whole 20k at once

Absolutely fucking not. Keep that to yourself bro.

i'm not saying they don't know i'm saying most of them aren't interested. I'd love to find a girl to talk about stocks and swing trading with. Unfortunately they are probably 1 in every 1000 girls who are interested in it and its not because of men, its because they simply don't give a shit. Go ask every girl you know to open a GDAX and Robinhood account put money in, then get back to me with the results.

Should i sell my bmw and put it all in btc eth and ltc? I usualy just use my skateboards anyway
@_date: 2017-05-25 08:40:41
I have 2. Selling as soon as they are available and then regret it and buy back in higher and then the price will crash causing me to lose the gain plus some of my initial investment.

@_date: 2017-07-24 04:16:11
this is a strategy people use my good sir. and its completely legit. The main risk I see is losing your coins in the transfer due to a hack or bad exchange service

Yea thats true i never really take bad losses but i also never really have good gains, except these past two weeks when coinbase forces me to hold since it takes so long to get these coins

10% isnt a crash its just another random ass tuesday
@_date: 2017-05-24 04:41:13
This is what i do. Waited 5 years to buy it at 2300 instead of $30
@_date: 2017-05-26 21:29:07
oh i see. thanks
@_date: 2017-07-21 01:47:09
I didnt sell. Just gunna baghold i guess

Girls suck at investing or trading. I only know one chick that does that stuff and she works in wallstreet. Insanely good at math that one.
@_date: 2017-07-24 04:10:17
does this apply to other coins that aren't bitcoin?

FUCKKKKKK now i want popcorn. weird how someone can just say that and then you want it
@_date: 2017-07-21 01:26:25
i fomo yolod after the dip at 2800 thinking it was going to bounce again and destroyed all my profits from the day. Typical for me tho. I'm pretty upset and will begin drinking now
@_date: 2017-07-02 15:57:17
Nice man. Yea i practiced with codecademy.com and used udemy/udacity to learn xcode. But then when i tried to get into a program called Hackreactor is just blew my mind. Not sure if my brain is meant to work like this. Good luck though dude!

@_date: 2017-07-20 23:33:26
i wasn't supposed to but i fomo bought too. was waiting for that dip to come in. got in at 2900, 2800, and 2750. now one can only hope it doesn't swerve from here

this is honestly super pathetic man, you should probably stay out of crypto.

Panic selling at 2800 last time would have been a really good decision. Especially if they bought back in at 2000 after.
@_date: 2017-07-23 15:43:00
Whhaatt. None of my dealers accept any crypto. They are super gay tho
@_date: 2017-06-29 22:48:43
i actually suggest you take some anti anxiety medication. I worried about the future a lot before too, and of course always thought of my mistakes in the past. Thinking too much about the past and future make you unable to live in the present. 
If you still have these thoughts then buy guns, shit loads of ammo, and most importantly a shitload of water and food.
@_date: 2017-06-30 15:40:27
You can, but you have to be very disciplined to stick to your strategy. I lost discipline twice and got too cocky after seeing an astronaut on the moon with a lamborghini and wiped out a $4000 and $6000 profit (both seperate times) and now i'm barely back to $1500. My rules are now:
1. No fucking yoloing, always have some cash to be able to buy fatty dip.
2. No transactions of $3k or more at one time
3. If i make $1000 in one day thats it for the day.
4. If i'm waking up in the middle of the night to check price i'm in too deep, sell until comfort
5. Get a job. Any job. To buy more crypto.
If i break those rules i'm very likely to lose money. Good luck dude.

because cash doesn't go down in value as quickly. It also doesn't go up as quickly but i hate losses more than I like gains.
@_date: 2017-06-09 03:58:08
Actually i might do this. Good idea thanks
@_date: 2017-06-15 05:22:21
Holy shit you have a gf? Dude.. i fucking hate you now
@_date: 2017-06-30 10:03:08
As soon as you buy it will tank hard so stay out and watch it go up.

Yea if you are good you can get similar returns with 5k in the crypto exchanges as you could with 25k in wallstreet. You can also lose it all because theres no regulations protecting you either. Congrats and welcome to the wild west of finance.

uhh yea i didnt even think of taxes. there aren't any regulations here though so how are they even going to find out if someone made any or lost any in the virtual currency exchanges?

@_date: 2017-06-09 04:49:52
I live in a place where it probably matters but i'm planning on only withdrawing a very little at a time every other week to not raise any suspicion. I know a guy that was getting paid over wire transfer about $500 every other week for part time work and he never paid any of his taxes on that. That was even more risky than this
