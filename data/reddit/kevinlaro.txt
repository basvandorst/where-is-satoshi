nope but recently somone pointed a lawsuit in his direction concerning bitcoin I just think that maybe he's trying to get a different public image.
@_date: 2014-01-13 13:42:13
The lawsuit just got on his desk.

If you have physical gold and silver try Kitco.com or @_date: 2015-01-13 16:19:35
Yes but it has to be done on other sub. If you only do it in and not ,you wont gain much.

I turned about 600 in about 10k cause I wanted buy a car. I pulled everything on the 31st of December against my will, (really needed a car) now I'm quite happy that I was strong armed into selling. Especially since I bought a 1k car and I'm studying investment option with the leftovers
@_date: 2015-03-17 19:08:58
I need some to get to the trouble of setting up a wallet
@_date: 2015-03-03 00:36:43
You now have some slave, welcome to the elite !
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:22:05
they're capping the bitcoins at 21m right ? 
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:54:11
How do you find those block and how do you start mining ?
@_date: 2013-11-18 23:14:35
Thanks, I'm waiting for my dad to find the back up files, I told him if I find those I pay the house he just bought (about 100k left to pay from selling old one)
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:01:41
Whaty's the principle behind mining ?
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:36:09
So it wouldn't really change any thing if the cap is already achieved.
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:59:12
garbadge or familly member, I don't know.
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:49:53

@_date: 2013-11-18 22:59:54

@_date: 2013-11-20 05:14:16
Not yet, my dad hasen't found any back ups yet.
I was able to check on my brother laptop and no file name wallet.dat was found. 
It may be on a old gateway laptop I pawned for rent back in the days, making the most expensive rent ever paid for a month :/
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:42:30
I'll try to, but a 516 MB/ram 10 Gig memory computer doesn't last very long. 
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:40:37
