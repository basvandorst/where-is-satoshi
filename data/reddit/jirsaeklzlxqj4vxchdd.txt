If BTC goes below the 21 weekly average in the current downtrend i believe we could move towards 3k.When you look at MACD it does look like the steam is running out of the over all uptrend, so imo we should atleast go touch the 21 EMA maybe even the SMA.

I like gold too but i the supply is not that limited when you look into it.
Also if/when asteroid mining takes off at some point the gold supply will be almost unlimited.

Thanks for the time stamp.  
wow he has a good point about moving money from EU where we have a negative interest rate to UK and USA where they don't. This seems so stupid of the EU it can't be a coincidence. I'm thinking the UK kinda needs this for a Brexit. damn my conspiracy mind \^\^
