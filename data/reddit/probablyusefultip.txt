He made all of this story just to take my coins and that's it? So much effort just for my $200 of coins? Wow. And he knows $200 is all i have. So cruel of him!

This nice person kindly offered me a help to go out of poverty in a most efficient way he knows. I am honestly was very intrigued siince never in my life was offered for such a help. Unfortunately i have no idea about Bitcoins and things in this message means no clue to me. Can you guys please tell me if i am safe to proceed?

I almost did it. Here is the rest of the story (spoiler he is a scammer) 
@_date: 2018-08-31 09:41:07
I did a research and had nothing to find obviously. I was totally confused. Coming here was my last hope for answers. BUT - Some of you reported ME and now i can comment only once per 10 minutes. This is "great" guys. How on earth potential victims would find out if this a scam eventually? No wonder. It looks like the scammers sitting here protecting themselves in such a way. 0 upvotes and my account almost blocked. Way to go.

Not convincing for me still :) Because he stated that amount of invested coins matter to his business (more coins more profit and only 3 times possible to use one wallet as far as i understand it)+ he seems to trying to help me? But thank you for your point. I agree, this looks very suspicious. Why the hell anyone would help to anyone at all. Who do they think they are? A JESUS?
@_date: 2018-08-31 12:37:06
Yes i am. And it's fine.
@_date: 2018-08-31 11:47:17
And this is exactly why i posted here. Thank you. I need more opinions. Since yes i have no clue what i am doing and i believe many like me out there. They can read this and make decisions. 
And you can be rude. Its ok.
@_date: 2018-08-31 09:08:20
Can you also tell me how exactly he going to fool me here? Thanks.
@_date: 2018-08-31 20:45:34
That's why his profiles perfectly function since 2013. And they at least should be blocked.

i am not dumbest among others here (around me) and i was am totally confused with his message, no research will help  - only makes it worth. This is a scary situation. Because imagine how easy it is to full anyone if they almost did it with me? A bunch of technical jargon and woila you registering your first wallet account ever. You verifying it, you processing money to it from your bank. Ha. And you have no clue if it is a scam or miracle. Because all bitcoin a miracle all together to you, you see.
