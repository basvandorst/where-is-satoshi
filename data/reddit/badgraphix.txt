I realize, but if everybody's rushing to sell off their BTC, 1 Bitcoin could go from being 11590 dollars to like 8000 or something.

If everybody is competing to sell their BTC the price of it will go down and devalue the currency.

Ok, looking into the fees now, I can see why miners would want to continue mining. Instead of BTC being generated it's just being pulled from the pool of existing money basically.
I'm reading some articles and the transactions fees seem really high though. Is it going to stay like that or is there a plan in place to lower them?

You can handle cash under the table as well.

...The same way they do with the regulation of regular money? I'm not sure I understand the spirit of your question. All law is enforced with the threat of violence from the state. What makes Bitcoin different?

What is stopping the government from regulating BTC if they so choose to?

So does that mean if most US businesses suddenly stopped accepting US dollars as a form of payment, it wouldn't effect the value of the currency?
@_date: 2019-04-09 17:23:47
I mean, yeah. What else would it be used for? I have never heard of anybody suggest it be used for anything else.
@_date: 2019-04-09 17:16:15
If they forbid it businesses will not allow it as a form of payment, so yes it would work for the most part.

Why is there a difference? 
You say USD's only function is to be spent on things which makes sense to me, but you also suggest Bitcoin has a function other than that. What are these other functions? What about Bitcoin makes it have these other functions while a regular currency doesn't?

The same way they do with cash: a mix of self-reporting and IRS monitoring.

Yes, but doesn't a store of value require the thing in question to have value to people? If Bitcoin never takes off as a means of payment, won't it not have much value? I thought the whole idea of buying it in these early years was for the speculative value it may have in the future.

It's not free movement if the government of your country decides they want to tax you on it though.

That absolutely still sounds like a currency for me. Like, I agree that those are definitely worthwhile things about Bitcoin and contribute to its value, but I can't really see a use case for that kind of stuff *outside* of being used as a currency. If it was a way to communicate with people as well, then yeah, it's spending value wouldn't be its only function.
The way I'm seeing it after this discussion, its value would definitely tank at least a little bit if major countries tried to lock down its use. Less places accepting it inherently means less value.
However, due to it being such a global thing it would still retain value just as long as people in some places are using it. The same could be said about under-the-table cash if people felt the same way about it, but I presume they don't because the US government controls the distribution of it.
Does that sound right, or am I missing something here? It still seems like a pretty risky store of value right now.
