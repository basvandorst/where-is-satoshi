A few years ago I went to buy a video card. Prices were through the roof, but the salesman said it was good for mining Etherium, so I said ok can I pay for it in Etherium and he said no.  Kind of ironic and sad, but maybe if people ask if they can pay in crypto eventually merchants will adopt it.

'Buy a Lambo because you're good at investments' 
Easy come, easy go, had a few laughs along the way

I remember around then is when I became interested, and I tried to get on an exchange but got jerked around by registration etc. Eventually I went to an ATM and was pissed at the 10% service change. Exciting times.

Sounds like you don't need a loan. Just buy $1000 worth of BITCOIN every month.
Good luck getting into the 21 million club!

If you were buying Bitcoin, then using it straightaway to buy goods and services, it wouldn't really matter too much.
@_date: 2019-07-31 01:14:53
That's true. I bought some ages ago and forgot about it until recently. I got a pleasant surprise to see it was worth more. THEN I got a bit too smart and tried to day trade, lost some Bitcoin. Lesson learnt, buy, hold and use it to buy goods and services only, don't sell.

Getting hounded by the taxman who wants his cut for your risk and investment would spite me enough to do it! Maybe if I had heaps of money and no family.

In greed we trust. If true, bitcoin will go up.

Thanks for the advice. I think I just bought some of yours.
@_date: 2019-07-14 05:55:34
Trust. Trust that's it's worth something. Just like the USD.

Those notes are pretty good for investment. I bought the biggest one (100 trillion) on ebay for about $10 a few years ago, now they sell for about $100.

Each dip helps me get to my Bitcoin target.

Grab some and sell on ebay. I like to collect this sort of thing.

A guy at my dad's work was very interested in Bitcoin and talked about it for at least a year (but didn't know how to buy or sell or anything). I took it upon myself to show him how to get going on an exchange and set up a wallet- all the technical stuff, purposely didn't talk it up or speculate. All my other friends and family aren't interested or think it's a scam or has no intrinsic value.

It's scary the first few times when you send. Those fees: transfer speed are a bit eratic. I've set it fast and it's taken longer, than other times when I set it at the absolute slowest I could. Just got to have faith and trust in the system.

Thanks for pointing this out. When I logged into my Blockchain wallet a while ago I saw I had Bitcoin and Bitcoin cash now. Whats best to do with Bitcoin cash???
@_date: 2019-08-05 22:43:50
Yup, those Zimbabweans should have 'hodled'
@_date: 2019-08-05 20:28:26
I bought one of those Bitcoin coin medalians too. I'm going to mount it on a sign that says ' accepted here' and leave it at work to prank the boss and colleagues.
@_date: 2019-08-12 02:54:35
How common are the 50,000? They seem to be going for $25 US on ebay
@_date: 2019-08-03 12:28:40
Thanks, I moved my Bitcoin out ages ago, but that Bitcoin cash had just been sitting there this thread reminded me of its existence!
@_date: 2019-08-15 09:08:24
Probably best not to say exact numbers. But, It's pretty low, just enough to get something nice if it shoots up and not enough I am going to cry over if it doesn't pan out!

Only the genuine 100trillion are worth anything. There are a lot of gold plated copies and other parifinalia.  The billion denominations aren't worth much either.

Interesting and good luck to you. Not a huge problem if you know what your doing. Even if it doesn't boot up anymore or have errors.
I once got keys off a hard drive that had been overwritten with Linux.
But yeah what the others are saying. You might also try connecting an external monitor via the HDMI or VGA port on the laptop.

I'd do it. I speculated way back with a few hundred, now have a thousand or so. Thinking of offloading and buy a car. Seems like a good out come since I consider myself neither lucky or greedy.
