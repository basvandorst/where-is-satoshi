They have no duty to do such a thing. It is a service that they get paid for, not an obligation.

Wells Fargo can't be forced to do business with Bitfinex.

Yeah, if they were paid for a service they would generally need to provide it.

I'm not a lawyer, but I have worked professionally managing wire transfers for goods and services internationally. Banks have the right to decline your wire transfer for any reason. I have never heard of a lawsuit that forced a bank to accept a wire. I have seen successful lawsuits when there was negligence on the bank's part(bank error), but nothing like this.
I did some searching around on this case because I found it interesting. In reading the suit they don't reference any particular case law. The suit says that the bank declining the transfers hurts Bitfinex's business, but that is it. There is no mention of an obligation for the bank in a particular law or agreement. There are plenty of examples of banks refusing transfers though. For example Islamic banks do not allow transfers to/from casinos, bars/club, or other gambling locations. That is legal and seems to be on point here. This suit will likely be dismissed.

These guys are funded by the same folks that fund Superfish. They are [tracking]( bitcoin use. You might want to be cautions.
