You own something.
The price of that doubles.
The value of the thing you own is now worth 2x as much.
WTF does compound interest have to do with that??

Sadly you are correct. The NY Times recently ran an article [Safe Deposit Boxes Aren’t Safe]( -- apologies if it is paywalled, I'll try sum up the important bits below.








There are a couple of heartbreaking stories in there; a watchmaker who's personal collection of rare watches vanished, estimated at over $10 million. That was the bank's fault. They drilled the wrong box and put the contents in storage. When the contents were recovered from storage many things were missing.
Also a couple who rented a box to store jewelry and other valuables. They paid for a 1 year rental -- 9 months later their box was empty. Similar story as above -- it was the bank's error. They sued and a jury awarded them $4.5 million. BUT




The article notes:

Thank you for that!

I predict that after "The Halving" (which btw I think could be the next M. Knight Shamalamadingdong film) just ONE BTC will be worth ONE HUNDRED MILLION SATOSHI!!

If you do not report having crypto gains (when you did) it could be a mistake. If they find out you'll have penalties to pay but it doesn't rise to the level of fraud.
If you lie on this question and the IRS discovers you *did* have crypto, you have committed fraud. Regardless of whether you have had any taxable gains. That can be subject to tax fraud penalties of 75% of the tax due (if any.) In addition the IRS considers it perjury, a felony with possible 3 years in prison and/or $25,000 in fines.

You realize this is on Schedule 1? If you don't have a need to file Schedule 1 (additional income or adjustments to income) you don't have to answer the question.
The IRS has made it clear that you do not need to file Schedule 1 solely to answer this question

You report capital gains or losses on gold on Schedule D and also on Form 8949, not Schedule 1.
If you don't need to file a Schedule 1 to report additional income or adjustments to income you do not need to answer this question

I have had good success (in the US) with CoinFlip ATMs as well. The fees are reasonable, although they are usually selling coin at an inflated price. For example, the ATM might say the fee is only $1.99, but look at the price; if the price of BTC is, say $8500, the CoinFlip ATM will be selling it at something like $9200.
Taking all of this into account, my last CoinFlip BTC purchase was $200 cash; after the transaction my Electrum wallet had ~ $189 in BTC at the prevailing rate. Still that's a 5.5% fee, which is not as bad as some other methods.
CoinFlip only requires a name and phone number to receive SMS texts if you are buying less than $900. (You will need to enter a verification code sent by text to proceed with the purchase.)

I absolutely have to file a Schedule 1. I don't recall saying that I did not.

I think it's pretty clear that you would have to check the box
@_date: 2019-10-30 03:26:20
No, you don't have to report the amount you bought, but you would need to check the box.
You only have to report the amount of capital gains realized. You only realize a capital gain if you sell or spend your crypto at a price higher than what you paid for it.

This is on Schedule 1, which you use to report additional income and adjustments to income.
If you do not have additional income or adjustments to income you do not need to file Schedule 1, and therefore do not need to answer the question.

There seems to be a lot to like about Bisq, except in order to buy bitcoin using Bisq . . . you need to already have bitcoin??
















So right now as I type, with BTC ~ $3,567 USD, you need to already have about $39.24 in BTC already (somehow) before you can start using Bisq? I can understand the need for a security deposit, but this is a little inconvenient for someone who only wants to buy a small amount (like $100) of bitcoin.
