How does one rename the alias of their node?
@_date: 2018-01-12 15:13:15
Just signed up. I’ll give er a go. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 02:31:40
Good point. I like where your head is at. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 23:06:16
Gotcha. Makes sense. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 02:35:24
I wish it was only $11
@_date: 2018-01-05 18:12:11
Ok Sally, take a chill pill.

If you were to mine an altcoin, you might have success. The problem is having only 1 supreme GPU if you were to get one.

What stops me from purchasing bitcoin, transferring it to a cold wallet and saying “I transferred it right away to a friend, or to pay for merchandise”. Then the gains really wouldn’t be there...
@_date: 2018-01-08 22:45:35
Where do you get your hands on an amount of GPUs in that quantity?!
@_date: 2019-07-12 03:01:33
A cold wallet is something that is disconnected from the internet. Could be a paper wallet or a Trezor. The safest way to hold your crypto.
@_date: 2019-07-12 03:03:14
No worries. Yo Rexy, just buy whatever amount and move it. You got this!
Edit: got OP name wrong

You’ll most likely lose money from electricity costs. Or burn out your system. 
@_date: 2019-07-12 03:13:18
And the point is?...... you have no understanding of Bitcoin? Ok, got it.
@_date: 2019-07-12 03:08:12
Victim my ass. Come on. I like the way you try.
@_date: 2019-07-12 02:55:52
Coinbase to start. Then move to your cold wallet.
@_date: 2019-07-12 03:00:09
Doesn’t matter how much. Early adoption. Just trying to help someone who finally caught the bitcoin flu.
@_date: 2019-07-12 03:09:08
You got it bro! Hit me up if you need help with anything.
@_date: 2019-07-12 02:58:53
What a douche canoe
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:11:08
I’m currently sitting at 14 hours. Fml
@_date: 2017-12-23 14:02:46
Use GDAX. Transfer your balance from Coinbase to your GDAX wallet (free) . Then transfer your coins out for free. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:56:58
I agree with this video. ^^^
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:24:53
What is prohibiting our states? I don’t get it. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:40:08
Good luck my friend! Not sure I would do the same but still, good luck!
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:24:37
It’s definitely making me feel uneasy. Meh whatever. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:42:46
Annnndddd.... I live in Wisconsin. Fml. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 14:57:42
I'm definitely ok with that. Just gotta trust in the coin. I'm hoping one day I can get a hardware wallet. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 03:30:20
For a beginner I would recommend buying rather than mining. Mining would cost more to operate unless they had unlimited free energy. 
Coinbase is a great start. I’m currently using Coinbase and love it. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 21:38:36
!RemindMe 2 days
@_date: 2017-11-22 04:30:32
Thank you! Can’t wait to sport this one off at work!
@_date: 2018-04-22 01:03:48
She got it on Amazon. 
@_date: 2018-04-22 06:23:12
Yeah, I definitely put two and two together. 
@_date: 2018-04-22 01:08:23
I really should be, but I don’t use my card all of the time. I forget.
