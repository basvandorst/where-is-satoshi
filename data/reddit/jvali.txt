This was actually only **one of the 64 iterations** SHA256 has in it. For longer byte arrays it might be 128 iterations or any multiple of 64. So not even close to the actual mining operation, which is probably way more than just trying to hash :)

I luckily had only 0.1 BTC at the time that Mt. Gox was hacked when I lost those. Still made me realize how fragile the system is, Mt. Gox was THE exchange back then. Never hold your bitcoins in exchange accounts for longer than necessary for trade.

huh, you might be right.

Well yes, unless you buy them some other way, like just paying someone in person to transfer the coins to some address you control, or mining some. Exchanges are good, because it's very easy to buy and sell.
Fun fact: There are thousands of forgotten bitcoin addresses with 50 bitcoins on them from year 2009, like this one:  , most likely it's controlled by no one, as the owner probably lost the private key after he mined that one block that gave him 50 BTC. They had 0 worth during the time, so many people just forgot about them and probably deleted all related software including saved private keys. Otherwise he would have sold them by now, or at least shown some activity, sold some, etc. (Just the fact that there are still thousands of similar 50BTC accounts shows that many of them are probably lost forever.). Imagine finding the private key about now with your 50BTC from 2009...

It doesn't have inflation built in, so it will not be that perfect. People will hold money instead of spending it, which is bad for economy.

I don't know, probably split to smaller chunks for harder tracking and someone is either hoarding them or have tried to cash out. If you figure out what was the mtgox adress(es) you can see all the history, because it's public.

Ok, wouldn't it to make more sense that bitcoin price goes up by this as it has less potential competitors? There will be no bitcoin ICO will there?
@_date: 2017-09-19 06:53:27
Exactly, bitcoin has any worth as long as people use it, if there comes some other currency that monopolizes the cryptomarket, then bitcoin becomes worthless.

Awesome, and that Nigerian prince is sending me the money any moment now!
@_date: 2017-09-17 08:39:36
Lol. The only reason bitcoin is that popular, is because they see it as easy way to make money on speculating the price (in FIAT) goes up. Most people don't give a damn how revolutionizing this is, paying by credit card is way simpler than handling this complex crypto shit with keys and decentralized validation of transactions.

Just keep them on your personal "account" with private key, that only you are aware of, it's most likely the safest.
@_date: 2017-09-19 05:39:33
You've never heard of mtgox? It used to be the biggest exchange where over 70% of all trades took place, one day it was just hacked, and "POOF!", everyone's coins and money gone, including my luckily very small amount of $100. Never keep your money or coins in an exchange for longer than necessary, even the biggest can fail.
@_date: 2017-09-01 12:09:30
this is so surreal situation I'm just speechless.
@_date: 2017-09-19 10:32:09
No, the exchange did (actually I have to correct myself) over 70% of the trading, but not all bitcoins were traded at all times. 


and reported eventually:

How? It's used in electronics, because its excellent conductor.
@_date: 2017-09-19 07:25:11
Um, no they can't. Just because their clients identify themsleves, doesn't mean the hacker will identify themselves. What coinbase would see in case of security breach is just a normal bitcoin transaction from their address to some random address, which no one knows who it belongs to. They can however have better security measures in place to stop such breach in the first place.
@_date: 2017-09-10 14:46:48
But transaction validation can take minutes to hours. So you just wait until its finally confirmed?
@_date: 2017-09-20 06:16:07
Read about them online, read about wallets, I'm not competent enough in the subject to give you secure advice, but private key is any number between 1 to 2^256. What ever key you choose, is yours, don't lose it, don't keep it in the computer, don't show it to anyone. If anyone randomly guesses it, you've lost your coins. Your public key and address can always be derived from private key.
@_date: 2017-09-10 12:10:39
How do these work? Are they expecting you to enter the private key?
@_date: 2017-09-10 13:39:31
So, how?

Also reference to Inception movie :)
