The reasons why I claim partial responsibility are:
* I read and agreed with the terms and conditions upon opening my accounts. 
* I know that crypto hacks happen frequently and factored that into my risk management strategy. 
* Crypto is not banking money that can be reversed. I know this and traded fully realizing that counterparty risk is very dangerous. 
* SInce crypto lives in a decentralized free market, I assume the risk of playing in this digital jungle. 
* Unfortunately, hacks are a very real variable in the crypto markets that  we need to acknowledge. Hacks happen often and they impact the price. 
That said, I know everyone has a different opinion and I respect that. As a pure strategy most of us can probably agree that a haircut with tokens is better than years of painful litigation.

I agree, I'm not advocating that the exchanges or the hackers shouldn't be accountable. I'm just saying that the compensation feels like the best plan and that I still assume partial responsibility for taking the risk.

You seem very confused so let me break this down for you really nice and simple. 
**Traders use logarithmic scale to measure % gains for ROI.** 
Do you want to know why the chart looks distorted? Because there is a MASSIVE difference in returns between +50,000% vs 35%. 
Right now if you buy bitcoin at $650 you can make a 35% return if we hit $1000. Now compare that to the 400% ROI a trader would make buying bitcoin at $200. 
Traders use charts to measure price action and ROI is our bottom line. If I make 100% buying at $1 and selling at $2, I make the exact same bloody returns buying at $500 and selling at $1000.

This statement led me to believe that you weren't a trader. Patronizing? You're the one who came in here on the attack. 
I would think that as a trader you would already know that trendlines can be drawn on both linear and logarithmic scales. Both charts have their own merits for TA. 
Do some research and you'll find general consensus that logarithmic charts are used to measure longer term trends. 
You're a bitcoin trader, great. This is all I do for a living, I trade crypto full-time. Our team has a proven track record of catching every major bitcoin and ethereum trade over the past couple of years. 
Listen, I really don't want to get in a pissing competition with you. Perhaps you can work on a less hostile approach when presenting a counter argument. 
We could sit here and argue all day but I think we're both likely making nice profits right now so perhaps our time would be better spent trading.

Yes, I agree with you that there is a huge difference with the liquidity needed to push a higher marketcap. 
I used the logarithmic scale as one of many tools in my arsenal. My trading strategy looks for multiple layers of confluence between price areas, technical indicators and fundamentals. 
There are magnet areas within a price range that if crossed can have the effect of accelerating $$ gains. The current bull trend is still healthy. Once it reaches the stage of going parabolic the price could easily accelerate and break $1000.

Logarithmic scale calculates price action according to % gains and is generally better at measuring long term trends. 
TA can be applied to both linear and logarithmic charts.

p.s. I didn't downvote any of your posts.

Very good points. :-)

Haha, true.

Although "should" doesn't specifically appear, similar words like "need" appears  5 times as well as this sentence...

They plan to also use that hashing power for some of their new products/services. I don't know the exact details cause they're keeping things quiet for now.

Everyone has a personal opinion that may or may not be true. That said, what's important is that our industry is getting more marketing exposure on bigger sites. 
Bitcoin is obviously the most secure and popular blockchain in the world. It's also been a great store of value and is the most liquid cryptocurrency.
