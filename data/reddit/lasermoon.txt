Whats that website?
@_date: 2017-01-01 05:28:07
It's more like satoshi used these kind if idea which were known before but noone had realized them yet
@_date: 2017-01-01 13:33:07
Ah kk. Because I'm also rather new and informed myself really in depth  before I purchased some. And now i use a paper wallet as cold storage , which gives me  the most compareable feeling to papermoney
@_date: 2017-01-04 16:57:31
Good observation but what does it mean?
@_date: 2017-01-05 08:58:32
Easiest is paper wallet  
@_date: 2017-01-19 07:29:19


Why not just make a new account?

Hey, so finally I'm going to invest a bit into bitcoins, sucks a bit that they went up by almost 100 in the last few days but I'm okay with that
It would be great if you can confirm that my following plans work
so I just stumbeld on bitaddress.org it seem like exactly what I'm looking for
is that site trustworthy??
my plan is to get a single wallet on that website, 
then i register on a place where I can purchase bitcoins, like coinbase and send some money with that online wallet to my public key i generated with bitaddress and keep both keys written down on a paper in my safe?
@_date: 2016-12-29 07:12:17
Price was never an argument to me. I didn't care because I thought bitcoin was just a speculative investment...
What got me hooked about bitcoin was when I understood how it works,  that it's a decentralised currency backed by maths and what that actually means

Ted Nelson's video got me hooked into bitcoin
@_date: 2016-12-26 01:41:44
great thanks I just watched this video  and I guess that's what you mean
@_date: 2016-12-26 09:32:51
What about bitaddress.org ??  I wanted to take this approach 
A software wallet is a bit too much effort for me right now
@_date: 2016-12-16 13:53:07
I can only help you out with the legal stuff.
So unless your government doesn't pass a law that forbids the usage it's safe and even then they don't really have a way to identify since it's anonymous

In germany u don't have to pay taxes for selling btc after holding them for 1 year i think

If internet goes down money will be our  last problem
@_date: 2016-12-26 21:16:57


oh i didn't know that , thanks! Initially i planned to use it as kind of a piggy bank where I keep adding money, thank you
@_date: 2016-12-17 02:15:36
Wow thanks so much. Basically awnsered all I needed.  
I just recently started to inform myself on bitcoins and I'm amazed how great and intelligent this system is set up. I don't see how this will not keep getting more influence and will probably get like 1 or 2 coins myself because I feel that once the next financial crysis happens the price could skyrocket
@_date: 2016-12-29 21:02:45
I think scalability is one of the biggest problems... with the number users and transactions increase the network will be slower and require more computing power. But I don't know too much details, would be nice if someone could elaborate more on this
@_date: 2016-12-16 23:24:21
Perfect awnser thx. So you can't even change passwords right?
Btw another question.. Isn't it super easy to harm the bitcoin project by just creating tons of "fake accounts" so the datablocks that are stored on every pc that runs the program gets super big. Or is that just not enough data and nit significant? 
@_date: 2016-12-31 00:28:45
i would say half of that is more likely since people most likely have wishful expectations

Once 1 bitcoin is worth 1 million dollar, 1 million dollar will be "worthless" due to massive inflation which lead to this situation

[mfw bitcoin is 10k +](
@_date: 2016-12-26 22:23:10
awsome thx, I have one final question... mind checking this post and help me find a solution? 
@_date: 2016-12-29 09:49:12
Side question . What's the best/most secure way to sell?
@_date: 2016-12-28 08:46:55
I guess you sold?
@_date: 2016-12-29 10:29:59
It's backed by math. Has anyone ever gotten a different result when adding 1+1 ? 
However political forces might have the power to break the currency. However the longer they need the harder it will be 
@_date: 2016-12-27 22:09:37
what does end-oft-the-year rallye actually mean? u think price will dropp at start of jannuray ?
@_date: 2016-12-30 02:41:18
Well i was implying that more users leads to more transactions
@_date: 2016-12-28 09:17:47
U kidding me right?
@_date: 2016-12-26 03:27:12
nono, I mean use the online wallet to send them on that key I generated with bitadress.org
like i describe here 
@_date: 2016-12-29 09:43:16
You have to tax that money right? Also how do you cash out? Sell bitcoins and they send money to your bank account?
@_date: 2016-12-25 05:58:15
Whats better?
@_date: 2016-12-27 18:04:33
Wanted to buy bitcoins 2 weeks ago because I finally decided to watch a video that explains them.
Took me quite some time to figure out how to handle everything when it comes to storage and transactions.  Now I'm a bit salty that I bought in for 150$ more than when I decided to invest but I'm still happy and excited to be part of the bitcoin network
@_date: 2016-12-29 21:04:14
Pay for what on twitter?
@_date: 2016-12-28 20:21:56
in the future we will talk about satishi millionares
@_date: 2016-12-26 03:51:39
but you can just sweep them into other wallets and then setup a new paper wallet right?
@_date: 2016-12-17 11:49:16
I checked your post history and already subbed to !  Blockchains are amazing :D thx again

i just want a cold storage for my coins on my PC 
should i just install this program first  
ideally I just want to write down the private key and keep it in my safe IRL
@_date: 2016-12-25 06:09:42
Coinbase is bad?  I just want some for a cold wallet
@_date: 2016-12-26 16:11:23
Ok thanks. So the only critical part is the creation process?
Btw i planned on doing that offline on my newly booted pc and ofc i will clear the cache afterwards
@_date: 2016-12-30 02:40:36
Oh thanks for the awnser  , 
@_date: 2017-11-06 06:57:15
Altcoins will fiill the role of everyday usage. Bitcoin is more the goldof cryptocurrencies to me
