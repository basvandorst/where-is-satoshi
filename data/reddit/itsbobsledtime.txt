Just made my first investment as well. A small amount but looking forward to more in the future.

Yeah I am pretty knowledgable about different wallets (paper, trezor, etc...). I guess my poorly worded question had to do with this [post]( 
I guess I will just move my tiny amount of Bitcoin once it comes through.

I went in at $4300 but not all in. Now I feel like I understand  the process and caveats more and feel so much better informed to go in now that it's dipping and just hodl.

Same. Just have a small weekly teansaction setup and forget about and buy less booze that week. I also don't think of it as a payment and almost like transfering from checking to savings.
