It is probably wise to invest in Bitcoin start-ups rather than buying Bitcoin, if you can.  The start-ups can always switch to another cryptocurrency if one someday outperforms Bitcoin, and they can also change and expand in different ways.
Small investors like ourselves don't have the opportunity to invest in start-ups so we invest in Bitcoin directly.  This is one of the great things about Bitcoin - *anyone* can buy in.

I didn't mean for the definition to be taken so literally.  I'm just saying the concept of "approximately equal to" already associated with the tilde would make for an easy transition into thinking of the tilde as a currency symbol.

While obviously good for Bitcoin decentralization, this is such a dumb an unimaginative idea from a business perspective it can't possibly be true.
I think (and hope) wallet hardware/software integration with everyday objects to kickstart the Internet of Things is more likely.  I'm talking about refrigerators that track and order food for you, running shoes that reward you with discounts based on your activity, etc.  That would truely bring Bitcoin to the masses, as 21's mission statement promises.  I can't imagine anything more immediately achievable that could be better for Bitcoin.

I suspect there are additional benefits to investing in Bitcoin start-ups that currently tip the scales toward this being a better investment than in Bitcoin proper.  For example, I imagine there are tax benefits to acquiring and owning bitcoin as a Company over as an individual.
Regardless, I think investments in Bitcoin start-ups are healthier overall for Bitcoin than if these investors were to just buy Bitcoin directly as they bring about new and refined use cases.

This is utopian and likely extremely flawed, but I'm interested in prediction markets / Augur for their potential to facilitate democratic governance by algorithm.  Here's my idea:
An Algorithmic Governing Entity (AGE) collects taxes from all citizens and uses the funds in two ways: 
1.  To contract out research and development of proposals for laws, budgets, infrastructure plans, changes to the algorithmic governing entity itself, etc. in a dynamic system.
2.  To fund the realization of the chosen proposals.
Augur is at the heart of this.  The AGE issues tokens on a blockchain equally to all citizens at a steady rate.  The citizens wager these tokens to predict the success of the various civic proposals.  The AGE allocates funds collected from taxation to realize the proposals based on their forecasted success rates.
The actual success/failure of the proposals is gauged in real time based on achievement check-points (written into the proposal) and citizens are paid out based on their wagers.
Tokens that have passed through the prediction market at least once may be used to supplement tax payments at a floating rate relative to the dollar (or bitcoin), otherwise they are useless.  Citizens who have earned tokens in excess of their tax requirements may sell them on the open market.
I think this could facilitate a more effective and dynamic system of governance than that of current models...or at least be an interesting experiment.
@_date: 2015-04-11 12:13:16
That's a good point.  However, the tilde represents "approximately equal to" when it is between two entities like this: A~B.  I think it could take on its own meaning as a currency symbol if it just trails a number like this: 20.99~.

I'm intrigued by this device, but I don't see it putting an end to online advertising.  Initially we may use it to access content ad-free, but eventually the ads will creep back in so that the content providers or hosting service have two sources of revenue.  There won't be enough resistance from consumers to prevent this.
For example, we pay to see a movie in the theater, but that has not stopped these facilities from continually increasing advertisement time before the show.
That said, it may work for non-profits like Wikipedia who avoid advertisement as a part of their mission statement.

In my model, wagers in the prediction market are akin to votes in that they shape the civic environment and the program of governance.  Because of this, I consider it democratic.  However, the algorithmic governing entity is dynamically defined by and given agency through the decentralized market.  There is no central governing body, just a system for organizing the wealth and ideas of a collection of individuals.
I like your idea that people just use policies (smart contracts) that are best for them.  This seems to imply an anarchistic system.  In my opinion such systems work well for networks, but they break down in physical space.  To effectively govern all aspects of a nation, I think a system needs to be able to recognize/accommodate both the individual and the collective whole; there has to be some degree of 'one-size-fits-all'.  My hope is that a system can be designed that is so dynamic, this doesn't matter.  This is what my model attempts to do.

The best possible outcome, in my opinion, is that 21 Inc is building a value-transfer layer for the 'Internet of Things'.  Such a network could facilitate transactions between smart objects, data centres, algorithms, autonomous companies, etc., which might be the 'closed loop' Srinivasan is referring to.  Considering these are all non-human entities, a purely digital money would be ideal, if not necessary.

I'm struggling to understand this like so many others.  However, I suspect the purpose of the mining chip is to allow 21Inc to build and stake a claim to a portion of the Bitcoin network through a collective of various mining enabled consumer electronics.  They will try to build the network as large and inclusive as possible, while discovering ways to monetize it along the way.  Perhaps their pool of consumer miners will afford them greater freedom to build functional layers on top of "their" portion of the Bitcoin network to the benefit of themselves and their users, thus creating the fabled Internet of Things.
From the other side, I suspect there are a great many ways programmers and consumers can take advantage of the satoshis the mining chips will mint as a new type of "system resource" -- that is, entries in a decentralized immutable ledger.  However, I don't understand how the small amount of bitcoin these chips will mint could be used in any meaningful financial way.  What surprises me is that most of 21Inc's examples seem to suggest that the expected use of this bitcoin falls more into the latter category.
If the mined bitcoin is to be used primarily for something other than money, the amount the chips are capable of mining is probably more than sufficient, especially if 21Inc can eliminate transaction fees for their pooled devices.  Mining this bitcoin rather than pre-loading it to the devices probably allows 21Inc to evade many potential regulation issues and I suspect there is some benefit to freshly minted bitcoin over transferred bitcoin in terms of "identifying" the devices/users.

Considering Bitcoin is so new and unprecedented, it is difficult to define what exactly it is.  There are divided opinions on this, even among us enthusiasts.  It seems you want us to convince you to use it as a payment network.  I'm not going to do this because your needs are being met.  Bitcoin would be a decidedly worse option for you than credit card.  Bitcoin is used as a payment network today for things such as remittance and purchases on dark markets.  Its popularity grew out of the latter, which reinforces people's expectation of it to act as a currency or payment network.  However, Bitcoin is presently inefficient in this respect, meaning it is only useful as a payment network in niche cases like those I listed above, not for the everyday user.  People are developing payment layers on top of Bitcoin that will allow Bitcoin to truly compete with credit cards and PayPal and potentially best them in many ways, but this is years off.
All this is not to say you shouldn't be interested in Bitcoin, you should just consider it differently.  Bitcoin is an uncopiable  digital entity.  It offers friction in the digital world where there was none before, potentially disrupting the balance of power in today's economies and facilitating the emergence of entirely new economies.  If you have the imagination to get excited about this, Bitcoin might just be for you after all as a hobby or an investment opportunity.

The DAO, presently "crowdfunding" is a smart contract of sorts built on Ethereum.  Check out daohub.org.
@_date: 2015-03-03 15:28:07
Really?  If I were going to hedge my bets (which I don't think is worthwhile), I would go with Ripple for its gateways, Ethereum for its turing completeness and BitShares as a solid POS.  Litecoin has nothing to offer as a competitor.  It survives only because of network effect, which will very likely concede completely to Bitcoin eventually.  I don't understand what people see in Litecoin.
@_date: 2016-05-19 00:06:19
I suspect the main reason The DAO raised so much money is because investing in it appears to be a no-risk situation.  You can retrieve the portion of your ETH that has not been committed to a proposal (100% before first proposal) anytime via a split.  Most investors believe this sets a floor for the value of The DAO.  However, I don't think they realize how difficult and time consuming it is to perform a split.  In the best case scenario, I think the majority of investors will "split" early because the prospect of actually funding any proposals appears very unfavorable; in the worst case scenario, I expect panic and chaos as investors come to understand the complexity of a split and trade below the buy-in price because there aren't enough people willing to risk buying in to perform the arbitrage.
The DAO is an interesting experiment to be sure, but I think it has a very low possibility of success and a decent probability of catastrophic failure.  Ethereum was built for this type of thing.  If they prove DAOs to be a viable entity, good for them.  Ethereum is a strong project and we can expect many great things from them.  Bitcoin is on a different path; I see no reason for it to hack its way toward copying Ethereum-based projects.

I would like to understand why we are hearing of so many companies that want the blockchain without Bitcoin.  This doesn't make any sense to me.  Is there any benefit to using blockchain technology if there is no distributed mining?  It seems to me that the bitcoin protocol would be highly inefficient as a means of keeping a ledger if the goal was not for this ledger to be secured through distributed consensus.  Why use the blockchain to create a centralized ledger?
To be clear, this isn't a rhetorical question.  I would legitimately like to know if there is any benefit to using a Bitcoin-like protocol without distributed consensus and what the applications of this might be.

I consider the "upside" of Bitcoin to be the innovation that will come out of and build upon the Bitcoin protocol -- things like autonomous agents and new things we haven't conceived of yet.  I don't think Bitcoin as a currency or a store of value alone is very exciting or likely to create a revolution.  New technologies always seem to start acting like the things they are supplanting, but don't truely take off until the real potential their underlying design affords is realized (think the early internet vs. "Web 2.0").  Governments aren't going to accept Bitcoin until something truly revolutionary is born of its design -- something new that we can't imagine living without rather than an improvement on something we already have.  If/when that happens I imagine resistance to Bitcoin will fade away.  In short, from my perspective this news does not kill the upside in the long run, only in the short.

I read your blog post last summer and what I can understand makes sense to me.  I see that competition will drive people to expend something of value to the point that the block reward is just barely profitable.  If we are talking just in terms of money, PoW and PoS are basically equal.  However, are there not some things that are better to waste than others?  For example, in the grand scheme of things, would it not be better for humanity if stakers waste investment opportunity than if miners waste non-renewable energy?...or do you believe everything comes back to energy anyway, as in the stakers are not investing in research and development of renewable energy so the ultimate effect is the same?

Thanks for the clarification.  So, good practice in this scenario would be to only open a channel once with an address.  If you ever want to close and reopen a channel for whatever reason, you would close the first then open a new channel with a separate address, correct?
@_date: 2016-04-13 22:34:24
No, I think that is a misinterpretation of the developers' plan. They are rational people who want what's best for the network.  The block size will be kept to a minimum sure, but it will scale appropriately as needed.  The LN will work in tandem with regular blockchain transactions.  Your wallet will decide which route is the most appropriate for each transaction.  For example, if someone tries to send you a sum of bitcoin greater than the amount you have in your lightning (checking) account, your wallet will route the transaction over the blockchain instead of the LN.  As such, Bitcoin will scale outside of the LN to both support the LN and keep the fee market reasonable.
@_date: 2016-04-14 01:52:29
No, I'm not certain; I'm open to being proved wrong.  My feelings are probably better expressed in the second paragraph of my original post above.
@_date: 2016-04-14 01:02:40
I don't consider LN transactions to be "off-chain", at least not in the same sense that ChangeTip transactions or crypto coin trading for example are off-chain.  With those examples, money movement is recorded in centralized databases and if these databases are compromised, there is no reliable recourse for the user.  While it is true we can expect large hubs to form on the LN and these may even be associated with payment processors, like Coinbase, due to their large bitcoin holdings, these are nothing like the centralized database examples I listed above.  You are still transacting in bitcoin in this scenario and your funds are still guaranteed on the blockchain through the multisignature arrangement that facilitates the LN.  From my understanding, there is no more possibility of censoring these transactions as there is censoring transactions on the blockchain.  If anything it is probably more secure than the scenario we have now.  Presently, governments could shut down Coinbase, for example, and confiscate their bitcoin wallets and users would loose their bitcoin.  With the LN, the bitcoin that supports payment channels cannot be confiscated.  It would simply be returned to users after a set period of time if the LN hub was compromised.
We need a solution like the LN to make it feasible for Bitcoin to work as a payment network.  It is fully integrated with Bitcoin proper -- eventually, it will just be considered a part of Bitcoin.  We are more likely to experience what you fear happening to Bitcoin without the LN.  Bitcoin cannot scale to become a worldwide payment network without additional layers built on top, so bitcoin payments would likely come to be processed off-chain more and more by processors like Coinbase and Bitpay.
@_date: 2016-04-13 19:59:40
I feel the same way.  I had my "ah-ha" moment a few hours ago...typed out here:
The LN sounds impractical until you realize that it is essentially just a checking account.  I expect when the network and interfaces mature, your bitcoin wallet will simply have two accounts, like your bank, one for checking and one for savings.  The savings account is like your bitcoin wallet now.  Your checking account will manage bitcoin addresses and open and close LN channels in the background.  You won't even know you are using it.  The same will apply for businesses.  Once LN is worked out and established, I think it will actually be easier to transact in bitcoin than it is now, hopefully improving adoption rates.
I never believed Bitcoin would work as a payment network.  I always thought of it as a digital asset and hoped it would excel as a competitor to gold.  It is crazy to imagine the blockchain recording every single Bitcoin transaction worldwide.  That is massively inefficient.  Why does the purchase of a cup of coffee require billions of dollars worth of security to verify?  It doesn't, and Bitcoin could never scale that way.  The LN is a necessary layer to make Bitcoin viable as a payment network, something I didn't think possible until I understood it.
@_date: 2016-04-13 17:26:10
That sounds like a good analogy.  I imagine when the LN matures, it will be like having a checking account separate from your savings account at the bank, except you are the bank.  The various software applications that people use will manage Bitcoin addresses and open and close LN channels behind the scenes to optimize the payment network using the bitcoin in your *Checking Account*.  Presumably there will be some minor monetary incentive.  The bitcoin in your *Savings Account* will just reside there, as if in a vault.  
I find it interesting that with the legacy system, the money in your *Savings Account* earns you interest as a reward for allowing the bank to use it to issue loans, etc.  With the LN, the opposite is true; you earn fees (akin to interest) with the money in your *Checking Account* because it gives liquidity to the the larger network.

I think the important point to take from this is that Visa Europe believes they can extend their utility by connecting with the Bitcoin blockchain.  This isn't just about remittance.  They could have integrated directly with M-Pesa, but chose instead to make this connection via Bitcoin because they see that Bitcoin itself will be so well connected.  Bitcoin will become the financial device with the most utility because it allows permissionless innovation.  Look at all the innovative applications already being built with Bitcoin.  Any financial institution that integrates Bitcoin will instantly extend their utility through this network, where it would otherwise be extremely costly, time consuming and likely not even possible to integrate with these applications directly.  Once someone like Visa does it, all other finanancial institutions / instruments will have to follow or be at a significant disadvantage.  This is why financial institutions would be wise to spend their research and development efforts on Bitcoin rather than private blockchains.

@_date: 2015-12-22 00:22:22
The "massive network" I'm imagining is the interconnected blockchains of individual companies, banks and countries.  In effect, the technology is superior because it doesn't suffer the "burden" of proof of work consensus, which is only important to us who believe in a distributed permissionless network.  The Bitcoin market cap is only 6.5 billion and there aren't *that* many killer apps presently.  If the competitors make it easy for companies to deploy their own blockchains customized for their individual uses and a means of interconnecting them, they could easily overtake Bitcoin's network effect.
@_date: 2015-12-22 01:23:24
I get what you are saying and I considered the possibility that my comment would come across as ignorant.  Perhaps "trivial" is too strong a word.  However, the breakthrough with Bitcoin was achieving consensus in a decentralized trustless system.  The challenge is scaling this and possibly adding functionality without compromising or degrading this feature.  Surely the challenge of achieving greater scale and functionality in a network of centralized, trust-based blockchains is much simpler.   Judging by the task-force, the competitor appears very capable and determined.
@_date: 2015-12-21 19:42:25
This is real competition for Bitcoin and frankly I think they have us beat in all but one area.  It looks like every company, bank, government, etc. will soon have its own permissioned blockchain and that these will be pegged together in a massive network.  If every company can create their own blockchain, this is effectively "permissionless innovation".  Additionally, these permissioned blockchains will be be vastly more efficient than Bitcoin and each can handle added functionality, like smart contracts appropriate for its specific use.
The one area Bitcoin remains uncontested is as a fair, open, "for the people" asset.  Considering the formidable competition in all other areas, I really think we should focus on branding (and maybe even developing) Bitcoin as the most democratic store of value.  Incidentally, this is also the use case that would be most effective in raising the monetary value of bitcoin.  Also, if we are successful in branding Bitcoin as a digital gold and securing large amounts of value, Bitcoin will stand stronger against its competition and there will be more incentive for developers to extend and build upon the functionality of the Bitcoin blockchain.

It is unfortunate so many feel the need to offer a rude response.  To answer your question, all mining contracts are basically scams, which should be avoided.  Imagine if you had a machine that made $1/day.  For how much would you be willing to rent that machine out?  The answer of course is only for an amount greater than $1/day.  Thus the renter can never profit.  You should also know that you are unlikely to profit it you purchase mining hardware and mine yourself based on the same principal.  If you want to own bitcoin, it is best to buy it directly.

You will be downvoted, but I have to agree.  I'm extremely bullish with regards to Bitcoin in general.  It is useful for a handful of things presently and has near limitless potential for future uses.  However, I don't share others' enthusiasm for its use in e-commerce...at least not yet.
@_date: 2015-12-21 23:33:08
I'm not so sure.  I think this is a serious threat.  The plan seems to be to allow businesses, banks, governments, etc. to each deploy their own permissioned blockchain and link them all together in a massive network.  Obviously this doesn't uphold the ideals of Bitcoin, but who will care except us enthusiasts?  These blockchains will have all the transaction features of Bitcoin and more, while being much faster and more capable of scaling than Bitcoin.
However, Bitcoin maintains one distinct advantage - the bitcoin asset token.  I don't think these competitors will ever release an asset they can't control with limited supply, like bitcoin.  We'll see BitFiat, but not a true competitor asset.  Given the formidable competition, I think we should focus our efforts to "brand" Bitcoin as *the democratic asset*.  People should think of Bitcoin as a store of value for the people, by the people.  Incidentally, this is the avenue that will most positively influence the market cap of Bitcoin and the more valuable it is, the more likely people are to take it seriously and the more developers will be interested in extending its features and building on top of it. 
If we can effectively position Bitcoin as I have stated above, I think this competitor network of blockchains will actually help legitimize Bitcoin and bring awareness to it.  If we can't refine and convey what Bitcoin is with clarity, I fear that the general public will just come to regard it as a less capable, outdated technology.

Excellent article; I agree completely.  Do you think Bitcoin proper is even capable of scaling to compete?  If not, could a solution like the Lightning Network save us?  I'm not a programmer, but it seems to me that the interbanking blockchain network you describe will always be more efficient because it doesn't have the "burden" of proof of work distributed consensus - it is so much more streamlined.  I'm torn as to whether or not Bitcoin should even try to compete as a payment/settlement network at this point, or if it should instead focus on addressing the mining centralization issue and take on gold with a marketing initiative in an attempt to become the preferred store of value.  I'm inclined to think the latter.  If we can bring massive wealth into Bitcoin, it will legitimize the project in the eyes of the public and buy us time to sort out the scaling issues properly.

I'm personally interested in Bitcoin for the things it facilitates that would otherwise be impossible such as DACs, effective microtransactions, direct person to content creator payment via QR code imbedded in an image or video, etc.
I think this community puts too much focus on retail stores accepting Bitcoin.  Bitcoin will create new markets and entire financial ecosystems.  I'm not as optimistic about it displacing credit cards in regular retail transactions.
I share the same concerns about security, but I expect this to be solved as Bitcoin matures.

I think changetip is different from your other examples because it acts like a bank in that it holds users' bitcoin.  It and services like it will probably be regulated.

I don't know if I fully understand the regulations, but it seems that they make initiatives like changetip impractical to the point of being useless and they make DACs (Distributed Autonomous Companies) entirely impossible from a legal standpoint.

I largely agree with you.  However, you have to respect that there is a down-side to piracy.  For example, my favorite record label,  is run by Michael Gira, the lead of Swans.  Gira "discovered" and released the first albums of a few great and now popular artists, like Devendra Banhart.  He has said that it is no longer feasible for him to release other artists' music on his label due to declining sales, despite the fact that the musicians on his label are becoming more and more popular.  He now only releases his own music, which is a shame because he brought many interesting artists into popularity.
Regardless, I never intended to start a debate about the merits of piracy.  The beauty of the concept outlined in my original post is that it exists alongside piracy as an alternate option, not in opposition to it.  It can only be beneficial to artists and consumers alike.

Here's $1 worth of Bitcoin to experiment with.  Vault of Satoshi is our best overall exchange, but you will have to fill out a lot of paperwork and wait to get approved.
If you want to buy a Bitcoin or two quickly, you could do this through Local Bitcoins.  You have to be more careful with this option, though.  Think of it a as a Kijiji for Bitcoin and beware of scammers.
QuickBT is a good way to buy small amounts of Bitcoin (currently 0.2 BTC / Day) quickly with a debit card and no paperwork.  However, you pay high fees for this convenience.
Most importantly, make sure you look into how to keep your Bitcoins secure.  I recommend a paper wallet if you intend to hold onto them as an investment.  I think CoinKite is a good place to hold small amounts in the short term while you figure this out.

I agree, preventing piracy is impossible, and I wouldn't want that even if it were possible.  I am suggesting the latter as a friendly alternative to piracy and traditional digital sales networks.  I think it would be a win-win for consumers and artists alike.  Consumers could choose to buy regular copyable goods, pirate them, or buy special expanded "limited edition" versions of the product (which could even be signed/personalized by the artist in the blockchain).  The artists would benefit from the additional revenue from this new third pillar in digital goods sales.
I think a happy side effect of what I am proposing would be the return of the spirit of collecting and trading that seems to have diminished since everything started going digital.

In my opinion there is little reason for the average Joe to use Bitcoin now.  Bitcoin is currently most useful for remittance and for purchasing things on dark markets.  However, Bitcoin possesses such incredible potential that many people buy and hold it as a bet on the realization of this potential and the rise in value it would bring.
Everyone has their own interpretation of this "potential"; here's mine:
In essence, Bitcoin is a computer science breakthrough that enables distributed consensus - that is, it allows networked computers to definitively agree or disagree on the validity of information without human intervention.  This has never been possible until now. 
Previous to Bitcoin, if you wanted to keep a ledger of financial assets, votes in an election, etc. you needed a centralized authority - a trustee to preside over this information and the networks that connect into it.  This model encourages hierarchical structures of power, it invites corruption and it is slow to act and evolve.
Bitcoin replaces the trustee with a protocol hosted on a network of computers that redistributes power horizontally and is incorruptible.  This protocol/network can extend to disrupt and preside over all components of society that currently involve an intermediary.

This is the first news I consider to be truly bad for the Bitcoin protocol.  I had hoped Bitcoin would be treated like a currency, not a property.  I know very little about finances, but it seems this will make it much more complicated to transact in Bitcoin legally, which will slow adoption, if not halt it entirely.
I have been enthusiastic about Bitcoin for its potential to bring us effective microtransactions, to facilitate Distributed Autonomous Corporations, and to open up other new types of financial transaction never before possible once Bitcoin adoption reaches maturity.  How can we ever expect it to get there now that every minor transaction has to be recorded and filed?
We should make it our priority to convince the IRS to reconsider their position.  Bitcoin should be classified as a currency.

I agree.  I'm a huge believer in Bitcoin, but not for its potential to displace cash, debit and credit card payment methods online, and especially offline.  Current systems work well enough.
I believe in Bitcoin primarily for its potential to create new markets and entire financial ecosystems by facilitating things that would otherwise be impossible, such as Distributed Autonomous Corporations (DACs), effective microtransactions, direct person to content creator payment via QR code imbedded in an image or video, etc.
Bitcoin's acceptance in retail is a useful stepping stone, but Bitcoin won't really take off until it succeeds in facilitating an entirely new way to transact that people can't live without.  Once it does, the general public will have real reason to use it, giving it the support it will need to displace well established competition in other markets.

I don't understand why people compare gold and Bitcoin - they are completely different.  Gold is a commodity that is used as a store of value, in jewellery and in electronics.  Bitcoin is a protocol which can facilitate things like direct person to person (or content creator) payment, distributed autonomous corporations, effective micortransactions and other possibilities we haven't even discovered yet.
Gold's price is determined by what people are willing to pay for it.  Bitcoin's price is determined by its utility (or potential utility) at a given time.

This is an important idea.  Taking the concept a bit further than proof of ownership, digital goods (music, video games, movies, ebooks, etc.) can now be officially issued in limited quantities if tied to a coloured coin somehow.  The idea would take some fleshing out, but it could potentially enable a distinction between official digital goods and unofficial copies, which might help to curb piracy as some people (especially collectors) favor the official version.  Recording artists could even *sign* digital copies of their songs/albums with a personal message to the buyer.
I love that this could also lead to a second hand market for official digital goods, as you pointed out.  There is something special about the act of collecting music and other art with limited print runs that has been completely lost as everything went digital.
The more I think about it, the more significant this seems.  I hope someone develops an application for artists to start releasing limited edition, signed digital music, films, etc.  It is an elegant solution to piracy because it creates a market for official digital goods without entering a futile war against unofficial copies and those who prefer to pirate them.
@_date: 2015-05-30 03:49:22
I'm not sure what you mean by "while your money takes money away from people who're holding it".  However, I can say that Bitcoin would be the main currency.

This is great, but I was hoping for more innovative ideas.  Others outside of academia are already working on projects very similar to all of these.
I'd love to see a service that allows artists to give scarcity to their digital work and facilitate its distribution in "limited editions".  I think the potential of digital scarcity in art is huge.  It could bring the pride of ownership and joy of collecting back to the music industry, for example, which might cut down on piracy and increase revenue for the artists (and distributors in larger operations).

I like the idea of ads, but it has to be done right.  Informational ads are boring.  The most successful advertising sells a lifestyle or an ideal.  If it's hip and intriguing, people will look up the information for themselves, which is what we want.
A few ideas come to mind:
1.  Something "counter-culture" that expresses how cool it is that Bitcoin enables us, the 99% to shift the power balance away from the government back toward the populace by way of taking control of our own money/wealth.  This should be expressed with hip, well-adjusted looking people - no Guy Fawkes / anonomous bullshit.
2.  Something futuristic powered by Bitcoin - maybe the workings of a distributed autonomous taxi company.  Self-driving taxis shuttle people of all types in a vast city network; a shot of a person paying the fair in Bitcoin; a shot of a person checking the dividends they receive as a shareholder in this DAC; the taxi driving itself into a futuristic garage for an algorithm upgrade...
2.  Something that expresses what Bitcoin means for the unbanked populations and for people who rely on remittance from relatives working in wealthier countries.
Don't bother with things like listing the businesses where you can spend Bitcoin.  Nobody cares.  It is the big, amazing things that Bitcoin and blockchain can facilitate, like those I listed above that will win people over.

I'm not really sure, I only have a seed of the idea.  I think the principal of coloured coins as well as perks with proof of ownership as you suggested are good starting points.  Further down the road we could see streamlined platforms such as a cross between iTunes and discogs.com or even entire new industries.  Scarce digital media has never existed before.  Who knows where enterprising individuals could take it.  
I would expect something that leverages the qualities inherent to digital media such as its incredible portability, broadcastability and editability against the traditional, almost nostalgic qualities that arise from scarcity, such as community built around trade, the art and pride of building a unique collection and the appreciation one affords to something they have worked hard to attain.

The bets are limited to whether a selected statement is true or false.  It seems to me that provides little room for invalid bet creation.  Of course, many statements cannot be proven to be either, so there would have to be some way to detect and cancel these.
The support of truth is the incentive to participate.  The prediction market rewards those who are correct and punishes those who are not, theoretically shifting power towards smarter participants over time.  The overall pot for each bet would naturally be relative in size to the exposure of the statement.  This works out nicely to incentivize greater participation in fact checking higher profile statements, which will influence the most people.  Also, the more the support for a statement deviates from what you believe to be true, the greater your incentive to bet in the other direction to correct the statement and make money with greater odds.  If everyone believes a statement to be true or false and most bets support the same, there is little incentive to participate, which is fine because the objective of fact checking/verification has already been achieved.
This idea assumes that prediction markets are effective.  I cannot debate whether or not this is true because I don't have any experience working with them.  I just find the concept behind them interesting and I've been thinking about how they may be used or built upon if ever successfully realized.

However, the few satoshis that they do produce could perhaps be transacted as coloured coins...somehow (I don't know what would define their value).

Proposals would follow a formula that allows their success to be gauged against a real world check point.  For your example, the proposal might be something like this:
Only creationism should be taught in science class.  This will result in a a greater than 10% increase in general science comprehension amongst students after a period of one year.
Given that this proposal has a real world check it has to pass, the incentive is to vote based on expected truth/results, not opinion.

I wouldn't replace it with anything.  I'm just saying people will hold Bitcoin as a store of value more so than they will transact with it.  Bitcoins will still function as a token to incentivize mining and the securing of the blockchain.
@_date: 2017-02-11 23:46:09
This is all just theoretical; I'm not taking it quite so seriously.  I don't have the background to build such a thing.  That said, I don't think the problem of discouraging invalid bet creation needs to be so complicated.  Off the top of my head, it could possibly be addressed by requiring a "deposit" for every bet.  The deposit would be returned only if the bet is successfully closed, regardless of whether the individual who participated in the bet was on the winning or loosing side.  That way, people who cannot grasp the concept of creating decidable bets would quickly be discouraged from participating.  There is no need for the system to be all inclusive.

Well, I guess "support" might have been the wrong word.  What I mean to say is that my interests in Bitcoin have never included tax evasion.  In fact, I can't imagine Bitcoin achieving the level of adoption and legitimization I want for it without some form of taxation.  Ideally, in time Bitcoin will see appropriate regulation and taxation to allow it to thrive in the ways we all know it can.

I don't know.  There are numerous individuals/teams developing distributed prediction markets and this seems to be the crux of the challenge.  My idea assumes that prediction markets will be successfully realized and it will be possible to build upon them.

I feel like $50,000 / BTC is a reasonable valuation to expect if Bitcoin succeeds in going mainstream.  I have wagered an amount of money buying Bitcoin that would allow me to pay off my mortgage should that number ever be reached.  No mortgage would allow my family to travel a few times a year on my wife's and my salary.  This is all I really want that our financial situation currently denies us.
The World Bitcoin Network published a web app for estimating Bitcoin valuation with sliders based on a number of factors.  I'm on my phone so I can't look it up.  I suggest you search for it as I think it would help you answer your own question.
@_date: 2015-01-26 11:15:46
This is terrible advice.  We've heard stories of families ruined by people buying with this mentality.  Crippling debt is a far worse prospect than excess wealth.  It is too easy to get caught up in the excitement of Bitcoin's potential and loose sight of the risks.  Everyone should always be advised to never invest more than they can afford to loose.

These are all fair criticisms that I agree with.  Likely, the the proposals would have to be built up from many smaller proposals in dialogue with one another to achieve the levels of complexity we are talking about here.
I'm not suggesting this is a perfect system, only that I believe it has the potential to be a better design than current democratic models.  My write-up is just the seed of an idea that would take decades of research and development to flesh out into the beginnings of a working model.
@_date: 2015-05-12 02:20:25
What is important in this relationship is that bitcoins have value so that they incentivize mining.  Bitcoin need not be successful as a currency to have value.  It could achieve great value as a commodity in which people store their wealth, as I describe in my original post.  I think a sidechain with faster confirmations and greater potential transactions per second will relieve Bitcoin proper of the burden of acting as a currency.
@_date: 2015-01-28 23:33:37
Of course it's a joke.
@_date: 2014-03-25 22:41:20
Yes, I agree.  I support taxation.  It [EDIT] *was* inevitable.  I just don't want the form of taxation to increase friction in Bitcoin transactions.
@_date: 2015-05-12 01:12:44
I suppose it is a currency, but I think it will be thought of more as a commodity with the qualities I describe in my original post.  I suspect value transfers via Bitcoin proper will primarily be between large entities like corporations and governments rather than individuals and a sidechain with properties more suitable for a currency will be used for the smaller, more frequent value transfers of e-commerce, etc.

The spam is annoying for everyone.  I imagine most Ethereum enthusiasts want it to stop even more than Bitcoiners due to the air of immaturity it (wrongfully) casts on the Ethereum community.
I don't think the spam has anything to do with the recent rise in price in Ethereum, but I suspect the spammers do, and this is why it continues.  Ethereum is a worthwhile project that I believe was undervalued in comparison to Litecoin and Ripple.  I've been meaning to buy in since it was released, but I've been waiting for the bottom.  I think the rise in value is due to others like me who have been waiting, and now worry that this might be the last chance to buy Ether at relatively low prices.

Taxes aren't so bad if the funds are used effectively and efficiently to the benefit of the collective, as this model would hopefully facilitate.
@_date: 2015-05-12 04:44:35


This is where I disagree.  I think the currency aspect of Bitcoin was essential in its beginnings (and still important now), but this will become less and less a factor in its valuation over time.  Now that people are starting to see the significance of the blockchain and build things on top of it (NASDAQ being the latest example) it is entirely possible people will store value in Bitcoin because they see it becoming an integral part of major commercial, financial and political infrastructure.  The more gets built on top of Bitcoin, the more legitimate/significant it becomes and the more sound it will be as an investment strategy.

So there *will* be a decision...I was betting on no decision.  I'm much less confidant about an outright approval.

Yes, but surely governments don't want to be subordinate to the banking industry.  If there comes a moment when legislation or lack-there-of could tip the power one way or another between Banks versus Bitcoin, I think it is possible some governments may take the opportunity to switch sides to regain power over the bankers.

The more connections in a network the better.  I wanted the ETF to be approved.  However, at least we can be sure Bitcoin is still absolutely anti-establishment.

I'm curious why you think Ethereum is better.  I invested in the crowd sale and did very well, but converted most of it back to Bitcoin.  I don't have a background in computer science, but to me a "dumb" base protocol with smart contracts built on top just makes sense.  All of technology is built in layers.  Why take on the full burden of smart contracts at the base protocol of a new paradigm?
@_date: 2017-03-03 14:14:53
I have read so many of these posts and associated comments that I am actually happy I got in at the $200 - 800 range.  I imagine very few who bought in at the sub $10 range securely stored, remembered about and held onto their coins.  Did many people even really think of Bitcoin as a long term investment back then?
@_date: 2016-06-26 20:32:47
I generally support the core developers' strategy and I think the lightning network, or something like it, is the only way Bitcoin (or any cryptocurrency) can support the Machine Payable Web / Internet of Things.  That said, if 21 determines it necessary to switch to Ethereum, this would by my tipping point; I'd switch too.  21 are doing the most interesting and impactful work in this space by far, in my opinion.
@_date: 2016-06-16 17:36:17
A global network of crypto-fiats would legitimize/popularize the types of apps and consumer practices that are currently the biggest barrier to Bitcoin adoption.  I don't think anyone will attempt to "outlaw" Bitcoin.  It will persist as a digital asset and worldwide currency alongside crypto-fiat.
Bitcoin also has advantages that crypto-fiat will never match, such as the limited supply and the ability to use it without an account with the issuer, making it ideal for the Internet of Things / Machine Payable Web.  Thus, I expect it will only become more popular and valuable.

I have either broke even or lost value (bitcoin/USD) in my few attempts at trading.  However, three things have worked in my favour:
1. Holding
2. Investing in a few promising ICOs (after exhaustive research)
3. Registering and selling Namecoin domains a few years ago (don't bother with this now)
 
@_date: 2017-01-25 21:30:52
You definitely want to move all the coins in your paper wallet at once.  Not doing so is what could result in you loosing bitcoin to a change address you don't control.
Buy a trivial amount of bitcoin and use it to make a new paper wallet.    Experiment with that first to calm your nerves.

I wonder if Satoshi might commit some of his coins to build a hub.  It would be an interesting display of support for the direction in which Bitcoin is developing (if he agrees with it), but I can't imagine with whom he would open up such a historic channel.

This is probably a stupid question, but considering one of the biggest drawbacks of large block sizes is the anticipated loss of nodes (resulting in increased centralization) due to the average user not having internet speeds that can handle the size, is there not some way to split up the task of running a node between multiple people?  Could nodes be split into sub-nodes, which each contain only a portion of the blockchain, but together represent a full node?

I'm thinking about buying REP in the Augur presale.  It appears to be a tradable licence to report for Augur.  Trading fees are distributed proportionally to REP holders provided they are honest.
I understand prediction markets are illegal.  I expect the Augur team will have legal trouble, but the protocol will be unstoppable for the same reasons BitTorrent is unstoppable.  However, what can reporters holding REP expect?  Does participation come at the risk of legal trouble?

These two quotes in particular indicate that Krugman does not understand the technical aspects of Bitcoin and has no imagination.  No doubt the value of bitcoin seems absurd to those who understand it as nothing more than a digitized dollar.  What is unbelievable to me is how many people fall into this category and still feel the need to comment on what they don't understand.

I disagree.  Some people respect his opinion.  The more posts point out that he is "clueless about Bitcoin", the higher this sentiment will reach on Google...perhaps high enough for him to actually attempt to inform himself.  Then we have another potential supporter.
@_date: 2017-04-06 03:13:50
I agree with the sentiment in the tweet.  Speaking only as an observer, not a programmer or engineer, it seems the best way forward is to rework SegWit so that it doesn't render AsicBoost ineffective (but perhaps fixes any damaging effects AsicBoost may have) so that we can neutralize the supposed obstruction to Segwit adoption.  Is this possible?
Following that, I would like to see AsicBoost released into the public domain to level the playing field and minimize the centralizing effects that exist when the exploit is privately controlled/managed.  Perhaps we could crowd fund the purchase of the patent from its inventor.

I'm a layperson.  Can you explain what happened to transactions that were recorded in the unintentional hard fork, which failed?  Did the bitcoin default back to the sender as if it was never sent?
@_date: 2015-08-27 03:37:50
I feel like there must be some way the work of hosting the blockchain could be distributed so that the sub-nodes cannot make alterations to their portion - something like a puzzle, which wouldn't fit back together if a piece was altered.  Each full node could be compared with all the others and any node that deviates from the established norm is ignored.

Direct them to sign up with a free wallet account at coinkite, then buy bitcoin via QuickBT.  QuickBT sells small amounts of bitcoin (currently up to 0.2 BTC) and only requires a debit card - no verification.
This is the simplest and fastest way to buy Bitcoin in Canada as far as I now.

I don't understand how anyone could ever take cloud mining seriously as an investment.  If someone has a machine that makes $x per day, how much do you think they will rent that machine out to you for, &lt;$x or &gt;$x per day?  Is it not obvious?
In this case, I suppose there is an agenda that muddies the equation, but still!

The most interesting/frightening aspect of this is that the car (or whatever) only needs enough profit to pay for its overhead, research and development.  It does not need/want anything beyond that.  Every human-run corporation pays out to its owners and their employees so that these people may enjoy the necessaries and luxuries of life.  Consequently, there is no way a human-run company can compete in price/value with an autonomous company that offers the same services.  This development will ramp up quickly and I suspect it will be both exciting and devastating.
Also, now that machines can mint their own money and pay people, this development will be very difficult to stop because no mater how desperate things may get for humanity (or perhaps directly because of this desperation), there will always be someone willing to fill in the gaps of what the machines can't do for bitcoin.  I mean, right now Bitcoin the protocol hires miners to verify transactions.  If Bitcoin became the primary currency of an oppressive machine species, it isn't as though we could just all agree to shut it down.  People are greedy and some will always continue to mine so long as the machines keep paying.
@_date: 2016-09-11 04:56:30
Ethereum is the only other "cryptocurrency" I take seriously.  It can do much more powerful smart contracts than Bitcoin at the protocol level and it will eventually switch to proof of stake.  There is much debate as to whether either of these things are beneficial, but they are certainly interesting.  Ethereum has the most robust team of developers outside Bitcoin and they aren't afraid to innovate recklessly, which I think is appropriate for a second place competitor (though certainly not for Bitcoin).  1/6 of my cryptocurrency investment is in Ether because I believe there is a slight chance their strategy will prevail over Bitcoin.  Bitcoin, of course, makes up the other 5/6 of my portfolio.
To preempt any comments about the DAO and splitting into ETH and ETC, this was absolutely a total fuck up, but I think it will eventually be forgotten.
