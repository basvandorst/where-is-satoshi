I apologise for this post in advance, but at this point I am honestly so very sick of seeing the "you haven't lost until you've sold" nonsense and its equivalents being posted, and this really needs pointing out:
That saying should only be used in the context of the realisation of taxable losses.
The meaning of that expression to explain that the only time a financial loss in an investment can be factored into taxes is upon their sale. You may have lost 99% of the value of an investment 8 years ago, but if you only sold that property today, you only "realised" the loss today. The timing of the realisation of losses, and the meaning of that expression, is important when you consider that capital losses can be used to offset capital gains only for a set period of time after their sale (such as the same financial year):
So whenever you hear the expression "you haven't lost until you've sold", or if someone suggests anything like it to convince you to hold on to any investment, replace that saying with this in your mind:
***"For tax purposes, the loss you've already made won't be important until you sell"***
To suggest to people who have held BTC from $1200 to $350 that they "haven't lost" is simply nonsense. If your portfolio is worth less today than when you opened your position, you've lost money.
One of the most important tenets of investing is this:
***"cut your losses short, and let your profits run"***
Why is this so important, you might ask? Because *losses will hurt you more than profits will help you*. At $350, BTC has now fallen 71% since the $1200 high. If anyone has been holding that entire time, they've lost the majority of the monetary value of that holding. But the interesting thing about that drop is that if anyone in such a position is wanting to hold on until they make that 71% back, they need the price to rise not by 71%, but by **342%**.
Day traders, for example, are usually wrong more often than they're right. But if they follow the rule of cutting losses short and letting profits run, they can be wrong nine times out of ten and STILL make a profit, because they've limited the amount of money they can lose by cutting their losses short.

Haha, well, thank you. 
The question is now whether I need to update that disclosure statement...

This isn't a problem for most developed countries.

Don't worry. It's a call centre which exists for legality purposes. You don't think the rant would be recorded?

I have to ask... **why does it matter one way or the other?** 
First and foremost: In my opinion, yes, the necessity of accepting transactions with 0 confirmations for the sake of immediacy does leave sellers vulnerable to double-spend exploits. That vulnerability is inherent to the nature of how transactions function, and you're lying to yourself if you say otherwise. 
***However***, that being the case, I still honestly don't think it matters - particularly in the context of brick and mortar businesses, as is being suggested. I haven't seen any reasonable arguments making the case to the contrary.
If that paragraph seems somewhat contradictory to the one before it, I would say to consider cheques. Large numbers of businesses still accept cheques, even though it takes days to confirm whether a cheque is valid or not. People can and do exploit that vulnerability to varying degrees - but, importantly, the rate at which such exploitation occurs is actually rather minimal. This is because there are social and legal ramifications to exploiting businesses in this manner which make it a hindrance to do so in all but a minority of instances.
While it could be argued that web services would be more likely to experience the illegal antisocial behaviours being described, there's no reason why many online businesses couldn't wait for a couple of confirmations anyway. 
Just as a bit of a disclaimer, before anyone mistakes me for a part of the r/Bitcoin "FUD" echo chamber: I don't own any BTC, and don't intend on owning any in the near or medium term. I'm more than happy to sit on the sidelines while the protocol and surrounding infrastructure prove themselves (or otherwise).
