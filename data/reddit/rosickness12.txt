If you're in U.S. I'd stay away from Coinbase.  Have had some very bad experiences with them. Should have learned after the first time.  And second.  Also, they are known to work closely with the IRS and give information outside of their terms and conditions.  I've liked Gemini. But really, it's a matter of time before they get hacked internally or externally so the soft or hard wallet is a much better move.  I used to keep it on the exchange but after investing a year's rent I figured to look in to it.  Exchanges have been hacked in the past and that money is long gone.  No insurance at all.  Technically they can close their doors and leave with everyone's money and the governments and banks would love that.

I'd think people who don't know anything about it will start to look in to it.  No one wants to put all their money in blue chip stocks and savings account.  Bitcoin will look more attractive during a recession resulting in more demand for it.  Then after the recession many will still invest knowing its potential.  So in short, it'll result in curiosity growth.

I'll most likely always have something in Bitcoin. Along with other investments such as Banks. There's enough money for both to profit.
@_date: 2019-11-27 20:11:55
I know I'm able to buy anything I want with my BTC immediately.  If I need to buy a large purchase with money in the bank:
I have to go to the bank between 9-5 which I can't do if work is busy.
Before noon on a Saturday.
No Sunday.
No Holidays (even the ones where most people work.)
Cash at ATM is limited.  I can call and talk to a manager to raise it a couple hundred for one day.  You know, for my security.  AKA the customer isn't responsible enough to not fuck up.
Get questioned and sign a long piece of paper if it's wired because I might be a tax dodging drug dealing terrorist.  Or wait for their outdated ass ACH system.
If I withdraw too much of my money in some "judgement call" matter it gets reported to the government on a federal level and then I have to have proof it was for legit items which is a fucking headache.  If banks don't report these judgement calls they get fined by that lovely government.

Yes those examples are rare.  It's still a limitation of the current banking system.  But something that is a common pain is how some banks are denying people from using a legal currency which is bitcoin.  We should never ever be inconvenienced by an industry that has shown their shady side too often.  While we are making legal purchases. I have a credit union and they have been good with the amount of bitcoin I've moved in and out.

If an "exchange" says their giving away coin and all you have to do is send .25 coin for 1 btc, don't fall for it.  Stay away from Coinbase.

Depends on amount and laws. Banks in US are sued by government if they don't report certain transactions. Thing is if you're depositing a couple Grand a day the back doesn't have a set pattern to report. It's common sense and up to managers discretionary to report it. Anything over $10k in one transaction needs to be reported. But ignoring continuous large amounts could get a bank sued.  If you're a business you file to get past this.

It is.  Even an exchange would be better.  If you're adamant on not getting a hardware wallet I'd put it in the Gemini exchange.  Highly recommend taking a second look at a hardware wallet.  You don't lose the coins if you lose the wallet.  You just have to keep the secure words to establish another wallet.  And if you make enough sheets with words you can't lose it.  Keep one at your parents, one hidden at your place, one in a bank safe deposit box.  Whatever.  But fuckin' Robin hood?

Exactly.  It's not an all or nothing thing.  Too often people treat this like you have to have a lot or just have nothing.

If I had the money I'd manipulate this shit too.  This may not be a popular comment but there needs to be some kind of regulation to prevent market manipulation.  By doing this most people won't get conned and retailers would be more likely to accept it.

Given the volume activity right now, it tends to confirm within 30 minutes.  Can take up to two hours.  Gemini has been the best for me.  Except they do maintenance around 10pm on Thursdays and can last hours.  Sucks if the coin is dropping at that time and you want to sell some.

Given the popularity of Bitcoin is much higher than it was at the whopping 3 halving, there is a high chance the price could crash at this halving.

DO NOT TAKE A PICTURE.  If your phone craps out and someone gets the recycled part, they get your pictures.  Twice I found Verizon give my phone parts to a crappy middle eastern phone store and mexico.  I started seeing pictures on my Dropbox come through.  In fact, with broken phones don't trade them in.  Just break the shit.  What I did is write the 24 words down in a cryptic matter.  1 is number 4.  2 is 5.  3 is 6.  Something like that.

How do you run a 100% offline wallet?  I have Ledger S and thought what if someone installed a key logger on my phone.  All they'd need is the login.  Is there a device that can't move crypto unless the actual HW wallet was connected?

If a bank said no to $5k I'd close that account asap.  Legally they have to report anything over $10k.  If a customer is withdrawing over $3k frequently they are obligated to report it as a judgement call.  So stupid but there isn't any real pattern to report it.  Unless you're a business that filed for a (forgot the form name) then you can't withdraw $3k or more throughout the week every week.  All in the name of laundering from drug dealers and terrorist.  Been that way since the mid 70s.  Stupid.  Hence OP post.  Need access to money 24x7 without BS regulations.

Funny.  I've been on PayPal hold for the last hour.  Another fucked up company that shouldn't exist. But unlike exchanges, there are things I use PayPal for that no one else offers.  I'd like to see a similar company with such an easy dispute resolution as them.  Only good thing about them.

If I had the money, why not just buy a shit ton to move the market up, then sell to bring it down?  Tomorrow do the same.  This throws dirt on what bitcoin is trying to accomplish.  How can people take it seriously when this happens?

Gemini active trader has been great. You're looking at around $65 fees for that amount. Great app also.
@_date: 2019-12-02 17:46:24
Lucky you.  I've had 3 major issues with them that have to be illegal.  Fool me once..fool me twice...fool me 3x goddamn it.  Really thought it was a minor fluke but it's clear they suck.  Twice they held my deposits for a month preventing me to withdraw or move coins off the exchange.  Complete bullshit.  Now they are giving the feds all kind of data with no clear reasoning.  Just case by case scenarios or  more likely algorithm which isn't public.

Ya. That sucks. They've told me it wouldn't be declined anymore after calling to verify yet the second or third buy will decline. Why buy with a card with those high fees though?

I store things offline but use Gemini exchange to initially purchase.  Just checked and in 2019 made 180 transactions with them and 0 issues.  They do updates on Thursday so it may be down.  But as a hodler, that doesn't matter.  Been very happy with their service and interface.

Patience. The coin has news that would jump a typical investment well into the green. Yet this keeps dropping because of panic sellers and miners or whales dumping large amounts. Fuck em. I bet a lot it'll jump to $15k by June.

When they tell you that you can't withdraw or move money for a month, then you'll switch.  I've had that happen twice.  Gemini has been great and has great reviews.

Could have a group of people suggest improvements. No better place than here. Off the bat I think the home page has items spaced out too much. Makes for a lot of blank page. 
The highlights of your service are on the front page but kind of lack information. To be able to click then to go to another page for more info would be nice. That or click on menu in upper right with a list of services with detail. I'll create an account to check it out. Thanks for making the crypto market better. If you decide to get a focus group, I'll take Bitcoin.
