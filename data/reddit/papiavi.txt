If $XVG (Verge coin) or $SC (Sia coin) hit $100 by end of 2018 I'll tattoo all
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:43:57
That's going to be my buy.... a Tesla......

Good one....let's hope for the best... ������������
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:38:59
Congratulations.....that's the way to do it....

Relax.... $BTC will go up and hit ath again....just a correction....while at it I also got me little bags of $XVG $XLM $XDN $RDD $SC $XRP not looking for overnight wealth....this is long term....if all of those go up to a 5% of what $BTC is right now..... I'll be good forever..... 
@_date: 2017-11-11 01:32:58
Thanks..... Hopefully..... that's when I'll get some
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:37:24
What goes up.....must come down for the correction
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:52:24
I just got back in.....going to go up soon
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:39:25
And it is at $5,700
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:44:41
I agree with all posts here..... specially the ones that call what you did "Your moon" ..... My moon is to pay for my kids' college.... Two of them....so we'll see....I'm not fortunate enough to have BTC like that... I wish I did..... But I've been buying BTC (little amonuts) and some Altcoins that I'll hold for a couple of years hoping that one goes up.....not like BTC but a small percentage of where BTC is at now....that would be enough for me. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 06:29:03
Not yet.... we'll see
@_date: 2017-11-16 02:16:03
I was thinking that....sell at $7500 and catch some more on the dip
@_date: 2017-11-13 15:33:14
I bought it at $5750.....how lucky....and I'm new to this
@_date: 2017-11-11 00:56:55
Congratulations......wow what a story
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:08:51
Hopefully I'm right.... ������
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:27:53
Wait for the dip....I see BTC dipping to $6600 ..... That's when I'm buying....big correction coming up.....
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:58:06
Let's see....hold it.... it'll go up...from what I'm reading... it'll go up....it has happened before
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:37:53
When will it be a good time to buy????  I'm thinking $5,700 ..... What do you think??
@_date: 2017-11-11 00:55:15
You don't think so
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:47:49
Now....when is the right time to sell???? And catch the next dip!!!! That's the real question.....
@_date: 2017-11-11 02:56:56
I don't know about that.....keeps going down.... might go down to $6K
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:45:02
I bought at $5750.....��������
@_date: 2017-11-15 19:07:42
I got me some at $5750.... ���� Now thinking when to do sell before another dip....to do the cycle again. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:12:29
Below $6,500..… 
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:41:48
That's what I'm doing..... it'll go back up...just a correction, that's all.... eventually it will go back up....
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:07:51
I don't even have that much in
@_date: 2017-11-11 02:57:35
I can see it at $6K... Maybe lower....
@_date: 2017-11-13 05:04:54
Back at $6000.... Up, up and away we go.....before we know it, will be back at over $7000
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:51:33
Told you....and I just bought some at $5,700....just like I said....now let's get that up swing
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:53:40
Damn.... it'll go up.... I'm sure.... I'm new to this but I've traded stocks before
@_date: 2017-11-13 05:32:37
Will be back at $7000 in no time....some jitters but it should be over now....
 altcoins are being pull with it.... My bags of $XDN $SC $XLM $RDD $XVG $XRP are all going up....��������
