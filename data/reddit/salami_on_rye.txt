If I was getting ready to invest $3.9mm, the first thing I'd do is go to Reddit to ask questions. So you've got that part down.

If the US government failed and the Internet was offline, Bitcoin would be useless. Things like food, potable water and guns &amp; ammo would be valuable. If you are wanting to "invest" to prepare for this type of scenario, you'd have better luck at and should be spending your money on rations, weapons, solar arrays, rural acreage, etc.
Also, Bitcoin specifically is a terrible currency. The transaction fees are too high, the number of transactions per second that can be executed are capped at 7, and so on. Bitcoin started out as an electronic currency but the problem is that having a totally public, distributed, trustless ledger just doesn't scale to the level where it can be used beyond a smallish group of people.

So why do you (and the myriad other posts on this subreddit) bemoan Coinbase and blame them for "attacking" bitcoin, then? Just don't do business with them. Let the free market sort it out.
@_date: 2018-01-12 19:21:22
If you were Coinbase, what would you do? Pay high fees so that your customers can efficiently move their BTC, or not pay high fees and have your customers' transactions get low priority?
Seems like they are damned if they do, damned if they don't.
In any event, if one entity can cause so much havoc, it makes you wonder about the resilience of Bitcoin in general, no?
@_date: 2018-01-01 22:58:01
You’re GDR it is. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 20:30:09
Agreed. This implies, then, that decentralized blockchains cannot scale.

The problem is when you're trying to solve real world problems, you need your head in the real world. You need to learn to crawl before you can walk. The aspiration for Bitcoin at this point should be to handle more than 7 transactions per second for less than dozens of dollars per transaction. Let's get that nailed down before we aspire to be bigger than Visa.
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:15:09


Why do you think that should be avoided? That would help focus a person's energy and drive on reducing expenses and increasing income, no?
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:13:34
The Lightning Network is basically a way for parties to create these "payment channels" on the blockchain, but then to transact among these channels without needing to record the transactions on the blockchain. So once the network is setup between parties, virtually instantaneous and free transactions can flow between them.
That's the promise, at least. It certainly has a number of issues and is still squarely in the realm of vaporware, IMO. 
Those in favor of it say that it will allow Bitcoin to scale orders of magnitude and allow for micropayments by making the transaction cost negligible. Those against it say that it creates a "centralized system" by moving transactions off-chain, and that it has implementation problems that will make it useless in real world scenarios (like the need to establish a channel to participate in the network).
In short, people have been saying, "Just wait until the Lightning Network!" for a long time now (years). 
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:16:13
Trust me, I concur. But it's not at all a functioning cash system today, not by a long shot. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 01:41:06
You don't go to prison for not paying your taxes. You go to prison for evading taxes (e.g., lying about your income to avoid having to pay tax).
If you can't pay taxes you setup a payment plan with the IRS. In the worst case, they seize your assets. But you will not go to prison if you are honest to the IRS about your taxes and your ability to pay what is owed. It's when you lie to the IRS that you can end up going to prison.

Sure, but at an extreme cost. It's just funny to see how far Bitcoin has morphed from a Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System to what it is today.

Same thing for owning 2.1 bitcoins. (It's actually less given dead coins and the fact that not all coins have been mined yet, but it gives it some perspective. And this is based off the fact that 2.1 bitcoins is 1/10,000,000th of all bitcoins that will ever exist. It's not to imply that 10,000,000 people each own 2.1 bitcoins.)

It is estimated that whoever Satoshi is, he (or she or they) have about 1 million Bitcoins. At $10k per coin that's $10 billion.

The core principle of fiat currency is that there's a government stating that "this currency has value" (because it's not backed by anything). 
A *fiat* is a formal declaration or decree. If there's no centralized entity (such as in the case of Bitcoin), it's hard to have any sort of formalized decree.
*Fiat currency* is currency declared valuable by the government. The government decrees that this otherwise worthless piece of paper has value.

Short answer: "Yes", with an "if"
Long answer: "No", with a "but".

No it's not. By definition, fiat money is money that is not backed by anything and is established as money *by government regulation*.

But that's true, technically.
If the guy who's paying you to mow his lawn says to you after you've finished, "Sorry, I can't afford to pay you after all." You just did work for free, no?
@_date: 2018-03-09 05:21:24
Well, they're half right.
@_date: 2018-03-18 22:32:32


That's what you'd think, but the guy who hired you was really a homeless person pretending to be the home owner. Kind of like unscrupulous con men who pretend to be honest businessmen and launch an ICO or run a crypto exchange. 


Sure, but a contract is not satisfied until both ends are met. So there is no past result to "how much I got paid for mowing the lawn" until after the point in time in which the yard was mowed and I was paid. 
Answer me this: if I am paid $20 in advance to mow the lawn, then never mow it, wouldn't you say, "The home owner paid $20 for nothing in return?" Yet you aren't agreeing that if we swap the order of those that I mowed the lawn for $0.
@_date: 2018-03-18 20:58:25
The homeowner has no more money left to pay you. Lost it all in crypto. So you can get a judgment but good luck collecting.

It cannot be a currency for technical reasons once the number of users exceeds a certain threshold. It's a technical paradox - spend it so it's useful as a currency, but don't spend too often or it won't be useful as a currency.

Draft a contract *after* you've already done the work (making that insightful post for which I paid you $5 billion)? Seems a little backwards to me.

The blockchain is neither necessary nor sufficient for a direct democracy. Could it be used in such a system? Sure, although I'd wager the costs far exceed the benefits.
But it's not like direct democracy can't happen without the blockchain. And it's not like a blockchain is the only thing needed for direct democracy.

@_date: 2018-02-05 19:20:23
It doesn't, not directly at least. It's because Bitcoin doesn't scale. Small blocks only allow a certain number of transactions through per block and if demand outstrips supply the transaction fee shoots up. If the fee BitPay is charging/paying doesn't follow suit, the transaction takes too long.
