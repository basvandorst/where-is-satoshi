Yeah Ive got a lot of the old MC999 messages. But like you said, its just my logo for the store...we will see how it goes but I just felt like switching it up a little. I paid ebay like 6-7k last year. Imagine how easy it would be to run that place. What could possibly go wrong while raping people legally? Thats why they could hire a chick as CEO (nothing against chicks, I need my breakfast cooked)...its pretty much impossible to fuck up at this point...they are a machine, and I hate having to do business with them. So this is how I act out

Well do you have a money transmitting license for selling bitcoins in NY? That could be a problem. Also, it looks like you are taking advantage of noobs. Coinbase price is $817 and your price is $860, yet you say zero fee. Well of course its zero fee...youre charging $40 above market price. So its like a back-handed fee. 
@_date: 2014-02-03 09:14:21
Its not a POS system and there is no card to be swiped. Are you not able to grasp that? Let me know it you have problems understanding this concept.

I think thats considered smart when it comes to sports
@_date: 2014-01-13 03:34:57
Umm judging by the ways most things are usually handled in this country. Im pretty sure its going to be a pain in the ass. And the regulations that are laid down, will not affect the fact that you could potentially use a bitcoin ATM to launder money. Therefore, information on bitcoin buyers will be needed. So either way, there wont be a lamassu in a tea shop. FINCen supercedes NY bitlicenses. Thats all im saying
@_date: 2014-01-30 03:59:17

@_date: 2014-01-13 05:46:36
haha that is a lot of extra work for a tea shop barista...all these records have to be kept on file and all that. Its going to be a nightmare and I wish it wasnt...but i just dont see it happening. Like I said, I have one of these coming and finding a place for it will be nearly impossible. Ill probably have to sell it to a free country like Switzerland
@_date: 2014-01-14 23:31:45
Dude chill out...they subsidize your payment with advertisements in your face. THis would make owning bitcoin or another virtual currency a necessity so it may be a decent tradeoff for me.
@_date: 2014-01-08 18:48:19
What do you mean, host it? You would probably have to be with the machine. And whatever state you find, you need the MSB license which is a nightmare with the robocoin as it does both flows of currency. I hope you have done your homework. Its really really expensive

@_date: 2014-01-12 19:14:08
No this isnt going to happen...and the first bitcoin ATM went to Atlanta and its still in the guys apartment cause he cant get his license...never in NY. And who is going to keep track of transaction? You have to get ID from the people that stick money in the machine...id say a year till this is up minimum
@_date: 2014-01-13 01:21:03
yeah but you dont pay the whole bond. You pay a monthly fee. Like if the bond was 50k, you would pay like 1500 a year from what I understand. Even with a bitlicense, someone still has to monitor it an collect information from people who buy bitcoin. That is not up to the state of NY, that is a federal regulation.
@_date: 2014-01-05 13:51:33

Where's CEO brianarmstrong on this one? He seems to only comment when its good press regarding Coinbase
@_date: 2014-01-25 02:21:12
It says $1 on it but the dollar buys less...its called shrinkflation. Where it doesnt necessarily lose value, but the companies that take it give you less product for it. Have you opened a bag of chips lately? Do you see many $1 dollar menus these days? Why not? Your dollar still says $1 on it...its because it aint worth shit anymore, cause they print over 2 Billion a day. So instead of just raising prices which could cause a backlash Like the subway 11inch sub. They decide to just pull the wool over the dumb people that say to themselves "doh, it still says $1 on it dohhh"...and that is why there is no hope. People are just too stupid these days to realize what is going on...and thats the ultimate plan. 
@_date: 2014-01-02 22:23:01

@_date: 2014-01-01 01:33:03
I asked, lets see if they will comment
Does Coindesk wish to make a statement?
You may have heard about HashFast/HashScam not fulfilling mining orders that were promised to buyers as early as October. This seems like a big story, not that Clipperz accepting bitcoin isnt. Its just we feel it's worth reporting to keep other people from getting...well frankly totally fucked. Coindesk has been accused by many in the community of being in bed with mining companies, and not reporting negative press because of possible fiduciary agreements.  Do you care to comment and defend your company?
"You should ask the main bitcoin news sources the reason for this (CoinDesk, anyone thinks that CoinDesk isn't in the payroll of almost every scam in Bitcoin?)"
@_date: 2014-01-07 20:32:25
haha, its the color of bitcoin...gold. I love this part. "The typical user has been profiled as a tech-savvy male, age 25 to 40, with above-average income, commonly residing on one of the U.S. coasts, according to Colas."

@_date: 2014-02-04 08:38:29
Im not going to argue about all this. A card issued with a bitcoin account would help a lot with mass adoption. Everyone knows what bitpay does...no one was talking about bitpay. And Ive never seen a $25 dollar tablet. You must have the hookup
@_date: 2014-01-09 11:57:41
Well Im in LA now, but Im from Florida and will be moving back in a month or so. Im trying to get something going there ideally. But my mom grew up in Charleston, and its one of those towns where everyone knows your name. So she is very well connected. When I heard SC requires no license at all, I began to explore. If the college of charleston kids could buy their blow with bitcoin, it could really take off though. Yeah, and whats more amazing is the naivety of some of these people that think, "ok, im going to buy a bitcoin ATM. "Any suggestions on where to put it?" Someone says San Francisco, "yeah, we were thinking about that." As if, they honestly think they were the first to think of San Fran. Get a clue...They have no idea how hard it is and how expensive it is to comply with regulation, especially in Cali. Where are you located?

@_date: 2014-01-12 21:54:48
Yeah it will probably cost around 150k just to meet regulations. And it sure as hell wont work in a tea shop. You cant just buy bitcoins without an identity. That is the whole point of FINCen and why you have to register at Coinbase. It will be in this guys apartment. The same place mine will be, and the same place the guys from atlanta bitcoins. Hes had his since November.

Thats total garbage and why you dont this kind of business with overseas players.

The CEO responds a lot of the time. They care, and try their best. Now its costing you money, so its probably a wash switching at this point

Well by accepting bitcoin, you are cutting out a lot of fees. And that is good for any declining company obviously. Makes sense for overstock, as their profit margin is around 1 or 2 percent. Any company that accepts bitcoin is great for bitcoin.

Is that Coinkite POS machine $1000?? That is a ripoff...However, this isnt about the customer Mr Historian, its about the merchant and the average IQ of a cashier. A) Bitcoin isnt scaling to the point of mass adoption transactions. Visa alone does something like 5,000 per second, even more i think. There are only 7 transactions a second in bitcoin so they often get bottlenecked, so payment isnt always instant which is a flaw in bitcoin. So the average merchant Im sure would feel a lot more comfortable swiping a tangible item, rather than the customer using their smart phone. Moreover, it gives the merchant someone to call if shit hits the fan. There is no one to call with a wallet service. There are just too many things that could go wrong. Unlike swiping a credit card and everything is instant or there is a company the merchant can call to figure it out. B) There was just a post on reddit where some dude went to a nice steak joint and tried to pay in bitcoin. The owner told him to scan the QR code posted and send the payment. Well 30 minutes went by and nothing...turns out someone had 2 sided taped another QR code over the correct one. So the guy had to pay again...i think cops were called.  I know this has nothing to do with the tablet, but its something that would be avoided with a card. So yeah, coinkite sucks for charging 50 bucks, but something like that is much more convenient for a merchant and would help with mass adoption in my opinion.

Those businesses you speak of, guns and alcohol. Can you buy a gun at a tea shop? Can you buy alcohol at a tea shop? No, you buy a gun at a gun store and liquor at a liquor store for a reason. The reason this is done is because of regulations. So I doubt you would buy bitcoins at a tea shop. Unless that tea shop completely changes its business plan. The 150k is for the lawyers, licensing fees, and bond payment. You have to carry a 500k bond in NY. It would make more sense for a check cashing place or even western union to add one. Trust me dude, if it was easy, it wouldnt have taken this long.

I think a lot of people are very interested in San Francisco. There is a reason there isnt one there yet right? The license bond you need is different for each state.

Probably wont turn a profit for 2 years at least.

No its the public key. If you were going to deposit money into your bitcoin wallet at an ATM, you would flash your public QR code on your phone, right? That means opening up your wallet app, entering your long password with 2 factor-auth most likely, and maybe your phone is low on batteries. Well you dont need to do all that. You just pull out your AmBit ATM card and the ATM scans your bitcoin  wallet address and deposits the coins. Its so much less hassle.

The bronze membership is .03 btc depending on value...$5 fiat essentially. I wasnt trying to gain members by this post. I am simply looking for knowledgable bitcoiners to possibly help out for recognition. They have a lobbyist in washington, yes, thats great. I have not mentioned all of the perks of being a member for a reason. Do you go to the bitcoin foundation daily? You will come to The ABC daily when we are live.
I have a personal grudge with BFL, and I read an article they donated 21,000 BTC to the foundation about 6 months ago. I saw that as them basically giving everyone who bought miners bitcoins away. It took me a year to get a 60 G/H and it was obviously obsolete by then. They did nothing to try and make it right, like say KNC and other mining companies do now. Its just bad business and I dont respect that.
@_date: 2013-11-02 22:23:32
Have you been to the bitcoin foundation? Is there anything at all to do there thats fun or informational? Did I miss something? Have you seen how much it costs to be a member? Plus, the founders of Dark Wallet just released a video on crowdfunder.com saying Bitcoin Foundation was on the governments side to bring regulation, and we are NOT. Lastly, Butterfly labs is a major player in that foundation and that company literally makes me sick to even think about.

Yes, i can see why you would ask that. The actual company is American Bitcoin Inc. The acronym stands for The American Bitcoin Company which is the brand. The Association is a branch of the American Bitcoin Brand, which is of course Trademarked. Thanks
@_date: 2013-11-02 00:37:16
Yes, but bitcoin hasnt picked up enough steam yet...it will and QR codes will too. There are companies investing millions trying to get QR codes more widely used, and it will happen eventually I believe. QRs only really came out about 2 years ago. Give them some time

haha touche! Its like the Opera i guess

Just raised 1.20 in the past 30 seconds with the sale of a Silver card. Great Start! If the link is sold, you can find the selection of cards here.

This is not a party. This is my business and I take it seriously. Thanks for explaining...I can not express enough the fact that i dont care at all. 
@_date: 2013-11-27 05:33:01
Well litecoin was developed by the CEO of BTCChinas brother, right? That could mean something in the future? Something else has to catch on. What will the less fortunate have? .2 btc...thats not sexy? There has to be something else...how is Panama?
@_date: 2013-12-02 04:07:51
Who would down vote this, its a pretty big deal...REDDIT TROLLS!!
@_date: 2013-11-24 21:11:59
However secure your wallet address is. You can provide a read only address from something like armory for deposits only. Or a basic wallet address with small amounts just for accepting bitcoin from customers or friends you trust. It can also replace a paper wallet to add more durability for your cold cold storage options.
@_date: 2013-11-02 22:37:37
I really beg to differ...i think your little troll hastiness took over...but we are all entitled to our opinion.
@_date: 2013-12-02 16:36:42
haha it cost me 3...but im a better bitcoiner for it
@_date: 2013-12-07 05:20:56
Time to cashout? What, is trading suspended? Cash out, and dont let the door hit you on the way out. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 00:47:22
I like it, I lost 1 bitcoin before i wised up but that was a while ago. They should be sued for how easy it is for peoples accounts to be hacked
@_date: 2013-12-18 12:14:06
its a funny comment, I upvoted. However, I am bullish on bitcoin so that 50 dollars spent, should be 150 by March
@_date: 2013-11-02 02:47:31
Yeah but a lot of American newcomers wont see it that way. Americans like to spend money in America for the most part. Its an American Bitcoin Brand. I have to send a product in the mail!! I cant send cards all over the world and expect people to want to pay for them. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 21:30:53
I bought a lot at 200, it went to 400, then dropped 300 so I sold. Then bought back in at 325. I learned my lesson and you will too. Just hold, and everything works out.
@_date: 2013-11-02 03:12:32
exactly...thank you..and in Australia 
@_date: 2013-11-02 02:06:55
And American Apparel is considered garbage here and bankrupt...funny how that worked. Umm, well yeah as I stated, I want people to buy the novelty card, and participate in the fun stuff. So shipping them all over the world would be costly, and I dont know what is popular in other countries so I couldnt relate anyway. Just trying to get more Americans involved so everyone keeps getting richer...like what happened because of china 
@_date: 2013-11-02 02:43:43
haha i was like, there is nothing there..I mean i got what you were saying and youre right. But for some reason or another everyone has a QR app downloaded but just dont use it.
@_date: 2013-11-02 00:09:29
And the key is feeling a part of something. The money donated gets you a tangible product as well as a good chance of getting your donation back a number of ways. My point is to make bitcoin fun for current users and get new users a place to find information more easily...the more people buying bitcoins, the more they are worth. So im trying to help out the community and give away a trademarked useful product in the process. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 20:28:19
What does that mean? Its just the truth
@_date: 2013-12-07 05:19:36
I hate when people dont know the difference between "lose" and "loose". These are two different words...this isnt a too, to, or two situation. 
@_date: 2013-11-03 00:22:04
My mistake
@_date: 2013-12-24 21:49:50
you probably dont watch football. Google tom brady high five and there are about 100 articles about it. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 03:53:56
Interesting idea, the only flaw would be keeping track of who paid and who didnt. Busy restaurants/servers could miss payments. People would probably just get up and leave saying "hey, we paid bitcoin". Then just claim the transaction didnt go thru. I just think restaurants are less likely adopt something like that and more open to a POS system of some sort. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 11:56:33
I like the memes...remember that GIF of Colbert with the 3D glasses on eating popcorn? Post was " man I love watching these charts" or something...brilliant. They are usually funny, and who cant use a good laugh at these times? I like them
@_date: 2013-11-02 00:42:48
I hear ya, but you are a very small # of people. A lot of foreigners like the US and our culture. The US is the 2nd biggest bitcoin mining country in the world, so yeah, thats who i want...and the people that like America. have fun at bitcoin forum..that site is awesome and gives back so much...really looks great too..pshhh
@_date: 2013-11-03 04:36:18
Its not even close to a regulatory board...thats pretty much the last thing it is...
@_date: 2013-11-02 03:13:52
Just like this...  
@_date: 2013-11-02 00:05:05
Well the question is, where do you go to get your information now?
@_date: 2013-11-05 06:52:26
So would most agree, that the safest way for the non computer savvy bitcoin holder to store bitcoins is to open a coinbase account and have the text verification code set up for login purposes?

well as long as it shows up in my twitter feed im cool with that
@_date: 2013-11-02 01:29:29
I understand, but I didnt snap. I was simply stating everyone uses American products everyday...apple is like the most widely known company in the world. It doesnt say American but everyone knows they are american. I just felt like you were offended because I named it after a powerful country that some people dont like. I am trying to get more Americans involved by giving them a name they already know and trust. American Bitcoin its the easiest name to remember, and America is trusted all over the world. These fly by night bitcoin companies in other countries that rip people off would not last one second in America. The moderators would be tracked down and arrested. The site will have perks for foreigners as well. The ABBBB will have a list of all of the companies, where members can write reviews like a Yelp! feature, and file complaints. With a strong user database something like bad reviews being broadcasted can be very detrimental and can help a lot of people out. Im trying to remove the guessing work from bitcoin and help people. So if youre against it, youre against bitcoin becoming more legitimate and more widely used...thats all im saying
@_date: 2013-11-02 00:22:45
I understand your concern. However, Americans being the biggest consumers on earth per person is why its American. I am gearing this toward Americans. The card itself is a parody of American Express, which is an American Company yet is used and accepted all of the world.  Most bitcoin sites are hosted in countries that a lot of Americans do not trust. Plus, I will be sending something in the mail, so shipping to other countries could prove more costly. This has nothing to do with a government. The people of America are for the most part sick of the propaganda as well. This is just to assure people that we are American, we are incorporated, and we are to be trusted. Im sorry you feel that way, but i do understand
@_date: 2013-11-02 23:53:15
Yeah I threw it on there for fun to see if I could sell some memberships. It is totally self funded. Like I said, its almost done. Im just offering a membership card to fund the high paying faucets, weekly contests and giveaways. I am using membership fees to make it fun and worth visiting everyday, maybe 3 times a day. And in return for your fee, you see its 5 dollars for a year, then down to 2-3 usd fiat a year for renewal.... We also operate bitpledge.com and some money would go to developing that after The ABC is established. We are trying to get bitcoins to the less fortunate. I have made a lot of money off of bitocoins the past few weeks and a lot of other people have too...so it given away more freely and can obviously be given is very small increments. Our lawyer is on retainer thru a brick and mortar business in Orlando. He is considered more of a friend at this point and helps out where we need. 
@_date: 2013-11-05 06:48:23
haha, noted!
@_date: 2013-12-18 12:04:59
I am right there with you. Bitcoin is unregulated and so should be the platforms we voice our opinions on. Youre acting like the overly anal parents who complain what is on TV. All you have to do is change the channel...really a big part of what is wrong with society today. The memes can be funny and everyone needs a good laugh around these times. Bitcoin will be fine in the long run...if youre worried, youre in it for the money, you dont believe in bitcoin and should just sell anyway.
@_date: 2013-11-03 00:10:18
Im assuming that is in regards to the wired article, where the homeless guys working for bitcoin are not homeless anymore. If so, yes just like that. That was also my goal behind bittakers.com actually. Anyone in the world can sign up and sell what they have to offer for bitcoins. Like a craigslist for bitcoins, and its all self funded and free to sign up. I dont need to make money off of these sites, and thats not my goal in the slightest. I own bitcoin, and I hope thats all i ever need.

I get that, but PBR is shit. Whats the Saint Bernardus of porn? Seeing Kim Kardashian get banged? Thats free too. There is just so much free porn out there that its like getting PBR, Shocktop, blue moon, and all the others are free too. There is way too much that isnt free that warrants money being spent on to waste it on porn.  But to each his own. I personally just think its silly
