I disagree - to get your money off-chain requires the opening of a multi-sig, which then allows many transactions later on without double-spending. Stores won't do this. They'll just offer in-store credit like they've been doing for years. Buy a $50 Starbucks card with Bitcoin, wait 10 min for it to activate, and from then on buying a coffee takes 0 seconds, has 0 transaction fees, and every 10 payments earns you free coffee. The beauty of this is that it inherently encourages decentralization of store credit, rather than the centralisation on LN. Businesses will prefer it whether LN exists or not.
Also, business have been taking cheques for years, and checks bounce all the time. One doesn't even need to have money in the account at all when writing a cheque, making it an easier attack than a bitcoin double-spend. Businesses do just fine accepting cheques, because all they need to do is add a $0.50 insurance fee for processing cheques, and everything works out fine.
TL;DR, One shouldn't make compromises so early on for perceived future benefits. Only compromise when you absolutely have to. Let's not over-engineer the protocol just when it's getting popular.

Bitcoin changed. It now has SegWit. Bitcoin Cash does not. You can't say that having an 8MB block size is a change worthy of being an alt-coin, because Bitcoin used to have an 8MB block size in the past.
The only thing Bitcoin Cash has that Bitcoin didn't have 4 years ago is some minor fixes like the quadratic scaling issue. So yeah, i can see why one might want to think of Bitcoin Cash as an alt-coin to Bitcoin, and i'd give that opinion some credence, but to say "Bitcoin hasn't changed" when we're days away from a never-before-seen modification to the protocol is equine poop.

That bit I genuinely didn't know. OK. I look forward to seeing what the future holds for LN :)
@_date: 2017-08-11 19:12:14


No, this isn't true. The reason Bitcoin Cash exists is because SegWit is a huge change to the protocol, and it should have been introduced with either 95% consensus, or as a hard-fork. The much sneekier option was chosen, to introduce it by using existing Bitcoin things in ways they were not intended to be used. This is one of the main reasons SegWit is seen as insecure. When you essentially hide a hard-fork (non-compatible protocol) inside the existing protocol you open yourself up to all kinds of trouble.
Bitcoin Cash hard-forked because SegWit didn't. Bitcoin Cash is basically the same Bitcoin that it's always been.
This whole issue of block size is something totally different. Bitcoin cash could have hard-forked without it, and Bitcoin could implement it with a hard fork. It's not part of the discussion. It's only part of the discussion because SegWit's authors claimed it increases the effective size of the block chain by 60%, which is true, but 60% of 1Mb is fuck all, and it's only UP TO 60%. If no one uses SegWit transaction on Bitcoin then there will be no effective increase in block chain size. It was a total distraction to the main issue - no longer hashing witnesses of each transaction.
@_date: 2017-08-28 22:29:26
But doesn't a blockchain that only goes up to 1Mb have to create more blocks and thus has more overhead than a blockchain that can process more tx's per block? I guess all that matters is the number of transactions per minute no?
@_date: 2017-08-11 08:36:06
To the Bitcoin Cash crowd, BTC is using the name of BCH, since BCH is BTC without the new SegWit and with a small block size increase instead. It's all a matter of perspective.
@_date: 2017-08-28 11:27:28
Bitcoin Cash is less different than Bitcoin to what Bitcoin was 1 year ago. They see SegWit as a corruption of Bitcoin, and calling bitcoin cash "bcash" a corrupting of even the name.
bcash is also the name of a totally separate coin that has nothing to do with bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-28 11:34:54
Because Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin without the new SegWit code. If SegWit fails, Bitcoin Cash becomes Bitcoin, officially.
@_date: 2017-08-28 11:41:11
That would be Bitcoin Cash then :/
Most hashing power and most blocks..
@_date: 2017-08-28 20:12:19
My mistake, your right about the 5:1 hashpower. I've been drinking someone's coolaid apparently :/

The insanity of these posts is that Bitcoin Cash is 99.9% similar to Bitcoin.

As a merchant who accepts bitcoin and altcoins, i'm sure adoption and test cases will be difficult to come by. It's too risky for a company to keep too much of it's income tied up in bitcoin, as if the coin halves in value overnight then the business is screw'd.
I know it's not a popular opinion, but as a merchant we have to cash-out of bitcoin as quickly as possible, as all of our contracts are in euro. As such, lightning hubs are very problematic for us. I want to accept bitcoin in lieu of payment in euros, but i don't want to have large chunks of my company's income floating on the eur/btc exchange.
Even without lightning networks, we would have times when we couldn't pay our contractors what we owed as the value of the currency dipped. "Can we pay you when the value of bitcoin rebounds?" just isn't OK in business.

I don't think you fully understand how PoW is supposed to work. It's not supposed to be something everyone can do. Nodes, sure, but mining is supposed to be something that costs a lot of money, skill, and electricity to perform.
The centralisation of miners is built into the protocol. If you don't like that use a cryptocurrency with a different approach (proof of stake, random PoW assignment), but all of them have a weaker security model than bitcoin.

What's wrong with ASICs again? It's the most efficient way to hash. It's the nuclear bomb that ends the arms race.
@_date: 2017-10-22 15:33:55


That's how you *want* bitcoin to work, but that's not how bitcoin works. Read the whitepaper. Unless you contribute work to the system (by mining) you're not helping. You could run 10,000 virtual full nodes on a macbook air at the cost of 1 real full node's work. All nodes prove is that an IP address is owned, and governments own a substantially large number of IP addresses. The only people that matter on the bitcoin network are the miners who participate in PoW.
Nodes don't provide security to the network, the provide security to the individual running the node, in that they know what's going on on the network and don't have to rely on someone else's full node telling them.

oh wow people actually say this
@_date: 2017-10-21 20:29:27


I'm assuming that because i can't afford large settlement fees unless i'm settling a lot


Yeah that's a good point. If that's how the exchange does it, i'm all in. Although, i'm not sure this really solves the problem, as now the exchange has to take all the risk of the fluctuating btc/eur conversion, and the entire hub might go down if there's a small dip.

This is a philosophical point of contention between the design of Bitcoin and what most people think is the end goal. It isn't designed such that hobbyists can contribute, because all the hobbyists in a country will not be able to compete with their government in terms of hardware and skill. Only for-profit companies can compete with governments, and indeed, only non-profit companies can compete with for-profits, since they are often tax-free. This is the ultimate end of the mining question. Various open non-profit, tax-exempt (but open account books) companies continuously competing to be number 1.

Right, but this will have to be done in batch, not per transaction. This is a problem, because the price of btc to euro might drop by 50% between selling them a beer and cashing that beer into euros. And i can't pay staff/other companies in Bitcoin.
Assume the settlements on the blockchain are $1000 as a previous commenter speculated. I'm going to be settling in the 10s if not 100s of thousands of euros with my hub processor at that point. Meaning the valuation of bitcoin at the moment of settlement will be more important to my company than the customers served that month, or what promotions we did, etc. You just can't run a business like that, with that much risk/volatility. If i was paying staff and buying materials in btc it would be fine, but employees need to be paid monthly.
You can't place a large amount of a small/medium sized company's assets (with which it will pay staff) on a btc/eur exchange. It's not only just nerve-wracking for the owner, but it's probably illegal under employment law in the EU. Regulators will see it as gambling with staff pay.
I need customers to pay X euros worth of bitcoin for a beer, to pay X-Y euros to my staff. If the value of btc to eur goes down, i can't just hold for a week. I think, if a lot of companies end up floating in eur/btc exchanges, you're going to see dips in btc value put hundreds if not thousands of small companies out of business overnight, dropping the value of btc further. Until staff and supplies are billed in btc, the btc to euro conversion has to happen near-instantly. I need to make money even when the value of btc to euro is going down.

How long did it take you to learn bitcoin :/

hang on. In order for guy A to trade with guy B $6k for 1btc, guy A has to give the exchange 1btc and guy B $6k. The exchange takes a cut of either the euros or bitcoin. The numbers can change, the exchange will still make profit whatever the trade is.
But if an exchange has to pay a vendor $6000 but was only ever given 0.5btc (because at the time of their trade, a week ago, it was $12,000 euro per btc), then where is it going to get that extra money from? It's not, basically. It will have to be absorbed by the exchange. Exchanges will basically end up being insurers, in the sense that they promise to pay the retailer the euro cost at the time of the trade. That's not in bitcoin history.

ooooh, ok, i see now. I didn't get that bit.
You're right, i'm wrong, it's all good :)

Orphaned blocks are not a problem, they are part of the block reward free market. Each miner has to decide how big they want their blocks to be, as bigger == more likely to get orphaned. But whatever that relationship is (and it will be different for different miners in different parts of the world) is up to the miners to figure out.
tl;dr orphaned blocks and latency aren't part of the argument, because the 'cost' of such blocks are included in the cost of mining, total.

I don't understand why this is hard for you nor why you immediately start by saying i don't understand how an instantaneous trades work. It's really really simple.
User A has Xbtc, user B has Yeur. They trade X-Z for Y, or Y-Z for X, where Z is the exchange's cut off the top.
Now the 'value' of Z can change as btc/eur change in value, but whatever happens, the exchange is walking away from the trade with more money than it had going in.
With a delay however, the exchange is buffering the transaction. It appears instantaneous, but it's not *actually* instantaneous, as it takes time for the payment channel to conclude. But i need euros right now to pay staff. So either I or the exchange needs to have some liquid money to buffer this delay, but that buffer - which will likely be hundreds of thousands of euros - will be subject to the btc/eur market fluctuations. That is a problem. This needs an insurance company to predict the risk of lose and factor that into it's exchange rates.
I'm not saying it's impossible, i'm just saying that this gets complicated really quickly, and prices out small/medium business or exchanges pretty quickly.
