Anybody can become "press"... would you like someone to investigate you behind the curtain of "free press" and publish anything and any recordings they find or create? There's a reason why there are privacy laws that counter a totally free press.

It really depends on who the Dems put up for 2020 and what their message is going to be. I'll reserve my predictions post-2018. Plus, the establishment dems are still continually ignoring the schism that occurred in their party.

Have you lost your way from r/politics? FYI, a significant portion of early bitcoiners prob did or would have voted Trump...that's how I got into bitcoin as a former uberlib and learned more about the US' disastrous monetary policy from these OGs. The only politicians I knew who were not denouncing bitcoin or treating it like a joke in 2012 were pol like Rand and Mulvaney, who are both pretty close to Trump. Even Newt Gringrinch bought bitcoin for his kids. AFAIK, neolib politicians are ignoring bitcoin, hoping that it's a bubble that disappears and leftists are hoping it's going to create a socialist utopia (which it most def won't bring).

I don't know if he's being completely honest in this interview. Bitcoin is different in that institutional investors and professionals are competing with or getting in after retail investors. In the traditional way, VCs/angel investors would provide the startup capital, banks like GS would create the IPO and trade it, institutional funds would invest, and only then did retail investors have the chance to come in, but they also got the least profit or got rekt buying the top since everyone before them took profits. Bitcoin was accessible to everyone right from the beginning and I think a lot of professionals traders/investors are pretty salty about that or want to suppress the price to enter with a good position.

It worked well for the prior administrations (esp the last one w/ bailouts, endless quantitive easing, and near zero interest rates just for banks that allowed them to scoop up undervalued assets). The funny thing is that Woodward is making it clear that the only people who are considered deserving of low interest rates are those who are politically connected. If Woodward is trying to turn Trump’s base against him, pointing out that America only hands out printed money to the politically-connected is probably a suboptimal way to go about it. It's amazing that these people still don't understand why there's populism.
@_date: 2018-09-12 08:20:52
Eh, I remember reading this Slate article on Woodward during the controversy of his claim that an Obama official threatened him for revealing details of a meeting. He did the same thing when writing the biography of John Belushi, and every person written about in that book did not agree w/ the way Woodward used their quotes to characterize Belushi. 


@_date: 2018-09-12 07:51:19
Why? He basically wants what all prior administrations had except to expand it to people like me, who are not politically-connected, to have low-interest rates that banks and the politically-connected have gotten for decades, especially after '08. Do you know what those people/banks have been doing the past 10years w/ all the newly printed QE dollars? Buying every undervalued asset while most people were struggling. I know I'd rather have a million qualified people get the chance to purchase an asset like a house at a low interest rate than Goldman Sachs buying up a million SFH w/ free printed money only to rent or sell them when interest rates start going up, profiting off the cycle they helped manufacture. 
Trump's just revealing the benefits of what the elites like him got.

There's a reason why the corporate tax cut is permanent and the individual tax cuts are not. Of course, Congress could vote to make the individual tax cuts permanent when they come back from Christmas recess... all they would need is 10 Dem senators to agree to those individual tax cuts... doesn't even have to be the rest of the bill. And it's going to expire in 2025... if the Dems are in power by then, it's highly likely they'll sign it themselves since it would make them extremely unpopular to raise taxes on the middle class.
Anyways, budget rules required that permanent individual tax cuts required 60 votes, but permanent corporate tax cut only required 50 votes. It has to do with reconciliation and limitations on massive revenue changes. Since the CBO scored a drop in revenue of 1.5 Trillion over ten years; the Republicans had to make the taxes have an expiration. If they didn't; they couldn't pass the law via reconciliation. In which case the Democrats would have filibustered the bill indefinitely (as they have promised for every Republican initiative).
Republicans asked Democrats to come to the table to help them with this reform and they were told no. Which is not surprising as Democrats want to raise taxes, not lower them. They also have a vested interest in seeing the Republican agenda fail as it will boost their gains in 2018.
So without Democrats willing to vote on anything that Republicans are pursuing; this is their best bet. On top of which even if Democrats are in power these expire they would be stupid to let them happen. Any congress that lets it happen will be directly responsible for a tax hike; and that never bodes well for them. Which is why Democrats and Obama made Bush's tax cuts permanent (except some of the higher tax brackets were increased).

It's not so much the protection from rape gangs that I think is the problem, it's the outright denial, victim blaming, and ostracization of the victims (who were children, mind you) when they approached authorities time and time and time and time again that led to decades of abuse and coverups. Even worse is that they labeled these children as racists, sluts, or druggies. Also, this abuse was already brought up my the Sikh community in the 80s... and those victims were also ignored or ostracized.

Most likely.. bin Salman wants to change KSA from its current theocracy to a more tolerant society ... the future of KSA depends on it bc ever since 2014 it's been apparent that they can no longer continue being a petro welfare state that also protects Islamic fundamentalism without going bankrupt ... his plan to make Aramaco a public company gives them opportunities to diversify their economy and open themselves to the rest of the world... that can't happen when pple are killed and oppressed for not following the right religion.

You're basically an example what Sagan wrote about - a person who adopts the opinions of the media that decides how you should think and what you should be outraged about. 
This belief --&gt; "it was when the right decided to attack and belittle intellectuals and scientists" &lt;-- you think you thought of yourself has been propagandized by the media and partisans who want to protect the status quo, especially the last few years to cover up the problems resulting from American's deindustrialization and simultaneous increased financialization of the economy, which has further increased inequality.

Right, commies are the last group of pple I would associate w/ bitcoin. 1) They can't create a central authority to control it, 2) It's impossible to seize bitcoin from pple to redistribute it
If anything, the increased success of bitcoin lowers the chance of communism or socialism from ever succeeding (not that it ever has...)

Oh totally. The establishment created a nice, likable package w/ Obama. People, including me, thought they were voting for a progressive, but he ended up being in the pocket of bankers. Why else would JP Morgan executives have a say on who his Cabinet members would be months before the 2008 presidential election even occurred? And every single Cabinet member chosen was on the list that was given to his team. And that's just the beginning of all the sneaky, backhanded things his admin did while the media wasn't checking him.
