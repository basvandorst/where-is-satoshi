No ragrets so far...  bought at 17k, then at 11 thinking that was bottom.  Then again at 8 as it started going up.  My total investments are finally worth a few hundred more than I have spent.  Now I just need something to spend this currency on, I have no intention of ever converting it back to Fiat, only to buy more.

Wow, i bought another 500 cdn worth yesturday, first time its gone UP after I bought some...
Now I just need more places/people to accept Bitcoin (in my regular routine) as much as everyone is like Hodl, if we don't use bitcoin, it will never grow.  The more we use it, the more buisness will adopt, the more buisness adopt, the more people will use it, the more people use it, the greater than demand...  So Hodl all you want, but using it will increase its value more.

I believe hodl is not the answer, but rather spend.  If we start using btc as currency, more retailers will start accepting it as currency, and that will cause exponential growth.  While the first rise was all speculation, the next big rise will be on the back of adoption.  So, don't sell your BTC, spend your BTC.

I don't think I have a moon.  I am not buying bitcoin to later convert it back to fiat.  I want to use it, I want to be part of the currency revoulution that reshapes how goods and services are exchanged.  I want my grandkids to learn in school of the currency systems of the past and think  they were silly and not believe thats how the world used to work.  I do want my investment today to be worth more tommorow, I wanna regret not buying more today.
