When you buy bitcoin for that $25 you will end up with something like .002 BTC. So just take whatever the future price of bitcoin is and multiply it by .002 and you have the value of your initial investment.

When this re-opens will the price likely go down or up?
@_date: 2017-12-24 00:11:51
Still about a 25% discount right now tbh. I would expect it to be back up to 20k by new years so this is just free money.

If only there were exchanges and people didnt need to try and shadily buy and sell BTC in person like a drug dealer then wonder why people are trying to scam you.
If someone is selling or buying BTC on localbitcoins.com it should be huge red flag that there is something shady happening. You can do this from the confort of your home if you feel the need to meet in a back alley to buy or sell BTC expect to get scammed.
@_date: 2018-05-22 14:53:03
LOL because Richard Heart started his own ICO to make more BTC. He basically admitted as much when he was on Doug Polks podcast.

Don't hodl  "crypto", hodl BTC. Dump your altcoins as soon as you can take profits and accumulate more BTC. 
IMO If you believe alt coins can be successful along side BTC in the future then you dont believe in sound money, and you are in favor of the same inflationary fractional reserve financial system we have now. The 21 million hard cap on BTC is pointless if all these different alt coins will co-exist with BTC. 
 
The alts will all eventually die a fiery death and you dont want to be holding bags when that day comes because there will be NO buyers.
There are only 2 possible outcomes:
1. BTC dominates everything and altcoins go to 0
2. 1 alt coin "succeeds" and brings BTC and All of crypto down with it. The End of all Crypto Currency forever.
Shamelessly dump your bags of altcoins when you can and HODL BTC for dear life.

Tone Vays uses his own indicators that hardly anyone else uses and they are always wrong. I hate his system of TA tbh.
Some TA can give you slight statistical edge in trying to determine price action but that is all it is going to do. Even large proponents of TA will tell you that no one can predict the price action.

If im sending BTC from a Ledger Nano or Blockchain.info wallet, can I select my transaction fees when I send?
For example, lowest fee for longer transaction time, higher fee for fast transaction?

While I agree that Bitcoin would be fine and live on, its not technically correct that "the night side would be fine". The charged particles heading toward the earth from the sun would actually come down through the poles and cause the sky to light up all around the globe in the Northern and Southern most latitudes. If you were outside at night during this event the sky would light up with bright colors.

I dont understand why you lost 55% of your BTC
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:14:04
Do you remember anything about the process? Where you originally bought from, was the wallet you sent to online? etc.
If you leave those details here someone might be able to help you remember. (Maybe you would even tip that person BTC for their troubles ;)
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:00:16
I have a Ledger coming in today and am confused by this, can you explain that again? If he had sent a larger amount initially would the change address be necessary? Why wouldn't it just work like my blockchain.info wallet when sending?

Well I just transferred my cash balance from my coinbase account so it was instant with no fees.
I have no idea how long it would have taken otherwise.

Something like this is what I mean and is what most people here that are serious use: 
It is possible to store them on your HD but what if you brick your PC? That is almost more risky then an exchange IMO.

If I removed my coins from coinbase before the fork I would not get any correct?
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:45:15
You can buy your BTC on coinbase without worrying about being scammed. 
However, once you have it in your coinbase wallet you should transfer it to a hardware wallet or at least off of the exchange because technically coinbase still owns that bitcoin and they could shut down or be hacked at any time, etc.
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:25:42
Hodl on buddy you will make it back.
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:45:19
1. Buy Bitcoin from exchange. (for example coinbase.com)
2. Newly purchased bitcoin is transferred to your coinbase "wallet". Depending on how you purchased your Bitcoin, this could be instant or take as long as 9 days. (The delay is on the bank side)
3. Once you have your BTC in your coinbase wallet, It is best practice to move your BTC to a hardware wallet or dedicated online wallet that lets you control your private keys. For example a blockchain.info wallet or a Ledger Nano S/Trezor hardware wallet. This is not because a company like coinbase is untrustworthy and will steal your coins, but because they are in danger of being stolen/seized/h4ck3d by some 3rd party or goverment and there would be nothing anyone could do for you.

Selling bitcoins on localbitcoins is NOT trading bitcoin lol. Open an account on an actual bitcoin exhcange if you want to trade bitcoin. You may want to lawyer up because you cant just operate your own exchange using some shady 3rd party like local bitcoins and not expect trouble. To be honest you are very lucky the bank stopped you before the feds bust down your door in the middle of the night.

I have both wallets as well and prefer the Trezor.
I bought the Ledger Nano S first and liked it, but ran into some small issues along the way sending various coins during peak hours. I'm not sure if its just the nodes Ledger connects to or what, but I've had frequent problems during times when I need to send coins the most.
The Trezor UI is significantly better imo. I can manage the different wallets for different coins all from 1 app. The PIN system they use is superior as well. 
I will probably end up keeping BTC and ETH on my Trezor and then keep any future shitcoins on the Ledger Nano since they currently have support for more coins.

Go to your bank and close your account, bring this letter with you and show it to one of the managers who will try to talk you out of closing your account.
Make them feel stupid for telling you what you can spend your money on.
Make sure you CLOSE your account even if they try to back off and say its OK now.

Is there anything stopping them from just packing up and stealing everyone's bitcoins? 
@_date: 2013-12-13 07:09:11
This would be completely different from committing a normal felony or bank fraud.
If they take your bitcoins what could you possibly do about it? He even says in the video that they keep most of the deposits offline. So if you woke up tomorrow and went to coinbase.com and nothing was there, how could you possibly do anything about it? Your bitcoins (Assuming you keep them at coinbase) are probably in some safety deposit box in Switzerland and you have no way to get them.
Who are you gonna call, the police? The FBI (They would probably laugh then hang up)
