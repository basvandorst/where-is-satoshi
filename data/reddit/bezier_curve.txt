It is not where you can not buy Bitcoin with PayPal.

You can just "Buy the dip".
Or you actually analyze the market and make better educated buys/sells instead of just "Buying the dip!".

That day may never come, or it may. And even if it does, that doesn't necessarily mean it will go up in price. Correlation does not always imply causation.
Considering its huge fees, it's not meant as a currency. It's really a store of value analogous to gold, but with huge fees.
If you're in it to make money, hodling will most likely not get you there.

Lol, no, it actually doesn't always work. It's been pretty bad advice if you've been hodling since last year.
If Bitcoin was to go to $100,000, I guarantee you most of this sub will say to keep on Hodling. If it goes to $200,000, they will keep on saying to Hodl. When/if it crashes to $100,000, they will still say to Hodl. You get my point. When do you actually sell and make a profit?
Hodling just teaches you to be greedy and to never be content with what you currently have.

No, but it is better to buy something with it while it's still worth something than to risk losing it in the future.
@_date: 2018-06-29 16:45:06
If you **HODL** when it's low, when it's normal, when it's high, after 2 years, after 5 years, when it crashed, when it goes up 10,000%, when it goes into a bear market, bull market, when you think that a crash is an indicator to keep on hodling, when other people tell you that this is a crash but instead you keep buying more, when your portfolio is down 75% since months ago, when you buy the dip etc. - I have one question, when exactly do you actually ever sell your Bitcoin?
Exactly why hodl is bullshit.

That doesn't stop people from believing it has value, because it does. And you can actually use it to buy things, unlike Bitcoin.

It might be schadenfreude.
Dopamine is released because it's exciting knowing it's not affecting you, similar to a roller coaster or natural disaster in another country.

Bitcoin and all cryptocurrency is basically fiat, they have value only because people think they have value. Only difference is that you can actually use USD to buy things.

Joe will not buy a $3 coffee with a $20 fee.

These are reasons, in order.
Bitcoin has been falling for the past 11 months.
The loss has been causing panic.
People are selling their Bitcoin.
People are also losing interest in Bitcoin i.e. Tulip Mania.
These have caused the price of Bitcoin to crash.
All other cryptos have fallen.
This has left a sour taste in everyone's mouth.
This is another one of those crashes. It's a bit more concerning this time because it broke support.

In Australia, due to being upside down, Bitcoin has actually went up.

It's possible, but it's incredibly unpopular and inefficient to buy with Bitcoin. If I had the choice, I'd always use USD.

Bitcoin died in popularity back in January (check google trends), it's obviously been on a decline since then. Same thing happened with fidget spinners, it never became as popular as it once was. What is happening now is simply what's been happening all year, just more dramatic.
@_date: 2018-11-15 02:20:09
Yes Bitcoin is falling you dumb fuck look at the current price.
@_date: 2018-11-15 02:09:28
I wouldn't buy a coin that's going down.
@_date: 2018-11-24 22:34:26
Same as the 5k support it has.

These are questions that none of us can answer in this life.

Nothing's guaranteed. It's not 100% certain that it'll go up 100 times as this "company" claims. Because of this, I can't give you a clear answer since I don't know for sure.
With that said, as a rule of thumb, if you just randomly invest your money into any coin you see online, you're almost always guaranteed to lose; and at best, you'll come out even.
@_date: 2018-07-04 04:42:02
This is the coin to invest in. Investing *merely* $1000 can almost guarantee you to end up making $100,000, half a Lamborghini.
You're all holding onto dying traditions, when there's clearly a way better coin to invest in. A coin that actually admits it's going to go up is a really good choice, unlike controversial coins like Bitcoin.
