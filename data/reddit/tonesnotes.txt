Congrats.... then your an idiot!
@_date: 2016-08-12 15:04:44
Your "logic"?
@_date: 2016-08-14 13:03:05
The community spends years now agonizing about a size issue and a factor of 20 doesn't matter?
The design of bitcoin oozes concern about size throughout, but 20x doesn't matter?
At its heart, bitcoin hopes to be long term, massively replicated, perfect distributed storage, but the size of what gets stored doesn't matter?
Fees may be ridiculously inflated currently, but size will always matter.
If you can't see that...then yes: You are an idiot.
@_date: 2016-08-12 15:03:16
 You're like some loud mouth getting on reddit 2 days ago and mouthing off loudly with zero understanding....
@_date: 2016-04-14 15:45:00
Fair enough. In full diplomacy mode I should have said: Are you in support of a small incremental block size increase?
Of course you could have refuted my conclusion instead of objecting to the act of leaping to one :-)
And doesn't your last sentence make you equally guilty of leaping to conclusions?
@_date: 2016-04-14 03:02:19
Hmmm.... Those points are actually very weak. Essentially "everything affects everything". Which is funny, because not increasing the block size and letting blocks fill up also affects everything.
It would be fair and reasonable to say "let's make a small incremental increase in the block size to learn what the effect would be on each of those before making a big one." Then we might have more facts to consider.
But you aren't advocating that are you? You're willing to make some changes (that also affect each of your effects :-), but not block size. No matter how small and incremental a change.

Today's tech in general.
Network bandwidth, storage space, CPU power. All are available at prices that make keeping thousands of copies of even a rapidly growing blockchain viable today.
Sure China may have poor bandwidth today. But they have cheap electricity. Other areas have great bandwidth and expensive electricity. Miners will relocate parts of their operation to optimize their returns. We don't have to help them with protocol bias.
Sure as the blockchain grows the average user, average hobbyist won't want to allocate the resources to keeping their own full copy. But there's no reason for your town library not to run a full node. And if you hold a substantial amount or transact a substantial amount then the cost of running a node is easily justified.

It's has only taken core a couple of years to come up with a scaling plan that isn't a scaling plan - but is far more complicated, affecting far more pieces of the ecosystem - than the proposals they reject so strongly they ban their discussion.
It isn't a war. It's more of a "how do you teach the kids to act responsibly without having them steam off in a huff."
@_date: 2015-06-24 04:13:22
Scalability and security are two areas in which I have always expected bitcoin to continue to evolve. Progress in these areas does not change the idea or identify of bitcoin anymore than going through puberty changes the identity of our children.
Satoshi made it clear in his earliest writing about bitcoin that the idea of bitcoin was intended to scale as far as our ingenuity and the technology of the day could take it. The attempt to redefine it as a limited settlement system is something that came later.
Every dollar I've traded for bitcoin has been a vote for the usefulness of Satoshi's bitcoin idea. Not one trade was motivated in the smallest measure by the promise of a 1 MB block size.
I think the author needs to take a step back to reconsider exactly what bitcoin is.
@_date: 2015-12-12 16:10:58
There's a LOT of room between "every" and "large important".
Even with today's tech, there's no reason most transactions couldn't end up on the blockchain.
Ordinary people need bitcoin to avoid currency manipulation by their governments. Ordinary people need bitcoin to participate in international commerce. Ordinary people need their transactions on the blockchain.
And when it comes to money, removing third parties is just good hygiene.
@_date: 2015-06-06 11:05:08
But the guardians don't just sell bitcoin, they also keep it from declining significantly from their target price by buying when necessary.
The trigger they're looking for before allowing a price rise is a sustained period of not having to buy.
If we sort out the block size BS (2xLast144min1 please), my guess is a price doubling will be allowed in the run-up to the next block reward halving.
@_date: 2014-10-09 08:16:04

Let's take it slowly then...
The premise of this post is that as long as mined Bitcoin are steadily purchased AT THE MARKET PRICE, price volatility due to mining is removed from the equation.
On the day after the block reward halves, the net rate of seller-initiated volume decreases by 1800 per day.
Assuming buyers continue to buy at the same rate (my premise), price appreciation is the mathematically expected outcome.
I'm not putting a number on "solid" and I'm certainly not considering all the other causes of price volatility...

Do you understand the fate of pessimists with gambling habits? Guess not...
@_date: 2014-10-09 08:39:40
Close. That's the point of this post. Miners have worked themselves into a corner, as they were certain to do, to the point that they now need to sell most of what they mine.
This post only applies to those with a long term interest in the success of Bitcoin. It's a reminder that until we get past the initial bulk distribution of Bitcoin through mining, we (optimists) have a vested interest in finding buyers for the mined coins.

So missing the point of trading.
People have different needs and valuations.
In voluntary trading, at the time of the trade, both parties believe they've improved their position. 
@_date: 2014-10-03 17:04:47
No. Because sometime early in 2016 the 3600 per day turns in to 1800 per day. At which point the buying momentum leads to solid appreciation.

Yup. Also FUD. There's nothing the average bitcoin user or business can do about the block size problem. Standing up new nodes is trivial by comparison. As soon as there's evidence of inadequate node coverage a great many independent actors can do something about it.
@_date: 2016-01-06 03:16:31
The cost of running a node (even at the large end of the block size debate) is peanuts compared to the profits long term holders are expecting (10x, 100x more :-)
Keeping a lid on transaction rates is a far greater concern to the long term value of bitcoin than increasing node operating costs.
@_date: 2014-03-13 04:27:33
Think (and research) it through...
The block reward drops, then vanishes over time.
The transactions per day rate increases over time. 
So your $40 number is heading to zero and will be replaced by a pure transaction fees number. Miners should know this and should be planning for it.
Secondly, the $40 per transaction isn't a transaction fee, it's the way Bitcoin solved the hard problem of motivating initial adoption. 
@_date: 2016-01-14 03:01:15
Nope. You're entitled to your opinion just as the rest of us are.
You are completely justified leveraging the value of your coins and your investment in the bitcoin network (nodes, GH/s).
But no one is justified in closing down the ability of other members of the community, with their own stakes in it, from presenting and defending their own opinions.

Your fear of hard forks is an opinion not based on hard facts.
Just as almost any change can be implemented as either HF or SF, so almost any kind of disruption can result from the wrong kind of bug in either one. 
Its actually code complexity and fear that make any change more or less dangerous.

Posted at $420, heading down to $360
Next prediction: With the switch over to Classic, along with Core's panic adoption of a similar change, the price will recover.
If Core's release beats the adoption of Classic we'll get a modest bubble.
If Classic gets to 75% first, a new eco-system will exist where Core's ideas will face true competition and censorship won't help them.
@_date: 2016-01-07 04:32:39
Fees exist today at a level to keep the idle, bored, and annoying off the bus. That's were they should stay until adoption really does start to outstrip technology. Which might be never.
I have no doubt we could make 8MB work today if adoption were to take off to that degree, but I expect the average block size - even if unhindered - will stay well bellow that for some time.
Raising the hard limit from 8MB at the historical technology growth rate strikes me as the best balance between sending the market a message of what capacity to expect over time, not needing to revisit the issue for as long as possible, and not having the limit drive unintended consequences (e.g. forcing reduced adoption by being to low when its intended to just be an anti-spam measure).
@_date: 2016-01-18 06:43:28
So claiming this is a legitimate objection is a delaying tactic for anyone smart enough to think this through for themselves.
@_date: 2016-01-29 02:13:49
Apples and oranges. Datacenter hardware/connectivity isn't required for a 2x, 4x, or even 8x average block size increase. 
Gavin's imagining what rapid broad adoption might look like, way beyond the increases now being discussed.
Raw block size increase is required to support more singleton transactions. The kind I make every week. Lightning and payment channels don't help there at all.
Bigger average blocks and broader adoption will affect who runs a node and why. There are many steps along the road to the datacenter and not all datacenter deployments are evil. Small businesses, town governments, condo associations, extended families all may discover a benefit to running Bitcoin related software in a datacenter. Decentralization and a choice of where to point your SPV+ wallet can be protected far beyond today's node operators.
@_date: 2016-03-11 14:15:46
Slush pool is voting 4 to 1 in favor of 2MB.
Big blocks are in the future. Even SegWit makes blocks bigger.
Either core will accept that blocks should have room for all transactions willing to pay traditional fees or classic will carry the day.

Hopefully some of that anger will be channeled into understanding why they're losing money.
In part, the price of bitcoin depends on how much is held by people who are sick and tired of censorship here, false "scaling" overtures from Core, and a general effort to derail what they believe bitcoin should become. It is their prerogative to sell whenever it suits them.
Hopefully some of the angry people will go so far as to decide whether it isn't also in their best interest to take a stand.
BTW: Bitcoin Classic has support from over half the mining community for an immediate 2MB increase. If Classic happens, once the dust settles, the price will likely bubble up once more.
@_date: 2016-01-30 02:18:02
I was going for a rough number and aiming on the low side since its a risk assessment.
At that quantity, I'm assuming there are discounts available as long as you aren't in a rush with your evil-hashrate-manipulation-plan. :-) And since you're most likely wasting money anyhow, you might choose to buy slightly obsolete miners and run them at a loss.

Not necessary. There are plenty of us who aren't as short sighted and see value in running our nodes even if the cost rises significantly.
@_date: 2016-01-06 07:01:16
It can actually be better for the value of bitcoin if transaction fees are paid in fiat. Trading fiat for bitcoin is what inflates the capitalization of bitcoin. The trade effectively combines buying some bitcoin from the miner and then using it to pay them a transaction fee. The only thing that matters is whether the fiat amount is above or bellow the current transaction fee value. 
Buying bitcoin increases capitalization (drives up prices).
@_date: 2016-03-01 05:04:52
That may all be true, though cloud nodes can be full nodes.
Still don't see how people spending their own money this way becomes abuse that needs denouncing.

Assuming "with" and "whose"; and thanks for making my point for me with your brilliant: "premise of a contentious power grab is fundamentally flawed".
@_date: 2016-03-15 22:49:58
That statement reflects both a lack of imagination and cold cynicism.
While I don't expect to break even as an individual, US based miner using residential electricity, if btc went to $800 I would easily.
That I could have made more on my investment in that case simply by buying BTC instead ignores the clear benefit to BTC of encouraging greater mining decentralization.
Encouraging BTC is done in many ways: holding, developing, mining, running a node, lobbying for its future direction.
Being a wet blanket "realist" serves what purpose exactly? 
@_date: 2016-03-01 03:06:09
Not problems. The cost could only go that high as long as there remains enough decentralization to keep most users confident.
@_date: 2016-01-16 17:57:47

Or will it be remembered that the sell-off triggered by Mike's blog post finally tipped the scale and induced miners to adopt bitcoin Classic. Which broke the stalemate over the block size limit and caused Core to face reality that the sky didn't fall as a result.
@_date: 2016-01-28 23:09:57
Sarcasm right? I mean he starts with a false, biased, polarizing description of the alternatives.
Apparently, according to Greg, any increase in the limit condemns us to an evil datacenter controlled future.
Gavin's scaling proposals have always been based on expected increases in capacity / decreases in cost over time of the necessary resources. As such they were neutral on the distribution of node operators.
@_date: 2016-03-02 19:31:42


problem with such a change, please speak up sooner rather than later. Other 
ideas or concerns are of course welcome as well.
Changing the difficulty adjustment algorithm should be highly controversial.
Other ideas? Sure, raise the block size limit and this becomes a non-issue.
@_date: 2016-01-18 06:34:33
In each of these cases as OperativeProvocateur pointed out, there's no fundamental reason each of these can't be broken up into multiple transactions. Certainly the code they currently use must be aware of the 1MB limit. We know this doesn't happen often currently, even without looking at the blockchain, because no business could count on these enormous transactions confirming predictably.
And to really crush this argument, if the per-transaction limit was set to 1MB while raising the block limit to 2MB, there would be zero exposure to increased validation times while continuing to support every transaction currently allowed.
@_date: 2017-03-17 17:01:08
Far too reasonable.
@_date: 2016-03-01 03:55:14
True. But there's a very wide range of possibilities between today and that scenario.
@_date: 2016-01-18 06:42:11
Except that the solution to not increasing the maximum validation time exposure while increasing the block size is trivial: Impose a 1MB transaction size limit while raising the block size limit.

That was my first comment. The solution to avoiding the non-linear transaction validation concern is trivial: Don't scale them.

@_date: 2016-01-29 21:10:44
It's not the cost of flipping the bits. It's the size of the investment they need to leverage.
A miner doesn't change their mind on a $50M investment on a whim.
A miner "fake-signalling" is risking his investment (the value of bitcoin). Where's the incentive? I think A's protocol choice is better for the value of bitcoin so I'm going to implement fork B's protocol up until B activates, then switch to A's protocol? Who do I think I'm helping/hurting?

@_date: 2016-01-04 13:17:55
Exactly. "Security" means safest store of value. Messing with the reward schedule is an obvious attack on value. Today I own Bitcoins. Regardless of what protocol changes come along, tomorrow I will choose to transact them on the most secure chain....and I'll still own Bitcoin.
You can take your xt-is-an-alt-coin and shovel it :-)
@_date: 2017-03-09 20:26:22
This is standard nonsense.
Bitcoin IS defined by proof-of-work via hash power. If you want a vote on the direction of bitcoin, you must be a miner. Yes, that does mean America's war on energy competitiveness puts us at a disadvantage, but pretending that the "economic majority" (however you're going to define that) has direct power over the bitcoin blockchain is self-deluding. Non-miners have indirect influence only. Primarily through their choice to buy, sell, or hold bitcoin.
If you choose to hold coins on a low hash power chain, you're likely to wake up to find the chain has been abandoned or attacked and your coins are worthless or gone. Good luck with that strategy.
@_date: 2017-03-14 06:05:38
The math isn't hard. I'm sure the miners can do it.
Somewhere between now and really small block rewards, large blocks full(ish) of low fee transactions will take over as the primary source of miner income.
And incase you want to go there...bitcoin price appreciation will continue to make declining block rewards ever more valuable in fiat terms for the foreseable future. 
Miners have no need to mess with the reward schedule and they're definetely smart enough to realize its not in their economic interest to do so.
@_date: 2016-03-03 03:19:50
The halving does not instantly cut revenue in half, at most it cuts the revenue rate in half. It also is more likely to lead to a price increase than decrease as the mining services bitcoin holders were paying for suddenly become half as expensive. They may be happy to let the price rise (by selling less of their coins) until mining again costs what it did before the halving (in fiat terms).
This article's risk scenarios are unlikely and the proposed solutions (hard forks and basic protocol changes) risk a far greater loss in confidence and therefore drop in price.
@_date: 2016-01-15 01:45:34
Your discounting the fact that bitcoin currently (ok, 6 months ago) worked great for buying coffee. Buying coffee is not a high-speed transaction thing. Retail sales is not a high-speed transaction thing.

Way too much moral relativism.
Where is the outrage and indignation from Core? They set the standard. A scaling conference where competing proposals aren't to be discussed? Please. The drive for Core's roadmap is fear, not theory. 1MB is safe but 2MB isn't? Oh but if 2MB is all you want let's do SW instead and maintain the precedent of not allowing the limit to change.

Strong disagreement. Having title and deed registries secured by the Bitcoin blockchain adds enormous legitimacy and creates an entire new ecosystem of supporters. In time miners will have no trouble putting a fair market value price on transactions as block rewards give way to transaction fees. There's zero need to rush this.
At a 6+ billion dollar capitalization Bitcoin is still very vulnerable. Calling these applications spam and telling them to piss off is self-defeating in the extreme.
@_date: 2016-01-07 04:55:02
You couldn't be more wrong.
If a transaction on the blockchain has the side effect of transferring the ownership of a million dollar real world asset, that transaction will matter a whole lot more to many more people than if it indicates a purchase of socks from Overstock.com. Collectively that caring will lead to new nodes, new awareness and more use of Bitcoin as well. If the title transfers on the blockchain it makes it more likely that the purchase price will as well: Same tool chain; easy to build in to the same application.
Spam is something of very little marginal value to anyone, including the originator. Calling a transaction that others find valuable "spam" just because you don't find it valuable seems more like bigotry than anything else.
And also, no, the value of bitcoin is the sum of those who prefer to hold it PLUS the bitcoin that ends up being held transiently by people executing transactions - All the classic velocity-of-money stuff from economics.
And back to your MySQL drift: There will only be one most secure, most decentralized blockchain. One big shared resource. And like air quality, the more people that care about it, the better it gets.

I'm really looking forward to when all good ideas can be debated and merged on their merits. And miners are left to decide which path leads to the highest long term income stream....Because that's what pays for the security they provide.
Right now, I'm more than happy to focus on a clear statement that miners should be allowed to decide block size and minimum transaction fees.

Exactly. Let the solution to poor validation performance of 1MB transactions be championed by the entire community.
@_date: 2016-01-06 13:05:03
Whether its a "buy" or "sell" depends on the exchange rate. Because the miner has the option of consuming regular transactions its most likely a buy: The miner gets slightly more for given the current market price. 
The main factor driving the likelihood of this kind of arrangement is limited block size and uncertainty about the fee required for rapid confirmation. This also suggests a "buy" effect since the miner is reducing risk and selling information: The fee required to get in the next block.

@_date: 2016-01-29 18:40:18
The point of increasing the block size limit is to uphold the original design of bitcoin that it was not intended to have an artificial transaction volume limit.
Real limits are engineering problems we can work on and are not what this is about.
All of your "safer / simpler" points are very unconvincing at 1MB -&gt; 2MB.
SegWit potentially will make the on-disk block size 3-4MB and you're in favor of it. By implication, you perceived Bitcoin block size could safely bump up by 4x. You're allocating that increase 100% to SegWit structured transactions. What concerns us is your apparent intent to micromanage block size growth.
Explicitly enforcing artificial limits is political BS that frustrates many of us deeply.
@_date: 2016-01-14 03:12:47
Yup it's a tool. And if it's really a useful tool and more people use it, the value is enhanced. (And I'm betting the exchange rate will rise.)

Thanks for the unhelpful analogy highlighting how you missed my point.
Say the miners get to BU 75%, and start signalling that 75% or more of them would accept a &gt; 1MB block.
And then the first &gt;1MB actually gets mined. Followed by another, and another and another.....
If you choose to keep using a wallet that considers these invalid, you'll be ignoring all these blocks. And as far as your wallet is concerned, you won't be able to send or receive bitcoin as the transactions will all be added to blocks you're ignoring.
It seems clear that the validity that matters is what the most-proof-of-work chain miners agree to. Your choice to believe their rules are invalid only hurts yourself.
Assuming there will be minority chain miners out there pouring money into a competing chain is just not doing the math.
@_date: 2017-03-09 23:58:54

That you don't see the validity of the statement "bitcoin was not intended to have a block size limit restricting the ability of legitimate transactions being included in the blockchain" is very troubling.
To me, and by observation many others, that is one of the key properties of bitcion which we would hold untouchable and uncorruptable.

Look at you with your very own FUD hose.
10% of global hash power costs roughly $20M to acquire.
Subverting a 25% hashing majority is a $50M proposition.
That's not a new risk: Anyone with $50M to waste can already make Bitcoin lie down and roll over.

Shall I use small words?
If billions of dollars of assets are owned and traded according to transactions registered on the Bitcoin blockchain the capitalization of bitcoin doesn't go up directly but many economically active people who previously didn't care about bitcoin start giving a damn. That's legitimacy.
What's the difference in a few hundred bytes on the blockchain recording the purchase of a plane ticket vs the transfer of a car, house, or stock?
If one is useful to society, so is the other. Possibly a great deal more so.
Ultimately the value of each Bitcoin is tied to how useful the Bitcoin blockchain is to all of us.

The odds of you controlling a significant chunk of hash power is very low - Given the stupidity of this plan.
You'd lose far more money switching away from the BU fork than you'd make from Roger's generosity. So would anyone else following this plan.
The odds of a significant number of miners thinking this is a prudent way to optimize their return on investment is close to zero.
@_date: 2016-01-18 13:25:01
That was interesting work but just adds mud to the debate at this point.
There is virtually zero demand for larger individual transactions. So while switching from concern over block/transaction size to concern over block validation cost is theoretically interesting: I don't see it as the issue on the table today.
Recent history has made clear that any change that isn't extremely easy to justify will be used to bog down the process in endless debate.

As a long term holder and non-moron (want to compare bank accounts?) I can state for a fact that we are expecting those returns.
The justification isn't even hard. In pace with every halving the reduced reward drain can easily drive a 2x. Increased adoption over the same interval can also easily deliver another 2x. That's 4-6 years for 10x and a little longer for 100x.
And as a long term holder I do operate multiple nodes continuously as an investment in my investment, and I mine a bit for the same reason: Decentralization. If you can, you should.
@_date: 2017-03-14 06:41:24
Let's see... From the Bitcoin kindegarden primer: Bitcoin works as long as a majority of miners act in their own economic best interest.

@_date: 2016-01-06 03:09:55
Increasing transaction count/adoption leading to larger blocks does increase the cost of running a node, but time (technology improvements) reduces the cost and adoption increases the number of entities that consider running a node.
The net effect of these influences is unknown. "Suffering...due to the actions of miners and transaction-makers" seems like a crazy way to bias the role of node operator.
There may be no net decrease in nodes if blocks go up to 8MB. It is possible there will even be an increase.
Spinning hypothetical scenarios out as "real problems" leading to "totally insecure" Bitcoin while ignoring the real economic incentives holders and businesses have in maintaining adequate node counts is just scurrilous.
Instead of FUD, just reminding the community of their importance is most likely all the node count "problem" requires.
@_date: 2016-01-14 02:34:19
But it isn't a populist majority that steers bitcoin. Its a majority weighted by investment. Ultimately you may confuse the options available to those making the actual investment, but you cannot prevent them from abandoning core if they feel the value of bitcoin would be enhanced by doing so.
@_date: 2016-03-03 07:15:12
Let's see, what are the consequences of letting the price rise? Oh yeah, miners expect to get paid more for the bitcoin they earn. Which means new fiat needs to flow into bitcoin at a higher rate, continuously, to support the higher price. Where does that come from?
Mining rewards, next to general confidence, are the biggest brake on rising bitcoin prices.
The ideas in this article are weak in that the author is likely wrong about the dynamics of the original problems and also about the risk/benefits of his proposed solutions: Which include a HF.
Treating all HFs as equally dangerous is silly. Its unfortunate that the community is being encouraged to fear them on principle. If the author has taken a stab at actually quantifying the risks of a HF that might be interesting. I'm a bit tired of the "HF's are dangerous" line however. 
@_date: 2016-01-06 13:14:48
From a node operator's point of view, all transactions are equally irrelevant bits of data. Only a tiny fraction will ever relate to the transactions they care about directly. 
If equity transactions make it into the chain, every broker, car dealer, real estate agent, stock trader may choose to start running a node. Again the net effect will be strongly positive. 
@_date: 2016-01-30 02:30:07
So in your scenario 25% of global hash power might be thinking "Classic is a bad idea, but we'll help activate it to help destroy it. And right after it activates, we'll switch back to core because waiting for it to fail is too risky."
Except that switching back at that point guarantees a protracted resolution. Guaranteeing a plunge in the value of bitcoin and likely classification as pariahs in the mining world.
Truly, your mastery of adversarial thinking is dizzying.
@_date: 2016-01-29 16:41:57
The point is then valid that you are in support of RBF (opt-in). The FAQ does not discuss double ended opt-in: The recipient should have a say prior to the broadcast of the transaction.
It is also disingenuous to claim (as the faq does) there was no objection (to opt-in) when the decision was reached during a time of aggressive censorship of competing initiatives in the bitcoin space.
@_date: 2017-03-09 17:35:11
It's tragic this even get's up votes.
The logic is so fundamentally bad.
Miners will care about the value of what they mine, not just how many coins.
The value of the coins on a chain with responsive capacity, predictable confirmation times, and fees driven by real technology limits and competition is going to be much higher.
Therefore the value of the block rewards alone is likely to be worth much more, even if the fee income drops back to something small.

That's the math part.
Far and away the most likely outcome is that miners do NOT continue to mine using the 1MB only rules. The economics for them to do so are very different than for ETH.
Unlike the ETH fork, where the minority chain was essentially equivalent in transaction capability almost immediately, the 1MB chain would have very slow block times for months - even if no miners changed their minds - even if it wasn't attacked in some way to help kill it off. Miners would be forgoing coins very likely to be worth close to current prices on the main chain for coins that could be worth zero if the minority chain dies and would likely be worth much less immediately after the fork. And then there's the possibility that the market would react to an end to the deadlock in favor of increased capacity with a sharp price run up on the main chain.
The ETH fork was motivated by damage control that had to be done in a way that fundamentally challenged fungibility. There was a practical argument in support of one fork (new) and a philosophical argument in support of the other (old). The BTC fork is about an arbitrary number that was never meant to be a limit to "real" transactions and the almost religious crusade being fought to justify not making a simple change to return bitcoin to its normal mode of operation.
Remember you're postulating a future where 75+% of the miners have decided that at least part of what they've been told for years now is not in their best interest. There's also a very large community (very under-represented on this sub due to its "rules") that feels betrayed. Just as we discovered last November - when the debate of ideas is attacked by controlling the communications channels - it becomes very hard to predict people's real hopes and loyalties.
The change wallet and exchange developers need to make to be compatible with larger blocks is simple and well documented (at least for the block sizes we're likely to see anytime soon).

But that's not what's happening.
You're using your privileged position as part of a centralized engineering resource to drive RBF into the protocol (which benefits your Layer2 solution) and to resist/delay a block size limit increase (which also benefits your Layer2 solution). Both of those actions hurt bitcoin adoption by ordinary users interested in singleton transactions with low fees and predictably short confirmation times.

Just read a bunch of your recent posts... If your research has really led you to believe that the "bus is full no matter what the ticket price" analogy is helpful, it may be time to consider your research methods.
For a good stretch of time, bitcoin's bus was generally not full and fees were a trivial part of miner compensation. (I think most bigger-blockers really just want this phase to continue up until a real technology limit is reached - Which if we're sufficiently clever with may never happen.) And if the ticket price was huge the bus would always be empty. So the analogy is generally false.
The analogy only kind of makes sense if you imagine trying to service usage levels that exceed our current technical ability. SW would allow the data per block to climb to as much as 4MB. Allowing 4MB for general on-chain transactions, not just those that happen to make optimum use of witness data, would return us to the mostly plenty of space bitcoin era without requiring any technology not already assumed to exist by SW.
So the analogy requires much higher usage than 4x today's level. Certainly there's such a level - but its far from certain when it will be reached. Today, being for SW is being for buses 4x the size of the current buses, but where 75% of the seats are reserved for purple people.
Sure it makes sense from a raw capacity point of view to be in favor of SW. But as a matter of principle, many of us feel the combined pro-SW-anti-bigger-blocks policy is just as wrong as reserving those seats for just white people - not all people.

Embedding mining is a great idea that doesn't require running a full node in each device any more than today's miners do - they contribute to a pool. Many miners for every one or two nodes.
Don't individuals run nodes because it lets them transact bitcoin? How many nodes will go dark when their owners can no longer afford the transaction fees. More likely, in that scenario, for only LN hub operators and large holders to run them.
@_date: 2016-11-24 03:21:00
:-) Yes we agree on 100 &lt; 10000.
I would rewrite your SW block size formula:
4 x bs + wd &lt; 4 MB
like this:
non-witness-data + 1/4 witness-data &lt;= 1 MB
because it reflects how the SW soft fork thinks about it to keep the hard coded 1 MB limit while counting only one of every four bytes of witness data towards that total.
Every byte of witness data is still real data occupying a full byte of storage. Any node wishing to keep a full record of every transaction will still need to store those bytes. Some types of nodes may choose to discard some or all witness data over time, but its very hard to make a strong total cost savings and technology impact argument in support of this formula.
The reality is that the network better be able to handle considerably more than 1 MB of data per block to support this version of SW.
Why not travel the much more honest road of bumping up the actual limit to 4 MB and go with the straight equivalence formula:
non-witness-data + witness-data &lt; 4 MB ???
It feels to many that Core is artificially packaging SW to give a subset of transactions (the ones LN will use) a scaling boost while doing nothing for traditional transactions.

Nonsense. The current formula delivers an economic advantage to transactions that can benefit from heavier utilization of witness data.
There has been a bunch of hand waving to justify this, but it is fundamentally picking economic winners and losers: And only possible (or necessary) while simultaneously keeping the block size cap at a level where transactions are fighting each other to fit into the next block.
The way this issue has been structured; the way the opposition viewpoints have been sensored; the way fear of a hard fork has been positioned as a cudgel to maintain control: All of these are dishonest.

What's a "128-bit security proof"? Is that a better proof than a 64-bit proof but worse than a 256-bit proof?
Bitcoin isn't fragile, but it is unforgiving by comparison to traditional financial services.
If it were in fact easy to "remove the currency" or to "change the way the(sic) currency works", then perhaps his conclusion that its easy to break might follow.

If you're talking about the halving then the solution is simple: Think of block rewards as a brake on how rapidly the price of bitcoin can rise (sustainably). With each halving, roughly, the price of bitcoin can comfortably double. Which leave's our miner friends earning roughly the same amount over time. There haven't been enough halvings yet for the pattern to emerge, but it will. Kind of a Moore's Law for Bitcoin.

What IS the maximum on disk size of all the data associated with a SegWit block then?
@_date: 2016-02-13 08:10:20
The objective is to keep bitcoin's capacity ahead of adoption - And to allow adoption to fuel increased capacity.
A 2MB limit bump + SegWit can yield 3MB to 8MB (depending on the mix of transaction types and keeping the 25% size discount of the current SegWit proposal). That feels like some comfortable running room for the next year of adoption and buys time to implement the next set of scaling ideas (of which there are many if you look around).
It's a mistake and silly to focus on getting to Visa scale in just a few years. A decade or two are much more likely and reasonable. Which brings large increases in hardware performance into play and time to get even more creative on protocol and algorithms.
Its great to be concerned about a loss of decentralization, but the link between scale and decentralization is complex. We may lose hobbyists but pick up small businesses, communities, clubs, extended families, real estate agents, stock brokers. So long as the average person has multiple local and international choices for their SPV wallets decentralization will be fine.
We also can't get to Visa scale without the capitalization of bitcoin increasing significantly. Which means the price would have to increase dramatically. Which just isn't likely for another halving or three (4 to 12+ years) while the block rewards are so substantial.

I have confidence that between engineering solutions and hardware performance improvements the effective/apparent bitcoin TPS can continue to double every year or two.
"Effective/apparent" because what matters is the perception that when an individual fires up their wallet app, they can directly send bitcoin to anyone.
It doesn't matter to most of us, most of the time, exactly what transaction(s) get created to accomplish the transfer. We don't care if sometimes transactions get aggregated or if sometimes they travel by payment channel.
This means there are many ways for ingenuity to increase the TPS limit and we've only just begun to work on it.
My only concern is that we don't try.
@_date: 2016-02-13 04:47:37
No. What actually matters is that we trust the people making changes to the protocol to preserve the essence of bitcoin.
SegWit is a great idea, but the space savings favors the kind of transactions Blockstream needs. RBF less so. The history of how we got here should also not be dismissed.

Its arrogant to be correct? Go figure.
You need to do more than talk about how you see your "both coins" scenario play out. What motivates people to keep adding blocks to the shorter chain? If blocks aren't being added (or very slowly added) how does the transaction of selling the short chain coin to your friend get confirmed and why on earth would he want to buy it? Add some detail. Understand what really would have to happen (and keep happening) for your scenario to actually happen.

Nonsense. High block rewards act as a brake on rising bitcoin value which is only maintained currently by the rate of new money/holders flowing in. As block rewards drop, bitcoin value can rise. As the value rises, transaction fee value rises.

@_date: 2015-09-02 22:52:19
Not explained there and probably not true. The orphan rate in general goes up with block size. The miner who chooses to mine a bigger than average block incurs a greater orphan risk. If that's not offset by the fee rewards then only civic mindedness will keep a miner producing big blocks.
@_date: 2015-09-10 04:22:14
Miners collect roughly 3600 new bitcoins each day, many of which get sold to cover operating costs.
Think of it as a baloon with a steady leak. It takes about the same amount of new money flowing in for the price to hold steady.
Which is why the reward halving is exciting. Come next summer the leak gets cut in half, making it much easier for the baloon to inflate.

@_date: 2015-09-02 22:37:51
Say the value of a bitcoin doubles (in fiat terms) every time the block reward halves. Then miners continue to earn at least the same amount over time through then end of block rewards except that as the value rises, at some point they start to make more from fees then from rewards. If it's 1% now, then in less than 7 halvings (28 years).
But if block size continues to grow aggressively then it may be much sooner that fees eclipse rewards while never causing miners to earn less than they do today per block.
@_date: 2015-09-03 04:11:20
Stronger and more secure maybe. But probably also smaller and much less relevant.
The mining pools, other than Slush, aren't supporting anything yet. They like BIP100 (words, not code) because it promises to give them control over what currently is a debate among all stake holders. All they have to do is drop a few characters in their block's comment string and they're "voting". They can vote until the cows come home and absolutely nothing will change - no code.
Miners aren't being asked to support XT. They're being asked to support BIP 101. For which there's actual code and work to do to switch over. Oh and the decision doesn't really matter until next year anyhow.
What a surprise that given a choice between no-work-now-and-we'll-get-control vs. work-to-do-now-and-no-extra-control they're happy to pick the former.
How is a business supposed to plan their usage model of the network when its capacity is a variable they can't predict or control? They'll be forced to plan on the lowest guaranteed capacity. Or possibly miners will start selling their votes to businesses that need extra capacity: The bitcoin capacity tax.
On the other hand, if a particular miner finds that bitcoin has grown too fast or too large for them to keep up with; wouldn't you rather have them step out and let new miners with better resources step in? If in fact no miners can handle all the transactions and fill the blocks then they'll go unfilled for a good reason until the technology catches up and fees will indeed rise.

Decentralized is not a binary state.
Yup bitcoin dies if mining can be captured by any one interest.
My point, and perhaps the OPs, is that decentralization is enhanced by having more people invested in defending it. The more people who hold significant value in bitcoin the more independent miners their are likely to be. Mining pool concentration in China is likely to be a phase in the evolution of bitcoin.
If you really want to encourage decentralization (of mining, nodes, control over key software implementations) then encourage adoption first and foremost.
@_date: 2015-09-09 01:43:33
The soft cap is a tactical choice. Raising it above 750kb won't make much difference until overall transaction rates climb some more.
Agreeing on a sequence of future increases in the hard limit is a strategic imperative with leverage over the direction of bitcoin in the years ahead.
So no, not the first step. Not really relevant at all.
@_date: 2015-09-09 04:12:22
Isn't it ironic that the DDoS attack against Slush, allegedly by those in favor of a proposal based on miners voting (BIP100), are in fact proving the point that reliable decentralized voting is hard. Which is exactly why their opponents may favor a proposal that doesn't require voting (BIP101).
@_date: 2015-09-03 16:28:42
How is this not a completely ordinary scaling problem? People try to cut corners. It bites them. They learn and move on.
I don't think you're saying it becomes impossible to do right at a certain block size. It seems like you're just generally worried that these types of issues are driven by increasing the block size.
I'd agree with you on that. But why lose confidence that the issues can be resolved? Why assume that just because there may be some advantage to centralizing there aren't a long list of competing benefits/restrictions/preferences to not centralizing?
@_date: 2015-09-08 02:07:58
Are you measuring anything except the personal preferences of the pool operators? Where does your graph represent the votes of the users and holders of bitcoin? Or the companies building products in the space?
How is your graph not attempting to manipulate the issue by painting a very incomplete picture of all the stakeholders?

@_date: 2015-09-02 23:34:29
Again. Piffle. First a miner takes a risk making a large block. If his gamble pays off, he's got a slight edge over other miners who have to download it. That's part of the reward for his original risk. Its a fair gamble.
The original cap had nothing to do with preventing large miners from pushing out smaller ones. It was a knee jerk anti spam measure never intended to have longevity.
Blocks don't become huge any time soon. The hardware required to compete with bigger blocks is unlikely to get more expensive than it is today.
Decentralization fears are like global warming - Prove your fear is well founded before demanding the world make sacrifices for you.

And before someone asks: Yes there are good reasons to believe that the value should at least double in the time it takes for the reward to halve over the long haul.
@_date: 2015-04-01 11:54:39
The transaction cost isn't $7 per transaction, it's between 2.5 cents and zero for most transactions.
The mining burden (3600 new bitcoin per day) is not a transaction cost. Much more equivalent to a long drawn out initial stock offering.
The price holding steady at the current $240-$260 range indicates that demand (net new money wishing to flow into bitcoin) is roughly equal to the net outflow (including the mining burden).
Thus its much more likely that the halving will lead to a price increase than a decrease.
Miners aren't being overcompensated. Their doing a fabulous job of following their self-interest while simultaneously securing our transactions and fairly seeding the remaining new bitcoin into circulation.
@_date: 2015-09-03 00:23:19
"The power to make such future-defining decisions must belong to the community" -
Except that BIP100 doesn't give the power to the community - just to the miners.
"non-negative dissatisfaction function" -
Wish I had one of those. But not a convincing solution to all the ways the voting could be gamed.
Bitcoin will be much more reliable if regular voting by human agents doesn't determine the capacity of the network.
Miners already have plenty of power: Don't like big blocks? Don't mine them. Don't think transaction fees are high enough? Pick which transactions you include in your blocks.

Miners failing to validate their own work have little long term value to the network.
This has already happened with the current tiny block size and lessons were learned.
You implied that larger blocks will encourage bad (unvalidated) mining. While it clearly magnifies the incentive, a miner really can't survive without a reliable and integrated source of validation data.
Say the block size goes up and the blocks start getting filled in the short term (not likely). Then miners with connectivity issues will either get them fixed or look for reliable, high connectivity validators to partner with because they learned their lesson.
They will be force to move the coordination / validation function to better connectivity while leaving the hashing power where the power, space, and labor is cheap.
This is not a bad thing for the network. The alternative is letting the network run into an avoidable capacity limit which is a bad thing.
@_date: 2015-09-02 23:23:16
Block size is not like difficulty. The scenarios in which the block size needs to be reduced are so contrived that it is far more likely to be a new attack vector than to solve an actual problem.
Specifically, I consider those who would like to see bitcoin become a settlement network for high fee transactions an attack vector on the original concept of bitcoin and what it should become.
@_date: 2015-09-03 02:48:31
Nothing about this concern has anything to do with block size.
Miners failing to fully validate the chain they're trying to add blocks to will learn sooner or later that it doesn't pay. I'd be surprised if it happens again. Miners (Chinese or not) should try cutting every corner they think they can. We wan't them to be as efficient as they can be.
If they cut too many corners and mine what turn out to be invalid blocks, then they'll either learn or go out of business.
@_date: 2015-09-02 22:23:41
Oh lighten up with the "reckless" and "should have no place".
It's a cap. Miners are free to make smaller blocks. It's likely to keep pace with hardware capabilities and costs. And if, in a few years greater wisdom is achieved, then a far less contentious process than this one can amend the formula.
I have very little interest in a bitcoin with a transaction cap that isn't growing aggressively. Zero interest in bitcoin that can't reliably be used daily by ordinary people.
Yes there are scaling problems still to be tackled other than the block size (propagation, node storage &amp; memory optimization, etc.)
Let's make a decision and move on to those challenges.
@_date: 2015-09-08 14:28:18
Being in favor of BIP101 does not mean you have to fill all your blocks to the limit.

Imagine a bit harder and you can come up with many reasons for reality to be more complicated than that.

So now that it's clear Gavin wasn't hacked (he's at a conference and personally confirmed the contents of this blog post on live video);
and that Craig has in fact signed messages with the keys from the earliest blocks in front of expert witnesses;
the only ground the deniers have left is that he hasn't duplicated the signing for each of them individually.
If a signed message were posted online, it would only prove that someone wanted to support the appearance of Craig being Satoshi. Not that he was actually in possession of those keys.
The keys by themselves also don't prove he's Satoshi (Satoshi could could have given them to him).
Ultimately we all have to really look at the evidence and make up our own minds.

Pretend for a minute that he is Satoshi.
And that he doesn't give a damn about being famous or really proving it to anyone except for just enough to get the media and tax men off his employees, friends and family.
Maybe he just doesn't want to publish the proof you'd like to see.
If he did publish it. Wouldn't you just move on to asking him to prove that the real Satoshi didn't somehow just give him the keys to a block or two. Wouldn't the next stop be "now prove you can move all those coins".
And the funny thing would be if he played along and finally moved a million coins. You'd finally have all the proof you wanted just as you realized he'd moved them to an exchange and was dumping them because he was just sick and tired of the small minded demands and abuse.
While there's any chance at all of him actually being Satoshi, wouldn't politeness be our best strategy?
