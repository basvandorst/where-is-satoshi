Their product is vaporware and is a far larger change to BTC than some of the proposed forks circulating now.

Part of me wonders if Bl--kstr--m gave various developers and a moderator here some kind of off the record financial incentive to constantly censor people and prevent the will of the users.

I'll buy your worthless post-fork Classic altcoins™ for $10/coin.
Let's say one month after the proposed fork completes. Deal?

Well, if you believe him, then [many other mining pools also "don't understand Bitcoin"]( either.

You don't care that Core spent 1000s of hours developing what's supposed to be an awesome improvement, 1000s of hours trying to proselytize existing bitcoin users and businesses, only to see the ecosystem decline it?
Sure, whatever you say!

You're seeing things in black and white.
On a scale of 1 to 10, if Bitcoin-Segwit's centralization is a 4, this forked Bitcoin might be a 6. Too many people here assume it's at a 10. All of these hysterics about "ChinaCoin" are just that, hysterics.  Don't like the forked coin? Don't use it and/or sell it off. It literally does not affect people on the other side of the fork in any way.
Once again, the market is willing to give up some another of decentralization for increased usability, whether you personally agree with that or not. (ETH vs ETC)
Why are some people here so insecure about the other side of the fork?
@_date: 2017-07-25 05:44:18


All the anger and mocking here really comes off as insecurity &amp; anxiety that the market won't value the forked "ChinaCoin" at $0.01 like certain people think it should. You complain about centralization all the time, yet the forking off, giving people more options, is a form of decentralization. Embrace it. Sell your forked coins if you're convinced they're worthless.


Are you hinting that you think ETC could be more valuable? Because you can substitute "BTC/BCC" for "ETH/ETC" respectively and your premise is still valid. Where does that leave BCC?

I'm talking about BitcoinCash, BitConnect has nothing to do with it.

Even if Bitmain had a literal monopoly on mining hardware (they don't), *and* even if bitmain controlled every single mining pool (they don't), how does this affect actual "ChinaCoin" users in any way? Has he been preventing people from moving coins somewhere? Is he demanding exorbitant miner fees for small transactions? Has the government threatened to unilaterally shut down the entire country's mining operations? Even if they did, there are already miners in other countries anyway.
Once again, how on Earth does this affect *anyone* on the other side of the fork?? Why does anyone here care?
Your average random users have little to no interest in mining operations. All they ultimately want to do is move coins from A to B, cheaply and quickly.
Why don't we decrease block size to 100kB to decrease centralization on Bitcoin? Probably because there's a happy medium somewhere. Truthfully, neither you nor I know where that level is.

You sound like an incredibly angry person. Stop repeatedly telling everyone to "go back to ____".


Actually, they do have "the right". All open source projects can be forked. Many open source projects are eventually forked. That's the very nature of open source. Just because you don't like it doesn't mean they're forbidden to fork away. Sorry.


No one is forcing you personally to use their software. Problem solved.
Again, you've demanded that bigblock people fork away for months. Now they finally are. Yet you're apoplectic about it for some reason. Adios, and calm the hell down.

Great response, answering none of my post.
I don't think *you* get it - even if BCC were literally controlled by one guy sitting in a room with all miners and nodes owned by him, that *still* does not affect anyone continuing to transact/hold/etc on the other side of the fork. End of story.
You've wanted the others to fork away for months. You've got it. You still have your awesome developers, your coveted decentralization. Yet now this sub feels the need to criticize their half of the fork, which literally has nothing to do with your preferred half. Why?
@_date: 2017-07-25 03:43:27
Wasn't everyone here constantly encouraging the others to, and I quote, "just fork off already"?
So now they've done just that, and... what... you're mocking? Angry?
Perhaps the larger market doesn't value "decentralization" quite as much as some people here do. I give you ETH vs ETC as Exhibit A, where the centralized token is worth at least 10 times as much. Why is that?
