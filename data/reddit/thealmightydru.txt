Done. I'm not a big Bitcoin proselytizer, but fuck these assholes. I hate corporate bullies using their power to maintain their outdated business models.

To be clear, it wasn't me. I just looked up and was surprised to see it.

Which, of course, in French means, "A lot of Grayson." 
I used to listen to a lot of "It's All Politics" on NPR and that joke never got old.

Currency is a medium of exchange. That piece of paper in your wallet has no intrinsic value. It has a practical value in our society. It is only worth anything because the government says it is and by the fact that other people want it. There is nothing different at the moment in that respect between BTC and USD/GBP/EUR/etc aside from demand for them.

I kick myself every time I read threads like this. I was going to buy in when it was at $7 a while back, but I didn't go through the hassle of linking bank accounts, etc.
Now I'm waiting for my bank account to verify whilst I work the faucets. I'm not going to let risk aversion screw me over again.

Most people have a hard time understanding how disruptive any technology is. I just wonder if Bitcoin will be a significant force before a mass wave of demonetization hits society.

That is exactly the response one should expect from people who created a card game full of Holocaust and dead baby jokes. Get uppity about it if you want, but that's what that kind of response is meant to elicit.

Same here, but I think these sound more natural abbreviations than "millis" and "micros."

You know, I like Bitcoin. I'm not a big pusher for it or anything, but I think it's interesting and fun.
What kills me is when people say things like this:






...where a person is so fundamentally ignorant to the theoretical concepts of currency, money, and wealth. Something's not legitimate unless someone has control, or until someone strong enough says it's legitimate. It's like when people argue about statehood, saying a place like Somalialand is not a "real" country because the big boys don't recognize it as such, despite it fitting all the criteria for a sovereign state.
I'm by no means an ideological libertarian, but the blind obedience so many people pay to central authorities drives me batty.
And I know this is the NY Post and it's shit anyway, but there are some writers from more reputable sources (supposedly) that do the same thing.
