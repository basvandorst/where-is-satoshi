Yes surprisingly it did. However it took almost 2 weeks and was a huge hassle. If I am going to give anyone my personal credentials it is only coinbase from now on.

Can someone tell me how they will enforce US residents not trading on their platform? Does it have to do with IP addresses?

Hey guys this got resolved I am going to close the thread. Thanks for the help.

Oh okay phew. Well according to the transaction history on the exchange the missing transaction is complete. However on the block chain explorer only the first transaction is listed the missing transaction is not there.

Thanks todd for replying.
I guess what I am trying to figure out is when I place an order that is never fulfilled during any given session does that influence the candlestick? Or do completed buy/sell orders  only influence the candlestick?

Wall of Coins Requires photo id for 2000 USD buys. AND it took them 12 days to complete the transaction. I would not recommend them.

Thank you both for replying. To be more clear. The data points in the real body... do they represent executed trades between buyer and seller?
If that is true are the wicks asking and list prices that were never fulfilled?

Thank you I think this answers my question. The candlesticks are formed from all completed transactions in a given time interval. 
Thank you

So I am guessing this is not where you buy bitcoin with USD
@_date: 2017-06-15 17:07:42
Youre right I dont know what I am talking about. What exchange allows me to trade USD not USDT for bitcoin 24/7?
@_date: 2017-06-08 01:03:58
Where do you buy your coins?
@_date: 2017-06-07 12:43:36
Wow thats a damn shame. screw the government and their regulation of everything.
@_date: 2017-06-08 02:02:57

Hi Slvbtc
Thanks for responding. I guess I am trying to figure out would be how bids and asking prices play into the candlestick formation. Thousands of transactions could be involved in one 5 minute candle stick. Are these transactions completed, where currency is exchanged for stock ( or currency for currency in the cryptoworld ). Or can an uncompleted transaction still play into the way the candle forms?
Do only completed orders from the exchange during that session create the candlestick. Or do all orders completed or not play into the way the real body and the wicks form?
Thank
