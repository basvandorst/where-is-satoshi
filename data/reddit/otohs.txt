Shown on the second chart from the top here:
Check the last six months say. You can see that the total active BTC Swaps (shorts) are very high and the total active USD swaps (longs) is currently low.
A lot more shorts than longs.
But also see the first chart here:
The big difference between the two links is that the short positions (i.e BTC+LTC swaps opened / total sum of swaps in BTC and LTC ) in the  charts are represented in USD Value so you can compare the absolute value of long vs short positions. The charts on  can be a bit misleading as you are comparing charts in different scales (5k BTC vs 30 000k USD)

At least I was able to get approx half of the 200 BTC value that I had on there out so there's still hope for the rest, at the end of January I will be in the States for a few months and if there's been no further progress I will be sicking all the relevant regulators and law enforcement plus my lawyers there on them most likely.

You could buy/register a short domain of say 6 to 7 chars total like j95.net
I expect you could find cheaper, then with a vanity address generating service make an address to match it, say starting with 1j95NET...... as it's only 6 chars after the 1 it would be quick, cheap &amp; easy to do with:
Then you would have to hope that the recipient spots the likely URL &amp; visits  to see if there's a message there, you may have to send multiple times to nudge them to look but once they do you have a whole site that you can use to communicate with them or multiple recipients individually or collectively. 
You could also register the full set of 1J95.COM 1J95.NET 1J95.ORG all for about $30 &amp; make vanity addresses like 1J95com...... 1J95NET...... 1J95org...... &amp; if you sent from these 3 it's very likely the recipient would go look at whatever message you put on your sites, I expect this could be refined, I see that 1Q5.ORG is available for only $6.99 &amp; the FirstBits address of 1Q5ORG is also not taken as yet for an address starting 1Q5org...... but a .NET is probably the clearest &amp; most obvious to use as you can have it all in CAPS.

Re: "Just looking at the market depth on MTGOX right now, if just $2,000,000 were cashed in against the present bids, the price of bitcoin would crash down to $0.60. Same goes for upside BTW, it takes very little trading to move the price relative to market cap." 
Like an iceberg there is lots of hidden depth for both buys &amp; sells, unless you wanted crazy slippage it would be a waste of coins/dollars to dump them like that &amp; it would immediately bounce back a lot anyway, if instead you used $2M or of coins to move the market you would find very strong resistance levels emerging the more you did so as most of the big players remain on the side lines &amp; don't show their cards until they're ready to trump you - you just better hope that they don't have $3M or equivalent (some do) or any combination of stronger market forces that don't like the way you're pushing it.

Re question 2, there have been a bunch of alt currencies, mostly made as offshoots from the Bitcoin code with variations, most have failed miserably due to the greed of the originators, lack of benefits over Bitcoin so lack of interest which makes for a small network that is easily attacked, one though that is doing very well is Litecoin which offers faster transaction confirmations, google it for details &amp; trade it here:  Bitcoin though remains by far the main crypto currency due to it's establishment &amp; popularity, I do see LTC doing well in some niche markets in the future too though.

 I think that you'll just have to put it down to being an expensive mistake learned the hard way, the good news is that you &amp; some others will be more careful in the future &amp; maybe you'll have a lot more coins then so it will have been a lesson well worth having dealt with earlier on, always to back up passwords/private keys in 2 or more different locations, consider using LastPass pro service with Yubi key to generate &amp; store your passwords, blockchain.info wallets work well with this, make separate wallets to split your funds amongst with an extra secure offline one for the bulk.
Best hope as said is following up any leads to the pen drive, where &amp; how did you loose it - an internet place (they always have dozens left behind), a library, a bar? Post some reward notices for it all around the places that you may have lost it if you don't know exactly where.
Another way to very easily have a password or private key backup is to take a screen shot, or photo of it &amp; save that somewhere obscure - it wouldn't show up if someone was searching for passwords or dat files &amp; if you have thousands of photos like me it could be easily hidden - not best practice but something that would have helped in this case.
Do you have the public address/es where the funds are/were btw, the pen drive just had your wallet password on it not a copy of the wallet too I assume?

As you have a USD bank account then Dwolla is the cheapest way to move your $ to it once you've sold on say Mt. Gox, it can take 5 business days, but get it all set up &amp; approved first &amp; you will also need a verified Mt. Gox account to use Dwolla nowdays, Dwolla will also want you to send verification for your US residence &amp; will probably get a bit spazzy if you're using a non US IP which can take a couple of weeks to sort out assuming you say what they want to hear. Personally I use the excellent  to just exchange to USD for mid rate + 1.4% &amp; no fees, it will take 1 to 2 days to arrive in your USD account, use ACH/EFT option if possible. You can send direct to Mt. Gox in USD too for about a $15 fee - if you want more info PM me on Bitcointalk forum, ID: Otoh

Also what's the minimum entry, maybe €100k so only room for 10 clients, but the biggest if is that 'the fund would be a regulated entity &amp; so institutional investors may participate', it may not be so easy to get regulatory approval for something that can kill banks &amp; drain power from deficit loving govs but will be interesting to watch.

An excellent summary of the benefits for a seller from using bitcoins, as I understand it though only 1 block is released every 10 minutes which atm equals 50 BTC generated &amp; increased tech just means that those adapting it are more likely to solve the blocks first &amp; get those coins, but that doesn't change how many coins are released - that's fixed &amp; can only decrease when the block reward is halved to 25 coins towards the end of this year &amp; again in the future.

I'd just use blockchain.info wallet, export &amp; save an encoded backup of your addresses &amp; private keys that are on it in 2 different physical locations is best or physical &amp; cloud, unless you generate new addresses you won't need to re-back it up.

Update on yesterday's Cryptsy withdrawals, still waiting for the 6 BTC but the 200 Dash went through, so have just initiated a 755 Dash &amp; a 240 Dash W/D, if using alts is a better or the only way to get large amounts (or any BTC) out then that may prove healthy for the Dash price for a while, I still have 52 BTC &amp; 645 Dash to get out of there, but the 200 clearing does at least show that all hope isn't lost.

Many thanks for the info, I wish that they did ask me for some more KYC/AML checks, I am happy to provide anything that they require, the trouble is they do not do so, they just keep my money and ignore my attempts to find out how to resolve this.
I've just initiated a further 300 DASH W/D which is what they limit me to atm, this will take forever to get my approx 80 to 90 BTC balance out and they take 0.5% in fees each time, which I could use the one remaining free W/D to avoid if I could just do it in one transaction.

Yesterday Cryptsy processed two of my withdrawals, for 0.77805570 BTC &amp; 100 Dash  :o  there are other older ones still pending and I've no idea what they are doing, I doubt that they do either, but anyway a few more hundred dollars out is good and helps to confirm that they are trying to return funds rather than just run with everything :-\
They continue to ignore my support emails :(
@_date: 2015-11-09 23:40:44
Over 24 hrs since my last small allowed withdrawal and I still can't get any more out, so no more $2,000 per day, just steal my 70 BTC = $26,600 balance and ignore me, ban me from chat, refuse to give me your corporate details and lawyer's address, tomorrow I begin a wider denouncement of this exchange and it's illegal robbing of client funds.

@_date: 2015-11-07 15:10:48
but GL with that if it's in the tens of thou of dollars
it's not called slow, it seems like forever that i have waited for my btc WD
 will see sub 200 again, but not within the scope of the settlement dates for quarterlies this time around
 Can you please quit the FUD? When I needed BTC out when withdraws were stuck, I converted it to Doge, sent it to another exchange to convert it back to BTC and then sent it to coinbase where I sold it to fiat. 
 That would be so awesome!
 I believe he exceeded his daily limit as a tier 2, and that caused issues
For those with BTC or other withdraw issues, simply get verified. That's what solved all my problems. ALL US financial institutions are under close scrutiny 
 is impossible to initiate withdraw if you reached withdraw limit
 the guy a break already...I wouldn't want his job and I doubt you would either! 
to be honest....even banks make it hard to get your money out of them if you have large sums...so a word of advice...plan ahead...sell your coins for fiat in small sells of 500 to a 1000 ata time and have em send you a check
 fact that btc withdraw holds for days it is a fact 
Regulations are effecting all US financial institutions right now
 your right but that still doesnt effect the WD issues
 that has nothing to do with it... its utter bullpoop... honestly its tiring to see users being banned here for being tinkleed of not getting their btw or other coins out...
where'd the eMark wallet / market go? 
 
 If regulation limit ppl from being able to withdraw more than $2,000 and they want to get 10 BTC in one go, then it will effect the WD
 heh, he tried $22,000 in one go :)
 he can withdraw 76btc with doges? how many he will lose on buying higher than market price and selling lower..?
there was no announcement or notification that the eMark market was being removed..  are coins that were in balance gone?
 even if that was the problem trying to do it in one go it should take a month to fix.. see reddit posts... 
 I have, and I believe it will get fixed, still, I would expect someone playing with that much to be expedited to tier 3
you won't lose money buying doge, just hold doge till it goes back up to 150 satoshi and you profit lol
Sprouts will be back above 300 sat soon
 folks even with small amounts can't get out.. explain me that then... and why does it take a month for cryptsy to mess around with it? if its such a standard problem it should not take that long tbh... 
 is way overvalued and the market cap is unsustainable imHo!
Opportunities to get super ridiculously cheap Sprouts are dwindling as people are sending BTC here to buy more
 not arguing that their aren`t problems, just pointing out his situation is a bit more unusual
I deposited over $50,000 of coins, was fully verified with no W/D limits, now I can't get half of them out, so it's only fair to let others who are using this exchange know the risks that they are taking, no serious exchange acts in this way, I've made my comment and the publicity may help me get this resolved as nothing else seems to work, I'll leave now and only respond on Reddit/btc  thanks.

email to support, Monday 9th Nov
Hi Gretchen,
"As for your Tier 3 upgrade request,
Your request has been acknowledged by our team and your case will be reviewed shortly."
This was just a joke, right? Ten days and no one has contacted me, five weeks since I tried to withdraw my funds, also I've been perma-banned from your chat with no reason given when I wasn't even online, great way to treat your larger clients, maybe I traded over $1MM on your site so far and had over $50k with you on the 5th October, how about replying on my Reddit/BTC thread which was on their front page all weekend and mentioned to JShock in chat so you know about it, I've acknowledged every withdraw that I've been able to make there so why not post when I can expect to be made so called tier three and get the rest of my money out?
Jim Shock told me on chat that I was the number one withdraws issue to sort out, so what do you do, ban me and ignore my support emails, unbelievable, totally unprofessional.
Kindly reply if you are permitted to do so, thanks,
@_date: 2015-11-08 10:27:46
New day &amp; my second 3.4 BTC W/D has been sent, still waiting on 300 DASH and heard nothing from Cryptsy about when they will make me Tier 3 and if they need any additional info from what I'd already sent to be fully verified in the past for this, so that I can W/D the rest of my now 66 BTC.
It says "Show Withdraw Limit $-559.5796975" so apparently I have a negative W/D limit atm, they are well aware of this Reddit thread but choose not to come here and explain themselves, they continue to fail to communicate with me even though according to their support JShock on the chat I am the number one W/D issues priority to solve.
Edit to add: When I tried to post this in their chat it now appears that I'm permanently banned from posting there. Emailed the above post to support, plus:
So Cryptsy, why do you not reply or make me Tier 3 as you said you would, why do you not allow me to withdraw my own money, why are you so intent on destroying your reputation and business, it is really beyond me, I have acknowledged the three W/D that you made for me in the last 24 hours, as soon as you solve this issue then I'll be happy to post that as well, in the mean time ppl suspect that you do this because you do not have the coins to return any more, because that has been the case with all the other failed exchanges in the past that refused to let their clients W/D for over one month.

I just tried this again with an attempt to W/D 100 DASH, it gets confirmed and then just sits as pending, it's taken out of my balance but just disappeared, no pending withdrawal shown on my balances page, it remains stuck like the two small BTC W/D that I tried yesterday with no way for me to cancel them same as the original 76 BTC W/D that was finally cancelled by them but doesn't help any as I can't W/D anything at all, just use it as play money to put walls or whatever on Cryptsy, useless IOW.

Thanks for the offer, after quite a few days of having a negative withdrawal allowance on Cryptsy I saw that it had reverted to $2,000 again, so I've just initiated a 6 BTC &amp; 200 Dash W/D, touch wood it looks like they may be sorting their mess out, though they continue to ignore my support tickets and I'm perma-banned from their chat.

I did eventually get the withdrawals cancelled, but I still can't withdrawal anything, tried twice doing 3.4 BTC yesterday and they are now stuck, conf &amp; pending, but taken from my balance which says no outstanding withdrawals, just like when I tried to take out 76 BTC over one month ago.
@_date: 2015-10-12 23:03:26
I had over $50,000 on Cryptsy on the 5th Oct, I sold (at a loss) for BTC, LTC &amp; DASH, I was able to withdraw the 8,433 DASH, but the 2,886 LTC &amp; 76.24 BTC have been stuck there for over one week, I was then locked out of my account and dealing with support has been a nightmare, fobbed off with 'you're in a queue' or ignored mostly. **I would not advise risking any funds here atm.** Will update on developments...

My so called tier limit is actually overdrawn apparently, I can take out nothing.
Here's the latest from their chat logs:
Plus all the WD difficulties ppl are claiming in chat are keeping newcomers from wanting to send it here I'm sure
 just finished reading your thread, gl with that problem
Yall are thinking with spot minsets.. do you even realize that leveraged futures trading drives the entire price of btc? lol
JShock ♔
 totally understand your frustration. We know withdrawals are slow.  With all the upgrades we have had, bugs have developed.  Please know that we are aware, your balance is safe and that we are working on fixing the problems.  We do hope to have all these withdrawal issues resolved very soon
no ones waiting for the price to go back up..LOL.. their waiting for it to go down to close shorts @ 20x Leverage..LOL
 I made 5 or more consecutive calls on that coin and played the dash boys like a fiddle...
 what do you mean by burning? Angry?
 possible to get someone to look at ticket  again?
 :)
I think the Fed reserve is gearing up for their rate increase soon, possibly in December
 can send you 1 tek as payment for your advice if you like
or not
 why I have a warm place in my heart for the dash boys...Evan and of course vertoe !
They are claiming the US Dollar is still gaining strength, and that US jobs are coming back with only 5% unemployed rate. It's all a bunch of BS though
Digging, many thanks, JShock - over one month for over $20,000 of coins is unacceptable.
 the only guy to ever give me a decent tip here...you always get my knowledge for free! As long as it's between us
PMs are being heavily manipulated downward to give the false impression of a strong US dollar, while the jobs numbers are straight up wrong. Unemployment is closer to double their numbers. It's more like 10%
JShock ♔
 I agree and you are 100% correct.  Some had to do with tier levels then other bugs developed from there.. Please know were working on it
 Yep
 i could help
JShock, you could just manually send me my coins, it is not difficult, the longer you don't the more ppl will believe that you do not have them.
 know you are my boy here right ...well Horus too...give the man his money and move on
JShock ♔
 Its not quite that easy.  The system is connected to everything
 I am certainly one of those waiting for it to go down, but I do know ppl who think it will go up again. 
 that Judge judy guy...never gave me one tip even though I rained major tips on him on cryptopia...lol 
 will leave you stripped and nekked in the parking lot if you give him a chance
JShock ♔
 Your withdrawal is in my priority list of accounts to have developers look at. 
 true...literally!lol
My btc withdrawal is  pending since more than 3 days. Any issues anybody is aware of?
JShock ♔
 I do however only see two smaller w/ds.
JShock, any system can be manually overridden, just get my coins out of your dysfunctional system and return the to me. You know how many, you either have them on some cold wallet or not, you know my addie, so don't make a simple thing in to something that it isn't please.
 it will.. but it wont surpass that 574$ 30-40 bux  Ican see.. but it should stair step down with some nice swing plays for the next 30-60 days
Jshock, My btc withdrawal is  pending since more than 3 days. Any issues you or anybody is aware of?
JShock ♔
 Yes, withdrawals are slow right  now..
JShock ♔
Working on it
the margin calls will be grand tho.
JShock, it doesn't need developers to look at it, that's your business after you've gone to your cold wallet and sent me back my coins, one day max, close my account after np, it's hardly likely that I would ever send money to Cryptsy again, who on earth would after what you've put me through?
 wouldnt give your job to a monkey on a rock during this time of tribulations
Jshock, how many days more should I be waiting? it has been 3 days
 lol
 I'd really like to see $260 again, but I don't feel like it will happen
 pressure must be enormous
 let me help clear one off your list, just want to cancel my withdrawals. 
allwyn445 in my experience I'd allow another 29 days min.
 WD is an understatement
but GL with that if it's in the tens of thou of dollars

He liked to use the Internet in public libraries, being public &amp; having a ton of books also make them very good hiding places for info dead drops, using perhaps the old microdots  for false fullstops/periods with QR code private keys on them, or even invisible ink or something he'd need a way of remembering which books in which libraries &amp; some backups elsewhere too.
Say he wanted to stash 100,000 btc this way split up in to 500 btc chunks, in 50  different libraries (which are anywhere from SF to Texas to Australia to anywhere), then that's just 4 books per library (or that times 2 or 3 in case some are out on loan), best to pick books that are not too popular but still likely to be retained.
Or don't use the books at all, just the libraries &amp; other public buildings like museums &amp; galleries then hide the micro dots in secure but memorable places in them.

I look forward to your annual updates, I think that Bitcoin will reach critical mass for widespread adoption in 2017 especially in the States. Personally I would start paying down your loan every time you reach 100% profit sell half of those coins, so say you'd bought $3,000 worth @ $14 then when the price hits/hit $28 sell 107 coins, this allows you to pay back the $3,000 original cost &amp; effectively hold 107 coins long term with no risk. If you wished to stay more high risk then only sell a quarter of all coins (&amp; SD shares etc) that double in price to start with, for lower risk sell all coins that double in price until you have re-payed your loan, or most of it, then keep the rest - which will still be a decent amount.
Are you now fully 'invested' @ between $14 &amp; $25 - what's your average buy in price $19.50 ? 
@_date: 2013-10-11 12:28:58

Something else that you could do is to create a vanity address for her, her name or something she likes perhaps, then send the coins to it &amp; give her a blockchain.info or paper wallet. 
Alternatively make her a brain wallet address &amp; send the coins there, say something like: 'Happy birthday Sussie here are some Bitcoins from your brother novacog and this is the passphrase for them xox' 
I would also keep a copy of the private key for the coins that you give her in case she losses it or the wallet etc.

At the time of the OP writing (about 4 hours ago) 228,251 blocks have been mined for a total of 10,956,300 Bitcoins. Multiplied by the Gox highest price just now of $89.245 per bitcoin, brings us to a Market capitalization of $977,794,993.50 
Looks like it won't be long before I shall be paying out with double prizes is what will happen soon afterwards:
(In the approx 4 hours since the OP I think that's about 600 bitcoins extra mined, which I haven't included)

I think that Bitcoin will reach critical mass in the US by 2017, whatever the price is around then will be it's permanent floor going forward imo - the upside I see as huge &amp; the inevitable competition I see as very healthy, Bitcoin will always be the gold standard &amp; valued for being the first with some Alts perhaps being more popular - just as not everyone drives a Rolls Royce.

Probably depends which country you're in, I use Bitstamp in the EU.
You could also sell privately or on a localcoins site perhaps.

The company asked if they could operate as an exchange there, presumably for Bitcoin, Baht, USD, etc &amp; were told no the couldn't. I think that the next step they were meant to take was to ask how much this would cost to fix &amp; who to pay it to, instead they missed the clue &amp; exaggerated the whole thing for the sake of drama to call it Bitcoin use is illegal.
They call themselves Bitcoin Co. Ltd which is another exaggerated delusion giving a false impression, like calling oneself the Internet Co. Ltd would be, stupid.

"It would be for a long term investment (2 years ?)" I'd call that a medium term at most, I'd advise to hold for at the very least 4 years &amp; to keep adding to your holding throughout that time, I expect BTC to reach a critical mass of adoption in the US by 2017 &amp; for it to be very controversial in the run up to this.

Sadly you're not the first &amp; won't be the last  My advise make a savings plan in either € or better still btc &amp;/or ltc, put in whatever you can &amp; when you've eventually built back your savings to what they were before then perhaps if you haven't gambled since your wife will begin to have some faith that you have learned from your mistakes.

When someone with a huge fan base, like Lady Gaga with over 40 million followers on twitter &amp; nearly 60 million FB likes or Justin Bieber etc, realizes that they can easily raise a large sum in micropayments from their fan base for any charity or project, like the $1 million she personally donated to the Red Cross for Sandy hurricane relief, just post a 1LadyGaga vanity address &amp; QR code or some such also once one of the big social network sites incorporates Bitcoin tipping/donating/purchases with a single click btc will be home &amp; dry.

I made this intro guide for friends &amp; ppl who asked me to buy &amp; look after some coins for them until they felt confident enough to take charge of them themselves, the same sort of amounts that you are planning to put in, it's a bit wall of texty atm - sorry, but there may be some useful info on there as it emphasizes security of managing &amp; storing ones coins.

John Paffendorf, partner in a $900 million Private Wealth Management boutique that operates within Morgan Stanley, had a one-word reaction to Bitcoin: “Illegal.”
Yep, he's either spreading FUD &amp;/or he's an idiot, obviously Bitcoin isn't illegal, maybe he didn't bother to research this (ie 30 seconds on Google) &amp; remembered hearing some US Senators going on about the Silk Road, anyway Morgan Stanley should be asked if they endorse this fallacy &amp; exactly which statutes they think it may breach if so.

Yep, I had that dream too (original Alt variation) back in Nov 2012 
"Re niche uses, I'm thinking fairly low value uses where also waiting for a few confirmations isn't a problem, one potential enormous world wide one could be parking fees as the vehicle is going to be there for like at least 10 minutes for plenty of ltc confirmations &amp; it would give an alternative to paying in cash, one could even top up one's fee if that's permitted by smart phone etc at a distance if the ticket machine generated a new address for each client &amp; visit, it could even perhaps do away with tickets altogether if you just punched in your vehicle registration number, it then gives you an address to send to for that visit &amp; when a warden comes round they just download the info in to a hand held device to be able to check against the vehicles parked in that zone. In the future your vehicle may just connect remotely to the paying system &amp; do this for you - you just tell it how long you plan to stay or it keeps topping up until the maximum allowed visit time &amp; sms you an alert, would also work well for congestion zone charges."
Then I bought some more ltc on the strength of it, I plan to hold until the parking meters become waking life, after that my chauffeur can deal with it.
I believe that David laSeek, a ltc dev, ran with this one so hope to see these soon on the calles of Barcelona where I often park up.

If you try &amp; enter a bet that is over the limit then the 'profit' box turns red to show this is not possible, same as the 'bet size' box will do if you have insufficient funds on your balance.
You may not see top right just under the ads the 'Max profit per bet is currently: xyz BTC' if you have add-block or perhaps no scripts or something on in some browsers, but it's all very clear how it all works if you check the FAQ.

You can ask them to credit a bank anywhere in the world, so a UK buyer would deposit cash in your UK bank just as Canadian buyers do with Canadian banks, Bitcoin-Brokers did say when the started that there were some coins available via cash deposit to Lloyds bank, UK - but I've yet to see it listed, they didn't answer my post asking about it, anyway I expect to list some there with Lloyds deposits next month hopefully.

Yep OP, you were very lucky they didn't either consider that you were bringing in a large amount of money undeclared or that you intended to support yourself during your stay by selling some of your large amount of Bitcoins to people in the states, like they did with nefario that could be seen as 'working' illegally, bringing in stuff to sell is not the way to go even if it is all in the cloud anyway, much better not to have any mention of btc at all &amp; just say you will use your debit/credit cards to pull cash from an ATM for your needs or charge on your cards, still good to see they didn't stomp on you &amp; I expect nefario was irritating enough that they were doing the US a favor by sending him back to China.

I've signed up, great to have another exchange where ltc can be traded, looks professional - I like the 2FA options, re verification some instructions on how to use PGP would be useful - probably I'll just wait until you enable secure uploads, also I only have one photo ID - a passport, no ID cards in my country, non photo driver's license, no photo birth certif, imo a bank would never ask for more than a passport.

I think 5 years plus is an ideal time frame to invest in Bitcoins as by then I expect it to have gained wide recognition &amp; acceptance, especially in the US market, any time that it goes in to bubble mode (&amp; there are bound to be a few more of those) or you wish to bank some profit then I would use  to park funds in silver that can be traded in &amp; back out of fast if you wish or just held long term.

Rita hi,
Very many thanks for sorting out my transfers so professionally, your telephone calls &amp; help to me as a first timer were really appreciated,
likewise your kind offer to credit me the wire fee of GBP 14.05 from the next time I make a GBP transfer.
Here is a question for your team that I posted on a Bitcoin Internet chat forum:
Last week I used their money transfer service XE-Trade to send money from GBP in the UK to € in Spain &amp; to $ in the US, they were great for this with fantastic personal service over the phone &amp; easy to set it all up via Internet,
I shall ask them to look in to also taking/sending BTC deposits as part of their currency exchange &amp;  transfer services offered &amp; will let you know their response.
I see that some people have contacted xe.com to inquire about listing the virtual currency Bitcoins on the exchange &amp; thought to likewise ask XE-Trade
to look in to this also if the currency becomes more main stream in the future.
With kind regards

I've had about half a dozen payments back so far on this game, it would be even better if with Litecoins imo for faster confirmations &amp; better if you had to include a 0.001 btc miner's fee 9under 3 cents) to keep it moving fast, bitbear ( a competitor copying the theme) just froze the game for over 5 hours by not including a miner's fee - anyway it's between 2 &amp; 3 btc atm &amp; working well again.
