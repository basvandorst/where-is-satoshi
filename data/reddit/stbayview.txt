The CME is an exchange. They don’t and can’t legally short or go long anything. They can however provide an exchange where their clients have the ability to short cash settled futures. Which are cash made bets on where the price of bitcoin will be at a future point. There is no delivery of bitcoin or any bitcoin being held by these exchanges. As of now, it’s all cash settled.

So the futures are “cash settled” so they will have no direct effect on the price of bitcoin other than its influence on traders who do trade bitcoin. If and when an ETFs get approval they will have to purchase and sell bitcoin directly and that could have a tremendous effect on the price.

Student loan debt is low interest rate debt. If you study business this is known as good debt, since it’s low interest. Put the money in bitcoin and pay student loans off slowly. Pay off credit card debt soon, that’s bad debt cause it’s high interest. Best of luck!

You don’t have a good understanding of how hedge funds would short. When a fund shorts they borrow from a broker who usually supplies the underlying asset with available shares from one of their clients who hold them as long positions. Hope this helps you better understand.

You can do it with him or for him. The fact that futures are going to be traded means we will see options coming and then ETFs to follow (I work in finance). This legitimizes the bitcoin space to Wall Street and also gives them legal ways of trading/hedging bitcoin without directly buying and holding them. That means a lot of capital will flow into the derivatives and some derivatives like the options and ETFs will have to deal with the actual underlying asset (even if cash settled). In other words institutions will have to buy large amounts of bitcoin. There are only 21 million bitcoin and 7 billion people. The price will fluctuate tremendously, higher beta then most traders are used to, but if you buy and hold long term and the market takes to bitcoin you will do very well in the long run.

You would sell it on the exchange, they may or may not have daily limits in four years, but if they do you would have to sell a little each day and then transfer it directly from the exchange to your bank account. Be sure to report your capital gains.

How so? The futures are used to hedge for people who already own the underlying (in theory, there are also lots of speculators). As far as I know these contracts don’t allow for delivery of the underlying. Options contracts usually have the option for delivery of the underlying even if cash settled, but I don’t believe the same is true for these specific cash settled futures.

@_date: 2017-02-17 12:52:25
If the ETF gets approved you should have bought before. If it doesn't get approved you should have bought after. Approval means certain companies will invest in bitcoin out of their mandate, like funds. So based on simple supply and demand the price will go up. If it doesn't get approved the weak hands that only bought based on the ETF approval will sell and the price will drop. It's probably best to hedge your bets and buy some before and some after. Though, if you have a gut feeling for one way or the other I would recommend following your gut, it's usually right.
@_date: 2017-02-09 06:40:34

If it happened it would probably start with a very small economy, like an island nation. They would most likely do it for fiscal reasons, like being cheaper then running a central bank and printing money. I know some Islands have started experimenting with colored coins that represent their fiat. I believe t0 purchased the company that did this. I wouldn't be surprised if this happened in a decade when Bitcoin is more established.

Bitcoin adoption has increased since 2013. Coinbase alone now has 5 million customers worldwide. Blockchain now has over 11 million wallets in use (yes, some of them are owned by the same users). Both of those companies had far less users in 2013. And no Mt.Gox did not have enough users to account for that growth. You have to realize that Bitcoin is a new currency, and adoption will be slow. If you study numismatics you would know historically new currencies always have a slow adoption rate, unless they are forced upon civilians by government. Those of us who use bitcoin choose to do so of our own free will, and I would argue an increase in adoption (even if it's slow) is an amazing thing if you think about it. It sounds to me that you don't have faith in the bitcoin system, so you should choose not to use them. And shut the F up.

Do not tell her. As you said, you already have not told her, which she may take offense to (some think not telling is like lying). Divorce rate is 50%. You’re self employed, so you will need money from time to time. Like you said, it’s a lot of money, but isn’t “life changing”, so there is no need to tell her. Not telling her, hurts no one. Telling potentially causes more problems, then you can even think of (I’m your age, but my parents divorced over money, and my father was very successful). Best of luck, but I personally would not tell.

Yes, people underestimate the impact of CME futures, which will lead to ETF approval. Once we have ETF’s the will have to purchase large amounts of bitcoin. Even the short bitcoin ETFs have to borrow bitcoin from an institution that already owns and holds it. That means the buy side is heavily favored for the first year or two after futures/options/ETFs since institutions will have to load up on them just for making markets (Buy and Sell sides). To the moon!!!

This argument is flawed. The Bitcoin network is far larger then you realize. Bitcoins value lies in the network size. There are over 1000 cryptocurrencies, some created by millionaires doing exactly what you suggest and Bitcoin is still the biggest and most robust with no sign of slowing down. Those other altcoins are mostly crap, and any viable ideas brought forward by them could eventually be added to Bitcoin using the BIP process. Realize millions of people in countries all over the world already actively use bitcoin BY CHOICE. Don’t underestimate the network effect, look at Facebook, even when it went public no one thought they’d ever be profitable and now they are the most important social network.

Generally, when you sell that large of a quantity you do it as an auction. It will not have a direct effect on the price as long as the price isn’t too different from exchange prices. Auction prices are recorded separately, Gemini holds daily auctions.

I’d say yes. If Bitcoin goes up 10 times then it’s 5 Thousand Pounds! I’m guessing over time it will keep increasing in value. Also too many exchanges get hacked or accounts get hacked or the exchange hires a “bad actor”. Buy a Trezor or a Ledger Nano S and be your own bank.
@_date: 2017-11-26 00:41:51
Bitcoin is following an S curve, like most tech adoption. At the point where the curve starts to straighten out we will have such adoption that the increase in value would be minimal (almost like fiat inflation only it would be minimal deflation). So it won’t be a big deal at that point.

Around $1 million each, when one Satoshi is worth a cent. Then it’s volatility will be similar to current fiat fluctuations.
@_date: 2017-11-14 07:19:33
The current price is based on the spread of the bid and the ask. When you purchase, you purchase at the ask which would be higher then the current price. When you sell, you sell at the bid, which would be less then the current price. That’s how markets work, Coinbase is legit.

A number of reasons... they specialize in security, and do the logins for tons of crypto companies and other wallets, I really like the interface it’s very fluid for me, I like that you have the option to put tons of info in the transaction section and can put notes then search for specific transactions by keywords. If you use Bitcoin a lot it’s truly an awesome feature. Anyway, download a bunch of wallets, they’re free, and try out the interfaces, find one you like then do a little research and make sure it’s secure. Best of luck!

It’s a store of value. It will continue to go up in value over time because it is inherently deflationary due to the halving that happens about every four years.

Geez the guy who ran a mint, thinks gold and silver are undervalued?! What a shocker! So does everyone at r/gold and they need a reason to believe that they haven’t been wrong about investing in precious metals for years with little gains. Most people can’t accept when they’re wrong so they look for excuses instead of accepting facts. Anyway, the guy who runs a mint is told how much coinage to make and knows more about metal working then economics. I’ve worked in the equity markets for almost 20 years and I can tell you that from my experience the buy side (meaning long positions) is always heavily favored when derivatives are first launched. We are most likely in for a couple year bull market, with crazy volatile corrections every couple of months. It’s going to be awesome!

I’m a long time user, trader, hodler, of Bitcoin. Got involved at the end of 2012. I don’t believe we’re in a bubble, but I do believe we are in a hype cycle. Usually the price will increase rapidly, week hands will sell since they bought into the hype and not the tech like the hodlers. The price will correct, but still be higher from where the previous hype cycle ended. The problem is, it’s impossible to tell if this is the beginning, middle or end of this hype cycle. My guess is this is the beginning of the middle. $10k seems like a physiological level where a lot of people will cash out/spend, especially those sitting on a bunch of coins even if it’s just part of what they hodl.

That seems like a scam, IMHO. Been in Bitcoin since 2012, and even back then you had to use tons of GPU’s or the new at the time ASIC’s to get that much.

Ah, gotcha... yes, that is sound advice :)

If you’re a coin collector it is, otherwise just buy bitcoin.

Personally, I like Earn... I started using it a while ago when it was still 21. I’ve made about $250 so far (a couple of years). Not sure if I’m “popular”, but I did connect all of my social media and GitHub accounts. Mainly get paid a few dollars at a time, for answering questions, mostly on ICO’s. Hope that helps! Best of luck!!!

I’ve been a Numismatist (Coin collector) my whole life. DEFINITELY buy them back. That spelling error is most likely a misprint which makes those coins, which are already rare, even more so. I agree with you, 20 years from now collectors will pay a huge premium for those coins.

This is horrible advice. First you should build up enough investments to be able to live six months without being able to work (in case sh*t happens). Then you should build up a retirement account, for when you’re older. Most people who “invest in themselves” fail at whatever they try and end up destitute and have to rely on people who were smart enough to save and invest (talking from experience). Just look at the statistics of success businesses, 90% fail in first 5 years. Chances are, you’re in the 90%.

I think it’s a good idea! Run with it, don’t listen to haters!

Airbitz IMHO. Try out a couple interfaces and find one you like. Good luck!

You don’t need to buy a whole coin, just buy as much as you can afford to invest in bitcoin. Coinbase is a good place to start.
@_date: 2018-02-25 22:46:30
I wonder how many “throw away” accounts are subs?

Bitcoin is software used by people who actively choose to use it. Even if the government makes a FEDCOIN people can still choose to use Bitcoin. And the fact that the Bitcoin ecosystem continues to grow year after year on a voluntary basis is a testament to the fact that it is a better form of money.

Breadwallet sucks, I like Airbitz, but there are a ton of good wallets out there. Upgrade to something better!

This is misleading. There are currently NO bitcoin ETF’s approved by the SEC. GBTC (Grayscale) trades OTC (over the counter) and is a Trust not an Exchange Traded Fund. And as far as I am aware, GBTC does NOT have options. This is just an ad for a new app.

Hodl or you will regret it. You are not alone in your addiction or frustration. There are a ton of early adopters who are right there with you. Remember the excitement you had when you first got into Bitcoin and remember that there are and will only ever be 21 million Bitcoins and there's a world population of around 7 billion. The user base is growing and will continue to do so. HODL.

I like Airbitz... but I recommend downloading a couple and trying out the user interface on each and going with what appeals to you
@_date: 2018-04-21 16:56:49
Exactly! Coinbase is currently working with the SEC to become the first SEC licensed crypto exchange. They aren’t going to poke the bear while trying to play nice with it.
@_date: 2017-05-09 18:55:10
Just buy Bitcoin

My vote would be to call them "Motos" like Nakamoto. I think most people won't use milli or similar cause it sounds too technical and people tend to lean toward slang, like buck. 
@_date: 2017-05-27 05:02:15
Do it! The current user base is small, but growing. In the long term it'll be your best investment! IMHO

Good moral, but it sounds like it's promoting a scam.

I like Airbitz for iOS and Ledger for my cold storage. Everyone has different preferences, so I recommend downloading a couple mobile wallets and trying out their interfaces before moving your coins. That way you end up with one you like. Best of luck!

I like Airbitz, but I recommend downloading a couple and trying out the interfaces. Go with the one that feels good to you. Best of luck!

I'm also having a problem with them... been a month, got a group reply to my ticket today and doesn't even address my issue. For all of the complaints about Coinbase, they're still better than Kraken and that is just really really sad.
@_date: 2017-06-14 05:16:44
Airbitz is best!
