Doesn't this shit have a stop loss mechanic? If it does, nobody can complain. If it doesn't, you shouldn't be trading such a scummy commodity

You didnt need to explain the video, but I dont blame you for doing so because, like you, everyone I know in bitcoin seems to also feel like they are smarter than everyone around them, until their daily Facebook posts disappear when they lose 65% of their supposed down payment on their future house. Now they gotta pick up where they left off.... waiting tables ��
When that day comes I'll leave you a 25% tip because I feel bad for your confidence getting the best of you. We've all been there, though. Some of us just pay more for our lessons than others.

Nope, wrong on all accounts. Age 26, out of college for 5 years with gainful employment, contributing towards assets that will most likely exist in 20 years. And the people I know are up to 10 years older, diving into bitcoin, still waiting tables. And I haven't dropped a dime into bitcoin.
I don't take the price personally. I take personally when uninformed people get taken advantage of by anything of this nature: predatory lending, MLMs, televangelism, and bitcoin. All just tools to separate the uneducated from their cash.
But I should expect someone like you, a bitcoin "investor", to be wrong in all your assumptions. Although if you're only 1-2% in you're not as dumb as the rest of people, although if you're as old as you make yourself out to be, 1-2% of ones portfolio is a gigantic amount of money to fritter away.

This guy vouching for the authenticity of an asset where the all-time high was [proven]( to have been the result of price manipulation.
And then questioning my intelligence. But you do you, fam.

I'm not sure you understand that it may never reach that price ever again.

Oh you're right its reached $20k again several times, my mistake.
No wait, no it hasn't, because the peak and all gains on this shite were driven by pump-and-dump schemers.
Why dont you buy a safer investment, like Herbalife products or beanie babies?
