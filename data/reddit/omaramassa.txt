If you're in a number of 3rd world countries Bitcoin is Godsend.  We have the best banking in the world here in the U.S and in Europe, of course we don't need Bitcoin.  Most of the world does need crypto tho.  If you're hating on it because you can't spend it here in America or in any industrialized country you're not seeing the big picture.  Bitcoin isn't going away anytime soon and although another coin might take it's place in the future crypto will not go away.  
@_date: 2019-11-19 19:45:09
Eff it, not a bad way to die. lol
@_date: 2019-03-11 15:08:52
If the only reason you’re buying bitcoin is to make money ...  ����
@_date: 2019-03-04 02:28:47
Best one I’ve seen so far. This one has my vote 
@_date: 2019-11-04 16:02:07
Feeling sick due to the ups and downs of btc.
@_date: 2019-11-04 04:30:01
Don't get me wrong, I do feel like we as a society still need banks but I am glad that competition is here in the form of cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2019-11-04 04:26:09
Hahaha ... I can relate to this

Buy as much bitcoin as I can and start mining for it.
@_date: 2019-11-19 19:56:12
Ah no wonder the price is teetering on $7k / $8k.  I guess Black Friday is here a lil early for Bitcoiners.
@_date: 2019-11-13 17:49:46
Whoa, this is really weird.  Haven't read the article but hard to believe a communist country is one of the only countries in the world embracing crypto.  Almost makes me laugh. lol
@_date: 2019-08-12 15:51:09
Possibly, I am not perfect.  We'll see what happens as I am all in and if for whatever reason btc crashes there goes my savings.
@_date: 2019-08-12 14:39:28
Not always but in the next 5yrs it def will. Why, because there’s a huge need all over the world for a currency like btc. I’m not saying it will always be go up but at least for the foreseeable future. I put my money on it
@_date: 2019-08-25 00:43:34
It makes me curious as to whether this advertisement was paid for in bitcoin or fiat?  Skysports is yuuge and I am sure it wouldn't have been cheap.  I wonder ...

One of his best talks.  He was onfire with this one.
@_date: 2019-08-12 05:25:02
Risky?!?!  Only if you're not in it longterm.
@_date: 2019-08-26 17:36:20
Thank you for the reply, yeah, more businesses are starting to accept bitcoin. YAY!!!!!

@_date: 2019-10-25 17:10:39
Mahfukrs be getting overly excited overly quick.  I do realize it's 10% hike but c'mon ya'll. LOL
I love it though ... Keep going up BTC!!!! :-)
@_date: 2019-08-12 14:36:01
There’s no guarantee you’ll be alive tomorrow it the chances are good. I feel the same about bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-10-10 23:06:45
I was wondering where the 4% bump stemmed from.
@_date: 2019-10-09 21:52:13
Whaaaaaaaaaat, where did this come from?!?!  I am going to peep the price real quick.   WTH, C'mon ya'll?!?  It's a 4% bump are we that desperate we have to bust out with the roller coaster guy.  I need $600 by next week and was hoping to cash out a lil bitcoin but I can't till it goes back up to at least $12k.  Got my hopes up for nothing. smh
@_date: 2019-10-22 15:22:44
Hahaha ... That's me, all in and going deep.  All or nothing muthaeffers!!!!
@_date: 2019-10-01 18:43:08
A lot of people here discussing bitcoin price in the next 10 yrs?!?!  According to Aantonop, the ecryption protecting it's security won't be secure in the next 10 yrs due to quantum computing.
@_date: 2019-10-22 23:01:26
Totally agree brother. I’m just hoping that brighter future comes sooner rather than later. lol
@_date: 2019-10-22 23:00:49
My only issue is I’m broke till pay day now that I don’t keep money in the bank. ��
@_date: 2019-06-01 22:11:52
Naw, fiat is doing that on its own. lol  Bitcoin isn’t destroying it brother. They’ll exist alongside each other along with many others.  It’s just nice to have a choice now.  ��
@_date: 2019-10-24 15:36:48
When I think about bitcoin and all the reasons that make it awesome.  This has nothing to do with it.  Am I being negative? I hope not. 
@_date: 2019-06-27 15:14:14
Haha ... it's a damn fine meme sir.  Well done!  Looks like he's going long. lol
@_date: 2019-06-21 19:34:49
Someone email Andreas and ask him.  That dude is a btc sage.  For reals tho
@_date: 2019-06-17 18:20:32
Hahaha ... good one!
@_date: 2019-06-21 19:29:49
Good shit baby pops!!!  Keep buying next month.
@_date: 2019-06-11 03:48:16
Sir, you are clueless as to what bitcoin really is.  That’s ok, a lot of people don’t understand bitcoin but believe it when I say bitcoin is the flagship of crypto and crypto isn’t going away.
@_date: 2019-10-02 02:48:32
I hope it can, we’ll see. In tech things change so much. Btc may not be the dominant coin in 7yrs  much less 10yrs. I’m thankful for the revolution btc started though.
@_date: 2019-12-03 08:08:14
I give this post the big pow wow
@_date: 2019-12-11 22:18:02
Looks pretty legit to me ...
@_date: 2019-04-25 19:15:25
One of my smarter friends told me that 90% of the volume in BTC was due to manipulations by large exchanges.  Does this volume differ from that volume or is it just part of the fake volume created by the exchanges.  I am a noob to Bitcoin so  I am really trying to get an honest perspective.  Thank you!
@_date: 2019-10-26 17:26:58
Me too brother
@_date: 2019-04-13 16:08:16
You don’t.

Hahaha ... there’s always peeps that have funny ass shit to say to a mofo. A fruitfly indeed lol
If I die tomorrow I’m haunting your reddit. 
@_date: 2019-04-04 05:11:51
Thank you brother, you just solidify my decision to buy now.  Maybe in the end I needed to hear that. 
@_date: 2019-04-04 04:38:29
I’ve been meaning to buy but was waiting for my Tanda. Finally got it a few days ago and tried to buy through Coinbase but my bank cancelled the buy. I was lazy and didn’t try to buy right away, that’s when it started to climb and I was like “fack” this came out of no where. lol 
This is simply about timing not about where it’s been price wise. Thank you but you never answered my question. Are you happy it’s dipping down or not?  
@_date: 2019-04-04 23:32:54
My exact sentiments ����
@_date: 2019-04-04 23:29:12
Yeah, I know for sure, at least in my mind, that it will go up. I just wanted it to go down so I can buy some. lol 
I’m convinced that the more I try to time it the more I’m going to fail. lol
@_date: 2019-04-02 21:21:12
So true! 
@_date: 2019-04-04 23:30:53
I am a noob but I’ve been holding for a year now and will continue to buy from now on till I’m a savvy ol vet like yourself. ��✊
@_date: 2019-04-04 04:24:29
I do want to state I feel it’s inevitable that Bitcoin surpasses all previous ATHs therefore buybwhile it’s low people.  
@_date: 2019-04-02 18:03:09
Dang it, I was hoping it wouldn't come till after the 5th when I got payed. lol
@_date: 2019-04-01 03:58:45
Gawd, I hope it goes back down in a couple of days like this negative dude mentioned. 
@_date: 2019-04-05 19:26:14
@_date: 2019-04-04 23:27:43
Wow, I feel like we have the same issues and same philosophies when it comes to buying. Thanks for the advice brother. 
@_date: 2019-01-04 00:34:31
HAPPY BIRTHDAY BITCOIN!!!  Thank you for coming into my life when you did and thank you for changing the world.  I will continue to buy you every month regardless of the price in 2019. ��
@_date: 2019-09-11 17:32:32
Thank you for doing this bro.  I want to support too.
@_date: 2019-09-06 15:25:21
You have a great point but it doesn't change my opinion that he's kinda of a con man.
@_date: 2019-09-12 00:58:42


 It makes sense now lol
@_date: 2017-09-13 19:01:06
Logical and full of cents. lol  I am all in!
@_date: 2019-09-12 00:56:42
I hope this doesn't sound terrible but I wonder if he's being  incentivized to speak out like he's doing.  I am not against the message more the intent.
@_date: 2019-09-06 15:21:56
Daaamn ... best shitpost I've seen this week.  Nice job OP.

I feel Satoshi was an ancient alien that is secretly protecting civilization from itself by giving us the tech to balance the scale of life towards us, the everyday Joe.

You must not understand his role there.  Read up on it or there's an actual vid on his website where he explains his role there. He's not helping legitimize any type of rape. 
@_date: 2019-05-30 18:11:33
They must have hated and down voted the shit out of it. lol
@_date: 2018-12-05 21:16:52
So true, but I don't think he'll hate it.  He's too nice to hate it.  lol

No disrespect but I rather see and hear Andreas on JRE then Trace ... and I like Trace. 
@_date: 2018-12-06 00:29:32
Haha ... I guess we agree to disagree.

Maybe, but many people consider him a positive and balanced influence on Bitcoin and crypto currency in general.  Some people tend to exaggerate a bit on how super he is but regardless, to many of us that find him super this is more of a funny  yet accurate interpretation of what he represents to the crypto community.  Don't hate on the man.
@_date: 2018-12-18 01:02:53
“We have to change this soon”
Why?!?!  lol
