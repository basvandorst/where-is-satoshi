Exactly. It's absurd to think that anyone would pay if it were voluntary.
I just find it strange how much people defend an action that must be enforced with violence as just and reasonable. 
It's amazing what this sub has turned into. If you love paying taxes so much - pay extra! Nothing is stopping you.

If companies want to get in on speculating the future bitcoin price, I'm sure they would organize a proper way to do that. I don't think most medium/large businesses would half-ass their bitcoin investment strategy with just letting the users dictate how much they hold in BTC.
And it still doesn't explain why they should eat the costs of the customers transactions. Your assertions seem unreasonable.
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:45:01
When your margin short, you must put funds into your margin account for leverage against the BTC you intend to borrow. Once someone lends you BTC (with interest) you sell it on the market hoping the price of BTC will go down. Ideally, you buy it back at a lower price, make good on the loan and keep the difference - this is what means to sell short.
In this case, the price went up higher than the borrower was able to cover with the leveraged funds in there margin account. At this point, *all* of the borrower's funds in the margin account (in this case $2.3 million) are automatically liquidated on the market to make good on the original loan.

I think you're going to find a lot of your answers in the FAQ ---&gt;
1. No, you don't need a cell phone but it's helpful. To receive BTC you need the public address from your wallet (or a QR code that has your address in it). To send it, you need access to a wallet (app or web-based) with sending capabilities.
2. Yes, anyone can make a cryptocurrency. A few have some modifications that BTC chooses not to incorporate. For example, BTC chooses to be completely deflationary whereas Peercoin uses a %1 annual inflation to pay for it's validation process through a system called Proof-of-Stake (PoS). BTC can and will adapt new features over the years but some things are inherent to the coin that probably won't change. [Here's a calender]( of new altcoins coming out pretty much every day. Most are pump and dump or pre-mined schemes. But a couple here and there have genuine innovation.
3. Some banks have closed a few accounts but it seems to be pretty rare and under special situations. I don't know much about Canada's laws but I do know they were one of the first to install BTC ATMs so I'm pretty sure it's not illegal.
@_date: 2018-05-03 20:44:51
That's a reasonable point of view. Personally, I feel his 'power' (for lack of better word) and influence in the crypto world is only heightened by the BTC crowd talking about him so much.
I also think the hate tends to backfire when it's unwarranted. Ver does a lot of things that are manipulative and worth criticizing; but when people shit on him for frivolous shit, it just makes BTC fanboys look insecure and childish.

Although none of us really know how much Buffett knows about BTC, I would bet he did a little homework before making any sort of statement. He knows that his statements hold weight on wall street and wouldn't make comments just to hear the sound of his voice.

Why do you keep repeating this absurd statement? 
Despite the fact the BTC doesn't *try* to do anything; it's incentive based and an ever increasing value (while blocks are still being mined) is a necessary incentive. But at no point do the incentives dictate that it must have some arbitrary high value.
If the value increased linearly by only 1 dollar every year it would be more stable and arguably be a better currency than the one we have today. It would be more stable and the difficulty would simply adjust until it aligned more closely with the cost of energy.

Because every rally comes to an end followed by a correction period. Their were strong incentives to consolidate one's portfolio in BTC leading up to the segwit2x fork but now those incentives are gone and as people are re-balancing their portfolios, the rally will lose it's momentum and begin to retrace.
Considering the size of this last rally, I also expect a lot of people to take profits off the table which will also stifle upward momentum.

I don't know why they are overpaying so much. To put it in perspective on how much they are paying, they are the top 7 highest transaction fees today (.1btc each) with 8th place being 0.062433btc.
And they do this every day. That's insane.

If they delete your account, do they also keep your BTC?

I don't think that screencap is accurate. It looks like the page was not refreshed in a while and that tall green datum point is an accumulation of volume from the last time the page refreshed.
This link is the same exchange data without OP's glitch.

Reminds me of the saying "If *everyone* seems like as asshole, maybe you're the asshole"
Bitcoin is turning into that bully that only lashes out because deep down they hate them self the most.

That's actually really interesting. Why do you think they would want to do that? Unless they are forced to by some interpretation of the KYC rules it seems like a great way to alienate their consumers.
