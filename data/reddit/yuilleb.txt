I had only USD on Bitfinex at the time of this hack. Personally as a human being I'm happy to share 36% of my funds to prevent others from starving. I also like the potential to be paid back in full through equity or whatever these tokens are. I think you've made a good decision Bitfinex!

That's exactly the question I asked for clarification. If you sold BTCUSD are you in the same boat as someone who bought BTCUSD? From some comments zane made it sounds like only people who bought BTCUSD would be socialized. However when I asked him to explicitly update his post with a clarification of which position would be affected he declined to do so.

A USD lender on Bitfinex could make compounded returns of around 30% APR. These type of loans are in the same ball park of high risk credit loans. The reason lenders are paid so well is that there's a high risk they won't be paid back at all. Keep in mind the current risk-free rate for USD is well below 1% APR. There's a vary obvious reason lenders were making around 30% APR: they were high risk loans!

The good thing about the link you posted is it returns a png image.
wyrag: you're site seems to be returning a png, but the server is sending HTTP header: "Content-Type: image/jpeg". That might be the reason for some browsers not rendering the image correctly. Your server should be sending Content-Type: image/png instead.
Another slight error in your HTML is you have an ending "&lt;/div&gt;" that is not paired with an opening "&lt;div&gt;".

You're right, I was young when I opened my checking account and went with Chase as they were located everywhere.

@_date: 2014-07-07 02:09:33
Hi nullc,
Wouldn't it be used if showmyip.com returned 55.55.55.55? I think you're assuming it will simply return nothing because of a connection error or service error, but what if like the OP asks it returns something mallicious? From what I can see from the code LOCAL_HTTP takes priority over all other address sources other than LOCAL_MANUAL. So unless an IP is provided manually couldn't a malicious response from showmyip.com prevent even publically addressed nodes from advertising their correct IPs?
Also if you get a chance can you respond to my other question about why individual nodes advertise their own IP addresses on the network? I would think it'd be best if other nodes advertised on behalf of eachother, but I'd like to understand why Bitcoin operates this way. Thanks!
@_date: 2014-07-07 06:59:27


I did notice that, but I'm not sure I'm following. To make sure we're on the same page: my concern would be the case when showmyip.com returns a wrong IP address and the node in question does not have an IP manually set. For instance if I have a server with an publically routable IP on eth0 set as 44.44.44.44 (though not manually set by -externalip=), yet showmyip.com returns 55.55.55.55. It seems to me the node will advertise the incorrect IP 55.55.55.55 instead of the correct IP 44.44.44.44. I beleive this is the case because LOCAL_HTTP has a higher score than LOCAL_IF and both of them will occur only once. Did I get this right?
I suppose my concern is I would think most publically addressed computers would assume they would not need to explicitly set -externalip=, and thus would be in trouble if one of these HTTP services returned incorrect results.


To solve that how about just sending a control message after connection as to weather you want to be advertised or not? Something like "advertiseme". The main point that I'm concerned with is having the remote nodes advertise your IP on your behalf kind of solves the problem with figuring out what your public IP is. It removes the need for services like showmyip.com.
I would also think it might be a good idea to default to advertise only if not NAT'd. That could be solved by including the IP address the node thinks it's coming from inside the control message and then having the receiving node compare the two IP addresses to determine if it is NAT'd. This way if a node is behind a NAT device it would need to explicitly set that it should be advertised otherwise nodes won't even bother connecting to you (as the majority of NAT'd nodes are most likely unreachable).
By the way I know you understand using showmyip.com services are not the best solution (though I would agree showmyip.com returning incorrect IP address information is unlikely). I'm mearly trying to suggest an easy way to fix this would be to simply use the IP address that a remote node sees. I've used this strategy in many programs and had great success. I want Bitcoin to succeed as well. I'm even willing to attempt to submit a patch, yet I don't have the best knowledge of the code base yet.
Thanks again for your help!
@_date: 2014-07-07 00:21:40
You're right, but that doesn't have to do much with discovering your own IP address. The OP's comment was about how the local public IP address of a node is discovered. Not how remote nodes are discovered.

I had never heard anything about Chase closing accounts, but I'm guessing now that just not everyone went to the internet to warn people.
@_date: 2014-07-07 01:32:33
The only consiquence I can figure is that node would prevent us from connecting to a signle other node on the network.
If you had concerns with this then you could disregard this solution. Perhaps you could let the bitcoin node connect to itself (if it received it's own public IP in an advertisement from another node), only in the initial hello packet you could have a random number that is used to check if the sender is also the receiver.
Realistically I'm not sure this is a big concern as I don't know of many routers that will route a public IP back to the internal NAT'd address if the sender is on the inside network. So the concern of communicating with yourself is probably not a realistic problem.
@_date: 2014-07-07 01:54:48
The point the OP is making though is that those addresses you are querying from the network are addresses that were responses from showmyip.com.
If for instance showmyip.com started responding with 55.55.55.55 then all new nodes connecting to the network will advertise that address (unless they specify their IP's manually), which I beleive would make them unreachable to the rest of the network other than the base seed nodes which they originally connect to. I'm not sure what effect this would have on the network over time.
@_date: 2014-07-06 23:17:42
I might take a look at the source code later, but if anyone has a quick answer to this question now that would be helpful.
Why does the code need a thrid party to return external IP addresses? From my breif understanding of the network layer, each node communicates addresses of nodes it has established a connection to the rest of the network. I would think a good solution would be for the connecting nodes to provide their local IP address upon connecting (the address configured for it's interface). Then the receiving node would record the remote IP address the packet actually came from. If the two IP addresses are the same then the address would be retransmitted as is. If the addresses are different then the remote address would be marked as a NAT'd address and the real public address would be the one retransmitted to the network.
As far as I can tell no third party IP lookup is required. In fact I used this exact same logic for writing a SIP server (TCP and UDP transports), which correctly handles all NAT'd clients without a session border controller.
~~A simple subnet mask check could also occur that would prevent private network addresses from being retransmitted through the network.~~ edit: CNetAddr::IsRoutable() takes care of this.
**Update:** From what I have learned from the code, the node gathers a list of IP addresses to use from multiple sources. These HTTP services are just one of the many sources including specifying your public IP address manually. Here's the possible sources (which are also in ranking order of importance, LOCAL_MANUAL being the highest):
    enum {
        LOCAL_NONE,   // unknown
        LOCAL_IF,     // address a local interface listens on
        LOCAL_BIND,   // address explicit bound to
        LOCAL_UPNP,   // address reported by UPnP
        LOCAL_HTTP,   // address reported by whatismyip.com and similar
        LOCAL_MANUAL, // address explicitly specified (-externalip=)
    };
While using the IP address that is actually used in the network communication would seem to me to be the best solution, I don't see how the current code is of any major threat to the stabilization of the Bitcoin network like the OP suggests. Over time it might become a problem, but only someone with complete knowledge of the code can answer this.
@_date: 2014-07-07 01:59:38
It effects any node that is not using -externalip to set it's IP manually. If you look at the priority in the code, the IP returned by an HTTP service such as showmyip.com has higher priority than the IP configured on a local interface. So if showmyip.com starts responding with 55.55.55.55 to all requests, those new nodes will not be advertising their correct IP addresses. I don't however know how this would effect the network over time.

I thought the same thing. I even apealed this case to the branch manager. His response was they have the right to close an account for any reason at any time. I can understand that, but even a phone company gives you forewarning so that you have time to find a new provider. I do think that if I did suffer real damages from this I would be able to sue, but as of right now I think I'll be alright. Most of the companies I owe money are being very understanding towards my situation.

Please do NOT click the "Orderbook" button. That will leak your account information to anyone else accessing the same cache server that you route to in your region.
This is simply a read-only server side cache problem, but it apears to be localized to the cache servers of the CDN. So please to protect your account balance and username from leaking to anyone else who routes through the same cache server, do not click the Orderbook button.
If the OP could please remove that from their post that would be helpful in preventing unknowing users from clicking that link to see what happens.
@_date: 2014-07-07 01:45:57
Interestingly they are not used for fallback, as they are marked in the code a higher score than every list of addresses except that which is specified manually.
The order goes: LOCAL_NONE, LOCAL_IF, LOCAL_BIND, LOCAL_UPNP,  LOCAL_HTTP (these are the HTTP services like showmyip), and LOCAL_MANUAL

I filed a formal complaint with the "Executive Office" at Chase today. They say I should be contacted within 48 hours to be given a response as to why my account was closed. I'll consider pursuing this further if need be.
@_date: 2014-07-07 00:40:53
Nice, so the way to solve that is for node 2 to respond to node 1 after connecting with the IP address that node 2 will advertise on behalf of node 1.
@_date: 2014-07-07 00:32:33
I think it would help for someone to explain why a local node needs to discover it's own IP. I've designed and implemented p2p networks before and never did a node need or advertise it's own IP (execpt for broadcast discovery, but that's not how the Bitcoin network works). 
For instance: in a 3 node network, node 1 never needs to advertise it's own IP as long as it knows how to connect to either node 2 or 3. node 2 can tell node 3 the IP it sees from node 1, and so can node 3 tell node 2 the IP it sees from node 1. As you can see the network can learn about node 1's IP without node 1 ever advertising it to anyone. 
Since node 2 and 3 are doing the work of advertising node 1's IP address, trust is not needed as long as at least 1 of the nodes is not lieing then the true public IP address of node 1 will be advertised to the network.
@_date: 2014-04-03 22:33:49
Yup I agree, but after holding a decent balance with them for over 10 years, I can't figure how I posed a real threat. Anyway, I completly agree they have the right to turn down business, but for current business they should give some sort of forewarning as that's just want a decent human being would do. This being a legal requirement or not, they could really hurt someone by these actions.

You're not alone! As Down_With_The_Banks linked to my post, where this happened to me 4th of April along with many others (I can only imagine a small fraction actually posted on reddit). Don't let this upset you, instead thank them for giving you the extra push you needed to get your money to a safer bank. Chase almost went bankrupt due to poor risk managment of their trading desks, and other indicators are pointing to the fact that they're running short on cash. Just do some searching on the JP Morgan Whale.
By the way my learning experience from going through this is that Bitcoin is much safer than having your money with Chase. No one can seize your Bitcoins.

I've been making calls today and am finding out the majority of my automatic payments were rejected for this month, which is showing up as late payments for my monthly bills. Chase never even bothered to call me and let me know this was going to happen so I could prepare for all of my monthly bills being late.

@_date: 2014-07-07 02:23:41
Thanks for confirming this and for explaining what might happen to the network over time. I can see this wouldn't cause huge problems, but it does seem like it would make more sense to let the remote nodes advertise on a node's behalf. That way one node advertising incorrect addresses is OK because more likely than not at least one of the nodes will advertise the correct one.
@_date: 2014-07-07 18:13:42
Thanks for your detailed responses. So I'd think you should still allow a node to explicitly use -externalip= which can be communicated by the "addr" control message as normal. The new control message "advertiseme" would simply be used as a means of replacing the HTTP services.
My best experience is with the SIP protocol. If you're not familiar I'll explain quickly: each packet is normally transported over UDP which makes things worse with NAT (though transport can also be over TCP). Inside a new request to set up a call or register to receive new calls, the initiator will provide the IP address and port number called the "contact address" that it would like you to respond to. If that initiator is behind NAT and that device doesn't fix-up the packet IP/port data, the receiver of the call will try to send back to the internal IP address. When a new request is received, the receiver will log the acutal IP address along with the actual port number the request came from, which are called raddr and rport. SIP has retransmission rules or timers that decide when a reponse has failed. If the initial response to the "contract address" and port failed, then the response can be sent to the actual IP address (raddr) and port (rport) which the request came from, and if successful then that node would be marked in internal memeory as being NAT'd and all responses or requests would be sent to the raddr and rport instead of the provided contact address. Another solution would be to just try both the contact address and the raddr at the same time and use whichever one responds first (SIP has incrementing sequence numbers to prevent duplicate conversations from occuring). In almost all scenarios this works even between private networks using internal address spaces.
Most SIP rfc's recommend using STUN servers, but in practice the logic I described above is much simpler and works with all clients most importantly those that do not have STUN support.
So in essence I see Bitcoin has the "Contact address" part which can be transmitted via an "addr" control message, my suggestion would be to add extra functionality to tell the receiving node to perform an address advertisement on your behalf - replacing the need for these HTTP address lookup services.
As far as I can tell this wouldn't break any NAT'd nodes.
Please let me know if you think this idea is worth pursuing or if you think there is a major flaw, as obviously I don't have as much knowledge about the Bitcoin code base as you. I do think the OP has a good point that these HTTP services are unecessary so hopefully this idea could replace them. I also have years of C/C++ experience in telecommunications and networking and would be willing to attempt a patch if you do not have the time and would like the help.


I'm sorry I just realized what you meant by this. So it sounds like you were doing the exact same thing I'm suggesting only it has one further step of that peer sending your address information back to you for you to decide to advertise it or not. That sounds very reasonable. Can you tell me what control message provided this information and if your patch should still work with the current code base? If so I'm willing to test it for you.
@_date: 2014-04-02 18:29:53
In times like this when you're scared, try to remember this: A LOT of very intelligent minds are putting big resources in to Bitcoin and building the infrastructure of tommorrow to support it. They are not doing this because Bitcoin is worthless.
Bitcoin has tremendous value, but the price also shot straight up vertical over a 2 month period. That is not sustainable, so any fears in the market translate to people exiting for profits as they realize this price bubble is temporary and cannot hold. Ever hear of a company growing too fast? Same thing here. The sustainable growth of the BTC price must take place over a longer time horizon for the price to be properly supported in the minds of BTC holders. Going from $100 to $1,000 in one month is insane and no reasonable person can tell you that makes sense. So give BTC time to grow in a sustainable fashion.
I hope this helps you put your fears to rest. I could prove to be wrong, but I'm one of those guys who thinks BTC is amazing and am building a company around it. Personally I look at the technology as the base for expanding the utility of the internet. Mark Cuban made a good point when he said the excitement of the internet was no longer there (blogmaverick.com/2007/08/24/the-internet-is-dead-and-boring/‎). I think Bitcoin will bring back this excitement and bring many new applications that couldn't exist before.

I'm pretty sure the block size is still max 1MB. Segwit just effectively increases the block size by allowing more transactions in the same 1MB of space. Hope this helps.
@_date: 2016-06-04 22:47:01
It all depends on your goals. If you were looking to buy bitcoin only to sell it at some point for USD to then walk away and look for the next investment then I don't see any problems with doing that now. For a lot of people however, they are in bitcoin for the long run, expecting it to be a better place to store their wealth than USD. So for these people it makes a lot of sense to just simply hold rather than try to "trade" by selling now hoping to buy back lower. Trading is extremely difficult and the grand majority of people lose money doing it, so the best advice is to simply hold your investment.

Not sure why people dislike your comment, but I think it's very sensible. Trading is very hard, hence why most people lose money doing it.

In my opinion you have the right idea: if you believe in BTC simply hold onto it as a long term investment or a better place to store your wealth.

When the witness data is stripped out to send the block to non-segwit nodes I guess it's still &lt;1MB, that way those nodes will still think it's a valid block. Honestly I'm not very knowledgeable about segwit, but hopefully at least the page I linked helps.
@_date: 2017-08-24 08:51:51
This might be the best explanation ( Keep in mind while there are very few segwit transactions occurring I think just normal transactions remain 1MB limited.
Block capacity/size increase
Since old nodes will only download the witness-stripped block, they only enforce the 1 MB block size limit rule on that data. New nodes, which understand the full block with witness data, are therefore free to replace this limit with a new one, allowing for larger block sizes. Segregated witness therefore takes advantage of this opportunity to raise the block size limit to nearly 4 MB, and adds a new cost limit to ensure blocks remain balanced in their resource use (this effectively results in an effective limit closer to 1.6 to 2 MB).

The reason is USD is a terrible store of value that will inflate by 2% every single year. So as long as we have a choice to spend USD or BTC I think the rational, self interested, person will always choose to spend USD.
I think the only way to achieve what you're looking for is when merchants decide they'd much rather have BTC they will need to start offering incentives to get people to spend their BTC. Without the proper incentives, people are simply going to continue to hold.
So some might call it a bubble, I call it self interested people doing exactly what you'd expect.

Chase shut down all of my accounts (checking and 0 balance credit card) with no warning and refused to allow me to withdraw in cash. They forced me to wait two weeks for a cashiers check in the mail. The branch manager told me it was "from my Bitcoin transactions" (from Coinbase).
The point the OP is making is Chase seizes your money and could cause serious harm to someone that doesn't have access to money from any other bank. With Bitcoin no one can seize your money and force you to sleep out in the cold or go hungry.

Best advice: stop trying to trade. Trading is extremely tough as to succeed at it you have to do the opposite of what human emotions want you to do, which means fighting/understanding your programming. You just described the exact reasons most people lose at trading and I hope you recognized how hard it was/is to overcome those emotions. With trading if you have just one day where you are weak, you can lose everything. The majority of people lose at this game so do not feel bad. You love bitcoin, so instead just buy a small amount of them with every paycheck no matter the price. You will likely end up in a much better spot years from now than if you keep trading.

I agree completely that the profit motivation is required for Bitcoin to function as that's how proof of work works!
The trouble is that profit motivation is a double edge sword that increases centralization. Can't have your cake and eat it too it seems
@_date: 2015-08-17 08:23:30
Small blocks actually promote the increase of centralization more so than big blocks. The reason is as competition increases to get transactions inside a smaller block so will the fees increase. Once more fees are included in a block the profit motivation increases for miners to invest more capital in hashing power to beat the competition.
Though, I would argue centralization of mining is inevitable regardless of block size:

@_date: 2015-08-17 04:06:03
Well said. The only part I disagree with is that centralization makes it less secure. I think the miner's profit motivation almost ensures they won't do anything to harm people's trust in the network. They don't want to throw away their millions invested.
@_date: 2015-08-15 23:51:29
Agreed. I'm coming to the conclusion there is no technical reason for a block size limit, but that they are all theoretical/economic reasons (hopefully someone is still yet to post a good technical reason in this thread). That's interesting as it explains why this debate has covered for so long, I'm quite sick of it haha. I'd like it if we could just remove the limit and put a fork in this debate (pub intended).
As for centralization I can see how that is a real problem, but many alt-coins have started up specifically with the intention of stopping centralization. I don't recall any that reduced the block limit to try to curb centralization, all I remember is them using different "ASIC resistant" hashing techniques (which I believe are doomed to fail). The problem of centralization is a big one, but if you look around everything tends to move towards centralization (it seems to be some sort of universal truth that perhaps we are wasting our time trying to combat?).

Ok thanks for the info.
@_date: 2015-08-17 03:54:35
Very interesting idea. I really think bitcoin is awesome and now that I think about it, if it required mining just to operate I would donate some cpu time to mine blocks as a contribution to keeping the network running. At the moment though my cpu time counts for absolutely nothing as mining farms blow my pc's hash rate out of the water, which makes mining on my cpu pointless. Perhaps you're right and the only incentive required for mining is that people want a better currency system. Good thoughts, thanks for sharing them.
@_date: 2015-08-21 04:21:27
I have custom built software that generated this. However you can easily put together some of the simple php or javascript example code freely available and just have it run in the background checking their trade api every so often and saving it somewhere.
@_date: 2015-08-19 20:44:57
I think the convention comes from the fact that you really have two types of matching orders: the passive limit order that sits in the order book waiting for a trade and the aggressive party who forces the match to occur. When the matched trade is displayed as trade or tick data, the side of the aggressor is used to determine if it was a buy or sell order. Anyway it's just a convention used in markets to specify who initiated the trade. I've seen "execution side" used by bitcoin exchanges, but that seems to be something they came up with, as I've never seen that in conventional markets (though I only have detailed experience with with FX and Futures).
Also when you think about dealing with market data that uses "execution side" it becomes more cumbersome if you are looking for all the buy orders you have to actually look for all the execution side=ask. That's not intuitive. Much easier to just look for trades that say "buy" and you know that's a buy order :)
@_date: 2015-08-18 00:43:55
Sorry I assumed these were basic principals which everyone understood. Glad we can agree though.
I'm not sure why you say there hasn't been strong dominance so far? Do you know anyone who mines from home profitably anymore? There are even large mining operations closing their doors as the BTC/USD price has fallen (one prominent example:  There's now 70% of hash power controlled by an unknown group of people:  . Imagine who controls this 70%? Since no one mines from home anymore, and even large mining pools are unprofitable isn't it odd the hash rate is at all time high? I think it's safe to say those are private mining farms controlling that 70% and they are getting a bigger slice of the pie the more competition drops off (centralization).
Anyway I think we've strayed pretty far from the point: raising the block size limit actually decreases the promotion of centralization (though proof of work coinbase still promotes centralization). People for some reason continue to argue the opposite and this incorrect premise is causing this block size limit debate to continue ad nauseum. If people simply understood that having a block limit actually promotes centralization I think this whole debate would die down significantly.
@_date: 2015-08-19 01:43:06
Can you point out where they claim to have protections against margin call or stop cascades? I remember hearing about their "speed bumps" and watching them happen, but that was with their old matching engine. Now they are running on Alpha Point's engine I believe and I've not heard of any such protections with that platform.
You're right, if they claim to have those protections then you have been wronged as they clearly had nothing in place to halt the market or allow a cool down period before liquidating more margin calls.
@_date: 2015-08-19 18:38:07
I listened to the CEO on whaleclub and he said they only activate when a *market order is going to move the price by about 10%*. No large market orders like that were submitted yesterday I guess. I have the trade history as well and it seems to back that (looks like lots of smaller orders selling). 
@_date: 2015-08-16 00:58:47
Agreed, about the current debate attacks. When I say "technical reasons" I actually mean like software programming or protocol design reasons for the block limit. Economic theory is not what I mean by technical. It's fine for people to debate theory, but I was just curious if there was an actual fundamentally technical reason for the code to require a block size limit. So far I have not found one. I've reserved commenting in this block size debate so far, because I couldn't see any technical reasons for why there should be a block size limit or not. I tend to avoid debates where it's really just a matter of opinion who is right as the result is both sides just end up getting worked up and no one really progresses.
Thanks again for your answers to my question.

No market maker likes to be arbitraged.. Your profit is their loss. Since they're running their own market they have the right to decide who they want to trade with (normally people they make money from). When someone you are arbitraging asks what you're doing, next time you say: "speculating on price movements" :)

He explained the way the "speed bumps" work, and said that they have not activated in more than a year because they were not triggered. The way they work is if someone purposefully or unintentionally submits a market order that will move the price by about 10% or more the speed bumps get activated. He said no orders like that occurred yesterday and thus the speed bumps never activated. Instead he said it was a lot of different people all selling.
I posted the trade history from the selloff here if you'd like to review it (I don't see any massive market moving orders either):

I think you're forgetting only one mining participant will solve the next block. The only market I can think of that's close to this is high frequency trading, and there are only a handful of players left standing in that market - no diversity whatsoever as the barrier to entry is enormous.
As for your second argument you forget that if you control more than half the hash rate you are the biggest mining firm and thus have no competition to drive you to invest more capital. If a mining firm acquires more than 50% of the hash rate, can we not agree mining is centralized at this point?
@_date: 2015-08-19 01:59:31
Good source. Thank you!
@_date: 2015-08-16 20:00:09
Could you please explain why centralization is believed to be anchored to the block size limit? The block size limit has been 1MB for some time now, and centralization of mining has been well underway. I'm under the impression that hash rate and the cost of obtaining it is what is driving centralization.
By the way I like the BIP100 proposal, thanks for bringing it to my attention.
@_date: 2015-08-17 00:35:58
Please read this to understand why limiting the block size actually promotes centralization: 
@_date: 2015-08-15 23:10:23
Wow Johnny, very nice and well thought out post! I agree with you about fishing as well. Thanks for taking the time to respond.
The issue I have is that the block size limit doesn't solve the problem of the mining arms race which will ultimately lead to centralization as we've seen already. At the moment mining hardware speed improvements have been the main way for miners to gain an edge. I can assure you network latency and bandwidth will also become a large factor and like QuasiSteve posted  Chinese miners are already starting to realize their bandwidth limitations are going to hurt them.
So the question becomes, if you want to stop the centralization of miners why would keeping the block limit which has been in there for quite some time stop the centralization which is already well underway?
By the way if you want to see a really good comparison to Bitcoin mining centralization do some google searches on latency arbitrage in electronic trading markets. You will find over the last 20 years only a handful of very large companies are left standing who've competed in this strategy. The reason is to have a latency edge it requires very large capital investments, which is exactly what we're seeing in Bitcoin mining.
@_date: 2015-08-17 01:06:05
It would probably make you look more intelligent if you would explain why you think that.

Thanks for informing me on how miners solve the block hash. I didn't realize it was just done on the header. I'll correct my original post so as not to throw people off on that topic.
You presented some good info, but again if it's a problem with bandwidth, wouldn't miners who want to win even on 1MB block upgrade their bandwidth so they can gain a latency advantage over the competing miners? If that Chinese pool doesn't have enough bandwidth or low latency connections aren't they likely to get beat up by competition who does?
If there's a speed edge it doesn't matter how small it is as long as you have even a nanosecond edge you win.

I'm sorry I have to agree with grasshoppa1, though he could have said it in a nicer way. This was a clear example of massive over-leverage that was bound to explode at some point. USD loans were up at $32 million 1 day ago while shorts were at relative USD valued lows. Such an imbalance can never last for long.
This isn't an example of the exchange doing wrong... It's a clear example of traders ignoring massive warning signals of huge risk!
@_date: 2015-08-17 19:00:49
There is a fixed supply of coins, and large barriers to competition. It is in the miner's best interest to continue to gain higher hash rates so as to beat their competition in mining new coins. By increasing their hash rate they then create an even higher barrier of entry for competition. This is a cycle which leads to centralization of mining by a handful of players.

Sorry Johnny, but the block size limit hasn't helped with centralization. As Maxwell stated in the link you posted: "So far the mining ecosystem has become incredibly centralized over time.
I believe I am the only remaining committer who mines, and only a few of the regular contributors to Bitcoin Core do. Many participants have never mined or only did back in 2010/2011..."
Plus this is taking more of a theoretical answer rather than a technical answer as to why there is a block size limit. I'd rather stick to facts about why there needs to be a limit (ie: software limitations, ect) rather than political or economic theories on why there should be a limit.
@_date: 2015-08-17 22:12:06
I think you forget that bitcoin mining is not like many other industries. The closest one I can think of is high frequency trading where there is a limited supply of trades which everyone is competing to capture. Only a handful of the largest players are left standing in that market, because they have invested huge capital to maintain their dominance and thus the barrier to entry is enormous.
You're right that's not how cartels operate, but that is how oligopolies do. You must admit it's only rational for the few remaining miners to simply split the market so that people don't get upset over one miner controlling more than 50% of the hash rate. It's an illusion of decentralization, but when there are less than 10 miners left can your really call that decentralized?
By the way, I should ask: do you mine bitcoins? If not, why? Perhaps you'll realize why the majority of bitcoin users stopped mining years ago.

You would simply end up in the same scenario only the warehouses/datacenters would be full of the fastest CPUs rather than ASICs. That is until a company figures out how to design an ASIC to calculate the "ASIC resistant" hash algo (look at Scrypt).

Thanks. Looks like 20MB was arbitrarily chosen as well: "I chose 20MB as a reasonable block size to target because 170 gigabytes per month comfortably fits into the typical 250-300 gigabytes per month data cap– so you can run a full node from home on a “pretty good” broadband plan."
I suppose this still leaves me feeling like I've never actually seen a true technical reason for why there is a block size limit...
@_date: 2015-08-19 01:52:39
Thanks for the link. The date of it suggests that might be how their old matching engine worked. I didn't see the "speed bumps" come into play at all today. I could have sworn they switched to Alpha Point's engine which would explain why these market stability features didn't kick in.
@_date: 2015-08-25 02:42:55
This doesn't seem like a compliance thing as much as it seems like they sold you some coins at a price they are no longer happy about. I remember this happening to some people when they tried buying from coinbase during the 2013 December panic sell off. This looks pretty close to your notice: 
@_date: 2015-08-15 22:59:39
Thanks again for the good info.
In regards to the Chinese it sounds like they've formed a cartel to protect their profits from competition who can get faster connections. Not sure this is a valid reason for block size limits either.
As for the 20MB/8MB link, I can't find where it discusses where these numbers originally came from? Gavin even mentions 11MB as it's his favorite number (a joke) :D. This post by nullc does have some good info in it though:

It's not manipulation when more than $8 million worth of leveraged long positions are forced closed because they were way out of position and ignoring the massive warning signs of huge risk. That was pure risk taken on by blind traders who are hurting very badly right now. I feel their pain, but you cannot lay blame with the exchange.
Sure there are counter measures the exchange could take to prevent margin call/stop cascades, but it's up to the trader to find out if their exchange has such measures to protect them. In the end trading is always about personal responsibility and proper risk assessment.

The chip production market allows people to produce new or different products based on market demand. This is nothing like bitcoin mining. In bitcoin mining your edge has nothing to do with new ideas or features, but instead is solely derived from hash rate per kWh cost. If you can acquire a lower hash rate per kWh cost than your competition then you win. If you can't then you will lose as your competition can push you out simply by increasing their hash rate, which they will otherwise they leave profit sitting on the table. I understand that it appears solving a block is random, but the profitability is not, as there is a statistical probability that will produce an average profit per kWh invested over time. Think about a coin flip. It's random if it lands heads or tails, yet the probability outcome is not: 50/50%.
@_date: 2015-08-17 08:28:14
It doesn't matter if you beat the competition by 1 minute or 1 nanosecond. As long as you mine the block before your competition you win. The more you win the more money you will invest in more computers to gain a bigger hash rate against your competition. This continues the process of centralization. The only reason this stops is when profits are no longer covering expenses.
@_date: 2015-08-19 21:01:27
The best advice I could give is to only put money that you can absolutely afford to lose into BTC. As a student I'd imagine money is tight, and if that is your case, you should really have almost no money in BTC. If you use BTC regularly and want to have some to spend maybe $10 or $20 won't hurt you? However you shouldn't be using BTC as an investment vehicle when you don't have extra money you can afford to lose.
@_date: 2015-08-16 21:00:24
Sorry I can't follow that logic, as the block size has been fixed yet centralization is increasing. The only variable that has been increasing along with centralization is the hash rate. It's quite obvious to many people the reason the average bitcoin user stopped mining years ago was the cost of obtaining the hash rate necessary to remain profitable. Only the largest players are able to maintain profitability in mining and it has nothing to do with the block size limit. Centralization of mining will continue even if you drop the block size to limit 1KB.
@_date: 2015-08-15 23:57:02
Ok, that's a good answer though. I was honestly curious if there is a technical reason the protocol or software cannot handle unlimited block sizes. If there is no technical reason for the block size limit, that would explain why this seems to be such a heated debate because it's all conjecture and no facts.
@_date: 2016-09-08 18:25:30
I would suggest double checking that kWh pricing. Where I live in the US only the largest enterprises get access to pricing close to that and it's more like &gt;7 cents per kWh.
What deterred me from mining is decay on your initial hashing power. Lets say you calculate it will take 1 year to return your initial investment. The problem with that is it does not take into account the possibility of the total network hash rate increasing (which seems to be the trend). So as time goes on your initial investment is diluted as more hashing power is added to the network. So it ends up taking much longer to make back your initial investment, and if the exchange rate were to drop to the point that your revenue decreases below the cost of power you now start to actually lose money. I decided the better investment was to simply buy bitcoins with my money rather than hope to compete with subsidized electricity in China and other parts of the world. Ultimately to profitably mine in a country where power is not subsidized you need to count on the exchange rate increasing. Which if you're counting on that I think it makes more sense to just buy bitcoins.

From what I've heard Wells Fargo is rather friendly for whatever reason to bitcoin users. My Chase account that I had since early 2000's was force closed in 2014 with a similar letter as the OP after the branch manager told me it was because of my bitcoin transactions (I wired money to an exchange to buy bitcoin). I had at least 10 years of paying my mortgage, direct deposits from my paycheck, ect. I had moved the same large sums of money to my e-trade and other brokers before.

If you're taking a loss on selling your bitcoins from the original purchase price, I would expect this would be treated as a capital loss.

Just happened to me last week as well. This is my second bank account forced closed with the same exact type letter (Chase and now EverBank). I had just explained to them that a wire was bitcoin related as I trade bitcoin among other commodities. One week later I receive the letter. What I think is interesting is the procedure is exactly the same between these two unrelated banks (or three banks including yours). They send a letter saying the account is forced closed, then when you call them to talk about it they won't tell you why. It's almost like US banks have been told to close accounts of people using bitcoin, but to not actually disclose the reason (as there's no legal justification for it). I'm right there with you feeling the frustration.

The FED didn't always have the same tools available that it now has today. The tool set available to the FED today is quite larger than what was available 50+ years ago.

A central bank can expand or contract the supply of money through a couple of ways: changing interest rates and purchasing assets. After 2009 the Federal Reserve has been using both of these means to get the economy out of recession. They also provided liquidity during a time when normal banks wouldn't.
The benefits of these programs are obvious:
* Low interest rates lower the cost of obtaining capital for businesses and individuals.
* The purchase of assets increases the value of companies and personal wealth.
Both of these benefits contribute to spending increases in the greater economy which creates confidence and growth.
The biggest downside to this that I can see is quite large:
* The middle class and lower who take the brunt of a recession and are forced to sell their assets during such times are then left behind when the central bank starts to inflate.
This downside creates a large gap between the wealthy and everyone else. There are obvious ways to take advantage of this system and increase your wealth past a dwindling middle class once you understand how the game works. The trouble is when a recession starts, generally no one is expecting it, and that forces over leveraged people to sell their assets at a significant discount to those with greater wealth and easier access to credit.
So to answer the question of why the recessions have been reduced, it's simple: the FED's main job is to steer the economy out of recessions, so when they happen the FED steps in and gets to work using the tools available.
Personally I'm not a fan of central banks, yet I am realistic that they are here to stay. This creates a good argument that Bitcoin as a store of value is also here to stay.

I think you fail to see that both camps in the end care deeply about Bitcoin and want it to succeed. That's why there is so much emotion involved to the point that one side seemly hates the other lol. Roger clearly cares about Bitcoin.
Personally I have no real strong feeling on the matter as I imagine eventually one side will win out and Bitcoin will succeed.

Did you listen to him at all? Guy seems genuinely in love with the properties of Bitcoin and it's ability to change the world for the better. The hate around here for him is sad, because all he wants is the same thing you want: Bitcoin to succeed and not fail.

COMEX is a futures exchange. Bitcoin already has those. Not sure what you mean by fractional reserve, as COMEX is just a futures exchange, not a bank or store of gold.

I think the fact that Trump is the Republican candidate for US President shows quite a large number of people no longer trust their government. I'm not implying Trump is the best choice, but I think it does imply that people are starting to get fed up with career politicians. I think the reason the Banks are getting let off the hook is it seems to me people have disconnected Wall St (which they don't trust) with Banks, while not realizing they are very much the same post Glass-Steagall.

I think you missed the $ symbol. As in 32 million USD worth of coins.

Agreed. From $1100 to $2000 that's not even 100%. These alt coins are shooting up thousands of percent. Get to $10K and I'll get excited.

This got me laughing. Thanks

I can confirm and agree with this comment.

No you don't need to be licensed, you just need a certain size of capital. The point is to prevent the little guy from losing what they can't afford. Nanny state lol

I thought Brian Sullivan like Bitcoin. He talks about it all the time. I'm pretty sure he laughed simply because he was caught off guard to have someone else bring it up.

I think you might be surprised by how strong the human tendency is to repeat emotional driven mistakes. Especially when fear, greed, and loss aversion are involved.

You might want to ask yourself why something like 98% of all traders lose money? If people can simply change human nature like you suggest and become more mature then you'd think these traders would eventual start winning.
It's almost guaranteed when big holders start cashing out at a profit these mature users you refer to will start selling from loss aversion as well.
