Yet people continue to give their bitcoin to bank-like institutions in return for promises to pay it back.
The question is: why? This is the question that boosters calling for measures to promote "mass adoption" fail to even ask.
The answer is simple. Bitcoin is crazy hard to use as designed. People just don't get digital security or the idea of irreversible payments - to the extent that they obligingly hand over their money to organizations that can't possibly pay it back if something goes wrong. Over and over again.
What the latest episode is telling us is that "mass adoption" is light years away and may never happen. Until Joe Sixpack can properly secure his own bitcoin and actually sees the value in doing so, the only adoption will be by niche enthusiasts.

Most of this exchange relates to the claim made by Nicolas Courtois, who was apparently hired by GQ as cryptography expert (begins at 0:30):


AFAIK, this is false in the general case. There is no way other than brute force to derive an ECDSA private key from a signature alone if the private key is randomly selected. Given other important information, yes, but Courtois isn't speaking in that context. He seems to be spouting complete nonsense.
It looks like this is Courtois' Wikipedia page:

If true and if such a large payment is in fact made (both open questions), we can expect scrutiny around regulated exchanges like never before.
Large mining pools will also come under intense pressure to censor any transaction allowing the attacker to send or receive payment.
In other words, this would turn out to be the most rigorous test to date of Bitcoin's censorship resistance.

I understand how keeping utxo in memory would help performance, but is this really how Bitcoin Core does it by default?
The utxo set is north of 1GB:
So on face value it seems that keeping the entire set in memory isn't viable for some nodes at least. I've seen statements to the effect that either an index is held in memory, or some other arrangement short of full memory residency is used.
Where can I find something definitive on this?
Also, the post makes an economic argument that segwit encourages users to consume more outputs than they create. However, there is another factor that will tend to go in the opposite direction: privacy. If by consuming multiple outputs I leak privacy, then that's a cost I need to balance against the transaction fee.

I appreciate Tucker's work (his use of the phrase "rules without rulers" to describe the the Bitcoin ideal was insightful), but I don't find this explanation of Bitcoin to be especially useful. The signal to noise ratio is too low.
There is no up-front definition of the problem(s) that Bitcoin is supposed to solve. At 3:19, he suggests starting with a game of Telephone.
I would have started with the problem of digital scarcity. It's easy to do this by talking about physical currency. Everyone has used it and knows physical cash's useful properties and security issues.
Tucker doesn't get there until 9:50. From there, it's much easier to expand the talk into law and government. But until the audience realizes that a solution to the digital scarcity problem exists and how that works, digital law won't make much sense.

I think what you're doing is excellent and very much needed - keep up the good work!
My critique is mainly aimed at avoiding a recurring problem: the tension between decentralization and usability.
The Bitcoin community has a long history of choosing centralized solutions and then getting burned by that choice - badly. MtGox is the canonical example, but there have been a constellation of others.
You even cite one of them in your response on another thread: Hive abandoned its wallet, leaving your integration with it in doubt. My point is that Bitcoin, in principle, make reliance on centralized operators unnecessary. However, I'd be the first to point out that much work is still needed to deliver on this promise.

The Crash Landing post makes this falsifiable claim - as transaction volume overflows block capacity, nodes will fail, setting up a vicious cycle:
















Although this did appear to happen in isolated cases, those were the exceptions rather than the rule. Electrum servers seemed to be especially vulnerable to high memory pool use for some reason. But that's something for the Electrum team to fix.


That's a valid hypothesis, but I'm not sure it's testable. AFAIK, there is no way to determine the number of active Bitcoin users.
Merchant adoption does appear to be slowing, as evidenced by problems at BitPay and postings to But that can also be explained by the practical difficulty of buying, selling, and holding onto bitcoin, not to mention a slowdown in the mass media hype cycle, serious unaddressed problems that merchants face running two different revenue streams, and generally low use after the adoption announcement is made. All of these problems predate the block size controversy.

That goes back to the idea of electronic cash on which Bitcoin is based. This is the step that many people skip, but it turns out to be the key to actually understanding Bitcoin.
In a nutshell, an unspent output is an electronic token that works a lot like a paper banknote or metal coin. For example, even if you're buying a $1.99 pack of gum, you still need to hand the cashier the entire $20 bill if you have nothing smaller.
More here:
Regarding the second question, I'm not quite sure I understand.
Part of the block is the coinbase transaction, which pays the miner. If Miner A finds proof-of-work for Miner B's block, MinerA can't spend the block reward because only Miner B can unlock it.
So each miners solves their own block, and the one with the most hash power wins the most rewards over time.

Peter Thiel has repeatedly made the case that the purpose of startups is to create monopolies. The purpose of investors is to help startups do that. In fact, competition is for losers:
Many VCs agree with him. The problem being that monopolies are bad for Bitcoin. A monopoly provides a chokepoint. And if recent history teaches us nothing, it's that no bully can resist a chokepoint. Even if you move your business to Panama or Switzerland, the long arm of the US legal system and its fixation on drugs and terrorism will find you.
ChangeTip was a monopoly of sorts. It's not hard to imagine that if the company actually provided a service where profits flowed more freely, that it could have become a major chokepoint in the Bitcoin economy. FISA orders. Large-scale thefts. MtGox-style meltdowns. The possibilities are endless.


That's an interesting idea, but I've seen nothing to suggest that the company is profitable, much less obscenely so. It seems more likely that like other pure play Bitcoin companies, BitGo is struggling.
It's not clear how significant money will be made with Bitcoin, other than trading the currency itself. In fact, knowledgeable people have suggested to me that the only viable investment model is to plunk down money in bitcoin itself, then fund a deliberately profitless company that will build vital, decentralized infrastructure.
For many investors, that's a bridge too far. Either way, the stereotypical VC model of funding a startup, then exiting by its sale, doesn't seem to work with Bitcoin. In that sense, there may be no place for VCs at the Bitcoin table.

Consensus in Bitcoin is a term used to describe the aggregate policy nodes use to identify the active chain. Everything else is politics. The network currently ignores &gt;1MB blocks, so the OP statement can't be true.
The word "consensus" gets bandied about a lot as a way to manipulate a political process. Over time, the tactic loses its effectiveness as the disparity between words (what miners and node operators say they will do) and actions (the software node operators actually use) becomes clear.

I'm not sure whether the irony is intentional. "Guardians of the code" amounts to centralization.

If gambling isn't legal in your jurisdiction, you most certainly *do not* want to involve your credit card.
All Bitcoin transactions are public. Buying with a credit card creates a link between the card and your specific transactions, kept forever, on the block chain, which anyone can peruse at their leisure - now or in the future.
To answer your question, yes, you can buy and sell bitcoin for local currency. That's done through an exchange, of which there are many, each offering varying degrees of convenience/privacy/security tradeoffs.

They don't. Each coin exists as an unspent transaction output on the block chain. Each transaction input references one transaction output. This creates a "chain of ownership" allowing any owner of an unspent output to trace the history of his/her coin. An output that isn't linked to an input of any other transaction is "unspent" and can later be spent.


You can direct any number of payments to an address. Each time you receive a payment, a new unspent output will be associated with the address. It's a bit like putting multiple lumps of gold into the same theft-proof transparent box. To spend, you have to pull out intact gold lumps, but once taken out of the box a lump can be melted down and re-cast into any number of new lumps.
In a very loose sense, address = transparent box and unspent output = gold lump.


You're asking for a "liquid" model of cash, which is how bank accounts and credit cards work.
Bitcoin uses a "solid" model of cash, which is how physical cash works. You could create a cryptocurrency that uses the liquid model (and AFAICT, this is how Ethereum works), but it would need to use a different underlying mechanism to establish authenticity of payments.


You're missing the part about the coinbase transaction. This is a payment to a miner with no sender. There is exactly one in a block, and it will be different for every miner. The coinbase transaction means that every miner works on a different block, and as a result must generate a different, independent proof-of-work.

That's a tax advantage, but there are other advantages that might also matter. I'm not sure your 20-30% figure fully accounts for these. Consider the choice between buying GBTC with your current broker (retirement account or otherwise) vs. buying and holding through Coinbase:
- you already have an account with your current broker - there's nothing to figure out
- no angst/confusion about delays in funding your account
- your current broker has been around for longer than 3 years and is based in New York, not Silcon Valley
- your IRA has more money in it than your checking account
- there's no way your Board of Directors would approve of a Coinbase account, but there's a chance they'd be Ok with a small investment in GBTC - even if it does come at a premium
It seems quite likely that the perceived fair premium for GBTC will reflect market sentiment. If expectation is for higher USD/BTC exchange rate, the spread should increase to reflect that.
The fair market spread is a question that may be answerable give the data that are now available and will be in the future.

That sounds like very high bitcoin transaction volume. Could you put this into context by giving an idea of the total average number of sales you make in a day?
Alternatively, if 250 transaction *is* how many you do on an average day, how many is a handful of bitcoin transactions that you ended up making? In other words, about what percentage of your total transactions were bitcoin payments?
Also, how did you let people know your business accepted bitcoin? What materials, if any, did you have on hand to free yourself from having to explain the same things repeatedly?

Those calling for a block size limit increase (and the hard fork that must entail) repeatedly made the claim that the network was in immediate danger of falling apart ("Crash Landing"  and that the reward for fixing the problem more than offset the downside of potentially splitting the network.
We now have the data, and they don't support the basic premise on which the last agonizing 18 months was based.
After more than a half dozen attempts to flood the network with garbage in a futile attempt to prove the block size limit is too low ("stress tests"), Bitcoin abides. It worked exactly as designed, the attackers lost money, and wallet developers are waking up to the idea that fixed fees are a bug, not a feature.
Despite repeated claims that raising the block size limit was the Will of the Users, no hard fork update has been deployed.
Making a case for change and vigorously pushing for it are both commendable.
But failing to face facts that refute your original hypothesis can only be self-destructive to yourself and those who trusted you. It's time for those advocating a block size increase to re-evaluate their original premise given the new facts that have emerged.

That's the main reason I believe Ethereum will ultimately fall to the wayside. The team appears to want it both ways: a strong central steering committee *and* exemption from the scrutiny that other financial service providers face. Setting up shop in Switzerland won't help these folks if/when Ethereum begins to see significant use on the black market. They've painted a rather large bullseye on themselves.
Some view Ethereum's top-down governance model as a feature. In time, however, I suspect that it will come to be seen as a bug.
For these reasons, the idea that the optimal governance model comes down to forking makes a lot of sense. The ride will be quite bumpy, though. Bitcoin Classic is probably just the beginning.

The main problem I see regarding producers is unlocking their payments after receiving them. The BIP-32 family of specifications may seem completely resolved, but wallet implementations often don't implement the full hierarchy, which means that payments could potentially become "lost" if the payment gateway derives its keypairs in a way that's incompatible with the producer's wallet.

LN is a network for fast payments. Segwit is a technology that eliminates transaction malleability. Malleability makes LN less useful by making it more difficult to create the channels used by LN.
(Actually, segwit does something even more useful: it allows unsigned transactions to be chained together. When they are signed, the chain remains intact. This is useful for many kinds of Bitcoin "smart contracts." Without segwit a chain of unsigned transactions breaks when they are signed.)
So, segwit is an enabling technology for LN.

This was your first of many mistakes. You never owned your bitcoin. You gave it to Binance in exchange for a promise to give it back to you through a security protocol. You didn't take the security protocol seriously, and this is what happened. However, you could have easily lost your money due to theft or fraud at Binance.
If you own bitcoin, you have no need for banks such as Binance. You also are 100% responsible for the security of your money.

Think in terms of a single node (Alice). Alice knows of a block *b1* at height *h*. Alice receives a sibling block *b2* also at *h* from her peer, Bob. Both blocks claim *a1* as parent.
    a1
       `-b1
       |
       `-b2
Alice continues to identify the chain ending in *b1* as active even though she was given *b2* and both represent the same amount of proof-of-work.
Next, Alice receives block *c1* from Bob. This block builds on *b2*. Alice changes her active chain designation so that it now includes *b2*. This causes *b1* to become "extinct" from Alice's perspective (not orphaned, because it does have a parent).
    a1
       `-b1
       |
       `-b2-c1
However, all of this happens from Alice's perspective. A non-peer, Tom, may identify a different active chain.

A node knows to designate a chain as extinct when it receives a block or blocks that form a stronger (more proof of work) chain.

When you say "real money" you're actually taking part in a shared delusion. That that delusion is that money exists at all. It does, but only in your mind (and the minds of those you transact with).
That euro you hold has value because other people say it does. Your ability to access it requires the permission of your government. It's ability to hold value exists only as long as the illusion can be maintained.
The less secure the delusion, the more the value will fluctuate. When the value stops fluctuating, the gains to be made from currency speculation will disappear.

When you own bitcoin, you control the ability to move one or more digital tokens having specific face values. Bitcoin is an electronic cash system, meaning that users exchange digital tokens. They don't debit amounts back and forth. More here:


That is not how Bitcoin works. The "object" is an electronic token. I have seen presentations claiming there are no coins in Bitcoin. This statement is not true and confuses beginners as they start to learn what's really going on underneath the wallet.


The wallet holds private keys and runs software for using them. You can separate the two functionalities with a paper wallet, but you will need to bring them back together when spending.


It's antithetical to privacy, freedom, and fungibility.


Sell goods or services for bitcoin.


You wallet should manage this for you.


You'll pay a transaction fee for every transaction, regardless of whether the intended payee is yourself or someone else.


You're thinking of a seed (aka master private key, or mnemonic sentence). It's a secret from which multiple private keys are derived. It turns out you can derive all the public keys without revealing the seed. This is useful for checking balances, and for cold storage.

For something more specific, you're going to need to understand how Bitcoin works. Here's a start:
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:21:38
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:54:55


Yes. Bitcoin Core nodes will evict an unconfirmed transaction after ~~3~~ 2 weeks by default. In practice a transaction can remain unconfirmed even longer if it gets rebroadcast.


It's not in-between wallets. Until you receive confirmation, the payment doesn't use the block chain security model at all.


That's not an accurate picture of what's going on. Unconfirmed transactions are outside the scope of the Bitcoin protocol. It may look like money is in limbo when a tx is unconfirmed, but it is not - at least from the perspective of nodes. Ownership only changes with a confirmed transaction.
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:47:06


To understand the answer, you'll need to understand some things about private keys first:
Short answer is that your private key is mathematically linked to your public key. You'll get the same public key every time you generate it from the private key. 


A paper wallet is just a piece of paper bearing a private key.
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:38:35
In general, yes. Every transaction must be kept to fully validate the block chain.
Bitcoin security depends on at least some nodes being capable of serving every transaction. An individual user can take advantage of optimizations such as pruning.
If security requirements are not strict and the risks are understood, SPV becomes an option. This kind of wallet uses mainly block headers, which grow at the rate of 4.2 MB/year.

The problem with this question is that your idea of cheap may not match someone else's idea of cheap. I've very recently seen statements to the effect that even at $50 a pop, Bitcoin transactions are an incredible deal.
The truth is that nobody knows how this will shake out. LN is amazing technology, but has problems that will need to be overcome.

The language under "Technical Details" is hard to follow and in places gramatically incorrect. Here's my attempt to restate - I'm probably getting a lot of this wrong. Corrections welcome:


- PR (merged 2011) added a check for duplicate (double-spent) inputs in `CTransaction::CheckTransaction()` 
- PR (0.14) disabled the "duplicatable duplicate-input check" 
- 0.14 retained the check for double-spent inputs, but only as a sanity check. This appears to be a reference to the use of `assert` which when it fails causes the Bitcoin Core process to exit. See: 


The above supports the idea that PR exposes Bitcoin nodes to a forced exit through assert.


No PR on this one, but it sounds like the assertion (forced exit/crash) condition was relaxed to simply check that the output being spent by an input exists.


That last sentence wasn't mentioned in any of the earlier discussion I saw. In other words, **a sufficiently knowledgeable miner (or someone submitting transactions through the miner) could have (and still could try to) double spent an output on chain**.
Releases after and including 0.15, excluding 0.16.3, performed a double spending check for outputs created within a block, but not for outputs created outside of it.

Bitcoin doesn't use encryption. It does, however, use two pieces of cryptographic technology:
1. digital signatures (
2. hash functions (
Should either of these become vulnerable in a sudden way, it would be a catastrophe because computer security as we know it would become impossible. The proviso being that Bitcoin uses a very particular form of digital signatures not widely used outside of cryptocurrency.
Both digital signatures and hash functions are based on a very simple idea: a mathematical operation can be easy in one direction but infeasible in the opposite direction. It's very hard to prove the latter point, and that's the risk that all systems based on cryptography face.

The value overflow incident happened when Bitcoin was less than one year old.
Transaction volume was a tenth or 100th of what it is today. The rollback was painless because so few transactions were affected and the value of bitcoin was barely measurable.
A similar rollback today would be another beast altogether. A more apt comparison to "rolling back" would be the hard fork in the aftermath of the DAO incident.

Bottom line: if you actually did restore from seed, your money is safe (although the transaction may take weeks to clear). The address may have changed because of how Bitcoin works.
Confusing to be sure. I'm not quite clear what the issue is, but be sure to check all of your addresses in Electrum (View -&gt; Show Addresses). In 3.x, there's a widget near the top that's easy to miss labeled "Filter." Check both Receiving and Change to convince yourself that your money is safe.

One way would be Coinbin:
To spend, enter your private key on the top line, the address you're sending to on the "address" line and the amount on the "amount" line.
Be aware that doing so on a network connected computer is a major security risk. Don't use this method for large amounts. A better way would be to practice spending from some paper wallets, which you can generate from bitaddress:
In other words, if you're storing a lot of money on that card, get a few bits onto a new paper wallet and practice moving funds around with Coinbin. When you've got the idea down pat, you'll probably be ready to learn about cold storage.

Full nodes relay transactions, and this change would affect them as well. 
If I'm reading this right, then a zero-fee transaction wouldn't get "stuck" - it would simply fail to reach very many nodes - if any. Eliminating the priority queue means that nodes running Core with default settings will reject zero-fee transactions and not relay them.
In effect, a zero-fee transaction would become similar to a nonstandard transaction. It can be mined if given directly to a miner, but is unlikely to be mined or propagated otherwise.
One positive outcome of this change is that it vastly simplifies how fees work. No fee means little to no propagation and very low chance of confirmation.
The main disadvantage is that the priority queue offered a narrow channel through which transactions could flow freely during spam attacks. Shutting down the priority queue means closing off this channel.

Short answer: it's complicated.
Long answer (and one of the best explanations I've found out there):
Edit: in a nutshell:
    Qi = M + h(i:M)*G
    Qi = m*G + h(i:M)*G
    m*G = Qi - h(i:M)*G
    m*G = di*G - h(i:M)*G
and finally:
    m = di - h(i:M)
where Qi and di are child public and private keys, respectively, and M, m are master public and private keys, respectively. h is a hash function such as SHA-256. G is the generator point.
All of the above math relies on the properties of elliptic curve point addition/multiplication, which support commutative and distributive properties as with real numbers:
The attack consists of grinding on the first equation (the attacker can derive Qi from di) to find an offset value i that works. With i in hand, the last equation can be used to find m.
Imagine that the second character, i, of Qi and di is subscripted (can't seem to do that with the markdown we have here).

Jawboning works for soft forks because mining has become so centralized. Without that centralization, even soft forks might become impractical. A hard fork is a very different beast, but it's being treated as if it were "just" a soft fork.
Nobody really knows what happens when a hard fork update is adopted by a large percentage of the network.

Imagine Bob is a "printer" who takes BIP 38-encrypted private keys and turns them into commemorative coins.
You create your BIP 38-encrypted private key using bitaddress.org. The key begins with "6". You give it to Bob and he prints the coin, then gives it to you. Bob can't steal your money because he doesn't know the passphrase you used to secure the private key.
There's another way this works, called "EC multiply mode". Here you give Bob an "intermediate code". Bob uses it to print the coin, and can give you cryptographic proof that the private key matches the address.
Either way, Bob can't steal you coins unless you use an exceptionally weak passphrase.

The block size controversy won't make sense unless you understand the difference between soft forks (which are common) and hard forks (which are for all intents and purposes unprecedented).
A hard fork effectively creates a new alt coin by making blocks valid that were previously invalid. The big blocks proposal will create a new alt coin. More here:
A soft fork restricts already valid behavior. It can be implemented merely by convincing the operators of a handful of pools to stop doing something they were already doing. A voting system of the kind you propose has already been implemented and used. This is how we got P2SH ("multisig") addresses:
Hard forks are naturally divisive because every single node operator, exchange, holder, and miner must choose whether to support the new alt coin or not. Miner voting won't solve this problem because they're only one constituency of many.

Nodes are sufficiently diverse in their mempool policies as it stands that double spending zeroconf transactions is feasible - without the need for RBF.

Here's a tutorial that shows how to do it with a web browser:

You should not be creating multi-input transactions without reviewing them in the first place, regardless of whether small-valued coins have been sent to an address.
However, most mobile wallets will do just that by default - effectively destroying much of the hard work of using HD wallets in the first place. In the rush to make Bitcoin "user friendly", financial privacy has been an unfortunate casualty.
Coin control is a powerful privacy tool that puts users in charge of whether or not coins will be linked together. Unfortunately, coin control isn't a feature of mobile wallets.
You can, however, find coin control - to varying degrees - in these wallets:
- Bitcoin Core (advanced settings)
- Armory
- Electrum
Regarding the mysterious dust transactions, I believe they're not privacy attacks. Anyone can see chains of ownership being linked through multi-input transactions on the block chain. There's no need to fire a tracer.
Instead, these transactions are intended as an ill-advised privacy defense. "Taint analysis", as it's unfortunately called, will give the illusion of better privacy if coins are widely distributed.

Bitcoin Core makes a pool of 100 key pairs. When you use one by accepting a payment or making change, a new key pair (address) is added to the pool. If one of those new addresses becomes used (because you've consumed over 100 key pairs), then your backup will be invalidated. More here:
To answer your question - no, you don't necessarily need to make a new backup immediately. However, eventually your backup will become invalid and Bitcoin Core won't do anything to inform you that this has happened. So you'll need to essentially make backups all the time, or keep very close watch on your key pair use. Neither are good solutions. A better option is to use a deterministic key pool wallet such as Armory (which runs atop Bitcoin Core), or Electrum (which requires no block chain download).

Venture capitalists like Peter Thiel believe the mission of a startup is to create a monopoly.
Bitcoin makes it possible to do away with the middle man. This disintermediation capability seems to be spreading to neighboring sectors:
- Open Bazaar has many of the features of an eBay-style marketplace.
- Streamium lets people directly share video for payment.
- Coinffeine is an exchange without an overseer.
- JoyStream lets people share their storage/bandwidth for bitcoin.
In every case, there is no central operator, and therefore no clear path to creating a monopoly. It's not even obvious whether the groups backing these efforts can turn them into businesses in the traditional sense.
Given the apparently irreconcilable goals of Thiel's style of venture capital with many of the most innovative projects in Bitcoin, does venture capital even have a role to play? If so, what is it?

Regardless of whether you've opened port 8333 or not, you are running a fully validating node. It just doesn't relay blocks or transactions if port 8333 is closed. You have the longest chain given to you by the peers you can see on the P2P network, and the complete set of transactions that goes with it.
The main difference between a full node and SPV node is that the latter doesn't get any transactions to start with (although it does start with a complete, valid chain of headers). To calculate balances and create transactions, it needs to request a subset of confirmed transactions from peers. The model is inherently weaker than the one used by a full node.

A couple of things to note.
First, the chain with the most work "lost" through direct intervention. It was initially clear that the 0.8 chain would win because it had the most work. Then that idea became untenable. Whether or not a rollback will be an option this time around is an open question.
Second, most users had no idea any of this was happening. As evidence this is likely to happen again, consider how much of the debate has sidestepped the issue that this is a hard fork update and that this is essentially unprecedented.
Third, there was one incident of a successful double spend ($10K against OKPay). It's not just a theoretical possibility. The only defense will be to run both nodes. Many miners may opt to dedicate a part of their hash rate to *both* chains, as a hedge.

That's a soft fork. It restricts what's acceptable. It can be deployed without requiring non-generating nodes to apply the patch.
When Satoshi introduced the block size limit, it was a soft fork for the same reason.

Increasing the block size is a hard fork because it makes blocks valid that weren't valid before.

To expand 's answer a bit, there are not two different kinds of addresses in this context - just one.
There are, however, two different kinds of transactions (or more precisely, challenge scripts).
The first, and oldest, kind of script will unlock a coin for anyone who can provide a signature matching a pre-specified public key. This is a "pay-to-public-key" (P2PK) script. Almost nobody uses such scripts anymore, but they are still accepted by the network.
The second kind of transaction will unlock a coin for anyone who can provide a signature matching the pre-specified *hash value* of a public key. In other words, the script doesn't specify a public key, but rather the hash value of a public key. This is a "pay-to-public-key-hash" (P2PKH) script. One way to represent the hash is with a traditional address (a string of characters beginning with "1").
The hash value is a bit more complicated than it might seem. It's computed by first taking the SHA-256 hash value of the public key, and then taking the RIPEMD-160 hash value of the resulting hash value. It's a double-hash value.
Reversing the process to arrive at the original public key is not something that has been theoretically demonstrated with quantum computers. So although a quantum computer *might* be able to derive a private key from a public key, deriving a public key from an address would, as far as anybody has made public, be an insurmountable challenge.
When you lock coins using the standard P2PKH script, your *public* key remains secret. (Notice that this is separate from the idea that your *private* key remains secret. That's always the case unless you') Only when you spend from a P2PKH address does your public key get published. This is the basis for the sometimes-given advice that not re-using addresses can help keep you safe from quantum attacks. IMO, this fear is exaggerated, but the principle is valid. There's a much better reason to dispose of a key pair after a single use - privacy.
There's more here:

There's another way to look at this that hasn't received much attention, from what I can tell.
Making money as a pure-play Bitcoin company is going to be very difficult for a long time. This new technology kicks the middleman to the curb, and spreads that disintermediation capability to other areas of commerce (for example, eBay without eBay, aka Open Bazaar). As it stood, it was hard to see how charging exactly $0 to merchants was going to get BitPay very far.
Investors, however, want to make money by funding the next gatekeeper. Ideally, one that creates a strong monopoly.
The difference between what Bitcoin enables and what most investors want is stark. If so, there will be a lot of wreckage along the way. Investors will try to drive companies toward models that have worked in the past, leading to ruination. BitPay may be among the corpses, as the OP title suggests, but many other high-fliers will join it.

It may be true that Satoshi intended for this change to take place. Nevertheless, the hard fork needed to implement this plan in effect creates a new, backward-incompatible coin. This behavior under a hard fork update was itself baked into the protocol from the beginning.


I don't think so. I'm not saying this path is inevitable. Most would agree there is a big difference between the two constants. Today. But it's not hard to imagine that this could change in the future.
The real problem here is the political process needed to implement a hard fork. That process is highly corruptible, which seems to fly in the face of Bitcoin's central value proposition: rules without rulers.

An attacker can only gain access to funds by discovering the private key to which they're locked. A breech of Coinbase after transfer won't allow an attacker to steal your funds directly.


That's an entirely different matter. Coinbase hasn't said exactly what they do with withdrawal addresses. However, it's safe to assume that every withdrawal you make is logged and meticulously recorded, including your IP address, and the withdrawal address. You should consider that information under the permanent control of Coinbase. You'll never get it back, and you'll never get Coinbase to delete it.
So although you're (mostly) safe from the perspective of private key security, you're very vulnerable from the perspective of privacy.
I say "mostly" because privacy leaks can easily lead to security issues.

+1 for civil discussion, if for no other reason than to raise the signal-to-noise ratio.
Let's step back a few paces.
As I understand it, this sub's moderation policy discourages altcoin discussions.
I disagree with this policy and would rather let the community downvote the junk into oblivion. Then again, the vermin altcoins attract seem to drown out the useful research going on in that space by orders of magnitude. So clearly a line must be drawn somewhere.
The best definition I've been able to find for the term "altcoin" is: "a cryptocurrency based on Bitcoin, but incompatible with it."
Hard forks of any kind, whether they raise the block size limit or raise the 21 M cap on circulation, would seem to fall squarely into my working definition of "altcoin."
From what I can tell, the current policy of moderating out XT discussions is quite consistent with the more general policy on altcoins.
So if you want to change the policy to allow discussions of hard fork implementations, one way to do that would be to persuade the right people to loosen the policy on altcoin discussions on this sub.

The block size limit discussion has sucked a lot of the oxygen out of the room when it comes to the far bigger issue: mining centralization.
It wasn't too long ago that pools dominated the mining landscape. This offered a margin of safety in that members who disagreed with pool policies could leave - in principle.
But Today, multiple large operations stand on their own. These integrated miners have a more centralizing effect in that the power to make decision lies within a single organization.
Extrapolating this trend into the next two years doesn't look pretty, especially given the reduction in the subsidy next year and the pressure this may put on marginally profitable operations.

Interesting to compare the bitcoin production schedule (rigid and declining) with gold's (price-sensitive and flexible).
I'd add one more point to consider: negative interest rates.
The world's central banks have entered uncharted territory on this one. When and how does it end? Nobody knows.
One thing is certain. An early criticism of Bitcoin as an investment vehicle was that it payed no interest (also a criticism of gold). With fiat cash increasingly "paying" negative interest, and signs that the cost will be passed on to depositors, that argument no longer applies. On the contrary, this strengthens the appeal of bitcoin.
There may be good reasons to stay away from Bitcoin as a store of wealth, but lack of an interest payment is definitely not one of them.

If anything, this illustrates the dangers of an improperly-incentivized network. There's very little that can be done to Antminer short of asking them to play nice.
Imagine the same thing were to happen on Mainnet. Maybe the miner is trying to signal users that the time has come to pay up for network security. Maybe some small, but exploitable advantage has been found in relaying one-transaction blocks. The competitive pressures on miners will only increase next year with the halving of the block subsidy.
Whatever cap is set on the block size, miners have 100% control over which valid, standard transactions they draw from the memory pool.
Bigger blocks is no guarantee that they will be filled.

You can download and compile Gavin's patch at any time. Or write your own. Then you can set up your own big blocks node. You can even set up a cluster of nodes. Nothing prevents you from doing this, except maybe the mistaken belief that you can't.
However, you should realize that if you were to do so and relied on your node to process important payments, that you could very well be forked off the network by an attacker and lose money.
The same applies to anyone who made a unilateral hard fork protocol change.
That's the real reason big blocks haven't been implemented yet.

The problem with hard forks is that they force every node to deploy or risk being forked off the network. I'm not sure the big blocks proposal would have met with nearly the opposition it has if it could be implemented as a simple, easy to understand soft fork.

Malleability is a problem for many kinds of "contracts", including payment channels such as Lightning network.
The starting point for most contracts is a temporary deposit. This is created with two transactions:
1. One that locks funds in a way that requires both parties' signatures to spend ("client" and "server").
2. One that pays the refund back to depositor ("client") after a certain amount of time.
The second transaction references the first through its transaction ID. If the ID of transaction  can be changed through malleability, then the refund transaction becomes invalid. If this happens, the "server" can hold the deposit hostage, refusing to refund any unspent balance.

The author has just described a *soft fork*, not the hard fork an increase in block size imposes. This may not seem like an important distinction, but it lies at the heart of why the big blocks proposal is so divisive.
Hard forks are very, very uncommon. In fact, there's only one incident in Bitcoin's entire history that even comes close to a hard fork update. It was a rather boring update that added a checksum as a security fix. It was only deployed after it was determined that no network nodes would be adversely affected.
Mining the first big block splits the network into two groups: patched nodes and unpatched nodes. Patched nodes accept big or small blocks, but unpatched nodes only accept small blocks. As patched nodes grow their side of the fork, unpatched nodes reject every one of its blocks. If the unpatched nodes grow their chain more slowly, the patched side of the network will reject all of its blocks because the other side of the fork has more proof-of-work.
The same coin can be spent on either fork. Otherwise known as double spending, this is the very thing the network was designed to prevent. This is not merely a theoretical possibility. It happended during the 2013 accidental chain split event (which was not a hard fork update, and was not in the least contentious):
There's a highly questionable assumption that this split would resolve itself quickly. It can instead persist for a very long time - possibly for the foreseeable future. Making no decision puts you on the unpatched side of the network.
There's another highly questionable assumption that the patched nodes will eventually "win" in the sense that the unpatched side of the network will wither away eventually. During the 2013 chain split incident, it was the fork with the most proof-of-work that disappeared.
Miner consensus leading up to the hard fork update means nothing here. Miners can switch at will between either chain, guided by profit potential, good-intentions, or malice. Developer consensus is also largely irrelevant. They can switch sides as well, or leave altogether. Whatever the outcome, node operators will run the software they want to run. To the extent that exchanges like Shapeshift support coins on both forks, then trading between the two cryptocurrencies will be possible.
Given the uncertainties, it would not be surprising to see miners mining both sides as a hedge. Users may hedge their bets as well. Merchants would need to run both types of nodes to detect double spending. All of these things would increase the time during which both cryptocurrencies co-exist.
A hard fork update is, simply put, unprecedented. To miss this point is to miss the crux of the debate.

The block chain, as used in Bitcoin, is mutable by design:
@_date: 2015-06-02 23:59:48
Interesting proposal. After a quick read, here are some thoughts/questions.
The block size cap is currently a brick wall on transaction volume. When volume exceeds the cap, transactions start to pile up in the memory pool. Given high enough volume, nodes will fail in unpredictable ways.
As the recent impromptu stress test show, it's not exactly hard to push the network toward this state. This will be true regardless of whether the cap is 1 MB or 20 MB.
This proposal replaces the brick wall with a two-part feedback mechanism:
1. Miners pay a penalty into a new "rollover fee pool" for generating blocks that approach the limit. A nonlinear scale acts as a cushion, allowing miners to make tradeoffs between collecting fees by adding more transactions and paying the penalty.
2. An elastic cap that can grow during times of high volume. Users can push for a higher block cap indirectly by increasing the fees they pay. These fees compensate the miner for paying the penalty for increasing the block size.
This proposal isn't exactly simple, but it seems to solve many problems that have been discussed. For example, a malicious node stuffing blocks with fake transactions will have to pay a penalty that cuts into the block reward. Serious offenders can lose the entire block subsidy. Users can dynamically raise the cap by paying higher fees, allowing miners to offset losses from the penalty. Assuming the cap works in both directions, block size limits will return to normal after a volume spike subsides.
Assuming I've understood correctly, one thing wasn't quite clear: how is the payout from the rollover fee pool made? Using the approach described here?
If so, is there any scenario where the rollover pool would start to back up?
Also, it seems that any change to this system (for example, to tweak a constant) would require a hard fork update. Would there be any way to avoid this, or would we be stuck with whatever constants were originally devised?

The question is: do you want to be receiving coins that may have already been spent on the "other" chain?


Maybe, but I suspect that if a fork persisted long enough for wallet vendors to take action, Bitcoin would be done for. It's confusing enough as it is. Throw in the Joker of a persistent split chain, and I can't see how nontechnical users will be able to navigate the resulting petri dish of double-spending scams.

Unfortunately, cold storage is not easy and involves many tradeoffs between security and usability. Electrum hits a pretty good middle ground, but you'll need to understand what you're doing or face bungling your way to a loss.
The plan I suggest is:
1. Learn what exactly cold storage is and why it's used.
2. Allocate pocket change to practicing, over and over, cold storage technique.
3. Propose your cold storage technique to someone who knows what they're talking about for review.
4. Fix any holes in your plan that don't represent good tradeoffs.
5. Practice, over and over, your cold storage technique.
6. Only after you've thoroughly researched and practiced your cold storage technique should you commit your savings to it.

The SPV node installs a filter on its peer, and the peer filters any transactions that don't match. As proof of membership for the transactions that do pass through, the peer provides the Merkle path.


A Merkle tree is simply a tamper-evident way to store a list of values. In this case, the list of values (terminal elements) is the transaction set for the block.

That's not my understanding. Full nodes will reject big blocks unless they're updated. Unpatched nodes will effectively be forked off the network.
This is why a hard fork update is different. More here:
@_date: 2015-06-01 15:16:03
Undesirable or not, the difference has important practical consequences that so far have not been addressed by either you or Gavin. Most of the discussion has revolved around block sizes, not the unique nature of this proposed update and, more importantly, the things that can go wrong.
It may be helpful for one of you to take the time to explain why these concerns are overblown. I've never seen a solid technical response explaining, in detail, the steps that will be taken to ensure all goes smoothly. I wrote Gavin about this, but he has so far not responded publicly or privately with details.
Here's the main practical difference:
- A soft fork allows node operators to update or not and still follow the consensus chain.
- A hard fork forces each operator to make a choice: join the new chain, or stay on the old one. Doing nothing is a vote for the old chain.
As evidence that node operators are a conservative bunch, I'd point to this chart:
During a chain split, double spending can (and will) occur. During the March 2013 chain fork incident, there was one published case of successful double spending. More incidents may occur given an extended chain fork. New attacks could be discovered and put to use.
By definition, this update *will* produce a chain split to some degree. Even if 70% of nodes have patched, that leaves 30% that haven't. Where this would lead is anybody's guess because it's never happened before. You can't simply band together on IRC and persuade the other 30% of nodes to update (or downgrade) to clear the fork. A 50-50 split would be even more unpredictable. And of course, there's the possibility that if the update goes very wrong, conservatism will win out and patched nodes will simply downgrade. Money is on the line, after all, and the threat to the network from overflowing blocks is not imminent.
The claim has been made that SPV nodes will be unaffected. However, those nodes need to get their block headers and transactions from somewhere. Connecting to a group of unpatched nodes, then later connecting to patched nodes could produce some very confusing results, if not outright loss of funds.
These are the points that, to my knowledge, remain unaddressed by the proponents of a hard fork update.

Nodes are already free to manipulate the memory pool in any way they choose. This move doesn't change anything about that.
The behavior of unconfirmed transactions is the composite result of how each node handles its own memory pool. Even the idea of "standard transactions" is just a suggestion.
F2Pool is simply manipulating its own memory pool for its own best interest. There's not a whole lot anyone else can do about it. Miners can leave, but if F2Pool becomes more profitable as a result of this change, those miners will be harming their own short-term economic interest.
It may appear that this move harms Bitcoin, but I suspect it will actually strengthen it. Instead of relying on an implicit, weak guarantee, those users wanting a robust solution to the coffee shop problem will have to create one.

As the link from says, the dust limit is 546 satoshis as of the latest major release of Bitcoin Core.
What this means is that transactions with outputs smaller than that amount will not be relayed by the network. Transactions with outputs between 546 satoshis and about 5500 satoshis will be partially relayed, because not all nodes have updated. This could affect confirmation time.
The dust limit is there to prevent "penny flooding" attacks. Imagine getting a withdrawal from the bank of $10,000 in pennies. Then, go to a convenience store and buy a bunch of stuff. Pay in pennies. Everywhere you go, pay in pennies. Lines will back up behind you and it will either just be funny if you're trolling, or it can help you rip the store off by creating a diversion. That's kind of an analogy of what penny flooding could do to the network.

One part of the thought experiment to consider:
A hard fork could motivate Bitcoin users themselves to attack the opposing network. A kind of digital civil war.

CoiledCoin comes to mind:
There, merged mining actually enabled the attack.
@_date: 2015-12-12 22:42:57


It's the other way around. You (Electrum) first generate a private key. From the private key you generate an address. You give the address to Coinbase, which signs a transaction that relocks one or more coins to the key pair represented by the address. A key pair is a combination of a private key and public key. A public key and address are easily generated from a private key. The opposite conversion is practically impossible.


Not quite. Let's say I want to steal funds from your Electrum wallet. The fact that I know you made a Coinbase withdrawal doesn't help me at all. Nor does knowing your address(es).
The problem I need to solve is how to obtain the private key(s) to which your funds are currently locked. Remember, obtaining a private key from an address is for all practical purposes impossible.
That said, there are a variety of ways for an attacker to discover the private keys your Electrum wallet holds. For example, you can inadvertently reveal your private keys. Or you could download malware that steals them. The list goes on and on. Preventing these attacks falls under the general heading of "security."

Even if you get a signed message, your supplier can move the funds at any time.
In fact, the address will probably change if the supplier uses the address for day to day payments. Address reuse is not advised for privacy reasons.
As an alternative, you can use a contract, specifically a proof-of-deposit:
Supplier gets the money back  guaranteed, but can't spend a satoshi until after a predetermined time. Likewise, you can't spend the funds, either. In effect, the supplier locks away a significant amount of money to prove to you they're solvent.
You can layer additional functionality (oracles, etc.) as well. Many possibilities.
However, none of this is satandard functionality in wallets yet. You'd be creating transactions manually using Bitcoin Core or some other low level tool.
@_date: 2015-06-24 04:43:33
The compromise you mention results from reusing addresses. So in addition to reduced privacy, address reuse can also result in an immediate security issue.
The answer is not to allow addresses to be revoked, which as points out would require a database of unbounded size. The answer is to never receive funds through the same address more than once.

Assuming you're posting this in the context of the block size increase discussion, here are some ideas.
If you haven't already, you might want to go back and read some other accounts of what happened in March 2013. For example:
A couple of things to note.
First, the chain with the most work "lost" through direct intervention. It's not inconceivable that the same could happen with an XT deployment.  Whether or not such a rollback will be an option this time around is an open question.
Second, users generally had no idea any of this was happening. As evidence this is likely to happen again, consider how much of the debate has sidestepped the issue that increasing the block size requires a hard fork update and that this is essentially unprecedented.
Third, real users lost real money during the incident. Two mining pools had their rewards confiscated for the greater good. There was one incident of a successful double spend ($10K against OKPay).
Fourth, for those worried that the hard fork update won't go smoothly, the only option is the run *both* nodes. In particular, miners will be very concerned about losing block reward due to an unanticipated rollback to Bitcoin Core (or better than expected uptake of XT). I would be surprised if at least some of them don't hedge by mining both block chains, at least for awhile. If enough of them do this, it could cause the very problem they're trying to avoid.

It's time for VCs to face the possibility that there's no place for them in Bitcoin.
VCs such as Peter Thiel crave monopolies because that's how the biggest returns and strongest businesses are created:
But monopolies, generally speaking, are harmful to Bitcoin. Monopolies provide a lever with which regulators, politicians, and scoundrels can interfere with Bitcoin's main value proposition - censorship-resistance.
It's not surprising that the highest flying Bitcoin companies are focused in those areas where creating a monopoly is feasible: exchanges; mining; and hardware. It's also not surprising that those are currently Bitcoin's most vulnerable choke points.
That said, there may be room for a different kind of VC - one with a clear vision of what Bitcoin is all about and who actively opposes the creation of monopolies. Such an investor would derive most, if not all, of their profit from increases to the exchange rate - not the profitability of the organizations being funded. Better utility of the overall network leads to wider adoption, which raises the exchange rate, boosting investor profits. Owning bitcoin would be like owning shares in a massive, decentralized organization. Alignment of incentives in this way makes a lot more sense.
This seems to be the de facto business model of many recently-funded organizations. It will be interesting if Bitcoin can bring about a change in the way VCs view startup funding itself.
But it's far from clear this strategy can work. One problem is that companies without paying customers of some kind fly blind. They have no idea if what they're doing is even worth the effort. So a critical readout - does the customer give a flip - is blank. A lot of stupid, counterproductive, and harmful ideas would likely get funded as a result.

From the BIP:
Protocol changes proposed:
1. Hard fork to remove 1MB block size limit.
2. Simultaneously, add a new soft fork limit of 2MB.
3. Schedule the hard fork on testnet for September 1, 2015.
4. Schedule the hard fork on bitcoin main chain for December 11, 2015.
5. Default miner block size becomes 1MB (easily changeable by miner at any time, as
6. Changing the 2MB limit is accomplished in a manner similar to BIP 34, a one­way lock­in upgrade with a 12,000 block (3 month) threshold.
This appears to be a hard fork update proposal, but with an eye to preventing future hard forks over the issue of block size through a soft fork update plan.
I like that BIP 100 proposes a specific timetable, and that it gets deployed on testnet first.
However, the exact sequence and nature of events isn't quite clear. Some questions that come to mind:
- How will the update itself be deployed? In latent form as has been hinted to in other discussions?
- What changes, if any, will be allowed to the latent code (if that's how it will be done) before activation?
- How will adoption of the latent update (if that's how it will be rolled out) be measured?
- What threshold of low uptake for the update, if any, would be sufficient to abort the plan?
- What weight will be given, if any, for generating node adoption vs. non-generating node support? How will these nodes be distinguished on the network?
Edit: Many of the questions that come to mind revolve around the tricky issue of updates creeping into the latent hard fork update. Marching in lock step to the deadline seems foolish. Maybe there's a fatal bug that only gets discovered late in the game. Another set of questions revolves around the criteria for aborting the mission. Even the most vocal proponents of a hard fork update must have some idea of what factors prior to activation would cause them to pull the update to retool it.

This is the part of the story that doesn't get the attention it deserves. A hard fork is uncharted territory. There's only one previous case that even comes close, and it consisted of an utterly boring bug fix that added a checksum a few years ago.
What Gavin is proposing does in fact amount to creating a new coin, incompatible with Bitcoin as we know it. Focusing exclusively on the technical rationale/feasibility of big blocks obscures the much more important issue of governance. This does a disservice to the community by framing the issue as a black and white case of whether to change a constant.
Keep in mind that the 21M money stock cap is also nothing more than a constant. The time may come when we are once again asked to change a constant for all the right reasons.
A hard fork will prove, once and for all, that no change to Bitcoin is impossible. It's a demonstration that those who believe in Bitcoin as the "best form of money" may come to regret.

Bitcoin is an "electronic cash system."
That statement is way more important than it might seem at first. It means that Bitcoin, like any other cash system, uses tokens to represent value. When you receive a payment, you're actually gaining control over one or more tokens.
Bitcoin's tokens are based on secure digital information and have no physical presence, which gives them some very useful properties over tokens like metal coins and paper banknotes.
The transaction you link to spends a bunch of tokens (aka "coins"), all of which happen to be controlled by the same public key. Those coins came from the "many small amounts" that were relocked to the paper wallet's public key.
Here's more:
A transaction actually spends one or more previously-received, unspent coins. The long list on the left of the page in your link represents all of the tokens that were redeemed to make the payment.
Each input adds the the "relay fee" you'll have to pay by increasing the length of the transaction in bytes. To minimize the fee, minimize the number of coins being redeemed.
It's not at all an intuitive way to structure fees, but that's how it works.

There are many reasons this debate has lasted so long and been so divisive.
Setting aside the question of how best to set the size of blocks, this would be a hard fork update. Nodes that don't update will effectively be using a different form of Bitcoin than those that did.
Unlike previous updates, every node operator would have to pick a side. Choosing the wrong side can cost those who depend on the node real money.
This kind of update has never happened in Bitcoin's history. The closest thing to it was an update in 2010 that changed the protocol in a very uncontroversial way.
An incomplete update with the big blocks proposal means that two networks will result, and that coins created prior to the split will be spendable on both. Loss of hash power on one branch leaves holders of coins created there with only one option: move to the other branch and lose money.
It may seem today like the winning branch will be obvious, but that would just be a guess. This kind of uncertainty would be harmful to the mass adoption most in Bitcoin want to see.
This may seem black-and-white, but if anything big blocks is the riskiest proposal that's ever been made. It deserves careful, reasoned consideration.
It also deserves a complete technical proposal to pick apart. So far there hasn't been one.
@_date: 2015-06-15 21:03:38
From one of the responses:


This mischaracterizes at least part of the opposition.
We're not talking about a soft fork, where jawboning a handful of large mining operators will get the job done.
Bitcoin makes hard fork updates - any hard fork update -  extremely difficult by design. The slow progress on the big blocks proposal simply shows the system works as intended.
The main backers of the big blocks proposal have, to my knowledge, never explicitly addressed the serious financial risks to users if the hard fork update goes off the rails.
Nor have proponents addressed the very delicate political issue of latently deploying an update to be activated at a predetermined future time. A bug in the implementation could be found in the meantime. Testing on testnet (as proposed in BIP 100) could uncover a fundamental, as yet unrecognized, security issue.
What is the abort plan if the facts change between the time the update is released and when it goes live? How will users be notified to roll back the deployment? What's the political process for changing the latent update code?
When I've raised these questions in the past, there have been no specific technical responses. As long as that continues, it's hard to see how a hard fork update can be considered wise.

It's important to know what you're trying to protect yourself against. It's also important to honestly evaluate how much a loss of your funds would affect you. Then scale your vigilance accordingly.
For the most part, you're trying to ensure that your decrypted private key does not end up in the hands of an attacker. That can occur through two main routes: (1) physical access to your computer; or (2) a network connection.
To protect against network-based attacks, you'll want to ensure that at no point can your private key be leaked. That begins with the generation of the key, which you've already done. If that was done insecurely, an attacker may already have your private key.
Here's a step-by-step procedure for working with paper wallets that shows one way to generate and use paper wallets with enhanced security:
That said, I don't recommend immediately using this procedure to secure large sums of money. You're going to need some practice to figure out how this all works. The best way to do that is forget about security for the time being and simply transfer trivial amounts of money back and forth among a few insecure paper wallets. Only after you thoroughly get it should you consider securing larger sums.
Now, to answer you question, no. Given an adequate attention to operational security, decrypting one BIP 38 paper wallet that was co-generated with others will not compromise their security.

It would be somewhat ironic if first mainstream killer apps came from the banking sector.
But if this is how things work out, it shouldn't be unexpected. Bitcoin is not at all easy to use privately and securely. Banks have been working on both problems for a while now (with varying degrees of success). They have the expertise for dealing with cryptographic material. They also have an interest in privacy to the extent that they want to control the financial information they reveal.

You can spend coins received prior to a hard fork on either fork. In fact, you can spend them on *both* forks if you want.
That sounds odd and it is odd. It's called double spending - the very problem the P2P network was designed to solve.
What you may not be able to do is spend coins received on one fork through the other fork.
Your wallet can only follow one fork at a time, so an attacker can give you a coin already spent on the other fork without any warning. If miners later abandon your fork, then you have no option but to go back to the other fork and lose your coin.
There may be steps that can be taken to minimize the risks of loss/confusion during this process, but so far the proposals on the table aren't detailed enough to know one way or the other.
@_date: 2015-06-24 21:09:15


I'm not sure I agree.
When users hear how "easy" Bitcoin is to use, they assume the kinks have been worked out - and behave accordingly - often to their regret.
These same users are shocked to find out that:
- Bitcoin Core takes hours to synchronize
- A web wallet operator can steal/freeze/lose your money
- As the sender of a payment, you're responsible for including a network fee. Nobody can tell you exactly how much this fee should be. It is possible to come up with a minimum, but to do so you need to calculate the length of the transaction, in bytes - before it's sent.
- Failure to attach a sufficient fee will place your money in limbo, where it will appear to be unspendable. There's nobody to call for help - you just have to wait it out (or use a command-line tool to attempt to dislodge the transaction).
- A crypto bug can allow an attacker to steal your money without physically accessing any of your computers
- Change addresses can cause you to throw your money into the digital void, from where it will never return
- An attacker can steal your money if you don't know how to store private keys
- Mess up with operational security, and all of your transactions can be trivially linked to your real-world identity
- The operator of an Electrum server can link all of your transactions together, tying them to your IP address
- A random node on the network can listen to your SPV node transactions and link all of your transactions together, even linking them to your IP address.
Successful technologies become invisible in the sense that few users know, or even care, how they work. But this status comes after years of iteration, failure, and even damage being done. In other words, blood, sweat, and tears.
Bitcoin isn't even close to being there yet. I'm optimistic that we will, but to say that understanding Bitcoin today is irrelevant is just setting new, non-technical users up for big problems.

I had never seen the comparison between "solid" and "liquid" money models before.
The idea that one or more coins get melted down, then re-cast during a transaction recently hit me when thinking visually about what exactly "taint" was measuring.
These are helpful ways of understanding what happens during a transaction. Has anything been about solid/liquid money metaphors?
On a related note, I believe Ethereum uses something closer to the liquid model.
@_date: 2015-12-11 21:30:19
In a word: fees. Assuming the outputs being spent were valid, an attacker would need to muster the funds to pay the fees to sustain the attack. Unlike the banking system, which charges fees based on the value being transferred, Bitcoin fees are charged by the byte. The more data a transaction consumes on the block chain, the higher the fee. This makes spam attacks expensive, but can't eliminate them completely.
Several such attacks have taken place in 2015. In every case, fees went up during the attack and then back down afterward. The attacks accomplished nothing in a technical sense long-term, although they factored into discussions on scalability going forward.

Maybe, but the evidence of flight into Bitcoin so far has been unconvincing.
That said, Greeks are now strongly discouraged from transacting in local currency. That's a huge problem - one that Bitcoin could actually solve.
The bootstrapping issue stands in the way, though. There is little cash to buy bitcoin in the first place. Ways around this include:
- Remittances. Western Union has shut down, leaving a vacuum that Bitcoin could easily fill.
- P2P loans. BTCJam and others.
If/when either of these two activities start to pick up, that would be a sign that a new chapter has begun. Until then, I doubt Bitcoin will play any role in Greece, although the capital flight effect on the dominoes next in line (Spain, Portugal, Italy, Ireland) could be significant.

No. I'm saying that a hard fork requires an unprecedented level of concerted effort among all participants in the Bitcoin economy.
The block size limit could be lowered through a soft fork (as was done several years ago), backed by a simple majority of mining hash power. So there's nothing special about the parameter itself. For that matter, the reward schedule could be shortened through a soft fork. There's nothing special about that parameter either, with respect to what would need to happen to lower it.
But going the other direction requires the active participation of far more parties, including exchanges, merchants, and individual users. Those who delegate their security to others (web wallet users) would follow whichever fork the provider followed, so the participation would be more tacit.
Whether the block size limit was intended as a temporary measure or not, the fact remains that hard forks are not just any old update. They're a different animal altogether. There's only been one, and that came after an existential crisis.
@_date: 2015-06-08 17:38:24
AFAIK, there have been no reported examples. Copay would be another wallet to try this on.
In principle, there's nothing special you'd be asking for. The wallet still needs to sign a partially-signed transaction. Whether this transaction was created with another program or not really shouldn't matter.
In practice, wallets don't simply move a raw transaction around. For various reasons, they tend to attach metadata to the transaction. If the metadata aren't present, then the signing could fail.
It's an interesting idea worth experimenting with, though.

Removing the block size limit altogether would itself require a hard fork update.


Good point. However, allowing this to become the new (implicit) limit could lead to the yet another hard fork down the road. That limit is there to protect the network from various denial-of-service attacks.


True. Proponents of lifting the block size limit as a way to lower fees need to realize that miners set the minimum block size. If they want, they can restrict blocks to one transaction (the coinbase) without penalty other than loss of fees, which are minuscule by comparison to the block reward.


Maybe so. The problem is that raising the limit, implicitly or explicitly, requires a hard fork.

Author makes some good points, but this one I do not agree with:


The memory pool, as it stands in Bitcoin Core, is a disaster waiting to happen. When it fills up, and available RAM fills up with pending transactions, the result is undefined. In other words, it's an obvious attack vector.
Regardless of which way the hard fork goes, the memory pool must be fixed to gracefully handle the condition of a growing backlog of transactions.

A safety deposit box won't protect you against a determined attacker. The attacker simply demands that you make a payment or [bad thing] happens.

There are two fundamentally different kinds of changes in Bitcoin: hard forks and soft forks.
A soft fork can be put into effect relatively easily by convincing the five or so top mining organizations to just do it. Centralization of mining gives us that. Each one of these changes narrows the definition of what Bitcoin is, and these soft forks to will likely continue.
A hard fork is a different beast altogether. Every single node on the network, whether it generates blocks or not, must take a side pro or contra. Those who pick the wrong side can lose money. That's a fundamental difference. The unprecedented nature of this kind of update could lead to some unpleasant technical surprises during the switchover. Hard fork proposals to this point have only minimally addressed this issue.
Regardless of one's opinions about mass adoption and the future role of Bitcoin, these technical facts still apply.

Szabo even misses Wright's main point, which is that Script doesn't currently have the capability for loops now, but could in the future. Whether that claim is believable isn't important. What is important is how Szabo responded, which was not technical in the slightest. If anything he's clearly trying to avoid a technical discussion.

Bob later spends some bitcoin. Bob's wallet naively sends the change for this transaction into the address generated by Eve. Eve has been listening for funds to enter this address and immediately steals them because she knows the private key.

Hmm, the cool thing about this is that unlike dice throws, the ordering of cards can be persisted. Just store the shuffled deck somewhere safe (and never use it).
Here's one simple way to do it:
Turn each card into a 6-bit number.  The first four bits represent the face value:
The last two bits represent the suit:
You create the 6-bit number by concatenating the suit onto the face value. For example, the ace of spades and 7 of diamonds would be:
000000, 011010
To get 260 bits you'll need to draw:
260/6 = 44.3, or 44 cards.
The first card goes in the least significant bit, and so on. For example, the sequence ace of spades/7 of diamonds would be:
Use the suit of the last card to assign the remaining two bits.
You could use this system with slight modifications to generate any number of bits.

The problem with sweeping a paper wallet into a Blockchain.info wallet is that it must be done on a network connected computer. Assuming the computer you're using is compromised means you have to assume your private key is now in the hands of an attacker.
You can minimize the effects of this by creating a new paper wallet with a new private key to hold the remainder.
It should be clear that the way in which a paper wallet is generated matters a lot as well. Here's one way to do it:
It's not paranoia, just a recognition of how easy it has been to create software exploits that steal Bitcoin.

You might want to think about what happens when you want to withdraw funds from the address on the aluminum card. It's easy to forget about this step.
The problem is that to spend you may need to bring the funds into a hot wallet of some kind. There are lots of ways to do this, but also lots of ways to lose money in the process.
It is possible to simply sign transactions with the private key on an offline computer, but that's non trivial to set up and get working right.
One workaround is to divide funds into various denominations. That spreads the risk. You might want to practice some options with a small amount of funds to get a feel for what works best.

For those who may not be familiar with them, ETFs are investments that trade like stocks. ETFs are set up in such a way to track the value of an underlying asset such as a stock index (list of stocks), or a commodity (such as gold or silver). When the underlying asset rises in value, the ETF price goes up. When the underlying asset falls in value, the EFT price goes down. There are other forms of ETF (short funds) that do the inverse. The EFT manager ensures the investment goal can be met by buying and selling the underlying asset. 
ETFs can be traded both through small investors in retirement accounts and by larger investors. If you want to hold bitcoin in your IRA, this would be a very convenient way to do it.
For an example of the kind of effect that the introduction of an EFT can have on an underlying asset, consider [Gold ETFs]( Since their introduction [about ten years ago]( these funds have become major holders of physical gold. It's thought that they played a key role in both the rise and fall of gold prices.
Should it be approved, this EFT could exercise a lot of influence over Bitcoin. There are two reasons:
- It will provide a smooth path for dollars to flow from investors of all kinds into Bitcoin.
- It will legitimize Bitcoin in the eyes of government officials and large investors

As says, the transaction fee is mainly a quick-and-dirty spam-prevention measure.
Fees are based on the amount of data sent, not the amount of money:
Manually setting the fee is not recommended because you typically don't have enough information to do it correctly. If the fee is too low, your transaction can be "stuck" or dropped altogether.

That's how I understood it, but what would happen to shareholder's ability to trade shares among themselves? What would be the process for a company to migrate its shares to another provider?
Edit: I think what I'm getting at is that it seems that Colored Coins only adds to the blockchain a pointer to an external resource. My understanding is that the resource is managed by Coinprism in the form of a URL. So if the URL can longer define the added meaning of the blockchain output, where does this leave owners of the asset defined by the colored coin?
It feels like I'm missing something explaining why Colored Coins doesn't force Coinprism and any other provider to become a centralized, trusted authority.
I'm probably missing something important, would be happy to get that cleared up.

The entire premise of Bitcoin is quite non-intuitive. It's one of those things that works in practice, but not theory.
Bitcoin is controlled by nobody and everybody at the same time. This idea has much wider implications than just money.

There's another side to technology adoption. The technology needs to give the user a new ability, or it must be significantly cheaper or easier to use.
Unfortunately, Bitcoin doesn't offer that yet to most people living in wealthy Western countries. Credit cards work great. They're universally accepted by online and brick/mortar businesses. If you lose one, get it replaced. If it gets stolen, the card company eats the loss.
If Bitcoin offered a major, useful new capability, people would bend over backwards to learn whatever was necessary.
This is why I think Bitcoin will take over many small niches before it ever can challenge the mainstream. The niches have problems that aren't solved by credit cards, checks, and wire transfers.
In other words, forget about the masses. Forget about your girlfriend (well, at least with respect to Bitcoin). Forget about Joe Sixpack. Find marginalized groups of users who have been complaining for years about being forced to use a crappy system that Bitcoin can replace, or who have gone without.
Simply making a technology easier to use will do little to attract users if those users aren't empowered to do anything they couldn't do already.

Hardware wallets like Trezor digitally sign transactions. In principle, you could pay a merchant in-person with a hardware wallet, but you must solve the problem of how to send the signed transaction.
QR Codes, NFC, and Bluetooth have all been proposed, and all have security and/or usability limitations. Trezor requires USB.
Li-Fi, on the other hand, could be both cheap and secure. Eavesdropping is much harder because communication only happens through a line-of sight. LED's are cheap, as are photodetectors.
Is there any reason a hardware wallet that supported sending Li-Fi transactions to a receiver wouldn't be secure, inexpensive, and easy-to-use?

Starbuck's does a risk analysis. They're selling you a coffee for a few thousand bits. If accepting a zero-confirmation payment, they're betting that the vast majority of customers won't try to double spend.
It's similar to the way that many merchants today accept zero-signature credit card payments. You could make a chargeback (and probably win). The difference is that your card company may want to re-issue the card, causing you inconvenience. That disincentive doesn't exist with Bitcoin.

Fees are way more confusing than they should be.
The *relay fee* is the fee that must be attached to a transaction for it to be relayed. It's set not by the value of the transaction, but the amount of data being published. As of 0.10.0, the relay fee is 1 satoshi per byte of data. Previously it was 10 satoshis per byte.
Confusingly, only a miner can collect the relay fee, not the node(s) that relay a given transaction. There is only one tx fee, but it's used in two different ways. First when deciding whether to relay, and second when a miner builds a candidate block.
Most wallets just punt on the issue and use a hard-coded fee to avoid confusing users. Having seen umteen dozen posts here about transactions being stuck for not paying a high enough fee, I can't fault the wallets.
In summary, to know the relay fee, you need the length of the transaction in bytes. Here's how to estimate it:

Confirmation occurs when a transaction enters the block chain for the first time. Each additional block built on top of the block with a transaction adds another confirmation. The more conformations a transaction has, the harder it is to remove the transaction from the block chain.
This may seem hard to follow. To really understand this business with blocks, transactions, and confirmations, there are two ideas to understand first:
- electronic cash
- double spending
Understanding these two things is what a lot of beginners (and event intermediate users) skip. Bitcoin seems very mysterious without these two concepts.

It's good to see more writing on this topic.
On a technical note, the Block Chain + peer-to-peer network seems more like a solution to the [Byzantine Generals Problem]( than the Two Generals Problem.
The Byzantine Generals Problem crops up whenever independent, mistrustful parties must work together to achieve some collective action.
The problem was originally framed in terms of a group of generals camped around an enemy city. The generals need to come up with a plan (retreat, attack, if attack - when?), but can't ever meet in person. The only means of communication is by messenger sent by foot from one camp to another. Further complicating matters, not every general can be trusted to be loyal to the cause.
The problem to be solved is:
- All loyal generals need to decide upon the same plan of action.
- A small number of traitorous generals cannot cause the loyal generals to adopt a bad plan.
How do the loyal generals agree on a plan of action?
A naive (and incorrect) solution would be to allow any general to send a proposal at any time to the other generals. One reason this fails is that by the time a proposal reaches a receiving general, he may have already sent his own plan to another general. There may be dozens of messengers in transit between camps at any one time - each with a different plan. Worse, there's no good way to distinguish messages from traitors and loyal generals.
This problem translates to Bitcoin if we imagine the generals as miners, the goal of the operation to be the construction of a valid block chain, and the means of communication to be blocks sent over a peer-to-peer network.
Satoshi's solution, as described in the white paper and in [an email](
- forces miners to wait an adjustable amount of time before broadcasting a new block
- makes it easy for honest miners to detect fraud, and nearly impossible for dishonest miners to forge transactions
- ensures that only one valid block sequence would ever recognized by honest miners as a group.

Although paper wallets are pretty easy to set up securely, spending from them securely is anything but easy. This is the part most miss when they advocate paper wallets.
The best method I've seen is to sweep with Mycelium:
However, there are at least two problems:
1. Change is returned to the paper wallet. This is bad for privacy and it's bad for security. All transactions flow through a single address, making it easy to link them together. Should the private key become compromised, you lose everything.
2. There's no good way to determine whether your Android has been infected with malware. Such malware could, for example, grab your private key, or alter the receiving or change addresses for the transaction before signing.
I used to think the answer was to create an offline signing tool to address this gap. However, manually managing private keys is not easy to do securely. There are too many moving parts. Getting privacy and security right is non-trivial.
An alternative is Electrum running in online/offline cold storage mode. The offline component can run from a Linux live boot disk such as Tails. Back up the seed mnemonic and be done with it. The system is easy to set up and maintain. It's more convenient and secure than paper wallets, but you have to look at the whole picture to realize it.

There are two main ways to get an external private key into a software wallet:
1. Add the private key to the software wallet's internal pool of private keys.
2. Move all bitcoin off the paper wallet and into an address in the software wallet's key pool with a transaction.
The fastest method is (1). The most secure method is (2). Unless you have a *very* good reason to do otherwise, sweeping is preferred over importing.
Unfortunately, none of the desktop software wallets support sweeping (Armory, Electrum, Hive, MultiBit, Qt/Core). So you have to do the work yourself. Here's how with MultiBit:

I think it was a bad idea to write this implemented BIP in the way it was:
1. Many people think that this *was* a joke instead of an actual soft fork to change the money supply that almost nobody in Bitcoin knows about.
2. No other BIP is written this way.
3. There was very little debate on BIP-42 at the time it was implemented. I've followed Bitcoin for years before this BIP was written and only found out about it months after it was a done deal.
4. The 21M supply cap is the one thing that everybody agrees makes Bitcoin Bitcoin. The spec for how it works comes by way of this ill-conceived document.
5. Bitcoin users take monetary policy *very* seriously, compounding the problem of those who think BIP-42 is just a joke, or that a Bilderberg-financed cabal is now running Bitcoin.
6. Overall, and taking the above into account, BIP-42 can give the impression of having been written as a joke to deflect interest and thereby avoid a rancorous community debate. Remember P2SH and OP_RETURN, which would have been fresh in the memory of those involved.

The best advice I can give is to forget about choosing a language and instead pick something you want to make. Then, choose the best language for that purpose.
Some languages are objectively better than others at specific tasks.
For example, if you want to build an iOS app, then Objective C is a must (or possibly Swift). If you want to do the same on Android, then it's Java. For client-side Web development, it's JavaScript. To work on Bitcoin Core, you really must understand C++.
First, pick your project, then pick the language to learn.
It is possible to shoehorn essentially any language into any project with cross-compilers, transpilers, runtimes, and the like. Having attempted that a few times, I can say the results have never been pretty.

Yes, signing a message proves that you know the private key that corresponds to the address to which funds were sent.
The generation process is:
private key -&gt; public key -&gt; address
More here:
Using the Electrum tool also verifies that the correct address is generated from the private key, because you need to indirectly refer to the private key via the address on the command line.
It may already be obvious, but you'll need to import the private key into Electrum to get this verification to work. In this sense, the method is clunky, because if you continue to use Electrum later, you'll want to be sure to remove the private key when you're done.

Bitcoin takes the issue of "managing" the money supply off the table entirely. In its place is predictable, well-known, schedule.
Given the state of the art in digital currencies, I don't see any other way to achieve the conflicting goals of currency introduction and store of value.
Doge's decision to infinitely grow the money supply is interesting and may end up working in one form or another. But correctly and automatically adjusting the rate of money growth in response to the health of a digital currency's economic activity is a long way off.
We can't even do that with economies that have been studied for decades.

You can set up Electrum to run in this mode. I don't recommend it (because you can deanonymize the parties you transact with as well), but the option exists.
It's under tools &gt; electrum preferences. Uncheck the box marked "use change addresses".
Alternatively, MultiBit works in single address mode by default. However, it has so many gotchas that I can't recommend it.
If you don't mind working with a web wallet, blockchain.info works with way as well.

There's practically no limit.
However, using one address leaks privacy. Anyone can use the block chain to see all your payments, your current balance and your revenues. If your identity becomes tied to the address, your financial history becomes an open book.
This is the problem solved by stealth addresses. A stealth address lets you publish a single stealth address, while collecting payments in multiple payment addresses.
Unfortunately, stealth addresses are supported by few wallets (Dark Wallet).

You're right. My point was to note that there's nothing technically preventing the loan of Bitcoin between consenting parties.

A bit is 100 satoshis. A satoshi is the smallest possible unit of value in bitcoin.
So you can write a bit as:
And know there will not be another place after the decimal (for a while at least).
A lot if accounting software won't display more than two places past the decimal, so expressing values in bits means these programs can use bitcoin values directly without modification.

Credit card companies charge fees based on the amount of money sent. Bitcoin charges fees based on the amount of data sent:
The number of coins (payments you previously received) used as payment and their age (number of confirmations) can both affect the fee you'll pay.
So the answer to (1) depends on the current state of your wallet.
To answer (2), yes, it is possible that making a test transaction can affect the fees you'll pay for the real transaction. If the test transaction happens to gather up a number of loose coins and returns a larger one as change, that can reduce the fee on the second transaction. Similarly, if you have to spend an old coin to make the test payment, it can eliminate your chance to qualify for a fee waiver in the second transaction.
If you're using a decent wallet, it should figure this all out for you. Alternatively, you can use the new "coin control" feature on bitcoin core, but that's more of an advanced feature.
@_date: 2014-11-17 19:53:21

I would never discourage anyone from mining. If mining appeals to you, then by all means, jump right in and do it. 
The beauty of Bitcoin is that it lays a foundation on which anyone can build - without permission. That said, expectations need to be calibrated properly.
I would change your original statement to:


There are reasons to mine that go beyond monetary gain. For example, mining is one way to get "hands-on" with the protocol in a way that's hard to replicate.
Thankfully, beginner-level introductions to Bitcoin are moving away from the mining-centric spiel of the past. For example, compare these two videos:
-  \[2011\]
-  \[2014\]
I think calling the process "mining" was a huge mistake. It places too much emphasis on the block reward, and not enough emphasis on what miners are actually *doing*. It might have worked as a hook in the early days when anyone could earn the reward, but today the term miner simply causes confusion.
For this reason, I refer to the role as *auditor*. Now, who wants to jump in and start auditing?

The part about governance should be carefully considered. The suggestion has been made that what Bitcoin needs is a benevolent dictator. Someone who can get things done.
That model may work for other kinds of software, but Bitcoin is a different beast altogether. Assuming it would even be possible for one person to produce technically sound code without meaningful peer review, there's the issue of coercion, extortion, and worse. When software directly controls money, things change.
The longer this debate continues, the clearer it becomes why Satoshi may have left. He saw what was coming.

Yes. However, the attacker would be under a couple of constraints:
- The address must be valid. Bitcoin addresses have a built-in checksum. Simply changing one character is likely to result in an invalid address:
- The user, merchant, or both would become suspicious the very first time this happened. User would place an order with, say Overstock, and Overstock would say they didn't get the payment. User would check Tx history and find a transaction. Overstock would say it's not their address. User would post question to Other users would confirm. Eventually the malware would be tracked down, exposed, and dissected. The perp might even be unmasked in the process.

To sign a transaction, MultiBit needs to be able to find an unspent output to use. So if you receive a payment today, you won't be able to use it in a future payment if your wallet is behind.
The real problem is that you're not doing much to improve your security. If your wallet has a lot of money, consider using cold storage:
It can be implemented with paper wallets:
One strategy would be to create several paper wallets in various denominations, then sweep on into MultiBit when you want to spend:
It's cumbersome. A better way might be to use Electrum:

Imagine using it as a kind of 2 factor authentication running on two different devices.

Satoshi defined the term "coin" very carefully in the whitepaper.
Many people don't realize that Bitcoin is an electronic cash system. It's not a payment system. It's not a credit system, or any other system. It's a cash system. The idea of cash runs very deep in Bitcoin.
In cash systems, people trade tokens with face value. In Bitcoin, these tokens are digital.
It seems like a minor point, but passing over this simple observation is the source of the vast majority of problems beginning and intermediate level user have in understanding Bitcoin.

- Transactions can be partially signed such that anyone can modify a part afterwards. One use is in assurance contracts.
- How much hashing power does the network actually need? Current subsidy system doesn't necessarily get us there.
- Proof of passport: passport as a kind of private key. Passport data not revealed on network. This is a theoretical method to implement the one person, one vote idea.

The case:
 p &lt;= q
- p = probability an honest node finds the next block
- q = probability the attacker [majority cartel] finds the next block
gives the attacker a probability of success (qz) of 1.
My reading of this is that the majority cartel can always make a longer chain than the rest of the network, given enough time.

If no private keys were imported into the wallet, and no new addresses were created, then yes, it should.
A backup simply copies private keys, not coins. The record of coins is stored on the block chain. If the keys don't change, the backup continues to be valid.

Ah right, now it makes sense.
When you make a new address, you need to create a new backup. Otherwise, when you restore, your wallet will be missing addresses made since the last backup and your total will look lower than expected (which is what you're seeing).
This is a serious problem with MultiBit that that next version is supposed to address.

I think I'm starting to understand what you're after. How's this?
Electrum and Armory both support offline signing. Create a withdrawal transaction online, sign it offline. It works great, but makes the seed a single point of attack.
What you'd like is for the withdrawal transaction to require a second signature. For example, you could pass the singly-signed transaction to your phone, sign it from there and broadcast.
An attacker getting my seed can't steal my funds because he lacks the ability to provide the second signature.
AFAIK, the closest thing to this is Armory's lockbox:
That's one way to do it, but something specifically designed to work with a phone might be more convenient.

The problem with cold storage is that many discussions dive right into the technology without first explaining why it's necessary.
Cold storage is about one thing: protecting private keys from theft and accidental loss.
Before doing cold storage, you'll want to understand private keys at a high level:
A basic understanding of private keys will make it easier to understand what cold storage is all about:
Knowing the basic principles of cold storage will make the need and practice of using paper wallets more clear:

Bitcoin security becomes a lot more understandable by considering the specific threats you face. The most important one is network-based attack: a thief robs you over the network.
You prevent a network-based attack by keeping your valuables (typically private keys) away from the network. That's the purpose of a hardware wallet. It holds private keys and is supposed to prevent any attempt to get them out through a network.
Your full node is necessarily connected to a network, so it's a poor choice to for private key storage. You can improve the security of your node wallet with offline signing AKA "cold storage."
Offline signing/cold storage may seem mysterious, but it can be understood by learning a few simple principles:

This question [gets asked a lot](
@_date: 2014-04-28 19:06:34
Good point, and you may be correct - mining power will ultimately become concentrated into the hands of a few large operations (or one). If this happens, the future of Bitcoin looks grim at best.
As long as mining equipment remains expensive to buy and inefficient power-wise, it favors those with deep pockets. But as startup and operational costs drop, it will encourage more players to get into the game. As ASIC suppliers flood the market with ever cheaper and more powerful products (as hardware producers always seem to), it will drive hardware prices down. That's not really happening in farming, where farmland has a fixed supply, farming itself is very labor-intensive, and government subsidies distort the market.
A recent trip to my local farmers market revealed many small farmers making it work anyway by finding a niche the big players can't exploit profitably. Hopefully, this will happen with Bitcoin mining.

Any time you expose a private key to a network connected device there's a chance it can be stolen.
So, yes to your question.

@_date: 2014-07-02 01:15:32
You're right. Armory wallets are just deterministic, not hierarchical. My mistake.
Given that, you might gain some security by spreading out funds over multiple wallets. It really depends on how confident you are in the physical security of the paper backup and the quality of your offline signing technique.
If the former is a concern, you might look into a "fragmented backup", which lets you split the seed over multiple crypographic (redundant) fragments that you can print out and keep at relatives' houses, etc.

I'm not sure I made my point clear.
A new user wants nothing to do with this technobabble. They won't know the first thing about how to do what you just suggested. They'll come here and ask the same question over and over, or just give up on bitcoin. They'll tell their friends bitcoin doesn't work. They'll be driven towards possibly insecure alternatives. Even if they aren't, they won't ever be running a full node, encouraging ever greater centralization.
If bootstrap.dat is a solution, then why isn't the option of using it given in Bitcoin-Qt?
The point is that in its default state, the Bitcoin-Qt client is simply unusable by a newcomer. It sounded like Ultraprune was a solution, yet nothing seems to have changed.

A very good question. I don't know for sure.


It doesn't have to, but it could offer no fee transactions as an incentive to keep merchants and consumers using the system. Mining fees today are more of a spam protection measure. With the ability to block spam using other means, fees could drop to zero, while the BMM collects 100% of the block reward.

I'd like better options for visualizing transactions and the chain of coin ownership.
For example, when someone pays me, I can trace the transaction history for the coin by manually stepping through blockchain.info. What I can't do is get a good overview. Yes, there is a tree chart, but it doesn't extend back further than the last transaction.
I'd like to see the full graph displayed, with all transactions back to the miner.
There are a few applications I can think of for this. I suspect many more would follow if the right tool were placed into people's hands.

As long as you've kept your private key(s) out of any emails, online backups, etc., they won't be available to an attacker, and so funds at the corresponding address can't be moved.
BIP 38 can encrypt a private key such that even if an attacker gets ahold of it, it's close to useless:

If sent from an address you fully control with the correct fee (typically 0.1 milibits), you should see the unconfirmed transaction within seconds. The fact you're sending to a paper wallet does not matter, and the protocol has no way to determine this.
Can you discuss in more detail how you sent the transaction? I suspect this is where the problem is.

I think it's in a category all by itself. That's what confuses so many people - they try to put it into the nearest category they're familiar with, and it doesn't work well.
Bitcoin is neither property nor an accounting system. It's electronic cash, just as Satoshi described it in the whitepaper. To make this work, Satoshi discovered a way to create digital scarcity.
It turns out that purely electronic cash can be made to represent much more than just tokens with face value.
That's where many of the most exciting developments will be coming from.

Here's a way to do it with paper wallets:
The problem isn't so much getting the funds onto the paper wallet, but in generating the wallet securely and then later spending the funds securely.
That last point is often overlooked. At some point you will want to spend without exposing your key to the network. The tools exist, but are not well developed. The article gives some ideas, but now is the time to consider your options.

Chances are you've already sent multiple-address transactions without knowing it.
Every time you make a payment, your wallet decides which "coins" to spend. If the value of the coins exceeds the requested amount, change is generated.
The change needs to be collected in a change address. This confuses many people. The change address is just an address that your wallet controls and which receives enough funds from the transaction to give an acceptable mining fee. Confusing maybe, but that's how it works.

One alternative would be Stratum, which falls somewhere between the two extremes you outlined. It's an overlay protocol whose API adds some features for wallets (and mining pools), and which requires a full node underneath:

The problem I have with most discussions on USB security is that it's really hard to understand how likely the average person is to encounter the threat of the various advanced forms of malware being reported. For example:
The iOS wallet Bither supports the use of QR codes as a communication medium between online and offline devices. The author has written a draft BIP for the process:
Another approach is the audio channel. Long, long ago the only way to send data remotely was through the phone lines with an audio signal. People used to store data on audio tape recorders as well.

You're right, my bad. But from what I can tell you actually have to take the picture. If the code can't be read, you need to take another picture... and so on.
Compare this to other wallet apps, where the software lets you keep moving the camera until the QR code is detected, then it gives you confirmation and exits the scanning function. This is in fact how the Blockchain.info iOS app works.
This may not sound like a big deal, but in a payment situation, fiddling with the phone to get the QR code to scan is not fun for buyer or seller.

It could depend on what you think success for Bitcoin looks like. If success looks like being able to pay for most of the goods and services you currently buy with Bitcoin, then merchant/consumer adoption matters a lot. If you consider success to be be doing this anywhere you travel, then it matters a lot.
If you view Bitcoin to be an underlying foundation for what will eventually support a consumer-driven payment system that can surpass Visa, then the issue doesn't matter much at all right now. However, knowing what makes the current system tick is still important to ensure that Bitcoin has what's needed to enable any possible Visa replacement.

Blockchain.info wallets are said to encrypt private keys on your local hard drive. By "logging in", you decrypt those keys. They are not sent over the network (and don't need to be).
One attack would be malware that logs keystrokes when logging into your wallet, then uses that information to decrypt your private keys.
A similar attack would be possible with an encrypted Bitcoin Qt wallet.

Paper wallets fail pretty badly in this department.
It's relatively easy to set up a secure paper wallet:
The problem is spending from a paper wallet. The best tool, Mycelium, returns change to the paper wallet. Some like the convenience of this feature, but it leaks privacy. The intended recipient of each and every payment you make is unambiguous:
For this reason, I'd suggest looking at Electrum as a cold storage solution. Here's part 1 of a 3 part series. The overall system described there can be simplified by using a Linux boot CD such as Tails.

Why does importing a private key take so long in the first place?
@_date: 2014-08-10 19:06:10
Each one of these points could be (and has been) a complete thread unto itself. Let's take the first one:


There are two time durations people deal with when using Bitcoin. The first is a *confirmation time*. This is the time it takes for a transaction to appear in the block chain for the first time. It's about 10 minutes on average.
There's also a broadcast time, which is the time it takes for the entire network to become aware of the transaction. That takes a few seconds at the most.
To recap, a transaction is broadcast to all nodes and takes a few seconds to fully propagate. It takes about 10 minutes to see the transaction appear in the block chain.
Bitcoin transactions are never fully confirmed. However, the probability of a transaction being popped out of the block chain decreases rapidly with each block that subsequently appears on top of the transaction's block. Satoshi thought this concept was so important that he dedicated the "calculations" part of the white paper to explaining it.
After six blocks, the risk of a transaction becoming unconfirmed is practically zero.
However, it's important to realize what a confirmation signals. The only thing a confirmation is good for is a guarantee against double spending. In many kinds of transactions, the risk of double spending is viewed as being so low that the additional guarantee of confirmation is unnecessary. For example, if your friend gives you a payment, you probably trust him or her not to double spend. The same applies for many merchants and restaurants.
Credit cards work on a different model. Transactions can become unconfirmed at any point in the future. The process is known as a "chargeback". It's initiated by the payer, and the credit card company uses it's own internal policies and procedures to adjudicate.
This is one of the reasons for the constant new user complaint about not being able to buy bitcoin with a credit card. Chargebacks are so easy to initiate and are so often decided on flimsy evidence in favor of the buyer that no bitcoin user can take the risk of accepting credit card as payment.

I believe you are correct. Transactions residing on an orphaned block must be returned to the memory pool:

The video poses this question:
The purpose of the block subsidy is to promote the *decentralized* auditing of financial transactions. What steps can be taken to improve Bitcoin's ability to deliver on that goal?
Mining pools are often cited as working against the goal of decentralization. Every 4 months or so the community blows up in rage over a pool approaching majority hash rate status.
Mining pools may or may not represent a threat to decentralization. The problem with pools is that their power base is very flimsy. Miners can join and leave at will in most cases. Should a pool operator go rogue, support would likely disappear out from under him rapidly.
Nevertheless, let's accept the premise that pooled mining is a problem to be fixed, and not a solution to a deeper problem.
We can reverse the trend toward pooled mining by either discouraging pooled mining or encouraging solo mining. So, why do miners join pools in the first place?
There are two reasons:
1. Managing the block chain and protocol incurs overhead. This responsibility is taken on in many cases by the pool operator, who can attract members through streamlined UIs and the like.
2. The block subsidy is all-or-nothing. Miners have bills to pay, and the only way to get the cash to do that is with a block reward. But there are no fractional block subsidies except through joining a pool.
If I were to try to bring greater decentralization to mining and I thought that pools were the problem, I would figure out how to make solo mining an order of magnitude more attractive than pooled mining. That might involve:
1. Making it very easy to get started and continue solo mining. Slick UIs. Easy setups. Set it and forget it.
2. Finding a way to break the block subsidy into smaller pieces that can be collected by providing a fractional proof-of-work.
Point (2) sounds a lot like what P2Pool is supposed to do. However, it seems there's more work to be done on (1).
The proof-of-work algorithm itself seems like a side-issue. The real problem is how to incentivize solo mining.

The only shred of direct evidence in Goodman's entire story was her conversation with Dorian in his driveway with the two police officers. These are the only quotes from Dorian himself:
- "I am no longer involved in that and I cannot discuss it."
- "It's been turned over to other people. They are in charge of it now. I no longer have any connection."
In the CBS interview, Goodman was asked whether Dorian was referring to the contract work he did under confidentiality agreement. Goodman's response was a flat 'no' with not one shred of evidence to back up her claim. Just a few seconds of silence.
Goodman could have, for example, produced some of the email messages she claims she received from Dorian while posing as a train enthusiast. This would at least give us the opportunity to compare this writing style with the style Satoshi used in his public communications.
Instead, not one word from these emails has been quoted in the story or afterwards. Why not?
Without evidence to support Goodman's version of the exchange, all we're left with is a man with an interesting background and the media chasing its own tail.

Your wallet should take care of managing change addresses for you. There's nothing for you to do.
Some wallets send change to the spending address and so use only one address. This makes the transaction seem more "intuitive", but at the cost of decreased privacy for the payer and those who transact with him.

@_date: 2014-10-27 16:15:54
All Bitcoin transactions are public by design.
That said, I can think of one way to fund a paper wallet *without* publishing the address. Make a P2SH address whose script simply checks for a single signature from the paper wallets public key.
AFAIK, you would have to make this transaction by hand because no wallet supports it.
@_date: 2014-06-23 21:24:15
Looks like a bug to me.
By default, the transaction fee is set to 0.00. Yet a transaction fee is applied anyway.
Before sending a transaction, you're given a popop to review the details.
I believe Bitcoin Core uses the published fee schedule, which is counterintuitive. Rather than charging based on the amount of money sent, the fee is based on the amount of data sent:
Receiving many small payments, then trying to make a payment that combines them, will lead to fees so high they could exceed the intended payment amount.

It pains me to say it, but if you own an amount of bitcoin that would cause you to become deeply depressed if lost, either sell it now and put the fiat into a real bank account, or take the time to learn how to do cold storage.

If the attack were somehow connected to the email, it's not clear how (or why). After all, why would a thief leave such a clue?
An attacker who had previously gained access to your localbitcoins account would only need to secretly lie in wait for a payment to be made to your receiving address. Then after confirmation, steal the funds.

It sounds like you're asking how to ensure that a paper wallet tool actually generates the correct address/private key pair. That's a good question.
In the worst case, the software could generate a valid address that doesn't actually match the private key. An unsuspecting person would then send their hard-earned bitcoin either into oblivion, or into the hands of an attacker running a paper wallet generating scam.
Unfortunately, I know of no convenient way to do this. The only (inconvenient) way is to import the private key into another (offline) wallet application and verify that the correct address is shown. To be completely sure, you'd need to do this with every paper wallet. Alternatively, you could spot-check.
A malicious author of a paper wallet generator would have many opportunities to try to cheat people. For example, QR codes might not match addresses/private keys. So both of these would need to be checked.
@_date: 2014-07-16 20:38:59
Have you seen this?
@_date: 2014-11-14 16:08:56
A paper wallet often has two different QR codes.
One QR code instructs payers on how to make payments (the "address"). The other QR code provides the authentication needed to redeem funds that have been paid (the "private key").
Any user who knows the address can make a payment. Any user who knows the private key can redeem funds.

For the BMM, the benefits would be substantial. Without competition, it would be free to tweak its operation for maximal efficiency and profit.
The monopoly could pass these cost savings on in the form of reduced (or no) transaction fees, at least until the block reward becomes small enough. There could be other advantages as well, such as eliminating the 51% attack as an issue. An open and unforgeable transaction ledger might appeal to some.
Startups could profit because instead of having to explain why nobody can take over Bitcoin, they can explain that Bitcoin is run by a well regulated and fully accountable company with large resources at its disposal to maintain the system and counter threats.
I'm not saying I think any of this would be a good idea. Rather, just noting that not everyone would be averse to the idea.

Actually, that's a special case.
A coinbase transaction is a special transaction that lets a miner claim a block subsidy plus transaction fees. The genesis block "chancellor on brink" message was in one of these coinbase transactions.
Spending transactions must reference a list of unspent outputs, but a coinbase transaction uses no previous unspent output. To keep the data structure of a coinbase transaction consistent with spending transacitons, the field is still present, though.
A miner can fill this field with arbitrary data. That's where the genesis block message comes from.

Task-focused guides could be useful. I've seen a few and some are pretty good.
The challenge comes when one of those tasks starts to intersect with one of Bitcoin's more difficult areas to understand and do effectively.
Take, for example, privacy. It's shocking that anyone would consider using Bitcoin for anything that could get them into trouble given how extraordinarily difficult it is to maintain privacy.
Another example: secure storage. By the time many users collect enough value in Bitcoin for it to matter, insecure habits have been entrenched.
Security and privacy turn out the be very necessary to understand and quite difficult to learn because you essentially need to grasp the entire system for either concept to make sense.
Even so, I think these problems will be addressed, most likely by products and services that do the right thing by default, anticipating and preventing mistakes.
In the meantime, education is all we've got.

You raise a good point. Funds can be lost due to not understanding cold storage just as they can be lost due to a security breech at Coinbase.
I can only answer your question with another question: who do you trust more to secure your funds - yourself or Coinbase?
For many, Coinbase will be the better choice. That doesn't mean Coinbase is a *good* choice, just the better of the two.
When thinking about security at Coinbase, it's important to realize there are multiple threats. Yes, an attacker could possibly make off with some private keys.
However, Coinbase could be compelled, by the government or by a system failure for example, to stop servicing your account. That's not a threat you face with cold storage.

That's correct. When building the block, a miner generates a special transaction (the "coinbase" transaction) that credits a miner-specified address with the block reward (currently 25 BTC). Here's a block with only the coinbase transaction:
Notice how the transaction has no inputs. The bitcoin is created from "nothing".


The job title "miner" is something of a misnomer. A better title would be "auditor". The job is to validate transactions, bundle them into blocks, and broadcast the new block. As compensation, the network issues a block reward every ~10 minutes.

Normally, the sequence of trading an asset is:
1. Buy it
2. Sell it
In this kind of trade, you hope the price rises by the time you execute Step 2. The increase in price is your profit.
In shorting, the sequence is reversed:
1. Sell it
2. Buy it
In this kind of trade, you hope the price falls when you execute Step 2. The decrease in price is your profit.
How do you sell something you haven't bought? You borrow it.
Here's how you might go about "shorting" Bitcoin:
1. Borrow some BTC
2. Sell the BTC for fiat
3. After the price decreases, buy back the BTC, and pay back the person you borrowed from in Step 1.
Should the price of BTC increase, you'll have a problem. Not only will you owe interest on the loan you took in Step (1), you'll have to buy back at a higher price, then turn around and give the BTC to your creditor.

Yes, a monopoly could come about in response to the threat posed by a misbehaving pool. Maybe even GHash.IO itself. Good-guy strongman steps in and restores order - temporarily of course.
But even without a pretext, crisis to resolve, or extra tools, a BMM would still be a temptation for any capitalist worth his/her salt. The holy grail of many businesses seems to be the control a huge market with no competitors. Bitcoin block rewards seems like a worthy prize.
I keep bringing this up because so far the high-profile discussions of what a majority cartel could do give the impression that it's all much ado about nothing. That leads to a false sense of security if I'm right.

The standard answer to this question is "it's very, very, very unlikely".
However, that's only true if your private keys are made with a good random number generator (rng).
A wallet using a bad rng can in fact create collisions with other user's private keys. If that happens, both users share control over funds. Not good.
Likewise, a crook can spot a bad rng in a wallet and build software to deliberately create a private key collision. For example, take the case of Alternatively, many thefts have occurred through brain wallets, in which the user picks their own private key:

I suspect that the loudest calls to increase the supply cap could come from users and merchants, not miners.
A robust alternative method to funding network security must come forward soon - probably within the next four years. Transaction fees still remain the best chance for this happening.
A few successful majority hash rate attacks would offer plenty of ammunition for that segment of the Bitcoin user community who views the supply cap as expendable in the face of deteriorating security.
Maybe this won't happen, and a smooth transition to an alternative funding model will develop. But if it doesn't, it won't be just miners demanding continued subsidies.

1. Reporter finds the record for a Satoshi Nakamoto in a database containing registration cards of naturalized U.S. citizens.
2. Reporter discovers the man has since changed his name to "Dorian Prentice Satoshi Nakamoto" and signs his name "Dorian S. Nakamoto".
3. Reporter finds this 64-year old man living in Southern California.
4. Reporter discovers that Dorian works on model trains as a hobby.
5. Reporter contacts company through which Dorian buys trains, asking for Dorian's email address.
6. Company sends reporter Dorian's email address.
7. Reporter strikes up an email conversation with Dorian about trains. Reporter asks about Dorian's professional background, but only gets evasive answers.
8. Dorian asks about reporter's background.
9. Reporter says she will tell him about her background by phone.
10. Dorian doesn't answer phone when reporter calls him, and does not return subsequent calls.
11. Two weeks later, reporter appears at the door of Dorian's home.
12. Dorian opens the door a crack, then shuts it. He then calls the police.
13. Two police officers arrive.
14. A meeting takes place in Dorian's driveway between the reporter, Dorian, and the two police officers.
15. Reporter explains she wants to ask Dorian some questions about Bitcoin. One officer acknowledges knowing about both Bitcoin and Satoshi Nakamoto.
16. Dorian says he's "no longer involved in that", adding "It's been turned over to other people. They are in charge of it now. I no longer have any connection."
17. Dorian refuses to answer further questions.
18. The police break up the meeting.
The story's background information suggests Dorian might have had the means and motive to create Bitcoin, but there's nothing directly pointing to Dorian as the creator of Bitcoin. Dorian's statements in his driveway could be interpreted in a number of different ways given the sequence of events and statements by relatives.

You've just stepped into one of the worst problems with Bitcoin. The "default wallet", Bitcoin Core, is not for beginners.
You'll probably want to use a different wallet instead. The problem is that you've already sent a payment to your Bitcoin Core wallet.
To recover your funds, you'll need to take a crash course in Bitcoin internals.
Your Core wallet contains private keys. You can move private keys from one wallet to another, although this is really bad practice and should only be used when nothing else will work. This might be one of those times, depending on how much money is at stake and how unwilling you might be to let Bitcoin Core continue syncing for the next several days.
You sent funds to an address (long sequence of text beginning with "1").
To get the private key for your address, get to the Core console (Help-&gt;Debug window).
Next, click on the "Console" tab. There is a text box at the bottom with a "&gt;" symbol and a blinking cursor.
Enter this into the box:


where &lt;address&gt; is your address.
From there, you have the private key (begins with "K" or "L", possibly "5"), which you can import into another wallet.
Elsewhere, you indicated you're using electrum. Here's how to "sweep" funds from your private key into Electrum:
Note that the article talks about a paper wallet, which is simply a private key printed on paper.

Bitcoin core is problematic when making backups. Most payments you make will return change. This change needs to be returned to your wallet. Bitcoin core pulls the address from a pool of unused addresses. If enough addresses are used, the old backup will become invalid.

Both predictions are correct. In the short term the price will be driven down given no other factors at play. In the long term, increased merchant adoption should act to increase the Bitcoin market cap as more consumers leave a little in their wallets just in case they need it.
The reason merchants cash out (especially those running low margin businesses like Overstock), is that they need to pay their suppliers in dollars.
Should we get to a point where the Overstocks of the world can pay their employees, contractors, suppliers, and service providers in Bitcoin, the need to convert to dollars would decrease, boosting the bitcoin market cap.
In the very long term, when those merchants now taking bitcoin can themselves buy the goods and services needed to maintain their businesses, there will be less demand to immediately cash out.
This long-term process could take many years to run its course and may not happen at all.
But in the next few months, it would not be surprising to see a significant drop in the bitcoin price driven by exactly the process you asked about.

I view Bitcoin-Qt as pretty much useless for this reason. It's said that the next major 0.9 release will [fix the problem]( Here's hoping it does.
If you're just starting out, don't use Bitcoin-Qt - it will break your heart.
I suggest buying a trivial amount of bitcoin with $5 cash from [localbitcoins]( using the "cash deposit" method. Then move the bitcoin into a web wallet you create on [blockchain.info]( When you've successfully made a backup, recovered it, and made a few transfers, you can start to worry about offline wallets and security.

They make it much easier for beginners to start using digital cash systems at the cost of slightly diluting the dollar value of Bitcoin and other altcoins.
Altcoins are also able to innovate at a higher rate because there's less money riding on the outcome, and fewer vested interests. Some of those innovations will no doubt find their way back to Bitcoin.
Overall, far more positives than negatives.

This might answer some questions. Please let me know if you're still unsure about anything:
The problem isn't so much creating a paper wallet and moving funds onto it (although doing it securely is another matter). The problem is how to spend from a paper wallet.
Unfortunately, the major wallets in use do not directly support the best-practice method for doing this (sweeping), resulting in untold losses of Bitcoin by beginners. Two exceptions are blockchain.info and Mycellium.
Be sure you understand change addresses going into this. One bitcoin is a tidy sum to most folks:
@_date: 2014-07-15 00:30:11


The term "wallet" is quite confusing and inconsistently used. A wallet manages a collection of addresses (actually private keys). The wallet generates the private keys, and from each private key, one address is created. More here:
The exception is a paper wallet, which just records a bare private key on a piece of paper.
For starting out, I'd recommend blockchain.info as a wallet. This will let you learn how transactions work, how to do backups. Fund this wallet with a few bucks worth of bitcoin.


One reason would be that you're using paper wallets to do cold storage and don't want to keep generating a new paper wallet to collect change.
Another reason could be to spread funds out to reduce risk or make it easier to redeem funds in the future.


One low hassle way to do it in the US is with localbitcoins using the cash deposit method. Pay at a bank teller with cash. It requires minimal personal info. No bank account and no seller meetup needed:

Ask the person why they think their bank deposits need FDIC insurance, and what they think it means. Ask the person why they don't simply store cash in their house and instead use a bank.
Then explain that Bitcoin is an electronic cash system. Unlike physical cash, you can safely store this electronic cash yourself, if you do it right.  The need for a bank disappears, and with it, bank insurance (and bank runs).
Old habits die hard, though. And Bitcoin has for its first few years not been especially easy to store securely (multisig wallets could change that). People have repeatedly had to re-learn the lesson that if you give your money to someone else (Mt. Gox, countless others), that someone has an incentive to steal it, or may simply be incompetent and lose it.

It looks like brainwallet.org still uses JavaScript's Math.random, which is known to be cryptographically insecure:
See the randomBytes function in  - reformatting a little:
    randomBytes: function (e) {
      for (var t=[]; e&gt;0; e--) {
        t.push(Math.floor(Math.random() * 256));
        return t;
      }
    }
It's up to the browser to decide how to implement Math.random. So it could be helpful to know the browser you used should someone want to follow up forensically.
This should be a wakeup call to anyone who relies on private keys generated though brainwallet.org or an insecure random number generator.
That said, how did you store your private keys? There are many ways they can fall into the wrong hands, both electronically and physically. Also, it's possible to leak information when spending. Did you by any chance spend from one or more wallets made the same way?
@_date: 2014-06-05 13:43:09
Not quite sure I follow, but you can continue to send funds to a paper wallet after it's created.
If you're asking about forwarding payments automatically from one address to another, I'm not aware of an off-the-shelf way to do that. It's probably easier just to update your mining payout address with your cold storage address.

Yes. However, no wallets I'm aware of supports adding arbitrary OP_RETURN data. You'd have to hand craft the tx yourself.
You might adapt the procedure being developed here:

If so, be aware that a private key will generate an address. So the only thing you need to keep track of is the private key.

That's what I understood as the main point of the advisory. However, the evidence presented seemed flimsy at best. Unless you can match every input with every output using a single mapping, isn't the reliability of any correlation suspect?
Also, CoinJoin Sudoku failed to complete the correlation on a simple Shared Coin transaction. Did I get that part right?


That's the part that has me confused. indicated that Blockchain.info *had* implemented CoinJoin better in the past, but that something had changed. It's far from clear what exactly the new problem is.
What if Blockchain.info changed its protocol to force each user to accept a fixed output size. For example, there would only be 10, 25, 50, and 100 mBTC output sizes. Users would have to wait until 3 or more counterparties joined in at the level they selected. The service could even offer something of a marketplace listing active solicitations at a particular value.
That's at least how I understand CoinJoin to work. Why wouldn't this change fix the problem?

One problem with private keys is that they can be stolen through network-based attacks. An offline computer addresses the risk by eliminating the network. Although an offline computer can be a dedicated machine, an alternative is to use a live Linux boot DVD or CD, such as the one offered by Tails:


In terms of preventing unauthorized access by an attacker with no information other than the block chain, your money is for most purposes just as safe as if you had used another receiving address.
Privacy is an important and often-overlooked component of security. By accepting payments to the same address, you irreversibly link them together on the block chain for all to see. Should your identity ever become linked to that address, then it becomes easier to de-anonymize inbound and outbound payments as well. This could attract the interest of parties who would otherwise not have been interested, which could in turn lead to security problems.
Regarding the use of Circle as a hot wallet. You might want to reconsider that. Circle is subject to the full brunt of US financial laws, which require them to monitor your account and keep copious records on every transaction. Assume that every aspect of your use of Circle is being fed to a database and regularly scrutinized.
Chase customers recently discovered that even banks can suffer security breeches. The same thing (or much worse) can't be ruled out at Circle.
One way to protect yourself is to move bitcoin from Circle to a hot wallet (or cold storage) running on your phone or computer.

Both SharedCoin and a mixer suffer from a similar limitation. The service can keep logs that can help to reveal your identity. If those logs are subpoenaed, then there goes your privacy.

Here's a video that gives an alternative method using Tails:
Tails has the advantage that explicitly wipes any trace of itself from memory after shutdown. Either way, I'd use a non-rewritable DVD or CD rather than a USB stick to boot.
One thing to keep in mind - your online wallet will need a complete block chain. Be prepared to download the whole thing (minimum one day, more likely a few), then wait for Armory to do its own thing after that (a few hours).
It's for this second point that I prefer Electrum, which also supports offline signing. But if I already had a block chain, Armory is quite good.

I've read the paper at least 30 times and still find new things in there.
It's easy to ignore the parts you don't understand and keep reading because the style is so informal. For example, the first dozen or so times I read the paper, I had no idea what an "electronic cash system" was. I thought I knew, which is actually worse than not knowing at all. That really limited my ability to understand core concepts like double spending, which is why Bitcoin exists in the first place.

This isn't the trajectory many new technologies take.
Often a new technology starts out being objectively *worse* in one or more respects. This keeps incumbents from entering and dominating.
No middle manager in his or her right mind wants to look like a fool for suggesting entry into a market where the profit potential and market size are minuscule, where the legitimate use cases haven't materialized, and where the state of the art looks like a toy.
That's Bitcoin right now.
What incumbents are bad at relating to is that a new technology can evolve much faster than expected.

The short answer is yes. The thing linking your identity to the purchase is Coinbase.
The Bitcoin whitepaper has a good discussion of Bitcoin's privacy model in Section 10:


Coinbase merges the privacy model of the traditional banking system (gatekeeper ensures privacy and works with law enforcement) with the privacy model of Bitcoin (transactions only linked to public keys). In other words, anyone you trade with and who collects private information about you can break Bitcoin's privacy model, and harm you. The more information that is collected about you, the more damage can be done to you.

Assuming Satoshi was a genius and that he wanted from the very beginning to remain pseudonymous, it seems plausible that he would have the skill and motive to engineer a plan on this scale. A plan that would plant an abundance of clues, all pointing in the wrong directions. A plan with an alternate path leading directly to himself, ending in a boobytrap that would permanently discredit the person outing him and eliminate himself as a candidate.
Not at all likely, but plausible - at least to me. When considered in light of Bitcoin's own style of privacy through pseudonymity, the idea has a certain symmetry.
The problem is that this explanation is almost impossible to disprove.

This is now the third proposal I've seen in the last two days to remove the incentive for small miners to pool resources.
Although these efforts are a step in the right direction, it seems that they try to solve the wrong problem.
Pools can form and disband quickly. As such even if an operator of a majority pool wants to go rogue and double spend or halt transaction processing, this tactic will only likely be used for hit and run purposes. As such the profit (and damage) potential can be contained somewhat.
The real problem is a centralized organization that directly controls all of its hash power. Should such an organization gain majority hash rate, it could turn this computational advantage into an overwhelming financial advantage by preventing other miners from getting *any* block rewards. From there, it could gain 100% of the network hash rate with little effort, becoming a monopoly that would be hard to dislodge:
Pools actually prevent this from happening by making such a takeover expensive. Remove the small operators' ability to turn a profit though pooling, and only big operations are left - the kind that want desperately to become monopolies.

Should you happen to have picked up malware that grabs keyboard input or grabs screenshots, and is resistant to periodic connectivity, then your funds will be at risk.
That's a lot of if's, but from what I can tell, that's your main risk.
One more thing - you didn't mention how you get funds out of cold storage. That's an often-overlooked part of the process. Any contact of your private keys with a network-connected computer opens a security hole. You can minimize the risk by not re-using your paper wallet after spending from it.

Not a good idea. Private keys should be generated on, and never leave, a secure offline environment. You say you deleted the wallet file. The problem is that this is an online computer, which may or may not have been compromised at the time you wrote the wallet files.

The time interval of ~10 minutes gives the blocks time to reach every node before the next block is found. Otherwise, the chain could be split - and stay split for an extended period of time.
A forked chain with neither branch longer than the other gives double spenders a window of opportunity. Each fork will accommodate a different version of a double spend transaction.
Your proposal in its current form would result in forking as more miners joined the network. Bitcoin was designed with the opposite goal in mind - for the block chain to become more stable as more participants joined.

Yes, and they could take it one step further: eliminate mining fees altogether. In their current form, mining fees are more of a spam prevention measure. They make up a tiny fraction of the total block payout, and the BMM would have far better tools at its disposal to prevent spam.


That's the part I'm not sure a lot of users and investors would see immediately. I'm mainly drawing at the relatively muted response to revelations about the NSA.


Yes, minimizing the need to use their own equipment to keep the system running would maximize profits. The hashrate could fall to a lower level and stay there. Subcontracting miners would not have much choice.


Agree. This could benefit users in some ways. For example, any flaw in the current implementation could be fixed very quickly after discovery. No public discussion or trying to convince miners to go along. The BMM would have significant cash flow to fund the further development of the protocol as a business, not a nonprofit foundation.


That's the part where I'm not so sure. Users would face a choice about what is more important:
- being able to easily trade bitcoin
- decentralization of mining
A move to altcoins (most of which have exactly the same potential for mining monopoly) or a fork of the blockchain would fragment bitcoins current users community. It's something we haven't had to deal with before, and it could be more than messy.

Blockchain wallets store private keys encrypted on your hard drive. Given youre description and assuming that you really didn't create a backup of any kind, there aren't many possibilities to consider.
Here are some options, but you may not like them:
1. Your email account has been compromised. The attacker logged in and requested a password reset on the blockchain.info wallet.
2. Your computer and/or network have been compromised. Perhaps a key logger picked up your password as you typed it. Maybe there's a physical security issue.
It's always hard to dig into these cases, because there are so many questions that need to be asked. However, if you really never made a backup of your blockchain wallet, and you really only ever logged in from your own computer, there aren't many options.

Pools provide a shaky foundation for carrying out exploits. Miners can join and leave at will. When the pool does bad things, every participant can decide whether they're for it or against, then vote with their rig.
So I'm not sure pools are the problem. The problem is a single organization that controls all of its hash power. Given a majority hash rate, it can launch an *economic* attack that will drive other miners off the network by denying them block rewards. Left unchecked, a slight majority can become a monopoly:
I'm unaware of any defense. The problem is that once it's installed itself, the monopoly is almost impossible to dislodge without destroying Bitcoin.
Pools stand in the way of a would-be monopoly by making the purchase of the necessary hash power expensive. For that and other reasons, I think we should encourage decentralized pools that give participants tools for monitoring what the pool is doing.

You'll want to look at HierarchicalKey.js. Examples are included in the test suite:
To derive new public keys, you'll only need to store the master public key on your server. This protects you from theft of funds in the event your server is broken into. Here's a good list of references to get started with HD wallets:


As others have noted, to do that you'll need to talk to the network directly or indirectly. There's a lot of 'assembly required'. One way is running a node yourself (recommended). Here's some sample code:

You're right, this is a potential problem.
Credit cards have built-in dispute mediation. That feature can be added back into Bitcoin using escrow services.
One way to implement this is through a 2 of 3 multisignature address. Instead of paying the merchant, you pay a 2 of 3 multisig address, which requires signatures from two of the three parties involved (the escrow agent, the customer, and the merchant). No one party can take the money. The consent of one other party is needed.
Both the merchant and the customer would need to trust the escrow agent to a degree. Things can get interesting when you think about automated escrow agents such as "oracles", and decentralized oracle networks:

Something similar happened to me multiple times with Multibit. I'm not sure what the problem was, but in one case resetting the block chain did not work.
I ended up exporting my private keys, wiping the installation completely, reinstalling, and importing the private keys. None of this was as easy as it should have been and is not advisable unless you know exactly what you're doing.
It's a shame. Multibit has a lot of potential. But this issue is a deal breaker for beginners and I can't recommend it to them.

Do you continue to contribute to the 401k?
If so, you might consider and alternative approach in which you divert your monthly/annual payment into Bitcoin.
There are three big problems with your plan as it stands:
1. Keeping $22K (less withdrawal/tax penalty) worth of Bitcoin safe will require a lot of research on your part. If you don't understand what cold storage is and why it's useful, you stand to lose it all to theft or a silly mistake.
2. As you mention, you'll pay a tax penalty in the year you pull the money out.
3. You'll lose the ability to roll that poorly-managed 401k over into an IRA where you'll be able to get better returns.
Diverting funds instead of pulling the plug on the 401k minimizes all 3 problems.

Is there any chance you imported a private key into MultiBit?
I ask because by default MultiBit starts with one address and sends change to it.
If you import a paper wallet, MultiBit will use that address for change.
If an attacker gets ahold of your paper wallet (for example by digging through your trash after you toss it), then s/he can steal your funds just as you described. It will look like a problem with MultiBit, but it's actually due to the simple reason that the attacker discovered one of your MultiBit wallet private keys. See:
The same outcome would result if, for example, you manually added an address to MultiBit, made an unencrypted backup to a cloud storage account, and that account were compromised.
@_date: 2014-04-22 14:57:50


One way would be with paper wallets:
The main advantage: the properties of paper are well understood. The devil you know, etc. BIP 38 adds another layer of security if you'd like. Shamir's Secret Sharing is also possible (as a way to avoid forgetting the BIP 38 password(s)).
A lost or malfunctioning USB drive wouldn't matter at all - just create a new one. Tails stores no permanent data anyway.
Paper is really just one medium. For example, you could do Shamir's with USB, CD-R, etc. to store keys.
Under this system, you're really doing key maintenance manually. A better solution might be a lightweight deterministic wallet. For example, Electrum could be pre-configured as part of the Tails distribution.
Trust in the security of the distribution would likely be a barrier, at least initially.

I'm not sure Bitcoin adoption will be such a linear progression.
It may be that adoption (buying, selling, but most importantly using Bitcoin) will take hold in multiple niche markets.

One risk is that blockchain.info goes offline, as it did recently for several days. In that case, you won't be able to access your funds.
Cold storage is about only relying on the [bitcoin] network itself for safekeeping. It might seem hard, but after mastering a few basic concepts, it makes a lot more sense:

Blockchain.info has indicated that the issue only applied to private key generation:


However, I've seen multiple assertions (for example the one by  on this thread) that the issue also applied the ephemeral key pair, whose private key is also known as the "k value". The k value is used to *sign* transactions and is distinct from the private key. Here's some background on that:
The k value must be randomly chosen, otherwise an attacker can much more quickly (and sometimes trivially) deduce the private key given two transactions signed with the same private key. For example:
BC.info encourages private key re-use. Besides being bad for privacy, this practice makes a weak ephemeral key pair especially dangerous.
Can anyone point me to a link showing that the k value in BC.info wallets was compromised as well as private key generation?

Those other payment systems don't confirm for weeks or months. Merchants can (and have) had the funds pulled long after the initial transaction through chargebacks. That's not feasible in most cases with Bitcoin. After 10 minutes, it's pretty much final.


We're starting to see merchants offer discounts for Bitcoin. It makes sense, because the customer is doing the merchant a favor by making a payment that can't be reversed after hitting the block chain. I suspect there could be rewards programs created that take advantage of Bitcoin's unique capabilities as well.

You raise good points. Andreas discusses 51% here:
The argument seems to be that that the expense doesn't justify the return. I have to say the argument he gives is not reassuring. The line that "we can solve it [risk of 51% attack] in a number of different ways." needs much more technical explanation. What are the ways, and how will they be deployed? Most importantly, why would any of these countermeasures matter to a cartel wielding 51% of the hashrate?
There are purely financial, rational motivations to gain a 51% share of hashate that don't get discussed much.
One motivation would be to monopolize block reward payouts. The rate of payout is roughly ~~18,000~~ 3600 BTC/day, or $~~10.8~~ 2.1 million/day, or $~~324~~ 64.8 million/month at current rates. Keeping 100% of that for yourself is an offer many would find tempting on purely business grounds.
A negative feedback loop could become established at this point. With no block reward to be had, miners could abandon Bitcoin en masse, raising the attacker's share of hashrate at no cost. If left unchecked the attacker's hashrate could end up far exceeding 51%.
There's another more destructive motivation, still rooted in profit motive. An attacker takes a massive short position in Bitcoin. The attack is executed, maybe double spending a few symbolic transactions to really turn up the panic index.
The price of Bitcoin crashes. Attacker covers short position, realizing large profit. Rinse and repeat.
A variant of this attack might be to take a long position in some altcoin viewed as a safe haven from 51% attack. When the expected migration from Bitcoin happens, sell that long position.
Maybe I'm missing something but so far when I've discussed these scenarios, I haven't heard a compelling counterargument.

It's actually a good question. When you "generate" a private key, a better way to think about it is the selection of a random number from an unimaginably large set. The address is derived from this random number (private key) through a complex but well-known set of math operations:
In a sense, the private key you pick always existed and always will exist.    There's no need to tell the network about a new address because the set of all valid addresses is already defined mathematically.

@_date: 2014-10-06 16:22:11
The main risk is to your privacy.
Bitcoin uses a privacy model called pseudonymity. This means that all transactions are publicly logged, but no real-world identities are used.
Circle and Coinbase use the traditional banking system's privacy model. This means that copious amounts of private information are collected on every customer, and every cent or satoshi of every transaction is logged and scrutinized. This information can be released to others, either through compulsion (e.g., subpoena) or incompetence (e.g., an attack).
These two systems are fundamentally incompatible with each other. The flow of money out of Circle/Coinbase can be followed through the block chain. Coinbase is an especially problematic case because it's a payment processor as well. This means it can associate payment addresses with specific merchants. Coinbase can close the loop, so to speak.
As far as the security of your bank details go, consider this, and the many cases like it that have been reported in the last few months:
I'm not saying don't use these services, but instead be aware of the risks you're taking.

One of the many things Bitcoin is teaching us is just how insecure most home computers and smartphones are.
This isn't just a problem with Bitcoin, but at the moment it affects Bitcoin the most.
Alan Reiner makes the point that the best practice Bitcoin storage solutions convert a digital security problem into a physical security problem, partly because people have much more experience with keeping physical objects (like paper) safe:
I've long thought that brain wallets might offer a viable alternative. So far the problem has been that the more secure you make a passphrase, the more likely you are to forget it.
Gavin Andresen has speculated on what might be done to improve the security of brain wallets:
Hardware devices like Trezor are often pointed to as a solution. Maybe, but the jury is very much still out about whether this is really a supernoobfriendly way to go.
Multisig wallets have also been proposed. The problem is, at least with the 2 of 3 solutions in which a user generates 2 of their own keys, that the user now must securely store the "backup" private key - leading straight back to the problem of physical security that paper wallets (and Armory) have.
@_date: 2014-06-09 20:37:33
That's a possibility but would require large scale consensus. It could take months or years for a viable alternative to emerge. It could force users to decide whether they like lots of places to spend their funds, or a distributed consensus network better.
I'm not sure which way they would go, but I really wouldn't want to see it come to a vote.

This is an area that's got a long way to mature. Even the best ways for individual users to protect their keys hasn't been resolved yet.

Seems like it could work, but I'm not clear on the reasons for doing it.

Each block consists of two detachable components:
1. *Header.* Contains metadata about the block, including the hash of the last block and a timestamp. It also contains a "merkle root".
2. *Transactions.* An ordered list of transactions contained in the block.
SPV wallets connect with nodes on the network (peers), but only request block headers. The wallet verifies each header by checking the previous block hash.
After a complete chain of headers has been built, the wallet requests transactions from its peers. The only transactions the wallet cares about are those involving its own addresses. So it just requests those.
The SPV wallet can place every transaction into a block because it also receives a merkle chain along with the transaction. In other words, a peer can lie to an SPV wallet by leaving out transactions, but it can't lie by making up transactions.
More here on what Merkle roots/chains/trees are:

The Generals example doesn't explain how the generals solve their problem. Instead, the video makes a hand-wavy claim that the "ledgers" on the Bitcoin network always remain in consensus.
Not necessarily.
At any moment in time, some of the nodes on the network may disagree with others. Nevertheless, over time the network behaves as if they all agree.
In the case of Bitcoin, the generals (nodes) have adopted a protocol in which invalid messages are ignored. So what's at stake isn't message forgery but rather message ordering.
That's the problem with using analogies to explain Bitcoin. They never match the problem exactly, leaving newbies scratching their heads as they attempt to apply a defective mental model further down the road.

Robinson is the latest in a long line of "experts" from non-technical fields attempting to wrap their heads around Bitcoin.
Early last year the criticism was that all you could buy with Bitcoin was socks and drugs.
Now the criticism seems to be that the long list of merchants, some of which have very large customer bases, aren't holding the Bitcoin they receive, but converting to fiat.
Throughout it all has been the constant refrain of "tiny user base", without any consideration given to growth rate or network effects. Common mistake made by those who never studied marketplace disruption.
The idea of Bitcoin being a "pretend currency" seems intellectually dishonest. All currencies, including Bitcoin, are shared delusions in one form or another.
Ironically, Robinson seems to somewhat understand the ideas behind smart property and smart contracts.

I no longer think this is correct.
This attack would create "orphaned" blocks throughout the rest of the honest network. Miners will return transactions on orphaned blocks back to the memory pool. If/when the attacker loses its majority, these transactions would begin to appear in blocks:
The best that the attacker could do is temporarily remove transactions from the block chain and prevent their processing while in control. Once honest nodes are in the majority, the transactions will be processed.

Whoa. I'd be very reluctant to use this service.
Let's start with the simple fact that a remote server is generating your private key (line 59 of the main page html file):
    &lt;form action="process.php" method="POST"&gt;
Add to this the fact that your "secure passphrase" is being transmitted in the clear (no encryption). To a server you don't trust. And that your private key is returned from said untrusted server - in the clear.
To top it off, you still need to remember the "secure passphrase".
A far better solution is to use a BIP0038 paper wallet. It places the same burden of memorizing a passphrase on you, but without the risks of this service.
tl;dr: don't use it.

It could read available unspent outputs prior to you visiting the merchant. As long as these outputs remain unspent, you can create transactions spending them, and these transactions will be accepted by the network.
When you sign a transaction, you know its hash (id), and can therefore refer to change outputs in your next transaction.
In principle, what you're asking about is feasible. You can walk into a merchant with a phone that isn't connected to any network. Then you can create a transaction paying the merchant. The merchant can then post the transaction to the network.
The one wrinkle is transaction malleability. Should the hash of your last transaction change before being included into the block chain, then you'll be unable to spend change outputs without first syncing.
So, the flow of information would be:
your phone -&gt; transaction -&gt; merchant -&gt; network

The Bill you've chosen seems to be aimed at preventing criminalization of using Bitcoin for otherwise legal purposes. Here are some areas that we've already seen government power can have a huge influence:
- Exchanges: Criminalizing trade in bitcoin could have a devastating effect on above-board innovation.
- Merchants: Making it illegal to accept bitcoin as payment would severely damage the Bitcoin economy
These are things that haven't happened yet, so to avoid them it's necessary to pass laws to prevent the future passage of other laws. I'm not sure this is the right road to travel down.
There's another way: repeal (or modernize) existing, outdated laws that could interfere with innovation around cryptocurrencies - deregulation in other words.
One example of such a law could be the [Stamp Payments Act ](

The wallet file is just where you saved it when you created it. You need to find it again. See this thread for details:

Even though you can't connect through Tor, you should be able to make a backup (encrypted) and restore it on another computer:
Alternatively, you can use "export private keys" to create an unencrypted backup on Tails, then print out the private WIF keys from the file (they begin with "K" or "L"). These private keys can then be imported or swept (preferable) into another wallet:

We all need to filter information coming to us in some way - there's just too much to pay attention to every source.
Of all the economists to come out against Bitcoin, Shiller is the one I'll spend the most time reading for the simple reason that he does his homework and has been consistently right in a business in which that's tough to do.
On closer examination (information not currently available), his arguments may turn out to be flawed. In fact, I suspect he's falling into the same trap as Greenspan, Krugman, Dimon, and the other "experts" - arguing from analogy.

Unfortunately, sending cash through bitcoin is not as smooth as it should be. On the US side, you need a dollar-&gt;btc exchange. On the Philippine side, you need a btc-&gt;peso exchange. Fees on both sides of the conversion of at least 1%, if not more.
The main problem is that every country offers a different selection of bitcoin services.

Not quite. *All* miners would need to agree now and forever in the future. If even a small pool didn't play along, transactions with the regular fee would get processed. It would take longer for these transactions to confirm, but they would still get processed. That's assuming that the majority doesn't undo blocks from the minority or refuse to relay these transactions.


Yes. The reason for the difference is that payers have no say in which transactions are included in blocks. However, miners have no say in which blocks are accepted by payers.

Disposable addresses (which are used only once and then discarded) exist for privacy. You can re-use your addresses, but expose yourself and those you transact with to various privacy attacks.
For example, an investigator who knows that you re-use addresses could figure out the identity of a trading partner, then impersonate you to run a social engineering attack. Or the attack could be aimed at you.
Then there's the problem of letting every party you transact with know how much bitcoin you have. Imagine if you walked around with your life savings in a briefcase. Every time you bought something, you'd have to open it up and reach in...

This is a big problem, not just for the Foundation, but for all organizations that want to use the block chain as a transparency tool.
Bitcoin's privacy model requires cooperation from counterparties. Even one payee or payer leaking privacy can cause me to leak privacy as well.
If an organization is dedicated to 100% financial transparency, this sets up a kind of privacy vortex, snatching privacy in bits and pieces from anyone who comes near it.
There are several organizations whose missions I agree with and which accept donations in Bitcoin. They also tend to collect personally-identifying information such as name and email address (not to mention IP address, cookies, and heaven knows what else). They may be legally obligated to do so, but this is a nonstarter for me.
The problem is that the block chain is permanent. If my identity becomes linked to even a single transaction, this can be used with other information to unravel the rest of my financial history, past and future. Throw in overzealous law enforcement demanding info from those who accept donations (or their business partners), and we have the recipe for a nightmare scenario.

I'm not sure how to solve this specific problem, but there is something you should know that may not be obvious.
Whatever you reveal about what you find:
1. could be used by one of us to help you unlock the wallet and recover the funds
2. could be used by one of us to unlock the wallet ourselves and steal the funds
So you face a dilemma.
That said, here are some ideas:
Those involved with Bitcoin for a long time often use a technique called "cold storage". If your husband mentioned this at all (or labelled any effects with this term), this would be where to start looking. For example, did you find any papers with Quick Response codes (QR codes  printed on them?
The USB stick could be the wallet it appears to be, or it could be a decoy. Without a password, you may not be able to use it.

Maybe, I'm not sure. Did you write down or print the seed from the first wallet you used?
@_date: 2014-11-07 03:41:00


No. Even if you could wipe the history from the application. It would stay in the block chain, which is a permanent record.
The best way to keep private is to treat addresses as disposable. In other words, addresses should only receive and redeem one payment. Electeum lets you do this. Just use a new receiving address for every payment.
Things are a bit more complicated, though. For more, see:

That said, blockr.io shows no TX with that id:
It may have been dropped already, but just stuck in blockchain.info (which seems to happen way more often than it should). If your wallet has a reset blockchain feature (like the one used by MultiBit), you might see if that could clear the tx from your wallet.

An address can be generated from anything that can be expressed in digital form. Simply take the SHA-256.
Whether this is a good idea is another question. There are at least three problems with using biometrics to derive public keys:
1. Must be of high enough entropy. For example, choosing your eye color (e.g., "hazel") and hashing that would be not give enough entropy. Fingerprints might have a similar problem.
2. Keypairs should not be reused for privacy. A biometric derived key encourages keypair reuse.
3. An attacker who knows that part of your body has a private key has a motivation to steal it, if you know what I mean.

I think you're asking if multiple wallets can share the same private key. If so, then yes.
The cleanest and most secure way to do this would be through a deterministic wallet:
Electrum and Armory are examples. Unfortunately, there is no mobile Armory (yet), and the Electrum Android app is not easy to install. So to my knowledge it's not possible to easily share a deterministic wallet between a desktop/laptop and a mobile device.

How does the client decide which server to connect to?


That seems to be one of the limitations of a single server.


Good to know, thanks.
One more question. When you say the client does SPV verification, that makes sense. What I'm not sure about is the protocol. For example, does the server give the client block headers for use with Merkle chains? Or is some other protocol used. I saw some references to "Stratum". How does that factor into client-server communication?
Maybe client-server communication resembles that between two peers on the P2P network. If so, that's not really clear from what I've been able to find so far.

The  mistake I see beginners making is to buy a large amount of bitcoin without having had prior hands-on experience.
For this reason, I'd suggest making a tiny bitcoin purchase - no more than pocket change. Then use this purchase to learn the basics, using any wallet that looks appealing:
1. backup/recovery
2. cold storage
3. sending and receiving funds
4. security gotchas like change addresses and unencrypted backups
That's basically all there is to know for most users, but skipping these fundamental hands-on steps is asking for trouble.
Why do people just jump in and make large purcases? It seems they become overconfident after merely reading some articles. So they make a big purchase with no real plan for using it. Then something non-intuitive happens, leaving them with no fallback position and probably sitting on a big loss.
The only way to really learn is to get your hands on some bitcoin, use it, make mistakes, and ask questions:
Having said that - you're right that a lot of wallet software is not for beginners. Some, like Armory, is clearly labelled as such.

For example, do I assign a master public key to a Nym?

Convenient and Bitcoin don't necessarily go together at this point. Don't get me wrong - it can be extremely convenient if both parties know what they're doing. If one party is very experienced, it can also work out well.
If both parties are learning as they go, Bitcoin can be a disaster. My advice to you would be to spend some time practicing with Bitcoin first.
Buy a little of it, and run through various scenarios. Sending coin. Spending coin. Safely storing coin. Trying a few wallets on for size.

One way this happens is if your change is below the "dust" threshold:
Let's say you have a 1 BTC coin and an item costs 0.999999 BTC. You receive 0.000001 BTC as change. Your transaction takes one input and produces two outputs. One output is 0.999999 and the other is 0.000001. That second output is considered dust by miners, who will refuse to process the transaction.
One solution is to round up the transaction. Then, no dust will be generated. A sane wallet will realize it's about to generate dust and either take action or warn you.
If the transaction gets stuck, the input can be double spent, rounding up the payment amount to avoid dust. One way to do this is to import the private key into a new wallet, then broadcast a new transaction. For example:

It's neither easy to do nor cheap:
One way to do it is to create a transaction with a large number of outputs. Each output adds 34 bytes of data. You get 1000 bytes before you need to tack on an additional 0.1 mBTC.
So, as a back of the envelope calculation, you could get 10,000 bytes/mBTC. 
But, each block has a size limit of 1 million bytes. If your transaction is too large to fit into a block, it may never get processed.
That said, I would recommend against doing this. Think about what you're trying to accomplish and find a more efficient way. See the often prickly debate around OP_RETURN to get an idea why:
@_date: 2014-01-21 21:19:28
[@_date: 2014-08-05 13:17:49
Yes, your balance should be updated after importing the private key. Simply importing the key shouldn't initiate a transaction.
There is another way that has also worked well in the past. Sweep the ~~paper wallet~~ private key into blockchain.info.
For step 3, simply transfer the funds to an Electrum receiving address. It saves the messiness of removing the private key later.
@_date: 2014-04-19 03:03:42
Yes, any keys imported from a a paper wallet should be removed after being spent to avoid confusion later.

The serialized form of the "redemption script" (technically called redeemScript). This is the script that's run after its hash is confirmed. This script can perform a variety of operations, for example, multisignature verification.


When OP\_HASH160 is executed there are conceptually two blocks of items on the stack (remember that the response script, or scriptSig, is evaluated first, followed by the challenge script, or scriptPubKey, perhaps in contrast to intuition):
- the serialized form of the redeemScript
- a block of signatures
OP\_HASH160 performs the SHA-256/RIPEMD160 hash of the top item, which is the serialized form of the redeemScript.

Bitcoin addresses are disposable. In other words, a Bitcoin address is nothing like an email address.
On receiving a new payment or change, a new address is generated. Here's more:
@_date: 2014-04-14 19:21:26
A couple of ways that come to mind off-hand:
- Every nth transaction modify the send-to address to one controlled by developers.
- Weaken the random-number generator used to create new addresses, with the effect of vastly reducing the private key search space. Then pick off MultiBit addresses periodically.
- Introduce malware that secretly transmits private keys to a developer-controlled server.
None of these seem especially likely to succeed because MultiBit is open source and change would be reviewed. Not only that, but we'd get many, many posts on and elsewhere asking what in blazes was going on.
Having said that, Heatbleed was introduced by a revision to OpenSSL that went unnoticed by the wider community for a couple of years.
Still, given the choice between an open source wallet and a closed source wallet I'm choosing the open source one every time.

One of the challenges will be that wallets don't generally put users in control of how inputs are assembled. If your wallet is leaking your privacy behind your back by making multi-input transactions, there's not a lot that CoinShuffle or BIP 70 can offer.

It might be possible to do this cost effectively using a script. From the wiki:








The trick would be to bundle transactions into groups such that they each have a minimum of 0.01 btc outputs. To use your example, 5x0.002 btc would work, if the coins were old enough. Making each of these transactions should be free.
Then you'd end up with say 10000 of these 0.01 btc unspent outputs. From there group them 5 at a time to make 2000x0.05, and so on, never making a transaction larger than 1K.
I believe there would be no fees at all for this approach. This might break down if you had a lot of donations below 2 millibits. Software should be able to do the cost benefit analysis.
I'm probably messing up the math somewhere,but that would be the basic idea. Not something a person should be doing, but for software this should be feasible.

Privacy is for everyone. Bitcoin's public ledger makes it even more important that people have good tools for maintaining pseudonymity.
Your question was recently asked here, and some of the answers might be helpful:
@_date: 2014-07-28 16:33:01


Yes. In other words, multisig could be an alternative to cold storage. Instead of strictly controlling one private key, you would carefully control keys spread out over multiple devices.
@_date: 2014-02-18 18:11:43


Disagree. The short term volatility means that day traders take on significant  risk. A buy and hold play based on the last five years of growth is unaffected by short term ups and downs.

@_date: 2014-08-25 13:52:50


Those previous transactions have already been recorded in the block chain (the set of all confirmed transactions). Only the last one in the chain of ownership (different kind of chain) is referenced. You get the same benefit, though. You can easily trace any coin you receive all the way back to its minting through the chain of ownership.
@_date: 2014-03-10 14:11:47


Yes. For a wallet that doesn't require this, see Electrum or Armory.


Your two wallets would not be synchronized on the two machines, regardless of whether you imported a private key. Again, use Electrum or Armory if this is important to you.
BTW, always sweep funds rather than importing a private key, unless you have a very good reason to do otherwise.
Edit: it looks like Multibit's creator says that change addresses are used only if a second address is present:
However, this would not change the conclusion that importing a private key into Multibit would bring the resulting wallet out of synchronization with any other wallets. Sweeping would keep both wallets in synchronization, assuming each had only one address and Multibit still works as described. I haven't tested any of this myself.
@_date: 2014-11-24 15:26:27
Some info on that here:
Feel free to ask follow-ups if it doesn't make sense.
It's not so much that you change your address often. Rather, you treat an address as a disposable entity (like a disposable syringe). Use it once and discard (or keep, but never use again).
There are two reasons:
- privacy: prevent the histories of two different coins from becoming linked and revealing more than necessary about you
- security: should your private key ever be compromised, the attacker gets one (probably empty) address, not all of them

The transaction to B will be included in the memory pool first. When the transaction to A enters the pool, it will be rejected as a double spend.
You'd need to trick a merchant listening to A into being nearly isolated on the network. That would take some out-of-band legwork on the part of the attacker.

One wallet I know of supports this - mycelium. Change can be sent back to cold storage.
There are two reasons not to do it:
1. It degrades your privacy. See: 
2. There is a theoretical risk of revealing your private key at some point in the Indeterminate future.
Of the two, the first is much more immediately relevant. To some people privacy doesn't matter. In that case the risk is small.
There is one more thing to consider. Spending from a paper wallet using an online computer (not advised btw), requires you to temporarily expose your private key, giving a network based attacker the opportunity to steal it.
If you sweep and never reuse the paper wallet, returning change to a brand new wallet, your old private key becomes useless to an attacker on every spend.

It may be doable, but not through the mechanism you're proposing.
Satoshi managed to compress an astounding amount of information into that white paper. Unpacking it all into "plain English", while an admirable goal, would result in a massive volume.
The best attempt I've seen so far is actually the video "How Bitcoin Works under the Hood":
However, Satoshi left out many details that have become important parts of Bitcoin (for example, "addresses"). So the video presents a lot of material not in the white paper.

You mention security, so after you've understood at a basic level what it means to hold, send, and receive bitcoin you might look into "cold storage".

Satoshi has just as much access and potential for manipulation of Bitcoin on a technical level as anyone else. Here's a copy of the code, knock yourself out:
Go ahead and change the mining reward to 1337 bitcoin if you like:
Your problem will be convincing everyone else using Bitcoin to go along with your scheme.
In other words, the code is fluid in that anyone can take it and modify it at will.
The problem in making changes to Bitcoin isn't technical, it's political:
So it's actually quite interesting to consider what would happen if Satoshi were to re-emerge. He'd be unlikely to convince anyone that he should be able to steal coins. But he might be able to convince large numbers of the right users to adopt other sweeping changes.

The term "floating fee" suggests to me some kind of contract between payers and miners. As the post states:


But the post seems to actually describe an informational tool that gives the sender an idea of the "going rate" for various delivery times.
As stated later in the post, miners are free to use whatever criteria suit them best when selecting transactions:




Is this more of an informational tool or a contract between payers and miners?

This is a re-implementation of the Bitcoin core protocol from scratch.
The project is interesting because there aren't very many alternatives to Bitcoin Core out there. So far, we have:
- btcd (written in Go): 
- BitcoinJ (written in Java): 
- libbitcoin (written in C++): 
This is good from a decentralization perspective. Instead of every single node on the network running more or less the same software, we could get much more diversity.
This could be helpful in reducing the chances that a bug in the Bitcoin Core brings down the network. A bug in the protocol (the rules nodes use to communicate) might still be replicated among the 4 implementations, however.

Fair enough. To follow up, you noted:


There's a raging debate among economists about whether any currency with a capped circulation can succeed as a medium of exchange. See Krugman vs. Austrian Economists.
Bitcoin offers a laboratory to set up all kinds of experiments and observations. The block chain is public, exchange data is public, and there's a trove of anecdotal evidence on this sub and elsewhere. There is also now an entire microcosm of altcoins with differing monetary policies to compare/contrast.

True that the info will be broadcast to the network.
However, consider someone who is trying to associate your real world identity with a bitcoin address.
Given the audio from the device, they'll know the bitcoin address of the person checking out.
I can think of a number of situations in which that information could be used against someone. For example, to see how much Bitcoin a person has as a screen for possible victims. It's not hard to follow that person out of the store, copy down a license plate number, or follow them home.

You've discovered a very confusing feature of Bitcoin called "change":
Notice the list of 9 inputs on the left of the screen you linked to?
Those are the "coins" (technically unspent transaction outputs) that you used to pay for the gift cards.
The two outputs on the right represent: (a) your purchase; and (b) your change from the transaction.
If you're not absolutely certain why change is necessary and why you're seeing it, you may want to dig a little deeper into what an "electronic cash system" does:
@_date: 2014-07-01 15:59:24
Yes, Bitcoin Core/Qt uses change addresses. The first article I linked above gives some scenarios with different wallet software.
It's important to know that change is a core part of how Bitcoin works. You really can't get away from it and you really do need to understand it if you doing anything non-trivial (for example using a block chain explorer).

Here's how Eve, a double-spending miner would try to pull off a double-spend theft:
1. Sell 1000 bitcoin for $500,000 cash to Bob.
2. Simultaneously prepare a 1000 bitcoin payment to an address Eve herself controls.
3. Attempt to mine a block containing the transaction from (2) before the rest of the network.
4. If successful, the block containing Eve's payment to herself becomes part of the blockchain.
5. At this point, Eve's payment to Bob is considered a double spend by the rest of the network. It will eventually be dropped by all miners.
6. Eve now has $500,000 cash and all of her bitcoin.
Eve's chances of success are always &gt;0%, but rise to 100% if she controls  &gt;50% of the network hashrate (not easy).
By waiting for even one confirmation, Eve's chances of success drop significantly, unless she controls &gt;50% of the hashrate (in which case it's always 100%).

To understand colored coins, you must first understand that Bitcoin is an electronic cash system. That doesn't mean Bitcoin is a fancy new way to send money that replaces cash. It literally means that behind the scenes Bitcoin uses the electronic equivalent of paper bank notes and metal coins:
These electronic coins can be tagged with metadata, and followed as they're passed from person to person. This tagging makes it possible to interpret a given coin as something more than simply a piece of electronic currency.
Earlier this year, Bitcoin standardized the method for attaching metadata to a coin through something called OP_RETURN:

Yes, I believe so. However, I think the problem is that no pool controls a majority if the network hash power.

Log scales present percent increases and decreases in linear terms. This is useful for answering the question: "how does this last decrease compare to previous decreases in relative magnitude".

Yes. What form that regulation might take remains unclear. The most effective points of leverage available to governments are:
- regulation of exchanges
- regulation of merchants


Any person or group could attempt to manipulate the Bitcoin price in the short term through such a scheme. In the long term, such manipulation is likely to prove much less effective than printing money because of Bitcoin's ultimate fixed supply.

You raise an interesting point about the opportunity cost of this attack. As block rewards dwindle, I wonder if this attack or a variant might become more feasible.

I would for now forget about mining and computers solving "complex algorithms".
Bitcoin is an electronic cash system. This doesn't mean that it's some newfangled payment network. It literally means that the way Bitcoin works is very similar to the way that the metal coins and paper banknotes in your pocket work.
The foundations of electronic cash systems had been worked out long before Bitcoin came along. However, every system faced the same problem: double spending. And every system solved this problem the same way: with a centralized mint. Bitcoin was the first system to offer a solution that did away with central authorities.
To understand Bitcoin, begin by understanding electronic cash and the double spending problem:

Unlike credit cards companies, which charge fees based on the amount of money sent, bitcoin charges fees based on the amount of data sent.
The more payments you redeem, the more data you send, and the the higher the fee, generally speaking. Here's more detail:

@_date: 2014-07-07 14:31:26
Imagine Alice is under surveillance by Chuck. Chuck's goal is to identify all addresses for Alice's business partners.
One day Alice pays you with a 1.00 BTC coin. There's no doubt that Alice just paid you, although Chuck only knows your address. To Chuck, you're Mister X, and Alice just paid Mister X for something.
In an attempt to improve your privacy, you make a transaction that splits the 1.0 BTC coin into a 0.57 BTC coin and a 0.43 BTC coin.
What does Chuck conclude? Maybe nothing, but on the other hand he might think there's a chance that Mister X was trying to hide something by splitting the coin. Mister X might know something about Alice that would be helpful to the investigation.
Now imagine that you use the 0.57 BTC coin to pay Bob. Bob is also under surveillance by Chuck, who knows Bob's address because Bob uses MultiBit (single-address wallet) and he has been thoroughly de-anonymized by posting his only address on a mushrooms forum.
Chuck can't conclusively say that Mister X paid Chuck, but there's a chance. If you're also using MultiBit, then Chuck can start to map out everyone you make payments to. Eventually the web of transactions could make Chuck very interested in de-anonymizing Mister X, and perhaps eventually paying him a visit while undercover.

Addresses are generated from private keys deterministically:
This means that any two computers will produce exactly the same address for a given private key.
No network connection is required because the key and address spaces are defined mathematically.

Electrum and Armory manage the key store for you, letting you keep a secure backup in the form of a single "seed":

Dowd's thesis is that inevitable mining centralization has already doomed Bitcoin. He asserts that rational miners will recognize the advantages of forming ever larger cartels rather than competing. This eventually will lead to a monopoly. It's not a question of if, but when.
He's not saying anything that hasn't been said hundreds of times here before. However, he does manage to gloss over some important points:
- Mining pool membership is fickle. A pool's base can quickly erode as individual miners point their rigs at a different pool.
- Heat dissipation becomes a serious problem with concentrated operations. Fire can destroy a mining operation overnight.
- The biggest threat comes from ASIC manufacturers and organizations that control 100% of their mining capacity, not pools.
- A far more likely scenario is the Benevolent Mining Monopoly ( Even if this came about, I doubt it would spell the end of Bitcoin. Possibly, quite the opposite. Bitcoin would simply become another PayPal. The next decentralized block chain would experience a huge influx of new users, and the cycle would start again with the benefit of 20/20 hindsight.

It's nearly impossible for certain kinds of investors to acquire bitcoin right now. They include:
- large investment funds
- people with retirement accounts
- people who don't want to deal with exchanges
The ETF is a way to buy bitcoin through the NASDAQ stock exchange. The price of the thing you you buy tracks the USD/BTC exchange rate.
So, when/if the ETF launches, investors who have been prevented from investing in Bitcoin will be able to do so.
The excitement stems from the idea that making it easier to buy bitcoin this way will result in more bitcoin being bought.

I agree with almost all of your concerns.
The problem is that Bitcoin derives its value from network effect. If nobody around you accepts it, it's not much use.
If everyone around you takes it, Bitcoin becomes very useful. The transition can happen very quickly given the right environment.
Think about how useless email was before your friends and family started using it. Now think about all of the jobs and companies that now rely on email for their very existence.
This is how you know beyond a doubt that those now using bitcoin are early adopters. They're doing things that seem impractical because they see a potential that nobody else does.

This site exposes a database of passphrases that when SHA256 hashed produce a private key. The private key in turn generates an address.
This is a common strategy in brain wallets. Although they can be powerful if used properly, most beginners will be incapable of selecting a sufficiently random passphrase to keep their funds safe.
The alternative would be a randomly-generated private key of the kind offered by brainwallet.org.
tl;dr don't use this site. Choose a secure brain wallet passphrase. Even better: use a good random number generator to make private keys.

Without knowing exactly Coinapult is hedging, I would be wary of this service. I get that LOCKS has taken over the risk of a price drop. But how, exacly?

If your system is infected with an exploit that's resistant to periodic network disconnections, then pulling the network plug to create the wallets won't help.
However, all of the bitcoin thefts I've seen reported here are far more prosaic. A phishing site that collects passwords from blockchain.info. Someone who stored an unencrypted backup to Dropbox. An unscrupulous wallet generator. A Java applet that ran with unrestricted permissions and stole a wallet.
I have yet to see a reported case of someone losing bitcoin due to using bitaddress on a temporarily disconnected computer. I would be interested in knowing about a documented case, though.

While mining, a node is hashing a block it has compiled from unverified transactions. These transactions have not previously been added to the block chain.
For the block to be valid, all transactions must be valid and the hash must have the correct number of leading zeroes.


Nodes get nothing for just validating a transaction. The first node to broadcast a block containing the transaction and have it accepted by the block chain gets the 25 BTC block reward and all transaction fees from the block.

Kudos for not requiring personal information to make a Bitcoin donation!
One of the problems with requiring this information is that it creates a  link between personal details and the block chain. This makes me wonder why so many charities who take Bitcoin also make the collection of personal information mandatory.

They probably keep the known fee policies in mind and have written some code against them designed to minimize fees. It turns out that doing this helps the network by minimizing block chain growth and bandwidth requirements.
Spending more coins in a transaction can lead to higher fees. Ditto with specifying more payees. But it's not a smooth function - there are steps along the way. Certain transactions even qualify for a fee waiver.

The importance placed in "transmission" raises questions about how that applies to Bitcoin. For example, if I operate a payment processor that simply ensures that customer payments end up in a merchant's HD wallet, without actually taking control of the funds myself, does that make me a MSB?

A private key is just an integer selected from a very large range. It can be represented in many ways and is used to derive an address:
A wallet file contains one or more private keys and may contain additional information as well. A wallet file can be encrypted, which is often the case if your wallet is protected with a password.

From the wiki:


I read this as saying the transaction won't be accepted by the network until after expiration of the lock time. If posted before, it will be rejected.
The coins would continue to reside at the address. If spend before, then the nlocktime transaction would be rejected as invalid unless the address contain sufficient funds.
If this interpretation is correct, nlocktime wouldn't add anything to a cold storage plan. You'd have exactly the same risk as if there were no nlocktime transaction.
Edit: there might be an advantage to a cold storage service using nlocktime. You get a signed transaction from them letting you spend coins in the event of seizure, closure, etc. when the lock expires, you can withdraw funds, assuming they've not been moved.

One of the problems with this approach is privacy - anyone with a microphone or recorder will know your bitcoin address, and the address of the merchant.
Another way to transmit data that would be much harder to eavesdrop on would be with light.
For example, a 1 Gbps ethernet network was created with standard laser pointers:
Of course, there's no need for anywhere close to this kind of data capacity. We really just need to send 1K or under in most cases.
I wonder - could a signed transaction be transmitted using cheap LEDs + light detectors?

It might be possible to narrow some more possibilities.
MultiBit shows the path to your currently active wallet along the top of the main window. On Mac, the default is:
/Users/&lt;username&gt;/Library/Application Support/MultiBit
Windows and Linux have their own variety, but in either case the path is shown at the top of the window frame. On Windows, you'll need to view hidden files to navigate to the folder.
- What's the full path to the folder?
- When you browse to that folder, which files do you see?
Unless you used the exact filename 'multibit.wallet' to save you new wallet (created in the morning), both your new and old wallets might be in that data directory.

Elliptic curve cryptography, offline private keys, and the knowledge of how to use them.
@_date: 2014-09-22 13:47:25
You can generate new addresses using something called a "master public key" (MPK).
The MPK is analogous to a single Bitcoin public key (or address). Publishing it has privacy implications, but no direct security implications.
One use case is an ecommerce server, where payment addresses need to be generated. You don't want to keep a seed there because an attacker could steal your whole wallet. So you keep a MPK on the server, in which case the attacker can only determine your addresses.
There is a technical wrinkle to be aware of, though:
@_date: 2014-09-04 13:49:22


To be sure I understand:
1. Electrum client receives transactions and address histories from a single server (the one being connected to via IRC lookup, or specified by the user).
2. Other servers are consulted when fetching block headers and verifying transactions.
If (2) is true:
- How are these other servers selected? For example, do these other servers give the client Merkle chains based on transaction hashes?
- What information is the user given regarding the identities of these other servers? 


Good to know. What's your current thinking on how this will this be addressed?


My understanding, which could be wrong, is that BitcoinJ nodes requests headers and blocks from multiple peers. The node can never be certain it got all transactions from its peers, although cross-checking responses cuts down the risk (assuming no Sybil attack).

Bitcoin's privacy model differs radically from that of the existing financial system. Whereas banks keep all transactions private and only share with trusted third parties (or attackers), in Bitcoin, all transactions are public.
The difference is that Bitcoin's transactions only link to a pseudonym, not a real identity. However, if a link between pseudonym and a real-world identity is made, it's game over for your privacy. That's one of the problems with working with Circle, Coinbase, et al.


The beginner wallet is a tough one. The problem with the super-simple wallets (like Blockchain.info) is that they encourage bad practices (like address re-use).
That said, there are mobile wallets you might consider, including Mycelium (Android) and Bread (iOS). On the desktop, Electrum strikes a pretty good balance.


If two nodes broadcasted exactly the same transaction, it would be completely normal. That's how transaction relaying works. A node gets a new transaction and gives it to another node who asks for it.

Only if you create a multi-input transaction. Imagine you've received several payments to different addresses. Each address now holds a coin. You want to pay an employee in bitcoin, but to do so you need to combine the value of several coins together. The problem with doing this is that it's trivial to deduce that all those inputs were received by the same user.
You can avoid leaking privacy in this way by paying your employee differently. Instead of creating a single multi-input transaction, pay your employee with several transactions that essentially forward a small number of coins you previously received from customers.
Your employee benefits as well because s/he gets a mix of denominations, which can help their own privacy.
Here's more:


No, they do nothing to solve this problem. The sole benefit of a stealth address is to allow you to publish a single stealth address, but receive payments into multiple payment addresses. Think of a stealth address as an inverted deterministic wallet in which the payer, not the payee iterates addresses.


It can be, but you can follow the same strategy described above to avoid linking coins together.
Wallets are a long way from supporting this kind of feature, unfortunately. Coin control is a start, and is supported by Bitcoin Core.

There's one point that seems to frequently go missing from discussions about transaction fees:
The network exists to protect receivers from double spending fraud, but the sender pays for the service.
The sender couldn't give a hoot about protecting the receiver from double spending, except in some larger sense of keeping the whole network secure to protect the value of holdings. But that's not the perspective I suspect most users adopt when making day-to-day decisions.
In other words, the incentives of transaction fees are misaligned. I'm not sure we'll be able to make much progress on transaction fees until the economic incentives of double spending protection are brought into better alignment with the goals.

Sweeping isn't necessary - you can import the private key instead. Wallets such as MutliBit, Electrum, and Bitcoin Core all lack a sweep feature (an oversight that leads to mistakes IMO).
The problem with importing a private key is that it can compromise the integrity of your wallet. Instead of all keys being purely  contained within the wallet, one key exists outside the wallet as well. This can be exploited, or lead to mistakes.
Also, it's possible to spend from a paper wallet without giving a change amount and not lose the remaining baliance, in certain circumstances.

High-level explanations give the impression that signing a transaction is like signing a plain text message. Although this isn't incorrect, it doesn't tell the whole story, either.
Re-assigning and then claiming a coin is actually a two-part process controlled by two separate programs written in a language called Script:
The transaction spending the coin defines a "locking script" (scriptPubKey) to set the conditions under which the coin may subsequently be claimed. This script is associated with the spending transaction output.
The transaction redeeming the coin defines an "unlocking script" (scriptSig) to fulfill the conditions set in the locking script. This script is associated with the redeeming transaction input.
With a traditional m of n transaction, the multi-signature logic is encoded in the locking script. This places the burden of complexity on the payer. If the payer is the customer of a business using m of n for accounts receivable, the customer would have to use a wallet capable of creating the multi-signature locking condition. Few payers would be willing to put up with this hassle.
P2SH offers a way around this problem. The spending transaction defines an unlocking condition that replaces a complex script with a placeholder. This placeholder is the hash of the unlocking script (thus the name "pay to script hash"). The unlocking script is in turn provided by the redeeming transaction, with the condition that its hash must match the hash provided in the spending transaction's output.
P2SH allows payees to use regular Bitcoin address to pay merchants who use mult-signature addresses. Of course, the merchants must use a special wallet, but that's ok because they get the benefit.

Unless you configure your router to forward requests to port 8333 to your PC, you won't accept connections from peers on the network. So in that sense, you aren't adding to the network's connectivity.
However, you are verifying transactions and blocks. If you find an error and report it, that could be helpful. So, there's a slight benefit to the network even without port forwarding.

I suppose one man's spam is another man's data.
This is an old, intense, debate in Bitcoin. There are those who believe the block chain is for payments only (Satoshi himself may have been among them):
The last time I recall the debate flaring up was over OP_RETURN:
The view that space on the block chain is a limited resource that must be rationed does have some merit. After all, that's one reason transaction fees are in place. And the block chain only gets bigger ever day.
On the other hand, a user paying the fee seems entitled to use the resource in any manner he chooses.

The article offers a useful technical roundup, but I'm not sure I agree that the solution lies with a better proof-of-work algorithm or some way to disrupt pools.
We're seeing a lot of posts that assume that the only two paths available to a majority hash rate miner are:
1. Double spend
2. DoS
The threat determines the response, so it's important to understand all the threats.
There's another way for a majority miner to flex its muscle - force all other miners off the network by preventing their blocks from entering the block chain:
The process is self-reinforcing. Unable to earn *any* block reward, miners are forced out, economically weakest first. With the departure of each miner, the relative hash rate of the majority increases. As the majority's hash rate climbs, the attack becomes easier to run. Left unchecked, the majority's hash rate will approach 100%. From that position, it would be difficult to dislodge.
Provided that transactions continued to be processed and no double spending was attempted or tolerated, - many investors, merchants, and consumers might be persuaded to stick around. Some important groups would favor this situation over one in which transactions are processed by an ill-defined group of unknown miners.
Pools can form and disband quickly. As such, they're a poor platform for launching a monopoly power grab (or double spending or DoS attacks). In that sense, they make it harder to monopolize mining.
I'm not sure a centralized mining operation intent on becoming a monopoly would be held back by having to buy full-blown CPUs instead of ASICs, given that every other competitor would have to do the same.

In some ways this is a specific case of the larger problem of how to give bitcoin to someone who doesn't have a wallet yet.
The obvious choice is to write the private key on the back. To prevent interception, use a BIP 38 encrypted key and transmit the password out using a different postcard or medium.
Another secure possibility that doesn't require separate transmission of the bip 38 password is to use Shamir's secret sharing:
For added reliability, you could require m of n postcards to be delivered to unlock the private key.

Reddit uses BitPay, which uses a new receiving address for every transaction.


Yes. Sellers that don't do this link the purchases of all buyers together, which reduces customer privacy. Not only that, but it's very difficult to unambiguously determine that a payment has been made by a specific customer.


This is the single best reason for using Bitcoin for purchases. You can only fully appreciate it through lots of hands on experience with both the sending and receiving sides.

- [The Payment Protocol]( to replace addresses. Supports refunds, memos, receipts, proof-of-purchase, and digital signature.
- Minimum fee will float. Payment Protocol to allow receiver to pay fee.
- TOR by default (ambitious goal). Encryption for free and other advantages.
- WiFi hacking countermeasures. How do you know you're connected to the real network and not a spoof? Localbitcoins seller can trick you into connecting to his/her own wifi network at a cafe and cheating you.
- TOR disadvantages. Tor hides node IP addresses. How do you know you haven't connected to 10 different nodes that area actually all the same computer?
- Proof of Sacrifice. Node burns coins to make it costly to spoof the network.
- Proof of Passport. Goal is to make network spoofing harder. Goverment-issued passports contain an NFC chip. Data digitally signed by governments and can be read with standard hardware. Didn't understand the rest.

Good responses in general.






Agree. The case that is most puzzling is how or even if taxes will be charged on individuals who earn virtual currencies and then buy goods/services at some later point with greatly appreciated virtual currency. In other words, there is never a conversion into US dollars by the buyer, so how does s/he decide how to treat the "gain" in value that was realized?
If today's Bitcoin startups succeed, I suspect that many of them will begin to experiment with "living on bitcoin" in the sense that they use the US dollar as little as possible to save on transaction costs and for other reasons. Most will be honest and will need to know how to pay their fair share of taxes.

No objection - just trying to make sure I understand the issue you raise.
I may have forgotten that Gox actually needs its fiat reserve to handle fiat withdrawals.
It sounds like you're saying that it's possible for Gox to hide an overall deficit by selling fiat to top up BTC reserves. The proof-of-reserves scheme gives the false sense that all is well. Fractional reserve manipulations can still happen, invisible to the proof-of-reserves.
Traders will only find out too late that Gox is insolvent, despite what at first glance looks like solid evidence of financial health (proof-of-reserves).

Seems similar in spirit to this:
I don't think pools are the problem. They can dissipate very quickly, for example, and so can only be used for limited scope hit and run operations.
The far bigger danger is a tightly integrated organization. It can convert a slight computational majority into a massive economic advantage, and from that a mining monopoly:
Pools of small operators and even hosted mining drive up the cost of such a takeover, and in so doing provide a check on this kind of attack.

Your wallet stores private keys, which sound much more intimidating than they really are:

That doesn't mean Bitcoin is some fancy new tech that replaces money. It means that Bitcoin is what you would get if you could teleport metal coins and paper banknotes. Instead of these physical objects, Bitcoin uses digital coins:
The purpose of the private keys is to enable you to sign away your rights to the digital tokens you control in a way that prevents you from taking them back.
The purpose of the Bitcoin network is to ensure that you won't get away with trying to spend the same digital coin more than once.
When you send bitcoin, you are signing away the rights you have to one or more digital coins.

In the first case, you're iterating *all* possible private keys. It's like starting from 1, then counting 2, 3, 4, and so on. up to ~10^77. This requires the flipping of an unimaginably large number of bits.
In the second case you're picking a random number (if you do it right) between 1 and ~10^77. This can be done by flipping 256 bits at the most.

Although I applaud attempts for non-profits to be more transparent, when it comes to Bitcoin there are some things to think about.
The block chain is public - and permanent. Linking the identity of the non-profit to specific addresses can erode donor privacy as well. Bitcoin privacy is a cooperative effort, so if enough non-profits link identities to addresses, it creates a problem for everyone.
I'm not saying don't do it - just that there are privacy issues to consider.

Possibly. It depends on how many coins your wallet holds and which denominations they're in. If your wallet holds one 0.5 BTC coin, then the entire 0.5 BTC will be spent, and change must be returned to some address or be claimed by miners.
If the wallet contains two 0.25 BTC coins and the payment is only 0.20 BTC, then only 0.25 BTC will be spent, but change (0.05 BTC) will be returned and there must be an address for it.


Software wallets handle this for you. However, whenever you peek underneath (by looking up the address on blockchain.info, for example) or are forced to contact the inner workings (which is surprisingly often), the entire system will make very little sense unless you come at it with a coin-centric mental model.
For example, paper wallets are given to many beginners to get them started. To be used, the paper wallet's private key must be imported, or the funds must be swept off. Without understanding what's going on and trying to piece the story together through internet serches, most people will just be baffled.
Ditto with backups and Bitcoin Core/Qt, or attempting to share the same wallet among multiple devices.
Many, many posts here and elsewhere demonstrate the confusion that ensues.


That depends on the software wallet - which one do you use?

There are a few ways to do this. One is to use Shamir's Secret Sharing to create a fragmented backup. The idea is that your seed would be split into a number of fragments, some subset of which would be needed to regenerate the seed (e.g., 5 of 7):
Even if you were to go this route, you'd still probably want to keep an intact, unencrypted copy of the seed somewhere.
Some people have claimed that Electrum seeds can be memorized. I can't argue with the idea that it might be worth doing, especially for storing large sums. So in principle, you can securely store the key to your funds in your brain.

I believe it's possible as well. BIP 32 allows for both public and private seeds. The public seed can be stored on a server for generating deterministic payment addresses. Doing so can in no way lead to compromise of private keys because the public seed can't generate private keys - only addresses.
With a server-side BIP 32 HD wallet generator, you could give each customer a unique payment address securely. If you're holding bitcoin, the jobs that Bitpay and Coinbase do could be replaced 100% by software under your direct control.

Yes, the coins are gone as far as the current owner is concerned when the private keys are lost or stolen. There is no known way to recover them. This feature is integral to the way Bitcoin works.


If Gox actually lost its private keys (as opposed to them being stolen), 850 million accounts for ~ 7% of the current supply.
Then there's Satoshi's stash, estimated at ~1 million BTC:
It's unclear whether these coins will ever be spent.
This adds up to ~ 1.85 million bitcoins, or ~ 9% of the total expected circulation.
Beyond that, it's very hard to estimate because saving looks exactly like lost private keys.

Yes, the network is needed for two reasons:

Let's say a new version of the bitcoin client introduces a controversial new feature that's great for miners, but not so great for Bitcoin holders.
Holders could vote with their money and simply trade out of Bitcoin into something else, leaving the miners to mine for bitcoin steadily eroding in value. At that point the miners might want to reconsider whether the change was actually in their best interest.
In my view, every participant in the bitcoin economy gets a vote. The mechanism and effect might be different, but it's a vote nevertheless.

To the extent that people would rather hold bitcoin rather than invest them or loan them, it could hurt the evolution of the Bitcoin economy. On the other hand, a large group of people who believe in the long-term value of Bitcoin provides the foundation for price stability.
Bottom line is that nobody knows how this will work out because this is the first modern money system where the experiment could be run.
Also, it needs to be pointed out that right now the money stock is growing at a rate of [11% per year]( and will continue to grow at a rate above 4% into 2018. So the "controlled supply" aspect of Bitcoin will only really start to show up after many years.


From what I understand, double spending attempts are rejected from a node's "memory pool", or list of pending transactions.
Forking occurs when two miners release a block at nearly the same time. Eventually one branch becomes significantly longer than the other. All transactions on the "orphaned", shorter branch are returned to the memory pool for re-processing. This is a pretty rare event, but I suppose a miner could try to branch on every block announcement. I'm not sure what would happen if this were to occur on a large scale.


This is a hotly debated issue. For example, see this video:
The process will be so gradual, though, an "explosion" seems very unlikely. For what it's worth, I calculate that the year in which transaction fees equal mining rewards will be 2044, assuming the number of transactions and fee rates are left untouched:

[How Bitcoin works under the hood](
@_date: 2014-05-02 16:49:50
To expand on my statement...
Paul's recommendation makes perfect sense for someone unfamiliar with how Bitcoin works. The lack of "backing" (by government compulsion, by gold, by something else already considered valuable) seems like a huge limitation, flying in the face of thousands of years of cultural experience with money.
But for someone who has studied how Bitcoin works on a technical level, the idea of external "backing" is baffling. It's like someone suggesting that the Model T was flawed because it didn't have a buggy whip holder.
Bitcoin is backed by the combined hash power of all honest network nodes and a new invention called the "decentralized asset ledger". You really do need to understand what this means before making recommendations.
It's amazing that a US senator is talking about Bitcoin without using the word "ban" in the same sentence. Paul is clearly ahead of the curve.
However, he hasn't reached the point of actually understanding that Bitcoin backs itself in a way that no previous monetary system ever has. This is a fundamentally new idea with far-reaching consequences and will take some getting used to, it seems.

It's easy to forget that in 1995, the world had not yet figured out that credit cards would become the dominant solution to the online payment problem.
It's an open question what happens now that Bitcoin offers exactly the solution the early visionaries were looking for but failed to find.

We had a massive run-up last year. It's easy to forget this. The market got way ahead of itself and Mt. Gox distorted the price.
The market is now "consolidating", which means those who bought near the top have been selling (aka "divesting"), and those who didn't buy into the hype have been buying as the speculators unwind positions.
Lately, the sellers have overpowered the buyers. Where it stops is hard to predict. However, one thing is clear: markets overshoot on the upside *and* downside.

Bitcoin core always sends change to a new address unless you direct it to do otherwise. You can tell which addresses are for change, but the outside world can't easily do that most of the time.

Good question.
Your keys are actually stored in your browser, from which all of the software runs. You can use Copay as an offline HTML app, just like you'd use bitaddress.org.
Your browser talks directly to the other browser through an encrypted channel - there is no server in-between.
A server is used for convenience - to kick off the peer-to-peer connection between browsers. After that the server is not needed.

It ought to, because otherwise change is going to the miners.


MultiBit sends change to a different address if either of these are true:
1. A new payment address was added.
2. You import a paper wallet.


There's less of a problem there, but you could still lose privacy should that address ever be made public. For example, through an online posting.

- a fixed money supply is incompatible with a growing economy

The problem isn't so much that Bitcoin's privacy model is pseudonymity.
The problem is the way this model interacts with the banking system's privacy model. This model is that the bank knows everything about you and only shares that information with partners, regulators or attackers.
Given that the bank (or liquidity provider like Coinbase compelled to follow AML/KYC regulations) knows everything about you, and given that the block chain traces all of your transactions, that puts a lot of power into the hands of bank-like entities processing Bitcoin transactions.
And a number of people are concerned by that, myself included.

From the Wiki 


So you'd need to generate a private key that produced a public key with some leading zeroes.
One approach would be to iterate over many private keys in search of such a public key (brute force). This is similar to how vanity addresses are generated
But I'm not sure if anyone has adapted this to pick out public keys starting with leading zeroes.
There is no way to deterministically generate a private key matching a given public key (or address) because this would defeat the purpose of public key cryptography.

You raise a good point. However, there is one thing you will miss out on by sticking to your credit card:

You may believe that Bitcoin does not have that potential. If so, it will not offer you much because the technology is still way too new and we're still mainly trying to use it as a replacement for credit cards, PayPal, etc.
However there are many "latent" features with huge potential, but not much tooling or active use (e.g., contracts). As the tooling gets built, it will gradually become "obvious" what Bitcoin's benefits really are.

One of the odd things about Bitcoin privacy is how it's a collective effort. One user whose privacy has been compromised can deanonymize a whole group of business partners who might prefer to remain private.

A private key is just a number chose from the range between 1 and ~10^77. If you and I use the same number, we can spend from the same pool of funds.
One solution is to randomly chose the number. That makes is practically impossible to choose the same private key as another user.

One way is to use A deterministic wallet to generate the addresses server-side.
The server would have a copy of a master public key, from which new payment addresses can be generated. It's not possible to generate any private keys from this information alone.
This means that even if your server were compromised, the attacker could not generate any private keys.
One wrinkle is if the attacker obtains any child private key, the master private key can be derived from the master public key:

There are two ways to broadcast transactions:

2. Indirectly talk to the Bitcoin network using a third party service such as Blockchain.info.
The paper refers to case (1).
Under case (2), the Bitcoin network never learns your IP address because Blockchain.info sends the transaction for you. Blockchain.info knows your IP address, but you can mask it by connecting through TOR.

Once you own Bitcoin, it's amazing how freely money can move. Buy and trade altcoins to your heart's content. Do altcoin arbitrage. Buy stocks, or things like LTBCoin. Invest in the Ethereum sale.

One thing all that regulation, process, and inconvenience buys is a measure of safety. Stick your money into any old bank and know that the FDIC will bail you out (or so we're told).

You're running TeamViewer and it looks like your system has been compromised. However, that doesn't necessarily mean this was the route of attack that swept your 40 BTC.
To know that, we'll need to know more about your wallet. That information is scattered over various posts on this thread. Here's what I gather:
- Wallet: Bitcoin Qt. Which version?
- Password: strong. Do you reuse any passwords?
- Did you ever run the wallet without encryption?
- Are you connected to any cloud backup services?
- Backups. How did you manage wallet backups? Were those backups encrypted? Where did you store them?
- Did you ever "import" a wallet private key to another wallet?
Consider carefully how much information you want to give here. The attacker could be watching and use that information against you if you're not careful. Consider not using your old computer or network until you've had a chance to re-establish it.

That part about the receiving side struck me as well.
There have been a few posts here from people trying to send money overseas and looking to Bitcoin as a solution. The results have rarely been encouraging.
For the most part, using Bitcoin for remittence requires the use of *two* currency exchanges. One exchange in the host country converts local currency to bitcoin. The second exchange in the receiving country converts bitcoin to local currency.
Taken together with intraday price volatility, and the need to master a technological learning curve, it's not hard to see why many might prefer to stick with Western Union.
Like any disruptive technology, Bitcoin has quite a bit of catching up in store to displace the incumbent.
@_date: 2014-06-19 01:29:54
Kudos for offering a solution, and an intriguing one at that.
However, it appears to be a solution to the wrong problem.
The risk to Bitcoin comes not necessarily from large, loosely affiliated pools of miners, but from tightly coordinated organizations, exactly the kind of operation that would be immune to the proposed solution.
Any such organization controlling a majority of the hash power can turn that slight computational advantage into a massive economic advantage, and from there a hashing monopoly:
If anything, pools provide a check on that power by allowing small operations to compete, driving up the cost of a monopoly takeover. Eliminate them, and it just makes the job of a single organization that much easier.

No. Furthermore, one bitcoin can be split up into 100,000,000 units, called satoshis.


Yes. Each address is paired with a private key. The address can be generated from the private key, so the only thing necessary to spend coins held at an address is the private key.


Many wallet programs make this possible either by inspecting the unencrypted wallet file or through some form of backup, but this varies a lot across programs.

To me it seems like an important distinction. But maybe it's not - I'm not sure.
Saving is an idea that's largely been forgotten by Americans. They've been forced into ever more risky investments by the relentless compound effect of inflation. Other factors have also played a role, but it's hard to justify "savings" given negative real returns.
Bitcoin offers another way - assuming its volatility can be tamed.
"Hoarding" is what inflationist seem eager to call saving. The idea that money could become more valuable over time is to them morally unjust. By using their term, we play their game to an extent.

The algorithm is roughly:
Given this piece of binary data (a candidate block), find a nonce, or small piece of data, that when appended to the block produces a double SHA 256 value below a predetermined threshold.
The SHA 256 function takes arbitrary data and makes an unpredictable, but reproducible, fixed length byte sequence. It's thought to be a one way function. The process of mining involves guessing a nonce, finding the double hash value, and checking if that value is below the threshold.
The idea was first proposed as a system called hashcash:
If you can turn a computational problem into a double SHA 256 problem, you can use old mining hardware productively. So far nobody has been able to do this.

That depends on how much money is involved, the level of experience of all parties, and the level of trust between them. You can trust someone to be honest without trusting them to properly secure a paper wallet, for example.


Maybe so - I wouldn't recommend my suggestion to a beginner to be sure.

Not exactly. The difference is that a paper wallet stores a single private key.
A single electrum seed can generate thousands of private keys or more. This is done deterministically, meaning that the Electrum installation and the computer running it can be wiped from existence at any time and your funds will still be safe.

From the BIP 38 documentation:


The printer has a problem: what receiving address should be printed on the card?
Knowing only the encrypted private key doesn't address the problem because there's no way to go from an encrypted private key to an address.
The printer could rely on you to report the correct address. But you might make a mistake, then later blame it on the printer.
The intermediate code lets you give the printer a single piece of information that enables them to reliably generate both pieces of information they need - the address *and* the encrypted private key.

How often would you plan on spending the donated bitcoin?
If you plan on letting the donations sit for awhile, you can get started by simply printing a piece of papers from this site:
The QR code marked "share" is what you can print on merchandise and equipment.  This is your address.
Keep the code and string of characters marked "secret" to yourself. You can eventually use this secret (private) key to spend funds from your address.
Notice that you can zoom that page a lot without pixelation. That would be a quick way to get the qr code printed.
Hold onto the paper printout. It's the only thing that will enable you to claim the funds when the time comes.
This is probably the easiest setup you can do. It's not the best, but it's quick. Hopefully easy to understand as well.

Mike makes the point that Web wallets require a server.
The main reason is that browsers can't directly communicate with the P2P network. The Bitcoin network uses TCP, which browsers don't use directly.
Browsers do support something like TCP, though, with Web RTC:
Web RTC makes direct peer-to-peer communication possible within the browser.
Has anyone looked into fitting Bitcoin nodes with a Web RTC channel, or alternatively in enabling web browsers to directly connect to the P2P network in some way?
I'm sure there would be security challenges to consider. What would they be, and what would be the biggest barrier (technical or otherwise) to working Web RTC support into Bitcoin Core, btcd, or BitcoinJ?

I'd be all to happy to be proven wrong about this - please do it. Here are my sources:




Finally, from the whitepaper itself:










Under the scenario I describe, p &lt; q, so qz = 1.
In other words, a majority cartel can build chains faster than the rest of the network. It can come back from any deficit given enough time. By privately mining and releasing blocks when needed, the majority cartel can undo the blocks of any other pool, and in so doing deny mining reward to the rest of the network. The network has no defense against this - it's the way the protocol works.
I am trying to join the latter group of people who understand the protocol. So far, none of them have given a compelling argument for why this scenario can't/won't happen given the current protocol.

Miners face a difficult problem: how to arrive at a single consensus view of the transaction history. They do this by agreeing to only build on the longest chain of blocks. Branches of equal length make this process take longer and open the door to double spending while unresolved.
So the key is to prevent long branches of equal length from forming in the first place.
Placing fewer transactions into each block means shortening the time between blocks. As this time window shortens, the probability that two or more miners will more or less simultaneously solve independent blocks increases. As this probability increases, so does the chance of creating a branch. With each passing time interval, the number of branches can multiply, leading each miner to have a slightly different view of the transaction history.
So, blocks contain multiple transaction to allow enough time to pass between blocks that a single clear longest chain can emerge.

Hardware isn't what would prevent this plan from working. It's the miners on the bitcoin network, who would reject any transactions coming from the VP network as invalid.
The original stake of 1 bitcoin would be irrelevant to establishing the VP network. Miners don't multiply the value of existing bitcoin. A block reward is issued. This is a ledger entry with no sender, and the receiver is the winning miner.

wallet that offers both: two-factor authentication and verification over a separate channel.

It's a good start, but incomplete. You've left out how funds will be spent. This is the part about paper wallets that's easy to miss.

Interesting point I hadn't considered before.
I want to make sure I understand. Merchants are afraid of accepting zero-confirmation transactions. So they work with a gateway (e.g., BitPay or GreenAddress) that does it for them. Eventually these wallet providers decide that they'll only accept payments from an "approved" wallet to minimize their fraud risk.
So even though nothing happens to single-sig, be-your-own-bank style wallets, they become useless for buying things.

The confirmation time represents a balance between fast transactions and preventing block chain forks. Both are necessary, but pull in opposite directions.
Forks are bad because as long as they're unresolved, double spending can occur.
The confirmation time needs to be slow enough that new blocks get fully propagated to all miners before a new block is found.

Bitcoin suffers from some unfortunate choices with respect to terminology. "Mining" is one of those terms that seemed like a good idea at the time, but has completely lost its utility and has even become counterproductive.
I prefer to change the discussion instead. Rather than talking about miners, I talk about "auditors". What are they auditing and why would they bother? This takes the discussion in a completely different direction that gets at why Bitcoin exists in the first place.
@_date: 2014-06-11 13:05:37
Arguments for why this isn't a problem go something like this: "miners won't work against their own self-interest." So double spends and DOS are off the table.
There's a far more ambiguous move GHash.IO (or any cartel) can take: form a monopoly. The process would be simple:
1. Gain &gt;50% of the network hashrate.
2. Deny any non-cartel pool from getting a block reward. This plan has a 100% chance of success, even with 50.5% of the hashrate.
3. Watch as miners, unable to make any money where they are, abandon every other pool, driving up cartel hash share far beyond 50%.
If left unchecked, this 3-step plan results in a benevolent mining monopoly: 
The monopoly doesn't double spend. It doesn't DOS. For all intents and purposes, it's a Good Guy - except one: no other pool gets block rewards.
This is a far more likely scenario than any of the core team, or other spokespeople in Bitcoin have addressed. No countermeasure I'm aware of can prevent it. The financial incentive is 100% aligned with the plan.
Gaining monopoly status is in every pool's financial interest.
So we're not talking about a group intent on "destroying Bitcoin". Rather, a group who sees so much value that they want to control it completely.

 address is used.
- Privacy. The credit card company knows everything you spend money on and may be selling this information to third parties. Bitcoin has its own issues around privacy, but they are different and in many issues allow the individual to decide how much information to reveal.
- Diversification. Given enough price appreciation, most people will become nervous and want to "cash out" to "lock in" profits.

It's an imperfect analogy at best, but you're on track when you say "if the person will accept pennies". The effort of finding a gas station that will accept pennies is analogous to waiting for a miner that will accept a zero-fee transaction with a lot of inputs.
You can always leave off the fee (or add a nominal one) and hope for the best.

Given the nature of the goods being sold, I think Coinbase could be a non-starter.
Coinbase requires linkage of the buyer's bank account number, followed by a day or two verification period, followed by another 4-5 business days for purchase.
Maybe that kind of scrutiny is what your customers will tolerate, but I'd be surprised.
Localbitcoins offers an alternative. Pay with cash with a teller at a bank. No meetup with seller and no bank account needed:
- exchange rate can be higher than elsewhere
- only available to US residents

MultiBit doesn't require you to download and verify the entire block chain. As a result, it loads in a fraction of the time. Here's a guide to using it:
That said, MultiBit has some quirks that make it hard to use by beginners. If you want a downloadable wallet, have a look at Electrum:
The main disadvantage of Electrum is that the Android app is not easy to install. That means you can't easily share the same wallet across all devices. In that case, Blockchain.info is the way to go.

Right, I meant Electrum.
It has a file called 'default_wallet', but it's considered better practice to backup your seed instead and not mess with this file. The only exception might be if you've imported addresses and want to maintain them, which nullifies a lot of the advantages of Electrum.
So it's really just the seed you need to secure. It sounds like you're worried about physical theft/damage and want to do backup with cloud storage.
This is problematic in that you'll need to encrypt the file with a strong password. Forgetting that password means you've lost your funds. However, you should only need one password, which might not be that bad.
An alternative might be Shamir's secret sharing, as implemented in something like PassGuardian:
Here, no password is needed. You split the seed into say 5 fragments and store them in separate (physical or virtual) locations. You need 3 fragments to re-generate the seed. An attacker needs to compromise at least three locations to take your funds, and you need no password.
Armory uses a similar concept called "fragmented backups":

Until a transaction appears in the block chain, it is said to be unconfirmed.
A transaction appearing in the most recent block is said to have one confirmation. A transaction appearing in the next most recent block has two confirmations. And so on.
A confirmed transaction can become unconfirmed. This happens when miners disagree about the block sequence. One way this can happen is if two miners happen to find a block at almost the same time.
This creates a branch that every miner needs to keep track of. Think of it as a fork in the road.
Some miners will decide to build on one side and others on the other side. The next solved block often decides. If that block builds, not on the block in which your transaction appears, but on the one in which it does not, your transaction will become unconfirmed.
The take home message is that transactions are never fully confirmed. The probability of being taken out of the block chain simply approaches, but never reaches, zero.

Yes, I think it's a brilliant name, actually.
Bitcoin is an electronic cash system. That doesn't mean it's some new-fangled money system. It literally means that Bitcoin works on a similar set of principles as the metal coins and paper bank notes in your pockets:
The centerpiece of this system is a digital "coin". A coin is a digital object with a face value. It can be given by one person to another. Once given, it can't be taken back. Like all cash transactions, Bitcoin transactions often generate change. Many beginning and even intermediate users skip the step of understanding this part. This leads to many, many misunderstandings.
Part of the problem is all of those images in the popular media depicting physical coins, which are simply novelty/collector item with little connection or value to Bitcoin itself.
It seems plausible that the "bit" part came from BitTorrent, from which Bitcoin draws many key ideas.
@_date: 2014-08-26 13:36:40


Yes. A stealth payment doesn't hide the sender or receiver any more than payment to an Electrum or Armory wallet does. In that sense, it's a misnomer that gives the impression of some extra level of privacy.
The only real advantage of a stealth payment is that you can publish a single receiving address, but receive payments to apparently random payment addresses.


It's more like the house at 123 Main St. has a magical teleportation mailbox. When packages are put into it, they appear in a seemingly random mailbox somewhere in the world. The shared secret Bob gives me tells me the address to find the package, and how to open the mailbox there.
This is a bad analogy because address means two different things. The stealth address is not like a Bitcoin address. It's more like a master public key in an Armory or Electrum Wallet.

Any new altcoin faces a big problem when it comes to security, specifically against a majority hashrate (51%) attack. A bank would be no different. So unless they were willing to launch the system with a massive up-front investment in hardware, it would be vulnerable and possibly stillborn. For example, Auroracoin faced this exact problem and didn't do too well:
The bigger issue is whether such a move would even be in a bank's best interest. I find it hard to come up with a compelling case for it.

SharedCoin is a service for doing this:

The ledger is unaffected by these mixing schemes and works as expected. Value is transferred as always.

It's always a possibility. In some ways, stealing bitcoin can be much more profitable than, say, stealing credit card info. That provides the motivation for the crooks out there. I'm sure what we've seen so far is just the beginning. A password protected account is helpful, but any program you run will execute with all of your privileges. If your MultiBit wallet is unencrypted, malware will be able to read it without a problem.
One way to lessen the risk is to store the majority of your funds offline (think savings account). Then the funds you use more often can be held in a hot wallet like MultiBit, and topped up as needed. Losing your hot wallet would be less of a problem (although still pretty annoying).

Sign a transaction and give it to the other person via QR code or NFC. If they trust you not to double spend, then there is no need to immediately post the transaction to the network.

It makes sense that nodes are free to relay whatever they want and miners are free to mine whatever they want. If a transaction with outputs below the dust limit gets mined, it's still valid and so the block will be accepted.
I guess I'm wondering what the sender of this transaction may have done differently than the senders of other transactions I've seen in which a sub-dust output was included and the transaction never confirmed.
In other words, is there a "trick" to getting a dust transaction confirmed?

Not exactly. A majority cartel (group with over 50%) can begin mining at a previous block. While mining these replacement blocks and maintaining majority status, they can:
- remove existing transactions
- delay those existing transactions from appearing in blocks
But the cartel can't forge transactions or create invalid blocks. These attempts will be rejected by honest nodes.
Any honest miner seeing the cartel's new blocks needs to build a branch of the block chain to accomodate them. After a certain number of blocks, this will "orphan" the honest miner's previous branch of the block chain.
At this point all transactions in the orphaned branch [will be returned to the "memory pool"]( from which they will be eventually processed, but slowly (point 2 above).

This system will get funds into an address. Many folks starting out with cold storage fail to think through how funds will be spent. Even if you plan to hold long term, increases in the exchange rate could motivate you to divide your funds over a few different addresses.

Public keys are pseudonyms. Within the network, Bitcoin users identify themselves with public keys only. An address is another form in which a public key can be expressed.
A public key is a randomly-generated pseudonym. Every payment sent or received through it is publicly and permanently recorded.


However, pieces of private information contaminate most of what you do online. If this private information is linked with your public transaction history, then the things you do with Bitcoin can be linked with your personal identity.
For example, when you use web wallets, your IP address and browser signature become available to the wallet operator unless you take steps to hide them. If you use an exchange like Coinbase, then you've leaked even more private information (bank account number, full legal name, etc.). If you post your address in a forum signature, you've publicly linked your address to another online identity, which could even be your legal name. And so on.
One part of Bitcoin privacy is ensuring that your public key(s) never become linked with any private information. It's a tall order.
One reason is that the mere act of transacting can reveal your identity. If we meet in person and you pay me, I can trace your financial history. Same thing if I pay you in person. If you're being sloppy about privacy, I can see how much bitcoin you own, and other information. If I'm a bad guy, I can come up with a plan to do bad things to you, such as rob you.
Privacy is for everyone.

Having answered a number of newbie questions over the last several months, I see a definite pattern (anti-pattern?).
Newbie wants to do X with Bitcoin, and only really cares about X - not Bitcoin as a whole, which seems like topic of infinite complexity. It seems like X should be simple to do, but it turns out not to be. Read this long guide, sift through this long video, endure this long explanation. Few people have the time or patience for that.
Mature technologies have the luxury of giving users a simple way to do X. Push the power button and you're good to go.
Bitcoin is not a mature technology. Moreover, Bitcoin deals with money, not cat picture discussions. Bringing money and complexity together is a recipe for a lot of confusion and frustration.

I'm not sure about the security side of this, but I am curious about how you see this working for the user.
Would a user simply be able to enter a passphrase/pin to spend funds, or would the process need to be more complicated than that?
Also, could this method reveal a the multisig address without requiring the user to enter both the passphrase and pin?

Deep inside Bitcoin is the idea of a chain of coin ownership. The idea is that if you give me a coin, I get a history of all previous owners. Each owner digitally signs a transaction giving the coin to someone else. It's a little like provenance for a piece of art:
I can verify every single signature in the chain of ownership all the way back to the issuing authority (the network itself) to ensure you're not giving me a bogus coin.
This could be replaced, but everything in Bitcoin is built around this idea. It wouldn't be Bitcoin anymore. Kind of like replacing every component in a computer system with something else.


What's at stake isn't consensus, which has to do with resolving forks in the block chain. What's at stake is the ability of a payee to tell a bogus coin from a real coin.
That said, the creator of Ethereum did mention that it does away with the idea of coins and uses a system similar to what you describe. There may be others as well, but I haven't checked into any of this yet.

In a sense, I suppose. But a newspaper can expand the number of column inches to accommodate every buyer. Bitcoin doesn't do that.
An analogy more closely tied to how Bitcoin actually works is electronic cash. Everyone has used cash and can understand how it works. Bitcoin is an electronic version of cash.
This doesn't mean that Bitcoin is some new-fangled payment system. It literally means that Bitcoin works like an electronic version of the cash in your wallet.
Bitcoin users acquire digital tokens from other users, and give them to other users. These tokens are protected cryptographically against forgery. The Bitcoin network exists to prevent these tokens from being spent multiple times.

Bitcoin is the latest in a long line of attempts to solve the double spending problem inherent in electronic cash systems. All previous attempts ended as failures.
The reason: a centralized mint is easy to find and shut down.
Bitcoin took a radical approach that replaced the central mint with an open system in which anyone could offer their services as a mint. We call these folks miners, but a better name is "auditors".
For this decentralized system to work, there can be no central ledger. The price we pay for decentralization is confirmation time. It's a fundamental component of Satoshi's double spending solution.

Bitcoin Core is creating a new private key, which is used to create a new address. Here's more:


Imagine you post one of your addresses to a public social network account linked to your name. That's one way.
Now imagine that one of your payers does the same and pays you. If your payer has been de-anonymized and you are known to be one of his contacts, his payment to you could be used to de-anonymize you as well.
In other words, de-anonymization usually requires both the blockchain and information derived from other sources.

One question: Description says deterministic wallet. One of the reasons to use such a wallet is better privacy.
Specifically, deterministic wallets can only do their job well when a new address is given for every received payment.
Hive showed me the same receiving address repeatedly, and allowed multiple payments to be sent to it. Then the receiving address changed. This didn't seem to be connected to logging out and then back in. It's not clear what triggered the change.
Why isn't a new receiving address consistently shown every time the user attempts to accept a payment?

The Bitcoin network's main purpose is to protect against double spending fraud. This is something the payee cares a lot about but the payer doesn't care about.

Blockchain.info lets you tag a transaction with a public message, but the message is *not* in the blockchain - it merely exists on the blockchain.info website.
A special transaction type that uses the OP_RETURN command was recently made standard:
This lets you associate 40 bytes of data with a transaction, but the output is un-spendable. This has been controversial with miners. It's not clear to me how to get one of these transaction into the block chain:

There's a limit to what a 51% attacker can do:
- Reverse transactions that he sends while he's in control. This has the potential to double-spend transactions that previously had already been seen in the block chain.
- Prevent some or all transactions from gaining any confirmations
- Prevent some or all other miners from mining any valid blocks
As others have noted, the cartel would probably quickly fall apart quickly. Several weeks back a pool began to approach 51% and the entire front page was filled with warnings to join other pools.

Not quite.
Each "coin" has a unique ID. For example, this randomly-chosen transaction:

This ID is based on the transaction's "hash value". Individual coins are defined as "outputs" on the transaction (right-hand side of the linked page). These outputs are given 0-based indices. So the first coin is index 0 and the second is 1.
I can refer to the coin paid to address 1Cn8Pj51BGgiKbdLwVoGqFERXKC9qXBEGa as output 0 of transaction 4c6992a157ee78d9bb9abf75176adf70295d9de662f10e2e05ca01ef4a8ce0a5.

It really depends on your level of concern over the funds that will be stored with the paper wallet.
For example, if just experimenting with a few bucks' worth, security will just get in the way. (Practicing several times adding and withdrawing a trivial amount of money from a paper wallet will help you learn much quicker). However, if you're putting a significant percentage of assets into a paper wallet, you'll want to be very careful.

The main problem is keeping funds safe. Bitcoin has shined a light into a very dark part of the internet and shown us how badly secured most PCs are.
The good news is there is an effective way to deal with the problem - cold storage:
The bad news is that it's not easy for most people to do right. Near the end the article talks about multisig, which is promising, but not yet widespread.
The other problem is conversion to and from fiat. This is an evolving story as well, and the future looks bright. The present still has problems.
To deal with both problems simultaneously, some recommend Coinbase. The problem is that if you were to pay your landlord with Coinbase* - you wouldn't be using Bitcoin at all. The entire transaction would happen off the blockchain chain - just like PayPal. Should something happen to Coinbase (theft, embezzlement, government crackdown, etc), there goes the payment. Still, it is an option.
Edit: * assuming you and landlord each used your Coinbase accounts.

It does seem contradictory.
First, the core protocol doesn't use encryption. It uses crypotgraphic signatures. This is a form of authentication without trusted third parties. In other words, Bitcoin's use of signatures prevents me from spending your coins.
The Bitcoin network itself actually solves a different problem. Even though you might authorize a payment to me with a valid signature, how do I know you haven't already spent the coin you say you're transferring?
Addressing that problem is the purpose of the Bitcoin network. It's important to understand Bitcoin's cash-like nature before this really makes any sense:


Yes, an invalid transaction can be broadcast. If it uses invalid signatures, it will be ignored by the network.

@_date: 2014-08-25 17:38:28
Not quite sure what you'd like to accomplish.
If you want an address that can't be traced to you, simply generate one. Assuming you've taken proper care, nobody will know about it.
Now, when you give this address to someone to accept payment, that's when you unmask yourself to an extent. Your payer can link your identity (if known) to an address. When you redeem a payment sent to you, you create a link to another address.
There is no way around this. Stealth payments don't solve the problem. HD wallets don't solve the problem.
Mixers and CoinJoin can help, but have limitations.

Double spending might be an option, but only if you really know what you're doing.
Use a tool that will allow you to create a raw transaction. You'll need to spend exactly the same output as your 0-fee transaction. When a miner picks up this new transaction, your 0-fee transaction will be dropped as a double spend.
I haven't tried it, but this might work:
Again, only do this if you understand the risks. You could lose the 1.4 BTC at the sending address if you make a mistake. The ~~problem~~ stuck transaction will eventually resolve itself if you do nothing. Be sure to check blockr.io because blockchain.info tends to sequester 0-fee transactions for some reason.

MultiBit defaults to using a single address for all incoming and outgoing payments. If you haven't manually added any addresses and you haven't imported any paper wallets, then your wallet should contain only a single address/private key.
If you haven't changed anything from December, then your backup should contain the private key you'll need to restore your funds.
If you have any doubts about how to do this, ask first.
Edit: and just in case (you may know this already, so don't take offense) don't post your private key here.

Bitcoin addresses, like hypodermic needles, are supposed to be disposable. Use them once and safely dispose of them. The main reason is privacy. There's more on this topic here:
However, it's extremely useful to be able to publish a single address and receive multiple payments to it. One of the main uses is donations and tips, where implementing a full-blown payment solution is too costly.
A stealth address gives the best of both worlds. A single address is published, while supporting privacy for payer and payee.
The process is exceedingly complex, but in a nutshell works like an inverted deterministic key pool. The payer determines the offset and conveys it to the payee using "Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellman" and a feature of Bitcoin's built-in programming language called OP_RETURN. More on OP_RETURN is here:
I've yet to see an approachable, non-expert discussion of how stealth addresses work, but have attempted to include one in my upcoming book:

Let's imagine that Ghash blackmails Gavin Andresen into releasing a new reference node that increases the mining reward to 50 BTC and keeps it there indefinitely.
This would be visible to the entire community because the source code (and changes made to it) are easily found and monitored:
The first thing would happen would be a storm of protests on every online forum related to cryptocurrency. For example, witness the firestorm that erupted when the Dogecoin developers had the audacity to merely *not* change the way the code works:
Let's assume the miners went along with the plan (after all, who doesn't want to make more money)?
The next thing that would happen is that everyone who had up to this point viewed Bitcoin as a long-term store of value would begin looking for the exists. The value would crumble, and a replacement would quickly arise from the mayhem. A new fork of the Bitcoin source code restoring the old money growth algorithm would be released.
tl;dr Bitcoin is open in every sense of the word. This makes it very difficult to cover up attempts to mess around with the code base.

This is sad, sorry to hear about it. In the interest in figuring out what might have happened:


At this point, your private key was *shared* between both the Blockchain.info wallet and the Qt wallet.
This is very bad as it compromises both the security and integrity of both wallets.
If your Qt wallet wasn't encrypted, or had a weak password, then any attacker could have stolen your funds through a run of the mill exploit such as those deployed in Java applets - just by looking for a wallet.dat file on your hard drive.
The Blockchain.info wallet could have been secured with a strong password and 2FA, and it wouldn't have made any difference because a private key was being shared between two wallets.
Far better to sweep the private key.
Not only that, you you'd have to watch out for change addresses if you used Qt. What appeared to be a theft could simply be the result of Qt sending change into the next change address:
So one thing to be absolutely sure of: does your Qt wallet contain the funds?

I think the uncertainty comes from how gains are realized and treated.
Bob buys 1 bitcoin for $100 dollars. One year later he buys a big screen tv (worth $1000) for the same bitcoin from Overstock.
How does Bob figure the tax he owes on the gain? What's his tax rate (long term capital gain or regular income?). Is Bob taxed at all on a gain realized through a Bitcoin purchase?
If Bob had realized the same gain while holding Euro bills and visiting Europe, there would be no tax on the gain.
I'm less concerned  about paying the tax than I am about having to keep a record of literally everything I buy with bitcoin, my cost basis for the spent coins, and the exchange rate at the time I made the purchase. That simply isn't practical, especially as Bitcoin payment options multiply.

- The monopoly would have enormous resources at its disposal to secure the network and develop the protocol.

One of the interesting things about Bitcoin is how it enables companies to think differently about their business model.
Netflix's current model is based on recurring credit card payments working pretty well while pay-per-view is much more problematic.
Bitcoin could allow Netflix to experiment with completely new business models. One obvious test case could be pay-per-view for infrequent/one-time users. Micropayments could be another.
Edit: by "pay-per-view", I'm talking about someone who doesn't currently have a Netflix subscription and who either can't or won't use a credit card online. So there's no prior relationship between the potential customer and Netflix and there's no other way for Netflix to acquire that customer.

The sender attaches a signature, which can be constructed from two pieces of information:
- the transaction 
- the private key
Using the transaction and private key, the sender encodes a verification code into the signature.
The receiver uses the transaction, signature, and sender's public key to re-create the verification code.
If the verification codes match, the signature is valid. Otherwise, the signature is invalid.
The procedure used by the sender to reconstruct the verification code can't reveal the private key, with one important exception. But that's an advanced topic.

The concepts are confusing, so it's important to get the terminology right.
A wallet can hold multiple *private keys*. From each private key, it's possible to generate one *public key*. An *address* is derived from a public key. Put differently:
private key -&gt; public key -&gt; address
See this for more:
There is one wrinkle in that public keys can be either compressed or uncompressed. A compressed public key will generate a different address than an uncompressed public key. Both forms are valid. Funds from either address can be spent using the same private key.
Things can get even more complicated with multisignature addresses. In principle, you can generate many addresses all linked to the same private key.

You could reveal the script that gives the hash, but this is flimsy evidence. When you redeem from a P2SH address, you need to reveal the script. So the "proof" can be found on the block chain itself, potentially.
The redemption script (the hashed script) itself need not contain any public keys, or even be valid for that matter. It could be gibberish. So there's not even necessarily a link to any public keys.
As I understand the question, you'd like to know of a way to prove control of a P2SH address without spending funds. I think the answer is that there is no way to do that.
You might be able to do something clever with the redemption script. Gavin confirmed that a recent change opened up all white listed opcodes for use in P2SH scripts:
You might be able to write into the redemption script some kind of cryptographic proof that only you could generate. I'm not sure, though.

As the example of buying a tank of gas with pennies demonstrates, this isn't exactly true. Some merchants will refuse payment in change, even though coins are just as much legal tender as dollar bills.
Here are some more imperfect examples:
- try buying a new car with pennies
- some gas stations don't accept cash (e.g., Costco)
- some stores won't accept $100 bills
- some toll booths won't accept $1 or 50 cent coins
What all of these examples have in common is that the form the physical money takes has an effect on the practicality of the transaction.
Likewise, the form your Bitcoin funds take (single large input vs. many small inputs) will affect the practicality of certain kinds of transactions.

Ah, that's a much easier problem. Mycelium needs to support sending change to a new paper wallet. It doesn't, but this is a major oversight, IMO.


Often the address gets re-used. The tooling around withdrawing from a paper wallet is very, very primitive.

Given that you say that your receiving addresses are "completely different", my only hypothesis at this point is:

There's no need to hold it after you buy. Sell (or spend) it immediately if you want.
The problem with never buying even a small amount is that it limits your understanding and the kinds of questions you'll come up with.
Concern 1) never resonated with me. Few people who use Android know (or care) who Linus Torvalds is or what he believes in.
Concern 2) is valid and you should be concerned about it. It's also widely recognized and was even laid out in Satoshi's paper. There have been altcoins that have suffered this attack. Some bounced back, others didn't. There are lessons there, as well as [proposals]( to address it.
Concern 3) is the result of Bitcoin's tiny market cap at the moment. It shouldn't matter if you immediately sell after buying.
You might add one more concern:
4) The blockchain is large and growing exponentially. At the current rate it won't be long before only high-end systems can even act as a full node. As it stands, processing time severely limits the ability of casual users to even run a full node. And forget about mining. This serves to concentrate control of hash power into ever fewer hands.

A bitcoin can be divided into 100,000,000 units called "satoshis". There are currently ~1,350,000,000,000,000 satoshis in circulation, or ~1.35 quadrillion. That's enough for each person on Earth to have ~193,000 satoshis.
So any payment you send or receive can either be expressed in "bitcoin" or in "satoshis", depending on the situation.
If need be, value can be split even more finely by an update to the protocol.
The best way to understand is to actually work with smaller valued Bitcoin transactions.

It depends on how you encode the information. For example, you can encode it in 64-byte chunks representing public keys within a pay to public key output (P2PK). You can add dozens of these outputs to a single transaction. Concatenating the public keys regenerates the data you wanted to encode.
Doing this forces the outputs into the UTXO set, which is a size-constrained list of spendable outputs.
The preferred method is to add 40-bytes of OP_RETURN data:
Such an output can be pruned from the UTXO set, keeping the network efficient. Multiple OP_RETURN outputs can be added to a single transaction.
Blockchain.info allows you to attach notes to a transaction, however, this information is not included in the block chain and usually isn't read by any other wallet.

Compressed keys are part of the ECDSA (elliptic curve) standard. Bitcoin uses that standard, and so compressed public keys are part of the deal.


Because an address is derived from a public key. A compressed key is 33 bytes, but uncompressed is 65 bytes. The procedure that creates an address from the public key changes even if one minor detail in the public key changes.
Both addresses are associated with the same private key, though.

Regarding contracts, one thing you both may be interested in is ensuring that the other can access funds in the event of death.
The easiest thing to do on that front would be to set up a multisig 1 of 2 address for daily spending.
However, for savings, you'd probably want that to be a 2 of 2. The problem is that should one of you die, the funds will be locked forever. So you need a way to ensure that the surviving spouse can recover the funds.
You could do that with a contract. This page gives the example of a will:

Why mask anything? Why not announce the plan from day one - or at least make it be known gradually over time? The last thing the monopoly would want to do is surprise users - that could cause a panic which would be bad for business. Better to slowly get all users comfortable with the idea that a good strongman will be running the show - eventually. It could take years, but not all businesspeople are short-sighted.


Now it seems like we're talking about two very different things. The majority cartel would never engage in double spending - ever. All transactions would continue to be processed. The majority cartel might even specifically target "unethical" mining pools by prioritizing the reversal of their blocks and in so doing deny them of any block rewards.

The Bitcoin Foundation is actually a centralized solution that many Bitcoin users see as a contradiction. In fact, a lot of money was recently paid out for a system that could replace the foundation with software and collective action:

When using a wallet, it seems that Bitcoin is a payment system that works with accounts and balances. It doesn't work anything like that.
Bitcoin is an electronic cash system. This doesn't mean that it's a system that replaces cash. It means that the way Bitcoin works is very similar to the way that cash works:
The main purpose of the Bitcoin network is to protect payees from double spending fraud (the last section in the link). The only way to do this is for payees to know about all transactions.
That said, the block chain can be "pruned" to reduce storage and bandwidth requirements:

If you receive a large number of small payments and attempt to spend them in a single transaction, the fee can easily exceed the payment itself.
The single biggest contributor to transaction fees is the number payments you're redeeming.
Mining and faucet-hopping tend to lead to lots of small payments, and it sometimes comes as a shock that way more than 0.1 or 0.2 mBTC will be needed to spend it. The link has more info on why this is the case.

On the positive side, here's a non-expert trying to come to grips with Bitcoin. Main points include:
- Bitcoin has value because people want to use it.
- Mt. Gox
- Legal issues, regulation
- Volatility in exchange rate
- Think of it more as an "investment"
- We might "run out of new Bitcoins"
- Individuals will have the power to make monetary policy for the entire Bitcoin market by either hoarding or spending.
- It's like investing in fine wine or musical instruments or paintings.
In other words, this video reiterates the same kinds of misinformation and price-fixation as almost every other popular press piece on Bitcoin. Like other self-described "economists", Altman shows little understanding of Bitcoin itself or Bitcoin economics.
This is a window into how general audiences in Western countries see Bitcoin.
When you talk to someone who has heard about Bitcoin through the mass media, remember, their first thoughts are "scam" and "get-rich-quick scheme". This video reveals the origins of these thoughts perfectly.

Yes. All valid transactions are added to the block chain. This means that any payment to your cold storage address is public.
There are two concepts to keep in mind: security and privacy. Security keeps your funds from being stolen by someone who gets ahold of your private key.
Privacy keeps your identity from being linked to a public key or address. Sometimes a privacy leak can lead to a security problem. For example, you pay someone from an address with thousands of bitcoin. That person suddenly becomes very interested in everything you do, wanting to find ways to steal from you.

Am I correct in thinking that mini-blockchain also does away with the need to handle transaction change?

That's the problem. One cent will always be worth 1/100 of a dollar. Just like a millibit will always be worth 1/1000 of a bitcoin. The millibit will never be more or less valuable than 1/1000 of a bitcoin.

Edit: also see my response to If you were to create a fork of the block chain and run your own bitcoin network, transactions would never be possible directly between the two networks.

That could be an issue to consider. MultiBit makes it easy to accidentally close a wallet without realizing what happened. The next time you open MultiBit - poof - money seems to have vanished.
Search your system hard drive for a file with the .wallet extension. If something turns up you didn't expect to see, that could be your missing wallet.
These files are often stored in the default location:
but can be accidentally saved elsewhere.


Maybe knowing the wallet from which the transaction was sent could help.
Your transaction lists multiple inputs and outputs. All the inputs come from a different address:
On a stock MultiBit installation, that's not possible. This wallet only uses a single private key/address combination. So unless you imported private keys (not a good idea), the payment didn't come from MultiBit.
Multiple outputs aren't supported by very many wallets. The ones that come to mind are: Bitcoin Core; Electrum; Blockchain.info and Armory. Does any of this help jog your memory of which wallet sent the transaction?
Finally, that output containing 10.09 BTC could be linked to a change address:
Paper wallets and change addresses are well within the danger zone, especially if paper wallets are imported into MultiBit or other software wallets. Did you do this?
Finally, mistakes happen and Bitcoin is very unforgiving. Has happened to me a few times, and I've seen countless discussions here and elsewhere. Keep cool and try to retrace your steps.

It's something people are working on, but will take some time.
People would really like a hardware wallet that lets them spend at physical merchants. Although hardware wallets get part of the way there by signing transactions and not exposing private keys, they fail IMO in getting the transaction to the merchant.

A private key is a number. A public key is a point on a 2d curve.
To get the public key, multiply the private key by a predefined generator point. The process does not work in the opposite direction. In other words, you can only derive the private key from a public key through brute force.

In that case, you might want to double-check with the license on Blockchain.info's code (I wasn't able to see one).
Any code released by any person or company is by default protected by copyright (in the US and many other countries). Just because it's on the Web doesn't mean it can be forked and re-released. Blockchain's license will determine your rights around the code - including your rights to re-mix into your own programs. In the absence of a license, your rights are very limited.

Mining is generally considered unprofitable when current exchange rates, cost of hardware, and cost of equipment are factored in.
The exception is high-end gear costing thousands or more. Faster hardware is constantly enteringt eh market and gets bid up to very high levels very quickly. Product stocks of the best equipment are depleted very quickly.
It's hardly free money. You're risking the loss of your entire investment that could be caused by a downward spike in bitcoin price price, or an upward spike in mining difficulty (caused by more powerful miners joining the network).
The probability of a single miner having the power to mine a block in a reasonable amount of time is very, very low.

This article takes the same position as so many others - Bitcoin won't succeed until more merchants start to accept it. Few do today, ergo failure.

Starting right away with mining makes understanding Bitcoin difficult. Yet this is where most people want to start. It makes sense, I suppose. Money out of thin air is always fascinating.
It might help to step back a bit and try to answer the question for yourself - why does the Bitcoin network need to exist in the first place?
Here's a high-level answer to that question (spoiler - it's to solve the double spending problem):

The coins are gone without a private key to the address they were sent to.

Great question that I asked myself many times. I'm working on a post to answer it. In the meantime, maybe this will be helpful.
Given the problems with change addresses, you'd think there should be a way to eliminate them:
Bitcoin is an electronic cash system, according to Satoshi himself. It's easy to brush this term aside and assume that what Satoshi meant was that his system replaces cash with some kind of payment system.
That's not what he meant at all. He meant that Bitcoin actually works and acts like physical cash:
Like all cash systems, Bitcoin uses tokens with fixed face value. Parties give and receive these tokens to make payments. Your wallet tries to hide this from you and in so doing causes much confusion about what's going on underneath.
Bitcoin is so similar to cash that it replicates the need most cash transactions have to return change. That change must be claimed in a change address or be lost as a miner fee.
The idea of cash is deeply embedded in Bitcoin. It can't be taken out, only disguised.
edit: here's the post:
@_date: 2014-07-25 20:43:59
Unless the protocol changes, Bitcoin will have to settle for success on these fronts:
- payments will be confined to being accepted outside of brick and mortar stores
- brick and mortar payments will be mediated by a trusted third party willing to accept the zero confirmation double spend risk
The direction things are headed in points to the second path.

Very much so.
The whole idea behind the complex topic of cold storage is this: You can't trust a network connected computer with private keys. So stop trying.
The rather elaborate procedure in the linked article is designed to keep private keys from touching a network connected device. Note that just pulling the network cable isn't good enough because malware can work just fine with only intermittent connectivity.
That said, there's no harm in practicing with small amounts using a network connected computer. However, to be sure, you'll need a plan to keep those private keys from potentially touching the network.

It's actually very easy to do if you're not generating your private keys randomly.
A private key is just an integer in the range from 1 to ~10^77. You might decide the number 1 is easy to remember, so choose that as your private key. 
It turns out that other people have come to the same conclusion and chosen the same private key, moved funds in - only to have them moved right back out. See this for more:
Similar considerations apply with brain wallets. When someone says a brain wallet was "hacked", what they really mean is that someone else was able to guess some data that when hashed produced the same private key as the one in use by someone else.
If your private key is generated with a faulty random number generator, then the likelihood of collision goes up - sometimes dramatically. So this is one reason you might hear about random number generators in connection with bitcoin security.
@_date: 2014-10-17 19:33:54

@_date: 2014-10-07 13:57:11


Even if a merchant accepted multiple coins instead of just one, the merchant would be able to make the connection. If the merchant is using BitPay, then BitPay can link the coins.
So any privacy-enhancement must be done _before_ your payment to the BitPay merchant.
In short, multi-input transactions combined with centralized exchanges and payment processors pose a major privacy threat that isn't yet widely-perceived as such. Tools both for detecting the possibility of a multi-input transaction and for preventing it from occurring are lacking.

The consumer use case has not yet been invented. Finding it might be a huge opportunity or a complete waste of time and effort.
There's a lot of interest in transferring the current consumer experience with credit cards to Bitcoin, and that may be a mistake. Consumers in Western countries are overserved by credit cards and so will continue to see little reason to adopt Bitcoin.
Bitcoin has a different set of strengths and weaknesses than credit cards. Winners in this game will embrace those differences.

Maybe you're right - I'm not sure where the misconception is here, so I picked the one that seems to come up a lot.


I don't see how owning bitcoin is relevant or required for the establishment of an altcoin in any way.
Let's try that again, just in case:


Mining brings new bitcoin into existence, it doesn't generate new bitcoin from old. A brand new entry on the ledger is created with no sender. Transaction fees are also paid, but that just skims existing bitcoin from one address to another.
Anyone is free to set up their own altcoin, and hundreds have. Nobody gave them permission, and no stake in either Bitcoin or another altcoin was necessary. These are all completely separate projects with their own independent blockchains.
You could create an altcoin that forks the Bitcoin blockchain, but that project would quickly become distinct as the main block chain advanced. Transactions made on the fork would not be respected by the main block chain, and vice versa.

It could be a way to make money that doesn't yet exist.
The banked already have everything they think they need when it comes to online and offline payments (except privacy and security, but I digress).

Before using Armory for cold storage, it's essential that you create an unencrypted backup of your seed. This seed is the only thing you'll need to restore a wallet in the event you laptop dies.
The seed can be printed onto a sheet of paper and stored in a secure location. It can be also stored on a USB drive or other medium, provided you trust it not to fail.
There's no need to make copies of the files used by armory.

I have to say this was one of the more confusing announcements I can recall.
The Coindesk article makes it clear that what was reduced was not so much a fee as a cutoff to allow your transaction to be propagated. If the fee doesn't meet the cutoff, miners won't relay it. But simply propagating the transaction does not give the miner the fee, of course. This cutoff is designed to prevent DoS attacks.
The fee that matters to most payees was not changed, apparently, and stands as it did before:

I'm not sure what that might do to your resource consumption (memory, disk space, etc.), so you might want to check that. However, in principle this would work.

You got it. Also, yor seed needs to be protected from eavesdroppers when you spend.


Wallets are moving in that direction for the reasons you mention. It's BIP 32, but there are other specs as well that define how the seed mnemonic is generated and how individual private keys are created.


No. You can simply use one wallet. A good hd wallet should generate a new receiving address for every payment and change. Privacy is a big topic in Bitcoin. Here's one place to start:
@_date: 2014-12-11 18:58:50


Don't start with mining. The term is counterproductive because it obscures what the job actually entails. Transactions are being audited. For this reason I favor the term "auditor". The block reward is how auditors are compensated, but it will eventually disappear.
But don't start with auditors, either.
Instead, start with electronic cash. The ideas of electronic cash permeate Bitcoin all the way down to the source code itself.
We need auditors because of double spending. That's what the auditors are doing - preventing double spending fraud. Double spending risk follows directly from the fact that Bitcoin is an electronic cash system.

It takes guts to play this game.
@_date: 2014-08-25 20:13:42
Not quite. This is an ordinary transaction:
Notice how we can see that the stealth payment is spent and where it ended up. However, the Stealth Address has made something possible that was previously impossible:
A payee can publish a single stealth address, yet receive payments through many randomly-generated payment addresses. It's as if the payee was running a hierarchical wallet (like Electrum or Armory), but the payer could generate addresses on behalf of the payee, without learning the private keys to any of them.
This happens through something called Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellman exchange (ECDH). The payer transmits to the payee a shared secret with which the payee can generate the private key for the payment address. This information can be communicated out of band (e.g., via email). As a fallback, the shared secret also appears as OP_RETURN data, which is how blockchain.info identifies the transaction as a stealth payment.
Receiving payments through disposable (single-use) addresses is an important part of maintaining privacy when using Bitcoin, but it does not guarantee privacy.
@_date: 2014-09-12 03:22:55
Interesting problem.
To make sure I understand, you want to trigger a Bitcoin wallet to send a payment based on receiving a confirmed signup to a newsletter (or subscription).
It looks like Coinbase offers the API call you'd need:
All you'd need to do is get your email list service to send an HTTP post request in response to a confirmed signup. Unless Zapier handles your email list, you should be able to do this part without them given something like MailChimp.

From what I can tell, ASIC was a one-time quantum leap that resulted in a vastly superior mining platform. Getting into that platform was expensive and unreliable.

I think it's great that you're thinking about this and proposing solutions.


Three thoughts:
1. Clueful players will have priced the halving into their calculations long beforehand.
2. Halving the block reward cuts the rate of money creation which, all other things being equal, will drive up the exchange rate of existing coins. It's very likely that the exchange rate will respond before this happens.
3. Even assuming that that no price or difficulty adjustment takes place before the halving, it will produce the same overall effect on each miner's subsidy as one difficulty doubling, which has been happening routinely once every month for many months now.

Your friends are right in the sense that the customer is always right. Bitcoin is not for them right now.
Bitcoin is for those cases in which credit cards are not an option or are too top heavy. These include off the record types of purchases, thus the deluge of stories about Bitcoin and the black market.
But if you look a little further, you'll find more mundane situations as well. For example, online purchases of digital goods with credit cards are very invasive. The merchant has no business knowing my identity or obtaining the means to defraud me when all I'm receiving is a digital download or pay per view. Bitcoin offers a clean solution.
For this reason, I worry that attempts to introduce Bitcoin into brick and mortar settings will backfire. Credit cards work pretty well in those settings. After the initial excitement dies down, the merchant needs to support something separate from the rest of their POS, which can be expensive. It becomes a blight.

- Did you get physical access to his computer to check?
- What OS and version of MultiBit is he running?
- Did he give you private keys and/or address?
- What's the current state of the wallet?
- Did your client ever try to "share" his wallet among two or more computers?
Most importantly, what other addresses are on the MultiBit wallet?
Details can mean the difference between figuring this out and not.

Unlike credit cards that charge fees based on the amount of money sent, Bitcoin charges fees based on the amount of **data** sent.
The biggest factor adding data to a transaction is the number of  "coins" (aka "unspent outputs") you're claiming.
Bitcoin doesn't work like a credit card. It works like electronic cash. In physical cash systems, metal coins and banknotes with a fixed face value are traded. You don't pay for a Big Gulp at a 7-Eleven with $3.98, you pull out a $5 bill and hand it to the cashier. Similar idea with Bitcoin.
Bitcoin replaces these physical tokens with digital tokens. When you accept payment, you're accepting (usually) one digital coin. When you make a payment, you're giving this coin to someone else.
Understanding Bitcoin as a cash system is important not just to understand transaction fees, but for a number of other reasons as well.
The more coins you spend in a transaction, the more data must be sent (just like adding paragraphs to an email increases its size). More data means a higher fee, but there's a bit more to it than that.
Some transactions spending "old" coins qualify for a fee waiver.
Technical details are here:

Maybe not at first glance. But ask anyone who has puzzled over whether their wallet is about to do the right thing with fees or not. Ask anyone who has had a fee stuck because of insufficient transaction fee.
Or just ask ten random users to explain fees to you and count the number of correct responses.
It's a usability issue. If Bitcoin is to move beyond the phase of subsidy and toward self sufficiency, fees have to work on an economic and usability level.

Change addresses mainly become a problem when:
1. You assume Bitcoin transactions work like credit card payments.
2. You externalize private keys/addresses by, for example, backing up or monitoring with external tools.
3. You internalize external private keys/addresses by importing or sweeping.
4. Your wallet works in such a way as to make 1-3 relevant in a particular situation.
Unfortunately, 1-4 are easy criteria to meet for many beginners. These unfortunate cases have been reported on and pretty regularly. That's the reason I decided to write the article.
As far as change addresses being part of the protocol, I think  is right - they're implicit in the sense that unspent outputs are collected by miners and few are so generous as to give all their change away.

This wouldn't be regarded as cold storage by many users.
The idea behind cold storage is that the network-connected PC by its very nature is insecure. The only way to use it securely to generate or use private keys is to pull the network plug and never connect it.
Live Linux boot disks can be used here, but they should be deliberately disconnected from the network.
You don't need blockchain.info to generate a private key. There are many ways to do this, here's one:

You'll want some basic background info on private keys and their relationship to addresses. Here's one source:
A public key is a 2D point on an elliptic curve. This point has x- and y-coordinates. Each coordinate requires 32 bytes, a really big number.
It turns out that cryptographic elliptic curves have a horizontal plane of symmetry. They're the same on the top and on the bottom. So the y-coordinate is actually not necessary. As long as I know if the point is above of below the plane, I can re-generate the y-coordinate.
It's not mathematically convenient to work with separate x- and y-coordinates, so they're concatenated together, giving a single, larger number.
An uncompressed public key uses both coordinates. That gives 2\*32 = 64 bytes. An extra byte is tacked onto the beginning to indicate that both coordinates are being used. This gives 1 + 2\*32 = 65 bytes. When written in "hex" form, this requires 2\*65 = 130 characters.
A compressed public key uses only the x-coordinate. That gives 1\*32 = 32 bytes. An extra byte is tacked onto the beginning, and indicates whether the point is above or below the plane of symmetry. This gives 1 + 32 = 33 bytes. When written in hex form, this requires 2\*33 = 66 characters.
Compressed public keys can save you money in fees. Signing a transaction with a compressed public key makes a smaller (in terms of data) transaction. Fees are based on data size, so compressed public keys can reduce transaction fees:
Addresses are derived from public keys. The conversion is one-way.
Hex is a number system based on the number 16. For example, the decimal number 10 is written "a" in hex. The number 15 is "f". The number 255 is "ff".

Shorter confirmation times raise the risk of creating forks because the likelihood increases of a second miner broadcasting a block before the first one has been fully propagated.
Branches are bad because as they grow without resolving, the chance of an attacker being able to successfully pull off a double spend increases.
That said, the 10-minute confirmation time was chosen way before it was clear what the best number would be.
One advantage of accepting more blocks in a shorter time is that it makes solo mining feasible for smaller miners. I doubt that we could bring the confirmation time low enough to solve that problem completely, though.
@_date: 2014-02-28 04:40:49
AFAIK, new addresses are generated on demand. The reason you don't need to keep backing up is that these addresses are generated in the same order every time from the same seed.

It doesn't look like it.
Signing a transaction is actually more complicated than it's made out to be. Rather than being similar to signing a check, it's more like writing a two-part program.
The first part of the program is written by the payer and is known as scriptPubKey, but I prefer to think of it as the *challenge script*. The challenge script sets the conditions needed to redeem the payment.
The second part of the program is written by the payee and is known as scriptSig, but I prefer to think of it as the *response script*. The response script provides the data requested by the challenge script. This is usually a valid signature, but it doesn't have to be.
Loading both scripts into memory and executing gives a result. If the result is true, the coin can be redeemed. Otherwise the coin can't be redeemed.
Rather than asking for a signature, the challenge script in the first linked transaction asked for some data that when hashed twice gave a specific value. This was supplied by the second transaction.
The coin could have been redeemed by anyone who knew which data to use. No signatures were necessary.
@_date: 2014-07-14 12:39:42
You don't.
The misconception comes from the fact that Bitcoin is an electronic *cash* system. That doesn't mean Bitcoin is merely some new-fangled way to send money. It means that notions based on metal coins and paper bank notes pervade the Bitcoin protocol itself.
Many high-level explanations of Bitcoin start with a ledger, but that leads to confusion when people see what actually goes on in their wallets and on the block chain. I believe a better place to start is where Satoshi himself started - with the idea of electronic cash and a chain of ownership based on digital signatures. It's the only way his system makes any sense.
When you initiate a payment by signing a transaction, you're actually reassigning ownership to one or more coins (more technically "unspent transaction outputs" or UTXOs). In doing so, you may or may not leave spendable coins.
More importantly, you must claim change or lose it to miners as transaction fees. This leads to some conclusions that will seem very odd without first understanding the electronic cash idea:

I understood otherwise. Although only one OP_return was allowed per challenge script (and must come last), multiple outputs using OP_RETURN could be used in a single transaction.
For example, this is how Stealth Payments permit multiple payments per transaction. I seem to remember seeing some of them, but now can't locate any. Maybe you are right.

You'd basically be emailing private keys in the clear. Any compromise of your friends email account (or your own) could easily result in theft of the funds. Not to mention the numerous parties in position to read that email along the way.

I'm not sure I follow (also not too familiar with DarkWallet). There are two groups of users. One group wants to send a payment and doesn't care about Shared Coin. The other wants to make a Shared Coin transaction. The second group piggy backs onto transactions made by the first by matching the output size. Is that what you mean?


To be sure I understand, the issue is that the output sizes in a Shared Coin transaction are not uniform. Is that right?

That's the problem - brute forcing a private key means trying random private keys until you get one that encodes the target public key. Getting the address from the public key does involve SHA-256, but that's not the hard part. Getting the public key is the hard part and it has no hashing component.
There's a slight, remote chance that a shortcut to brute forcing could be developed, but it seems vey unlikely it would involve sha256 in any way.

Unlike the banking system which charges fees based on the amount of money sent, Bitcoin charges fees based on the amount of *data* sent.
A compressed public key produces a smaller transaction, which can in some cases reduce fees. There's essentially no performance penalty on the wallet side for doing this.

Yes. These laws are supposed to prevent money laundering and other criminal activities. See:


No. Both carry the same risks. Any US-based exchange will have the same regulatory responsibility. As a payment processor, Coinbase is particularly problematic from a privacy perspective.
The main problem is that Bitcoin's privacy model (transactions publicly logged but no identities revealed) is fundamentally incompatible with the traditional financial system's privacy model (trusted party logs full identity and transactions). See Section 10 (Privacy) of the white paper:


I believe bread is iOS only, so won't run on a Mac. If you have an IOS device, it seems to be one of the better wallets out there. IMO, there is no perfect wallet. They all represent varying degrees of compromise.

Those sound like they could be options as well. The transport protocol itself would be less important than the idea of enabling browsers to directly use SPV.
Mike's talk pointed out the advantage of rapid development made possible by HTML5. One downside is "being on call" in the event the necessary server component runs into trouble. I would add that this can also be offloaded to an existing web API, but the problem remains.
If the custom server requirement could be eliminated, then we could get inexpensively-produced, browser-based wallets that just used the P2P network. Trusted third party API providers (or in-house APIs) would be unnecessary.
Bitcoin Core already supports a JSON-RPC interface. One of the longstanding items on my TODO list is to try building a barebones SPV web wallet using the JSON-RPC interface. I'm not sure it's possible, but I believe seeing some discussion of pulling the built-in wallet out of Bitcoin Core and using JSON-RPC as the communication channel.
Also, Bitcore has this open issue titled "Support SPV":

I'm not familiar with Blockchain's method in detail. However, based on statements that have been made and the code I've seen, this is my mental picture of the process.
Private keys are generated within your browser. The keys are encrypted, and sent to Blockchain.info, along with the corresponding address. The encryption key is based on your account password.
Blockchain.info stores the encrypted keys on their servers. When you log in, the encrypted keys are sent to your browser, which decrypts them using the account password you entered. Using the decrypted keys, you browser signs transactions.
Blockchain maintains a source code repository. I believe the relevant file is:
which you can see contains functionality for encrypting and decrypting private keys within the browser.

Given that the private keys were generated with bitcoin qt on Tails, that eliminates many risks of network based attacks.

I'd be interested in seeing a bit more about this. For example, what risks does the COD courier take on?
The idea seems like it could solve the problem of the buyer having nothing at stake in a traditional COD arrangement. Under the proposed system, the buyer gets nothing if refusing to sign. Furthermore, the courier and merchant can divvy up the buyer's payment to cover costs, issuing the remainder to the buyer as a refund.

That could be difficult. Even though users wouldn't be voting in the sense of wielding hash power, they would be voting in the sense of which transactions to accept.
I don't think arbitrary changes to the protocol could be pushed through without some previous notification. Anything that hurt the interest of merchants or consumers could lead to migration out of Bitcoin.
Changing the block reward might be the straw that will break the camel's back for long-term holders (assuming there would be any). A true benevolent monopolist interested in maintaining its position would need to carefully consider the downsides.

It could change, but only after a lot of debate. For a taste of how painful this process would be (assuming it would ever get to this point), consider what happened recently with Dogecoin:
There's little to stop a group who wants to split off from Bitcoin from going their own way with the same software (plus change to 21 million cap), and the same block chain (up to a point).

An individual miner can decide which transactions it will add to a block and which it will reject. In principle a miner could reject any transaction that didn't have a fee equal to 1% of the transaction value. Nothing forces a miner to add a particular transaction (or any transactions) to a block.
However, another miner might accept the transaction, in which case it could end up in the block chain.
If all miners agreed to the new fee scheme, then they could make it stick.
Changing the block reward is infeasible because users would detect that invalid blocks were being generated and reject them.

There's really no other way I can think of. We all jumped in without knowing what we were doing.
You can read books and posts. You can watch videos. You can absorb any amount of the theory of money and cryptography you can tolerate, and still you won't know much about Bitcoin.
The answer is simple.
Set aside $5 and make it your mission to buy some Bitcoin with it. Use the first method that will let you get away with such a small purchase. That might be a "liquidity provider" like Coinbase, or it might be an in-person trade.
During this step, be smart about giving out financial information. If you have questions, ask here or on Depending on your method, you may discover that you need a "wallet" (which I call a "software wallet") to receive the funds. For example, if doing an in-person trade at a local Bitcoin meetup ( you'll need a software wallet to receive bitcoin. If going through Coinbase, that service gives you a software wallet of sorts.
When choosing a software wallet, pick the first one that doesn't crash when you start it. Don't become attached to this piece of software because you may well need to ditch it as you continue to learn.
Next, set yourself the goal of transferring your newly-bought bitcoin to your new software wallet. Finally, transfer the bitcoin from your software wallet to a "paper wallet", then back into your software wallet.
You should expect to irrecoverably lose your bitcoin at some point during this process, and may need to start over. That's why you only invested 5 bucks.
That's it. With $5 (or possibly $10) and a few hours of time you will have learned more than an entire class on cryptocurrency can teach.

A pay to script hash (P2SH) address is simply a script hash with some extra stuff (like a checksum) to make it human usable. The script is written in Bitcoin's transaction scripting language:
Unlike a traditional address starting with 1, a P2SH address has no private key associated with it. In this sense, the P2SH address can't be used in the same way as the tr
The traditional address starting with 1 encodes the hash of a public key, which does have a corresponding private key. The private key is what's used to sign a transaction.
This is why you can sign with the private key that goes with a traditional address, but the analogous procedure isn't defined with a P2SH address.

The creepy part is that he knew *what* you bought (food). This implies a privacy-leaking implementation on the part of the merchant.

I think the term you want to search for is "dust".  Here's a link you may find helpful
The strategy seems to be to set up a wallet containing a larger amount of bitcoin - 0.01 btc.
Then, transfer that entire amount into one of your smaller addresses- for no fee. According to the wiki, this is possible for transactions not using many bytes and over 0.01 btc:
Next, transfer, the 0.01x balance to another dust containing address. And so on.
It will be a lot of work to be sure, but it seems like it has a shot.
Edit: to be eligible for zero fees, the transaction also needs to have a high priority, which is explained under Technical Info in the link above.

To pull funds off the paper wallet, you'll need to attach a digital signature to a special message called a *transaction*. That's it - just sign a transaction. So one way to allay you concerns would be to prove to yourself that you can sign a message with a given private key.
With Electrum, you can sign a message using a private key of your choice. Here's the quickstart, but be sure to read the caveats below:
To sign a message:
    $ electrum signmessage &lt;address&gt; &lt;message&gt;
This produces a line of text representing the signatures for the message. It can be verified with:
    $ electrum verifymessage &lt;address&gt; &lt;signature&gt; message
This will produce true for a valid signature, or false otherwise.
There are other tools for producing a message signature. For example, this repo has a small utility for signing with a private key:
and here's the video that goes with it:
You'll want to do this only on an offline computer. This computer should never be connected to the internet, in the past or future. In other words, this computer should be air gapped. One way to do that is with a Linux live distribution with something like Tails.
Of course, if you have this environment set up, a more convenient way to do cold storage might be to use Electrum's offline transaction signing directly, as described in this series:

Imagine the block chain and peer-to-peer network taken together are a "bank". Although Bitcoin and modern banks are very different on a technical level, to a person with a little money to save before making a purchase, there are many similarities:
- I add money to this bank by buying bitcoin with cash (like making a deposit)
- I take money out of this bank by digitally signing a transaction (like writing a check)
- While my money is on deposit, the bank is prevented from lending it to any other customer (like a law preventing the bank from lending out deposits)
- The bank only makes money through transaction fees (as will be the case as block rewards diminish)

Private keys can be imported into MultiBit, but the process is demanding to say the least:
You're better off moving the funds with a transaction from your Electrum wallet to a newly-created MultiBit wallet.
I'm curious though, why are you switching?
@_date: 2014-10-14 17:34:22
Yes, more inputs on a transaction means more bytes, which can mean more fees:
With value constantly being split and recombined, I don't see any issues with excessive fees going forward.
However, multi input transactions present a major challenge to privacy. Wallets generally don't give the user enough control to decide for themselves how best to handle the problem. Hopefully that will change.

As far as I've been able to tell, ten minutes was chosen by Satoshi as a nice round number well beyond the interval needed to ensure complete propagation of each block and transaction throughout the network.
He was right and it worked. Orphans are a relatively rare occurrence.
I suspect the main reason confirmation time isn't revised downward is that few see the payoff being worth the risk of introducing serious, difficult-to-debug defects into the protocol.

Every transaction lists one or more "inputs" and one or more "outputs".
Think of an input as a metal coin with a fixed face value that you are spending. Your transaction uses four coins in denominations of: 15; 987.899; 15; and 18.60855 mBTC respectively.
An output is a coin being created for someone else to spend. Your transaction creates one of these valued at 1009.50655 mBTC (and the exchange has already spent it in another transaction).
This system probably seems highly counterintuitive. But it makes a lot more sense when you realize Bitcoin is an electronic cash system modeled very closely after physical cash. Here's more:
So, your wallet must have contained these four unspent coins, which you spent in your transaction, creating a new coin for the exchange to spend. Wallets typically try to hide what's going on underneath, giving you a nice surprise when you check things out on the block chain.
Given that the transaction is confirmed, your exchange should have updated your balance to reflect the payment.

As an end-user, there's nothing you can do to prevent a payment from being made to an address you control.
Miners decide whether a transaction is included in the block chain. If a mining cartel controlling a majority of the hash rate decide to do so, *they* can prevent a payment from being added to the block chain.

Every time you receive a payment, a new address is generated to hold it. Receiving change counts as receiving a payment.
No received payments means no new addresses.
Although this may seem useless, the reason to do it is privacy. For more, see:

None that I know of.


The problem with the browser history is that its essentially an unencrypted file on your computer. So any mechanism that might allow an unencrypted file to be read by an attacker could be used to read the private keys. This need not happen immediately.
For example, consider automated backup service. It's silently chugging away making copies of the file that contains your private keys. Anyone who gets into the backup gets the private key, even though it's long since been deleted from your hard drive. Browser history is an obvious file for attackers to check when gaining access to a system.
Right after creating a Blockchain.info wallet, a dialog pops up to create a paper backup, along with a warning of the risks of not backing up. I suspect that many folks have used this feature without even remembering they did so.
Maybe your setup is ok, I'm really not sure. But I've seen too many sad stories of people losing lots of money with poorly-secured wallets to be anything other than cautious.

My understanding is that there has never been a hard fork update in Bitcoin's entire history. There have been long-lived, unresolved forks, but that's different. If you know of a hard fork update, I'd be interested in having a look.

The post recognizes only two possibilities:
1. "... double spend already confirmed transactions"
2. "... prevent transactions or new blocks from other people getting accepted, effectively stopping all payments and shutting down the network. I wrote about neutralizing that attack a couple of years ago."
Gavin misses a far more profitable option for the majority cartel: the creation of a benevolent mining monopoly (BMM):
The BMM processes *all* transactions, *all the time*. The BMM does not engage in double spending its own transactions, nor does it facilitate double spending by others. The BMM is an honest miner in all respects except one:
- The BMM prevents any other mining pool from collecting block rewards.
In doing so, the BMM drives all miners to either join it or go out of business. With relatively little effort, the BMM hashrate could power up from a slight majority to nearly 100%.
This transformation could happen very quickly and could be practically irreversible. Trying to dislodge the BMM with protocol patches could destroy Bitcoin completely.
This would not be a plan executed by some irrational group of suicidal terrorists. This plan would be executed by a group who sees so much value in collecting block rewards that they decide they must own the whole enchilada.
I don't like this outcome, but I can see how it would appeal to many. So far, the only significant counterargument for why this series of events can't happen has appealed to the idea that the strategy would crash the value of Bitcoin.
If anything, the exchange rate could skyrocket. Investors love certainty almost more than anything else.
So, what am I missing, and why does the possibility seem to be consistently ignored?

AFAIK, this isn't normal behavior. That transaction had to be initiated by someone with access to your localbitcoins account.
For what it's worth, the address from which the funds were sent:
is an address used by localbitcoins for moving funds onto the block chain. It's only loosely connected to your wallet, as you can tell from all the other activity and high balances.
One last idea - you say you created a "a very secure password with only random characters". Did you write it down or otherwise store it?

Meanwhile, here are some possible scenarios - do any apply:
1. Shared MultiBit wallet between two or more computers?
2. Imported a paper wallet?
FWIW, MultiBit does not create change addresses. It sends change back to the sending address if only one address is present (default state). It sends change to another address if one is added or imported (i.e., from paper wallet).

That's a good question. From what I understand, ASIC is unlikely to be replaced by any major platform in the foreseeable future. This means optimization like we're used to in CPUs and gaming cards, not quantum leaps like mining recently experienced with ASIC.
As manufacturers are able to optimize around one architecture, Moore's law, and economies of scale are likely to kick in. This will have the effect of reducing the cost of mining hardware, reducing delivery times, and reducing the now prevalent practice of hardware pre-orders.
Eventually the market will be flooded with dirt cheap, high-performance ASIC hardware because that's just what manufacturers eventually do under capitalism.
All of this will have the effect of decentralizing hash power.

Miners claim rewards by prepending a special "coinbase" transaction to the beginning of the list of transactions. If the coin from that coinbase transaction remains unspent, you know the miner is sitting on the payment. Here's an example coinbase transaction:
You can tell this is a coinbase transaction because it has no inputs.
However, just because a coinbase transaction is spent doesn't mean that the miner cashed in. It just means that the miner moved the coinbase payment to another address.
@_date: 2014-09-29 21:10:38
Not all transactions are equally useful to all nodes.
For example, imagine I pay you a coin. Then, you pay Alice the same coin. My transaction to you is no longer needed if all you or Alice want to do is find your wallet balances.
Many queries a node might need to make have the same property that prior transactions don't matter as much. In that sense, those transactions whose outputs are unspent (the UTXO set) are more important than the rest.
This doesn't mean that all nodes can drop transactions with only spent outputs. But in some situations, that can be done.
Another example is SPV, in which a node only cares about: (1) block headers; and (2) the transactions specific to a particular wallet.

Bitcoin works by distributing a copy of every transaction to every node. Any inflation would show up as a transaction on the block chain, assuming other nodes accepted it as valid in the first place.
So, this scenario is practically impossible.
There are ways, however, to manipulate Bitcoin in more subtle ways. For example, a back door in Bitcoin's signature algorithm could allow an attacker to take funds. I'd put this one in the category of "extremely unlikely", though.
A far more practical way to mess with Bitcoin is to bribe miners, or become a miner.

No. The VP network would be able to process transactions internally just like the Bitcoin network.
However, VP transactions would be incompatible with Bitcoin transactions. A transaction sent from the VP network to the Bitcoin network would be rejected.
AFAIK, this would nullify any advantage of forking the block chain to begin with. You'd be better of just starting an altcoin with your own custom parameters.


Absolutely. Feel free to keep asking questions and I'll do my best to answer.
Edit: here's an example where things would go wrong. On the VP network, a miner would receive a block reward. If s/he tried to spend it on the Bitcoin network, the transaction would be rejected because the Bitcoin network would have no record of a mining reward having been sent to the miner's address.

One of those two amounts is change from the transaction. Here's an explanation:
The problem is that most people don't understand what Bitcoin actually is. It's an electronic cash system, as described in the whitepaper.
In a cash system, parties trade tokens marked with face value. Bitcoin replaces metal coins and paper banknotes with digital coins.
When you make a transaction, you're transferring ownership of one of your digital coins to a payee. The coin might have a face value exactly equal to your intended payment amount, or it might be higher - more likely it's higher.
You want to receive change from the transaction, otherwise you're wasting money. You can receive change by giving a change address.
Contrast this system with how credit cards work - the exact amount is transferred, no more and no less.
It turns out that adopting a cash-based frame of reference clears up all kinds of confusing points beginning and intermediate users face when learning about Bitcoin.

Radio signals have the useful property of nearly instant propagation. This stands in contrast to computer networks, which require hops between nodes and which incur delays along the way. Bitcoin's core design principle (the distributed timestamp server discussed in the whitepaper) was motivated by this problem. So faster propagation could offer new ways to improve the performance of Bitcoin.
In many places in the world, radio signals are much more readily available than internet service. Broadcast radio signals also travel further than wifi signals. So using radio could be a way to make Bitcoin usable in those places where Internet service is scarce.

Electrum usually wins out for ease of use.
However, having used both, I really like Armory's Wallet concept. It abstracts a lot of the minutia of addresses and keys, while giving you the option to pop open the hood.
Armory takes a lot longer to get up and running with because it uses Bitcoin Core and that must be fully synced. Expect at least 24 hours if not longer before you'll have a usable online Armory wallet.

Assuming this is really from Gavin...
I may be mis-interpreting, but it sounds like Gavin is proposing an actual project fork as a way to move the big blocks proposal forward.
The Bitcoin-XT project itself is a source code fork that implements a couple of features that proved controversial:
I'm not sure this plan will work. The first few to jump over to Bitcoin-Xt risk being forked off the network if others don't follow suit. It's an easy attack vector.
Set yourself up as a miner, and mine 2 MB blocks non-stop. When your block finally propagates, you know exactly which exchanges/merchants you can begin double spending against. Be sure the amount you steal covers the block reward and wait time.*
My guess is that a deeply invested organization realizing this is happening would quickly switch back to Bitcoin Core. Others would quickly follow. Experiment aborted, and mass confusion ensues.
Bottom line, this seems like the worst possible outcome and should be avoided.
*Edit: or just wait for the first 2 MB block to propagate. Nothing invested other than time.

What happens when the block subsidy disappears is one of the most frequently asked questions in Bitcoin.
The answer tends to be something along the lines of "transaction fees take over." But it's possible that transaction fees won't ever be be a major part of the Bitcoin ecosystem.
There are some interesting thoughts on the topic in this essay which points out that a well-connected node operator can make money in several ways that don't directly relate to collecting transaction fees:
Bitcoin tends to be viewed for what it is today: a niche financial system that processes a tiny fraction of the world's transactions. It's difficult to imagine Bitcoin as the settlement system for a big chunk of the world's transactions. 
The changes needed to get to that point could invalidate just about any discussion we could have today about the economics of generating blocks and securing the network.
That said, even a bad model for the future is better than no model. Looking forward to the next essay from Gavin.

The total circulation of bitcoin has been [pre-determined to be 21 million units]( which will be approached gradually into the year 2140. Until 2020 or so, the supply of bitcoin will increase at a rate much greater than 5% per year.
In this sense, the supply of bitcoin is expanding very quickly and will do so for some time.
One definition of deflation is a contraction of money supply. Make your own choice whether this applies to bitcoin. Most would agree that assuming the cap holds, bitcoin will not be an inflationary system within a few decades, but is one currently.
However, the *apparent* total supply of bitcoins is in principle expandable through [fractional reserve banking]( although this point is hotly debated.

SSSS is a general-purpose method for splitting a secret into cryptographic shares. It can split any message.

The wiki states:


This is misleading at best. SSSS has nothing to do with Bitcoin's Script system, but is rather a way to cryptographically split a message into shares, and the reassemble those shares. The idea appears similar to multisig, but has little underlying connection.
Raw multisig scripts are still supported, but they have nothing to do with SSSS.

Right now, fees are mainly an anti-spam measure. Giving transactions a cost ensures that spammers and other attackers can't flood the network with transactions.
When you publish your transaction, you give it to a node. That node then relays the transaction to its peers, those peers relay it to their peers, and so on.
With an insufficient relay fee, few nodes will relay the transaction. That means few miners will receive it, and confirmation will take a long time or won't take place at all.

Merchants at restaurants and the like generally accept unconfirmed transactions. Their merchant processor will likely check for an invalid zero-fee payment and reject it, but I'm not sure exactly how that's handled among different payment gateways.


Potentially, yes. If the merchant waits for one confirmation and never gets it, then you're checkout won't complete until you pay with sufficient fee.

Yes. Qt talks directly to the peer to peer network and uses the protocol itself to verify transactions. You don't need to rely on any third parties.
Blockchain.info wallets don't work without Blockchain.info, and all transactions are mediated through that third party. This has implications for both privacy and security.
For example, if blockchain.info were hacked and started delivering malicious javascript, your funds could be put at risk. I'm not saying this will happen, but it's the nature of a web application.

Not exactly.
Bitcoin addresses are mathematically derived from private keys. A private key is just a number between 1 and ~10^77. See:
The sequence for creating an address is:
private key -&gt; public key -&gt; address.
The reverse process is considered impossible for practical purposes. Ditto with iterating over all possible private keys.
Coinbase hides your private key from you. Because of this, there is no way to protect yourself against a Mt. Gox-style disaster with funds held on Coinbase. This is one reason for the advice to avoid holding BTC funds on Coinbase. Cold storage should be used instead:

Majority hash rate from a single organization is far worse than majority hash rate from a mining pool.
The reason is that pools can form and disband very quickly. Should a pool operator decide to "go rogue" and begin exercising its powers, it could see its majority disappear quickly as miners directed their rigs to mine in other pools.
A single-organization majority miner can do all of that without the risk of losing its majority status. Because of its solid foundation, a majority miner can do one other thing - install itself as a monopoly by depriving other miners of block rewards:

Short term loans you mean? It turns out there is [Bitbond]( I have no experience with them, but there are a lot similar services popping up. Short-term bitcoin loans might be something to consider, but they are not without risk. 
Do any of your suppliers accept bitcoin yet? You might look around (and ask). If you find some, then one strategy might be to take out short-term bitcoin loans to pay for goods/services from these suppliers. This would eliminate the need to ever convert to fiat, possibly saving money. Depending on your margins, this could be substantial.

Interesting take. It seems like the calculation is something like:
cost/transaction = (reward + fees per day) / (# transactions per day)
Maybe this number reflects the fact that Bitcoin is underutilized as a payment system at the moment. The only variable in the short term is the denominator.
It doesn't seem that the # of transactions has much to do with mining economics, other than to add slightly to the computational burden.* The most important dynamic in mining revolves around ferocious competition that reduces the top line for any ASIC hardware by 50% every month, from what I can tell.
More transactions wouldn't do much to change that dynamic.
Edit: clarity
Edit: * obviously, to a point. Increasing the # of transactions to a high enough level will begin to factor into the cost of processing transactions. I'm not sure where that level is.

Define "safe".
There are two things I'd think about:
1. Security. Can someone steal your funds just with an address? *No*.
2. Privacy. Can someone learn something of value about you and your business dealings? Most certainly *yes*.
Privacy is something you should carefully consider. If an attacker knows your address, s/he can see the addresses paying you and those you pay. Because sh/e knows your identity, s/he might be able to use the block chain to find the identities of those you deal with. An attacker might be able to use that information against you by lying to you, or pretending s/he's one of those people, for example. But that's just the tip of the iceberg.
Loss of privacy can easily lead to loss of security. There's a reason that safety deposit boxes are opened in a private viewing area.
For example, if an attacker sees you're dealing with a lot of Bitcoin, s/he might decide to target you for physical theft.
An so on.

The network consists of nodes - and only nodes. You can think of a node as a program running on a computer, although there are more complex configurations.
A node connects to somewhere between about 8 and 100 other nodes, which are called peers.
Nodes spread a transaction through the network through a process similar to the game "Telephone." You give your transaction to a single node. That node sends it to its peers, and so on. The process is called *propagation*.
Your payment for coffee works the same way. You send the signed transaction to a node, who relays it to peers. Those peers relay it, and so on.
The store owner listens to a different node than yours. However, propagation ensures that this node will fairly quickly receive the transaction after you send it to your node.

It also turns out that being able to send 0.001 BTC just as easily as 1000 BTC is also one of Bitcoin's biggest strengths.
So maybe the ultimate storage solution wouldn't be a one size fits all approach, but a spectrum of products that can relax security restrictions depending on how much is at stake.
For example, I see no problem with a relatively low security approach such as unencrypted private keys stored on paper or software wallets for short term storage of the cost of a night out.
For long term storage, I'll seek out a more secure solution. It would need to have some form of redundancy in case the primary access became disabled.

I'm not sure about that. I'm thinking not so much of an attack that would double spend the cartel's own transactions and reorder existing transactions. Rather, I'm thinking of a cartel interested in monopolizing the power to create blocks (and collect fees/rewards).


From what I understand, the probability of success is not just good, but 100% given &gt;50% of hash power.


I recall that quote from Gavin's proposal linked by the OP. However, I think he/you, and I are talking about different things.
I'm considering a cartel that wants to play by the book. No double spends. All valid transactions included in blocks. The objective is to gain 100% of block rewards but nothing more. A benevolent dictator of sorts.
Although I could be misreading it, Gavin's proposal seems aimed at a cartel intent on blocking transaction processing. In that case, the proposed defense makes sense.


But how would his proposed defense counter the threat posed by an honest majority cartel intent on capturing 100% of block rewards and transaction fees?


Maybe this is what I'm missing. It seems trivial to listen for blocks being broadcasted, and simply model your own privately mined blocks on those existing blocks. Take every transaction in each block announced publicly and add them to your own private block. Why wouldn't that work?

The good news is that this version actually defines the term "virtual currency business".
The bad news is that "other value" part brings even businesses processing their own payments under the "virtual currency businesses" umbrella.
In other words, every business that accepts Bitcoin by running a node (rather than using a payment processor) becomes a virtual currency business, subject to licensing requirements.
Edit: depending on how you read it, even merchant using a Bitcoin payment processor can be considered "virtual currency businesses."

Scrypt is harder to bruteforce than SHA-256, but it can still be done given a determined attacker and a weak password. Alternatively, anyone who should learn you password can unlock the private key and the funds.
Should you lose the BIP0038 private key, then it's game over. Using a BIP0038 private key requires you to have something and know something. The extra security can be helpful, but it can also work against you.

A paper wallet is just a piece of paper with a number written on it. The number falls within a large range (1 - ~10^77) and can be written in several ways. This number is a private key.
So far, no saving anything in a system, right?
An address is made from  private key using math. No saving or system needed there, either.
When you make a payment,  you use your private key to digitally sign a specially formatted message called a transaction. Signing works without anything being saved as well.
So, short answer is that the math works the same way on all computers.

There are no silver bullets in security. You can shoot yourself in the foot with any solution. For example:
The problem with setting a password on a primary backup is that you can lock yourself out just as easily as a thief. A password on a cold storage wallet will not be used often. Infrequently-used information is easily forgotten.
Here's a counterpoint that argues that an unencrypted backup, securely stored, should be the foundation of any savings plan:

- Shamir's secret sharing
- Multisig wallets
- Married wallets

It's possible, but unlikely, for two different private keys to generate the same address through a "hash collision".
Making an address is a 3-step process:
private key -&gt; public key -&gt; address
Should two different private keys happen to generate the same address, then both private key owners would jointly control any funds sent to the respective addresses.
You can get a glimpse at how this works by generating a "compressed" and "uncompressed" address for the same private key (for example, using brainwallet.org). The addresses will be unique, but controlled by the same private key.

It [took me some reading and false starts]( to figure out that Bitcoin *doesn't* solve the Two Generals Problem - it solves the [Byzantine Generals Problem]( which is a related, but separate problem. Here's my current understanding, which may still need some work.
The problem crops up whenever independent, mistrustful parties must work together to achieve some collective action.
The problem was originally framed in terms of a group of generals camped around an enemy city. The generals need to come up with a plan (retreat, attack, if attack - when?), but can't ever meet in person. The only means of communication is by messenger sent by foot from one camp to another. Further complicating matters, not every general can be trusted to be loyal to the cause.
The problem to be solved is:
- All loyal generals need to decide upon the same plan of action.
- A small number of traitors cannot cause the loyal generals to adopt a bad 
How do the generals agree on a plan of action?
A naive (and incorrect) solution would be to allow any general to send a proposal at any time to the other generals. One reason this fails is that by the time a proposal reaches a receiving general, he may have already sent his own plan to another general. There may be dozens of messages moving between generals at any one time - each with a different plan. Worse, there's no good way to distinguish messages from traitors and loyal generals.
This problem translates to Bitcoin if we imagine the generals as miners, the goal of the operation to be the construction of a valid block chain, and the means of communication to be blocks sent over a peer-to-peer network.
Satoshi's solution, as described in the [white paper]( and in [an email]( is to force miners to wait an adjustable amount of time before broadcasting a new block, to make it easy for honest miners to detect fraud, and to ensure that only one valid block sequence would ever recognized by honest miners as a group.
Robust systems for reaching consensus are not easy to create. The banking system and representative democracy are two examples that have shown varying degrees of success.
People like Andreas Antonopoulos and others are excited about Satoshi's solution to the Byzantine Generals problem because of its potential to be applied to many kinds of problems relating to finding and maintaining consensus.
Bitcoin as a payment system, as mind-blowing as it is, may be just the beginning.

One thing to be aware of is that anyone you give your address to will know how much money is in your paper wallet. Depending on exactly what you're doing to earn the money, this could put you in a risky position. For example, you might become the subject of an extortionist. A stalker might take an interest in when you get paid, how much, and when you make withdrawals. You get the picture.
I'd recommend creating a one time address for every payment you receive. That way, the payee sees only an empty address, and can only follow payments you make after the fact. Even that reveals a some of information, but it's better than reusing the same address to collect multiple payments.
A good wallet should make it easy to create one time payment addresses.

The block chain (together with the network) is what protects Bitcoin users from double spending. More about the double spending problem here:
Bitcoin has had a love/hate relationship with centralized services that keep the movement of funds "off-chain". If you use an exchange or "liquidity provider" like Coinbase, then you've used off-chain transactions. ChangeTip is another example of an off-chain service. When bitcoin enters or leaves these systems, a transaction is logged on the block chain. But when bitcoin is inside these systems, nothing happens on the block chain.
Centralization of a ledger is fast and convenient, but it is also much less secure than using the block chain, as those who lost funds through Mt. Gox and other schemes can attest.

To create a multisig address, you combine two pieces of information:

- the number of required signatures
The product of that combination is a "redemption script". Processing this script gives a multisignature address. Here's an online tool you can play with to see how it works:
Although you could use the public key for an existing address, doing so doesn't buy you much. The multisignature address and standard address wouldn't communicate with each other.

The one that comes closest is Bither:
However, I don't think it would work for exchanging off-blockchain transactions from one person to another. Bither's support of transaction QR codes is aimed at cold storage, and doesn't update the wallet until the transaction is posted to the network (AFAIK).
The key is that Bither wold have to support the underlying accounting to make sure you don't double spend your partner's payment. Even then it would be tricky because you might want to revoke an off-chain transaction you had made (wrong payee address, for example). So simply giving a transaction to a payee offline is just the start.

There is no "assumption" about anything. Bitcoin is an ongoing experiment about the nature of money. And it appears to be proving the puffed-up intellectual lightweight Prof. Bitcorn wrong on several counts - not just the asinine price prediction.

If by "best" you mean most profitable, that's a tough question. 
Bitcoin excels at eliminating middlemen. Yet various companies have set themselves up as Bitcoin middlemen (exchanges and hosted wallet providers, for example). It may only a matter of time before their core business models come under fire from competition that never sleeps, sloughs off any attempt at regulation, and works for free.
When working as designed, Bitcoin replaces highly-trained middlemen and expensive infrastructure investments with distributed networks, open protocols, and open source software. In other words, services that previously required a team of trained experts become a commodity provided for free or at low cost. Imagine the Open Bazaar model being adapted to bitcoin&lt;-&gt;fiat interconversion, for example.
While it may convince investors for a short time, a trusted gatekeeper model has too much stacked against it to work out long term. Find ways to embrace this effect as a startup.
As I said, it's a tough question.

The idea seems to be that a $1 million land title might motivate an attacker to spend $1 million to double spend through a block chain reorganization attack.

Here's a thread that looks similar to your situation:
To summarize: MultiBit lets you put your wallet files into any folder on your system. The poster in the thread I linked found his wallet files by searching his drive for a .wallet file - and found it. Looks like you're on Windows, so a global search for a file matching *.wallet might point to where they are.
Try not to panic. MultiBit wallets don't just disappear (usually). If you "close" a wallet (File &gt; Close Wallet), it will no longer be available from the GUI, which is a very annoying "feature" that puts the burden on you to remember where the blazes you saved your wallet to. But the wallet is still there - you just need to track it down.
Other things to consider:
- When was the last time you remember using MultiBit and what what did you do?
- How many MultiBit wallets did you create?
- What's your overall level of experience with Bitcoin and Wallet software?
- Did you make any backups of your wallet?
- Is your computer connected to an automatic backup service?
- worst case: wallets have been wiped from you system, but still might be recovered if the system is left undisturbed. Contact a trustworthy professional data recovery service. In the meantime use another computer.

Thanks, that makes sense.
As I understand it, this an attack on a service using off-chain accounting such as a mixer, exchange, tipbot, etc.
Cast of characters:
- Attacker: bad guy
- Service: a service running off-chain accounting system
- Pool: a mining pool
Attacker attempts to learn the nodes that Service is connected to by analyzing transaction propagation during withdrawals. Using this information, attacker creates a direct connection to Service.
Next, Attacker creates direct connections to several Pools.
Attacker creates a transaction (TxA) making a valid, 100 BTC deposit to Service. TxA is not broadcast, but added to a block being solo mined.
TxA: Attacker-&gt;Service
Eventually Attacker succeeds in mining a valid block. The block is not broadcast immediately. Instead, Attacker waits for the next block to be mined by one of the Pools being watched. On receiving this block, Attacker immediately sends his own block to Service.
Service sees Attacker's block before the one from Pool. In so doing, TxA is confirmed from the perspective of Service. Pool's block eventually reaches Service as well, creating a fork. Service still considers Attacker's block as correct because it was received first.
At this point, Service thinks that Attacker has made a deposit using TxA, and that this transaction has one confirmation. However, the block chain has been forked. Service (and possibly other nodes as well) thinks the Attacker's block is valid but other nodes think the Pool's block is valid.
Attacker immediately makes a 100 BTC withdrawal from Service to an address controlled by him. Service obliges by creating and broadcasting transaction TxB.
TxB: Service-&gt;Attacker
At the same time, Attacker creates and broadcasts a new transaction, TxC. This transaction double spends the 100 BTC used in TxA.
If Attacker's block ends up winning by being built on next, then this is the block chain:
...-[TxA]-[TxB] (TxC is dropped as a double spend of TxA)
In other words, Attacker has made a deposit and a withdrawal to Service. No loss, no gain. Try again.
If Pool's block wins, then this is the block chain:
...-[   ]-[TxB,TxC] (TxA is dropped as a double spend of TxC)
In other words, Attacker has received 100 BTC from TxB and transferred 100 BTC between two addresses he owns with TxC.
This attack seems limited to Services that allow Attacker to:
- discover and directly connect to Service's Bitcoin node
- deposit and withdraw funds
Are there any other applications of the attack?

It's from this post:


The quote you reference is a response to this comment:


Satoshi didn't seem to consider the case of the buyer simply forgetting to pay the seller after the goods were received [or losing the private key]. Once the buyer receives the goods, there is little motivation to complete that part of the transaction.
Using an escrow agent with multisig 2 of 3 can eliminate this problem because the seller can appeal to the escrow agent to release funds.
So unless this is the basic scenario you were considering, I'd say the OP quote was taken somewhat out of context.

Thanks, that's helpful. Here's an example to check my understanding:
Chuck, a member of a 51% cabal buys gold bars from Alice for 100 BTC. Alice waits for 6 confirmations and gives the gold to Chuck. There's no fraud involved.
The next day, Chuck goes to Bob's place intending to buy more gold bars for 100 BTC. But this time, Chuck's transaction references the same output as his transaction to Alice.
Normally this second transaction would be rejected as a double spend attempt. But the cabal can mine a valid block containing the invalid transaction because they own a majority of hashing power.
After 6 confirmations, Bob gives Chuck the gold. This is a double spend.
Could Bob reliably detect the double spend at this point?
Eventually the cabal loses its majority hashrate. The Block Chain contains a double spend. How would it be resolved (if at all)? Who ends up with the 100 BTC?

Spot on. Adoption by brick and mortar businesses is a novelty right now and for the foreseeable future. For all the griping about credit card fees, the cost of adoption is too high and the number of customers who pay with Bitcoin is too low.
Every time I've paid at a brick and mortar business in the last year, the process has been awkward. The system is down. There's no internet. The clerk forgot how to take a payment, even though I paid said clerk two months before without a problem.
The only thing I'd add is the possibility that Bitcoin never catches on as a medium for in person payments at stores. It could be that Bitcoin's true value lies elsewhere entirely. We've got a financial network that can do things no other can.

It's possible, especially given enough time.
Unfortunately, the financial incentives are on the side of surveillance. Law enforcement organizations will pay a lot of money to be able to identify users. There's not an obvious source of big funding for privacy research.
Without privacy, there is no chance of fungibility, so the two issues are linked - at least in my mind.
To be clear, privacy is the ability of an organization or individual to selectively reveal information about itself. If I'm compelled to give away information about myself or do it unwittingly, then my privacy is degraded.
Most people care deeply about financial privacy and expect to have it by default, as evidenced by the long tradition of banking secrecy and outrage when those policies fail.
Almost nobody cares about anonymity or expects to have it. I say this because it's very important to properly frame the debate.

Some misinformation here:
1. You don't "log in" to Bitcoin.
2. Users are identified by pseudonyms on the block chain.
The job of any criminal forensics effort is to link a Bitcoin pseudonym of interest to a real-world identity.
The most obvious way to link your Bitcoin pseudonyms with your identity is to transact on an AML/KYC exchange. Or to deal with someone who does.
There are probably dozens of less obvious ways to destroy your financial privacy using Bitcoin.
It's important to realize that financial privacy isn't about being able to get away with drug deals. It's about staying free from harassment by bullies of all stripes, including your own government. A blackmailer or confidence man can use exactly the same techniques used by the Danish government to extract some action from you.

Then I'm puzzled how you "remember it's private key". A private key, even expressed in WIF format is many random digits.
How do you know that you know the private key? Is it actually written down somewhere, or is your memory exceptionally good?
Note that Bitcoin QT creates multiple private keys as you spend funds. You don't have just one when using that wallet.
@_date: 2014-08-10 15:09:40


It creates an address based on a 33-byte public key instead of a 65-byte public key.
An elliptic curve is symmetrical about a horizontal line:
The public key is simply a point on this curve. When signing a transaction, you need to provide your public key for signature verification. So we can save storage space (and possibly transaction fees) by using *compressed public keys*.
A compressed public key represents the public key point as one coordinate (32 bytes) plus one parity byte that indicates whether the point lies above or below the symmetry axis. Uncompressed keys use this parity byte anyway and require 65 bytes: 1 byte + 32 bytes + 32 bytes = 65 bytes. Compressed keys use 1 byte + 32 bytes = 33 bytes. So we can save 32 bytes on each signature by using compressed public keys:
You don't see a difference in address length because an address results in part from the sequential application of sha256 and ripemd160 hashes to the public key, both of which functions produce fixed-width output. Base58 encoding + checksum follows to create the address:
The take-home message is that each public key can generate *two* addresses. One represents the compressed public key and the other represents the uncompressed public key. They can only be distinguished when signing a transaction. The address representing the compressed public key will produce a shorter signature, which can result in lower fees the user redeeming a previously-received payment:

Change can in principle be returned to the sending address. For example, Change addresses can be disabled in Electrum:
If you configured Electrum to not use change addresses, and you removed all change addresses and receiving addresses, you would end up with a hot wallet that had only the bit-card address and which returned all change back to the card.
MultiBit is an example of a wallet that eliminates changes addresses by default. If your single MultiBit address were also you bit-card address, you could keep making transactions through MultiBit without changing the card.

Bitcoin's privacy model is based on the idea of *pseudonymity*. This means that transactions are fully public, but identities are not.


Yes, in the sense that the chains of ownership for three different coins have been linked together.
If your identity becomes linked to any one of the three addresses, it could also be linked to the other two by deduction.
The terms you'll want to search are "multi-input transaction" and "multiple input transaction", together with "privacy" (not "anonymity").
That said, this is a significant privacy issue in Bitcoin
Here's a bit more about the problem:


That inputs are signed *independently* of one another. In other words, you and I can separately sign the inputs of a transaction, but nobody knows we're both participating. It looks like a single person (if you don't understand how transactions work).
This principle has led to CoinJoin:
Which has been followed with a trustless way to do CoinJoin, CoinShuffle:
The emergence of these mixing schemes makes it increasingly problematic to assume that all inputs in a multi-input transaction belong to the same users, as Sarah Meiklejohn notes in the linked video above.

The problem you need to solve is how to sign a transaction offline using that private key:
The main concern is if the private key is exposed to a network connected device, it could be lost to an attacker now or later. By keeping the private key offline, you eliminate that risk.
There's a secondary risk as well, which can't be eliminated with offline signing. Your public key never enters the block chain until you sign a transaction with the corresponding private key. Given your public key there are theoretical attacks that could take place at some point in the future:
The options for signing a transaction offline from a paper wallet private key are not that good. One of them is to manually generate the transaction yourself, then post to blockchain.info or similar with the push tx API:

@_date: 2014-08-11 14:40:29
A simple, but illustrative example is a multisig Bitcoin wallet. You can set one up yourself with:
Two people can set up a multisig wallet such that either one or the other must sign before funds will be released. Nobody gives you permission to do this, and no individual polices it. This kind of joint account is controlled by math and the Bitcoin network.
To get the same functionality from the banking system, you must get permission from a bank. Then the bank must police the system. If you run afoul of the bank's polices (or those of some other organization), you may be banned from the banking system altogether.
Bitcoin is permissionless finance. As specialized wallets like copay become more widely available, the ability to set up contracts with Bitcoin will become more accessible to nontechnical users.
A joint account through Copay is just a simple example to illustrate the point. It turns out that Bitcoin transactions can be linked together, held off the block chain, and variously manipulated to produce cryptographically secured financial instruments that resemble things like wills and contracts.
Here are some examples:
To understand this on a technical level, you need to understand Script and how transactions actually work:

Some thoughts:
1. White/Blacklisting becomes much more enforceable when mining is centralized in one jurisdiction.
2. Users who make it easy to link their Bitcoin pseudonyms with external pseudonyms (bank accounts, IP addresses, cookies, legal names) degrade their own privacy and potentially that of other users.
3. Centralized liquidity providers and payment processors can do a lot of damage to privacy and fungibility.
4. Bitcoin needs better, easier-to-use privacy tools.
5. Given a strong disposable key pair policy and good operational security, most of the scenarios above will be difficult to even identify, if not enforce.
I believe we're still very much at the stage of just getting basic payments working well. Some like you have seen the potential to implement financial surveillance on a massive scale and exploit that power. But most others in Bitcoin (and especially the media) are only slightly aware of what lies ahead with respect to financial privacy on the block chain.

Although I think we're many years at best from something like this happening, it's an idea worth thinking about.
The recent extremely well done discussion led by dblcross121 on [Bitcoin and US taxes]( makes it very clear that taxation is going to be a hot-button issue (maybe *the* hot-button issue) as Bitcoin gains popularity.
Should users be forced to treat bitcoin as a capital asset for tax purposes, this will create a nightmare for anyone attempting to use bitcoin to buy daily necessities. But this is exactly what would happen should bitcoin start to become accepted at one or more major supermarkets, for example.
The temptation for otherwise law-abiding citizens to blow off the whole capital taxation thing could be extreme. We might start to see something along the lines of what was seen during Prohibition, when the law was routinely ignored. Should this happen, the federal government would be much more receptive to alternative tax systems than it is now.
It wouldn't surprise me if the flat-taxers and the consumption-taxers got together and actually started to make headway in such an environment.
I'm not going to hold my breath for any of this to come to pass, though. Bitcoin is still a fringe idea. On the other hand, it's on an exponential growth curve, which makes predicting the future very hard.

This can be accomplished by signing, but not broadcasting, a transaction paying the receiver's address. In fact, this process of giving another person a transaction that isn't immediately broadcast plays a role in something called "contracts":
Regardless of exactly how the off-chain payment is made, the problem is that the sender can double-spend the underlying coins. However, there are many situations in which this is not a concern. For example:
- low-value transactions
- short period of time off-chain
- you trust the payer not to double spend

I actually agree - Bitcoin is one hack away from being worthless, or pretty close to it. However, I think the number of bugs that could cause this are few relative to the other kinds of bugs that just cause inconvenience.
CVE-2010-5141 was a doozy. It allowed any user to spend any other users' coins.
The book tells the story in a way I hadn't seen before:










Even today, getting basic information on this bug is not easy:
If a bug like this were found today, things would be quite different. The secret would be all but impossible to conceal. Getting enough nodes updated with the patch could take much longer than the time needed to spend every UTXO worth a substantial sum. There would be no update slipped in with a bunch of others. There would be a sudden, crushing collapse.
Any kind of "reset" of the block chain would be the end of Bitcoin - period. Money and confidence are inextricably linked.
It may seem like the endless debate about the block size limit accomplishes nothing. However, those who understand the potential damage of an update gone wrong know why this level of careful review is necessary. This is especially true of any hard-fork update, and especially given that none have been tried before.
It's far better for a bad idea to be killed before it makes it into a Bitcoin Core update. Some mistakes are irreversible.

There is another option that until recently didn't seem to get much attention:
Retarget the maximum block size in a similar manner to the way difficulty is retargeted. This idea makes it possible to solve two of the most contentious issues:
- block capacity grows - or shrinks - as needed
- using a slightly sub-optimal value for block size can introduce scarcity, stimulating a fee market
The more I think about this idea, the more sense it makes. We need to take this discussion out of meat space and let the network handle it. Retargeting block size does that, and more.

~10 minute confirmation times are normal and part of the design of the Bitcoin network.
Before being confirmed, transactions are in an unconfirmed state. They're visible to the network, but have not been added to a block in the block chain yet.
Payments made between Coinbase wallets don't use the block chain, and so can confirm almost instantly. When moving funds outside of Coinbase, the block chain is used and so the 10 minute confirmation time applies.

Similar species.
The problems with Coinbase and other liquidity providers run deeper still. They are all subject to invasive know-your-customer laws that make it their business to be in your business, and turn over what they find to authorities. This may not seem like a problem because you have "nothing to hide", but consider for a minute the power this gives these organizations.
Combined with the public nature of the block chain, and the fact that Coinbase processes merchant payments as well, we have a closed regulatory circuit, with the Bitcoin user in the middle.

It's not "1 Bitcoin", it's an electronic token with a face value that can can happen to be "1 bitcoin" or "0.003123 bitcoin", or lots of other values. In terms of today's language we'd call a coin an "unspent transaction output" or UTXO.
This is one of the hardest concepts to understand in Bitcoin, by the way. Ironically, the connection to physical cash (metal coins and paper banknotes) is one of the few real-world analogies in Bitcoin that actually translates all the way down to source code.
The "chain of digital signatures" part is still alive and well. You can see it in action today when you use block explorers like blockchain.info to find out the address of your payer, the address of their payer, and so on all the way to a miner subsidy. That's a chain of digital signatures. The whitepaper also refers to it as a "chain of ownership" at the start of Section 2.
People had figured this all out before Satoshi began his work. The part Satoshi added was a method to prevent double spending (a user paying two users with the same electronic coin) without using a centralized "mint".
Once you understand what Satoshi is talking about by an "electronic coin", a lot of mysterious ideas (Colored Coins, Counterparty, Change Addresses, Stealth Addresses, mixers, CoinJoin, Script, the block chain, double spending, and many more) will start to make more sense. Here's more on the topic:

The part that almost every beginner (and even more advanced users) misses is that Bitcoin is an "electronic cash system".
This doesn't mean that Bitcoin is some new-fangled cyberspace technology.
It quite literally means that Bitcoin works like an electronic form of cash (the metal coins and paper banknotes in your pockets). You'll have to unlearn a lot of what you know about credit card payments, unfortunately, because those concepts will only get in the way of understanding Bitcoin.
When your wallet makes a payment, you're actually telling it to send a secure message to the Bitcoin network. This message transfers your ownership of one or more digital "coins" to another user.
Here's a high-level overview:

Theres this idea out there that users shouldn't have to worry about the protocol and that software should take care of the details.
I agree with that as an ideal. But Bitcoin is very far away from that level of sophistication. Worse, this is money were talking about, not learning how to program or assemble a computer.
Until the tools that automatically handle privacy and security have been created, I believe every user needs to become mp aware of not just how Bitcoin works, but how that affects their security and privacy.
There have just been too many cases of people lunging forward without the complete picture and getting nailed for it later.
Your approach of starting small and continuing to learn is a good way around that.

A 1,000 satoshi transaction falls below the 5460 satoshi dust limit and so will be rejected by miners running the default implementation:
Even with a fee of 0.1 mBTC, the transaction will be rejected by these miners. That said, some miners relax the dust limit and will add the transaction to a block.
Any transaction with a dust output will be rejected in full. In other words, the rejection of a dust output invalidates all other outputs in the transaction.

First heard about Bitcoin in early 2011 from Hacker News. Started looking into it seriously in June 2011 after reading about websites that made visitors' computers mine for bitcoin. Bitcoin idea blew my mind when I finally began to understand it. It seemed too good to be true.
Bought some coins with Western Union from a total stranger across the country. Felt like a fool doing it. There was virtually nothing you could do with the stuff except gamble it or trade it back for cash.
Watched as my initial small investment lost 90% of its value over a grueling decline that lasted months. Never sold. Just kept trying to learn everything I could.
During that decline, internet interest in Bitcoin seemed to dry up and die. Almost nobody talked about it, nobody wrote about it. Nobody seemed to care.
I've seen the same pattern happen a few times since then. I find the honey badger mascot quite fitting. Bitcoin has "died" so many times that it seems the darned thing is practically indestructible.

A majority cartel can do these three things as long as it has &gt;50% of the network hashrate:
- Reverse transactions that he sends while he's in control. This has the potential to double-spend transactions that previously had already been seen in the block chain.
- Prevent some or all transactions from gaining any confirmations
- Prevent some or all other miners from mining any valid blocks
Whether a group with majority hashrate decides to use these powers or not is a different story. If they did, then you'd expect to see:
- reports that transactions with multiple confirmations have been double spent. Note that the attacker can't create invalid transactions.
- reports that transactions with sufficient fees are taking a long time to be confirmed
- reports that some or all other miners are not getting block rewards
There's a more subtle form of attack in which a majority cartel delays publishing blocks and then suddenly releases several (dozens, or maybe hundreds) blocks all at once. In that case, the symptoms might not be noticeable until after the attack was complete.

I give you a pizza cut into eight pieces. I then cut each piece into ten pieces, yielding 80 pieces of pizza.
Did you have more pizza before or after I made the cuts?
Still, your point is valid in that many people can't think quantitatively like this. You see evidence for it in folks who have bought a stock that splits. They think they've gained something when all that's happened is that each piece of pizza has been cut in two. The value of the pizza (company) didn't change, nor did their ownership (percentage) of it.
Still, news of stock split often leads to increased buying. And people still complain about not being able to afford "a whole bitcoin."

You need to spend all bitcoin at the address. This is where the analogy to paper bills breaks down: you can't combine two $20 bills to make a $40 bill. But in effect, this is what happens when you send two Bitcoin payments to the same address.

Maybe, but one problem to watch out for is leaky abstractions.
We see this with wallet software. For example, many wallets hide the fact that bitcoin is actually an electronic cash system that uses crypographic signatures and a bunch of other technology to reassign ownership of digital tokens called "coins".
This seems like a good idea at first, but users can (and do) hit corner cases with surprising regularity. Case in point - change addresses:
Using Circle might seem like using any other online banking service, except it's not. There's no FDIC, the underlying technology is vastly different, and the regulation is in flux.
Consumers may not make the distinction, which could lead to big trouble and a reputation hit to Bitcoin itself down the road.

Thanks for the info. I'm still a bit fuzzy on how this might apply to Bitcoin. Transmission seems to depend on both the acceptance and transmission of funds, but Bitcoin makes it possible for an intermediary to never hold funds in the first place.
For example, a merchant payment processor might simply ensure that customer funds get deposited into a merchant HD wallet, without actually taking delivery of the funds. If the processor were to accept funds into its own wallet, that would be one thing, but this scenario is different because the processor never holds the merchant's funds.
It seems a bit like a (hypothetical) traditional payment processor simply displaying to a customer a merchant's bank account number, then telling the customer to make the deposit, then notifying the merchant when the deposit has cleared.

It's a fast payment network that can be layered on top of the Bitcoin network. Transactions are practically instant, and can be sent in a quantity limited only by network bandwidth. One soft fork change would be needed to support it.
The Lightning Network uses one of Bitcoin's best kept secrets - payment channels. A payment channel is a type of contract set up between a client and a server. The server offers services to the client, who pays for them with bitcoin. Any situation in which a good or service can be spread out over time is a good candidate for payment channels. This turns out to be a lot of situations, such as currency trading, pay-per-view video, monthly metered content subscriptions, and utilities to name a few.
One surprising thing about payment channels is that despite thousands of transactions that can take place between client and server, only two transactions are ever published: the one opening the channel and the one closing it.
The "network" part of the Lightning Network is exciting because opening and closing the channel becomes the expensive part of the process. The Lightning Network allows you to re-use a channel open with one server so that it can be used with potentially many other servers.
Many have expressed worry that Bitcoin doesn't scale. Confirmations take too long. The block chain keeps growing. And so on. The main effect of the Lightning Network (and other services based on payment channels) is to prove that Bitcoin *does* scale, but maybe not it the way you imagined.

This will leak privacy. Simply spending old coins until the target amount is collected will create a multi-input transaction sooner or later.
A multi-input transaction allows multiple chains of coin ownership to be linked together on the block chain. In one step, this default *undoes* everything the HD wallet was trying to do in the first place with a disposable key pair policy.
Leaking privacy in this way allows an attacker to determine a higher minimum wallet balance than would otherwise be possible. This can be used in various attacks, including, blackmail and extortion.
Yes, CoinJoin is used from time to time. Nevertheless, multi-input transactions can still be used as part of an investigation trying to link a personal identity to addresses.
Either this proposal should leave out recommendations on coin selection altogether, or an alternative should be developed that better protects user privacy.
I still think wallets can (and should) do more to implement coin control in a user-friendly way.

This looks like it's geared toward solving the multifactor problem for Bitcoin wallets.
It's actually a very interesting idea. You can generate a private key in such a way that it's split into two pieces.
This lets you have a wallet controlled by two factors. One factor could be a program running on your smart phone. Although, I suspect this factor could also be an automated cloud service like greenaddress provides. The other could be a desktop wallet.
Signing a transaction requires input from both factors.
The main advantage is that there's no need to involve a 'multisig address'. There could be a lot of other applications for something like this. For example, two-factor paper wallets.
BitID, as I understood it, adapted elliptic curve signatures to web page logins. Instead of handing over your password, you sign a message with your private key. The valid signature proves you own the private key and the site lets you enter.

Bitcoin transactions consist of a 2-part program written in a language called Script. The first part of the program locks the funds, defining a condition whereby they can be unlocked by a redeemer. The second part of the program is provided by the redeemer to satisfy the unlock condition.
The most widely used transaction pays to the hash of a public key (P2PKH, or pay-to-pubkey-hash). The payee gives the payer the hash of a public key. To unlock funds, the payee signs with the public key that hashes to the public key hash given in the unlock condition.
Pay-to-script-hash (P2SH) does something similar. The payee gives the payer the hash of a Script. To unlock funds, the payee produces an unlock script that hashes to the Script hash given in the unlock condition. This Script is then executed and must evaluate to "true" for the unlock condition to be satisfied. Relatively few limits are placed on the redemption script, making P2SH quite flexible.
Use P2SH any time the redemption logic is complicated and you don't want to burden the payer with having to work it all out. One way this is used is multisig, but multisignature transactions can also be done without P2SH.

It seems like you've got the basics down. If you're using Electrum, the recommended way to back up is to make a paper copy of your seed (or memorize it).
That way, your entire wallet, including every transaction and every address/private key you've ever used can be reconstructed on any computer running Electrum. Change addresses are all taken care of for you more or less behind the scenes.
The concept to understand is "deterministic wallets":
The problem you may run into is sharing your Electrum wallet with a mobile device. Electrum does offer an Android app, but the installation process is not for the faint of heart. I know of no other way to use an Electrum wallet on a mobile device.


Yes, there is a flaw in that it's unnecessary. Backing up the seed would require about as much effort but lets you restore the entire wallet. There's a secondary flaw in that by externalizing a private key you reduce the integrity/security of your wallet.
I don't recommend ever importing a private key into Electrum without first moving all funds at the corresponding address to an electrum receiving address, then deleting the imported private key.

Block size can be retargeted like difficulty, maybe even on the same schedule. Doing so moves the debate out of meatspace and lets nodes decide, which seems more in line with Bitcoin's ideals.
The question is what to base the target on.
The email suggests 2 options for dynamic block size targeting:
1. previous block size
2. the length of the active chain
Of the two, (1) makes most sense. As I understand it, a hard block size cap would be introduced. Find the average difference between this cap and actual block size in the previous XXX blocks. Adjust the next cap, upward *or* downward based on the average amount of unused capacity (difference between cap and block size) in the preceding blocks.
This proposal is simple, easy to understand, and easy to explain. Gavin's point about what to tell large investors who need to know how Bitcoin will scale can be answered with crystal clarity.
The proposal may also address address concerns about the economic viability of a fee market. That argument says that block space needs to be constrained in some way to encourage users to pay fees.
To constrain capacity without causing a spike in fees, retarget the floating cap slightly outside of its ideal value. When demand slackens, the cap gets cut faster than normal. When demand firms, the cap gets increased faster than normal.

Unfortunately, I don't know of any good solutions.
The simplest thing I can think of would be a setting that allows the user to prevent coin mixing. Maybe a checkbox under expert mode to the effect of "block multi-coin transactions."
Eventually, a situation will arise when the coins on hand will not make a payment possible without a multi-input transaction. Funds are still spendable, however, given a payment that's less than the largest coin on hand.
There are a couple of options at this point:
- user adds a larger coin
- user turns off the setting for this one case, then turns it back on
- user gives wallet temporary override to make payment
A temporary override could attempt to make the payment using the smallest number of coins.
These are really just half-baked ideas. I've been thinking about this for awhile now, but haven't come up with much better.
What's clear, however, is that policies based on minimizing fees or maximizing coin age will tend to leak privacy.

The network consists of nodes - and only nodes. A node is an instance of a computer program that talks to other nodes. Bitcoin Core is the de facto standard node software. A node typically connects to between 8 and ~100 peers. A peer is just another node on the network.
The process of message passing is like a game of Telephone that allows one person to talk to more than two other people.
When you "broadcast" a transaction, you're actually publishing it to a single node. That node relays the transaction to its peers. Those peers relay to their peers, and so on. The process is called *propagation*. Any node can filter any transaction it wants to, although many nodes use the Core defaults, which is to relay only "standard" transactions with sufficient relay fee or a valid fee waiver.
Some nodes are connected to mining rigs. That's how a miner gets ahold of your transaction.
Miners are 100% in charge of which transactions to filter from a block they generate. They can use any criteria they want up to and including the exclusion of all user transactions.

How confident are you that you can recover your money in the event of a catastrophic failure of any of your storage media or computers? How did you test your recovery method?
@_date: 2014-06-02 13:07:15


One factor that contributes to the security of a storage method is how likely you will be to make a mistake using it.
BIP38 requires you to *have* something (a physical medium onto which the encrypted private key is recorded) and to *know* something (the passphrase) before accessing funds.
People who tend to lose things easily will have a tough time with BIP38 because should the encrypted private key be lost, there's no way to recover it.
If you're better at remembering things, you might consider a brain wallet, but only if you take steps to make it more secure than the beginning user is likely to. Gavin Andresen has speculated on what steps might work:
Alternatively, if you have a good memory, you might think about memorizing your electrum seed. This is generally regarded as the safest form of brain wallet.
If you don't have a problem keeping physical objects safe and in order, but tend to forget passwords (such as a BIP38 password), you might consider Shamir's Secret Sharing:
Split a good, randomly-generated private key into cryptographic fragments that must be re-assembled to get the private key. You can specify a redundancy level matching your comfort level (e.g., 5 of 7, 3 of 4, etc).
@_date: 2014-11-02 18:16:34
Depends on:
- how you generate the wallet
- how you store the wallet
- whether you can remember the passphrase
- how you spend from the wallet

The short answer is "no." We will be able to see channels opening and closing, because that requires transactions to be confirmed. But the transactions that take place in-between will never be published to the block chain.
As long as a payment channel is open, the parties involved can alter the value of the channel in any way they see fit, and do so as many times as they'd like - as fast as they can manage.
It should be noted that you don't need Lightning to use Bitcoin in this way. Just set up a agreement with a trusted counterparty that you'll exchange off-chain transactions, and then settle periodically on-chain. Lightning just formalizes this system by making it much harder to cheat. This in turn opens the door to transacting in this way with parties you don't trust.


Segwit makes payment channels (i.e. Lightning) easier to implement by closing certain technical loopholes - most notably "transaction malleability."

Good point. Linking a subset of your pseudonyms together is better than linking them all, but it's a privacy leak many wallets force you to accept without your approval, or in many cases knowledge.
Good coin control features are very much lacking in most wallets. It's a critical feature for privacy.
Even with coin control, you can end up with a bunch of loose change that can't be spent without linking pseudonyms together.
A workaround would be to practice Merge Avoidance with yourself:
But as you note, that means multiple withdrawals from an exchange.
A kind of hackish workaround would be to do the split through a multi-output transaction. Make a big withdrawal from your exchange. Then, do another transaction that splits the withdrawal output into a wide assortment of denominations. You don't really lose any privacy as long as you never recombine those outputs directly or indirectly.

The main consequence is that the entire block chain would become invalid.
Each block references its parent, all the way back to the genesis block. If even one of the blocks is missing or corrupted, then the block chain can't be validated.
The only option would be to start again at block 4.
Keep in mind that there is no one block chain. There are numerous copies, distributed among each full node.
That said, this is extremely unlikely. In principle, the entire block chain can be restored from a single node.

I agree the terminology is misleading.
Nodes don't collect the relay fee even though they do the relaying. Only the miner that generates a block with the transaction and successfully propagates it can collect the fee on a transaction.
In other words, there is no special relay fee that a node collects. There is only a fee, which a node will check by default before deciding whether to relay or not.
If a sufficiently high fee is lacking, and the coins aren't of high enough "priority", then the transaction is effectively censored. Given that many nodes follow this default behavior, the result is for a zero-fee transaction to propagate poorly. It may or may not reach a miner.

In your example, the only immediate option is to combine the three coins into a multiple input transaction, and in so doing link the transactions that produced each one. If any of these previous three transactions becomes linked to your identity, this could link you personally to the other two transactions and/or the following one.
You can do slightly better by sending all three coins to a mixer. But the problem with that is that you must trust the mixer. Trust means the operator does a lot of things right 100% of the time. Good luck.
One step up from there would be to send all three coins to Shared Coin, a CoinJoin implementation from Blockchain.info that may or may not be broken, depending on who you ask.
DarkWallet is supposed to do CoinJoin mixing, but the wallet is marked as unsuitable for use on Mainnet:
The most effective and least trusting method I know of is CoinShuffle. Send the three coins in, and get three new ones back. But no wallet has implemented it, AFAIK.
Of course, none of these tools do you any good if your wallet tries to hide what's really going on behind a lick-worthy UI. You need a wallet that shows you the coins _and_ lets you decide whether and when to combine them.
It's called coin control. Bitcoin Core has implemented it, and Electrum uses a weak form:
The trend in wallets has been to dumb down and hide the protocol. I'm not sure this is a good idea. I wonder if in the fervor to make wallets simple, this important issue has been ignored, to the detriment of end user privacy.

Every node validates the block for itself. If a problem is found, the block is not relayed, and is effectively censored if enough nodes follow suit.
There's no way to tell for sure who generated a given block. The first transaction in the block, the coinbase, pays the miner. So the only option for stealing that payment is to re-do the block, which amounts to competing in the usual way.

The short answer is yes, there is a non-zero probability of not finding a block in a long time - say one day.
We can compute that as well. In one day, 144 blocks should be found on average (λ=144). We want to know the probability of finding 0 blocks in the same period (k = 0). Plugging both numbers into the equation gives a probability of:
1 in 2.9 x 10^63
For comparison, the number of Bitcoin addresses is roughly 1.5 x 10^48.
In other words, you're 10^15 times more likely to guess the next address you randomly generate with bitaddress.org than to see no blocks tomorrow.
This assumes that the network hash rate doesn't suddenly drop, of course.

You can use the number 1 as your private key. This gives you the "generator point" as your public key. It's been done before. You're much better off choosing a random private key with a good random number generator. You can do this with dice, a deck of cards, or a computer.

This technique relies on a feature called OP\_RETURN. There's more about that here:
To make a long story short, OP\_RETURN only allows you to attach 40 bytes of data to a given transaction. OP\_RETURN outputs are also special in that they're "provably unspendable", which allows certain optimizations.


Imagine every person on earth created one OP_RETURN transaction using all 40 bytes. 7 billion times 40 bytes is 280 GB if I've done the math right.
However, this doesn't even take into account the transactions that would be needed to give each person a coin to lock in this way.
Scalability is a very hot topic right now in Bitcoin. Alternative uses of the block chain like OP\_RETURN make it especially important to figure this out.

One thing to keep in mind is that putting a chain of transactions into the memory pool can lead to very slow confirmation times.
If a complete transaction chain doesn't reach a node, then orphaned transactions are dumped into the orphan pool. That pool, like the memory pool, has limited capacity.
However, the capacity of the orphan pool has a hard cap set by the maxorphantx parameter added in 0.9.3:
It's not 100% clear to me what happens when the orphan pool fills up. It looks like a random orphan is evicted.
That could lead to some unexpected behavior during times of high volume in which users are flooding the network with chains of transactions.
Edit: an "orphaned transaction" is a transaction that has no known parent, either in the block chain or in the memory pool. I believe that a transaction that descends from an orphaned transaction will also be considered an orphan.
The terminology of orphans is often used inconsistently with blocks. An "orphaned block" is a block without a parent. An extinct (or stale) block is a block on an abandoned fork. More here:

I've been struggling with this very problem myself and haven't come to any good conclusions. That said, here are some ideas:
- The receiver of your payment will always be in a position to know more than the rest of the network. AFAIK, there's no good solution. For example, buying physical goods requires reporting a physical address to deliver. The receiver can link that physical address to your Bitcoin addresses, and if evil, compile a database for distribution to interested parties. The same goes for someone who pays you. This makes buying Bitcoin from an AML/KYC liquidity provider problematic for privacy. Even more so when the provider is also a payment processor (i.e., Coinbase), because that entity can "close the loop".
- The outputs of a CoinShuffle could either be sent directly to a payee, or combined into a single coin and then this coin could later be used to make a payment. For example, you could send 5 coins into a CoinShuffle, but only collect one output. This combination might decrease the utility of the shuffle somewhat.

Under this plan, you'd only bring the "completely offline" computer online to sync the block chain for the purpose of spending. Then you'd take it offline again. Correct?
If so, the main problem is any exposure whatsoever to the network raises the risk that something you don't understand could happen. And that something could be designed to steal funds.
In other words, your system is not cold storage. For more, see:
There's another problem - backups. 
Each Bitcoin Core wallet starts with 100 addresses by default. As you spend, change is returned to an unused address in this block, and a new address is added. After 100 spends, the backups you made will no longer hold all addresses. If disaster strikes and you try to recover with the backup, you could be missing some or all of your coins. For more see:
If you're already using the full block chain, then you might as well use Armory, which was designed to do secure offline cold storage. Under this system, your offline computer is really offline. It doesn't need a network connection because the steps that need the network are done on the online computer. Transactions are signed on the offline computer.
It looks intimidating, but if you're storing anything reasonably valuable, the time you invest pays for itself.

The network is a collection of nodes, each of which is connected to a handful of peers. When a node receives a block from one peers, it relays it to its other peers.
Where a block comes from isn't important. What matters is that a new block gets relayed throughout the entire network.
Some nodes go further, trying to generate a new block by finding a proof-of-work. A node that generates new blocks is a miner. The way in which a miner finds proof-of-work varies, but usually involves hardware running custom ASIC chips - sometimes a warehouse full of them.
This is the "solve the equation" part of your question. But there is no equation. It's more like a provably fair lottery. A random number is guessed and checked. A winning guess can be communicated and checked by the network in the form of proof-of-work.
Better mining hardware means more guesses and better odds of winning.
There is no special miner protocol that the rest of the network understands. There are only nodes.

Here's a scenario that seems plausible given that transaction volume exceeds block capacity:
- The memory pool expands with the backlog of unconfirmed transactions. The memory pool is held in RAM, not on disk. The pool is wiped clean with any node crash or shutdown.
- Eventually, the growing memory pool exhausts system RAM. Behavior at this point is undefined. Maybe paging causes everything to bog down. Maybe the node just crashes.
- When a node crashes or shuts down, the memory pool disappears.
- If this process repeats itself enough, pending transactions get wiped out across the network for no obvious reason (from the perspective of the user).
- As nodes disappear, the security of the network drops with alarming speed. Maybe an enterprising user decides to test if double spending is possible.
- Suddenly, Bitcoin is in the news for all the wrong reasons. Talking heads drone endlessly about how Bitcoin is unreliable. Regulators show up to say "I told you so."
This is essentially the scenario imagined in this question:
My reading of the source code is that the behavior of a node experiencing a flood of unconfirmed transactions is undefined. Unless I'm missing something, this seems to open a hole that would be pretty cheap to exploit today.
Raising the block size to 20 MB makes the attack more difficult, but not impossible, especially if volume picks up after a block size increase.
Regardless of where the block size debate goes, a DoS failure like this seems unacceptable, especially if the problem can be easily tested and understood.

Given that it appears you haven't made the leap yet, the best advice I can offer you is to practice first.
Bitcoin is seductive in that it's easy to start using, but extremely difficult to use securely and privately. Countless stories of woe have been written over the last couple of years, and they often start where you're starting. With a lot of money, a lot of hope, frustration with the status quo, and a relatively good understanding of what Bitcoin is all about.
But that's not enough.
Security is probably the biggest problem. Of course, you need to protect funds from network-based attackers. That means cold storage, multisig, and possible a combination of the two.
The more difficult problem is protecting your funds from your own faults. Many of the worst cases have come from people who have lost private keys, sent money to the wrong address, spent huge amounts of money in mining fees, or used software that was too complicated to understand.
There's a more subtle problem that many people don't appreciate - privacy. Holding 19k (presumably dollars) on a public ledger can be dangerous to your personal safety unless you take privacy seriously.
To deal with these problems, you need to read and understand. But you also need to practice. Again. And again. The tools for using Bitcoin are in their infancy, and there are a lot of jagged edges just waiting to snag you.
Practice with chump change first. Fully work out your system for not just storing, but securely spending your funds. Prove to yourself that you know the procedures backward and forward. Then consider whether this is something you want to sink 19k into.

Address re-use is a serious privacy leak. Any casual observer can see all the payments you've previously sent or received, as well as your current balance. In extreme cases, that could lead to risks to your personal safety.
To increase privacy, a new receiving address should be used for every new inbound payment (including change).
You could generate these addresses randomly, which is what Bitcoin Core does, with real potential for failure:
Or you could generate addresses deterministically. Start with a single private key, and from that single private key, generate every new address by following a pattern that can't be deciphered from the outside. This is an HD wallet, and if you're mathematically inclined, here's an explanation of the math:
Bottom line: maintain a single private key (seed). From this seed, recover any address/private key you've previously used. On the flip side, if you lose this seed, you lose everything. That's what "back up your wallet" means - save this one private key on which the entire wallet depends.

Good to see innovations like this happening. Couple of points:
- It looks like that NFC dongle could be useful as a cold storage air gap medium. Is the NFC component off-the-shelf and if so, where do you buy them?
- If a customer without WiFi uses this, what capabilities does the wallet need to support. For example, where does the wallet get unspent outputs for making payment if there is no network? They could be cached beforehand, and I've thought of building a wallet like this, but I'm not aware of any wallets that work this way.

This would be very nice to have. I'm not sure how soon it will happen, though.
At a minimum, you need a server to listen to the network for your payment. Then, your server needs to trigger an order fulfillment. 
I can't think of a way around this because communication from the browser itself can't be trusted. The customer can send a signed transaction to the server directly. But depending on a "paid" signal from the browser would be easy to exploit.
That said, check out the link in 's post. It describes the best self-hosted merchant payment system I've seen so far, at least from the description.

A better concept to track is what it takes to run a full node, in terms of hours to set up and maintain, equipment, and ongoing charges.
As it becomes more difficult to run a full node, fewer users do so. New users are actively steered away from Bitcoin Core - it's simply not usable by most normal people. What they use instead results in decreased privacy and security, and increases centralization pressure on the network side (Coinbase and Blockchain wallets, for example).
A more centralized relay network makes it easier to block transactions, possibly even targeting specific users.

Bitcoin isn't like a lot of investments in that there isn't a very good way to value it. How do you know that $200 isn't 10x overvalued (or 10x undervalued for that matter)?
Whey you buy a government bond, for example, you can compare its rate of return to the rate of inflation. From there you can use other data to decide if you're getting a good deal.
Bitcoin needs something similar, but it's not clear what, exactly.
Until then, I'd assume it's going 10x lower in the next two years, and plan accordingly.

That dull roar you hear in the background is the Bitcoin media hype cycle firing back up.
Here's how it works:
0. Bitcoin exchange rate crashes and burns. "Real economists" scuttle out of the woodwork to blather about how they were right all along and money only comes from the government. This period can take anywhere from a few weeks to several months.
1. Bitcoin exchange rate flatlines as volatility disappears. Bitcoin disappears as a topic in the financial press.
2. Bitcoin exchange rate begins to rally for no apparent reason, or a misread of some situation (e.g., Greece).
3. One or two niche networks do a segment on Bitcoin's zombie-like powers of reanimation. Chuckles all around, and onto the next story.
4. A few viewers say "oh, what the hell" and plunk down some mad money on bitcoin.
5. The exchange rate doesn't collapse, but keeps rallying.
6. Continued advances causes more media outlets to run segments on Bitcoin ("It's not just for drugs anymore?").
7. Bitcoin coverage starts to appear on mainstream shows.
8. Exchange rate reaches levels even permabulls consider unsustainable.
9. There are 2-3 posts per day by someone intent on putting their life savings/inheritance/home equity into bitcoin.
10. Something pulls the rug out from under the market. Government crackdown in China or Russia. Management incompetence at an exchange. Failure of the Bitcoin ETF. Take your pick - the result is the same...
11. GOTO 1
Through it all, miners keep mining, the block subsidy keeps halving, developers keep pushing updates, attackers keep trying and failing to break things, and new uses for Bitcoin continue to appear.

I view usability in technical terms as well, and Bitcoin has a way to go on the usability front.
Exchange rate fluctuations go along with usability. But I don't see this as an emotional response so much as a response to a feature that seems to be broken.

The more external pseudonyms (IP address, credit card number, legal nam) that can be linked to your addresses, the easier your financial history can be tracked.
An exchange like Coinbase knows just about everything there is to know about you financially. When you make those 5 withdrawal, Coinbase knows that you personally may own the 5 new addresses.
It gets even worse with Coinbase, though, because they are also a payment processor. You may use one of those withdrawals to buy something with a Coinbase merchant. If so, you often need to supply a full legal name and shipping address. Coinbase can intercept that information and deduce what you bought with your withdrawals.

One possibility would be to use a payment channel:

Trezor can be used with wallets besides its mywallet service, in which case that wallet makes the decision.
The way outputs are chosen has a profound effect on user privacy. For example, if your wallet picks the oldest output it can find (to reduce fees), that could have you pay with high-value output. This in turn tips off your payer that you're rich, and can lead to security issues.
If the wallet prefers to combine change outputs (to keep the wallet tidy), then you're linking pseudonyms together. This negates the entire purpose of BIP 32, which is to use a separate pseudonym for each payment, and so increase user privacy.
"Coin control" lets you, the user decide. It's supported to varying degrees by Electrum, Bitcoin Core, and Armory. The 2.0 release of Electrum is supposed to work with Trezor.

To expand on 's answer...
The "light wallet" solution was actually described by Satoshi in the white paper. It's called Simplified Payment Verification, and is used by Electrum, Bread Wallet, and others.
This mode requires transactions to be downloaded from other "full nodes" on the network. Sending these transactions leaks privacy in the sense that the sending node gets to link an IP address with a set of transactions. Solutions include "Bloom filters", among others.


It's happened before. Here are some of them:

Intriguing. In a sense, the company would be using the block chain as its own public asset ledger.
On a technical level, if the company used only hierarchical deterministic (HD) wallets, published the public keys for generating them, and labelled them, then any investor could check the books (on a cash basis) at any time.
This level of transparency might be a bit too much though, because it could compromise the privacy of the company's customers.
In some ways, this would be considerably more transparency than offered by companies traded on public stock exchanges.

- How did you create the paper wallets? Was there any element of "brain wallet" to your system?
Most importantly, have your coins moved yet? It's possible that the thieves have no idea what Bitcoin is or how to use it - and never will.
And, as other commenters have suggested, did you use BIP 38 encryption on your paper wallets?

Here's a mirror image of your post that one might expect to find on Which outcomes would you prefer to see:
- either a simple block size increase through a hard fork, which is well-tested and not controversial outside of Blockstream's orbit And the activation of an ETF pushing a predicted price jump into the $2000 range and holding through end of year.
- someone tries to force the over-engineered segwit hack onto the network, burdening it with technical debt for years to come.
For the record, I don't necessarily agree with either the above characterizations (or yours). But I disagree with your methods.
First things first. The approval of the pending ETF applications has very little to do with the block size situation. It will happen or not regardless.
Second, those who favor a block size increase generally do not intend to harm the network. They're trying to save it from asphyxiation. And they see a block size increase (opening the airway) as the simplest and fastest way to do that.


You do realize how Blockstream is perceived by many Bitcoin users - right? It's seen as a company attempting to grab control of Bitcoin and monopolize its future development to its own ends.

Nobody knows for sure, but it may have to do with capitulation.
The exchange rate experienced an artificial boom caused by Gox's ridiculous trading system and the trust the community placed in it.

Whether you go with Trezor, another hardware wallet, or something like Electrum or Armory for cold storage, you'll still want to understand what you're trying to protect yourself against and how the solution you choose works at a high level.

I actually don't recommend doing this until you first understand the basics of how bitcoins are securely stored.
*A lot* of bitcoins have been lost because people didn't really understand what they were doing and locked themselves out of their own wallets:
Start by practicing with a few millibits of your coinbase holdings. Can you make a paper wallet and get bitcoin onto it? Can you sweep a paper wallet into a hot wallet? Have you found wallet software you can use and which makes sense?
Make your mistakes when little money is on the line. Believe me, there will be mistakes.
Edit: to answer your question, coinbase is a fine service, but it's also a high profile target. It could get hacked tomorrow and you'd lose your coins. Bitcoin forces you to take responsibility of your money in a way the traditional banking system doesn't. This is scary for some, but liberating to others.

Never heard of Mauldin, but this is one of the best treatments of Bitcoin I've seen.
The criticism of limited supply at the end was curious, given that it was only touched on briefly, and then only positively. Not to mention the fact that Bitcoin's money base increases to the the tune of ~10% per year and will continue to increase for longer than any of us remain alive.

Ah, right. Looks like a lot of dependent transactions were sent out by ChangeTip, without waiting for confirmations.
I've seen this resolve for two dependent transactions, but not more. AFAIK, it should eventually resolve.
The problem is that if some nodes lack a necessary intermediate, they'll reject every transaction that depends on it. If that tx is no longer being broadcast, there could be a problem.
I don't understand why ChangeTip doesn't just send a single transaction to multiple outputs.
Either way, the funds are safe - if temporarily delayed.

This is the problem in a nutshell. Buying or selling anything with bitcoin forces you to give up private information. Maybe it's your IP address. Maybe it's the product that you purchased. Maybe it's just the exact time that the transaction took place. 
By compiling these little details, and cross-linking with other data sources, it becomes possible to use the transaction graph to unmask not just those using the entry and exit gateways, but those in-between.
Privacy in Bitcoin is a collective effort. Centralized hubs following AML/KYC laws do serious harm to that effort.

It's a valid question.
The calculation is simple. Take the total miner payments (block reward + transaction fees) over a 24 hour period, and divide by the number of new transactions added to the block chain.
That gives you an effective total cost per transaction.
The debate starts when we try to interpret what this number is telling us.
The optimists might say that it shows that the network is under-used. The pessimists might say that it show the network is over-priced.
Things to keep in mind:
- The block reward will fall by 1/2 once every 4 years. The next cut will happen next year. This effectively cuts the cost/transaction for the above calculation.
- The transaction volume is growing, decreasing cost/transaction

Paper wallets serve two main purposes. First, paper wallets are an easy way for a Bitcoin user to give bitcoin to a beginner. That's a pretty big deal when you think about it. I noticed that there wasn't very good documentation for what exactly a new recipient should do with their paper wallet, so I wrote this:
The second purpose paper wallets serve is long term savings. The main concern is security. A paper wallet needs to be generated and used within a secure environment. There are simply too many attack vectors to be doing this on a network connected computer. This is where paper wallets start to break down.
After looking at this from a number of angles and trying to find the best practices from security experts, my conclusion is that Electrum set up in online/offline mode  is many times simpler to set up and administer securely. But you have to look at the whole board to see it.
One of the hidden gotchas of a paper wallet used for cold storage is making a withdrawal. Unless change goes to a new address, you leak privacy. Unless you sign from an offline environment, you could leak your private key. Secure cold storage withdrawal from a paper wallet requires a tool that doesn't yet exist.
I used to think the answer was to make that tool. But having seen how Electrum solves the problem of managing disposable keypairs, making backups by just writing down 12 words, and solving the offline signing problem, I've changed my mind.
I'm not saying Electrum is the only answer, but a deterministic wallet with offline signing capability might well be.
Standards are starting to coalesce around this idea. For example BIPs 32, 39, and 44. With the release of Trezor and integration of it into Electrum and other wallets, the right elements seem to be materializing to solve the bitcoin storage problem in a way that non technical people can actually use.
All that said, I still use paper wallets. But I'm moving that cold storage  system over to one based on a bootable DVD Linux OS and Electrum. I hope to write up the details of my system soon, maybe with a video.

A private key is neither compressed nor uncompressed. A public key, however, can be compressed.
A private key is simply a 256-bit (32-byte) number (or an integer in the range of 1 to ~10^77).
A public key is a 2-D point on an "elliptic curve". This point can be found through a one-way "multiplication" operator that finds the product of the private key with another point called the "generator".
In other words:
private key x generator point = public key
The public key has two coordinates, x and y. However, the curve of which this point is a member is vertically symmetrical. In other words, the same x value gives two y values of opposite sign.
This leads to a shortcut "compressed" notation in which the public key point is represented not by x and y coordinates, but just an x coordinate and a short flag indicating whether the point is above or below the x-axis. Instead of the normal 65-bytes needed for an uncompressed public key, a compressed public key can be represented with just 33-bytes.
Compressed public keys help make transactions smaller (and therefore reduces fees). See:
Wallet Import Format (WIF) encodes information about the public and private key. A WIF starting with "5" means that the public key is uncompressed. A WIF starting with "K" or "L" means that the public key is compressed. Both WIF types can result in nearly the same number of characters because the public key itself isn't part of the data. The WIF only encodes the private key and whether compression is being used or not.  (A WIF using compression actually requires an additional byte, so ironically the "compressed" WIF is usually longer).
A curious sidebar: the same private key actually encodes two different addresses. One address is derived from the compressed form of the public key, and the other is derived from the uncompressed form of the public key. An outside observer has no way of knowing that both addresses are controlled by the same private key - until transactions are signed against both forms.
There's some more info on private keys here:
Edit: this graphical calculator helps explain what's going on visually:

The bigger question is why? Did you have a particular application in mind?
@_date: 2015-01-22 14:47:29
The private key isn't used for encryption. It's used instead to sign a specially formatted message called a transaction. That takes care of authentication.
However, authorization still remains to be done. In other words, just because you can sign with a private key doesn't give you the right to transfer ownership of a coin.
That happens through a custom programming language called Script. Two transactions form a chain. The first transaction locks a coin with a challenge script. The second transaction uses a signature to unlock the coin with a response script. If the response signature matches the requirements of the challenge, then the transaction is valid. Otherwise it's invalid.

It's a way for two or more users to control access to the same locked funds.
You can think of it in terms of a joint checking account (the internals are different, but outcome is similar). Alice and Bob are married and have a joint checking account. Either Alice or Bob can sign a valid check or withdraw funds. This is analogous to a "1-of-2 multisig address".
Bitcoin steps this up a notch. For example:

A lot of the concern around wallets boils down to random number selection for private keys and signatures.

Not necessarily, but it can.
For example, if the software that signs your transaction does so with a bad random number generator, an attacker can trivially discover your private key. This is what Johoe did recently to bc.i wallets:
This also can compromise your privacy:
For example, if you lock the test payment to a public key you already own, then that creates a link that *could* be used to de-anonymize you down the road.
If you want to prove that your private key works as it should, a better way to do it might be to sign a message (offline), then verify that signed message with another piece of software.
For example, MultiBit can do this:

Privacy: You have the ability to selectively reveal information about yourself.
Anonymity: You interact with other users without using a name, legal or assumed. It's impossible to link any communication to you because the system doesn't use names.
Pseudonymity: You interact with other users through an assumed name (think Reddit). The decision to link this name with your personal identity is up to you (privacy). Sometimes your actions will create this link unintentionally (privacy leak).

I find the tricky part for many beginners is understanding what it is that miners do exactly. This is one of the first questions because it's what the media presents in most of its stories (and gets quite wrong).
The reason it's so hard to understand the need for miners and mining is that the concept of "electronic cash" is not even considered, is fuzzy, or downright misunderstood. Although many people use physical cash, it doesn't occur to them that it could be possible to create an electronic form of it with many of the same properties (and some important advantages):
Understanding the basic idea of electronic cash makes it far easier to understand the need for double spending protection, which is what miners actually do.

It can. However, chaining several unconfirmed transactions together was recently reported here (can't find link) to delay confirmation. For any one of the transactions to be confirmed its immediate parent must also be confirmed, or appear in the same block. If that parent doesn't appear in the miner's memory pool at the time the block is created, then the child will be considered invalid and another miner will have to confirm both transactions (or the parent first).

You approach a guard at a security gate. The guard asks for your ID. You give it to him.
First, the guard checks to make sure the ID is real, and that the photo matches your face. This is *authentication*. In Bitcoin authentication is what public/private keys, signatures, and elliptic curve cryptography are for.
If authentication fails, the guard doesn't listen to you anymore.
If authentication succeeds, the guard checks to make sure your name is on the list of people allowed to enter. This is *authorization*. In Bitcoin, authorization is done by a two-part program written in the Script language.
Previously, Bitcoin's robotic guards only came in a few models, all created from the same basic parts. But using Script as designed lets you create a wide range of guards by yourself - without asking anyone's permission.
You can make a guard that lets anyone through the gate (no authentication). Or a guard that lets only those through who know a secret. Most guards will use an ID check. But some will only accept  IDs issued to a group of people. Advanced guards can respond to different conditions at the time ID is presented.

Dynamic block sizing is an interesting idea. A block size that could respond to prevailing conditions would remove the "lever" that's causing so much meatspace consensus difficulty right now. Setting the policy in code seems like a more viable strategy than debating it every XX months.
The question is what to target. With difficulty, the target is easy: you want on average 1 block every ten minutes.
But what do you target with block size?
It looks like this proposal targets fee density (fee/kilobyte). That's an interesting metric because it combines the two values that much of the debate seems to revolve around: block size and fees.
This proposal seems to penalize miners who generate blocks with high fee density, while rewarding those who generate blocks with low fee density (the -fee/kilobyte term).
I'm not sure about the problem this solves, though. A miner can fill a block with garbage data without paying a penalty by ensuring that the garbage transactions include a self-payable fee with the correct density.
As far as I can tell, this proposal doesn't prevent a miner from doing what a hard block size limit is designed to prevent. It will always be easy to game the system by making the fees in your blocks payable to yourself.
Still, the idea of algorithmically targeting block size and fees is a very interesting one.

You mentioned one of them - a safety deposit box. Another is your brain, which works for an Electrum seed mnemonic, for example. It's actually easier to memorize a list of words than you might think. Here's one system:
Another is to use Shamir's Secret Sharing. Cryptographically split the seed into m-of-n shares and spread them around the house. The thief needs to collect m shares to generate the seed mnemonic.
Either way, some very strongly recommend an unencrypted paper backup as an essential part of using Bitcoin. Store it in a safe place as a last resort fallback.
But you're right - this is a lot of effort and not what a lot of people will be willing to do.

My understanding of merge avoidance is to avoid ever having a 1500 BTC output in your wallet in the first place.
For example, let's say you fund a cold storage wallet through a withdrawal from a liquidity provider. Your balance is 1500 BTC. How do you withdraw funds?
Using merge avoidance, you'd spread your withdrawal over several days/weeks, and use a different address for each withdrawal. Each withdrawal amount would be less than the threshold you'd want to be found out to own.
Then, when you top up a hot wallet, use one of these smaller outputs to fund the transaction. Even if the sandwich shop owner sees your address and traces it to the cold storage address, he only sees a small output.

A block consists of two detachable parts: a header and a body. The body is an ordered list of transactions. The header is a collection of values.
One of the most useful values in a header is the ID of the previous, or parent block. This parent-child relationship allows blocks to be assembled into a chain. It also provides a tamper resistance mechanism.
Another useful property in the header is a nonce (number used once). This is a value that when inserted into the header causes it to give a hash value within a target range. The nonce is a "proof of work".
To answer your questions, yes, miners decide which transactions go into a block. This is done before the proof of work is calculated.

Assuming all public keys used on the block chain today were created with perfect random number generators, and that all signatures used the same perfect random number generators, and that all software used for making transactions was perfectly created and rigorously reviewed, the answer is for practical purposes "never".

Bitcoin could end up as a technological dead end if it failed to continue evolving.
The problem is that the more widespread Bitcoin use becomes, the more pressure there is to avoid making big changes. Witness the strong differences of opinion over block size, something that seems simple on the surface:
Bitcoin's main advantage over all of the alternatives right now is network effect. Ironically, this same advantage could be its fatal flaw.
That said, I'm optimistic that Bitcoin will continue to evolve through competition. For example, when Ethereum goes live, it will spur a flurry of activity around smart contracts and smart property. Some of the things people do with Ethereum will be far beyond what's possible with Bitcoin. Some of those things will simply be too useful for Bitcoin to ignore.
That frames the debate  in a very stark way. Either we try to keep up with competing alternatives that prove themselves or we stagnate. Without that competition, there's little motivation to innovate.

As says, stealth addresses tend to be most useful for those situations in which payer and payee aren't in direct communication.
For example, you run a website that takes donations. You'd like to publish a single donation address/QR code because that's easy and makes sense. However, doing this erodes your own privacy and that of your donors, because all payments flow through the same address. So you post a stealth address instead.
A stealth address works like an inverted HD wallet, in which the payee, not the payer, determines the key pair offset for each payment. The offset is communicated to the payer as a Diffie-Hellman shared secret stored on the block chain. The payer needs to scan the block chain to find the shared secret, decode it, and generate the key pair that will unlock the payment. 
Over Skype, PGP would also work as a way for the payer to communicate the payment address. The advantages over an elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman exchange are twofold:
- arbitrary data can be encrypted
- payer and payee will have likely already verified each other's PGP identities
That said, you raise an interesting point.

With a high enough fee, yes. 546 satoshis (0.00000546 BTC) is all it would take to get your transaction over the "dust limit":

No. I was referring to emotionally motivated opponents. The OP used the word "hate", so my comments refer to "some" of the people I've come into contact with who express emotionally-based negative positions.
These kinds of positions can't be refuted because they're based on belief. FWIW, positive statements about Bitcoin based on emotion also can't be refuted. Both have limited use.
That said, there have been a number of technically-based critiques of Bitcoin. I've made a number of them myself. Many core developers have as well. These critiques can be debated because they're based on observation and understanding (sometimes misunderstanding as well), not emotions.
I've tried to understand the emotionally-motivated critics as well as I can, and this is one category I've come up with.
There's another category that primally loathes "hard money", and deflation of any kind. For them Bitcoin represents an economic step backward. It's very hard to discuss Bitcoin with them because their beliefs are rooted in poorly-tested economic hypotheses.

Brazil and China nodes each get a transaction spending the same output in different ways. Eventually each node learns of the other's transaction. However, these transactions are rejected from each node's respective memory pool as a double spending attempt.
Either China or Brazil solves the next block. The winner adds its copy of the transaction.
If the next block is solved by completely different node, it adds the copy of the transaction it received first.
It's important to realize, though, that memory pool policies can differ widely across the network. For example, if a second transaction is seen with a higher fee than the first, a node can choose to keep it, ejecting the original transaction from the memory pool:

I would start with the problem Bitcoin solves, and work from there. This would be one way to get the ball rolling:
[Pull a recognizable foreign bank note from your wallet and show it to the court.]
This paper bank note is a token that I can give to any one of you as payment. You may not accept it, but others would - especially the people of [country]. You may prefer one of these instead.
[Pull a high-denomination domestic bank note from you wallet and show it to the court.]
I can pay you for something simply by giving you one of these tokens. I can't take back my payment without taking back the token. Whichever one of us controls the token owns its value. After I give you the token, you can use it to pay someone else, and so on. We call this form of money "cash".
Cash works fine for face-to-face payments, but doesn't work well on the Internet. There's no way for me to send you this exact bank note through my computer. I can indirectly send it by going to a bank and asking to make a wire transfer. But this takes time and can be expensive, especially for small payments.
What we need is cash made not from paper, but from electronic data. If bank notes were computer files, then they could be sent anywhere in the world at almost no cost nearly instantly. It would be cash for the Internet.
For years many people tried to create an electronic form of cash. The most obvious problem was forgery. If a bank note becomes a computer file, what prevents anyone from creating fakes?
The solution came from clever math that allows the creator of a computer file to prove that she is the author. You use similar technology when you log into a secure web site.
There's another, less obvious problem. What prevents me from using the same computer file to pay many different people? After all, it's easy to create exact copies of any file.

The best business ideas in Bitcoin are going to sound stupid for a long time.
The reason is that new technologies like Bitcoin grow at the margins before they invade the mainstream. But the margins have limited profit potential. So people stay away and work on things that seem like they can deliver fatter returns. This is a mistake.
Pick an economically marginalized group - any group. Ensure that the members of this group have ready access to the Internet and at least smartphone-level hardware.
Pick the biggest PITA this group has when it comes to money, then build a solution that solves it using Bitcoin.
For example, kids who want to buy video games might have money, but not a credit card. Prepaid debit cards often can't be used online. Solve that problem.
Or, pot shops in CO and OR can't get bank accounts because national banks are too scared to work with them. Solve that problem.
Or, paycheck loans gouge customers, keeping them in an endless cycle of debt. Solve that problem.
As your solution becomes *the* solution for a very small group, you'll find other groups who can also use it (with some adaptation). Expand into these new areas when the business is mature enough to handle it. Iterate.

There are at least two responses to this problem:
1. Implement intelligent fee selection in the Blockchain Wallet products, or give users the tools necessary to estimate the going fee rate themselves.
2. Lament how some "developers working on Bitcoin Core," apparently acting against broad community support, have derailed Satoshi's vision.
Unfortunately, the author chooses to engage in the same tactics used by too many others: blame it all on the Core Developer Conspiracy.
Blockchain, look to yourself and ask what you could begin working on today to bring those transaction delay tickets down to normal. Will blaming others get you there? Or maybe, just maybe, you could apply a small portion of the investor money you've collected toward solutions that can help users today.
Even a hard fork update to 2 MB (followed very shortly thereafter by yet another round of block size whack-a-mole) will not eliminate the need to take the going fee rate into account. There will always be another "stress test" to make those delay tickets pile up.

From the blog post:


The video show a fee of 0.01 mBTC, or 1000 satoshis. So, a total cost to the user is 6460 satoshis.
That will get the transaction propagated through default 0.9 nodes, but I'm not sure how likely confirmation will be. Has anyone looked at this recently?
If the tx is never confirmed, the spammer loses no money and can flood the network with these transactions.

Sounds like a problem primed for a Bitcoin solution. It's good to see companies linking up services in that area.

Which system were you thinking of using to accept payments?
Depending on how sophisticated you want to get, this should be possible. It could be as simple as watching a block explorer, then checking the fee manually. Or it could involve custom software that checks the fee (and other parameters) before giving the green light.
My understanding is that BitPay and Coinbase handle these checks for you.

A full node accepts incoming connections as well as making outgoing connections. It also relays newly-received payments and blocks.
A solo miner does all of that in addition to attempting to find new blocks.

The owner of a coin is defined by the last entry in a chain of ownership. For example, Bob receives a coin from Alice, who receives it from Charles, a miner. Bob is the owner of the coin until he spends it. The chain of ownership is a sequence of backlinked transactions flowing like this:
    Charles -&gt; Alice -&gt; Bob


Yes. To send the coin to Bob, Alice needs to create a transaction with an input. This input links to the output in the transaction that Charles used to give her the coin.


Alice creates a digital signature from her private key and the transaction. (Technically, she also needs a random number to sign, but that's not critical here.)


The signature proves Alice is the intended recipient of the coin.


No. The transaction only carries Alice's signature, not the private key.
Things are actually more complicated than this simple model. When a transaction is validated, a small, two-part program is run. The first part of the program comes from the transaction input, and it generally contains the public key and signature. The second part comes from the output that the input links to. It ensures that the correct steps are taken to validate the signature and public key.
You can play around with this programming language, confusingly named "Script", here:

Fear of the deflation bogeyman, and misguided policy reactions to it, got the world's central banks into their current predicament. Too often, the speculative bubbles leading up to these events only register as footnotes.

Has a BIP been drafted on the subject of increasing the block size limit? I didn't find one here:
A lot of the discussion so far has been philosophical. That's fine, but it will only go so far. To move this idea beyond philosophy, wouldn't it help to have a specific proposal to work from?
A BIP could help in three ways:
1. Provide a specific proposal to evaluate for completeness and suitability in solving the problem.
2. Provide a specific implementation to test and evaluate.
3. Set a precedent for how difficult decisions get made in the future.
Of the these points, (3) could be the most important in the long run. This isn't just a technical problem, but an organizational problem as well.

I guess I'm disagreeing with the author about what's needed. Bitcoin isn't like most open source projects, so their models of success may not apply.
For example, there have been calls for Gavin to act like the "benevolent dictator" that many successful open source projects seem to have. Linux and Python come to mind.
Imagine how that would play out in Bitcoin with its emphasis on decentralization, and bad memories of the Foundation. Maybe it would work, but it could also fail badly.
One of the things that makes Ethereum interesting is that they've baked the governance model into the cake. We'll see how that plays out.
Bitcoin is forging a different model, for better or worse. It seems that blog posts, mailing, lists and even Reddit posts will be the way this works for some time.

Bitcoin is neither, but has properties of both.
People are going to struggle for a long time on this one. For some reason, a certain segment fixates on this question and uses it to craft bizarre arguments based on analogy. Old-guard economists may never get it.
Bitcoin is something fundamentally new. Its closest relative is cash:
@_date: 2015-01-15 22:23:15


Some view that as a feature, not the lack of a feature.
Bitcoin is an "electronic cash system." That term is easy to gloss over (and many do), but it's the key to understanding the entire system:
Consider how you'd implement recurring payments if all you had to work with was paper bank notes.
You could automate the payments, but that requires a special trusted someone to bill you on the merchant's behalf. And that's basically a credit card or PayPal.
You could just pay for a longer period (say, one year), rather than a month. Then the service would remind you when you subscription is up. 
Or if you had electronic cash, you could use a programmable money approach like a payment channel:
Usually payment channels are though of as short term, but they can be used over any term. I've never seen anybody turn a payment channel into a monthly subscription, and it may not work, but it's an interesting idea.

Agree in the context of hard forks. Not so sure about soft forks, though.
Still, this is probably the most radical idea behind Bitcoin. It's amazing and scary at the same time once the realization hits. I suspect that's where a lot of the anger around the block size limit comes from. There doesn't seem to be anybody who can consider and act on a plea for mercy.

@_date: 2015-01-19 18:37:08
Yes, it erodes your own privacy and that of your transaction partners.
Linking personal information to an address allows an investigator to link transactions directly to you. In doin so, it becomes easier to identify you counter parties.
That said, some want this. For example non profits seeking transparency.
However, leaks in privacy can lead to security problems.if I know how you use money, I can plot an attack against you more easily.

I'm not 100% clear about what you did, but one thing to be sure of is that you aren't looking at a change address:
MultiBit in particular is a weird beast. If a wallet contains one address, it returns change to that address. If a wallet contains two addresses, change will move back and forth between them.
Could that explain what you saw?
@_date: 2015-01-12 16:17:01
Having tried all of the wallets myself, and helped countless new users navigate the choices, I'd say Electrum offers the best compromise between ease of use and functionality.
It won't win any UI design prizes, but everything you need is there, and there's a lot more power under the hood. I wrote this guide to help beginners get started with it:

As the node count decreases, it becomes easier for a single group to block transaction propagation, even targeting specific users. The lower the ability of a transaction to propagate, the less likely it is that a miner will see it in the first place.

As others have noted, calculating hash values (the thing miners do) has few other well-known applications. However, this is actually a very good question and someone may actually find a use.

Regarding false dichotomy - that's an idea worth looking at carefully.
There's been a lot of technical/economic discussion about whether Bitcoin can function as *both* a censorship resistant monetary sovereignty tool and a large scale general-purpose payment network. But the ratio of hard data to speculation and/or imperfect models on this topic is pretty low IMO. If the answer to this question were clear, then so would be the path forward.
It may be that the only way to settle this issue is to run the experiment. Let the hard fork happen. Let both coins co-exist. Let the full security, censorship, and economic implications of both ideas be vigorously tested in a real-world setting.
Taking this position eliminates the need for any further jawboning. Let those in favor of a hard fork give it their best shot. The worst that can happen is that a stronger system emerges when all the dust has settled.

Sounds interesting. What's the problem this solves, or the new capability it adds?
@_date: 2015-01-23 21:42:39
Electrum downloads block headers. Think of headers as the block chain, but without all of the transactions.
Headers use something called a Merckle root, which allows you to prove that any set of transactions either did or didn't belong to a particular block.
Electrum only downloads those transactions that are relevant to a particular wallet.
Bitcoin Core 0.10 introduced a new way to download the block chain called "headers first", which closely resembles this way of downloading the block chain. Core goes further though, and downloads every transaction.
The overall idea is called SPV:
A discussion can be found in section 8 of the white paper:

I'm not aware of any report of BitPay actually sharing customer data. But from what I understand, they're obligated to share data with law enforcement and other state/federal agencies if asked. An of course, they can be hacked, resulting in a different kind of "sharing".

A private key's main job is to sign a transaction, which is just a specially formatted message.
So if you can sign a message (it could be plain text) in a way that another piece of software recognizes as valid, that's about as good as you can get.
Unfortunately, there aren't many good ways to do this that I'm aware of.
You'll want to sign your message offline, though. That means that the computer you're using has never been, and never will be, connected to the Internet. The stringency of this requirement depends on how highly you value your funds. At least match whatever system you used to create the keys.
One signing tool is MultiBit:
It's cumbersome because you need to import the private key first, while offline, of course.
Once signed, you can check the signature either with MultiBit, or some online services. One of them would be:
which can be run offline.

I don't want to discourage you from doing what you're doing, but if you saw as many folks lose their money by buying too much too quickly, before actually understanding how to secure their funds, you might be cautious as well.
There's a simple test you give yourself to know if you're ready to hold a significant amount of your net worth in Bitcoin. Do you understand cold storage? Have you worked through a cold storage system?

I think you're thinking about the fee waiver.
As a rule of thumb, a one bitcoin output can be spent without a fee one day after receiving it.
Given that a satoshi is 1/100,000,000 of a bitcoin, the output would have to sit for 100 million days.
However, the main problem is that the transaction spending one satoshi would be considered dust, and so rejected by default nodes:
The other problem is that other rules apply to be eligible for the fee waiver. One of them is that all outputs must be &gt; 0.01 BTC.
One bit is 100 satoshis, which would cut your wait time to 1 million days, assuming the dust limit were lowered by a lot and the minimum output size was updated.

When you look at your transaction on blockchain.info, is one of the "to" amounts less than ~0.000055 BTC?
@_date: 2015-01-01 16:28:36
In principle, yes, you could print your own petty cash "bills". This would be helpful in those situations where the merchant has internet connectivity, but the customer doesn't. The merchant would simply scan the private key and software would take care of the rest, including change. AFAIK, this software/system doesn't exist.
Unfortunately, the brick and mortar merchants I've visited who take bitcoin seem to just barely handle a payment with a phone. Staff forget how to accept a bitcoin payments, and it sometimes seems like just a big hassle for them.
I wish it weren't this way, but it's understandable. Juggling two different POS systems is not easy.
In other words, there's no technical limitation preventing paper wallets from working for small transactions, but the organizational challenges would be enormous.
Developing a standard around the idea could help, but this would only appeal to a fraction of current Bitcoin users, I'm afraid.

Transactions contain embedded programs written in a custom language:
The scope of the language is limited. Still, very powerful things can be done with it. During the first five years of its existence, Script was mostly disabled, and standard transactions could only use a small subset of the language. Recent releases have exposed more functionality. This opens up unprecedented opportunities for fully automated, brokerless financial services.

Theoretically, it's possible that BIP 38 could disappear. However, it's a standard written in enough detail, with enough test cases, to be re-implemented by a competent programmer.
To be safe, it might be a good idea to store a copy of bitaddress.org with your BIP 38 private key.
An alternative would be to ditch individual private key management and use something like Electrum for cold storage. It's not that much harder than paper wallets used securely, and solves problems paper wallets don't do in an integrated way (such as secure spending).

Very good question.
This looks helpful:
- Find two points R, R' that have the value r as x-coordinate.
- Compute r^-1, the multiplicative inverse of r
- compute z, the lowest n bits of the hash of the message, where n is the bit size of the curve.
- The two possible public keys are r^-1 (sR - zG) and r^-1 (sR' - zG)
As for a visualization, I'm not sure there's a good one. I would begin by trying to rearrange the equations to define r and s such that I could express them in terms of R, R', r^-1 , and z.

Thanks, yes, I saw that.
I was thinking more along the lines of an actual network simulation, with several dozen or so nodes running Bitcoin Core 0.10.1 on a private network (not testnet).
Hit this network with a variety of transaction loads, watch what happens, then report the results. In some scenarios, assume that users and node operators will respond in the worst possible ways to slow confirmation times and overflowing memory pools. Clear the network state (shutdown nodes, reset block chain/memory pool) between trials.
What previously unknown vulnerabilities are opened? What happens to network fees in the various scenarios? Is there an as yet hidden self-healing mechanism? How do the results differ from mathematical the model you cited, if at all?
The block size increase proposal will continue to be controversial until it becomes crystal clear that the consequences of doing nothing are:
1. tangible
2. very harmful to the network
I'm not sure that this case has been made well enough. But I like to think that most parties involved would respond to hard experimental data.

I hope that was a misquote. Who can "fire" a self-selecting group of volunteers? Before answering, consider how that power could be abused by the one(s) doing the "firing."
Here's the more likely scenario. The timing and magnitude of the block size limit increase will be bikeshedded to death. It's something everyone seems to have an opinion about and no problem expressing, regardless of their level of knowledge/skill in software development and economics. Today there are a handful of contending hard-fork altcoins (two of which Gavin had a hand in creating). Six months from now, how many will there be?
For now, there doesn't appear to be cross-project competition or animosity. But given past experience with the heated, angry, very personal nature of the discussion of *whether* to raise the limit, it seems entirely possible that work on resolving *how* to raise the limit could devolve quite quickly as well.
Although the block size limit was a topic as early as 2011, it was Mike Hearn's article describing an imminent catastrophe that really got the pot boiling:

It's not widely known, but you can download Bitcoin Core, change a few settings, and start mining off of the Genesis Block. Using a regular CPU, you can mine as many blocks as you want. It's actually pretty fun.
How much value do those coins have? Of, course nothing. The reason? Nobody will accept them as payment.
So it would be with a hard fork that raises the block reward. Miners would mine this useless altcoin and nobody would care. The value wouldn't be anything close to Bitcoin's current value.
Meanwhile, the miners who stayed with the current subsidy schedule would benefit from reduced competition and the ability to get full price for each 25-bitcoin block reward.
Not long after the experiment began, it would fall apart as one miner after the other saw how they were wasting money and returned to the main chain.
At least, that's what would happen today. In the future, users may be willing to tolerate a block reward increase to support network security. Why? There could be many reasons, but they would all boil down to something along the lines of miners leaving the network due lack of profitability. It would be easy to recognize the situation because double spending of confirmed transactions would be commonplace.
Under those conditions, it's not hard to imagine a group of well-meaning folks deciding to raise the block reward and abandon the 21 M cap in the interest of saving Bitcoin.

Network security is currently paid for by money supply growth, as described in the link.
Low transactions fees are possible thanks to money supply growth, which is given to miners as the block subsidy. Money supply growth makes Bitcoin less scarce, and so less valuable than it would otherwise be - at least to a first approximation.
The block subsidy is a hidden fee that will disappear over time, leaving the question of who pays for securing the network. Consumers who pay for goods with VISA also pay a fee, but it's levied by the merchant.
I was agreeing with you, but noting that Bitcoin fees are also hidden to consumers.

Most convenient: BitPay or Coinbase
That said, merchants who do this face an uphill battle of ensuring their staff understand how to accept a payment. For many of the physical merchants I've paid at, accepting Bitcoin appears to be a major PITA. It's rarely used, and so staff forget how to take payment that way. The fact that the Bitcoin POS is not integrated into the regular POS just makes matters worse.
BitPay and Coinbase are bank-like institutions. They must comply with a ream of laws, and will deny service for any number of reasons. So...
Most independent: Set up your own payment gateway and take your own payments. Unfortunately, this is likely to require custom software at the moment.

A soft fork can be implemented by a majority of the network hash power. This is how P2SH (multisig) was rolled out.
A hard fork requires the consent of every single network node. Those who don't consent are forked off the network. A hard fork has never happened in Bitcoin (depending on who you talk to), and as such has many unknowns associated with it. Soft forks have been done before.

That helps, but doesn't solve the problem completely.
For example, your private key could be sent to the attacker, who could create and sign a transaction before you. This would, in effect, make your transaction a double spend attempt, and therefore invalid.

The money stock grows at a rate of ~3,600 BTC per day. If you make a plot of money stock vs. time, you get a line with a slope of 3,600 BTC/day.
Every four years, the slope of this linear growth rate is decreased by a factor of 2.
In other words, within a 4-year epoch, money stock grows with a linear absolute rate.

The part where this story goes off the rails for me is this:


Bitcoin's defining characteristic is its lack of central control. Central banks are all about central control. So the idea that a central bank digital currency would compete in any way with Bitcoin only makes sense if you don't understand what makes Bitcoin useful in the first place.
Case in point:


Which leaves me puzzled about these recent stories about the Bank of England. It has put out some good documentation on digital currencies in the past:
But at the same time, we have articles like the OP describing essentially a cargo cult response.
On the other hand, viewing digital currencies as a way to consolidate central bank control (lenders keeping money at the central bank itself, cutting out the middle man) seems perfectly logical. It may even work.

If you mean "why doesn't it run in a browser", I think one of the answers would be:
Because browsers (still) can't directly connect to the Bitcoin network. If you tried to make a browser-based app that talked to the Bitcoin network, traffic would need to flow through trusted servers which forwarded traffic to full or SPV nodes.
In other words, it's technically impossible to write a full or SPV node ("light wallet") in JavaScript and run it in an unmodified browser. There are ways to change this situation, but they'd require a new browser-compatible protocol.
Note that there's no problem at all writing downloadable JavaScript apps that you run in a browser. The issue is that the browser itself has no way to communicate using the Bitcoin network protocol.

The things I want most to see have to do with basic infrastructure. If done right, this infrastructure cuts middlemen (i.e., you) out of the loop, so you might not be able to make your money back directly. But it may be possible with some creativity.

It's based on something called a payment channel:


The central feature is a transaction that the user sends directly to a service, not to the Bitcoin network. The user updates the transaction periodically, to give the service more money. The updates are send directly from the user to the service, again bypassing the Bitcoin network.
When the user is done, the channel is closed. The final version of the transaction is then broadcast by the service. The user collects any change and the service collects its payment.

Bitcoin uses *cryptography*. There are two main branches of that field:
- encryption: keeping others from viewing content
- authentication: allowing others to verify content
Bitcoin uses authentication, but not encryption. Places you'll find authentication:
- private keys/digital signatures
- linked block headers, forming a block chain
- linked transactions, forming a chain of ownership
- transactions bundled into a tree of hashes
In short: hashes are used in multiple subsystems. Digital signatures are used to unlock coins.
Encryption isn't anywhere to be found. However, you can optionally encrypt traffic to a server, but that's well outside the protocol. This is how Electrum and Blockchain.info work, for example.

as if it were somehow special. In a truly decentralized system, it would not be.
In a sense, all lukejr has done is to exercise his right to interpret the Bitcoin protocol as he sees it.
However, Gentoo users most likely expect to see a binary that reflects the GitHub repository, not a fork.
I think it's important to be honest with new users that some parts of Bitcoin are centralized. This is one example.

For those who say this has nothing to do with Bitcoin, it has everything to do with Bitcoin. People often point to Bitcoin and ask what it's good for given easy access to banking and other services in rich countries. One use is to protect your own money from those who want to steal it from you.
The IRS was able to take the money because the money didn't belong to Lyndon McLellan. The money belonged to his bank, which gave it to the IRS.
If you exercise good operational security with Bitcoin, those intent on stealing your money won't even know it exists. If you fail to take privacy seriously, you can become a target of extortion and other shenanigans by criminals and governments. This is why Bitcoin needs to be used with privacy in mind from the beginning.
But - if you store "your" Bitcoin with a third party, that party owns your Bitcoin, not you. And that party can be coerced into compliance with even illegal policies. The same thing that happened to McLellan can happen to you.

There are two risks you run:
1. Compromise of your private key now or at any time in the future means you can lose everything.
2. You're leaking private information with every transaction. Your balance and transactions are an open book to anyone you transact with.

Yes, it's possible.
Users leak privacy all the time without realizing what's happening.
Consider buying something online with BitPay. You check out, giving your street address and name. Then you make a payment.
BitPay has just linked your legal identity with your payment address(es). It probably also knows your IP address. What BitPay does with this information is anyone's guess. Being fully AML/KYC compliant puts BitPay in the awkward position of potentially turning this information over to regulators, attackers, and snoops.
That information can be used against you now, or in the distant future.
This applies to anyone you make a payment to or accept a payment from. If they know who you are, they can break your pseudonymity. Centralization compounds the problem by orders of magnitude.

They will eventually fall out of memory pools and the network will forget about them. It will be as if no transactions were sent.
Avoid sending transactions whose inputs link to unconfirmed outputs (in other words, one unconfirmed transaction after another). Confirmation of such a chain requires that *every* transaction end up at the same node, which is less likely than just one doing so.
Finally if your wallet is clueless about fees, use this before sending anything:

Bitcoin worked exactly as intended.
Users paying a competitive fee got next block confirmation. Users paying less got less certainty and slower confirmation. The increase in fees raised the price of continuing the test, and in all probability throttled the propagation of low fee transactions.
It used to be difficult for users to avoid address reuse. MultiBit Classic, for example, used a single address, leading to massive privacy leak.
Wallet makers stepped up and implemented the BIP 32 family of standards. We need something like that for fees.
The problem seems solvable.
@_date: 2016-03-01 16:11:42
Yes, that's important to consider.
But it's also important to consider the droves of new users who have been turned away from the using the most private, secure wallet option (Bitcoin Core/full node) due to day-long initial synchronization and hour-long restart synchronization.
Also consider the increasing price of hosting a full node.

An audience member asked for evidence during Q&amp;A. In a bizarre twist, James said he knew of none. He then challenged the questioner to tell him why Satoshi had them (or something like that).
In other words, the "numerous 51% attacks" thing has nothing to back it.
Giving the benefit of the doubt, I interpret this as James putting forward a thought experiment about the role of identity in decentralization. Unfortunately, he presented the part about 51% attacks as fact on both Twitter and during the presentation itself.

That's an issue with Coinbase. Actually, it's an issue with many exchanges, which often batch transactions moving funds back onto the block chain together, then send.

Step 1 will be a solution to the secure storage problem. Without a way for a nontechnical user to securely store funds, talk about Bitcoin as a worldwide monetary system is just that - talk.
Cold storage is simply too complicated for any reasonable random non-technical person to expend the effort.
I'm very encouraged by what I'm seeing from multisig. Services like Greenaddress.it and  have a lot to offer. I suspect the basic idea of spreading spending authority out over multiple devices/factors will continue to advance.
We'll know we're there when nobody talks about cold storage anymore. It will just taken for granted that your funds aren't moving unless you move them. Not unlike how we now assume the internet/phone/car will work when we need it to.
Step 2 will be a clear answer to the question: why bother? Bitcoin needs to find solutions to problems that are impossible or very impractical to solve by any other means. Simply being a competitor to PayPal/Credit Cards is a losing proposition.
I'm thinking about things like Lighthouse (crowdfunding), Proof of Existence (timestamping), tradable asset coins (Counterparty/Colored Coins/MasterCoin), and distributed, trustless markets (OpenBazaar).
These two steps are likely to advance in parallel. If you have any interest/experience in either of them, one suggestion would be to contact the projects and offer to either help write or test new software and/or write documentation.

Respectfully disagree. Paper wallets (as gifts, and increasingly from ATMs) will ensure that *sweeping* private keys into software wallets will be important form some time.
The major software wallets have generally ignored this important use case, resulting in end-user hacks resulting in lost/stolen funds.
IMO, every software wallet should support a sweep feature. Importing keys, on the other hand, should be hidden away and only available to experts.

Here's one that came close:
Not sure if any funds were lost, but there's every possibility that it could have happened.
As for SPV nodes, one risk is that a peer can "lie by omission." That means that your peer can withold transactions from you, tricking you into thinking that a coin hasn't been spent. This mainly affects unconfirmed transactions, but could also come into play during a chain split.
Again, I'm not saying Web wallets or SPV wallets are inherently insecure. And you're right in that the difficulty in finding clear-cut cases suggests this may not matter in practice. But by relaxing the security and privacy model, you're unavoidably exposing yourself to risks.
As for privacy in particular, there's ample evidence that SPV nodes leak private information. For example:
Electrum in particular sends all public keys to the server you connect to. There are ways to improve that privacy model, but they aren't easy to implement and basically involve running your own Electrum server/full node combo.

This is the fundamental problem. And it's far from theoretical, as anyone who has recently tried to start a full node from scratch knows all too well. I know because I've lost count of the number of posts here and elsewhere that start with "I just set up Bitcoin Core and took a payment, but it's still syncing. What do I do?" There's even a Wiki page dedicated to telling befuddled newbies how to abandon the full node wallet for one offering less security and privacy. Running Armory has become a non-starter for many. Even those just trying to experiment with running a full node to learn about and support the network have been shocked at how long sync takes. And this is despite top-notch work in the last year to accelerate syncing while working within the constraints this system imposes.
We can try to wave these problems away with knowing references to Moore's Law, or we can face the reality that's in front of us. The cost-benefit tradeoff of running a full node is moving in the wrong direction - rapidly. Increasing the block size limit will almost certainly compound the problem. Satoshi could only speculate on the problems even modest uptake of Bitcoin would bring. We now have better information than he ever did.
We're going to have to be much smarter about scaling Bitcoin than simply upping the block size limit at the slightest hint of fee pressure.
A notable former Bitcoin developer once said that those rejecting a block size increase were afraid of Bitcoin succeeding. Maybe, just maybe, the real difference lies in the definition of "success."

The short answer is that coins don't move until the transaction is confirmed. Even then, reorganization can cause a confirmed transaction to pop out of the block chain. Thus the guideline for six confirmations.
A transaction that fails to confirm in ten or so minutes can hang around the memory pools of relaying nodes for a long time. Often, these nodes aren't miners. It's a very annoying situation that goes by the technical term "stuck transaction." :)
The process of clearing stuck transactions is very poorly defined and messy.
It's important to remember that there is no single "memory pool" any more than there is a single block chain. There are thousands of memory pools, each of which is controlled exclusively by the node operator.
By default, the memory pool doesn't expire transactions. They disappear when a node shuts down, but there is no built-in mechanism for sweeping transactions that have been unconfirmed for a long time.
A future update will likely included something called "mempool janitor" that will clean out old transactions:

Today, re-send them with a higher fee:
The tooling is primitive and difficult to use, but that can change given enough attention on the problem.
When wallets first started being released they either reused the same address (MultiBit Classic, a major privacy leak), or used a system that rendered backups invalid after 100 transactions.
HD wallets changed that. I suspect the next evolution of the wallet will recognize the inevitability of a fee market and finally give users the tools to compete effectively in it.

That's the connection to Bitcoin. Vanishing yields, negative real returns, and the potential for negative nominal consumer interest rates mean that old-fashioned paper currency starts to look attractive as a way to preserve wealth.
Bitcoin has some of the same security issues as paper cash, but with one major difference. You'll need something the size of a briefcase to store paper currency. And you'll need a place to store it. And then there are the legal issues with either: (1) withdrawing cash from a bank; or (2) spending large sums of cash.
With Bitcoin, you could "store the money" in your head with a mnemonic seed that you memorize - if you wanted to. No physical trace whatsoever, except the unencrypted paper backup you store in a secure location. And nobody can prevent you from spending or receiving payment.
We're a long way from large numbers of non-technical people turning to Bitcoin as a store of wealth. But every year the motivation to get over the learning curve increases.

It's also my understanding that the moderation policy was put in place to keep the scammers at bay. I don't agree, but it is what it is - and I haven't had to clean the toilets on One of the defining characteristics of an altcoin scam is the ease with which altcoins can be conjured into being. This low barrier leaves only one problem: building a community and a sense of legitimacy. That's where high-profile sites such as come in, doing clear damage in the process.
Where this all gets tricky is that it's actually very easy to set up a hard fork. Just clone the Core repo and go to town.
Just yesterday a brand new one of these popped up: Bitcoin Classic. Those in charge of it are trying their best to do many of the things a newly-launched altcoin does: appeal to a ready-made audience of Bitcoin users.
In fact, I've lost track now of the exact number and identities of these new hard-fork Bitcoin alternatives. It used to be just XT, but the landscape seems to be shifting very quickly.
It's not hard to imagine scams starting to emerge from this environment, some innocent mistakes, but other more malevolent.
So I suppose this would be a counterargument for keeping the current policy.

wallet.dat files are encoded in BerkeleyDB format. You can use a tool such as Pywallet to read it and from there, recover your relevant private keys.
The important lesson here is to *always* store an unencrypted copy of a key pool somewhere safe. Memories fade, and an encrypted wallet can lock you out just as effectively as a brain wallet.

The Bitcoin protocol requires nodes to know nothing about the outside world.
That's where oracles come in. An oracle decides how to sign a transaction (or whether to sign) based on outside events. Oracles can also provide cryptographic fragments needed to sign a transaction, rather than actually signing.
In the case of a will, the oracle could monitor a government death certificate database, for example. An heir would present a transaction to sign, and the oracle would refuse until it found the right death certificate on file. There are other ways to get this to work.

You see a problem that will lead to imminent disaster. Fine. But not everyone sees this in such black and white terms. You're asking highly competent software developers to lock themselves into a course of action that may start to look very shortsighted as it unfolds.

This seems to be the crux of the matter. Raising the block size limit is one way to do that, but Bitcoin's design makes it very difficult to see how this would work in practice. An alternative design seems much more likely to yield the outcome many want to  see.
All parties in this discussion appear to have made up their minds. The time for discussion is over. Now is the time for action.
There are many problems facing those who want to walk the Big Blocks path though. Not the least of which is where to set the new limit and how quickly. The risk of endless bikeshedding on exactly how to raise the limit, combined with the very peculiar nature of a hard fork update compared to a soft fork, and security "unknown unknowns" that can pop up at very inconvenient moments, makes that path especially risky.
Nevertheless, it's an experiment that should be tried. Just do it already.

@_date: 2016-01-13 15:48:16


The post that raised concern of the block size limit to a fever pitch was this one:
It paints a picture in which:
- there are "huge" confirmation times
- nodes' mempools would fill up and cause system crashes, compromising network security
- double spending unconfirmed transactions will become easier
- users will complain about unconfirmed transactions being stuck
- fee-bumping transactions would further overload the memory pool, creating a "race to the top" in fees
- SPV wallet users would have no way to gauge what fee to pay
- all of this would generate negative press, discouraging new users and encouraging mass exodus
- the exchange rate would collapse due to outflows
- fees would fall again to an equilibrium level
- "Bitcoin would survive," but with loss of "momentum"
Keep these predictions in mind as 2016 progresses. This was the year in which it was claimed in no uncertain terms that the block size limit *must* be raised or terrible consequences will result.
We've already had a taste in the second half of 2015 of what happens as blocks approach max capacity for extended periods of time.
So there's a falsifiable claim on the table, and it looks very likely to be put to the test within the next 12 months. Judge for yourself whether last year's tsunami of vitriol and ad hominem attacks was justified by the facts.

Agree, very awkward in its current form. However, that doesn't even to begin to approach the awkwardness of an incomplete hard fork, or the legal awkwardness of an organization that assumes stewardship over a rolling hard fork schedule.
Avoiding address re-use was at one time very awkward, too. HD wallets solved that problem, although awkwardness remains. Wallet makers are in the best position to offer fee market solutions as well.
Segwit and 2 MB blocks may postpone the need to come to terms with the fee market, but can't eliminate it. Wallet makers have very little influence over a hard or soft fork, but complete control over the feature sets of their own software.

The fee "reduction" was confusing and poorly communicated.
There are actually two fees:
1. The fee that nodes will look for (but not collect) when relaying your transaction.
2. The fee that a miner will look for (and possibly collect) when mining your block.
The fee that was reduced was (1). Fee (2), which is the fee most users actually deal with, didn't change.
For more on (1), see:
although this source seems to be out of date. (sidenote: can anyone point me to the part of the Bitcoin Core source code that defines this behavior)?
For more on (2), see:
Note that some transactions can qualify for a fee waiver:
If you plan it right (for example, with a coin control wallet like the latest Bitcoin Core), you can arrange for zero fee transactions, but all payment amounts (including change) must be greater than 10 mBTC.
You can set any fee you want, but if below the minimum required by (1) or (2), you may have to wait many hours for confirmation.

This isn't a Satoshi-specific problem. Anyone whose public key has been linked to another pseudonym (a legal name, an IP address, an email address, a Twitter handle, etc.) faces a similar situation. Many users don't even know they're in trouble privacy-wise - and act accordingly.
Privacy in Bitcoin is very difficult to pull off consistently. One privacy leak is all it takes to link you personally, rightly or wrongly, to a financial transaction. You can even be exposed by merely transacting with those who have bad privacy practices. The block chain is a public, permanent record, and you can do amazing things with it through graph analysis.
For example, consider the plight of the person who accepted Satoshi's payment (e.g., Tesla dealer). It could be reasonably concluded that this person either knew Satoshi's identity, or could find out (by tracing the car's VIN, for example). That's valuable information that would drive certain folks to do bad things to the person who held it.
Satoshi doesn't really have any good options. Your question assumes that he must use a public key that clearly belongs to him. There could be some wriggle room there. For example, the genesis block public key clearly belongs to Satoshi. Forensics suggest that most of the early blocks do as well, but as the block index increases, that certainty starts to break down.
My advice would be to pick a  key pair firmly in the grey area. In other works, pick one that an outside observer or may not be able to link to Satoshi - probably in one of the blocks in late 2010.
If that's not possible, and Satoshi only has private keys for the very first block rewards that were mined, he's in trouble. Any movement of coins would set of alarm bells. If Satoshi were concerned about what moving these coins could do to his privacy and personal security (and there's every reason to think he should be *very* afraid of that), then he's stuck.

As points out, block generation is a Poisson Process. You can calculate the probability of seeing a certain number of blocks in a given amount of time with the equation:
p = (λ^k e^-λ) /k!
where λ is the average number of blocks in the time interval you're interested in and k is the number of blocks you're testing.
The image you posted suggests that five blocks were generated in 20 minutes. In this case λ=2 (in 20 minutes there should be on average 2 blocks solved) and k = 5.
Using the calculator in the link below gives 3.6%  (x=5, average rate of success = 2). In other words, we expect to see ~4 in 100 20-minute periods yield 5 blocks exactly.
Also, keep in mind that the network loosely polices timestamps. A timestamp earlier than the median of the previous 11 blocks or later than two hours from network time is rejected. Network time is the median of timestamps returned by peers.
In other words, the timestamp on a block can vary by roughly by two hours on the plus side, and roughly 1 hour on the minus side.

Starting from the flawed assumption that Bitcoin Core contributors somehow control Bitcoin, this article agues for regime change:


Conveniently swept under the rug are three key points:
1. Bitcoin's open source code can be changed by anyone (including Coinbase) and deployed in any configuration at will.
2. Two high-profile attempts to accomplish Point (1) on a large scale (XT and Classic) have so far failed in their stated missions to bring about a hard fork.
3. A hard fork update isn't like any other kind of software update people are used to. Bitcoin's rules are being broken with a hard fork, something the system was designed to punish severely. The current protocol has an enormous advantage, both technically and politically - regardless of what changes are proposed.
Contributors to Bitcoin Core can't compel anyone to run software they don't want to run. If the groundswell of support the author imagines truly existed, and if a hard fork were really as simple to pull off as the author misleadingly implies, then the change would have already been complete.
The fact that the protocol hasn't changed despite the best efforts of many people with large social media megaphones should give the author reason to reconsider basic assumptions about how/why Bitcoin works.

The way I've seen this set up is to use two machines:
1. An offline Armory installation that signs transactions
2. An online, watch only, Armory installation that creates unsigned transactions, and broadcasts signed transactions.
MultiBit doesn't support this kind of cold storage in any form accessible to most users.
If you go with Armory, what are the specs of the online computer (2 above)? Be aware that to create an unsigned transaction you'll need to be running Bitcoin-Qt (or d) and the blockchain must be synced. That requires a relatively beefy machine.
Similar setup is possible with Electrum, with the advantage of faster syncing, no Bitcoin-Qt requirement, and no full blockchain.

The idea that contributors to Bitcoin Core somehow "control" Bitcoin lies at the root of numerous conspiracy theories. But consider these points:
1. Bitcoin Core is open source software. You can modify and deploy it at will.
2. Nobody can force you to run Bitcoin software you don't want to run.
3. Bitcoin severely punishes rule breaking, and increasing the block size breaks the rules. The old protocol has an enormous political and technical advantage, no matter what the proposed change does.
4. People with sizable social media followings have been trying for over a year to effect a hard fork update. Both of the biggest attempts (XT and Classic) have failed to do so despite claims of a groundswell of user support.
The conspiracy theory says that a cabal of well-funded developers have hijacked Bitcoin from Satoshi's original vision. It plays well in certain circles, but is poorly supported by the facts.

A node can apply a timestamp, but this doesn't say anything about when the tx was sent. Imagine node A and B. You're a double spender who sends two sibling transactions to each of A and B simultaneously. Which tx should be kept?
One solution would be to connect A and B to the same high-precision time server (maybe the one run by NIST, for example). But then that concentrates all of the systemic risk into that one server. A temporary outage brings the entire system down. Even worse can happen if the server becomes corrupted.
So, a permissioned ledger is one way to spread the systemic risk over a wider area.
It will be interesting to see how this plays out. There are multiple solutions to the distributed consensus problem, and a permissioned ledger is just one.

Alternatively, Bitcoin users will get used to the idea that they'll need to pay more for speed/certainty of confirmation. And wallet developers will help them do it by stepping up from unrealistic, hardcoded fees.
Effectively, the community has already split, with the XT/Classic developers leading the charge. But even *that* hard fork is a long way off. The grinding, uphill battle that seems to defy logic is part of Bitcoin's design. Hard forks were meant to be as difficult as possible. After all, the rules are being broken.
And those in favor of a hard fork have yet to make a compelling case that the hard fork must happen or else, IMO. As evidence I'd cite Mike Hearn's article:
For example, he inexplicably assumes that mempool policies will remain unchanged (and are difficult to change), putting the entire network in jeopardy of a catastrophic failure. This overwrought, one-sided analysis does little to further rational discussion.

Spending from a paper wallet securely and privately is the hard part. It's so hard to do correctly, that I'd recommend not using a paper wallet if you're serious about either security or privacy.
Instead, use a software wallet such as Electrum that will let you do proper cold storage.
But as a way to gain experience for how Bitcoin works, paper wallets can be very useful.

A similar story has been repeated with remarkable consistency over and over: after the initial PR buzz of accepting Bitcoin, a brick-and-mortar business' support often fades away without a trace.
At the same time, Bitcoin has demonstrated an extremely compelling use for certain groups of people: nullifying financial regulation and government manipulation.
Not enabling in-person purchases. Not replacing credit cards for online purchases. Not serving "the other six billion."
Instead, Bitcoin's true calling appears to be allowing people to route around the roadblocks their governments erect around the use of money.

The main problem is that it conjures the wrong mental picture and starts the discussion on the wrong footing.
I would instead start with the idea of cash - paper bank notes and metal coins. Then introduce the idea of its electronic counterpart - electronic cash. That naturally leads to double spending and the point of the Bitcoin network.

Starting with the ledger idea makes it seem as if transactions are similar to credit card payments or bank deposits and withdrawals. They aren't, but thinking they are lies at the root of most beginner confusion. This in turn can lead to loss of money. For example:

I'm not sure that's the defining feature of a digital coin.
I'll admit the terminology is a bit murky, but you can transfer ownership of a coin (unspent output), then reclaim a coin on the same chain of ownership as the original. This idea has huge privacy implications that the ledger model doesn't even surface.


You can, however, differentiate between two coins (unspent outputs). That's the whole idea behind Colored Coins, for example. And it's another example of how thinking in terms of a ledger limits what seems possible with Bitcoin.

The work itself isn't stored on the block chain. Instead, a unique identifier is stored. Your analogy of adding the car registration number is close. The difference is that there is no registrar.
You can get a unique identifier for any digital document through a hash function. A hash function is takes a blob of data as input and produces a number (hash value) within a very large range as output. SHA-256 is an example of a hash function used extensively in Bitcoin.
To make sense of the entry on the block chain, you need a way to see the original document that produced the hash value. Given the document, you can independently get its hash value and verify it exists on the block chain.

It's a possible attack that exists regardless of how large the block size limit is made. The behavior also plays a role in the Mike's article.
Retaining the current behavior of unconfirmed transactions does appear to be inconsistent with either of the two approaches currently on the table for preventing a mempool attack.
The problem with relying on mempool behavior is that, unlike selecting the active chain, there is no way to encourage nodes to follow any particular set of relay rules. A node can censor any transactions it chooses to censor, without getting forked off the network.
Complicated issues, for sure.

As I understand it, if the NDEBUG flag is set during compilation of a C++ project, then a failing assert() macro will not cause the executable to halt.








However, Bitcoin Core (and Unlimited) require NDEBUG to be unset, which causes the crash behavior should an assert be encountered:

    # error "Bitcoin cannot be compiled without assertions."
    
What I don't understand (and what the article doesn't explain except superficially in passing) is what advantage forcing NDEBUG to be unset gives. If anything, Bitcoin Core's current behavior looks like a vulnerability. And it seems quite plausible that there could be more assert()-gotchas hiding in both BU and Core.

Whatever you do, consider storing an unencrypted paper backup in a secure location. This turns your digital security problem into a physical security problem, something most people have direct experience with and are better at.
Unencrypted: judging from the comments I've seen here over the last few years, you're far more likely to forget the password to your only encrypted backup than to have your unencrypted backup discovered by an attacker. 
Paper: Digital media can fail at the most inconvenient times - and you won't know you have a problem until you do. Paper isn't indestructible, but it's far more durable in comparison.
In addition to an unencrypted paper backup, you might consider memorizing your seed. For example:

No. Here's a better way:
1. Obtain bitcoin from a source who implements good privacy practices. This excludes Coinbase, Circle, and any other AML/KYC source.
2. Pay for bitcoin with cash.
3. Do not re-use addresses. Ever.
4. Do not post a Bitcoin address you're using/have used or TXID to any social media outlet. Ever.
5. Make a purchase.
The problem with mixers is all the trust you're placing in them to keep the link between chains of ownership private. That trust can be violated in any number of ways, even by services you consider trustworthy.
An investigator who can track your coins from an AML/KYC exchange to a mixer can coerce the operator into revealing the path through the mixer. Once that path is obtained, the investigator will have evidence that you personally were involved in a purchase.

Yes. Bitcoin is an "electronic cash system." That's how electronic cash systems work - through reassignment of token ownership.  These systems had a long history before Bitcoin.

See:
Also, technically the wallet doesn't necessarily get emptied. Instead, spent outputs become unspendable in the future. In other words, only a subset of the tokens locked to an address can be spent. See:

Confirmation takes place when a transaction is added to the block chain for the first time. It also happens when blocks are added to the block containing the transaction.
That's what happens on a schedule of roughly once every ten minutes.


Not exactly. The transaction propagates to the merchant, relayed by nodes. More importantly, coins themselves are not sent.
What is sent is a transaction. Think of a transaction as a specially-formatted message that transfers the ownership of one or more coins.
Putting all of this together, the merchant receives a signed message that says that you transfer your coin to the merchant. This message is relayed by the nodes on the network using a system similar to the Telephone game. After about 10 minutes, one of the nodes adds the transaction to the block chain, producing the first confirmation.

There's an element of asymmetry to consider that I'm not sure is captured well in this post.
Imagine a hard fork. Let's call the new protocol Neocoin and the old protocol Bitcoin. Here are two scenarios that may seem symmetrical, but actually aren't:
1. **Neocoin gains a hash rate majority.** Each kind of node (Bitcoin and Neocoin) disregards the other's chain as invalid. Neocoin nodes disregard the Bitcoin chain because it is shorter (in the proof-of-work sense). Bitcoin nodes disregard the Neocoin chain because it breaks the protocol.
2. **Bitcoin retains a hash rate majority.** Both Neocoin and Bitcoin nodes see the same active chain. Neocoin nodes reject any attempt to keep building the Neocoin chain due to the Bitcoin chain having more proof-of-work.
It gets trickiest near a 50-50 split in hash rate. Here the majority can swing back and forth over time intervals ranging from hours to days or even months.
A switchover from (1) to (2) would cause a multi-block reorganization for Neocoin nodes as they abandon the Neocoin chain in favor of the longer (proof-of-work) Bitcoin chain. That could rewrite a major chunk of the transaction history for Neocoin users - a very unpleasant possibility. Bitcoin users would be unaffected by such a swing because they will always reject the Neocoin chain - no matter how long it gets.
A switchover from (2) to (1) would likewise cause a multi-block reorganization for Neocoin nodes, but not Bitcoin nodes.
In other words, only Neocoin nodes can swing back-and-forth, reorganizing the transaction history - possibly over many cycles. Bitcoin always rejects the Neocoin chain, regardless of how long it gets and sees no such reorganization.
Returning to the questions the article leads with:


Does this consideration of asymmetry change the answers at all?

A few responses:
1. The Core team *has* made a decision and that decision is to leave the block size limit where it is. That may not be a popular stance among some circles, but it is a decision.
2. Zero-confirmation transactions are inherently insecure. You won't find any mention of them in the white paper, and for good reason. They're outside the scope of the invention.
3. Users do have an incentive to run full nodes: privacy and security. That said, I have yet to see a workable scheme for monetary incentives that could be applied to Bitcoin without major disruption.

It's easy to think that this is nothing more than "changing a parameter." But Bitcoin is a fantastically complicated system built from simple parts.

1. want to sell a few hundred bitcoin (lets say 300 BTC)
2. want the proceeds in local currency
3. live in a country known for its harsh policies toward people who "hide money"
I'll give you the benefit of the doubt that these things are true, and you don't plan to scam anyone. However, your comment about having "a bit over 1,000" does smell fishy to me. It's not relevant to what you're trying to do, and is exactly the kind of thing a confidence man would say.
Nevertheless, your main task is to weigh the tradeoffs of a private trade (cash for bitcoin) vs. a completely transparent trade (registered exchange to your bank account).
It's impossible to say which is better given the information you've revealed. One thing to consider is privacy. The more your counterparty knows about you, the more they (or their associates) can do to you in the future - possibly without your knowledge. Another thing to consider is security. How exactly do you imagine a 300 BTC trade for cash going down? Be specific.
A third option, which you did not for some reason mention, is to use your bitcoin to make your purchase(s) directly. This, IMO, is the best option generally speaking. So unless you have a really good reason for buying local currency first, this is the option I'd spend the most time researching.

Both have many of the same properties:
- fixed face value
- value can be combined and split
- security features to defeat counterfeiting
- once given they can only be taken back if handed over or stolen
- both can be lost or stolen
- they can both be traded without involving a third party
The main difference is that physical coins are made of atoms, and digital coins are made of bits. The latter can be sent over great distances and stored using almost no physical space.

It's a time stamp set by the server's system clock. This method fails on a distributed network because there's no way to ensure that every clock is synchronized or properly configured.
Even if you can resolve the problem through a central time server (one run by a government, for example), you still have the problem of network latency. One node will perceive a different time of arrival than another, and these differences will vary.
Either way, you need a way for every node to arrive at exactly the same ordering of transactions. That's where the "timestamp server" idea in the white paper comes in.

By many accounts, Bitcoin works remarkably, amazingly well. It's been written off for dead more times than I can remember. It's suffered horrific exchange rate crashes - repeatedly. It suffered a persistent chain split. Its main exchange blew up in a very public, embarrassing way. It remains a favorite whipping boy for "professional economists."
Here's the thing: Bitcoin needs to keep working in the future. There's a lot of money riding on the outcome now. Many of the things people want Bitcoin to do are mutually-exclusive.
If it's quick fixes and hair-trigger responses you're after, you've probably joined the wrong tribe.

There should really be a resource written for new users who download Bitcoin Core and use it immediately to accept a payment. Your question comes up a lot, and that's not good.
That said, you really should not be using Bitcoin Core as a beginner. It will take many hours, and possibly a day or more of continuous connection before it will be ready for use. Every time you run it, the same thing will happen: you'll wait, and the length of the wait will depend on how much time passes between uses.
You have two options:
1. Keep Core connected until it finishes
2. Use a different wallet.
As suggests, Electrum is a good wallet for beginners. But to use it you'll need your "private keys" from Bitcoin Core.
To get them:
1. Help-&gt;Debug window to open the debug window.
2. Click the "Console" tab.
3. type "dumpprivkey &lt;address&gt;", replacing "&lt;address&gt;" with the address you used to accept your payment.
You should get a private key that can be swept (don't import it) into Electrum. Feel free to post follow ups if you get stuck.

This reminds me of Firesheep. Sometimes, the only way you can convince people there is a problem is to show them.

From the link in the OP, the problem appears to be these lines in SendXThinBlock:
    if (inv.type == MSG_XTHINBLOCK)
    {
        // some stuff
    }
    else if (inv.type == MSG_THINBLOCK)
    {
        // some other stuff
    }
    else
      {
           assert(0);  // inv type is not correct 
      }
If a peer sends an unrecognized inventory message (which any node can do very easily), the final else block is executed.
The final else block uses assert, which has been described this way:


That last part, *terminating the program execution*, looks somewhat alarming.
So on face value, executing the last else branch will shut down the BU instance.
However, the description also contains this:




AFAICT, whether or not a BU instance shuts down in response to receiving an unrecognized inventory message depends on whether the NDEBUG flag was set at compile time. If it was, the assert macro would be disabled and BU nodes will not crash (at least from the use of assert).
So the (potential) problem doesn't appear to be with the code itself, but rather with the possibility that the NDEBUG flag was left unset during compilation of the release.
Is this correct? If not, what am I missing?

One of the differences between Bitcoin and Ethereum is the governance model, with Vitalik keeping a much tighter grip on the reins. That might sound good at first, but it does give attackers (governments and extortionists) something specific to attack and/or currupt.

It's not widely known, but you can deposit money into other people's bank accounts through a method called "cash deposit." That method can be used to fund bitcoin purchases with cash at a bank teller.
Here's one way to do it with Localbitcoins (counterintuitively, no meetup with the seller is needed):
The same cash deposit method is used by BitQuick:
I've used cash deposit with both services to buy as little as $5 worth of bitcoin.

Although I've often disagreed with Mike's more recent views that increasing the block size limit is the only way forward, he's been an invaluable help to me in trying to understand Bitcoin. If you're reading, thanks Mike for the lucid posts and presentations.
If you haven't seen it yet, have a look as this early, visionary talk in which Mike lays out many of the programmable money ideas that people are working on today, both in Bitcoin and elsewhere:
That said, I'm not sure the article's thesis makes sense. Mike seems to be saying that the Bitcoin experiment failed because the change he was advocating (raising the block size limit) was rejected by the Core team, and by miners. He goes on to imply that Bitcoin is controlled by an oligopoly centered around the Core team.
The article conspicuously glosses over the non-intuitive difference between hard and soft forks. The fact that neither XT nor any hard-forked alternative has been able to gain credible momentum should speak to the difficulty of creating hard forks, DoS attacks notwithstanding. And knowing that certain rules will be nearly impossible to change is a feature for many.
Second, Mike has repeatedly suggested that Bitcoin should be led by an oligopoly of one. So it's ironic to be claiming failure for Bitcoin on the grounds of oligopoly when Mike's stated goal seems to be something even less inclusive.
The discussion of censorship on Bitcointalk and this is a red herring. Every forum will maintain its own editorial policies. Nothing stops any Bitcoin user from availing themselves of alternative news outlets and forums, just as nothing prevents them from running a custom node with a new block size limit or installing a distribution that does the same thing.
Maybe - just maybe, the block size limit isn't increasing for reasons that might not mesh well with Mike's thesis.

The kickoff to the block size discussion was an urgent call that Bitcoin was in imminent danger of crashing and burning if the limit were not raised - within the year.
Either the problem is urgent and must now be dealt with, or it isn't and we can wait until both the problem (if it exists) and the solution are clearer. But both can't be true simultaneously.
I agree that discussion is important. But now is the time for those trying to convince others of the immediacy of the problem to prove it by committing to an alternative that will demonstrate how disasterous not acting immediately really was.
I'm neutral on what the outcome will be, but it's now time to test falsifiable claims.

It's very flimsy, and that's one reason for the discord.
The sky is not falling. After every other "stress test," the network resumed normal operation and the attacker lost a bunch of money. None of the predicted ill effects came about. That can always change; maybe this time will be different.

Your post points to three use cases as "the front bowling pins" - in other words, most compelling, high-priority uses for Bitcoin:






The idea that Bitcoin can/will displace credit cards as a payment system is a strong undercurrent of most, if not all, big-blocks-now arguments. In fact, I'd say it's a litmus test for where you come down on the issue of a hard fork now.
If you believe Bitcoin can/will displace credit cards, then you see the &lt; 7 TPS transaction limit as a roadblock, and something that must be fixed - sooner rather than later.
If, on the other hand, you've seen the failed experiments in which a merchant announces they're taking Bitcoin, only to find out they stopped 6-10 months later, then this kind of talk rings hollow and more than a little simplistic. For example:
So using the "Bitcoin will replace credit cards" argument probably won't bring the community together in the way you think.
Bitcoin as a cross-border remittance system is a bit better. Here, at least, you'll find agreement by all sides. But if you're talking about remittances to the poor "other six billion," you're going to get a lot less agreement. Listen to this guy's story, then let's re-examine the idea:
Still, using Bitcoin to move money across borders is a "killer app." And works today extremely well. Furthermore, it will continue working well into the future, regardless of the block size limit.
You failed to mention another use case: censorship-resistant financial transactions. In other words, money without government, and money outside the control of government.
When you see this as "the front bowling pin," things start to look different. If this is the most compelling thing you can hire Bitcoin for, scaling bitcoin discussions take a back seat to issues of fungibility, censorship-resistance, privacy, and centralization. Indeed, the "one-time initialization time of starting up a new node" starts to look like a big deal, as does the ongoing, increasing cost of maintaining a full node.
Discussions around the block size limit have revealed deep disagreement about what Bitcoin is for. In many ways, these visions are mutually exclusive.
So I think it's inaccurate to claim the Core team isn't listening to customers. Just because one group of customers doesn't share your vision doesn't mean they don't count.

There's a tendency to view Bitcoin as a system allowing top-down control with "Core developers" at the top. This misconception really gained traction during the last 10 months. People who should have known better made this argument in support of a hard fork. The "Core developers," they claimed, were blocking progress by refusing to implement desperately needed changes.
Here are two points to consider:
1. There is no "Core team." There is simply a group of self-selected individuals who decide to contribute code to a common repository.
2. The opinions of the various members of the "Core team" don't matter nearly as much as Bitcoin's consensus rules.
In other words, the working hypothesis behind the Big Blocks camp, namely that "Core developers" are holding Bitcoin back, may be flawed to say the least.
Here's a new working hypothesis. The block size limit hasn't yet increased because Bitcoin's consensus rules and the economics that derive from them don't yet support an increase. If/when that should change, a hard fork can clearly succeed, will be introduced, and may overtake the original in use and hash power.
If this seems counterintuitive, re-read point (1).

You might start by practicing moving *small* amounts of bitcoin into and back out of cold storage. That last part is overlooked by many, but is a critical component.
The problem with paper wallets is that no good, truly offline method exists to spend funds from them. The best option is to sweep with Mycelium, but there are still risks with that.
Here's more:
After looking at this problem from many angles, the best solution I've found is to use Electrum coupled with a secure signing environment based on Tails booted from a live CD.
This addresses the problem with change address and offline signing. The only additional equipment is a writable CD and a USB drive. I'm working on a writeup of the procedure.
@_date: 2014-11-03 19:13:07
No, I don't see any special risks there. Electrum is a deterministic wallet. Like others, its designed to give users the tools to avoid address re-use.

The signature algorithm works very roughly as follows:
1. transaction is hashed
2. hash value and private key are used to create two values (r, s), representing the signature.
3. recipient uses (r, s) to generate a verification point on the elliptic curve. If the x-coordinate of this point matches the public key's x-coordinate, then the signature is valid.
The part about hashing the transaction is tricky. There are six different modes, which are determined by the "signature hash type." There's a good discussion of that here:

That's not really how it works. Want to create a hard fork? Just do it. You don't need anybody's permission.
Let's say you only have 1% of the network hash rate. You release a hard fork update and point your rigs at it. You limp along generating blocks every 1,000 minutes. Stick at it long enough and difficulty will come down to a point where you're back at 10 minute blocks. You might decide to write a one-time reduction in difficult to grease the skids. You might even be able to attract a miner/user following for your alt coin by, for example, by adding new features, fixing bugs, relentless promotion, celebrity endorsements, or some combination.
However, your experiment would be in constant danger of sudden annihilation by a hostile miner. A pool with 10% of the Bitcoin network hash power could begin at your branch point and simply undo every transaction your network has confirmed. See, for example:
Such an attack would cost you real money, because you could have been directing that mining power at the Bitcoin network, earning block subsidies. Instead, you now have nothing.
In other words, don't think of a hard fork as a clean switchover to a new network. Think of it as a messy political-technical process that may or may not go according to plan. And the original network has an enormous home-field advantage. So there's every chance the new alt coin will co-exist with Bitcoin - perhaps indefinitely. During that time miners and users may have the ability to switch, resulting in wild exchange rate fluctuations, and other bizarre behavior.
You and others who see Bitcoin as a store of value could either trade into the confusion, or stand pat waiting for the dust to settle. If you don't want to move your coins to the new network, there's no way to force you - although the weaker fork will always be risky to stay on.
You can't stop altcoins and you can't stop hard forks. What you can do is approach every discussion of a deliberate hard fork with a clear idea of the risks involved. It's not simple.


Satoshi was very clear from the beginning that this experiment only works if the majority of the hash power follows the rules. Buying bitcoin means being ok with that idea.

When prevailing transaction fees are too high to support your most valuable use case, then the block size limit is too low.
Unfortunately, this means that everyone will have a slightly different take on what the block size limit should be.
Regardless, Bitcoin needs to work within the constraint that every transaction ever confirmed will be validated by every full node stored till the end of time - somewhere. Changing the block size limit doesn't change this fundamental requirement.

What's interesting about this story is that you'll find similar stories when the exchange rate was $3 and $30.
Bitcoin's detractors often point to the profits made by those who "got in early" as proof-of-pyramid. Early adopters keep getting richer and richer at the expense of everyone else who gets in too late. That's exactly how pyramids work. QED.
But as this post makes perfectly clear, every investor has a selling price. The number of people willing to keep 100% of their net worth through the gyrations Bitcoin is capable of undergoing is extremely small. Most of the rest will sell low and possibly buy back high as their profits slowly but surely melt away.

Marketplace disruptors don't work by "destroying" the incumbent. They work by starting off as objectively worse than the incumbent in one or more important ways. Then the disruptor changes the rules under which the incumbent must operate.
Although the disruptor starts out being much worse, it improves at a much faster rate than the incumbent. Eventually the incumbent can't compete and becomes irrelevant.
Bitcoin is worse than most other forms of money for most of the world. It has a tiny network (of people using it). Payments are final, even in cases of theft. It has a fixed supply that can't grow and contract with demand. It requires users to be very adept at technology and especially digital security. Transactions are confirmed on an indeterminate schedule. Transaction fees are based on byte count rather than value. And so on.
But every one of those drawbacks is exactly what some small group of users wants desperately. With regular use, the technology improves. Those wanting instant payments finally get it and now an entirely new market opens up. Those wanting consumer protection  get it, opening up still bigger areas. And so on.
The process can take decades before the challenger begins to effect the marketplace. But once it does, the former incumbent faces a very challenging market where it no longer sets the rules.

One of the most powerful is to practice good privacy hygiene. Don't reuse addresses. Don't publish addresses. Avoid counterparties using poor privacy practices. Don't tell others how much Bitcoin you own, when you buy, or who you trade with.

This future-tense posturing is the sign of a weak hand. If/when the hard fork fails, Antpool and others of its ilk will be the first to jump ship back to 1MB blocks.
If this sounds impossible, consider:


For one thing, the number of miners supporting a hard fork is irrelevant. Second, full nodes decide whether a hard fork will be adopted - as do other players such as exchanges.
A hard fork at this point remains a risky proposition, something certain supporters have consistently swept under the rug in their efforts to engineer the impression of "broad support" for their ill-conceived proposals.

Censorship-resistance depends on several factors, none of which are a slam dunk at this point:
- decentralization of mining resources
- decentralization of node ownership
- transaction privacy
The first two points have factored prominently in the block size limit discussion. Odd as it may seem, it *is* possible to be against censorship and *for* the existing block size limit.
One user's spam is another's treasure. Finding a way to navigate this paradox in an open system in which *every* transaction must be kept *forever* is where honest people can disagree.

I'm not referring to the March 2013 chain split. That was an issue with the underlying database mechanism, as you point out.
I'm talking about the 0.8.1 release which came after it. That release implemented both a soft fork (reduce the number of unique txids that could be referenced) and a soft fork (raise the number of unique txids that could be referenced a few months after the decrease) - all in one package.
When I say "hard fork," I'm talking about an update to the software, not a chain split (which can be caused by an update). The terminology around this is quite bad. Nevertheless, in a year or two of asking about this, 0.8.1 is the one and only instance of a hard fork update I've been able to find.

Your fee density is 15 satoshis/byte:
Which is too low for next-block confirmation under current conditions:
It's fee density, not absolute fee, that determines the speed of confirmation.
As a rule of thumb, an Alice-pays-Bob transaction with change will require about 226 bytes. Under prevailing conditions, the fee should therefore be ~16,000 satoshis.
Your transaction is much larger than that due to 17 inputs, each of which add ~150 bytes.

Very polished and professional looking.
The people who will likely watch this video already use credit cards and online banking. They use centralized money transfer apps like Venmo and Paypal. In places like Kenya, they're already using M-Pesa. And it all works just fine.
They don't need what this ad is selling.
Bitcoin's unique selling proposition is to break free of government financial manipulation. This appeals to a very small fraction of people. Political dissidents. Tax and capital controls evaders. Privacy advocates. Inflation hedgers. Black marketeers.
These uses don't exactly make for a feel-good commercial because they remind us of the poor state of much of the world. These uses also don't attract a mass audience.
The one thing that can change this would be if Bitcoin were to broadly enable e-commerce in ways that are impossible with currently money systems. That's a long shot because eBay, Amazon, and others are currently good enough for the vast majority of people. Even then, these new modes of e-commerce will be small to begin with and look very strange, keeping most people away.
Open Bazaar and similar efforts represent the best shot at creating mass appeal for Bitcoin. Still, the audience is going to be quite small for some time. Simple things like enabling people to cheaply secure their funds (real security) without a background in computers will need to come first. Wallets that can automatically choose the best fee for prevailing network conditions. That sort of thing.

Your transaction doesn't take effect until it's "confirmed," or appears in the block chain. Two possible outcomes:
1. transaction confirmed - ownership of the money trades hands
2. transaction not confirmed and gradually deleted from the network - the money stays with its current owner
There is no way to know what will be the fate of your transaction. You can push the process by re-spending with a new transaction paying higher fees, but currently this is for advanced users only.

Let's take that idea at face value. If so, did Bitcoin go bankrupt in 2010 (or perhaps suffer a sudden hyperinflationary episode?) during the value overflow incident?
184 billion bitcoin were created in one fell swoop. The protocol (Satoshi's software) was obeyed flawlessly. The Bitcoin scripting system simply executed its code. This was only a failure from the standpoint of Bitcoin's investors. From a technical standpoint, Bitcoin worked seamlessly.
AFAICT, the main difference between these two situations is what the fork changed. In 2010, the Bitcoin fork changed a general rule, without targeting individual public keys.
The proposed fixes for the DAO situation all seem to involve blacklists as well. There be dragons.

As an individual user, I'd like to pay nothing in fees now and forever in the future.
As someone thinking of the many privacy, usability, and security problems that can result from "free" services, my thoughts are more nuanced.
To the extent that there is a "social contract" in Bitcoin, its one inalienable element is the halving of the block subsidy every four years. At least today.
So this is what every Bitcoin user "signed up for" - a system of money *temporarily* secured by an inflation subsidy paid to miners.
In 8 years, no deployable alternative to transaction fees has been proposed. Part of the problem is knowing how much mining is enough. You could argue that we already have too much mining given the relentless climb in difficulty. The other part is figuring out how to pay for the least amount of mining possible. This was the idea behind Assurance Contracts, which is the best-discussed alternative I know of:
But even this doesn't eliminate the need for someone to pay someone else some amount of money for securing the network.
Whatever the answer turns out to be, the clock is ticking.

My guess is based on the extremely primitive user interfaces and use cases for Bitcoin. Don't get me wrong, this stuff is incredible. But you really must understand the protocol at this stage in the game to avoid losing money and privacy. Post after post of people not understanding fees, how to secure private keys, what the risks of keeping money on exchanges are, or the risks of combining AML/KYC with a pseudonymous public chain of ownership.
Not to mention the general lack of consensus of what Bitcoin *is for*. Is it the innovation that will bring billions of people into a common economic platform? Is the end of central banks? Is it a way for the wealthy to keep money from capital controls? Is it the ultimate vehicle for speculation, but little else?
If you look at what people are actually using Bitcoin for currently, it spans a wide range. Little stands out as having been spectacularly compelling except black market payments and financial speculation.

New users seem to be showing up regularly, as evidenced by posts here and elsewhere.


That poor experience comes from wallets using hardcoded fees. I agree that it's a problem. Even with better wallets, it's far from intuitive how fees work the way they do or why.
Nevertheless, this will be true with 1 MB blocks, 2 MB blocks, or 8 MB blocks.


Maybe, but I was thinking more along the lines of focusing attention on long-term, decentralized scaling solutions that can be safely phased in while avoiding short term fixes that put the network in jeopardy of persistently forking and causing an even worse user experience.

Let me clarify.
I remember an interview with one of the founds of Google. He said that in the early days the Google team didn't want a lot of users flocking to the service.
He noted that the longer people waited to use Google, the better the experience would be, and the more likely they would be to return. He wasn't advocating a complete ban on new users, but rather stating a vision that could be used to decide what to work on or fund next.
Bitcoin has given us some pretty considerable constraints to work within. Many of these constraints boil down to the inherent tension between centralization and convenience. Centralized solutions to scaling problems, once adopted, tend to be very difficult to dislodge.
Navigating these constraints is where honest people can disagree. Nobody who has dedicates countless hours of their life to Bitcoin wants to "cripple" it, despite what people who should know better might say.

It's pretty clear that Boring isn't versed in what secures a block chain or their potential applications and wants instead to play the role of regulatory intermediary. This is clear within a few minutes of listening to her.
So it's pointless to ask her questions about technology.

When she stumbles, try to help her, but if she can't recover, just drop it.
Clearly, she's not steeped in the tech side - there's no need to unmask her. Why not instead focus on what she appears to be very good at - rubbing elbows.
From the recent WSJ article on the Fed "Blockchain" summit:


Ask her what it was like to help set that event up. Did she attend? What were some of the regulatory themes or questions that came up there and which might not have been well-reported? What was the context of Yellin's comments?

FWIW, I agree. The problem is way too technical for most people to bother with. There are lots of problems like that in Bitcoin - beyond slow confirmation.


Many, many hurdles to get over before that's even a remote possibility.


It's not up to them. The block size has not increased because users in aggregate don't think the benefits outweigh the risks. When that changes, the block size will increase.


That can happen for many, many other reasons. If history is any guide, it probably will.

Your first mistake: thinking it's *your* bitcoin when you actually gave it to VirWoX and they gave you a promise to pay it back.
It's a mistake made by Bitcoin users over and over again. Some can learn from the mistakes of others, but it seems some people won't learn even when hit over the head. It doesn't matter how well-funded, well-admired, or well-meaning the bank - when the shit hits the fan, you're going to get dirty.
Bitcoin solves that problem by turning to an old idea: money belongs to you. It's simple in concept, but not so simple in practice. Generate a free key pair. Lock a coin to that key pair. The coin is yours because nobody else controls it. When the time comes, re-lock the coin to the key pair belonging to your payee.

Overall, one of the better efforts, but it, like almost everything else ever done on this topic in the popular press, glosses over the extremely tough problem of hard fork updates.
To nontechnical users, this doesn't seem important. And to hear Mike Hearn tell it, it's no big deal at all.
Except a hard fork update has only happened once before, and that was in response to an existential crisis that was widely-regarded as such. And it was a very special case in other ways as well. The consequences of a hard fork update gone wrong could do far more damage than blocks that consistently come out at 1MB.
I can understand why the whole hard fork issue gets swept under the rug - it's very hard to understand and doesn't make intuitive sense.

For those wondering what this is:
checksequenceverify (CSV) is a group of 3 BIPs that will enable relative time locks. This will let you lock money for a predetermined period after your transaction confirms. The time can be a time measured in multiples of 512 seconds or a block count.
CSV is useful by itself, but it will probably get the most use in more complex contracts like payment channels (Lightning Network) , where it can enable something that might seem impossible: payments that can be revoked off-chain. This simplifies 2-way payment channels implemented with a single contract.
CSV allows some of the same capabilities of a defunct Bitcoin feature called "replacement," which was designed to allow the terms of a contract to be updated before confirmation. That feature was disabled very early on in Bitcoin's history due to various security issues. CSV brings it back in a way that can be enforced securely.

There's this idea out there that using LN requires users to "tie up" their money. On face value, this does appear to be the case. Funds in an open channel can't be used off-channel without closing the channel.
Now consider that one of the best ways to secure bitcoin is to split it into two pools: a highly secure savings pool and a spending pool. We don't think of money in savings or spending as being tied up. It's all money that can be moved around at will.
That's one way to think of LN. As a pool of money that can be used for instant purchases, metered services, and other specialized cases. Even with moderately broad adoption, LN could replace services like BitPay and Coinbase merchant.
In other words, you could think of funds in a LN channel as a spending pool. Use it for small daily purchases. Empty and fill this pool as needed.

Assuming that various companies can resist the urge to mke their own marks, maybe "Blockchain" has a future. If history is any guide (e.g., browser wars), there's little chance of this happening. Without some legal or technical edge, margins will evaporate very quickly.

Another way to look at it is that the original paper document was already untrustworthy. It's just that block chain timestamping brings the security flaws to light.
As I understand it, though, your conclusion is correct. You'll need to closely guard the exact version of that PDF.
In fact, PDF may not be the best form in which to keep the document. What if you want an HTML or plain text version, for example?
You could make a case that markdown would be the way to go. It's transparent because it's plain text. Yet it's flexible enough to produce HTML, PDF, and many other formats.
Using a revision control system like git/github means you can distribute not only the document but its revision history to as many secure servers as you want.
Regardless of the format, if you lose a copy of the original document, it's game over in terms of using the timestamp.

Interesting. When you say it automatically adjusts, do you mean the fee density (satoshis/byte) or the total fee (satoshis).
Electrum can adjust the fee itself because it knows the size of the transaction in bytes.
But adjusting the fee density requires looking at the fees paid in the last few blocks. It's possible because Electrum gets other data from the servers it connects to. I just haven't looked into it yet.

Your problem is collateralization. Nobody trusts you to pay the loan back. You need to put up something of value you'll lose if you renege. And there needs to be a way to guarantee that the collateral will be transferred to the lender if you default.
An out-there idea (that probably won't help you now) might involve colored coins and time-locked contracts. The colored coin represents an asset you care about (maybe an in-game token). You and the lender set up a system of transactions in which s/he gets the colored coin if you don't repay the loan in a predetermined time.

Yes. You'd need to be using P2SH addresses for this to work (starts w/ "3").
However, no matter what the sender knows about your script, s/he can't change the terms that you specified for spending the coins being sent. You tell the sender how to lock the payment, not the other way around. That's the crux of the matter.

@_date: 2016-06-21 16:51:09
It makes Bitcoin more useful as programmable money.
It's not widely-known but when you make a transaction, you're actually causing little programs ("scripts", "contracts") to run on every full node. The result of running the program determines if you (or your payer) gets the money. Even the simplest Alice-Pays-Bob transaction uses this system. But these programs can also be very complex and powerful.
Time is a very important feature in many financial arrangements (rent payments, interest payments, post-dated checks, etc.). Until recently, it wasn't easy to build time into contracts. CSV and another recent update (CLTV) add a range of new powerful features for doing that.
To the extent that this is something people with money care about (and there's every indication they do), that could increase demand for bitcoin in the long run.

It wasn't too long ago that single-address wallets were seen as acceptable. That's before many folks understood the profoundly bad consequences of address reuse on privacy.
Today, multi-key wallets have become the norm (e.g., HD-wallets). But it took several BIPs and a few years worth of implementation to get there.
I see parallels today with how wallets casually disregard the question of fees, and the reality of regular pileups like the one happening now.

From the paper's abstract:


several peer-to-peer (P2P) anonymous communication protocols
have been proposed. Despite their strong anonymity
guarantees none of those has been employed in practice so
far: Most fail to simultaneously handle the crucial problems
of slot collisions and malicious peers, while the remaining
ones handle those with a significant increased latency (communication
rounds) linear in the number of participating
peers in the best case, and quadratic in the worst case. In
this work, we conceptualize these P2P anonymous communication
protocols as P2P mixing, and present a novel P2P
mixing protocol, Fast-DC, that only requires constant (i.e.,
four) communication rounds in the best case, and 4 + 2f
rounds in the worst case of f malicious peers. As every
individual malicious peer can halt a protocol run by omitting
its messages, with its worst-case linear-round complexity, we
find Fast-DC to be an optimal P2P mixing solution.
Very interesting and useful stuff.

If you've never thought about money - where it comes from, why it has value, and the many often invisible ways in which it controls your life - Bitcoin isn't going to be interesting at all. Until many more people are using it, that is.
If you have thought about money, Bitcoin will be much more interesting.
Many people tried from the early 1990s into 2009 to create systems of money based on software rather than edict, and all failed.
The fundamental problem was digital scarcity. It's easy to devise a digital token that two parties agree has some value. A computer file or even a simple text message will do. The problem is how to prevent that token from being copied and spent more than once.
Bitcoin solves that problem and so represents a fundamental advance in both computer science and economics. In fact, it brings the two fields together in a completely new way.

I think the forces driving merchants can be numerous and subtle. I also think that the vast majority of merchants never actually handle Bitcoin, but outsource it to a payment processor like Coinbase or BitPay.

I agree with Peter about many things he says about privacy, but not this one. Here's the document in question:
BIP 75 is an *opt-in* extension to the Payment Protocol that allows payer and payee to encrypt and sign messages to establish identity and authenticate themselves.
It's nothing I'd be interested in off the top of my head, but maybe others might be. For one thing it establishes an encrypted channel between payer and payee. That in itself is broadly useful.
As for removing BIP 75 from the repo, Peter makes a very unconvincing argument. Regulatory compliance is only one use case. The encrypted messages dont contribute to block chain bloat. And the entire thing is op-in.
Chances are, your exchange already forces you to do the AML/KYC rumba. If you don't like that, leave them... In the same way you can opt out of BIP 75.
But to censor a proposal simply because it makes Compliance easier for some parties who choose to use it seems hypocritical.

Rick makes the same argument I've heard before. Namely, that Bitcoin's best hope at protecting itself is rapid mass adoption. That way, it can't be regulated out of existence or corrupted.
There are many problems with this idea, not the least of which is that nontechnical people find the responsibility of managing private keys absolutely horrifying, once they understand the great responsibility that comes with the great power.
That's why so many people continue to use exchanges as banks to hold "their" bitcoin, despite repeated warnings of the risk they're taking, and overwhelming evidence that this is a bad idea.
And with the centralization pressure this brings, it becomes all too easy to coerce these new bank-like institutions into censoring transactions, instituting black lists, bitlicens-style nonsense, and worse.
In many ways, premature mass adoption is the worst thing that could possibly happen to Bitcoin.
Far better to lay the groundwork for keeping the system decentralized, while it can still safely be ignored by regulators.

Yes, that's one way to use these features. But I think CLTV (aka OP_HODL, which has been deployed for a few months now) would be better because you can set a lock time further in the future than what CSV allows, IIRC.
CLTV is already available and you can *experiment* with it here:
Emphasis on "experiment" because once you lock and publish the transaction there's no undoing it. You're better off practicing with chump change before wielding this particular magic wand on real money.

Good summary of the basic issues around halving that gets things mostly right.
However, the article doesn't mention the relentless upward march of difficulty, which has effectively cut the mining reward by half twice yearly for years on end:
Putting all of that into an article of 1,000 words or less would be a challenge, though.


Two nits to pick:
- "bitcoin" is a mass noun, so it's preferred to say "50 bitcoin" rather than "50 bitcoins."
- "Bitcoin" is the overall system, "bitcoin" is the unit of currency. Capitalization matters. Still, this is way better than calling it "BitCoin."
I would prefer to see it read:

You're spending an unconfirmed output carrying a fee of 87 satoshis/byte:
The size of both transactions is 191 Bytes + 374 bytes = 565 bytes.
At a going rate of 279 satoshis/byte:
your second transaction needs to pay a fee (in the child-pays-for-parent sense) of 158,000 satoshis to cover both transactions. It only pays 66,000 satoshis.
So, even though you're paying an exorbitant rate for the child transaction, the parent was large and skimped on the fee.

That depends on segwit's rate of adoption. There is a financial incentive to adopt witness transactions because they can take advantage of the extra block space whereas base transactions can't.

Electrum supports child-pays-for-parent (CPFP). Spend an output on the transaction that belongs to you, but pay a fee sufficient to cover both transactions.
In the future, consider using RBF. To see the option when making a payment, you need to enable RBF under settings. You must choose RBF from the beginning, otherwise most nodes will ignore your replacement transactions.
If you did that and this happened again, you could bump the fee higher and keep doing so until the transaction confirmed.

It's also interesting to note that reporting Bitcoin Cash as taxable income effectively tells the IRS how much Bitcoin you held as of Aug. 1.
The worst part of this is figuring out how much Bitcoin Cash was worth on Aug. 1. It had a price even before its blocks were produced.
This could all get very complicated very quickly. A tiny group of users creates a fork and manages to get the coin listed on a small exchange. They trade among themselves and drive the price up. It defies logic to hold Bitcoin users liable every time something like this happens, and I suspect it will happen a lot in the coming year.
Or worse, a malevolent group decides to airdrop alt/metacoin tokens on all Bitcoin users, then drives up price using the same market manipulation technique. There's no end to the tax ambiguity something like this could cause.
What distinguishes a token with a valid tradable market and therefore actual value from one manipulated by a small group and which happens to show up on some random website like coinmarketcap? It's unreasonable to expect Bitcoin users to keep up with all the shenanigans in altcoin space.

If the block size limit were raised to 32 MB, then you could do the same. Yet raising the block size limit requires a hard fork update.

The system in the article doesn't generally seem to make the trader any profit because the $GBTC and BTC markets aren't fully connected. If the spread between $GBTC and BTC widens, then I can see a profit being made, which seems to be the case here.

I can see how you could come to that conclusion - oops.
The revocation mechanism only works through a contract that you had already approved. An attacker wouldn't be able to cheat a merchant by revoking arbitrary transaction off-chain after payment.
Bitcoin would still work as before. You give the payee an address and s/he pays to it. If they don't, you don't release the product.
The address  sets the terms under which the payment can be spent by you. You're in complete control over that, and the payee simply locks the payment to *your* specification. That's, in effect, what an address is - a way for you to tell the payee how to lock the payment so that you can later spend it.
But you *could* tell the payee to lock a payment in a way it could later be revoked off-chain - under the right conditions. You would do such a thing to get something in return from the payee - like a way to send money back-and-forth off chain.
@_date: 2016-06-14 21:26:05
More likely than not those transactions are off-chain because new users have no idea how to secure their own money properly. Raising the block size limit won't change this because the root problem is poor usability and lack of existing experience with cryptographic key pairs (the MtGox Effect).

checksequenceverify (CSV) is a group of 3 BIPs that will enable *relative* time locks. This will let you lock money for a predetermined period after your transaction confirms. The time can be a time measured in multiples of 512 seconds or a block count.
AFAICT, CSV is useful by itself, but it will probably get the most use in more complex contracts like payment channels (Lightning Network) , where it can enable something that might seem impossible: payments that can be revoked off-chain. This simplifies 2-way payment channels implemented with a single contract.

+1 for Steel Man Argument. We need a lot more of that going on in Bitcoin. Be very wary of people who either can't or won't clearly state their opponent's position.




Heart's point about bad user interface for Bitcoin could (and should) be an entire debate in itself. Being your own bank, and all the responsibility that entails, might appeal to some. But it's terrifying and repellant to the vast majority of people who derive no satisfaction from holding paranoid vigil against network-based attacks that steal private keys, and privacy intrusions.
Watch the debate between Ver and Heart jump off the rails (talking about Ethereum and ICOs) as this usability point is swept away.
It sounded like the direction Heart was heading would have been useful. Bitcoin's use cases are minuscule at the moment. Mass adoption isn't only not at hand, but may never happen at all. Treating Bitcoin as if it were ready for mass adoption ignores the very real problem that people generally don't want to manage their own money. Exhibit A is Mt. Gox, Coinbase, and all of the other bank-like institutions in Bitcoin's history in which people trusted themselves less than they trusted a third party to manage their own money.
For the handful of Bitcoin's strong use cases that remain, fees are nowhere close to being high.
Lack of honest discussion and Steel Manning around Bitcoin's major usability issues has led to many pointless discussions and counterproductive bridge-burning during the Great Scaling Drama.

Scaling a public, censorship-resistant block chain is an unsolved computer science problem. You're participating in an experiment. This is why so few people bother to be early adopters.
At this point the experiment suggests a fundamental conflict between large scale (in terms of users) and censorship-resistance.

Bitcoin is electronic cash. It works very much like paper notes and metal coins, but has no materiality whatsoever. That means that unlike physical tokens used for payment, bitcoin can be exchanged instantaneously with any party in the world.
The problem with electronic cash tokens is preventing reuse ("double spending"). I give an electronic token to Alice, then turn around and give the same electronic token to Bob. Neither Alice nor Bob know that I've created money out of thin air.
All previous solutions to this problem involved a central mint that knew about every previous transaction, and so could detect double spending.
Bitcoin eliminates the central mint, replacing it with a worldwide P2P network of autonomous, self-selecting mints sometimes called "miners."

This is a commonly-given scenario. What it ignores is the cost for a supernode to operate.
To relay a payment, a node requires a non-zero balance in the channel. When a channel approaches zero, it is likely to be closed by the counterparty to prevent an exhaustion attack. In this attack, the party with a zero balance publishes a previous channel state in an attempt to steal the money. This can't be punished because there is no money for the other party to take.
So LN nodes will likely close channels shortly before exhaustion. A supernode servicing thousands or hundreds of thousands of peers would need to stake enough money to keep all of those channels open. Given the low barrier to entry, competition will likely be fierce and fees low. So a supernode operator would need to consider whether making X% return is worth the risk of theft due to network based attacks (node must operate hot wallet).

I think I'm starting to understand why Janssens looks down on full nodes. He doesn't appear to understand the benefits of running one.
Here are the benefits he thinks proponents are claiming:


SPV nodes can't detect when peers lie by omission. The only way you know whether an output has been spent is if the nodes you connect to give you the transaction that does so. If your peers don't do so, you can't conclude with any certainty one way or the other if an output has been spent. They could be lying by omission.
Miners may or may not be involved; whether a peer generates blocks is irrelevant. Any node you connect to can decide to withhold transactions for any reason. And the only way you can tell is if at least one node gives you the transaction (and Merkle path) proving the coin was spent.


Anyone who has used Google search while logged in (and even then) knows that Google owns you. When you search for something, you reveal intent. The same applies for SPV nodes searching for transactions  through a peer. The peer comes to learn a lot about what you're interested in and can potentially link all your transactions together. In so doing, your peer undoes all of your hard work to avoid re-using keys.


Nodes operated by diverse groups make censorship of transactions more difficult. Bitcoin's entire value proposition is based on censorship-resistance. If any one group can censor your transaction from the network (preventing it from being propagated to a miner), you might lose the ability to spend "your" money. Without censorship-resistance, Bitcoin makes no sense.


Maybe some uninformed people make such statements, but there's no way to prevent a miner from publishing a block, nor should there be (see the previous point).
However, a full node can detect a block invalid due to bad data in the block body. An SPV node can't do this.
There are many pieces of misinformation in the remainder of the essay. Here are some selections:


I know of no serious, knowledgeable person claiming that everyone in the world needs to run a full node. Bitcoin security and privacy lie on a spectrum. You can trade security/privacy for convenience, and people have done that from the beginning.
One of the best ways to homogenize the group of people who run nodes is to make running a node as difficult and expensive as possible.


Gobsmacked. If this is the man's vision for Bitcoin, I can only wish him luck re-inventing Liberty Reserve. 
Behind this startling statement appears to be a deep-seated desire for fast payments. Re-read the white paper - that's outside the scope of Bitcoin. There are ways to make fast payments work within the context of censorship-resistant electronic cash, but they require a bit more thought and effort than raising the block size limit to infinity and beyond.

To an extent, yes.
For example, Armory doesn't support compressed public keys. If you see an Alice-pays-Bob style transaction where the inputs all use uncompressed public keys and one output does too, you know that's Alice's change address. You also can suspect that Alice may be using Armory.
Similarly, Copay uses P2SH addresses exclusively (address starts with "3"), even for a single user account (or at least did). These are much less common that P2PKH addresses (starts with "1"). When all the payees use P2PKH, you know where the change ends up. You can also guess Alice uses Copay (or at a minimum, some other P2SH-aware wallet).
It's important to realize that privacy in Bitcoin is shades of gray, not black-and-white. You give away your privacy a little bit at a time. That's also how investigators piece together your identity.
If you're wondering about Bitcoin privacy in broader terms, the two keywords that will help the most are "pseudonymity" and "chain of ownership".

It may be nothing, but without an optional commitment to witness root hash in the coinbase transaction, doesn't covert ASICBoost still work? In other words, can't miners "opt-into" covert ASICBoost indefinitely?

So far I've seen not much that leads automatically to that conclusion. It's a little like saying that the exchange rate can never fall because it's a bidding war. Eventually, an equilibrium will be established.
If anything, the widespread use of smart-fee wallets could make pileups like this less common. It really depends on what's causing them.
For example, some have suggested that the large number of long unconfirmed transaction chains during all of the past episodes points to a coordinated effort to flood the network with junk transactions.
A network in which wallets responded in a concerted way to such attacks would quickly raise the cost of sustaining them, dulling their effect.
If, on the other hand, these bursts are caused by random events and are not coordinated attacks, you could be right.
Either way, it seems safe to say that the reality will be 1 MB blocks for the foreseeable future. Wallet developers need to adapt to that reality.

This is the kind of use case Bitcoin was created for. Trusted third party often has conflict-of-interest elsewhere and you're caught in the middle.
FWIW, it really is possible to accept Bitcoin without a captive middleman. For example:

Every intermediate transaction other than channel open and close ends up being thrown away - not aggregated and put into a block. That latter statement seems like it would cause confusion. The former statement is accurate and concisely explains what's going on.
Can you explain the chain of logic that gets you from "keeping intermediate transactions out of blocks" to "this isn't Bitcoin?"
@_date: 2017-08-09 15:19:11


I've seen the "IOU" statement before and find it misleading at best. What you're trading is unconfirmed transactions - just like Bitcoin. The only difference is that these transaction only occasionally get broadcast to the Bitcoin network.


Where are you getting this from? A two-way channel can remain open indefinitely. There have been various proposals for implementing LN over the years, and earlier proposals did have this limitation as a workaround for missing transaction features. These features have all been added and a channel can stay open for years at a time if so desired.


The same is true for receiving bitcoin. To spend it you'll need to pay a fee at some point. You can avoid incurring the cost of opening a channel by ensuring that your payer pays directly into it. Your payee can do the same. If you don't do these things, then yes, fee costs will be higher.


True. DoS protection is one of those areas where LN is weak. You can end up opening a channel with someone who refuses to transact. Closing the channel costs you time and money. That creates a market for reputation. You're going to want to open channels with reliable counterparties. That could harm privacy.


Centralization is a legitimate risk. It seems to crop up everywhere in Bitcoin. One factor that will work against centralization is the need to keep all funds in hot wallets - ready for theft via network-based attacks. No doubt some organizations will try anyway, but they will eventually fail and be driven out of business. The negative feedback loop could force LN nodes to keep relatively little money on hand and therefore limit the capacity of any one player.


That could be a very expensive proposition, both in terms of capital, and in terms of hot wallet security.


Bitcoin isn't for the poor. I would really like it to be, but it's not. The last eight years have proven this time and again.

Yes, provided that you flagged your transaction as replaceable before you signed it (or you're spending an unconfirmed replaceable transaction output). If you didn't, you'll need to take additional steps to clear the transaction.
Use a wallet like Electrum that allows you to mark your transactions as replaceable. To learn what's going on underneath, the term to search is "replace by fee."

This is one of the best "critique my cold storage" posts I've seen, and I've seen and responded to a lot of them. A few points follow, but keep in mind you're already 90% of the way there and may be fine as you are.


One school of thought is to keep your seed in unencrypted form on paper. Then store this paper in a very secure location. You're probably more likely to lose your funds due to forgetting an encryption password than an attack. People tend to be much better at physical security than digital security.


Another thing you might want to consider is privacy. You can implement something like "Merge Avoidance" by thinking about how you're most likely to spend those coins in the future:
After considering the privacy implications a bit more, it might make sense to buy some of these coins from a more private source than Coinbase, and mark them as such. You can use Electrum's "coin control" features to spend exactly the coin you want to spend in any given situation.


If your laptop supports it, you might want to consider a DVD, which is not rewritable - either remotely or by someone obtaining the physical medium.


As others have pointed out, the paper on which you wrote your seed *is* your paper wallet. Using a printer increases the risk that you'll run into an exploit (risk goes up with printer sophistication):


This is the step that almost everyone fails to do. You have, which means you know how this works front and back. You're in a much better position to avoid the worst rookie mistakes, and ensure you can calmly work through anything that comes out of left field.


Yes, although there are those who would respond that only virgin hardware, never before or after connected to the network, is used in cold storage. I'm not one of them.

The minute you decide to single out a certain kind of transaction for exclusion (or a certain value of payment), you've made a deeply political decision. You've broken someone's business model. You've cause someone's bet to turn sour. Somewhere along the line you've moved someone's cheese.

Your counterparty will charge a fee. The service that matches you and your counterparty will charge a fee. And the LN will may charge a fee. Overall, fees may be lower, but there's no reason to think that LN or segwit will eliminate fees from Bitcoin or cross-chain swaps.
So it might become profitable to chase those smaller swings, but I wouldn't hold my breath for 0 fees.

Running a full node is the most private way to query the block chain. You ask for every single transaction so there's no way to tell what you actually care about.
Every other method puts an intermediary between you and a much smaller subset of the block chain. And that intermediary can be compromised. The risk varies, but he principle remains.

Now try teleporting one ounce of gold from New York to Singapore. Or... Try crossing a national boundary with a suitcase of gold bars. How much would you be willing to pay for those privileges?


What destroys that ability is a severe lack of technical infrastructure needed to secure private keys, run nodes and SPV wallets, and even learn how to use Bitcoin in a way that money and privacy can be secured. The payment network problem has largely been solved with cell phones and systems like mpesa. Bitcoin brings almost nothing to that table.

That's a good point. So we can keep the same total fee revenue with a 10x fee rate cut if we can get 10x more transactions into the block chain.
I don't discount this idea, but merely ask you to think about what effect that will have on the network. Specifically, the number of full nodes. Users have already abandoned Bitcoin Core (the wallet) and Armory in droves because the sync time (despite heroic efforts by the Core team) is routinely 8 hours or much longer even on good equipment. Running on a VPS gets more expensive all the time - mainly due to disk space requirements.
With each honest node that goes offline, Bitcoin becomes a little more like PayPal. That's ok for some I suppose, but not me.

There's only been one, so the sample set is pretty small. It occurred in 0.8.1, which both lowered and then a few months later raised the number of unique txids that could be referenced in a block.

The problem is that miners voluntarily identify themselves, so there's really no way to know how broadly distributed hash power is, nor is there a way to get much reliable data about collusion.

Yes, a channel can remain open indefinitely. There is no pre-set expiration. Whether or not payment channels make sense for large-valued transactions remains an open question, though.

It can work unidirectionally or bidirectionally. Unidirectional channels are simpler to administer.
Alice can publish previous channel state because she has Bob's signature on it. She just adds her own and the transaction is valid.

Figure this out *before* buying large amounts of bitcoin. If you already bought, the best advice I can give is to sell it and don't buy again until you understand how to secure your own money.
In the meantime,  research "cold storage." When you find a storage plan that seems reasonable, ask here for a review.
Then buy a few bucks worth and practice your plan - repeatedly - until you make no mistakes. Your plan should include a disaster recover scenario in which the worst possible thing happens but your money is safe.
There are step-by-step guides, but they will be useless to you until you understand Bitcoin at a fundamental level. You might start with the idea of electronic cash (hint: it's the fundamental step that almost every beginner skips - to their detriment):
@_date: 2017-08-02 21:20:02
My understanding is the Bitcoin Cash nodes will reject any transaction lacking the SIGHASH_FORKID bit:
Bitcoin nodes will reject any such transaction as invalid. That's how 2-way replay protection has been implemented.
If you sent this transaction from a Bitcoin-only wallet, then your transaction will only be confirmed on the Bitcoin network.

@_date: 2017-08-20 17:25:13
Yes. Either party can close the channel at any time.
If you close the channel, you'll need to wait for a timeout to expire before spending the refund.
If your counterparty closes the channel, you can spend your refund immediately.
This arrangement is part of the system of penalties that can be applied when one party decides to cheat by publishing a previous invalidated channel state.

Operating as an oracle can eliminate this burden. As an oracle, you simply report events. The simplest way to do this is the periodically publish the pre-image of a hash value. Users include the hash value in their on-chain, hash-locked contracts.
Publishing your hash value allows one of the two parties to claim funds from their jointly-controlled multisignature output.
For example, see:
Unfortunately, this isn't the best discussion. If you don't get the idea, let me know.
Your site can then focus on bringing counterparties together and reporting results. You never need to hold the money.

In a few weeks, this could be quite significant.
Zooming back to the last 4 months or so reveals a possible longer-term pattern:
@_date: 2017-08-16 15:03:20
Two blocks can reference the same parent. Such blocks are known as siblings. Two or more siblings at a given block height start a chain split. Chain splits occur routinely at the rate of a couple per month or so:
Eventually all but one of the sibling blocks will be disregarded by the network and become "stale." This is the core of Bitcoin's consensus algorithm, consisting of three main rules:
1. Accept and store a valid sibling for any block (with the possible exception of very old blocks when using "checkpoints"). This produces a tree, with the Genesis Block at the head.
2. Starting at the Genesis Block, find the path through the tree with the most cumulative proof-of-work. This is the "strongest" path.
3. If two paths have equal strength, pick the one whose last block ("tip") you saw first. This path is known as the "active chain."
When a new block arrives, begin at step (1). This can cause a node to adopt a new active chain. This process is known as "reorganization." Reorganizations vary in length. When a hard fork update is deployed (as was done just a few weeks ago), the nodes that were updated run the risk of experiencing very long reorganizations (or "wipeouts"). Wipeout protection is essential to ensure the hard fork can survive.
Each node runs the same algorithm. Because the process of selecting an active chain is dynamic, and the block generation interval is sufficiently long, two arbitrary nodes are more likely than not to use the same active chain.
This is what's known as "consensus."

Interesting you should bring up banks. One of the slogans you sometimes see is "be your own bank."
But it turns out to be your own bank, you must act like a bank. And for many people, this is no fun. It applies not only to being aware of transaction fees, but also being aware of the security and privacy tradeoffs for the various ways of using Bitcoin. Spend some time searching through this forum for posts about the many ways privacy and money can be lost accidentally and non-intuitively, and you'll get the picture.
It's for these kinds of reasons that the idea of Bitcoin "mass adoption" seem very, very far away. Decades, not years.

Very well done series and much needed.


This is the part about Lightning that may not be obvious. The parties are using the Bitcoin protocol, and they're exchanging real, valid transactions. And they're doing real, valuable work with those transactions.
But the Bitcoin network itself is only needed twice: once to open the channel and once to close it. It's a very different way of thinking about how Bitcoin works and the role of the Bitcoin network.

No. Miners charge what the market will bear.
Part of what the market will bear is determined by how much block space there is (the "supply" side of supply and demand). Segwit expands block space, but only for transactions using the pay-to-witness template.


Miners are not obligated to include any witness transactions. If they don't, then no witness data are needed and AFAIK, private ASICBoost still works.


Wallets will use segwit because users will demand it, and user will demand it because they want to pay lower fees (block space only increases if you're using segwit).
Exchanges will use segwit mainly for the same reason I suspect.
The other main motivation to use segwit will be Lightning Network. Getting on will require a segwit transaction.

Only to the extent that the exchanges need instant settlement.
Remember that a channel can't be "topped-up." In other words, you can't keep feeding money into a channel. When the channel empties on your side, a new channel needs to be opened if you want to keep pushing value. In which case, you might as well do an on-chain transaction.
This is one factor that has been cited as a natural barrier to LN supernodes. Scaling up costs big money to keep all the channels open and useful bidirectionally.
@_date: 2017-08-02 21:08:34


appears to be inconsistent with this:


I interpret "segwit rules" to mean all of segwit's rules, including the part about a P2WPKH transaction requiring the correct witness data for validation.
Until segwit locks in, nodes should treat a P2WPKH transaction today just as they would have before the segwit lock-in. Which is to say spending requires no signature. After lock-in, spending requires a signature and P2WPKH transaction become standard.
Or am I missing something?

Decentralization isn't the end-goal - it's censorship-resistance.
If you never know whether your payment will be processed, you don't have much of a store of value.

Yes, Bitcoin's Script system doesn't get nearly the attention it deserves.


Even something like that is possible. I'm not sure how practical it might be to gather inputs from 4-5 different sources, but in terms of what Bitcoin Script can do, I don't see any red flags. You might check out "JoinMarket" for inspiration.


What I'm getting at is that each party would be in charge of its own private keys. The trading platform could offer a method for the parties to collaboratively build the necessary transaction. That transaction's output is locked in such a way that the correct party can spend by supplying a signature and some other proof - for example, a hash value preimage corresponding to the winning outcome, as reported by your oracle.
The funding transaction remains invalid until the last person signs. You you may even be able to build in a refund to prevent loss of funds if the oracle stops responding.

If remotely successful, and there's every reason to think it will reach at least that low bar, altcoin developers will rethink how supply is initially distributed. Hard forking from an existing valid block may become a much more common mode of distribution.
Kind of amazing this hasn't happened before, actually. I know, there were attempts to create altcoins using an airdrop-style mechanism. But I'm talking about a hard fork from a recent valid block.
You get a built-in network of users for almost nothing. You trade the ability to premine. For those trying to create altcoins that appeal to Bitcoin users, this is a sound strategy.
Should that happen, the race will be on to create the most compelling hard fork. There could be dozens within a year.

To summarize, a man made a trip to Kenya to prove that Bitcoin can help developing countries pull themselves out of poverty, and ended up proving the opposite. A few years later, Bitcoin has made almost no inroads in Kenya or any other developing country.

It relies on finding a pushtx API that will re-broadcast a double spend to a miner who will accept the higher fee. With the decline of Bitcoin XT and the political blowback from RBF, it's possible that those nodes are now all gone. As of a few months ago, the procedure worked with the localbitcoins pushtx form.

You settle a channel on the block chain by closing it. To close a channel, you publish the most recent state. That state is encoded as an ordinary Bitcoin transaction.


Not IOUs, the Bitcoin transaction representing the most recent channel state.


Closing a channel just means publishing the last channel state, which is simply a signed Bitcoin transaction spending the original deposit.


Every payment must be a valid Bitcoin transaction. So you use the existing tools to validate at low level. At a higher level, you make sure the transaction's outputs are always correct for the current channel state.

Hasn't this already been done?
Big block proponents will have not one but two options: BCC or segwit2x (assuming its hard fork starts). So much of the opposition to segwit seems to have been rooted in wanting bigger blocks. Now that there's already a chain that lacks segwit, and which increases the block size limit, it will be interesting to see how much support segwit2x can muster.


When viewed from the perspective of a BCC maximalist, perhaps. From the perspective of a BTC maximalist, max_block_size is just as relevant today as when it was introduced.

It is a blockspace increase, but in a very counterintuitive way.
Block size is no longer a limit. Block weight is the limiting quantity now. And block weight may not exceed 4 MB. This includes "base transactions" and "witness transactions."
A block containing only base transactions may not exceed 1 MB. A block containing some witness transactions could be as large as 4 MB. That's unlikely to happen under normal use though.

It makes Bitcoin more useful as programmable money. Time is a critical element in many financial transactions, and CSV adds a powerful new tool for building time constraints into contracts.

Segwit fixes a longstanding bug in Bitcoin: transaction malleability. Unfortunately, segwit does a lot of other stuff, which has confused the bejesus out of many users.
The effects of malleability are easy to explain, but understanding the causes - not so much. When you spend the payment from a transaction, you reference it by ID. If that ID changes, your spending transaction becomes invalid. Since the beginning, it has been possible for anyone, not just the signer, to change a transaction ID without invalidating the signature or transaction. That's malleability.
Lightning Network, in its most useful form, requires the creation of transactions that spend unconfirmed payments. This takes place when a channel opens.
Segwit closes the malleability bug, making Lightning, and many other advanced uses of Bitcoin, practical.

The first link describes the "Silkroad Trader attack":


Essentially, you pay Silk Road by initiating a payment request from Overstock using the Payment Protocol. Then you return the merchandise and request a refund, which flows into the Silk Road address you used in your original request.
You never signed that request, so you can deny having had anything to do with it. Overstock ends up paying Silk Road for the products you ordered there.
This is a legitimate merchant concern, especially given the regulatory and/or shareholder scrutiny the larger of them will be under.
If anything, BIP 75 closes this loophole.
Having worked through this example, however, what follows begins to sound sinister. Concerned with the Silkroad Trader attack, Overstock (or BitPay or Coinbase) begin to require BIP 75 for *all* transactions.
One by one, online merchants switch to a policy of BIP 75 payments only. No bare addresses. No bare Payment Protocol.
Not so good...

Hard to say if it was an attack or a surge. That's largely a value judgement anyway, it seems.
The take home for me, though, is that the network took it in stride. During the high volume episode, fees went up, but those transactions paying a market fee density received next block confirmation.
Like the half dozen or so previous episodes, fees dropped after the surge had abated.
@_date: 2017-08-29 16:19:40
I prefer the term "block subsidy" over "block reward" for a reason. Hodlers are subsidizing network security through inflation at this point. And it's temporary.
When the subsidy ends, all security must be funded through fees (vague proposals for "assurance contracts" notwithstanding). A (over) simple model would suggest that what is now being paid in subsidy will by 2024 be paid in fees. This doesn't account for things like raising the block size limit, the effect of Lightning Network, or dozens of innovations that might take place between now and then.

Welcome. You have questions - many questions. The answers are out there.
The best advice I can give is to learn how to use Electrum (and Bitcoin itself) first before using either as a way to store money. This forum is peppered with newbies who went down the path you're travelling only to regret it. Your biggest enemies are your emotions and ignorance at this point.
Take a few steps back. And commit to learning about Bitcoin. Store only a few euro worth of bitcoin on Electrum. If you bought more, consider converting to local currency and waiting until you're confident you know what you're doing. Use those few euro worth to understand the basics of sending and receiving, and doing cold storage.
Then post your questions, one at a time. It's not an easy road, but it's the best one I know.
I found this video very helpful when I started with Electrum. You may too. A lot of the specific info will be outdated, but the principles remain.

The technical documentation on CLAMs is pretty weak, but it looks like the model was airdrop, not hard fork. For example, block 1 has a timestamp dated from 2014:
This is basically the Auroracoin model, but the identity database is the UTXO set of various block chains.
OTOH, Bitcoin Cash appears to be a fundamentally new kind of altcoin. One where everything works more or less like Bitcoin: block chain; addresses; scripts; client software; previous token ownership. Everything is nearly compatible (save for segwit - at least for now) and only might need a gently nudge.
Now, Cash could crash and burn for boneheaded technical or economic reasons. But the concept of building an altcoin through a Bitcoin block chain hard fork seems viable to me.
The hard thing to do is separate one's personal preference from demonstrated market demand. And the last year has demonstrated an almost insatiable appetite for tokens and altcoins. If they avoid shooting themselves in the foot, Cash and hard forked altcoins could be big.

The main problem with segwit is its complexity. It's the most complex update to Bitcoin since its inception. This has lead to deep misunderstanding of its scope, limitations, and even purpose. This in turn led to strong opposition and concerns about security.

Vitalik and the Ethereum Foundation have deliberately and conspicuously placed themselves at the head of a large financial system. As it gains traction, this system will be used increasingly to issue what looks like securities, transfer what looks like drug money, or secure what looks like stolen property.
These are all problems for Bitcoin as well. But as we've seen, the lack of a clear top-down organizational system has made it nearly impossible to do anything but work at the periphery. Ethereum is providing ever more leverage for law enforcement and investigators to move much closer to the protocol itself.
Governance may be the single trickiest issue in cryptocurrency. Gavin and others repeatedly argued that Bitcoin needs a strong leader. Now that the Ethereum Foundation has set the wheels in motion toward exactly that end, we will all have a chance to see what it leads to.

I can completely understand the frustration. What used to be routine (sending $25) with Bitcoin has become a non-starter.
The activation of segwit will do almost nothing in the short term to alleviate the problem. Disappointment will only deepen and users who thought an end was in sight realize that the destruction of use cases from the bottom up can continue for a long time.
At the moment, there are no good solutions. There are solutions that look good in the short term (Bitcoin Cash, some other alts), but whose long term prospects look dim. There are solutions that look good in the long term (Lightning Network and other secure off-chain solutions), but which will require the construction of a vast array of infrastructure before being fully functional.
There's really nothing that will alleviate the symptoms of hyper-growth in the intermediate term.
Bitcoin is undergoing a transition from an idea that showed promise to one showing results. It's now growing faster than Moore's Law can keep pace with, and its users are both reaping the rewards and feeling the pain.

Pull a silver dollar from your pocket. Recap its features. There is a face value. There is an underlying currency unit. Value is exchanged as the coin changes hands. You can give the coin to him (hand it to him). He can give the coin to you (ask for it back). As this is happening, note that there's nobody in between you facilitating the transaction. You can both check the coin's authenticity by examining its security features.
Bitcoin is a system that works in a very similar way, but with one big difference: the coins are made of data, not metal. This means that ownership can change without the two of you being in the same room or on the same continent. For the first time, it's possible to exchange something with the monetary properties of cash but the transportability of digital photos.
Bitcoin had to solve a lot of technical problems to make this work. If your family member is still listening, it might be a good time to talk about them.

Even when segwit activates, don't hold your breath for a fee reduction. Unfortunately, segwit was marketed as a capacity increase in its own right, but it does little toward this end given the very high transaction volumes we've been seeing. This has lead to a lot of confusion and will result in a lot of disappointment.
Segwit's biggest contribution to scaling is to cure the malleability bug preventing Lightning and other off-chain scaling solutions from working to their full potential.
But those solutions are far from being ready to implement.

It's  hard to overstate the importance of this step. Your AML/KYC exchange is not your friend or ally. Before you can disentangle yourself from their numerous conflicts of interest using a Trezor or other cold storage system, you must have a plan for recovering your funds in the event of hardware or software failure.
Imagine your cold storage hardware (e.g., Trevor) were lost in a fire at your house. How would you recover the money you had so dilligently DCAed over the years?
Have a recovery plan. Run it by someone who knows what they're doing. Practice the plan with very small amounts of money. Only then begin dollar cost averaging.

The most interesting and durable Lightning Network applications will do the things that Bitcoin can't do:
- instant, irreversible payments;
- low valued payments; and
- high frequency payments.
Notice how these three categories of use have essentially no support through any mechanism at the present. You can't use PayPal to make instant irreversible payments. You can't use a credit card to transact fractions of a penny at a time. You can't use wire transfers or Western Union to make/receive high frequency payments.
Because payment channels will make things possible that just weren't possible before, I suspect that we'll see entirely new business models emerge. These use cases will be immune to competition from the traditional financial sector (for both technical and business reasons) while at the same time serving potentially wide swaths of the world's population.
There's something else sitting out there that hasn't really been discussed very much. Using protocols such as Colored Coins allows you to tag a digital token, treating it as a separate asset class. This hasn't taken off in Bitcoin to the extent it has on platforms like Ethereum.
But merging the Colored Coins idea with high-frequency, cryptographically secured settlement means that we can start to think of new kinds of secure, automated asset markets that barely touch the block chain.
Alternatively, the ability to use hashed timelock contracts across block chains could accomplish almost the same thing:

One of the more interesting ideas is atomic cross-chain swaps.
This would allow you to trade digital assets across block chains without a third party escrow (e.g., ShapeShift). You'd still need a marketplace for buyers and sellers to post orders, but there would be no need for a third party to hold funds.
Greater liquidity and better security when trading alts means that those alts could, in principle, start to play some of the roles previously considered only within sidechains. For example, CoffeeCoin could be used to make small payments, and its security model/valuation would be based around the tradeoffs needed to make that happen. And whatever happens on CoffeeCoin stays on CoffeeCoin. In other words, one size need no longer fit all.
The magic behind this (and Lightning Network) is hashed timelock contracts (HTLCs). The idea is that two transactions can be bound together with a contract. And that contract may span two (or more?) different block chains. Atomic swaps of this kind are a requirement in many kinds of complex financial transactions.
Another application is TumbleBit - think of a tumbler that can't steal your money or privacy:
HTLCs are now feasible in their most useful form now that segwit has activated. I suspect there will be more applications to come.
Another thing that doesn't get much attention is that Bitcoin's Script system can now be upgraded in much more sweeping ways. If you don't know, when Alice pays Bob one bitcoin, she's actually writing a contract in a custom programming language called Script to make that happen. The very language that these contracts are written in can now be changed, meaning more complex forms of trustless interactions may become possible.

Strength: sum of proof-of-work for each block in a chain

I'm in the middle of researching this now. From what I gather, there are multiple levels of Lightning (1, 2, 3), and each one becomes more useful/convenient than the last. CSV isn't required, but it brings in additional features.
The main problem with CLTV is that you don't know when the parent transaction will be confirmed. For example, if you're trying to set up a refund in a contract, you might want the refund to become spendable X blocks in the future from some point in time. And you don't necessarily know that time at the outset. Lightning seems to have some additional requirements around this:

The discussion on non-Bitcoin applications of the block chain was nuanced and worth listening to. If I understood, Peter thinks that block chains without Bitcoin (or proof-of-work) could be valuable to the banks and other institutions looking into them. However, useful, doesn't necessarily mean interesting - for the same reasons that double-entry bookkeeping can be both useful but not very interesting.
IMO, this is the level that banks need to be talking about "Blockchain." It's an extension of bookkeeping methods that brings powerful cryptographic tools to bear. There may be other advantages as well, but equating any permissioned block chain used by a bank with the censorship-resistant one one used by Bitcoin is equivalent to confusing "car" with "carpet."

The author has repeated some of the same mistakes users have been making from the beginning:
The biggest problem is that the author didn't take network-based attacks as the serious threat that they are. It's possible he is still under attack. There was no mention taking steps to address the risk of ongoing attack, but that would seem prudent given what the attacker found in Evernote and what the author has revealed about his security practices.
Regarding Bitcoin specifically, the main problem is that the author began using bitcoin without understanding it. Note that "using a hardware wallet" would not have protected the author against the attack, because the mnemonic sentence was stored in a way that made it vulnerable to network-based attack.
The author was fundamentally unqualified to use bitcoin. This is not a personality defect, just a question of training. I usually suggest that new users who have bought "derection"-level sums of bitcoin to sell almost all of it and use the remainder to teach themselves how to do Bitcoin security right. I doubt many take that advice in all the FOMO-level hoopla. For every person willing to spill their guts like the author, there are probably dozens who suffered the same kind of loss but just don't talk about it.

I suspect it could have something to do with syncing when Bitcoin Core also uses a wallet, but haven't tested that idea yet. In my tests, I used default settings for everything, which gives me a wallet.
When using a wallet, Bitcoin Core itself must create an index to be able to report balances and watch transactions. In effect, it's doing what Armory does, and that would be wasted effort if all you care about is the block chain itself.
In fact, if you're using Armory, you don't need the Bitcoin Core wallet at all.

It almost always comes to come down to port forwarding, and each router seems to have its own quirks.
I didn't see anything in your linked tutorial about UDP. That needs to be present, apparently:
It doesn't hurt to enable it in my experience. Also, make sure Bitcoin Core is running on port 8333 and that you're forwarding to that port. Core runs on that port by default.

I found your article (and the previous one on scaling) very helpful and well-researched. It would have been even better with a paragraph near the beginning linking to (or embedding) Peter R's slides and summarizing his belief that SPV can handle a billion users without "scaling concerns."

There are a few ways, including:
1. the key wasn't randomly generated and so was easily guessed. Google "brain wallet" for example.
2. re-use of the ephemeral key pair when signing two or more inputs/transactions
3. a private key of an HD wallet is accidentally released. When combined with the master public key, this reveals the master private key:

It's far from clear why he's making this comparison. Armory needs to compile a special index that isn't required by ordinary full nodes. And the less optimized that compilation process is, the more inefficient the sync stage.
This is best illustrated by ElectrumX, a reimplementation of Electrum server (which also needs to create custom indexes) that runs circles around the old:
That said, sync times for Bitcoin Core are awful on so-so hardware and a good network connection. At least two solid days, with the last one spent on just the last year's worth of transactions (full blocks wreak havoc on sync time). And just to process two weeks worth of transactions takes a few hours.
Bandwidth isn't the problem, as evidenced by the network activity panel. This appears to be an issue with block validation. However, that doesn't make sense because the slowdown I saw (twice) happens before the default `assumedvalid` optimization. Setting `assumedvalid` to one of that day's blocks also didn't help:

This thread from a few weeks ago about Bollinger band compression comes to mind:
@_date: 2017-08-29 13:38:21


I would put that under the umbrella of "reliability." It will be very important that the nodes you connect with are reliable. You want high enough connectivity to get your payment routed. But if the node has insufficient money in the channel to do so, your payment will become stuck.
Mere connectivity isn't enough - those connections must be sufficiently funded.
I haven't seen much work going on to assess the reliability of a proposed payment path on Lightning Network, and in my mind this is the single biggest technical unknown.
@_date: 2017-08-29 16:04:04
It would probably be best to create and sign the transaction well beforehand. Then just publish the signed transaction using a "pushtx" service like this one:
That leaves the problem of creating the signed transaction. OP_RETURN is designed specifically for this kind of thing. You can add an OP_RETURN output along with the $200 output.
There are a few options, depending on your technical skill. I haven't tried it myself, but I know Coinbin supports OP_RETURN outputs.
Click "Advanced Options" then check the box marked "Null Data". Enter your message in place of the address. This should generate an unsigned transaction. You sign in a separate step.
Keep the signed transaction on your phone and publish it at the event with the pushtx link above.
Note: You can lose money with this if you don't know what you're doing. Also, I strongly recommend downloading the Coinbin page and only using it to sign in a secure offline environment. If this doesn't make sense, you may want to do some more research.

If I understand correctly, yes. Create a new dummy wallet. Use this wallet to sweep your bc.i WIF keys. I would practice on a low-valued address and preferably only a couple of bucks worth to start with. If you don't have that handy, create it on bc.i wallet.
Also, think about why you want to sweep the bc.i wallet. You can probably save a lot of effort by simply making a regular transaction from bc.i into Electrum.

LN uses unconfirmed transactions to hold channel state. Imagine Alice and Bob each have 2 BTC in a channel and Alice pays Bob. Alice now holds two unconfirmed transactions, one that gives her 2 BTC (the first) and one that gives her 1 BTC (the second).
Alice can cheat by publishing the previous (now invalid) channel state, stealing 1 BTC from Bob.
LN gives Bob the ability to retaliate if Alice does this, stealing *all* of the 4 BTC from the channel. This is how unconfirmed transactions can be made revocable. Very clever.

The followers of a hard fork would only care to add replay protection if they thought the legacy chain would survive and be valuable. With replay protection, users of the new chain can continue to trade on the old one.
If, however, the followers of a new chain see the old chain as doomed, what's the point of replay protection? Individual users can add it themselves using time locked transactions.
The benefit of wipeout protection is clear. The hard fork is protecting itself from the possibility of a hash rate drop. 2x has already implemented wipeout protection with &gt;1 MB signal block. That's the only real technical requirement for securing the new chain. Replay protection adds nothing to the hard fork security package AFAICT.
2x is free to pursue either approach. Threatening legal action makes no sense and smells of fear.

In a general sense, Satoshi is talking about parties updating an unconfirmed transaction, potentially with very high frequency. When the parties are satisfied with the final state, they publish the transaction.
Lightning Network uses a different (more secure) mechanism to allow old states to be revoked, and it adds a routing mechanism to enable parties without direct channels to do the same thing, but the basic operation is very close to what Satoshi described.

Now that this has happened, the most important question is "what happens next?"
In his personal statement, Vitalik says:


This is an interesting position coming from someone who a lot of technically competent people will defer to, and stands in contrast to the repeated rejection of such calls that have been made in Bitcoin over the years (e.g., blacklist the MtGox withdrawal addresses).
However, Bitcoin did suffer an event with some similar qualities in March 2013. In fact, Vitalik himself wrote the definitive work on the subject. The solution was direct intervention by a group of interested parties, and the longest chain ended up being rolled back. Importantly, this didn't involve a hard fork update - that came later (the 0.8.1 update). Of this response, Vitalik wrote:


Both the March 2013 incident and today's incident raise serious questions around the tradeoffs of decentralization and whether fully decentralized money is even possible.
What's different about the ETH case is that even the proposed short-term solution can't resolve the problem: ETH can spawn many contracts that will ultimately become "too big to fail." This article offers a glimpse of what might be in store:
The insatiable appetite for financial speculation seems guaranteed to create similar situations in the future. Unlike Bitcoin, where MtGox and its ilk rise and fall without affecting the protocol in any way, huge Ethereum contracts that go haywire will be baked into the cake.

There's an idea out there that says that Bitcoin is about "the other six billion people." That Bitcoin can lift the world's poor out of poverty. That Bitcoin will level the economic playing field and usher a new era of fairness.
I'd like to believe these things, but find it hard to do so. The evidence simply does not exist. Bitcoin has not played a substantial role in a single economic flash point to date. Headlines - maybe, but not much of a role. There's no evidence of Bitcoin displacing any of the centralized, nontraditional payment systems in Africa such as M-Pesa. What I've seen out of Venezuela is that expatriates in the US invested in Bitcoin, the price appreciated, and the proceeds were sent back home.
Rather than banking the unbanked, it seems increasingly likely that Bitcoin's true calling is to unbank the banked. In other words, Bitcoin is a lifeboat for people with capital to protect.

You can't counter an argument unless you can clearly state it. The tweet doesn't even acknowledge the concern I've read far too many times it seems. Here's an attempt.
Blockstream Core is deliberately stunting the growth of block space. The goal is to raise fees and thereby create demand for centralized, second-layer solutions like side chains and Lightning Network. Having created the demand, Blockstream Core will then spring its trap by corralling Bitcoin users into a walled garden of its own creation. Fees formerly paid to miners will then be siphoned off to Blockstream Core through its many toll gates. Patents have been issued and will fortify a monopoly, thus repaying the big banking interests that financed Blockstream Core.
Like any conspiracy theory, this has a kind of internal logic that can be hard to get a handle on. Blockstream could do itself a service by publishing a clear business plan in which its current and planned revenue sources were clearly stated.
On the other hand, Blockstream and most other Bitcoin companies face a peculiar problem. The more efficiently Bitcoin works, the less it needs the services of third parties. The services that remain experience cut-throat competition because they're all based on open standards. Bitcoin excels at disintermediation, kicking the middle man to the curb. Most Bitcoin companies ignore this simple fact, hand-waving their way to profitability.
Either way, it should be clear that pointing to the revenues miners currently earn doesn't exactly address the main concern.
**Edit**: It seems that some may have interpreted the second paragraph as a statement of my own belief. To be clear, it is not. It is my interpretation of what a passionate group within Bitcoin has been saying for many months. If Bitcoin is going to make it through the many challenges ahead, those in a position to make changes need to at least be able to restate contrary opinions. And I don't think the tweet does that.

A channel must be funded to be useful. Exhaustion (all value lies with the counterparty) will result in closure to avoid an exhaustion attack. That means a supernode will need to fund all of its channels, fronting potentially vast amounts of money.
The low barrier to entry for running a node will probably keep fees low. So the supernode needs to factor the opportunity cost of money into the equation, and the result may not be very profitable.

I would hope that those who would attempt future protocol updates would consider the lessons that can be learned from the nearly failed attempt to deploy segwit. And that lesson is this: *complexity kills*. 
Complexity nearly killed a desperately-needed malleability fix. Segwit was (and is) very hard to understand and explain, contrary to statements made on the Bitcoin Core website. Segwit didn't focus on a single topic. It was a malleability fix. And it was a scaling fix. It introduced an economic incentive. And it sets the stage for script versioning. And Schnorr signatures. Very few people actually understand it.
All we really needed was to fix malleability. That was the last component needed to demonstrate a fully-functioning Lightning Network. A malleability fix would likely have been uncontroversial. Instead we got something that goes way beyond malleability.
While this is great from the perspective of a research project and the technology is way cool, we're talking about an economic platform now. Opponents raised a valid concern that segwit what just too complicated and therefore too risky to deploy securely. And they may yet be proven right.
Successful protocol updates, whether they be hard forks or soft forks, should be simple - in the Rich Hickey sense:


This doesn't mean "easy." It means the update focuses on a single topic. Until segwit, this was the norm (e.g., P2SH, CSV, CLTV). Segwit was not simple. It was the most complex update in Bitcoin's history. And the one thing Bitcoin absolutely needed to be able to settle the all-important scaling debate, a malleability fix, almost didn't happen as a result.
That said, hard forks will be even more difficult than any soft fork. The massive expenditure of time and energy will create pressure to do as few as possible. But the hard fork wish list has been growing for years. It's going to take an iron will and sharp focus on the future to avoid falling down the complexity rabbit hole with a hard fork update.
Relatively minor point about the article...


I don't follow. Bitcoin Cash required all transactions to be signed with the new SIGHASH_FORKID bit set. Segwit creates a completely new signature hashing algorithm, but the bits and semantics remain the same. There is no SIGHASH_FORKID in segwit. Or am I missing something?

You can repeatedly direct payments to the same address without affecting security.
However, every time you do this, you can leak privacy. In brief, an attacker can see all of your payments linked together on the block chain. That degrades your own privacy and the privacy of those with whom you transact.

You should know how to secure your own bitcoin - before making your purchase. If the idea of managing cryptographic material securely makes your head spin, stop and reconsider that you're probably going to end up like one of these poor folks:
You should know what happens when you fail to take backups or privacy seriously. You should know what it feels like to send your money into the void because you used the wrong receiving address or paid everything to miner's fees.
Learn these lessons by:
1. buying 10 euros of bitcoin
2. securing it with the best method you can find
3. having someone who knows what they're doing review your method
4. proving you can recover from complete loss of your phone, computer, or hardware wallet - without making a single mistake
BTW, these posts seem to always reach their peak near the beginning of a major correction. Consider how you'd feel and how you'd act when confronting a 75% loss on 10K.

Yes. Alternatively, your payment can be routed through channels that do have the capacity.


Bob can close his channel at any time without Carol being online. He must wait for the output's timeout to expire, which gives Carol the chance to penalize him if he cheats by publishing a previous channel state. After the timeout, Bob can spend his money.

Because your payer spent a coin with that face value.


Confirmations accrue as the chain containing the transaction is extended by one block. So 2900 blocks separate the one your transaction is on from the tip of the active chain.


It is your payer's change address.

Repeating my answer from If miner's aren't, I can't see how LN nodes would be:
That said, maybe the FinCen decision will rule in the future that miners should be considered money transmitters. It's hard to imagine how a ruling affecting one wouldn't be applied to the other.
If implemented with privacy in mind, however, a node would have no idea where its payment was being routed from or to - just that a node that it shares a channel with wants to pay or be paid. This would be sort of similar to how relay nodes work in Tor.

After your side of the channel is (close to) empty you'll need to either pull some money through it by requesting some from elsewhere on the network or open a new channel.
I say close to empty because your counterparty will never allow the channel to become empty. If it did, you could attempt to steal money from the channel by publishing a previous state, but with no penalty.

That's an idea that's already in progress (Bitcoin Cash). If you believe it can work, you have an option. Although it does appear to solve the problem in the short term, it introduces technical and economic liabilities that Bitcoin Cash will carry for its lifetime. In particular, I'm talking about the likely erosion of censorship resistance, and a change in perspective that starts to view block space, not as a limited resource, but as a new kind of distributed hard drive.
Here's the problem. How will you (or anyone else) conclude that "layer 2 solutions are ready and being used"? How will you put the brakes on raising the block size limit (after having done so several times already), and how will you respond to the howls of rage at the mere mention of the idea?

Operating a payment channel costs money. You can't serve as a source or relay without a funded channel. The more nodes you set up, the more channels you'll need to fund and the more bitcoin you'll have to hold.
A node is hot wallet. They are all vulnerable to theft if attacked. So there is a non-zero cost in terms of bitcoin to operate a node.
But... given that the budget for the NSA is classified, this may not be a problem.
@_date: 2018-06-03 05:32:56


Have you considered trying to memorize your seed as a fallback option?
Either way, you're going to need an unencrypted backup. So encrypting simply opens up more attack vectors and presents you with more footguns.


It's worse in the sense that if you forget the encryption key, game over. It's also worse in that if your forget the exact parameters of your encryption scheme, game over. Finally, if you choose a weak encryption key and your attacker knows what they're doing (time is on their side anyway), game over.

If you attempt to close the channel by publishing a previous state, you must wait for a timeout that allows your counterparty to take all the money from the channel. If your counterparty was going to do that anyway (because the channel is exhausted), there is no disincentive for you to publish an invalid state, thereby stealing money, on the hope that your counterpart won't respond in time.

According to Oxford, "bitcoin" is a mass noun and therefore has no plural:

A node connects to other nodes (or "peers"). The node and its peers relay valid messages in the form of transactions and blocks. If a node receives an invalid message (transaction or block), the message isn't relayed.
In this way, valid messages propagate through the network and invalid messages are censored.
A generating node (miner) goes one step further by attempting to generate a new block and publish it to peers.
Both roles are important and protect the network from attack.
Anyone with a PC, about 200 GB of disk space, and several days to sync can become a node. You will not be directly compensated in the way that miners are. However, a node will serve you well when connected to a wallet. It's the most secure and private way to use Bitcoin.

More of the same until something breaks. It's possible that EDA could be used with a time warp attack (mine 2x the coins at the same hash rate) to cause a large reorganization on Bitcoin Cash.
If not, blocks separated by &lt; 1 minute may lead to reorganizations and loss of money.
The problem with removing EDA is that there are so many ways to do it and it's not a straightforward process. Bitcoin Cash just emerged from a hard fork. Doing another could fragment the community again.

When most people think of a state banning Bitcoin, they think of some law making possession or trade illegal.
However, there are much more effective ways to drive a technology to the point of extinction. Do you know anyone who runs a Tor exit node? There's a reason you probably don't, and it has nothing to do with a law on the books.
The IRS doesn't even need to audit every user in Coinbase's (or BitPay's) account file - just a few high-profile "thought leaders." That alone would convince large numbers of users to rethink their use of these services.
Of course, the effort could backfire in a big way. There are many ways to obtain Bitcoin, and in some ways Coinbase has done the community a disservice by making the least private choice so convenient to use. The less convenient but more private options will start to look mighty attractive when you can rest easier knowing you're safe from a frivolous, costly IRS audit.

By 2024 94% of all bitcoin will have been released to circulation:
Although subsidies continue for much longer, they will represent a tiny fraction of the total supply. We're already past 75% distribution.
With only 6% of bitcoin left to be mined, the only viable mechanism to fund security (miners) will be fees.
It's quite annoying to see some dishonest people trot out the year 2140 as the last subsidy payment, then use this as a justification for avoiding the question:
While factually true, subsidy will represent a tiny percentage of miner income by 2140. The effects of subsidy depletion will be felt much earlier and well before most of us are dead.

Chandler talks at some length about Chinese power companies starting to use Bitcoin mining as a "battery" and bitcoin as a tradable "electricity coin." This is a new phenomenon that's only started to take hold in the last year or so.
Filling in the blanks, it appears large mining companies like his and others are under threat of losing access to cheap electricity. The power companies are starting to discover they can profit from the massive excess of electricity they produce by mining themselves. They seek out sources of mining equipment - and buy it for themselves. That creates an adversarial relationship between power companies and standalone miners.
There's a lot to chew on there. China, ground zero for state-sponsored overproduction, is driving all kinds of economic distortion around the world. Previously, that distortion gave birth to the phenomenon of large Chinese miners. Now it appears the distortion is beginning to be seen in the rise of the Chinese power/mining conglomerate.

    private key -&gt; public key -&gt; address
    (number)       (2D point)    (hash value)
the "-&gt;" means one-way flow. You can't go backward.
A public key can generate either a segwit address or a legacy address. They will look different.
The reason is complicated but not important because I think you want to know if you can use either kind of address to check your balance. And the answer is no.
Using a segwit address on a block explorer will only give your balance associated with witness transactions. Checking with a legacy address will only give balance associated with non-witness transactions.

To add to 's answer, keep in mind that spending Bitcoin is a four-step process:
1. Gather unspent outputs (coin ids)
2. Create transactions spending unspent outputs.
3. Add signature to transaction.
4. Broadcast signed transaction on the network.
Notice the the only step requiring a private key is (3), which conveniently doesn't require a network connection. Thats the beauty of public key cryptography. So signing a transaction need not be coupled to network access, except by choice. And it's a choice that you should carefully consider.
You can play around with these concepts using this neat utility (just be sure to practice with chump change only):

It is, but to clear the memory pool backlogs we've seen in the last year will require much more than a 2x or so increase. Even so, we'll only see 2x levels of block space capacity increase when everyone uses segwit.

@_date: 2017-08-24 23:39:13


Like any system, the only way you can optimize your use of it is to understand how it works. Bitcoin penalizes those who want to consume block space needlessly. Spending five coins when you could spend one is an example.
You have options. You can set a lower fee and wait. You can set a low fee and use RBF, then progressively bump fee until confirmation. You can wait to transfer on a weekend, when volumes and fees drop. Most importantly, you can avoid collecting lots of low-valued tokens in the first place.
However, once again, most wallets will work against you on this.

The bare, single donation address (3QzYvaRFY6bakFBW4YBRrzmwzTnfZcaA6E) is interesting from a privacy perspective.
It's open to be sure. The candidate has voluntarily linked a real-world identity with an address. We can monitor donation activity in real-time. For example, the simplest analysis is just to check how much the candidate has collected so far (5 BTC).
Maybe it's too open. All donor pseudonyms will be linked together and associated with the candidate - forever - on the block chain. Should donors use bad privacy practices such that their identities become known, this can be used for political retribution some time down the road. Donors can inadvertently leak privacy by paying with a non-P2SH (starts with "1") and collecting change through another non-P2SH address. And so on.
On the other hand, this donation system can be private. We can all make donations without revealing an identity through a form. There is no third party payment processor to AML/KYC us to Timbuktu and back. And if precautions are taken, we can make it very difficult to link our real world identities with the donation transaction. But that takes skill and the will to preserve privacy.
The problem arises when people think they're donating privately, but their privacy has actually been compromised because of how they use Bitcoin. The more repressive your regime, the more you have to be worried about.
It's a great illustration of the role financial privacy can play, and how Bitcoin changes the rules in unexpected ways.

It appears the OP has misinterpreted a comment by a single developer. Context is important. Read the entire thread:
1. BIP 103 was published in 2015. The canonical source appears to be contained in this Gist: 
2. The linked BIP 103 doesn't actually bear the identification "BIP 103" but rather "BIP ??."
3. Luke-jr considers BIP 103 to be the most reasonable hard fork block size limit increase so far.
4. Somewhat unenthusiastic discussion of BIP 103 from 8 months ago here:  See also: 
5. The roadmap mentions hard forks, but deeply embedded in an answer to a FAQ: "Despite these considerable complications, with sufficient precautions, none of them is fatal to a hard fork, and we do expect to make hard forks in the future."  I see no evidence that the team is actively pursuing this path.
6. The block size limit (and any other parameter requiring a hard fork) can be increased through a soft fork, as described by Peter Todd in early 2016:  The viability of this approach remains to be seen.
In summary, BIP 103 raises the block size limit, but on a schedule that seems too anemic by many observers. It was introduced in 2015 and has essentially sat since then, with little evidence of serious effort to implement or test it. BIP 103 itself says nothing about deployment technique or schedule. Luke-jr considers this proposal the most reasonable block size limit increase so far.

Bitcoin is an electronic cash system. That probably doesn't mean what you think it means. Electronic cash means that when you pay someone with Bitcoin, you're giving them an electronic token with a face value. An electronic coin.
The more coins (tokens) you spend, the more you'll pay in fees.

The part that most beginners miss is that Bitcoin is an *electronic cash system*. I think most people miss this because they consider electronic cash to be some fancy way of saying "electronic payments." It's nothing of the sort. In other words: VISA is not an electronic cash system, it's a payment network.
Electronic cash is a method for replacing physical bank notes with digital tokens. Everything you know about cash, except its materiality, applies to bitcoin. And that exception is where the interesting things begin.
IMO, this article approaches Bitcoin from exactly the wrong angle: as an electronic payment system. Very little about Bitcoin makes sense from this perspective.
However, a lot makes sense when you start with the electronic cash angle.

Transaction is delayed because the market rate for fees is &gt; 80 satoshis/byte:

You can prevent this in the future by ensuring the fee density (satoshis/byte) exceeds the market rate.
Ideally, your wallet should do this for you. If it does and you overrode it, don't do that again. If your wallet hardcodes fees and doesn't let you change them, then ditch it. If your wallet doesn't report the size of your transaction so you can do the fee calculation yourself, find one that will.

If the IRS gets its way, it will be able to associate your legal identity with all of those withdrawal addresses. Not only that, but an entire transaction graph will be available that can show exactly who transacted with who.

First, congratulations to the breadwallet team. This is a big milestone.
For the last several years I've been looking for a wallet that appears to have a mechanism to finance its own development.
The best traditional idea I've found is that the wallet partners with an exchange, and takes a cut of the proceeds. I noticed that breadwallet appears to have taken this route.
Maybe this can be a profitable channel. But even at a lofty cut of 1%, that's going to take $70 million in volume to make $700K in a year. That may cover team salaries and company expenses with a little left over. But it's not going to justify a $7 million+ valuation.
Then there's the non-traditional idea. Treat the investment in the company as a two-pronged attack. On the one side, buy bitcoin and hodl. Profit from price appreciation. On the other, invest in an unprofitable bitcoin startup with technology that improves Bitcoin, but which can't be monetized. When the company fails to perform in the traditional sense, write off the investment as a tax loss, possibly rolling losses over into the future.
As I look around the Bitcoin startup space, this second model seems to dominate. There's lots of investment money going into startups without an obviously viable business model. I'm not saying breadwallet is one of them but as an outside observer the numbers don't seem to add up. Then again, maybe a Bitcoin wallet is like a Web browser: impossible to build a business around by itself but useful to a company that makes its money in other ways.

@_date: 2017-08-22 14:49:50
I really would like to see Bitcoin Cash succeed. But my defintion of success may not match that of others. Bitcoin Cash would be a success in my eyes if it manages to retain the censorship-resistant properties Bitcoin now has while expanding block space. If this were to happen, it would conclusively prove that the theoretical concern that bigger blocks concentrate power were wrong. I would welcome that proof. Without Bitcoin Cash out there pushing that envelope, we're all working on imperfect information.
My concern is that 8 MB blocks on Bitcoin Cash will fill up faster than many are expecting (to the extent they even think this is possible). Supply tends to create demand. And I think a lot of demand for Bitcoin Cash block space will come from people who realize they can now use that block space for things that were previously impractical on Bitcoin. There's a long history of battles fought over this very issue (see, for example the heated/bitter struggles over Namecoin and OP_RETURN).
I have a very simple benchmark. What does it take for me to spin up a full node today? Even with the countless optimizations the Core team has put in place over the years, you see post after post here and elsewhere in which new users who wanted to run a full node realize that their hardware will be chugging for days straight. Another full node that won't be running.
So... when 8 MB blocks are full, then what? Where's the scaling roadmap for Bitcoin Cash? Where's the flurry of developer activity dedicated to optimizing indexing and data storage to deal with 8 MB blocks?

However, the answer to your specific question appears to be no.
Keep in mind that the Bitcoin Core team can only release software and try to convince people to use it. Even if the team dropped a release with a hard fork block size increase to 8 MB tomorrow, it would be up to node operators to adopt it.

Elliptic curves have the property that multiplication of any point by a positive integer gives another point on the curve.
This is similar to the way that integer multiplication always gives another integer. You never get an imaginary number or an irrational number by doing that, for example.
The generator point isn't strictly needed - all that's needed is a valid point on the curve. The generator happens to be a point on the curve and shows the property.
For example, Alice can multiply her private key (A = aG) by Bob's public key (B = bG) to give a new point:
S = aB = a(bG) = abG
Likewise, Bob can multiply his private key by Alice's public key to get the same point:
S = bA = b(aG) = baG = abG
Alice and Bob can now use point S as a shared secret. Even if Eve intercepts communication between Alice and Bob, she can't determine S because she knows neither a nor b.
BTW, this procedure is the basis of Diffie-Hellman exchange using elliptic curves (ECDH).

That probably doesn't mean what you think it means. Bitcoin is not just some fancy way to send money. It's literally a cash system that replaces paper bank notes with electronic tokens.
That means that Bitcoin has a lot in common with the bank notes in your wallet. In fact, bitcoin represents the same idea as those bank notes. You can take one from someone else as payment. You can give one as payment. If the amount of your bank note doesn't match your payment, you'll need to get change, and so on.

Let's see if I understand. This one is subtle.
The change was prompted by the persistent chain split that was caused by non-deterministic behavior of Berkeley DB for pre-0.8 nodes:
To prevent further chain splits, 0.8.1 made any block with more than 4,500 referenced unique transaction IDs invalid. The goal was to prevent nodes from accepting (or generating) blocks that couldn't safely be validated by pre-0.8 peers.
So far, this was just a soft fork. A metric that was previously unbounded became bounded. The range of acceptable behavior was restricted, not expanded. A non-generating pre-0.8.1 node would continue to follow the active chain, provided that the majority of the hash power followed the new rule.
However, 0.8.1 also lifted the transaction ID limit after block 1368576000 (~May 15, 2013). *That* was the hard fork part of the update. A restriction was removed, making otherwise valid blocks with arbitrarily large ID counts valid. A non-generating pre-0.8.0 node that didn't update would be forked off the network by the first miner who generated a block with more than 4,500 unique referenced transaction IDs. This forking would happen non-deterministically, but it would still result in losing the consensus active chain.
The lifting of the transaction ID limit constituted the hard fork part of the 0.8.1 update, right?

At this point, the block size limit may be the least interesting thing about what BitcoinXT is trying to do. The website includes noteworthy points that have nothing to do with the block size limit:
- Unconfirmed transaction rules. An interesting and possibly useful idea, but it's not clear exactly how this will be enforced.
- Support for whatever technical tradeoffs wallet developers wish to explore. Looking forward to seeing what this might entail.
- Decisions are made according to a leadership hierarchy. Gridlock is annoying, but this hierarchy idea sounds like the very problem the OP article claims is stifling Bitcoin.
- Propagate information about double spends across the network. Fast, secure payments would be awesome, but this approach requires a robust fix for point  above.

True. However, it does appear that a nonzero txout length is checked when a block is validated:
This line in CheckTransaction looks for at least one output:
    if (tx.vout.empty())
        return state.DoS(10, error("CheckTransaction(): vout empty"),
                         REJECT_INVALID, "bad-txns-vout-empty");
And this line in CheckBlock runs the check when validating a block:
    BOOST_FOREACH(const CTransaction&amp; tx, block.vtx)
        if (!CheckTransaction(tx, state))
            return error("CheckBlock(): CheckTransaction failed");

Offline signing on an Electum single sig setup should solve all of your problems except something happening to you.
You can, however backup using Shamirs Secret Sharing. Here's an implementation you can play with online or offline:
Create a 2-of-3 share, and give each parent a share, and keep one for yourself. Or just make a 2-of-2. If you're unable to sign, they can put their shares together to regenerate the seed mnemonic and spend the savings.
The problem is accounting for one of your parents keys being lost. You could involve a third party, such as an attorney or trustee in that case. Give him/her one of 3 shares.
The problem of a burgelar can be solved by either keeping the mnemonic sentence offsite or memorized so that there is nothing to steal.
Regardless of what you do, consider keeping an unencrypted backup in a very secure location. You're more likely to lock yourself out than be attacked.

My working definition of an altcoin is:


By this definition, an upward adjustment to the block size limit would give rise to an altcoin. I see no reason to distinguish altcoins that share a common block size heritage with Bitcoin. It just complicates an already complicated situation.
It should be noted that an upward revision to the 21M cap creates exactly the same situation - an altcoin that shares a common block chain heritage with Bitcoin.
Many (most?) proponents of a block size limit increase have downplayed or completely ignored the risks of splitting the network. Using the term "altcoin" is both technically correct and puts the issue of a network split where it belongs - center stage.
Regardless of what we decide to call this situation, the problem remains. Increasing the block size limit is not the risk-free option many are making it out to be.

Same as with Bitcoin Core - anyone. You can fork XT if you don't like how things are going.
The question is, who will follow you?

This is an oversimplification. When a hard fork update is deployed, it creates two versions of consensus. In effect, you can be a large-blockist *and* a small-blockist at the same time if you choose.
I see too many analyses of the block size limit issue that ignore the fact that an upward adjustment effectively creates an altcoin. That new altcoin needs new users or it will die. Those new users will be drawn from the pool of existing Bitcoin users.
This places the block size limit issue squarely in the domain of politics, which is the single best reason I know of to avoid hard forks in the first place.
Engineering considerations do play a role in the block size issue, but many of the questions being asked have no unambiguous answers.
Given these factors, it should be no surprise that the issue has taken on its current character.

I don't think it can be explained to someone trying to avoid learning new things. But I think it can be explained to someone trying to learn.
The process boils down to:
1. Download an application that can validate signatures. This will usually be some variety of GPG or PGP.
2. Download Electrum and the corresponding signature file (.asc) into the same directory.
3. Import the developer public key - ThomasV for sources and Animazing for binaries.
4. Validate Electrum's signature.

The online and offline wallets are linked through math. The offline wallet never knows how many key pairs you've used, but the online wallet does because it can read the block chain.
It sounds like the offline wallet hadn't iterated far enough through the key pool to see all of the private keys you've actually used.
In other words, what you saw was about what I expect.
If your plan is to simply dump private keys from Armory, though, that could be a problem. You'll have to make sure to dump those that the offline wallet might not be showing you.
That said, I would consider moving funds with a transaction from Armory. Is there a reason this wouldn't work?

This is plausible. Alternatively, coinbase could be reusing addresses and the merchant messed up the price. Why not this possibility instead?

You'll need two notifications:
1. That a transaction paying you has entered the memory pool.
2. That a transaction paying you has entered the block chain.
You can do both with Bitcoin Core, but not easily.
Bitcoin Core supports an JSON-RPC interface:
Using bitcoin-cli, you can use JSON-RPC to get an array of all transaction IDs:
    $ bitcoin-cli getrawmempool
You can decode a memory pool transaction with:
    $ bitcoin-cli getrawtransaction &lt;id&gt; 1
where &lt;id&gt; is the transaction ID (the 1 indicates verbose, parsed output). The output will be JSON that encodes outputs, from which you can read payment addresses and amounts.
Core can notify you when a new block is received using blocknotify:
Or you can poll for new blocks. Either way, you can read the ID of the tip with:
    $ bitcoin-cli getbestblockhash
This returns a block ID. Using this ID, you can read its transactions:
    $ bitcoin-cli getblock &lt;id&gt;
where &lt;id&gt; is the block ID. The returned JSON object contains an array of transaction IDs stored in the "tx" property. Using this array, you can iterate over each transaction ID, looking for an output that pays you.
To read confirmed transactions by ID, you'll need to enable txindex:
After enabling txindex (and possibly using the -reindex startup flag if running headless, or agreeing to reindex if running the GUI), you'll be able to use getrawtransaction to read confirmed transactions the same way as you did with unconfirmed transactions.
From the tip, you can read backward to the parent block using the previousblockhash property. Keep scanning backward until you get tired or find a transaction paying you.
As points out, you can import addresses in a watch-only sense, but that takes about 10 minutes for each one on my system and IMO simply isn't practical.

2. Use child-pays-for-parent: 
Here's an in-depth explanation about what's going on:
@_date: 2015-08-18 19:55:51


Maybe, but it could have the opposite effect.
The cost of filling a block is a function of two parameters: block size and transaction fee density. The latter is dynamic when block size can't accommodate demand. The higher the market fee density, the more it costs to fill a block.
We saw fees rise sharply during the last attacks. That raises the costs for users, but also spammers. The harder spammers push, the more expensive the attack becomes. Effectively, the spammer is able to raise transaction fees temporarily, but not shut the network down.
This assumes some sensible fix to the problem of a node running out of RAM to host the memory pool. But that's much easier than a hard fork. I suspect the solution will take the form of simply blocking/dropping transactions that pay a sub-market fee density. In other words, the relay fee would start to float in conjunction with the miner fee. If the spammer wants to continue to play, he must pay.
With no pushback from a low block size limit, a spammer such as CoinWallet can fill blocks for days on end with a known, fixed cost. With constrained blocks, the spammer will have to factor in the escalation of fees due to competition.
The cost to flood a network running 1 MB blocks could easily surpass the cost to flood a network running 8 MB blocks.
Either way, users who care about their money would be wise to consider the trustworthiness of a service operator willing to perform such an attack rather than engage directly.
edit: added stuff
@_date: 2017-11-17 15:17:21
Was the transaction marked as replaceable? Electrum does this by default if you pay a low fee.
If so, you can bump the fee using replace-by-fee (RBF).
@_date: 2015-08-14 20:35:56
Part of this is easy to understand. A private key is just a number:
Let's say you choose 5 as your private key. You can create a practically infinite set of key pairs with a simple rule:
    new private key = 5 + offset
where offset is a number such as 1,2,3, etc. when you need a new private key, you just add one to the last offset you used, and add the offset to 5. When you need a new public key, you generate it from the new private key. This is called *private derivation*.
In this case, your master private key would be the number 5.
This is not such a good system for a few reasons, but it illustrates the basic math.
Understanding how a master public key works is a bit tricker. But the basic idea is that you can generate public keys from the master public key in much the same way as you generated private keys. Except you don't actually need private keys to do it. This is public derivation, and requires some understanding of how elliptic curve math works.

I wouldn't say the policy of banning discussions of XT is wrong - just counterproductive.
For one thing, the result has been a textbook case of the Streisand Effect:
If the goal is to prevent this sub from promoting XT, then it has failed. XT is all anyone is talking about, largely because the policy seems counterintuitive and unfair to so many.
Regarding consensus, it's a process - not an endpoint. If you ban discussion of the only actual implementation of big blocks that's ready to be run by end users, how will that help bring about consensus on the scalability issue?
I'd suggest that banning XT discussions will do the opposite by driving a wedge through the community. Not only will it be divided on the abstract idea of scalability, but will become cut off from the very user group than can best inform the ongoing scalability discussion. XT users believe that increasing the block size is the answer, and they're the ones willing to set up nodes to support the idea. They'll get to see first hand where that idea leads.
I'll give you an example. Today a user posted a question about syncing a new XT node. It was taking much longer than s/he expected. I responded by saying that Bitcoin Core itself takes up to 12 hours to sync from scratch for me, and that this was firsthand evidence of the problems scalability issues can cause. Imagine the tenor of that discussion, and countless others like it that will take place, after six months of big blocks. Maybe things will work out swimmingly for XT, in which case some of the small blockists would need to reconsider their positions. Or, it could go quite badly, in which case many XT faithful would be the ones wondering if they made the wrong call.
Regardless of the outcome, when those kinds of discussions stop happening because users who want to experiment with XT are forced out, it's wasting an opportunity to actually exchange information and move the scalability debate forward.
About the altcoin issue. I agree with your position that any hard fork update creates an altcoin, and have written as much several times. This is not a value judgement, just a matter of technical accuracy. But it doesn't matter.
What matters is discouraging spam and promoting worthwhile discussion, which can be a tough balancing act. I generally don't like memes, but some of them are outstanding. Memes are ok on but if you make a bad one, nobody will even see it because it will get downvoted to oblivion.
The thing about XT posts is that some will be spam, but some will be very useful. Is it really worth throwing the baby out with the bath water on this one?

When you accept a payment, you're accepting a digital token. It's like a metal coin in that it can be exchanged, but it's made of bits rather than atoms.
One way a digital token differs from a metal coin is *chain of ownership*. That means you can trace the history of previous owners back to a block subsidy payment. The chain of ownership is really a chain of transactions, each of which references a previous transaction. The last user on the chain owns the coin.
It's a little like the way provenance works in art. You can see the previous owners of a work back to the original artist. That provenance makes the work more valuable.
Arbitrarily throwing out blocks would lead to broken chains of ownership. Suddenly, many coin owners couldn't demonstrate an unbroken chain of ownership.
That said, there is a way to remove unneeded transactions called "pruning." Pruning eliminates previous transactions in a chain of ownership after it's been assembled and validated. The effect is to remove some, but not all of the transactions in a given block.
The price of pruning is interoperability. A node that prunes can't show another node the full chain of ownership, making synchronization more difficult if widely implemented across the network.

Bitcoin is an electronic cash system. That term is much more important than it may seem, and it's worth understanding:
When you create a transaction, you're spending one or more digital tokens, which the transaction represents as inputs. Each input consumes about 150 bytes if your public keys are compressed.
Inputs are the single biggest contributor to transaction length. The more of them you use, the more you'll pay in fees. But the fee density you pay should be the same unless you change it.

First, the term "public address" is redundant. They're just called "addresses."


That's true.
Addresses add features you don't get with a public key.
For starters, there is a checksum built into every address. Mistype or transpose a character, and it can be detected - before you (or your payer) send money down a hole.
Second, addresses avoid characters that are easily confused with each other through compact base 58 encoding. Hex doesn't have this problem, but results in very long representations.
Also, giving a hash of your public key offers a security advantage. If elliptic curve cryptography starts to succcumb to attacks in which a private key can be extracted from a public key (discrete log problem), using a public key hash forces the attacker to perform yet another difficult step of generating the public key from the hash. The added security only applies if you haven't reused  addresses. Spending from an address publishes the corresponding public key to the block chain.
Some have speculated that Satoshi didn't know about public key compression at the time addresses were created. Uncompressed public keys are 65 bytes long, whereas the hash value Bitcoin uses is only 20 bytes long. From that perspective, using a hash leads to a more compact identifier. A compressed public key is 33 bytes long.

The second output via the 1F address has a value that's too low. The name for this kind of output is "dust", the limit for which is 546 satoshis. Your output is 10 satoshis.
Your wallet created a transaction containing dust that nodes will refuse to relay, and which most miners will refuse to confirm.
Don't attempt to send again from the same wallet. The tx will eventually be dropped from bc.i, as it has already been from Blockr:

That's an interesting idea. Imagine a majority cartel introduces a block size cap of 500KB. Also imagine that many nodes update to support the new limit. This creates, in effect a soft fork, no?
When the majority cartel falls out of powers, doesn't lifting the cap back to 1MB constitute a hard fork?
Essentially that's where we're at now with the block size limit, isn't it?
Satoshi introduced the limit as a soft fork. Raising the limit now requires a hard fork because essentially all nodes have followed the new, more restrictive rule.

An interesting variation on this search technique would be to reverse the hashes used as private keys. Bitcoin uses  little endian notation for transaction IDs and (IIRC) Merkle roots.

Two things you can do to protect your privacy:
1. Avoid linking online identities (reddit username, twitter handle, etc.) with addresses.
2. Don't reuse addresses.

Great work!
The main differences I noted in the UI:
1. You can select the units of fee density that will be displayed (e.g., satoshis/byte instead of mBTC/KB);
2. Native bech32 segwit addresses.
That last one may be just one item, but it's a doozy. Two different kinds of wallet seeds are supported:
- Standard; and
- Segwit (start with "bc1")
I haven't worked with Electrum 3 enough to know whether a Segwit seed will produce a wallet capable of generating both legacy and segwit addresses.
Before using native segwit addresses, here's something to consider:

It seems highly unlikely that a government would give up the right to have any say in the money supply. At first I thought the idea of Bitcoin being adopted as an official state currency seemed very unlikely for this reason.
Nevertheless, a handful of countries use the U.S. Dollar either exclusively or in parallel with local currency.
There are other reasons Bitcoin might not be adopted as a state currency, but apparently the inability to manipulate it may not be one of them.

Fee density is the relevant metric - fee in satoshis/size in bytes. You can use Tradeblock to see it, for example (Fee/size):
Number of addresses isn't relevant and can be misleading.
The fee density for your spending transactions made through Electrum should be consistent. It should match the value you set under preferences/transaction fee per kb. Be sure to do the unit conversion to satoshis/byte. In other words, multiply the number Electrum gives by 100.
What do you see?

There are two main selfish advantages:
1. Processing payments through your own full node gives you the opportunity for the best security. You're talking directly to other peers on the network, not a third party. You're using the full block chain and the security model described in the white paper.
2. You get better privacy. Asking a third party about your transaction history allows it to reconstruct that history and use the information against you in various ways. When you have the entire block chain on your own hard drive, you need to ask for, and therefore reveal, nothing.
Note that these selfish advantages don't kick in unless your wallet or whatever system for making/accepting payments uses the full node you're running.

The design goal in Bitcoin was to keep the block interval long enough that the risk of persistent chain forks was practically zero. Shortening the block interval can decrease security by increasing the odds of a persistent chain split.
It isn't a limitation of the proof-of-work algorithm. It's a design feature built into Bitcoin. Think of the block interval as a fundamental security parameter enforced by difficulty adjustment.
Altcoins may be experimenting with shorter times and ways to promote consensus under those conditions, but it's not a direction Bitcoin will be taking because the payoff doesn't justify the security risk at the moment.
Maybe one of those alts will show us all that it's actually safe. Given enough support, block interval can be shortened while adjusting the subsidy schedule. Until then, there are many alts to choose from with short block times...

Although it was hotly debated, P2SH was a backward compatible soft fork.
The March 2013 chain split was due to nondeterministic behavior of pre-0.8 nodes. The fix invalidated the existing nondeterministic behavior, resulting in a soft fork.

Lowering the block interval increases the probability that two blocks will be in transit at the same time on the network. That creates a chain split that must be resolved if double spending is to be reliably detected.
The split can only be resolved by the generation of a new block building on one chain or the other. But if this block also has a sibling in transit at the same time (because the block interval is too short), then both chains grow together and the split is merely extended, not resolved.

Unlike the supply of gold, the supply of Bitcoin can be increased if enough people want it to happen. Just like the block size can be raised if enough people want that to happen.
The 21 million cap is nothing but 11 lines of code including white space and comments:
Yes, it's based on math, but it's software. FWIW, the block subsidy has already been changed in a pretty radical way:
That change didn't cause a chain split because the effects are decades away.
Regarding what could motivate a large number of Bitcoin users to change the subsidy, it would come down to survival. Bitcoin is currently funding all of its network security through monetary expansion. As the rate of expansion decreases to 6.25 btc per block by 2020, that could start to make various economic attacks more profitable than mining. For example, double spending (confirmed) transactions as a service.

Yes. Sighash flags are independent of the type of script being used.
SIGHASH_NONE leaves all outputs unsigned. You're basically writing a blank check. This is only a good idea if you plan on just giving the money away.
As for how you'd go about doing this, I it may be possible with the Bitcoin Core console. Alternatively, use a developer tool like bcash.
@_date: 2015-08-18 02:37:08
If you haven't run Bitcoin Core, you might give it a try. The block chain is only 40 GB, but that's only part of the problem. Validating that quantity of transactions takes many hours. Only through heroic optimization effort has the Core team managed to keep the software from grinding to a halt.
The size of the block chain is doubling roughly every year. And as it grows, the time and resources it takes to keep up escalate.
It used to be quite easy to set up a full node on a $5/month server. Now, you really need to look around to find a plan that can accommodate the horsepower that a node demands.
But it gets worse. As block capacity increases, so do the number of transactions zipping around the network, putting pressures on bandwidth.
The fear is that before long, it won't even be viable for the average hobbyist to run a full node. It already happened long ago with mining. Today, a majority of hash rate is controlled by fewer than five entities.
 Fewer people running nodes means even further concentration of decision making, and less censorship resistance.
Scalability is a hard problem in Bitcoin. It's always paired with centralization on the flip side.

These are some observations I made:
- The P2P network can withstand transaction volume that greatly exceeds confirmation capacity for days on end.
- Using a competitive fee density will lead to next-block confirmation.
- Many wallets don't take either of the first two points into account.
- Cointape (which is now offline, hopefully temporarily) is a useful tool for checking market conditions when confirmation time matters. 
- Replace-by-fee can clear transactions stuck by low fees: 
- Electrum and Mycelium servers appear to behave poorly during times of high transaction volume.

A block using the new hardfork rule will be rejected by an unpatched node.


No. The extent of validation unpatched nodes can perform depends on the type of soft fork.
For example, when Satoshi released the update imposing the 1 MB block size limit (a soft fork), unpatched nodes continued full validation of every transaction and every block. Other kinds of soft forks, such as P2SH, changed the validation rules in such a way that unpatched nodes only knew some of them. So the nature of the soft fork determines how much validation unpatched nodes can do.


It depends on the update. Lowering the block size limit, for example, changed the rules of validation in a way that lets non-generating nodes continue following the active chain.


I'm not sure I understand the example. Consensus bugs, whether introduced through a soft fork or hard fork update, are harmful to Bitcoin.

"Cold storage" is the term to research. Here's an intro:


If you've used git, then you've already used something like what most people think about when they say "blockchain." There's not much new about a chain of hashes. But it's the way these hashes are used and the economic incentives that have been created that makes Bitcoin the innovation that it is.
The bigger idea here is censorship-resistant money. Bitcoin transactions can't be blocked, regardless of who makes them or how loathsome the purpose. That's a novel idea in electronic payments, and part of what makes Bitcoin such a dangerous and fascinating innovation.


If you hold your funds on an exchange, all you own is a promise from the exchange to pay you in bitcoin.

They'd get a transparent, permissioned, tamper evident asset registry. The permissioned part means that although everybody could read the blockchain, only authorized parties could write to it (generate blocks).
If you think about it, the Bitcoin block chain itself is is a permissioned ledger in the sense that you need to build and maintain a data center to write to it. Take this one step further and force the miner to register with Nasdaq and sign every block, and this could be where things are headed.
The reason to use something like this instead of a spreadsheet is that you can't use a spreadsheet to produce distributed consensus.

A miner adds a special transaction, the coinbase transaction, to every block he mines. The coinbase transaction, unlike other transactions, has no input in the regular sense - just outputs. Part of the funding comes from the block subsidy (25btc), and the rest comes from the combined transaction fees in the rest of the block. So the coinbase transaction is quite an oddball that can create new money and route money through transaction fees.
If a proof-of-work is found for the block, and the miner succeeds in getting it accepted, the coinbase transaction becomes confirmed. Its output can then be spent like any other transaction (after a waiting period due to technical reasons).

Bitcoin Core doesn't leak privacy in the same way that SPV wallets do because Bitcoin core downloads *all* transactions. On your computer, Core decides which transactions it's interested in.
Regarding the broadcast of transactions, that where Tor could possibly come in. A highly connected node that was also your peer could deduce that your node was the source of a published transaction, possibly linking your IP address with Bitcoin addresses.
In practice, I've never seen this attack proven successful.
Tor exposes Core to some nasty attacks:
One alternative would be to publish the transaction as a separate step. For example, push it through Insight. Doing so while running Tor would further obfuscate your IP:

The article makes the case that intervention was the "right answer" and demonstrates why "strong central leadership" is important to Bitcoin. I'm not so sure.
The outcome is clear: the longest chain lost, contradicting one of Bitcoin's most deeply-engrained principles. The cost of breaking this rule may come in the form of reduced censorship-resistance at some point in the future, a point the article doesn't account for.
The article doesn't really talk about what caused the split in the first place. This is important, because it's one way to arrive at the "right answer."
BIP 50 describes the problem in a nutshell:


In other words, pre-0.8 nodes had a bug that caused them to generate blocks that other pre-0.8 nodes couldn't validate. The 0.8 update wasn't the cause.
In comments buried on a thread from many months ago, Peter Todd and Greg Maxwell confirmed that the behavior was non-deterministic:






If I'm reading this all correctly, the "right answer" was to lead users who were running software without a bug to begin running software with that bug. Not only that, but to kill the longest chain in the process through an out-of-band channel. It's clear that those involved acted in good faith, but may not have fully understood the root cause.
With these points in mind, the author's claim that the "right answer" was implemented seems harder to judge. If the pre-0.8 chain split behavior was really non-deterministic, it seems plausible that the shorter branch would have lost support on its own - without any intervention, as Vitalik suggests.

A colored coin is a regular coin with a "watermark" that distinguishes it from other coins on the block chain.
Two concepts are key to understanding colored coins: electronic cash and OP_RETURN:
A stock exchange can use colored coins to record asset ownership on the block chain by declaring that a coin bearing a given watermark represents a share (or shares) in a company.
An OP_RETURN output is exempt from the dust rule and can even have a nominal value of zero.

Beyond the ongoing security problems, the BIP 66 rollout highlights a few issues:
1. When latent updates go live, unexpected things can happen.
2. A block chain "vote" doesn't necessarily mean anything about future miner behavior.
3. This update (BIP 66) wasn't hotly debated, nor was it even a hard fork.
4. Light wallets (SPV and otherwise) are quite a bit less secure than they might appear on the surface. They are at high risk during chain splits.
5. A large fraction of the network hash rate concluded that blocks were already too large to use them when mining, and that a questionable optimization would be profitable.
6. When a chain split occurs, it's very difficult to communicate what users should do.

Not only is decentralization inefficicient, but Bitcoin's design makes it very difficult to even measure the extent of the centralization that's already occurred. Mining statistics are self-reported and trivially gamed. Large miners are motivated to lie about the true size of their operations.
Bitcoin's incentives favor mining centralization.
However, it's hard to maintain a monopoly on a truly open platform. The rise and fall of large mining operations over the last few years offers some support for this idea.

To define "altcoin", we need to define "Bitcoin". That's not easy to do.
If you consider Bitcoin to be a protocol rather than a computer program, then applying the label "altcoin" to the big blocks update makes sense. The update would create a new cryptocurrency incompatible with the rules that created the block chain we have right now.
If you consider Bitcoin to be a computer program, however, describing the big blocks update as an "altcoin" seems out-of-place. But this definition creates many problems. What about developer branches? What about release candidates? What about alternative implementations such as btcd and libbitcoin? It also leads to centralization: s/he who controls the GitHub repository and/or bitcoin.org page controls Bitcoin.

What did you plan on doing with them? A paper wallet is generally used to store bitcoin that have been obtained elsewhere. A private key is a long string of text and should be printed on the paper wallet, and typically begins with a "5", "K", or "L". It will begin with a "6" if encrypted.

Connecting the dots, here's one way that could happen:
1. Blocks fill up. Every block is nearly 1 MB in length.
2. There's not enough space in every block for all of the transactions in the memory pool.
3. Transactions skimping on fees are regularly dropped, but on an unpredictable schedule.
4. Users become frustrated with Bitcoin because there's no good way for miners to communicate what fee will be acceptable. It's not about being a cheapskate, it's about lack of marketplace feedback.
5. Users demand replace-by-fee to regain control over their "stuck" transactions.
Even in the absence of fee pressure, stuck transactions are a major usability problem, and have been for years.

Flavien's response made it sound like he wasn't involved in the implementation. The answer I heard sounded like a deduction rather than a statement of fact:

- therefore Nasdaq will be using the Bitcoin block chain

- posting "your Bitcoin address" on Twitter

That perspective is largely a product of current conditions. Perpetual 50 BTC block reward grows the money supply indefinitely, eroding buying power along the way. The network is secure, so nobody wants to create new money unnecessarily.
But... it's not hard to imagine future conditions in which a perpetual 50 BTC block subsidy would be demanded by large numbers of users.
For example, the subsidy may drop to such a low level that it becomes more profitable to attack the network than to mine blocks honestly. In this scenario, fees and exchange rate increases fail to make up the lost mining revenue. Honest miners leave in droves. This situation would likely lead to a split in the community between those favoring a robust inflation schedule vs. those wanting to stick to the original "vision."
Not unlike the ongoing big block/small block discussion.

This system is (apparently) being built on top of the Bitcoin block chain using the Open Assets protocol, which is itself based on Colored Coins:


Private Market is Nasdaq's exchange that trades pre-IPO company shares:
One of the advantages of Open Assets is something called "atomic" asset transfers. This allows the owner of a Colored Coin (i.e., a share in a pre-IPO company) to exchange it for bitcoin in a single Bitcoin transaction.
This is a fundamentally new way to trade shares electronically because it solves the "who goes first" problem without the need for a central operator. Two strangers can trade securely and remotely, without the need for the exchange to act as an escrow service. The exchange simply provides a marketplace, which can in principle be bypassed. Barter-type arrangements (share-for-share) are also possible.
There's not a whole lot of documentation on this, but here's an early technical discussion on the idea:
Edit: added the word "apparently" because it's still not clear whether or not Nasdaq will be using a "private" block chain or the actual Bitcoin block chain. A private block chain may allow barter-type transactions but not share-for-bitcoin trades.

The behavior is undefined.
Currently, the only way to clear a transaction from a node's memory pool is to shut it down, mine a block with the transaction in it, or through manual intervention of some kind. The node might also implement its own memory pool cleaning routine.
A long-running, unattended, stock node can keep a transaction in its memory pool indefinitely. If that happens on enough nodes, the transaction can appear to remain unconfirmed permanently. It's very hard to know if this will be the case or not for a given transaction.

When faced with what appears certain disaster, money printing is often sought as a way out. Nothing gives Bitcoin a free pass on this. The process of lifting the 21 M cap may be very different from printing money, but the path to do so could follow a very similar trajectory.
Some will claim that this can never happen, that any change to the cap isn't Bitcoin anymore. That the 21 M cap is protected by math, and so on.
Like many hard coded parameters in Bitcoin, the money supply can be changed through a hard fork.
This is the main reason to view any hard fork with a great deal of caution. There have been proposals to hard fork Bitcoin on a regular basis. Under a regime like that the urge to tinker with the cap at some point would become almost irresistible.

That's something you should answer before committing funds to the device. I would find a method that looks good and practice it with only a small amount of money at risk. When you know the drill backward and forward, only then commit your savings.

Both the Newsnight explanation and the one Frisby offers use words that people understand (with the possible exception of "DNA"). Language is not the problem.
The problem with both explanations is the starting point. Starting with the block chain is just as bad as starting with mining. Neither make much sense in isolation.
Bitcoin is an *electronic cash system*. Under this system, users exchange digital tokens just like they would exchange bank notes and metal coins. Everything follows from this simple, but deep, idea. Yet commentators of all stripes seem hell-bent on avoiding it.
The universal problem with electronic cash systems is double spending. A fraudster can trick two users into accepting the same digital token as payment.
Systems before Bitcoin took the easy way out, adding a central operator (the "mint"). Then the predicable happened: the mint failed or was shut down.
Seeing these failures, Bitcoin's creator took a radically different approach that replaced the central operator with a network of operators that didn't need to trust each other.
The block chain is the tool these operators use to collectively prevent double spending.

Having a centralized anything in Bitcoin makes me uncomfortable. A centralized status page means that the machine serving the page gets elevated to special status. Wallets may begin to treat the page as a trusted API. It means that those maintaining the page receive elevated status. It means that authorities looking for a choke point have something to grab onto.
In other words, it's the road leading to the bad part of town. At least it seems that way.

The main advantage is Copay's security model, which allows you to distribute spending authority over multiple devices.
The downside is that all data flow through a centralized server. On the bright side, it's open source and the wallet lets you specify your own server.
Armory and Electrum shine for cold storage because they allow you to perform offline transactions. This is a complementary security model to the one Copay uses.
Copay can also be used as a single-signature hot wallet. As such, it's pretty good.

I disagree in that the information a user gives up to a payer or payee is largely a personal choice. Bitcoin can be purchased privately with cash and though other methods that don't require AML/KYC interrogation. Bitcoin can also be earned through sale of goods and services.

You're right. Most people in western countries can use powerful financial systems at will to do ordinary things with money.

Bitcoin's main selling point is censorship-resistance. That covers a lot of ground - it's about far more than enabling legally gray activities.

Paper wallets are very good for one thing: teaching you how Bitcoin works.
It sounds like you may be new to cold storage/Bitcoin. You might want to think about limiting your bitcoin trades to trivial amounts that can be safely lost altogether. The section titled ("A Cautionary Tale") in this link may be worth reading:
Before committing a significant amount of money to a Trezor I would do the following:
1. Set up the Trezor as per the instructions.
2. Add a buck or two worth of bitcoin.
3. Reset the Trezor, completely wiping the wallet.
4. Imagine that your Trezor has been lost in a fire.
5. Use a third-party tool to recover your funds, sweeping them into a paper wallet.
If you can do these things and understand what you're doing, only then would I move on to funding the Trezor with larger amounts.

There's a rule of thumb to only consider high value payments final after six confirmations. That rule still applies, but only if you're running an up-to-date copy of Bitcoin Core. If not, then the six confirmation rule no longer applies. A more stringent rule does.
If you receive a payment and you're not using Bitcoin Core, or don't know what that is, then you'll want to wait a lot more than 6 confirmations for high value payments. 30 is the guideline, but it's just a way of saying, wait as long as you possibly can before considering a big payment final.
If you're not sending or receiving payments, there's no need to do anything different.

Bitcoin use may be growing in Argentina, but it has a minuscule base, despite an ongoing economic crisis for the past several years, and despite Argentina being "a country where still only half the population entrust their money to the formal banking system" no less.

Not many people were talking about governance before the last big push on the block size limit hard fork. I'm not sure the heightened interest is a good thing for Bitcoin.
Hard forks are by their nature political. The hard forker proposes to create an altcoin that shares a common block chain lineage with Bitcoin. This is not a value judgement, just a statement of technical fact. Nodes that don't go along with the idea stay on the current network, while those who do join a new network. This has never happened in Bitcoin's history. It's not any old update, although it has unfortunately been portrayed as such.
For the most part, the users of the new altcoin must come from the Bitcoin user pool. This is the very definition of a political process, and the negative aspects should surprise nobody: appeal to authority; "us against them" discussions; and hominem attacks. Basically, the underbelly of the political process.
The block size limit is a particularly bad issue around which to gather a user base because the most important technical questions have few good answers.
I think it would be interesting to get Gavin's vision for what happens after the big blocks update goes live in XT. What happens if a substantial segment of Bitcoin's user base stays with small blocks? What would be the criteria for pulling the plug on the XT experiment? How will users feel about essentially two Bitcoins, each one claiming to be the real deal? How would the press and fintech sector react to such a split? How would all of this affect Bitcoin's long term prospects for "mass adoption?"
If Gavin feels that such a gloomy possibility is out of the question, why does he think that? I'd be interested in knowing which evidence most convincingly supports the idea it won't happen, and why he feels that splitting the Bitcoin network is an acceptable risk for getting bigger blocks right now.
BTW, epicenter has been doing some excellent interviews. Looking forward to this one.

@_date: 2015-07-01 14:25:16
From the first sentence (my emphasis):


The same assertion is made later:


I disagree. As anyone who has used Blockchain.info knows, Bitcoin transactions are not private in the slightest - they occur in full public view, and are effectively stored forever. Bitcoin depends on every transaction being public for the foreseeable future - it's just how the technology works.
The article pits the kind of digital money favored by governments and corporations against systems like Bitcoin:


Privacy in Bitcoin is not something you're given by default. It's something you have to grab with both hands and bend to your will. That means being very familiar with Bitcoin's inner workings, and not making mistakes - ever. It's a bar few will be able to meet, unless far better privacy tools are built into wallets by default.
The article paints a simplistic view of Bitcoin privacy that I'm afraid will mislead very many newcomers.
Privacy in Bitcoin is based on pseudonymity, a very nuanced model with many unexplored nooks and crannies. It's a form of privacy that, when applied to money, will be foreign to most people. There's really nothing in common experience to compare it to.
Bitcoin could easily lead to the very dystopia Andreas warns against. Not through evil governments, but by ordinary people trying to use a system that's beyond their ability to comprehend, and doing so with tools that assume expert knowledge, or which flat out do the wrong thing.
I'm all for making things as simple as possible, but I draw the line at making them simpler.

A bitcoin is composed of 100,000,000 satoshis. Satoshis can't currently be subdivided. That can change though a protocol update, but if you tried to create a transaction today using fractional satoshis, the network would reject it.
This is not unlike the bottle of wine and its molecules. For most practical purposes, the bottle of wine and a bitcoin are infinitely divisible.
The point, however, is that the act of dividing the bottle of wine does not create value out of thin air. The same is true of dividing a bitcoin.

Yes, that is a privacy leak.


Ledger has received a lot of good reviews, but to my knowledge has not received an independent security audit.
The name of the game in Bitcoin security is to ensure two things:
1. You will always have access to your private keys.
2. Nobody else will ever have access to your private keys.
What makes (1) easier will make (2) easier as well. That's the tradeoff.
If it's not clear how best to accomplish (1) and (2), it might be a good idea to avoid holding bitcoin until that gets sorted out.
Having worked through dozens (hundreds?) of panicked posts on reddit over the last couple years (I've made it my mission to do that), I can say there are few things worse in Bitcoin than realizing you've locked yourself out of your own money, or that you've carelessly given your private keys away.

Under a specific set of conditions, that is true. However, I'm thinking more along the lines that Bitcoin could face an existential threat that involves deciding between expanding the money supply or extinction.
Consider what would happen if transaction fees don't compensate for cuts to the block subsidy enough to keep the network secure. Maybe after the 2020 halving, for example.
The only thing keeping many miners from becoming double spending services is that it's currently more profitable to mine than to steal. That doesn't always need to be true, however.
You would be faced with a choice. Stick to your fixed supply guns or agree to a little money expansion. Which do you choose?

Well done overall. I like the humor in places (Robocoin - bring lube).
The main problem that comes to mind is how much information this deck covers. I'd focus on ways to pare it down - drastically.
What's the main problem this audience faces that Bitcoin can solve?
Is it getting paid or is it placing a BP ad? If it's the latter, then I'd focus only on that topic. In that case, I think you can cut this to 10, maybe 15 slides at the most.
Still assuming that the main problem is BP ads, I would recommend either BitQuick or Localbitcoins as the method for buying bitcoin. The former can be used without even creating an online account. Both allow orders to be paid for with cash at a bank teller. Neither service requires a bank account. In both cases, amounts as little as $5-20 can be traded.

My best advice would be that your first purchase should only be a few buck's worth so you can learn and make mistakes. That way you'll feel free to take risks without a downside. If you've bought more than a few buck's worth, you might want to convert most of it back to fiat and hold that until you're up to speed.
If you can effortlessly move a tiny amount of bitcoin onto a paper wallet and back, you're on the right track. If you can do it through offline signing, you're in really good shape.

The name of thing you're thinking of is "hash function." That's what usually turns a phrase into a brain wallet. 
I haven't found any really good explanations of how hash functions work, but there are quite a few so-so explanations. Hash functions are everywhere in Bitcoin, so if you want to understand it on a deeper level, hash functions are a good concept to grok.
The bottom line is that SHA-256, the hash function used to make most brain wallets, has been demonstrated by experience to give output that's indistinguishable from random. That's a good thing.

A miner controlling 35% of the hash power controls at least 35% of the theoretical block chain capacity. Taking that capacity offline for transactions that don't pay the minimum fee raises fee pressure on every user, regardless of what the rest of the miners do.
Under this scenario, one out of every three blocks on average would require a higher minimum fee. Sometimes those blocks will be sequentially arranged. I know that if I don't pay what the miner is asking for, confirmation of my transaction could be delayed. No?

Doing so makes it very easy to link all of your incoming and outgoing payments together. Then those linked payments stay on a public ledger for the foreseeable future.
If that idea doesn't bother you (and it doesn't bother many people), then reusing your address might be ok.
However, if the software you use happens to have a bad random number generator for generating signatures, that can result in your funds being stolen without the thief ever logging into your computer or knowing you by name.

The best way to prevent this is to stop re-using paper wallets. Receive one payment and hold it. When you spend it, don't ever use the paper wallet again.

If Alice re-uses [address], even worse things can happen. Every transaction Alice makes, Coinbase knows about it. Time of day. Frequency, amount. Any payment Alice receives, Coinbase knows about it. If those payments are coming (in)directly from Coinbase accounts, Coinbase can link those other Bitcoin users to Alice.

Liked this talk.
Decentralization comes up many times during the talk. I think it's difficult for many people to grasp what that actually means because there are so few points of comparison.
For example, I don't think the investors plunking money into bank-like startups have really come to terms with what decentralization implies.
One minor nit: in several presentations now Andreas has floated idea that financial services can be run via SMS. I really don't see how this system can be called Bitcoin. Those SMS messages will be processed by a central operator somewhere who will be subject to all of the local regulations and pressures as any other bank.
I think downplaying this subtle, but key point may cause a lot of confusion down the road.

Rather than sending coins to a "burn address," where they're effectively locked forever, you send them to a script (P2SH address).
This script can only unlock the funds given some cryptographic proof that a condition has been met. If you tie that condition to something that happened on the side chain, it gives you a mechanism for running a two-way peg.

It looks like the inputs are coming from a brain wallet with a known private key.
There is only a single OP_RETURN output valued at 0. So the miner collected the value of all inputs as a fee. That makes sense.
But why were there were so many unspent outputs in a compromised brain wallet in the first place?
I've seen the assertion that it has something to do with the transaction flooding attack now underway - but how exactly? What motivates an attacker to flood a bunch of value into a broken brain wallet?

During the current "stress test" and the last one a few days ago, there were posts by users whose transactions wouldn't confirm after many hours. Nothing obvious was wrong with them. It was suggested that poor propagation was the culprit, and that network congestion was not the root cause.
One problem that can crop up from exchanges and other sites that make a lot of payments is that unconfirmed transactions get chained together. If one member of the chain fails to propagate, that can cause its descendants to be rejected as orphans.
I'm wondering if this is what all of these cases might have in common.

The one that comes to mind is HTTP 1.1, which is ubiquitous today and quite useful. It's successor, HTTP 2, is only now just getting off the ground, almost 20 years after HTTP 1.1 was standardized.
In various domains, you'll find de facto standards that haven't evolved in a similar time frame. The domain I'm familiar with, cheminformatics, has a couple of those. I suspect other domains have their share of effectively frozen specs as well.
What all of these technologies have in common is they're foundational, there were huge network effects at play, and they were good enough as-is.

What I heard in the presentation was not much more than a combination of ideas around P2P file sharing and electronic cash from that period.

See this description for more (my emphasis):


Bitcoin's innovation was a practical method to eliminate the mint, and that's described nowhere I could find in this presentation. The experience of creating an electronic cash system using a mint would have provided ample experience in its limitations, but that alone doesn't prove much.

It's often used to create a one way peg.
Let's say you invented a new kind of financial asset. You want to back it with something valuable to give it a sense of legitimacy. You can do this by burning bitcoin.

This is the reason Bitcoin may have a hard time gaining a foothold in a country in which banks are shut down for a prolonged period.
The Irish solution was based on debt. Money could be easily brought into being by making a new piece of paper. That's not possible with Bitcoin, which is an asset in its own right. To get it you need to consume something valuable.
What was different in Ireland is that the value stored in the bank was never in question, just the ability to access it. Greece finds itself in a fundamentally different situation. When the banks do open, there's no telling what value account holders will be able to pull out.
Nick Szabo offers an interesting way to think about it:


A prolonged bank stress test in Greece would provide ample opportunity for one or more of these cycles to be set up. Should that happen, Bitcoin could find itself with a foothold long after the immediate banking crises fades from memory.

The problem with zero-fee transactions is that they propagate poorly. Using child-pays-for-parent requires that the miner implementing it also has a copy of the parent. Getting this to happen can be tricky. It's not clear which miners have the right policies to accept both transactions.
You can clear it with a double spend using first-seen-safe replace-by-fee. Here's a tutorial that shows you how to set up a stuck transaction and then clear it. I wouldn't use the procedure if you're a beginner and your current transaction is valuable. Rather teach yourself first how the process works:

The thing that makes this complicated is that there is no "the mempool." It's convenient to talk about "the mempool," but there are really thousands of *mempools*.

@_date: 2015-08-11 16:12:35
Now that makes sense - thanks.
They're using the system proposed in BIP 100. Under this system, miners cast votes for a floating block size limit by encoding the (ASCII) bytes '/BV{size}/' into the response script of the coinbase transaction, where {size} is the block size limit the miner supports, in bytes.
Does this imply that the miners who are casting these votes have already implemented BIP 100?
This may seem like nitpicking, but there are multiple competing proposals for adjusting the block size limit. I believe BIP 100 is incompatible with, for example, BIP 101, on which Bitcoin XT is based. BIP 101 sets the block size limit deterministically, with no input from miners. 
@_date: 2015-07-15 17:52:31
True. Running a full node allows you to filter (censor) transactions you don't think should be relayed. Each node can (and does) choose its own policy, even if that is to just use the default provided by Bitcoin Core.
Even that is complicated though, because Core's transaction relay polices have changed a lot over the years. This heterogeneity of relay policies opens the door to double-spending unconfirmed transactions.

Either that or the wallet file itself, probably in encrypted form.


First, a disclaimer. Exporting private keys from Armory, and importing them into Electrum are two very bad ideas unless you know what you're doing and have a very good reason to do it. Doing so destroys the integrity of both the Armory wallet and the Electrum wallet.
Normally you'd spend funds out of Armory into Electrum, but clearly that wasn't an option. Desperate times, desperate measures - sure. But this is a good way to lose money. Be *very* careful with what you do next.
Moving onto the point at hand - that Electrum didn't show the complete balance. How do you know you exported *all* private keys from Armory? Also, how do you know what balance Armory should have shown?


Cold storage with Armory involves running two separate wallet instances. One runs on a computer connected to the Internet. The other runs on an offline computer (or equivalent). You need to specifically set this up. If you don't, you're not running offline Armory.
Another way to run Armory is as an all-in-one wallet. There's only ever one wallet instance and it's fully capable of spending money and checking balances. Was that the way you were using Armory?

There's a flip side to this. A lot of what's being funded by VCs at this stage isn't "startup-shaped," an idea I've been thinking about for awhile, but which I first heard Mike Hearn give a name to. It's not exactly what Mike was talking about, but I'll adapt it for this discussion.
What Bitcoin enables and what startup investors want to see tend to be diametrically opposed to each other. Investors like Peter Thiel want a startup to build an unassailable monopoly - not wallow in the muck of an open playing field:
Bitcoin at its best does the opposite - remove the middleman, and with him the need for his monopoly.
I've only seen this idea discussed once, in an interview William Mougayar did with Epicenter Bitcoin:
Look at the entries of this table of Bitcoin companies who received venture funding as of 2015:
The last five companies to receive funding are:
1. BitFury, a mining hardware manufacturer and operator
2. Ascribe, an asset registry
3. Vogogo, a payment processor
4. Case, a hardware wallet maker
5. Reveal, a social media/cryptocurrency hybrid
With the possible exception of the last company, which isn't specifically related to Bitcoin, imagine any one of these becoming a monopoly. Is Bitcoin better or worse off as a result?
Or look at it from another angle: what can any of these companies possibly do to become monopolies, rather than a grinding exploration of marginal costs? How do those things affect the usability, security, and privacy of using Bitcoin?
It seems investors have a choice: 
- set the "startup-shaped" problem aside and assume it will eventually work itself out; or
- keep looking for those Bitcoin companies solving problems that are startup-shaped
Edit: there's a third option as well:
1. Buy bitcoin.
2. Invest in a startup building Bitcoin infrastructure.
Profit from the increase in exchange rate the new infrastructure brings, and write the startup itself off as a tax loss.

A transaction reassigns ownership of one or more digital tokens called "coins." The more coins that are spent, the more data is required to do so.
The amount of data needed to represent a coin in a transaction is independent of the length of its history. Every coin has roughly the same data requirement. The biggest difference is the use of compressed public keys. Compression cuts the data requirement without affecting usability.
Length is also a function of the type of response script included in the transaction. A regular Alice-pays-Bob P2PKH challenge script leads to less data being used than a multisig P2SH challenge script.
Here's how to do a back-of-the-envelope calculation to estimate transaction size for P2PKH script transactions:

I haven't had a chance to go through the paper in detail, but this is my tentative understanding.
The main idea is to speed up the deployment of the Lightning Network. Bitcoin is almost ready for Lightning, but some soft-fork changes are needed before it can work as designed. Soft forks take time to discuss, implement, document, debug, and deploy. Even then, there's an element of risk in doing soft forks, as we saw not too long ago.
Toward this goal, the paper makes two main changes:
1. Eliminates the need for a transaction malleability soft fork. Malleability interferes with Lightning by allowing a third party to change the ID of a transaction without invalidating the signature or changing the outcome of executing the transaction. It's an old, well-known problem in Bitcoin.
2. Simplifies the way Lightning works by reducing the number of overall (off-chain) transactions that need to be assembled and maintained.
However, the paper adds a requirement for a new soft fork (OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY), which itself depends on a pending soft-fork, BIP 68:
The dependency on BIP 68 wasn't in the paper, but it was mentioned in this recent message:
The bottom line is that it's unclear to me how much more quickly this proposal could be implemented than the original. The way it streamlines the setup and maintenance of payment channels looks very useful.

Nothing prevents you from taking the (already published) patch and using it on you node.
Nor does anything prevent you from removing the block size limit altogether, effective immediately, by creating your own patch.
You don't need the approval of a single developer to do this. You control the software that your node runs. Just do it.
That's what "decentralization" means. It's a word to describe a situation in which nobody is in charge. Or more precisely, everyone is in charge.
It seems that what you're really asking for is for someone, or a group of someones to take charge and give you software to run on your node. There's a word for that:
The block size is set where it is now because changing it requires a hard fork update that effectively creates an alt coin. The Bitcoin protocol was designed to make hard forks very, very difficult to pull off. In fact, there has only been one situation that even came close to being a hard fork. It happened a long time ago and fixed a minor bug.
Enough node operators see participation in a hard fork experiment, right now, to be against their interests. That doesn't need to stop you, though.

Why not just refuse to add any transaction that pays below the minimum asking price? That way there is no out-of-pocket cost. No make-work transactions to publish, and no fees end up in the competition's pocket. Fees still get bid up.

@_date: 2015-07-16 22:50:52
Here's a thought experiment: raise the block size limit to 1.05 MB.
Remember that this isn't any old update. It's a hard fork, which means that every node operator, not just miners, must decide which side of the fork they'll stand on. The update effectively creates an altcoin that shares a common blockchain heritage with Bitcoin.
Given enough dissenters (or laggards, depending on your perspective), a chain split will develop. It may last for a long time. Coins held before the chain split would be spendable on either side, or both sides. Coins received on one side could only be redeemable by going through an exchange. Given an evenly-matched split, SPV users could see payments confirm and then mysteriously unconfirm. That could be resolved with a checkpoint, but at the expense of making the wallet incompatible with the other side.
There would essentially be two Bitcoins, and even individual users would have to decide which side they were on.
Assuming this analysis is correct, does increasing the block size limit by a small amount lead to a more or less risky situation than increasing it by a large amount?

Let's say Bob is a purveyor of fine Teletubbies merchandise. Bob also accepts every payment, including those from Alice and Coinbase with the same address.
Alice pays Bob for a Tinky Winky xmas ornament using her [address] from above.
Coinbase knows Bob's address. It also knows Alice's address. Therefore, Coinbase knows that Alice paid Bob, and when. If Coinbase were doing an investigation (ongoing investigations by Coinbase into user behavior should not be surprising given the regs they have to comply with), then Coinbase can try to locate Bob's catalog to find an item with almost the same price as Alice paid. At that point Coinbase can deduce not only that Alice paid Bob, but what for.
So, it's a matter of sweeping up as much information about as many customers as possible, then using it to fill in the blanks. The public and permanent nature of the block chain makes it all possible.

Satoshis/B is the most granular and clearest unit. Even if fees rise 100x, it will still be in a reasonable range for most transactions. Dealing with several leading zeros goes against convention. Bits/KB is a perfect example of why "bits" is such a problematic unit. It's just confusing to anyone knowledgeable about computers, but not Bitcoin.
The only problem is there isn't a standard symbol for satoshis - not that there's exactly one for bitcoin, either.

In the not-too-distant future Bitcoin users may be presented with a choice: follow an altcoin hard forked from Bitcoin that raises the 21M cap or stay with Bitcoin.
Before dismissing this as impossible, consider that the conditions at that point may be very different from what they are now.
Consider a scenarios in which, for whatever reason, Bitcoin is under constant attack because it has become more profitable to attack than to mine. Maybe the transaction fees aren't nearly enough to to compensate for cuts to the block reward. Maybe after the 2020 halving, for example.
At that point we'd have two very unpleasant choices to pick from. Suffer through a wave of double spends and other nonsense, or increase the block subsidy.
Things could start off innocently enough. Rather than inflating over all time, we could pay out the total sooner. The reward would increase in the short term, but the last reward would be paid out sooner.
Should that approach fail, the choice might be to stand idly by while the network is destroyed, or do something about it. And that something may well be to raise the 21 M cap.

You can. The number of shares is independent of the underlying face value of the coin in bitcoin.
In other words, your transaction would have one colored coin output (shares) and one uncolored output (bitcoin change).
The only restriction is that all outputs must stay above the dust limit of 546 satoshis ("standard" transaction rule). If the colored coin already carries a face value of 546 satoshis, then you couldn't spend any more of it.

Mining centralization is too often swept under the rug with glib pronouncements like these. The idea that double spending would be the goal is ridiculous on face value. A majority mining cartel can do a lot more than double spend a few transactions, and probably would.
For example, 51% of the network hash rate allows you to receive 100% of the mining reward - effectively starving your competition to death:
Once installed, a mining monopoly can change the protocol in fundamental ways through soft forks. For example, the block size could be increased - relegating non-generating nodes who don't get with the program to the status of door-stoppers:
Mining pools (in which many small hashers band together), is actually the benign form of centralization. Members who disagree with what the cartel is doing can leave very quickly, destroying the cartel's power base overnight.
The malignant form is a cartel that own its own hardware, and the means of producing chips. Beholden to no partner, the cartel can pursue the dream of every company - complete market domination.

A very thought-provoking article that tackles the question of how the Bitcoin protocol should be updated.
Mike quotes the Wiki:


That last sentence seems a bit extreme. Also, framing the issue in terms of a "winning" and "losing" side seems unjustified in that it's very unclear how long a chain split could persist. If it persists indefinitely, then the likelihood of "bitcoins permanently losing their value" seems very low. There would simply be two networks and two chains, each claiming to be Bitcoin.


This seems like a weak point. Regardless of whether the term existed, the early development team used soft forks to update the protocol. One example was the imposition of the 1 MB block size limit. Another with the Script fix that closed the loophole allowing anyone to spend anyone else's coins. Yet another was the overflow bug that allowed the creation of large amounts of bitcoin out of thin air.


Maybe some soft forks are like this, but *all* of them? That's not clear. When the block size limit was imposed, that was a soft fork. What were old nodes tricked into doing exactly?




This is an interesting case. Selecting the non-existent OP_RUN operator makes this a hard fork. As notes, using a non-reserved opcode would have produced a soft fork update. It turns out there are a few of those lying around (OP_NOP1 - OP_NOP10). They serve no purpose I can see other than to allow new operations to be defined through the soft fork mechanism:


Read about it here - both the debate and technical details are relevant:


This is the main point of the article. The problem is that it applies for some kinds of updates, but not others. The example Mike gives of OP_RUN is a good example of having a choice. But other kinds of updates (such as lowering/raising the block size limit) don't give you such a choice. There's no way I can think of to make lowering the block size limit a hard fork. It's a soft fork by nature. Am I missing something here?
Interestingly, every soft fork has a hard fork counterpart. The 0.8.1 update for example, had elements of both in that it imposed a limit on the number of unique IDs referenced in a block and then later removed it:
So the soft fork updates implemented today become hard fork updates if/when they are removed. The goalpost of what constitutes a hard fork update moves as long as soft forks are adopted.

Actually, there is. The thing you want from a private key is the ability to sign a transaction unlocking coins that were previously locked.
You can sign a test message and verify the message signature with a different piece of software. One pairing might be:

I would call the post-hard fork Bitcoin something else, but the closest term is "altcoin." My working definition of altcoin:


I don't use this term in a derogatory way, but simply to make the technical point that any hard fork creates an altcoin, regardless of who personally backs it or what its goals might be.
Imagine I decide to unilaterally push a hard fork update to my node that tomorrow increases the block size limit to 2 MB. What would you call my new creation?

Changing the 21M limit would require a *hard fork* update. It's not impossible, and it may be attempted at some point by a group with the credibility to carry it out. A hard fork produces an altcoin that shares a common block chain ancestry with Bitcoin.
There's this idea that Bitcoin is regulated by math, and to an extent it is. However, Bitcoin is also regulated by the consent of those running full nodes (not just miners). If enough of those node operators decide the limit should be 100M, for example, they can create an altcoin that makes it so.
The closest thing to a hard fork that's ever happened was a minor bugfix many years ago. Other than that, no hard fork update has ever gained enough support to be a credible altcoin.
@_date: 2016-02-09 15:30:59


Maybe for you, but there are plenty of Bitcoin users who would see such a system as valuable in other ways. For example, consider the numerous groups working on permissioned ledgers. The benevolent mining monopoly is effectively a permissioned ledger with a single operator.
To generate further support, the monopoly could abolish the block size limit through a soft fork. That same soft fork could add useful new transaction features that have never made it past the discussion phase previously.
As a holder of Bitcoin, you'd have a choice. Either leave or stay. If the monopoly made it clear that its intent was to make Bitcoin even better as an instant global payment system - with low fees and fast confirmation times for everyone -  it would generate a large following. You may not be among them, but many others would likely stick around.
Finally, crisis has a way of lowering resistance to a strong man stepping in to restore order. An existential crisis could be all the reason needed for many users to go along with the plan, if grudgingly. As evidence, I'd cite this:

My best guess based on the available information:
At some point you imported the private key to the 1QBhGLEMM7fGAMk3uXNV6VqfTfg3TFawKc address, possibly forgetting about it.
That private key has been described in this Chinese tutorial. There appear to be a few versions of it floating around:
Whenever private keys are published on Web pages, they're swept up into attacker dictionaries that do nothing but monitor the block chain looking for deposits into the corresponding address. A bot found your payment and quickly took it.
The odds of Bitcoin Core generating this address on its own, assuming a perfect random number generator, are approximately 1 in 10^48.
In other words, this problem most likely had little to do with Bitcoin-Qt.

BTW, the connection to Bitcoin as I see it: cash and gold have zero nominal yield. As such, they've been ridiculed as stores of value by mainstream economists for decades. Similar economic arguments have been trotted out against bitcoin.
With a large chunk of the world's government debt now paying negative yields, physical cash and gold could stage a comeback. But both are hard to authenticate, store, and transport. Not to mention the severe legal complication you can face in dealing with large sums of cash.
Bitcoin offers obvious advantages on these counts.

Regarding the block size limit, this is is a long sentence that seems parsible in at least two ways:

First, privacy in Bitcoin is complicated - *very* complicated.
Are you re-using a single address? If so, then yes, anyone you pay or receive payment from can track when you make payments, their amounts, and the addresses involved. They can do this for as long as you continue using that address.
If you're using disposable addresses (receive one payment, spend it, dispose of address), then this is harder. Payers and payees can only follow what happens to the funds in the one address you revealed.
However, if you spend from two addresses in one transaction, then you start to leak more privacy. All mobile wallets, for example, will do this behind your back if the conditions are right.

As of now, there are only 5 confirmations. There probably isn't an issue, but in the very unlikely event of a 5 block reorganization, you could potentially lose it all given that you've posted the private key. For example, if you were making a 15 BTC purchase, it would be recommended to wait six confirmations as standard procedure.
Other than that, it looks like an insecure passphrase. If your new one is also self chosen, you might want to consider making a proper brain wallet by memorizing a random seed. For example:
Either way, you might also consider keeping an unencrypted paper backup. You're more likely to forget a very secure brain wallet passphrase than have a paper backup stolen from a secure location.

There's a really hard bootstrapping problem here.
Even if you use PGP, as explains, you and your partner still need to exchange public keys over a secure channel. Otherwise the man-in-the-middle can just feed you his public key. It's the same problem that pointed out, but this time with PGP keys rather than Bitcoin keys.
See, for example:
To be "100% sure," you need to meet in person to exchange keys. Of course, if you can do that, you might as well have your partner give you a list of good addresses.
Alternatively, you need someone you trust to vouch for your partner's public key before you start sending encrypted messages. And those communications with the trusted friend will need to take place via PGP. There still needs to be an in-person meeting.
When you start thinking about how the man-in-the-middle attack works, it might not even be clear that the person you've been communicating with is who s/he says they are. That's the kind of rabbit hole you can fall through if you take this to its logical conclusion.
You can loosen these requirements, but doing so will take you away from "100%" certainty.

This raises the question of what those investors want in exchange. In other words, what exactly is Blockstream's business model? Here's my best guess based on published materials.
From the article:


Here's a bit about Liquid:


So this seems to be the business model. Exchanges have the problem of securely and quickly transferring funds amongst themselves, which reduces liquidity. Liquid solves this problem with an approach based on sidechains. Blockstream builds Liquid and charges a fee to subscribers for using it.
Presumably, Liquid will be used as the model system for other sidechains, possibly to be used in other areas of the economy.

A hard fork release can be published very quickly - within a day or less.
The thing to remember is that there is no "the block chain." There are individual block chains maintained on each of the few thousand or so full nodes. Each node operator sets the rules and update schedule for their own node.
If a node operator doesn't want to update, they won't. There is no such thing as a mandatory update; there's no way to enforce it.
In the meantime, a chain split would be very likely. That incident over the weekend is just a sample of the confusion a persistent chain split would cause.

- exported a privkey
- closed Core, made wallet.dat backup
- restarted Core, with new wallet
- imported privkey, rescanned (takes more than 30 seconds, these days ;)
- was able to send the same input second time
It's not even clear to me that this procedure will work. You might want to find a miner who supports replace-by-fee and directly submit the transaction to them.

Putting Bitcoin into cold storage is only half the problem. Getting it out, securely and privately is the other half. It's the half that many new users don't spend enough time thinking about.
Paper wallets are just one solution to the cold storage problem, and not a very good one. Before committing funds, it might be a good idea to step back and think about the reason we do cold storage in the first place - the problems it solves. Here's a high level overview:
Before buying larger amounts of Bitcoin, I suggest buying a very small amount for the purpose of getting hands on experience. You will probably lose it, but learn a lot in the process.
Some advocate buying a Trezor as a workaround to learning about cold storage. I'm not sure I agree. Even with a hardware wallet, there's enough that can go wrong that you'll need a solid understanding going into it.

Maybe I'm missing something big here then. I'd be interested in your take on this:
From what I understand, the SegWit proposal would enable a transaction style in which the signature data are stored externally to the block in which the transaction appears.
Gains in block space under this system require the use of SegWit-style transactions. If nobody uses them, then block space does not expand under SegWit. And so the use of the term "effective."

You'll probably get advice to use Trezor, Ledger, or other hardware solutions. They're good products.
However, you can still get into trouble with these solutions if you don't understand how they work and why. The best advice I can give you is to take a deep-dive into how Bitcoin works. At this stage in Bitcoin's evolution, there's really no alternative.
As for starting points, you might learn what "electronic cash" really means:
Many of the problems I see people have with security and privacy boil down to not understanding the basic idea of electronic cash.
If that's old hat, you might try practicing the secure storage (and retrieval!) of chump change using a system like this:
I wouldn't use this system for serious money, but you'll be able to figure out what exactly you need to protect, and why. You'll also get a much better idea of the operational security method that will work best for you.

For those who may be wondering what the significance of two spaces is, it's something only the &gt;40ish crowd still does and comes from learning to type on a typewriter. Satoshi apparently used double spaces after periods. See, for example:
Satoshi also tended to write using perfect English grammar. His tone was muted and factual. Satoshi cited the B-money paper in his white paper as well.
Given these connections, the OP appears to be asking whether this author of the email is in fact Satoshi.
Going a little deeper, consider this passage from the email:


money.  Unlike most commodity money, in this case the commodity is not
intrinsically valuable.  However it is scarce, and more can be created
only at a considerable cost.  *An analogy might be money based on a rare
earth element like Terbium (which, let's suppose, has no industrial uses).
Terbium based money would be immune to inflation, like gold backed money,
but the element is not valuable in itself; it is only valuable for its
role as money.* [my emphasis]
Now compare with this, which Satoshis wrote:

If you're a user, you can run a full node to improve your own privacy and security. If you use a light wallet, your server (or peers) can tie your transactions together, leaking privacy.
Running a light wallet is also inherently less secure because you're not validating entire blocks. Your peers/server can lie by omission, leaving out transactions, and there's a limit to what you can do about it.
Merchants can run full nodes if processing their own payments to avoid relying on third parties.
Running a full node and connecting to it can overcome these limitations. In some cases they don't matter too much. In others, they matter a lot.

Gavin's fee rework proposal states:


This makes sense because a miner should be interested in packing a block with as much value in fees as possible. Sorting by descending fee density (fee per byte of transaction data), makes this possible.
But looking through the source code in miner.cpp, it's not clear that memory pool transactions are actually sorted by fee density. I'm probably missing something, but the TxPriorityCompare function seems to be looking at absolute fee, not fee density.
Where in the Bitcoin Core source code does fee density, rather than absolute fee, factor into prioritizing memory pool transactions?

The page you linked appears to be displaying real time data. The fee structure in most wallets, and presumably Mycelium, is static.
The problem with letting users set their own fees is that they often set them too low. I've seen dozens (hundreds?) of threads here from users with stuck transactions. Those transactions got stuck because the wallet gave the option to skimp on fees and the user jumped at the chance.
Maybe this will change.

I like Armory, but it should be remembered that it doesn't (yet) support compressed public keys.

Trust is one angle from which to understand what's happening, but another is *censorship-resistance*. Censorship-resistance means that it's hard to block access to anyone on the network who follows the protocol.
Sometimes censorship-resistance matters a lot. An electronic cash system like Bitcoin needs censorship-resistance to support fungibility, among other features.
Sometimes, however, censorship-resistance is more trouble than it's worth. A bank cartel doesn't care about censorship-resistance because all parties are known and access to systems is enforced through the legal system. All that's needed is a way to identify parties on the network and ensure they don't overstep their roles.
But the technology stack on which Bitcoin sits offers features beyond censorship-resistance. One of them is a practical solution to the distributed consensus problem. Financial institutions see this and want to use it to improve their business processes.
Regarding innovation, Andreas is looking at this too narrowly. One of the prices we pay for censorship-resistance is that everyone gets a voice. Changes to the core protocol are slow for this reason.
Although it's true that an open system supports innovation at the edge, it makes innovation at the core very difficult. I don't want to point out specific examples for fear of going off-topic, but hopefully it's clear that changing the core Bitcoin protocol is much more difficult than it would be if one entity were calling the shots.
When someone using Bitcoin wants to try something radically different, they tend not to change Bitcoin Core. They tend to start a separate project.
And let's be clear: nobody who wants to stay out of jail will be starting a bank from their garage - at least not in the US. Developing tools to make banks obsolete - maybe.

Yes, there are coins, but they're called "unspent transaction outputs." There's more on the idea here:
The weird thing is that the system doesn't track individual satoshis.
Here's an analogy that might work for you. Everyone transacts with gold lumps measured in milligrams. Alice wants to pay Bob for a book. The book costs 100 milligrams of gold, but Alice only has two lumps weighing 75 milligrams apiece.
Whenever the parties in this money system trade, one of them melts down one or more gold lumps, and recasts the molten gold into a gold lump exactly matching the mass the payee expects. When the payee spends the lump, he must do the same. A transaction is simply the melting and recasting of gold lumps.
Alice pays Bob by melting down her two 75 milligram lumps and casting two more: one weighing 100 milligrams to pay Bob, and one weighing 50 milligrams to take as change. 
That's essentially how Bitcoin transactions work. One or more coins are combined to make one or more new coins. The main difference is that Bitcoin preserves the history of melting and recasting on the block chain.

What will Bitrefill's policy be in the event they end up on a chain with miniscule hash power support?
Will they:
- rollback UASF?

- go out of business?
UASF lacks an on-chain signaling mechanism. AFAICT, it lacks even network-level support for nodes to communicate what they will accept.
This kind of activation, although it may appear to give power "back" to users, can lead to a variety of unintended consequences. Soft forks are very risky even with versionbits and signaling. Removing those safety features seems like a recipe for uncertainty.
For example, does anyone remember the troubled BIP-66 rollout?

A node seeing the same outputs spent in two unconfirmed transactions will, by default, reject the second transaction as a double spend.
However, nodes are free to do whatever they want with the transactions in memory - up to and including throwing them all out or specifically choosing the second of a pair of double spending transactions.
Replace-by-Fee is a good example. When running it, a node will accept the second version of a double spend if the fees are higher.

The reason to use a tumbler is to attempt to repair a privacy leak. Specifically, one or more pseudonyms you control have been linked to one of more public keys.
You want to assume ownership of another user's coins to break the link.
Sending coins you've already taken ownership of to many different addresses doesn't fix the problem that tumblers are used for.
FWIW, it's much better to avoid leaking privacy in the first place. Tumbler efficacy is questionable at best, and if one fails on you, it can be disastrous.

Not quite. What's actually happening is that you need to fully spend an electronic token called a "coin." Multiple coins can be locked to the same address.
Most wallets do their best to hide the entire concept of coins from you, which causes many security and privacy problems. When you are forced to interact with the protocol, you approach it with the bad mental model your wallet reinforced.

Here's an attempt to summarize this somewhat confusing statement:
A group convened in Hong Kong to discuss two specific technical items:
- [Segregated Witness]( (SegWit); and
- a hard fork increase to the block size limit
Present were members of the Bitcoin Core team, miners, exchanges, and other groups. The group unanimously agreed to the following:
1. SegWit will continue to be developed as a soft fork. Expected release date is April 2016.
2. A hard fork update will be developed "based on the improvements in SegWit." Expected release date is June 2016.
3. The hard fork will expand non-witness block space (regular block space) to 2 MB. The combination of SegWit and the hard fork will expand effective block size to up to 4 MB.
4. The hard fork may contain other, unspecified, changes.
5. Members agreed to run only "Bitcoin Core-compatible" systems for the "foreseeable future."
6. Hard fork activation is expected to happen around July 2017.
Of all these points, I'd say (4) is the most important. An impressive hard fork wish list has been growing over the last 5 years:
A hard fork update isn't easy to pull off, and I suspect many would like this to be the last one for a very long time. The tension between including as many new features as possible and sticking to the task at hand could prove challenging.
edit: clarifications

The entire protocol can be rewritten from scratch using merely soft forks and majority hash power. I share your hope that this power won't be abused, but experience tells me otherwise.

For those who will suggest that Samurai should use SPV (of the Bloom Filter variety), that may be a somewhat better system, but with it's own fair share of complex, non-intuitive privacy limitations. See, for example:
The best solution I can think of would be for the Samurai Wallet to connect to user-selectable Electrum servers. Advantages:
1. All communication encrypted using HTTPS.
2. User decides whether to trust the entire network of a few dozen servers, or one in particular.
3. Electrum servers support Tor connections explicitly.
4. User can run a dedicated Electrum server, if so desired.
5. Electrum server is open source.
Setting up and running an Electrum server isn't easy and would likely be a multi-weekend project, even for someone with technical experience:
From time to time, programmers just getting into Bitcoin ask for project ideas. Well, if this is you, you might consider coming up with a way to make Electrum servers (or Electrum-like servers) easier to set up and maintain.

Yes, the point is clearly to cut miners and protocol-level signaling out of the equation. However, doing that leads to different forms of signaling, such as the OP announcement.
What I'm asking is a simple question:
For those such as Bitrefill who are "signaling" off-chain through Twitter and other media, what will be the policy should the UASF fly off the rails?
Edit responding to edit:


That's an interesting way to look at it. However, the reason it was clear what should happen was that the signaling period had taken place in a quantifiable, non-gameable way (proof-of-work).
UASF, as far as I can tell, is a tradeoff whereby a non-gameable upgrade signaling mechanism is replaced by one with far more potential for gaming and misinterpretation.
Both approaches to soft forks are far from ideal. But at the moment UASF seems to be a step backward in terms of predictability of outcome.

You could also take it one step further and simply use VISA, a true winner-take-all. Your fee would be zero.
Part of the problem is the inherent inefficiency of public block chains. Each year it seems ever less likely that Bitcoin will make even a small dent in payments market for large retailers. There's too much friction on both the customer and merchant side. Smaller merchants are a different matter, so maybe there will be a story to tell in a few years.
It seems more likely in the short term that Bitcoin will become a safety valve for money trying to escape hostile government regulation. In that case, much higher fees than with any other payment system would be well-tolerated. No others could compete with it.

A slightly different form of this condition happened over the weekend, and mainly affected users relying on light wallets. In those cases, you'll need to wait for many more confirmations than otherwise before considering a transaction final.
The white paper explains the math behind transaction reversal in the last section ("Calculations"):

The makers of Trezor advise users to create a paper backup. This consists of writing 24 words onto a piece of paper. The Trezor could die in a fire and you'd still be able to get your money with just that piece of paper. You wouldn't even need to use another Trezor to do it.
In effect, it's a paper wallet, but much more powerful.

There are those parts of the protocol that are enforceable, and those parts that are unenforceable.
What happens to zero-confirmation transactions is unenforceable in that there is no penalty that can be levied against anyone who appears to go against convention.
If you generate invalid blocks, you will be penalized. If you relay double spends, there isn't not a whole lot that can be done. You can disconnect a peer deemed to be "misbehaving", but that just creates two relay networks and the double spends get confirmed anyway.
Making matters more complicated, some folks want double spends to be relayed precisely to improve the security of zeroconf transactions:

The first step of signing an input is to replace its response script with the challenge script of the unspent output it references.
AFAIK, Satoshi never documented his reasoning for this procedure. It's still not clear to me what advantage, if any, this offers. As you suggest, the signature could just as easily be calculated by only removing the input's response script.
Many features of Script have been disabled. The system was at one point much more powerful (if more buggy) than it is now. Perhaps this procedure was needed to support one of those now missing features.

Bitcoin is an "electronic cash system." That probably doesn't mean what it seems at first. It means that Bitcoin users trade electronic tokens with each other the same way that physical cash users trade bank notes and metal coins.

The problem is that too many beginners skip over this critical concept, carrying their misconceptions with them - to the detriment of themselves and those they transact with.
Whether it's understand why we need miners in the first place, what financial privacy with Bitcoin means, or understanding the block size limit, the concept of electronic cash factors prominently. You really can't understand Bitcoin without first taking the time to understand what electronic cash is.

Fun analogy. I'll try to expand it a bit:
- The bus actually holds any number of passengers.
- The bus can only leave the station if the total weight of passengers is 10,000 pounds or less (block size limit).
- Fares are charged by the pound. Your fee = your total weight in pounds * the market fee/pound. The heavier you are, the more you pay. (fee density)
- You don't know how much the fee/pound is until the bus leaves the station. (fee market)
- If you ask, however, the driver will tell you what the fee rate was for the last several busses. Oddly, most passengers don't bother to ask (
- Busses leave at erratic intervals, making late passengers feel helpless, confused, and angry. (confirmation)
- By law, each passenger must carry a backpack containing at least ten 10-pound bricks. (transaction signatures). The weight of these bricks counts toward your weight.
- There is a petition to relax the brick requirement. You only need to bring one brick on the bus, provided you can prove that the other nine are stored in a locker (segregated witness).

It it really the same thing?
AFAICT, weak blocks and the OP proposal solve different problems.
Weak blocks give miners a better picture of what the active chain will be in the future. Rather than announcing a block with full proof-of-work, miners would announce blocks with a fraction of the needed pow as a way to communicate where they see the active chain going in the near future.
The OP proposal, on the other hand, would segment the block reward at the protocol level, breaking the current winner-take-all system and encouraging the (re-)entry of small miners.

Double spending would be bad for business.
However, crushing the competition (i.e., other pools) could be very good for business.
With competition out of the way, every block reward goes to the cartel. Not only that, but the cartel can guarantee changes to the protocol through soft forks.

I'm not so sure. The block size limit can be completely abolished through a soft fork:
Even more, the protocol can be rewritten at a fundamental level. Completely new transaction types, scripts, and signatures. New subsidies. You name it, there's probably a way to do it with a soft fork.
The worst part is what happens to full nodes that don't update. They become irrelevant, but without a way to tell that something has changed. Old nodes just stop seeing any transactions other than the coinbase.
In practical terms, this upgrade path collapses to a simple endpoint: miners have the ultimate say in defining the rules. And those rules can change given a simple majority of hash power.

Every block references a parent through its hash value:
To alter a block, you must find another block that hashes to the same value as the original. That requires brute force and approximately 2^128 tries. It's not feasible by anyone today.


The altered block must yield exactly the same hash value as the original, or the nodes in the P2P network will reject it.


Instead of thinking in terms of a block chain, try thinking in terms of a block tree. As in the example below, each block claims exactly one parent (A), but two blocks can claim the same parent (e.g., B1, B2).
      +-B2
    A+
      +-B1
    
Two blocks claiming the same parent (as in your example) create a split. The branch with the most cumulative proof-of-work wins (i.e., the "strongest" chain).
To answer your question about what exactly happens - that depends. If the new block has enoug that build on it, then the node starts following the new branch. Otherwise, the block gets stored and mostly ignored.
There is no "alert" nor is there a need for it. Occasional branches are part of the protocol and no big deal. Proof-of-work resolves all chain splits.

From section 8:


linking the transaction to the block it's timestamped in. He can't check the transaction for himself, but by linking it to a place in the chain, he can see that a network node has accepted it, and blocks added after it further confirm the network has accepted it.


Both paragraphs are important, and the first is too often read in isolation. As currently implemented, SPV doesn't allow a full node to warn an SPV peer about a transaction with an invalid chain-of-ownership. Nor does today's SPV allow a node to know whether blocks themselves are invalid. This could occur during a hard fork, for example, when block size limits are no longer respected. An SPV node can only read headers; to determine block size, it would have to download all blocks, something it is trying to avoid.
This is one of the reasons that a hard fork without a point of invalidity visible through the block header, can be disruptive.

Precision isn't the problem. Economics is the problem. Users find high fees unacceptable for many applications. LN isn't ready yet. Expanding block space looks like an easy fix until the real solution comes along. With no other way to finance network security, inflation as far as the eye can see is the only option.
That's the pressure Bitcoin will face.


I don't think you're picturing what hyperbitcoinization would look like in enough detail, nor are you considering the full range of attacks and motivations for attacks that become possible when Bitcoin is ubiquitous.
Consider, for example, the UTXO database bug in Bitcoin Core. Fortunately, it was fixed before it became an issue (or so it seems now). When entire industries seize up  due to a Bitcoin exploit, that creates a very different incentive structure. That's where national security lives.
Or, consider the damage that could be done by attacking a highly-connected LN node. Publish its 1 M invalid channel states and watch Bitcoin come to a grinding halt as fees spike to the stratosphere and nobody can open or close channels due to lack of block space.


They flow when Bitcoin usage increases and ebb when it decreases. Hyperbitcoinization would lead to a tsunami of centralization pressure.


I'm looking forward to seeing any segment of the Bitcoin economy reverse course after becoming more centralized. Unfortunately I can't think of a single one. Can you? A press release from a single company does not undo mining centralization.

I observed something similar with a twist. The last half of the time was taken up by validating the last year's worth of (full) blocks. This is only going to get worse - even if block weight stays put.
Big blockers will tell you that we should not try to optimize exceptional cases like yours (spinning a new node up from scratch).
I disagree. If Bitcoin users double in number every year, then 50% of the possible user base is brand new. And these users are being turned away in droves from running a full node - the most secure and private option for using Bitcoin.

Considering that about two decades of fruitless computer science research went into figuring out how to do electronic cash right, it's a big idea. "Electronic payments" are nothing like electronic cash. At the very least, clinging to this incorrect analogy obscures the need for having a block chain in the first place. And it leads to countless misconceptions, and even loss of funds.


The need to create digital scarcity follows directly from the idea of electronic cash. Electronic cash requires double spending protection, which leads to a public transaction log, which leads to a distributed system of validators.
Logic aside, from the perspective of explaining Bitcoin to beginners, it makes more sense to motivate the solution (digital scarcity through double spending protection) with the problem (how to create secure electronic cash). I see way too many explanations that put the cart in front of the horse. They only succeed in sowing confusion.

I'm no fan of 2x, but this seems a little hyperbolic.
What's going to happen is that a group of people will attempt to create a forkcoin. A lot of well-meaning people want the block space increase it brings. Some of them feel obligated to go along because they signed an agreement - even though they might not care one iota about the block space increase.
I don't think it will be anything approaching a "government takeover." More likely, it will look and act a lot like Bitcoin. The main difference is that its users will expect a block space increase at the slightest hint of fee pressure.
This will create an interesting dynamic, not unlike the situation with Bitcoin Cash. We're more than 80% into distributing Bitcoin's money supply through the block subsidy. After that, there are only two ways to pay for network security:
- transaction fees; or
- continued inflation.
(We can safely disregard the highly theoretical assurance contracts idea).
I suspect all three networks to be running at least a few years out. Not only that, but I expect dozens of fork coins to appear over the next year or two. Bitcoin Cash and 2x may end up being small fish in a rather large pond.

The main innovation represented by Bitcoin is "electronic cash." It's a concept most beginners skip, but which is central to understanding Bitcoin:

"Double spending" as used in the white paper refers to the problem that the same "digital coin" can be spent two or more times. This only makes sense if you understand that Bitcoin's concept of money revolves around a coin model, in which all money is represented as a token with fixed face value. In other words, Bitcoin is an "electronic cash" system. It's literally cash in electronic form.
Financial institutions (and some cryptos such as Ethereum) use an account model, in which money is debited and credited as a lump sum. There are no tokens. This is not how Bitcoin works.


Yes. Even though the two models differ in how they work, the problem remains that in the account model, a user can spend into a negative balance. When dealing directly with your own bank, there isn't much of a problem because the bank knows all of your transactions.
However, when moving money between entities with different banks, the double spending problem starts to show up. That's where services with names you may have heard of before come in:

You raise some good points. In the early days, many new users thought that Bitcoin would become some kind of alternative Visa system. It turns out that Bitcoin can't compete on that playing field because centralized systems will always win. They scale better, both in terms of volume and number of users. They can be upgraded more quickly. They play well with the banking system.
I think a lot of the disappointment has to do with people not understanding what Bitcoin is. And you can only really understand that by watching how people actually use Bitcoin, rather than listening to what they say they'll use it for.
So here are some thoughts:
1. financial speculation is a use case;
2. censorship-resistant money (think civil asset forfeiture, for example) is a use case;
3. borderless transfer of value is a use case;
4. black market workarounds encompass many use cases;
5. hedging against inflation and other economic shocks is a massive use case;
5. Bitcoin isn't finished being created yet.

Interesting story, and this is how most explanations out there go. The problem isn't with the listener, it's with the story.
Electronic cash is the "big idea" on which Bitcoin is based. Not mining. Not the block chain. Not hard money.
Electronic cash. That doesn't mean what the vast majority of people think it means.
We have physical cash (pull out a $20 bill from your pocket). I can give it to you (give it to him), and you can give it to me (ask him for it). When we do that, we exchange monetary value.
There is zero mystery to this.
But now the plot thickens. What if it were possible to exchange tokens of value that consisted, not of paper, but of electronic data? How would such a system work and what problems would it have to solve? More importantly, what advantages would such a system have over physical cash?
Everything in Bitcoin flows from this simple premise.

Bitcoin's immaturity will act as a natural brake on any movement toward mass adoption.
Bitcoin's problems are too many to enumerate here. Suffice it to say that in the very unlikely event that something like "hyperbitcoinization" starts to happen, the experience of using Bitcoin will suffer. For example:
- centralization pressure will surpass anything we've seen before
- the 21 million cap will become the next block size limit debate
- social engineering attacks as far as the eye can see
- attackers will find bugs lurking in the darndest places, and they won't give a hoot about "responsible disclosure"
- the infrastructure won't be ready to cope with the user load; this goes well beyond transactions per second

What if I told you it was both? It's an artificial, arbitrary limit enforced mathematically. It's not a constant of nature like the speed of light.
The limit is arbitrary in that it's a nice round (sort of:  number picked by Satoshi.
The limit is mathematically enforced through software run by nodes that:
- check that the block subsidy is not being overpaid;
- ensure that blocks are generated at a rate of 6/hour;
- enforce constraints on an attacker attempting to overwhelm the network with bogus blocks.


It is not. Like the block size limit, the circulation cap can be changed through a hard fork.
It can also be changed through a soft fork:

Sound principles that the creators of any future forkcoins would do well to consider:
- Strong two way transaction replay protection, enabled by default, such that transactions on each chain are invalid on the other chain.
- A clean break, such that the new chain cannot be “wiped out” by the original chain.
- A modification to the block header, such that all wallets (including light clients) are required to upgrade to follow the hardforked chain.
- A change in address format, to prevent people inadvertently sending coins to an address on the wrong chain.
- New P2P network magic, to ensure a functioning and reliable node network for the both coins.
In other words, a hard fork should be a mandatory op-in upgrade. No stealth hard forks will be tolerated.

I don't know offhand of an article that does this.
The white paper is very clear about the limitations of SPV:


vulnerable if the network is overpowered by an attacker. While network nodes can verify
transactions for themselves, the simplified method can be fooled by an attacker's fabricated
transactions for as long as the attacker can continue to overpower the network. One strategy to
protect against this would be to accept alerts from network nodes when they detect an invalid
block, prompting the user's software to download the full block and alerted transactions to
confirm the inconsistency. Businesses that receive frequent payments will probably still want to
run their own nodes for more independent security and quicker verification.
An SPV node will blindly follow the chain with the most proof-of-work, even if it's invalid. This situation results from the fact that SPV nodes, by definition, don't download or validate block bodies. So, a malicious majority can feed SPV nodes headers linked to invalid bodies (overpaid coinbase, fraudulent transactions, block size too large, etc), and the SPV node can't tell the difference. If the block header is invalid, the SPV node can detect fraud, but fraud in the body can't be detected.
The "alert" system that Satoshi wrote about was never implemented.
Then there's the privacy angle. Bloom filters don't obfuscate much (given that both public key and public key hash are encoded by some implementations). So the node you query can narrow things down a lot. If you re-submit a filter, a binary-AND between old and new filters will allow much higher resolution re-assembly of the wallet.

They wouldn't do that. Instead, Alice would just pay Bob one bitcoin.


The white paper is outdated and confusing. I can recommend this excellent series, though:
The key concept to understand is "revocability." It's the idea that an unconfirmed transaction can be invalidated. Say Alice and Bob start with 2 BTC apiece. Alice pays Bob 1 BTC with an off-chain transaction. Alice now has 1 BTC and Bob has 3 BTC in the channel.
What keeps Alice from publishing the previous transaction, which Bob signed, and which gives Alice 2 BTC instead of her current 1 BTC?

See my response to below. You raise a good question that I haven't found a good answer to. It may have to do with performance.

An SPV node only reads block headers. The full contents of block bodies are never requested. This is the main idea behind SPV.
So when a &gt;1MB block appears, SPV nodes can't tell the difference. They will blindly follow whichever chain has the most proof-of-work, regardless of what shenanigans are taking place inside blocks. For example, a coinbase transaction could be paying a miner 1,000 bitcoin and an SPV node wouldn't care as long as the header is valid.
Full nodes will have wipeout protected because 2x will require a mandatory &gt;1MB block that full nodes will reject.
SPV nodes won't notice the difference.
If the 2x hash rate fluctuates by a lot, and there's every reason to think this is possible, then SPV nodes could be forced onto and off of the 2x chain, possibly repeatedly. When this happens, chunks of transaction history will  be "wiped out."
As an SPV wallet user, you may notice that one hour your payment is has six confirmations and the next it's gone.

Sounds like your computer has a man-in-the-middle installed on it that switches Bitcoin addresses. Treat your computer as the hostile entity that it now appears to be.
This is one of the reasons you never sign big transactions on a hot wallet. Signing on an air-gapped computer gives you the chance to spot this kind of thing before publishing the transaction.

You can download an Electrum source distribution and run it directly. That way you can run any version you want. Make sure you've validated the signature.
Create a custom launcher (a *.desktop file) to run the source bundle. This article touches on the basics (see the section talking about Testnet):

No. Only one of the nodes you're connected to needs to relay the block containing the transaction. Your node can see that it's valid. The number of nodes that agree isn't important.
However, if none of the nodes that you're connected with know about the block, then you'll never see it.

Before you can even talk about block chains, you need to understand the part almost everyone skips: electronic cash.
Bitcoin is an electronic cash system. This doesn't just mean we can move money around electronically - banks have been doing that for years.
It means that Bitcoin works very much like metal coins and paper bank notes (physical cash). There are electronic tokens called "coins" or possibly "outputs," depending on the context. Like a physical coin, each of these electronic coins has a face value and security features built into it. The value of tokens can be combined and split when making payments, just like physical cash. Tokens can be lost or stolen, just like physical cash. Payments are made without a middleman, just like physical cash. Payments between two parties can't be prevented - just like physical cash.
Unlike physical cash, electronic coins have no physical presence. This means that value can be exchanged at great distance, securely and very rapidly.

You should keep in mind that Coinbase owns your bitcoin - you gave it to them in exchange for a promise to pay it back. Coinbase decides what will happen to the funds in the event of a chain split - not you.

For those who may be wondering, this is a proposal to create a new smart contracts language running on the Bitcoin block chain.
There is already one called Script. Every Bitcoin transaction uses Script, and has done so from the Genesis Block. If anyone tries to tell you that Bitcoin doesn't do "smart contracts," they clearly don't know much about smart contracts or Bitcoin.
Still, Script has limitations. Simplicity aims to correct them. From what I can tell, it:
- hides unexecuted branches through the contract (MAST), leading to better privacy;
- starts with a clean slate, eliminating some of Scripts bugs (e.g., the off-by-one multisig error);
- offers more expressive language meaning that contracts can do more; and
- enables analysis tooling to prevent bugs before contracts go live.
That last point is especially important in light of the many, large scale contracts problems that have plagued Ethereum smart contracts.
At the same time, Simplicity, leaves out some of Ethereum's more dangerous (or useful, depending on your perspective) features such as recursion and loops. 
From the paper's conclusion:


One of segwit's more interesting features was the ability to implement completely new smart contract languages via soft fork. This may be how Simplicity can be deployed, but the paper doesn't talk in detail about this.

You raise some good points. In the early days, many new users thought that Bitcoin would become some kind of alternative Visa system. It turns out that Bitcoin can't compete on that playing field because centralized systems will always win. They scale better, both in terms of volume and number of users. They can be upgraded more quickly. They play well with the banking system.
I think a lot of the disappointment has to do with people not understanding what Bitcoin is. And you can only really understand that by watching how people actually use Bitcoin, rather than listening to what they say they'll use it for.
So here are some thoughts:
1. financial speculation is a use case;
2. censorship-resistant money (think civil asset forfeiture, for example) is a use case;
3. borderless transfer of value is a use case;
4. black market workarounds encompass many use cases;
5. hedging against inflation and other economic shocks is a massive use case;
5. Bitcoin isn't finished being created yet.

Trezor requires an online component to interact with the Bitcoin network. This component determines which chain you'll be using. AFAICT, Trezor hasn't stated a policy on the impending hard fork. A lot of statements were made about phase 1 of 2x (not a hard fork), but not the next phase.


Your coins are safe provided you do absolutely nothing until 2x's fate becomes clear. After 2x activates in mid-November, if you transact without knowing what you're doing, you could lose coins. There are two ways this can happen:
- replays
- wipeouts

A miner varies the nonce to generate a hash value for the block header below the target value. This is the basis of proof-of-work.
Algorithmically, here's the basic idea:
1. Set nonce to zero, compute hash value of block header.
2. Is hash value below target? If so, publish block and claim your block reward/fees.
3. Otherwise, increment nonce, hash block header.
4. Goto 2.
So a miner isn't trying to get a nonce within a range, but rather the block header hash value.
The block body can also be varied, as can the header timestamp.
Here's a visualization of mining:

The root cause of this slo-mo train wreck is the New York Agreement, a document with the seemingly deliberate goal of saying as little as possible in the interest of "consensus."
What was needed instead was a complete technical specification. Only when all the cards are on the table can "consensus" even be considered. Two of the most important things left out of the NYA, and the implementation effort that followed are replay protection and wipeout protection.
Replay protection matters, but wipeout protection is even more critical. SPV users in particular face the very real prospect of losing a lot of money through unstable hash rate majorities on either side of the split.
The only defense will be to run a full node.

Tethering is a good solution. However, tethering means you trust the node you're tethered to. The best option would be to tether to your own full node. There are caveats even to that, unfortunately.


Hardware wallets are sometimes paired to SPV nodes. The main distinction should be between SPV nodes and full nodes.
The only bulletproof option is to use a full node you control. A full node will detect invalid block bodies and therefore is immune to whatever the 2x network decides to throw its way.

Two things. First, LN probably won't be operational by November.
Second, a sudden loss of block space (either by hash rate drop or transaction surge) would prevent channels from being opened or closed. If a channel can't be unilaterally closed in a timely manner, that opens the door to the other party stealing money from the channel.

This is the fundamental problem of Bitcoin governance. There is no way to know:

- what threshold constitutes "we".
Penalties happen after the fact, but there's no reliable measure of what the terms are and who the negotiation is taking place with. Instead, miners do something that angers many Bitcoin users. Those users respond by adopting a hard fork that changes the proof-of-work algorithm. It's punitive, not collaborative.

Yes, in principle. However, how will you know the train is on the right track? How will you know that the danger of being flipped to the other chain is past?
Consider Bitcoin Cash. Its hash rate approaches that of the Bitcoin network at its peak. But it started out at a minuscule level. It was a chain that was declared dead on arrival by many.

If you're using a wallet that supports it, you can use child-pays-for-parent. Create a child transaction that spends one of your outputs, and make sure the child's fee is enough for itself and for the parent.
Electrum will let you do this.
If this doesn't make sense, your best option is to wait. Default timeout is 3 days, which means that it will take around that long before the transaction disappears from enough nodes that you can try again. However, it may confirm by then. Weekends tend to see low tx volumes.

Many people have said the same thing as you. Often "Apple" and "Steve Jobs" are used in place of "Tim Berners-Lee."
The main difference here is that we're talking about public key cryptography controlling money. When you lose your bitcoin by losing your private key, getting it stolen, or sending money into the void - there's no way to get it back. You're hosed.
When you lose your data or time because of a crappy UI, people tend not to care as much.
IMO, the opposite needs to happen. Wallet developers need to end this fiction that the Bitcoin protocol can be hidden from users. Instead, they need to start empowering users by exposing the protocol.
A case in point: fees. Wallets attempting to hide the fact that fees fluctuate lock users into a terrible user experience of either overpaying or underpaying.

Not sure I follow. An SPV wallet need not upgrade to support segwit. From its perspective, a segwit transaction looks like somebody spent an anyone-can-spend transaction.
Ditto for 2x. An SPV wallet can't tell how big blocks are because the header doesn't give that information. Therefore, an SPV wallet connected to only 2x nodes has no reason to reject the headers it's being given.
Either way, an SPV node can continue to work without upgrading. Both positions are consistent AFAICT.

Forks typically occur when two miners generate different blocks with the same parent at roughly the same time.
During the time that your transaction is included on only Fork 1, someone watching only Fork 2 can be tricked into receiving coins you double spend.
If Fork 2 ultimately prevails, all of Fork 1's transactions will be added back to the memory pool for re-confirmation. You are correct - your client doesn't need to re-broadcast the transaction.
This gets confusing because there really isn't one single block chain. Each node keeps its own copy, which can become out-of-step with the others during brief forks. Also, the block chain is really better described as a block tree that branches occasionally for short stretches.
Likewise, there isn't a single memory pool, but rather many memory pools maintained on each node.

You can't. So your node does the validation for itself.


Your node will detect the fraud quite easily.


You can't tamper with a transaction without invalidating its signature. Tampering would also change the ID, which would mean the transaction was no longer part of the original block. The rules are quite strict and cryptographically enforceable.
(The exception is malleability, which changes the ID, but not the purpose or end state of the transaction. However, this only applies to unconfirmed transactions. Confirmed transactions can't be changed in any way.)

The signing algorithm creates mutual transaction incompatibility. Block bodies are therefore invalid. A full node detects this and rejects the block.
However, that change alone leaves Cash headers valid on the Bitcoin network. An SPV wallet would gladly follow the Cash chain if it were stronger.
EDA makes that impossible by causing the block header target field to report an unacceptably high value.
This means that the first few Cash blocks, before EDA kicked in, are valid on the Bitcoin network. It appears to have been an accidental form of strong wipeout protection.

None of the above. Consider the simple question: who pays for network security?
We're still struggling with this question and it comes down to two unappetizing approaches:
1. everyone pays through the block subsidy and inflation of the money base;
2. payers pay through transaction fees.
In 8 years of debating this issue, nobody has come up with a better solution.
(2) means that you can't support everyone's use case because either:
1. blocks need to be full (market fee density is high); or
2. every transaction needs to go onto the block chain (fee density is low, but volume is high).
If (1), hyperbitcoinization is a non-starter because most of the world's population can't afford to make even a single transaction at 500 satoshis/byte.
If (2), the block size is gargantuan and Bitcoin's entire reason for being evaporates: censorship-resistance.
LN is awesome, and I think LN will work. But one thing that's clear at this point is that LN will not work if blocks are full and LN is heavily used. Any burst in on-chain transaction volume would open a window for an attacker to get away with publishing an invalid channel state.
So there will be always be a vocal group in Bitcoin arguing for infinite block space. They're banking on mass adoption to increase aggregate fee revenue. But all they're going to do is create a centralized system that replicates Visa, and the world already has Visa.
So we end up with blocks that have enormous capacity yet which are mostly empty. The block reward relentlessly decreases and miners start to look for alternative sources of revenue - by attacking Bitcoin.
Something needs to be done to secure the network. At that point, there are no options left... other than to maybe raise that block subsidy by just a little bit for now.

That's one way to do a "Sybil" attack, and nothing prevents it.
The fewer nodes there are, the easier it becomes to overwhelm the network with your own clones.
But the power of this attack is limited. You won't be able to get a full node to accept bad blocks. You can only filter blocks. Among other things, this means you could, for example, simulate a soft fork.
But if only one peer remains honest, a node will see the blocks you're censoring and the attack fails.
Although a full node will reject bad block bodies from a Sybil network, an SPV node will accept them because it can't validate block bodies. That makes the consequences of succumbing to a Sybil attack more severe. Your Sybil network can feed a node a stronger but invalid chain and the SPV node will follow it.

I was aware of the block.version=3, but BIP66 seems unrelated to the block size issue:


Maybe I'm misinterpreting the quote, but it seemed to suggest a link between block.version=3 and the block size limit. The BIP makes it clear that this particular double threshold switchover applies to strict signature DER encoding, not the block size limit.
Are the two issues linked?
 &gt;RE: people could lose money: how would people lose money if the maximum block size was increased? Are you talking about miners that refuse to upgrade?
As a node operator (not miner), I didn't get the memo that the block size has been increased and I must update. I continue to use my 0.9.0 node to process payments for my business. Within minutes of the release of the hard fork, a 1.5 MB block is generated. My node rejects it and refuses to accept blocks extending it.
I've been forked off the network. My customers keep sending payments, but my payment system fails to recognize their confirmation. Rebooting my node wipes pending transactions, so I don't even see those. Customers get angry and leave, accusing me of cheating them by not delivering goods when they clearly paid, and posting to forums about what a lousy guy I am. I've just lost money.
Or, I'm doing business with Chuck, who sees what's happening, realizes I haven't updated my node, and knows he can double spend a coin with me. Chuck spends his coin with Transaction A, which ends up on the 1.5 MB branch just after the fork. Then he spends the same coin with me using Transaction B. A single unpatched peer relays Transaction B to me.
Meanwhile I've rebooted my node again given all the recent weird events. I'm only connected to patched nodes this time. With no record of Transaction A in my node's memory pool, and no record of it in the block chain my node considers longest, I accept unconfirmed Transaction B and deliver the goods. I've just lost money.
Edit: I think the second scenario doesn't apply in the form I gave. Patched nodes wouldn't relay Transaction B. However, if an unpatched miner later relays a block containing Transaction B, and I later connected to an unpatched node, that could fool me into accepting Transaction B.
What I'm getting at is that the hard fork effectively creates two networks: one for patched nodes and the other for unpatched nodes. This creates some attack routes and ways to confuse users that don't normally exist. That can lead to loss of money.

Another method is to draw cards from a shuffled, standard 52-card deck. You'll want to work out the math for how many cards to draw is enough. Pick an encoding for each card, for example, "AH", "10S", "3C", "QD", etc. Record the hash value of the entire sequence, which becomes your private key.

Bitcoin could end up making life miserable for venture capitalists. It sure *seems* like there's a lot of money to be made by investing in companies doing Bitcoin-related stuff. Reality could work out differently, though, especially if Bitcoin succeeds on a large scale.
History has repeatedly shown the inherent conflict between Bitcoin and centralized services. Still, the goal of any company is to establish a product or service under its control, and charge users for the privilege of using it. Ideally, this product or service would be unique (i.e., a monopoly), as Peter Thiel likes to point out.
Take BitPay for example. Scroll down the home page ( and you'll find this:


Those highfalutin words are code for government-mandated collection of private information. Bitcoin's privacy model depends on a strict separation between user identity and public keys. Using BitPay gives a single organization the power to link the identities of a large fraction of all users to at least some of their public keys.
Coinbase takes this one step further by harvesting information from users entering (buying bitcoin) and exiting (merchant checkout) the Bitcoin economy. A company capable of doing this at scale can read the block chain in a way that would likely shock and possibly anger many users.
Decentralized, user-friendly solutions are feasible, but will take time to develop. The continued evolution of decentralized options will put pressure on the profit margins of those companies that decide to compete through centralized services.
Xapo ( is mentioned in the article. Its vault service is a response to the technical difficulty of secure bitcoin storage. But if better solutions to this technical problem emerge, the need for bank-like storage (and the fees that go with it) will fade.
Wallets seem like a central access point ripe for establishing a beachhead. Indeed, many Bitcoin companies offer wallets. However, wallet security failures have highlighted the importance of source code availability, open review, and community involvement. There are ways to make money from open source software, but that usually means selling a complementary product or service. The money-making complement to an open source wallet is far from clear.
Bitcoin companies that become very profitable may look very little like the companies that investors are used to taking a stake in. Bitcoin may even be fundamentally incompatible with traditional value-added financial products and services. And that means a lot of smart people will lose money.

Visa processed 141 billion transactions in 2016 (up 41% from 2015):
That's 386 million per day (141 billion / 365) or 16.0 million per hour (386 million / 24) or 2.68 million per 10-minute interval (16 million / 6).
Let's be optimistic and assume that a transaction averages 250 bytes. One block of data would require 670 MB.
There are about ~~5100~~ 53,000 (144\*365) blocks in a year, which totals up to ~~3.4 petabytes~~ 35 terabytes (53000\*0.67 GB). Not only would this rate of data capture need to be matched, but so would Visa's growth rate (which appears to be in the double-digits).

Naming based on chain strength raises the question of what happens in the event that hash rate flip-flops - perhaps a few times.
Far worse than naming confusion is chain identity confusion. How will users ever know for sure what chain they're about to transact on when the title "Bitcoin" goes to the "chain with the most accumulated difficulty," and that title can swing back and forth like a pendulum?
The only sane move here is to either:

While I'd like to think that Coinbase's security will never be breached and that the reams of customer data it's collected will always be safe, the realist in me says otherwise.
A big data breach at Coinbase would be disastrous for Bitcoin users because the entire transaction graph would become an open book not of pseudonyms, but real identities. This may not happen for years, but it doesn't matter. The block chain records everything.

It would be very difficult to do this securely. You'd have to find a way to communicate which of the words in the rap were used in the mnemonic sentence, and their exact order.
This is actually a variation on the brain wallet technique of choosing every nth word from a book passage - the Bible for example. An attacker who learns the pattern can bypass the brute force approach. The other problem is that you'll forget the pattern, losing your funds for good.
Brain wallets are really, really hard to generate securely when a human is in charge of picking the source of entropy.

That's one attack. There are others as well.
If you use an SPV wallet, the WiFi operator could try to lie to you about whether or not other transactions have been confirmed or are pending confirmation.
For example, the WiFi operator could attempt to double spend with you by hiding one of his past transactions from you. Your SPV wallet would have no way to detect the omission.
However, the WiFi operator can't* change your transaction in a meaningful way.
There's a (*) because one thing that can be done by the WiFi operator or anyone else who gets your transaction before it's confirmed is to mutate it in a way that doesn't change its overall meaning, but can cause subtle problems:
That won't make much difference in the majority of cases. However, it may confuse you/your wallet, and will cause problems with certain kinds of Contracts. Fixes to the Malleability problem are in the works.

The author offers little evidence that micropayments would motivate good scientists to contribute public, post-publication reviews. It's a problem worth solving, but this idea comes up short.
Scientists publish for one reason: prestige. Scientific prestige is a currency that be converted into money - potentially lots of it. Grant approvals, promotions, positive tenure decisions, and even job interviews all flow from the right level of prestige. Prestige is also useful in its own right to get meetings that otherwise wouldn't happen, for example.
Today, scientists gain prestige by publishing in prestigious journals and speaking at prestigious conferences. These transactions rarely involve the author getting paid. In many cases, the author pays for the privilege.
The real problem has nothing to do with direct monetary compensation for writing reviews. The real problem is how to make it prestigious to do so. This proposal fails to address the issue.

Yes, someone can generate the same seed mnemonic sentence as you, if you generate it non-randomly. For example, if you pick your own words from the word list, you're asking for trouble because your brain is a very bad random number generator.
Here is the BIP 39 English word list:
There are 2048 words, each one of which can be represented by 11 bits (2048 = 2^11). Using a 12-word sentence gives 132 bits of entropy. However, the last four bits are a checksum to prevent transcription errors. That gives 128 bits of entropy.
In other words, the number of BIP 39 master private keys using this scheme is 2^128, or 3.4x10^38. That number of combinations is generally regarded as immune to brute force attack.

A double spend is two transactions, A and B, that spend the same coin.
There are two somewhat practical ways to try doing it:
1. A Race Attack sends A and B to different nodes simultaneously. Each node accepts the transaction because it doesn't see the counterpart. Clients with different memory pool policies will be vulnerable to this attack. For example: 
2. A Finney Attack sends A to the network, but only after secretly mining B into a block. A goes into the memory pool, tricking the merchant into releasing the goods. The block containing B is then released, invalidating A. Much less practical due to the need to be able to mine a block competitively. 
A third method, Majority Hash Rate Attack, is only practical for those with access to massive amounts of hashing power. In other words, it isn't practical for very many people. Attacker gets A confirmed. Then, using majority status, mines a chain of blocks long enough to overtake the block with A. Adding a new block with B invalidates A, completing the double spend.
This attack works with 100% success given &gt;50% of the network hash rate, but with less chance of success given &lt;50% of the network hash rate.

Makes sense. That's already effectively the purpose of the 1 satoshi/byte relay fee. Extending this idea to allow the relay fee to float would solve the "Crash Landing" problem raised here:


This makes much less sense. The article raises two points in support of random selection over fee-based selection:
1. It's simpler to eject random transactions than ejecting them based on fee density.
2. Each node will pick a different random transaction, meaning that random selection just means lower effective propagation for everyone's transactions during a DoS.
Regarding (1), generating nodes using Core already sort transactions by fee density to create a candidate block. It's a mechanism already built into Bitcoin Core. It's far from clear what source of complexity the author envisions in sorting as opposed to random selection.
Point (2) degrades the experience for all users, regardless of the fee they pay. What will Bitcoin users be told to do when their transactions take longer overall to confirm, regardless of the fee they use?
Sorting by fee sends a clear message: when the freeway backs up, the express lane toll goes up, but that lane will always be clear. Maybe I'm missing something, but random selection has the effect of breaking the link between fees and confirmation time - unnecessarily.

One of Bitcoin's most persistent criticisms is that hard money is bad for an economy in that it discourages consumption and encourages "hoarding" of money.
I don't agree with this. You don't agree with this. But Joe Sixpack probably agrees with this - otherwise he would elect leaders who would stop inflating the money supply through deficit spending, QE, and lax regulatory enforcement.
And hyperbitcoinization (the premise of this thread) is only possible if Joe Sixpack is on board.
There's another thing about Joe Sixpack. He doesn't want to pay for anything. He hates, really hates, the idea of transaction fees. He will support almost any initiative that can eliminate fees.
There's an easy way to eliminate transaction fees: ensure that block space supply always exceeds demand. But that could really cut into fee revenue, especially if the outrage against fees means that literally no fees will be tolerated ever. But securing the network requires money from somewhere. Fortunately, there is a big pot of... bitcoin just for that purpose.
Over 80% of the 21 million supply has already been paid in subsidies. By 2022, that goes up to over 90%:
One sure-fire way to keep the miners happy is to continue (or accelerate) the flow of block subsidies. The former leads to &gt;21 million bitcoin; the latter leads to exhaustion of the subsidy ahead of schedule and a crisis.
But I'm sure Joe Sixpack wouldn't care either way.

Which part(s) of the second bullet point do you disagree with? Script/contracts weren't mentioned in the white paper? Or that he didn't write much about them?


I'm disagreeing with the tactic of using things that Satoshi rarely discussed as the basis for concluding what the aims of the project were. All we have is the white paper and forum posts. Some things he wrote on were recurring themes, but others were more obscure and one-off.
Edit: After thinking about it, maybe the source code itself should be considered a statement of project goals. Perhaps, but it's very hard to judge. The first release of Bitcoin contained a market of some kind (market.cpp), but I don't think anyone views Bitcoin's main goal as building an online marketplace. Interpreting the intent of source code can be difficult at best.
The only thing any of us who aren't Satoshi and don't have access to private communications with him can do is read what was written and try to conclude based on frequency and emphasis what was seen as most important.
Ultimately, his views don't matter though because the entire project has moved on in some ways that were very difficult to predict at the time. Which was the point I was trying to make.

@_date: 2015-09-02 16:20:06


When you make a transaction, you're unlocking a coin (unspent tx output) that was previously locked, and then you're relocking it. You're working with a "solid" money metaphor - just like physical coins and bank notes.
The "liquid" money metaphor is how banks and credit cards work. You transfer a balance from one account to another, without using tokens.
This creates confusion because people expect Bitcoin to work like "liquid" money - transfers from one account to another. Then they run smack into change addresses, and other things that don't match their faulty mental models. This results in loss of money and worse.
It's the wallets causing the problems with their leaky abstractions, not the protocol.


The protocol defines no such concept as "account."


Digital coin value can be combined and split, as the white paper makes clear.
Imagine a system of money based on gold lumps. To make a transaction, you go through a bizarre ritual of melting the lumps you're about to spend together, then casting new lumps for your payee and yourself. That's essentially how a transaction works.
So I'll concede the analogy isn't perfect, but thinking of balances and accounts will only lead to trouble.

It's a new way to achieve most of the same goals. Because the idea is new, permissioned ledgers may have properties with advantages over existing options. For example, simplicity of design. Transparency might be another useful feature.
This is probably the reason that most of what's been going on has been clearly labeled as "experimental." The experiment might show no advantage whatsoever.

One major property does differentiate an electronic coin from a physical coin in my mind. A digital coin has no physical representation. Of course, it's a pretty significant feature, but can behave like a bug.
Everything else, including fixed face value, limited supply, forgery resistance, transferability, durability, etc. applies equally to digital coins and physical coins.


I'm not sure how that relates to my comment.


The title of the white paper seems to suggest otherwise.

You can create an invoice chain.
Each invoice references the SHA-256 has value of the previous invoice. Then you timestamp each invoice by embedded its hash value in OP_RETURN data.
Security could be improved by signing each invoice with a well-known public key before hashing it.
Timestamping gives you the earliest date at which a fact was known, but it can't give you the latest date. For example, you could accumulate a bunch of invoices, wait a year, then start publishing one per week and nobody would be able to tell that you've been sitting on them for awhile.

In mid-2011 Hacker News ran a story about a JavaScript miner that could be used to monetize sites. I believe it was this one:
It was the 3rd or 4th time I had seen a story about Bitcoin. Instead of discounting Bitcoin yet again, I decided to dig deeper. Clearly I was missing something important if smart people kept yammering on about this thing.
For kicks, I decided to try buying a small amount of bitcoin. Turned out to be a research project in itself. I scoured the Bitcoin Talk forum looking for sellers that looked the least scammy. I sent one an email, and we agreed on the details of the transaction.
I would send him a Western Union transfer (my first and only one) and he would send me some bitcoin. IIRC, no exchange rate was part of the deal; s/he would just give me an amount of bitcoin that seemed fair. I expected to receive nothing so the rate didn't seem to matter much.
A few days later, I was shocked to get an email saying the transfer had been made. I started up Bitcoin-Qt to see that I was the owner of some bitcoin.
It turns out I had bought at the very peak of the 2011 spike. In the months that followed I watched the value of my investment nosedive by over 90%.
I never sold those coins. However, successive system upgrades and several near-losses of wallets taught me that I didn't know squat about Bitcoin security or even how Bitcoin worked.
That was the start of a very long process of unlearning what I knew about electronic payments and understanding how Bitcoin worked.

I've found it helpful to abandon the idea of anonymity and think about privacy instead.
Privacy is the ability of a group or individual to selectively reveal information about itself. When you think about it this way, privacy is the safekeeping of information. It's just another form of security.
Few people care about anonymity, but many care about privacy. Bitcoin users can keep a lot of privacy, but they have to adopt practices consistent with that goal.

It goes back to the white paper.


This is an idea known as "chain of ownership." A coin's ownership history can be traced all the way back to the "coinbase" transaction that created it.
When you give me a transaction, I'm keenly interested in knowing if the chain of ownership is valid. If the chain is broken or tampered with, your coin is bogus. To determine that I need access to all transactions, or there are likely to be gaps.
The second reason is double spending. You can give me a perfectly valid coin that you've already spent. Without a record of all transactions, I have no way to know if the coin you're giving me has already been spent.

Beyond scalability, Bitcoin faces ongoing usability issues. Consumers simply aren't used to the idea that losing a secret means permanent loss of their money, or that there is essentially no recourse in the event of theft.

An address is derived from a 160-bit hash value. That's 2^160 possible addresses, or 10^48.
You generate an address from a randomly-chosen private key and I'll start generating addresses at a rate of 1 billion/second. 10^29 centuries from now I will have generated them all.
All of this falls apart when you generate addresses using a private key you choose, as in many brain wallets. For example, you find the SHA-256 hash value of the phrase "to the moon" and use it to derive your address. Within a few hours I'll have your private key and address.
There are many cases of this kind of brain wallet disaster - for example:

A hard fork update requires the active participation of all node operators who want to join the new network. If sufficient political support for the update can't be mustered, then the new network will be weak and easily attacked.
Only hard fork updates with widespread, near unanimous support, have any chance of making it. History has born this out in that only one hard fork update has ever succeeded, and it was remarkable in that opposition to it was absent due to the aftermath of an existential crisis (chain split March 2013).

Bitcoin is not a mature technology. Unfortunately, many proponents act as if it were.
Mature technologies are invisible. Users rarely, if ever, stop to think about how they work.
As suggests, the Internet is a mature technology used by billions and very few stop to think about how it all works. Your automatic transmission is another example. That metal tube you flew in to go on your last vacation is still another mature technology.
All of these mature technologies started out as toys with questionable utility and safety.
Bitcoin is not mature because using Bitcoin can cause you harm with a high rate of success unless you know what you're doing. You can lose money. You can lose privacy. You can lose both - permanently and without warning.
Bitcoin doesn't map well to previous experience with electronic payments. Yet new users bring their faulty mental models with them when they begin exploring Bitcoin - sometimes with disastrous results.

signed a message with the private key for one of the addresses, proving he's the one who made the transactions.
Revealing this kind of information makes it easier to track his future financial activities and those he transacts with. Even though he may have used a throwaway, there are still useful bits of information to be gleaned.
The only reasons that come to mind for publicly announcing like this are:
1. Avoid panicking the market by making it clear that Satoshi isn't selling his coins.
2. Exercise well-deserved bragging rights.
3. ???
Regarding (1), the thought occurs that could be Satoshi.
Any comments on any of these points, ?
Edit: it appears that the signature was made with the private key controlling an address to which the coins were relocked, not, as I originally though with a private key controlling the address to which the original 2009 coinbase transaction was locked.

Yes. But you might want to consider the question of whether you've worked through every alternative.
You're trying to defend yourself against an attacker obtaining private keys controlling a large amount of money.
If the attacker can't get to those keys, your money will be safe - provided that you can get to those keys.
As says, you can divide your money into two pots: one for spending and one for savings. The spending pot only has walking around money. The saving pot has the majority of your assets. Protect the savings pot with cold storage. More here:
One thing to watch out for. If the online component of your cold storage wallet has malware, you may have a man-in-the-middle exploit that converts Bitcoin addresses you type or paste with addresses controlled by the attacker. This could trick you into sending money to the wrong destination. However, this attack applies no matter what method of storage you're using.
The advantage of cold storage is that it gives you a couple of extra steps to detect the error.
One alternative is to use a temporary operating system that forgets everything between sessions. Tails is an example of that. It can be used for both the online and offline component of a cold storage wallet. It has the added benefit of using Tor, which increases your privacy.

The number of confirmations doesn't really help here because what you really need is:
1. cryptographic proof of a valid chain-of-ownership
2. a bounded system whereby you can prove a negative (that no other transaction exists that spends the same coin as the one you received).
Confirmation count does help in ensuring that a given active chain (path through a block tree) has the more proof-of-work than any other. But that's a slightly different problem.

Disagree on this point. There are coins, but they are not physical. They are digital (digital tokens). "Coin" is the one bit of branding that Bitcoin actually got right.
It's a shame that so many wallets fall over themselves to hide this useful fact from the user. *That's* the branding problem, and it leads to security and privacy issues.

If this is the goal, the stress tests have been unsuccessful. After each one, the backlog clears and various groups respond to prepare for the next one.
What I've observed during the stress tests is:
- transaction fees go up
- users of wallets with hardcoded tx fees face indefinite confirmation delays
- gets flooded with posts from users asking why their transactions are stuck and what to do about it
- zero-confirmation double spending becomes much easier
- Electrum and Mycelium servers start groaning under the weight
- users look for tools to estimate the going transaction fee density
- users who outbid others by paying higher transaction fees will get next-block confirmation
Increasing the block size limit solves none of these problems. It may may make the attack more expensive, but the end result will be the same.
The lesson I take from these stress tests is that Bitcoin users need a better understanding of what an unconfirmed transaction represents, given that nodes' memory pools are so easily manipulated.
And wallet makers need to give users better tools for either preventing stuck transactions or clearing them when they happen.

The connection between the two isn't entirely clear, but could go something like this.
Within five years, the block subsidy will drop to 6.25 BTC/block. At today's exchange rate, the block subsidy will be a mere 25% of what it is today.
Unless some fundamental changes take place in mining, few miners will remain after such drops. Yet the network must be secured against majority hash rate attackers.
The only thing currently available to take the place of the missing revenue is transaction fees. But those would have to be much higher than today to make up for the missing revenue. One way to do that is to preserve the current block size limit.
There's another angle. The technical difference between increasing the block size limit and increasing the money supply cap is practically insignificant. Both are hard forks. The former has proven divisive today, and the latter would probably prove divisive in the future.
Politically, the two issues are very different (at least today), but that may not always be true.

Which part of consensus are you trying to explain?
I find it very helpful to start with the basics - electronic cash:
When you understand electronic cash, including chain of ownership and why that's useful, you understand the double spending problem, and the need for the solution that the Bitcoin network provides.
Start with a single auditor who keeps a record of all transactions. Solves the problem, but creates a single point of failure.
Add another auditor and a mechanism for relaying transactions between them. Removes the central point of failure, but introduces the need to keep the same list of transactions in the same order, even though Delays and coincidences ensure that transactions will cross paths when being relayed from time to time.
Introduce proof of work to slow down the rate of transaction relay between auditors. Unfortunately, this severely limits transaction throughput. Introduce blocks to hold multiple transactions and a memory pool to hold unconfirmed transactions.
Great, except proof of work cost money. Auditors need compensation or they won't work. Introduce block reward and transaction fees. The nice thing is block reward also solves the problem of how new money gets injected into the system fairly.
You'll notice that this order of explanation leaves the block subsidy at the very end. - where it belongs.
The only real world analogy I've found that holds at any level of resolution is electronic cash. The rest fall apart on closer inspection, forcing the student to abandon the old working model entirely. It's something that some are not able to do which leads to much confusion as bad mental models continue to be used.

Edit: if this doesn't work, it may be your fee density is too low. Cointape indicates that you'll need to pay about 40 satoshis/byte to get next-block confirmation:
Estimating based on your screenshot, the tx you sent looks like it paid only ~4 satoshis/byte. So it could be the fee was set too low. In that case your options are to wait (usually works, and the only option that should be used by a beginner), or try to unstick your transaction. More here:
Edit2: Looks like Cointape just updated to a more reasonable-looking fee schedule. So simply republishing your transaction should do the trick.

Bitcoin could end up being a VC's worst nightmare: a technology that seems poised to change the world, yet which defies most attempts at direct monetization.
Bitcoin really offers two main value propositions at the moment, and they're connected:
1. Money without government.
2. Censorship resistance.
If your company aligns with these values through its products and services, then it can profit.
If your company compromises either of these two values, it will probably face a long, grinding road no matter how many tens of millions it raises.
It's pretty clear that Joe Sixpack Firstworld doesn't care about Bitcoin and probably never will. He's over-served by existing financial services. He knows if his card number is stolen that he won't pay a dime. The only payment he ever receives is a paycheck, and he's never used Western Union or a wire transfer. He thinks that those who have done nothing wrong have nothing to hide. Financial news stories whiz by and there's temporary interest, followed by business as usual.
BitPay's mistake was thinking that Bitcoin was about something else, and more importantly *for* someone else than it actually is. It's a hard lesson likely to be learned by others in the space before too long.

I like the idea of thinking about why people "hire Bitcoin." It follows nicely from work Clay Christensen has done using the same idea known as "milkshake marketing:"
There are two economically important reasons people hire Bitcoin:
1. Monetary sovereignty, as the interview discusses.
2. Censorship resistance.
Anybody who cares about either of these issues should have no problem hiring Bitcoin.
This is a potentially useful filter thought which a lot of unworkable ideas will not pass. Just because it's technically cool doesn't mean it's going to help Bitcoin succeed as a product.
Oddly enough, those two points above are the main cause of the "smell" Bitcoin has in the public mind. Better for Bitcoin to keep its smell, and even accentuate it, than for Bitcoin to become lost in a sea of unremarkable services.

Two seemingly unrelated situations may work together in weird ways in the coming years:
1. Negative interest rates, which encourage savers to pull bank deposits and put them elsewhere.
2. The war on drugs/terror, in which banks close or refuse accounts to "suspicious" customers, including gamblers, whistleblowers, cannabis shops, vape stores, publishers, etc. Cash transactions are the only alternative for these folks.
It's not always easy to see where Bitcoin offers a compelling use case to people living in rich countries. Given that the above situations aren't merely flukes, but the start of long term trends, this could change.

Does the analysis take into account the prevailing next block transaction fee density?
@_date: 2015-09-10 01:32:23


Maybe, but I don't see how.
As I understand the idea behind random selection, when an XT node's mempool reaches a pre-set number of transactions, a random transaction will be selected for ejection, along with any ancestors and descendants. The whole chain will then be dumped.
This random selection process will happen independently across XT nodes. If every node on the network ran XT, the effect would be for a given transaction to spontaneously disappear on a small percentage of nodes.
The net effect is to reduce the effective propagation for that transaction, which may have paid fees higher than any other in the node's mempool.
The way this idea penalizes low and high fee density transaction alike is puzzling. However, if I'm reading 's statement correctly, this randomness could be useful as a DoS prevention measure.

Currently, fees run about 100 satoshis/byte for next-block confirmation:
The more unspent outputs you add to the transaction, the more bytes are required and the higher your fee.
A 100 K transaction (the maximum as of last year  = 100,000 bytes. This would require a fee of 10,000,000 satoshis (100,000 bytes * 100 satoshis/byte), or 0.1 BTC.

Here's more on this underreported topic:
To summarize, SPV wallets only look a block headers. 2x headers will look perfectly valid. It's the block bodies that will be invalid.
The header doesn't encode the block size - that must be determined from the block body. And obtaining full block bodies is exactly what the SPV wallet avoids doing to boost performance.
In other words, an SPV wallet will blindly follow the longest chain, even if it's invalid.

Something doesn't make sense here. Increasing the block size limit is a hard fork. Depending on who you talk to, a hard fork has never happened before.

You must run a full node. Perhaps counterintuitively, this makes securing the server generating the payment addresses very important. Although an attacker can't steal money already payed to you, s/he can divert payments from you by adding his/her own key pairs to your deterministic key pool.

I've had similar experiences trying to pay at merchants who "take bitcoin." Over time, staff forget how to take payments, or turnover effectively does the same thing. Calling ahead to verify that the merchant still accepts bitcoin is no guarantee that they will actually be capable of accepting payment.
My working hypothesis is that the problems run deeper than many realize. Bitcoin is hardly used at all after the initial rush of publicity fades. Not only is it awkward to use in person, but dealing with the accounting and tax implications of holding bitcoin is very difficult. Coinbase and BitPay can smooth some of that out, but then what's the actual point? The merchant is using a roundabout way to take dollars.
Projections for the number of bitcoin-accepting merchants should take this high attrition rate into account.

Then you are way ahead of the game compared to many users - good.
As pointed out, that many inputs is going to kill you with fees.
Here's a article explaining fees in (possibly too much) depth:
It has a handy rule of thumb formula for computing transaction size (required to estimate fee).
    s = 10 + 148×n + 34×t, ±n
where *s* is size, *n* is number of inputs, and *t* is number of outputs.
Size is multiplied by market fee density (about 150 satoshis/byte ATM) to give the fee you'll pay. As you can see, the largest effect on fee is the input count. You can reduce your fee by reducing the input count.

You might have a look here:
The short answer is: you're going to sign a transaction with your private key. The unsigned transaction is created on a computer with network access. The signature is generated on a computer without network access.
Under this system, the private key never needs to leave the computer lacking network access. This does, however, require a way to move transactions between the offline and online computers. This is often done with thumb drives, but other methods can also be used.
The mathematical linkage between private and public key ensures that the signed transaction will be accepted by the network.

How does this discussion about authentication apply to my original comment? At issue is mental models and how well/poorly they map onto the protocol. Not authentication.


Transactions reassign the ownership of one or more coins, creating one or more coins in the process. Satoshi didn't invent this idea, he got it from previous work on electronic cash. Nevertheless, this is the system we have with Bitcoin.
My original point is that hiding this fact from users can lead to confusion and problems. The name "Bitcoin" brings this issue front and center, which is a good thing.

Great interview. A couple of thoughts.
I believe the phrase missing from the middle of the interview was "censorship resistance." Nick gave the example of the Russian sanctions, the costs for Visa to comply with them, and how Bitcoin sidesteps the issue. He also mentioned this idea, without using the term "censorship resistance", as Bitcoin's defining quality. In other words, if you don't care about censorship resistance, then why use Bitcoin at all? Stick to Visa.
The interview returned to this topic near the end during the block size limit discussion. It was implied that increasing block size without taking all of the implications for censorship resistance into account was a mistake. To do so was to lose sight of what makes Bitcoin unique and valuable in the first place.
I'm not sure about characterizing XT as an attack, but thinking of the goals of that project as valuing transactions-per-second above censorship resistance seems like a good way to think about the philosophical divide.

They generally choose to build on the block that:
- has the most proof-of-work;
- was seen first in the event of a proof-of-work tie.

For one thing, controlling a significant amount of money from a bc.i wallet on a phone can lead to very bad things to naive users who dive in head-first.
Securing large sums of money (as would be necessary if bitcoin were a global currency) requires a system considerably more complex than bc.i.

Not at all. The overarching goal was to create a peer-to-peer electronic cash system. That's the topic the white paper deals with almost exclusively. Satoshi wrote a lot about the concept. The idea of electronic cash is deeply embedded into Bitcoin.
But many other goals have been pursued at various times by various people. For example:
- Brick-and-mortar transactions didn't get a lot of attention in Bitcoin's early days. The focus was on enabling online payments.
- Script and the kinds of contracts they can enable, major innovations, weren't even mentioned in the white paper, nor did Satoshi write much about them publicly.
- Tokenization of digital assets using the block chain was actually rejected by Satoshi when the idea was pitched in the form of what turned into Namecoin.
- Using the block chain as a general-purpose timestamping mechanism only came up after Bitcoin had been in use for several months, and then only in passing.
The point is that these other uses only became possible after the electronic cash problem was solved. They weren't part of the original vision as expressed publicly. That doesn't, however, detract from their legitimacy.
What I find less than helpful is when people go digging into old forum posts to find obscure quotes as support for a claim that this or that idea was part of Satoshi's original vision.
The original vision was simple, and clear: peer-to-peer electronic cash. The rest are innovations built on that original vision.

to commodity positions generally apply. Counterintuitively,
bitcoin transactions are as unique as physical stock certificates, which means the default identification rule of the §1012 regulations is likely to be actual delivery; however, this will often not apply
to an owner who uses a hosted wallet, and does not
control his private keys.

Censorship resistance and high transaction volume involve some mutually incompatible goals.
For censorship resistance, you want to maximize the simplicity of running a node, and minimize the corresponding resource requirements. If a bully comes along and starts twisting arms to censor, say, transactions to Russian exchanges, gambling sites, or politically sensitive causes, new nodes can be deployed to route around the problem.
The harder it is to run a node, and this is a direct function of the size of the block chain, the easier it is to twist enough arms to censor a class of transactions off the network. To prevent this, you want to restrict the growth of the block chain as much as possible,
To maximize transaction volume, you need the block chain to grow with as few restrictions as possible. You want capacity to always exceed demand. You want fees as low as possible to encourage widespread adoption.
Two very different views of what Bitcoin is all about and what makes it special. And each view place mutually incompatible requirements on the underlying technology.
You can have a Bitcoin that resists censorship or which supports high transaction volumes. But nobody has proposed a way to fit both visions into the same system in a way that works today.
I've heard the argument that the best way to ensure censorship resistance is to ensure widespread (universal) adoption. It's hard to clamp down on something everyone is already doing. But to get to those levels of adoption and transaction volume from where we are now is a long, winding road. We're talking years, if not decades. All that time, the block chain continues to grow, along with the expertise and resources needed to run a full node. It's a race with no clear outcome.

It seems like this attack would work best against a network in which low fee density transactions are ejected deterministically, but not on a network in which nodes kicked out random transactions.

I'm not sure how to do it securely, but it certainly seems possible to have censorship-resistant transactions using some technology other than block chains.
By requiring every auditor to pass through a rigorous vetting process and use a well-known key to sign blocks, you can achieve distributed consensus without censorship resistance.
I'm not saying either of these outcomes are optimal or desirable - simply that they're possible.
For that matter, it's not even clear that you can have censorship resistance over the long term with Bitcoin. Mining centralization gets in the way of that, and is increasing.

I haven't seen much really good information about this. Here's the best I could find:
The upgrade itself should be relatively simple. It's everything else that goes with it because we're talking about a consensus network that could prove problematic.
AFAICT, replacing the signature algorithm itself (OP_CHECKSIG) would require a hard fork update because new behavior (a new kind of signature) would be allowed.
However, it should be possible to add a new signature type through a soft fork by re-defining an unassigned opcode. That would allow new and old signature schemes to co-exist. At some point, the old secp256k1 signature scheme could be deprecated by nodes refusing to accept blocks using it.

"Dust" means that you tried to create an output (coin) with too little value. So the transaction was rejected as invalid.
Each node sets its own dust limit, but it typically works out to 3x the minimum fee to get the transaction confirmed:
For a 1 satoshi/byte limit, that works out to 1209 satoshis for your transaction (403 bytes). Given that you have P2SH scripts (addresses that start with "3") and 3 output, this size looks reasonable.
Your first output's value is 500 satoshis, which  would be below the limit.
The fee is very high. Be sure you're using the latest version of Electrum. Setting the Fee at ~ 5-10 satoshis/byte (way less than your current 204 satoshis/byte) should get you quick confirmation under current conditions:
To solve the problem, I would try creating a new transaction in which all outputs are &gt; 5000 satoshis (0.00005 BTC) and the Fee is 10 satoshis/byte.

That's a very good question. Any investor should know their exit point before taking a position.

At that point there would be very little upward potential. Converting Bitcoin to some other asset class would be the only rational choice.
Even if such a scenario came to pass, the road there would not be for the faint of heart. Having been through three major nuclear winters in Bitcoin, I would not be surprised to see a half dozen more.
In other words, the sell signal isn't a price, but rather a state of popular mind.

Bitcoin is useful because it offers two related value propositions at the same time:
1. Censorship resistance.
2. Money without government.
Some will cite "decentralization", but this is only a means to an end. And that end is censorship resistance.
Bitcoin's enablement of money without government is important because every attempt to do it so far has concentrated power into few hands, increasing the ability to censor transactions. And the desire to censor seems to increase exponentially with the power to do it.
By bringing these two value propositions into the same system, Bitcoin has unleashed something truly new and empowering into the world.
We strengthen Bitcoin by delivering on these value propositions. We weaken Bitcoin by diminishing them.

Disagree. The biggest problem is that bitcoin is too hard to use. I'm not talking about hiring someone else (Coinbase) to use bitcoin for you. I'm talking about securing your own private keys and financial privacy. And I'm talking about doing that with a large percentage of your life savings. Hardware wallets are nice, but they are no silver bullet. Before you can even get to the point of evaluating a hardware wallet and using it intelligently, you need to know a lot about cryptography and how Bitcoin works.
As evidence, I'd point to the half-dozen very high profile losses at exchanges that people who should have known better were using like bank accounts (minus deposit insurance). I'd also point to the numerous cases of users locking themselves out of current/future large sums of money by making simple crypto mistakes:
This is why alternatives such as Ethereum don't interest me much. They'll all suffer from exactly the same usability problems as Bitcoin. In many ways, it's the same problem as PGP, but with the added dimension of losing major amounts of money.
People have not had enough time to get good at digital security. So they farm it out to others... with disastrous consequences.
This is not to disparage Bitcoin - all new technologies have essentially the same problem: they're too hard to use safely and effectively. And this is what throttles mass adoption more than network effect.
@_date: 2015-11-13 16:00:12
Although I agree that censorship-resistance is the main distinguishing feature of Bitcoin, this does lead to an apparent conflict.
"Onboarding" requires close contact with the established financial sector. We've seen the kinds of problems this can lead to. Bank-like institutions are compelled to act like extensions of power-hungry governments, serving as foot-soldiers in ongoing conflicts with individuals and other organizations around the world.
The longer this period of financial onboarding takes, the greater the risk of censorship in the form of closing down access points or restricting them to the point of uselessness.
So a follow-up question might be: "how long is the runway, and what can be done to ensure it's long enough?"

In a nutshell:


Satoshi can be usefully referenced when discussing things like the white paper, terminology, and initial project goals. The creator of a project always gets to name things and stake out the broad vision.

The main difference is that the world is awash in methods for moving value, access to which can be revoked swiftly and without warning.
Decentralization isn't free, as the lengthy fight about the block size limit demonstrates. We put up with the hassle because of one unbeatable value proposition: no matter how hated an individual or group becomes, the network can't censor their transactions.

Or sidechains could stimulate expansion of the per-transaction fee. This is an idea your analysis ignores, but it's worth considering.
Bitcoin has bad properties for use in physical merchant settings. Confirmation time of 10 minutes (+/- one hour) and very simple zero-confirmation double spending attacks work together to make the merchant's life difficult (not to mention severe ongoing usability issues for merchant and consumer).
No matter how high we set the block size, your coffee isn't going onto the block chain if that's what everyone decides to do (and it won't be).
But a payment network designed for fast confirmation, and backed by the Bitcoin block chain, could be more attractive to consumers and merchants. A single on-chain transaction might represent thousands bitcoin in off-chain transactions, in which case a fee of an entire bitcoin would be less than 0.1%. Twenty-five of those transactions alone covers the current subsidy.
I'm not saying this is a desirable outcome. A fee of one bitcoin for a thousand bytes would all but assure that ordinary people are not using Bitcoin directly anymore.
However, your idea that off-chain transactions suck revenue from mining has a hole in it.

Most of its uses and potential uses fall outside of convention:

- a medium of exchange for those denied use of credit cards, debit cards, and checking accounts
- divisible to much smaller units than fiat currency, enabling micropayment schemes in principle
- programmable money that empowers people who don't know each other to create digitally-enforced contracts
- transportable to any other person anywhere else in the world, regardless of whether a state condones it, 24/7
There are others. The point is that most people don't have these needs and so won't see Bitcoin's value. A lot of the speculation has to do with the idea that over time these and other uses will start to be perceived as increasingly valuable by a larger segment of the world population.

If you mean the "instant" payments part, I'm not so sure. RBF leaves these competitive advantages intact:
- censorship resistance
- difficult to double spend a confirmed transaction
- algorithmically controlled money supply (mostly)
Maybe this is the heart of the issue. Those who view RBF as no big deal look to points like those above as Bitcoin's strongest competitive advantages.
Those who see RBF as a threat look to a different set of compelling advantages and use cases. I'm pessimistic these will ever play an important role in the Bitcoin economy because VISA, PayPal, and others have pretty much nailed the "instant" payment market, at least among the world's richest people. Others (such as m-pesa) are making good inroads to solving the same problem for the world's poorest.

Another reason that a transaction becomes stuck is that it contains dust: an output too small to allow propagation of the transaction.

Regardless of whether anyone considers this use case important enough to accept into Bitcoin Core, the real issue remains:
These memory pool schemes are trying to enforce good behavior on a very flimsy foundation.
The blockchain provides a solid mathematical foundation for dealing with double spending. Zero-confirmation transactions not at all.
If we could reliably prevent double spending of unconfirmed transactions, we wouldn't need the block chain.

I'll readily admit the feature seems rather limited. The only thing I'd add is that there's nothing any of us can do to prevent node operators from adopting such a policy (or any other mempool policy, for that matter).

The video highlights the very serious problem of mining centralization, which puts Bitcoin's main value proposition - censorship-resistance - at risk.
We're asked to imagine giving a trusted member of the Bitcoin community the ability to generate a certain percentage of blocks. This idea is not new - in its extreme form this is known as a "permissioned ledger:"
For good reasons, permissioned ledgers are widely-viewed as fundamentally incompatible with censorship-resistance.
But the video argues that a hybrid proof-of-work/permissioned block generation system would act as a counterbalance to mining centralization. The result would be *improved* censorship resistance.
The problem is, as always, Acton's Law. Power corrupts regardless of whether its source is mechanical or meat. It's not hard to imagine a block czar asking for ever greater power, or for the community demanding that s/he take it on.
Bitcoin at one point seemed to be a way out of this conundrum: we need "good" people in charge to make the right decisions, but being put in charge turns good people into bad people. Software and algorithms are incorruptible, so the idea went. But it turns out that software and algorithms are made and serviced by people, as is the hardware that runs it.
All of which puts us back at square one. But appointing a block czar is a step backward, not the way of the future.

Very good question.
ATM, the only project I know of that's even capable of filling this role is Armory. Although Trezor support has reportedly been in the works for awhile, there still isn't any such support that I know of.
What's needed is a standalone block chain index on which a new kind of wallet can be built. Armory and Electrum Server create their own indexes, but I doubt either one has come up with most efficient system. A dedicated effort would probably uncover many useful optimizations.
I've been kicking around the idea of developing a highly efficient transaction indexing system that would make this possible. Having such an index would greatly cut down on the development time for secure and private wallets built on Bitcoin Core. It may also have other uses.

Interesting idea. The net effect is that Alice takes over Bob's chain of coin ownership, and Bob takes over Alice's. An investigator following either Alice or Bob the block chain hits a dead end.
I also like the idea of multiple channels a la merge avoidance.
Separating the settlement transactions by some period of time also would be an advantage.
However, like traditional mixing services, the operator can keep a log of mixes and potentially report that at a later time. Is there any way to blind the service operator?
@_date: 2015-03-07 23:04:02


I'd approach it differently. Satoshi's white paper clearly spells out what's wrong with the trust-based model that banks and bank-like institutions run. Non-reversibility is impossible - the middle man will always be forced to mediate disputes. Trust is expensive on many levels because people/instittuions with power are corruptible. Trust interferes with privacy.
Using Bitcoin through trusted intermediaries neutralizes all of the advantages of Bitcoin. We end up right back where we were with PayPal and banks. Consumers and merchants see no advantage and quite rationally pass on the "opportunity". Why bother with something that looks and acts like something you already use?
Either centralized Bitcoin services that ape banks and bank-like institutions will fail, or Bitcoin itself will fail. The success of one system makes the other unnecessary.

This is a false dichotomy. No single distribution can "reflect the demands of miners, users, and companies." As we've seen repeatedly, the Bitcoin community is composed of a diverse range of interests that are often at odds with each other.
Implying, as the article does, that one group of developers will be able to solve this problem is invalid on face value.
The Core team has expended a lot of effort just trying to solve Bitcoin's *existing* scalability issues (headers-first synchronization, and faster signature verification, for example). In that light, the statements made in the article seem out of step with reality.

I know nothing of the particulars of this case. However, I am always very skeptical of reports like this. The motives for lying are many, for example:
- collect insurance payout
- confidence game in which you make it seem like you're wealthy
- trying to harm an enemy (or transaction partner of enemy) through framing them with a bitcoin theft
- learning the investigative ability of authorities
- learning willingness of exchanges/mixers to cooperate with investigations
- attempting to break privacy of exchanges and/or mixers by appearing to be a victim
- clawing pack payment for goods
- mischief
Worse, there's never a way to independently disprove the story being told.
Then there's the whole problem of fungibility. What happens to those who, through no act of theft or fraud, end up with the allegedly stolen coins?
If this is in fact a theft, then it's a shame. This should be a lesson to anyone reading who has decided to disregard the numerous warnings that have been sounded about putting a hot wallet on a network-connected device.

@_date: 2015-11-26 04:09:27


It was few relative to the number of Gox customers. That's why the story was such a big deal. "Ten customers lose everything in Japanese bitcoin exchange" wouldn't really carry any headlines.
You are right in the sense that warnings weren't hard to find. But you may be forgetting a couple of things:
- the constant "Why is Gox exchange rate so much higher than other exchanges... can I make money off of that?" posts. These were at least as numerous as the "Get the heck out of Gox" posts - they just didn't end up on the front page."
- the tidal wave of newbies, blown in by the skyrocketing exchange rate, who wanted in at any price
- prominent community members vouching for safety of the exchange
- the massive screw-ups at Gox prior to 2013 blow-off, which seemed to do little to dampen enthusiasm in Gox
I cite these points as evidence that although the warnings were there for all to see, relatively few heeded them.


Both Coinbase and Gemini have made it very clear that when regulators say "jump", they're going to ask "how high?"
So one scenario for a Gox-scale implosion would result from a regulatory clampdown on either exchange. Individual customers could be targeted selectively, or the entire exchange could be frozen. Either way, customer would have no recourse.
Yet another problem could come from the reams of private information both exchanges collect on customers. Should that info fall into the wrong hands, far more than a few bitcoin could be at stake.
I'm not the only one suggesting something like this is possible. Yet how many will withdraw funds from either exchange as a result?

The problem is that nobody knows. What we do know is that there is a bunch of bitcoin-stealing malware out there. It's deployed through the internet, so any network-connected device can fall prey. We also know that a successful theft will for most purposes be irreversible.
Even security experts note the extreme difficulty of securing a network-connected computer:


That can help, but it shifts some of the burden to ensuring that your Coinbase account doesn't get compromised. That's not as easy as it might sound.


One way around that is Tails, which you can burn to a DVD and run without a network connection. The latest version even comes with Electrum pre-installed:


The risk is real and unquantifiable. Using Bitcoin calls for learning about good operational security, attenuating the amount of bitcoin you hold to an amount you feel comfortable losing, or staying on the sidelines until better security tools become available.
Here's a start on learning the basics:

It can't, and there's no way to get it from an address alone.
@_date: 2015-03-22 18:08:37
Good to know.
Just to be clear in case it's not: signing should only be done offline. This should be a dedicated computer, or it could also be a Tails instance (or other Linux live dvd) without a network connection.
Save the entire Coinb.in web directory, available from Github, to a USB or other removable medium. Tails users need to drop this directory into the "Tor Browser" directory before double clicking index.html
For added privacy, transactions can be broadcast through Tor.
I'm really impressed with how well this little tool works. Planning to write a full tutorial soon.

There's one other quality worth considering. And it may be the most important of all.
Electronic payments made through a bank or credit card company can be reversed. One day you have the money, the next you don't.
Bitcoin's most important purpose is to ensure that every transaction is final. Within certain parameters (e.g., ~6 confirmations), the probability of being able to reverse a payment goes to zero.
This is a double-edged sword to be sure. The network doesn't care whether the payment is a legitimate payment or theft.
No other system except physical cash has the same property. But physical cash can't be sent over a computer network, nor secured programmatically, nor easily transported across national borders.

Yes, I've seen that and Joel makes some good points. But that's not necessarily what I'm talking about here.
This approach wouldn't necessarily require a complete rewrite of the Bitcoin node software like Ethereum. The scope of the rewrite would depend on the scope of the changes, so there's a sliding scale of cost.
BTW, I'm not advocating this approach, just pointing out how surprising it is that it hasn't yet been attempted at scale yet.

There's a fundamental pattern that's needed by most contracts. It goes something like this:
Alice and Bob want to transact, but don't trust each other. Alice locks funds in such a way that both Alice and Bob need to agree how to spend the funds. In case Bob is a troll, Alice ensures that a refund transaction gives her back her money at the end of 30 days (or some other period).
What happens next depends on the kind of contract being used. See this video:
It may seem like this talk has nothing to do with contracts, but just keep with it for a few minutes. You'll see the pattern I'm describing, and how flexible it is.
That said, transaction malleability will prevent even this simple scenario from working as well as it should. That's why it needs to be fixed (nothing to do with Mt. Gox-style "attacks").
AFAIK, there is no wallet or software that lets you do even the simplest of contracts of the kind I'm talking about. Early days.

LN has me thinking about how it's often a good idea to divide money into two pools:
- **savings** Hard to use and keys kept offline. Think retirement or vacation fund.
- **spending** Easy to use and keys kept online. Think walking-around money.
This way, a compromise of the spending pool doesn't compromise the savings pool.
Having used the early Lightning wallets a little bit, they seem positioned as a good method for managing walking-around money:
- instant confirmation, useful in brick+mortar POS systems and online alike;
- no need to monitor the block chain if just spending;
- can be used to pay for metered services;
- can be used for micropayments;
- account model is a natural fit for LN wallets, unlike the UTXO model that causes so much confusion among new users who will likely start out with walking-around money only;
- fees will likely be based on the amount of money sent, not the far more abstract notion of transaction size/weight.
The transition probably won't be easy or quick. The on-chain mobile wallets developed over the last 5 years will pretty much be useless under LN. It's not the kind of thing that will lend itself to being bolted on.
But I do expect to see a burst of innovation around LN walking-around wallets. It's not unreasonable to think that this could lead to a resurgence of interest by merchants in Bitcoin as a form of payment - especially for smaller payments and metered services.

You raise very good points, and like you I've started to see that privacy problems inherent in Electrum's design.
One way to avoid the IP linkage problem with Bitcoin Core is to only push transactions through a web service such as Blockchain.info:
And - critically important - only ever do so through Tor. That way, even highly connected nodes can't determine your IP address.
This is only really practical with an offline signing system that decouples transaction signing from publication. If you're in the market for one of those and will be running Core, consider Armory.

It's not at all clear XT needs a project lead. Maybe it needs a maintainer to merge Core changes and ensure compatibility with BIP 101. Beyond that, it's far from clear what an XT project lead would actually *do*.
This would change if the XT lead wanted to take Bitcoin in a new direction. This seems to be where Mike Hearn was headed when he started the project. So far, though, I've seen little indication that Gavin wants to take that road.
I suspect that XT can more or less coast on semi-auto for some time. Without a specific purpose beyond implementing BIP 101, it will probably fade away altogether.

First, there is no "smoking gun", and I suspect most of the decline is due to the (successful) drive to steer newbies away from Bitcoin Core and toward lighter wallet alternatives.
However, that drive resulted directly from multi-day Bitcoin Core sync times brought about by the size of the block chain.
Nevertheless, I'd just add to what said.
Check out the prices of VPS hosting, which is one of the most common ways to run a full node. For example, DreamHost:
Bandwidth is often not price-sensitive, nor is CPU. However, disk space is extremely price sensitive. As you can see, just to host the most bare-bones configuration will cost $30/month, and you'll likely have to upgrade mid-year or so to the next tier costing $60/month.
You can shop around and get better prices, but you really have to know what to look for.
The recent stress test have uncovered problems with Electrum servers as well, which use a secondary block chain index to provide services to wallets. Sync time from scratch takes between a couple of days and a week.
Other higher-level services require extensive block chain indexing, and the costs of doing so are rarely taken into account during scalability discussions. These higher-level services provide a powerful incentive for users to run their own nodes. Altruism, not so much.

The idea of "hard money" is hopelessly out of fashion at the moment. However, as the cycle evolves, we may well reach a point where anchoring a currency to a hard asset begins to make sense to more folks.
Gold has served this purpose, but it's inconvenient to use. Audits take place behind closed doors. Few individuals want to actually hold gold because it's so difficult to transport and store. As a result, convertibility guarantees get tested less broadly and less often than they should.
Bitcoin could solve these problems, but I wouldn't expect it to happen for a long time at best. If it happens at all, it would probably begin with a small country trying to pull itself out of a hyperinflationary spiral.

You can spend any valid unspent output.

Every time you connect to an Electrum server to get transactions, you send all of your addresses.
All this stuff about change addresses, disposable addresses is designed to keep addresses separate. Yet your connection to the Electrum server reverses this in one fell swoop.
If the server also knows your IP address, then it can be much easier to link your transactions to your real world identity. For example, the Electrum server operator could also run a popular website on which you've registered using your real name/email, or the operator could have access to its logs. Geolocation can pinpoint your physical location, etc.
Going through Tor keeps the Electrum server from learning your IP address and through that information pinpointing your identity, physical location, etc.

The only information available through that transaction that wasn't likely to have been previously available is your public key.
A pay-to-address payment only reveals a hash of your public key. But when you redeem that payment, you need to give your public key.
However, by sending the unsigned transaction to a 3rd party, what you give up is privacy. They can now link your public key to an IP address.

I'm not sure the math is correct, though. At $2700/BTC,  the exchange rate is:
    100¢   $2700            ฿1               0.0027¢
    ----- * ------  * ------------------ = ----------
      1$      ฿1       シ100,000,000          シ1
So there's still a long way to go before we're even close to シ/¢ parity.

A coin is an unspent output. The terms "coin" and "unspent output" are often used interchangeably.
"Electronic coin" was also defined in the white paper as "a chain of digital signatures." The connection is that a transaction chain (or chain of ownership) effectively represents a chain of digital signatures.


Agreed, except that "bitcoin" is typically used as a mass noun. For example, "I have 25 bitcoin" - not "I have 25 bitcoins." This is similar to the way "euro" is used in parts of the EU.

Here's a simple test to cut through the BS. Replace every occurrence of the word "Bitcoin" in the article with "OneCoin." With a properly-tuned BS meter, re-examine the article's claims:
- nowhere does the article offer evidence of OneCoin's "growing" use in Ecuador, nor does it offer any use metric at all;
- the article contradicts itself about OneCoin being "banned" in Ecuador;
- the only evidence of OneCoin being used in Ecuador is a single picture of some people posing and a reference to Localbitcoins.

Interesting post, but it doesn't really address the risks to users who deploy UASF. I'm still trying to get my head around the risks, so I'm going to ask some dumb/repetitive questions here.
Let's say I'm running a UASF node. That means that on August 1 my node will start rejecting blocks not signaling segwit.
Currently, about 1/3 of the hash rate is signaling segwit:
Assuming that this figure stays put, my node will begin to reject the majority chain starting on August 1. This would not be good for me because it would meant that my node has effectively been forked off the network. Given that I'm on a minority chain, I run the risk of support for UASF evaporating very quickly and being stuck forever on a stale chain.
If I don't deploy UASF, none of this happens, I stay on the majority chain, and my node goes on as before. No interruption. No downgrade to legacy. Low chance of receiving useless tokens.
Now let's say a large miner or two pulls out of signaling segwit before August 1. The hash rate signaling segwit drops to 10%. Now I'm even more likely to get stuck with tokens I can't spend on the main chain.
Am I missing anything here?

As says, the server learns all of your addresses. It also knows you IP address. If you repeatedly connect your online wallet to Electrum servers, eventually they can nail your IP address and all transactions.
An investigator could set up a farm of 40 or so logging Electrum servers to group multiple blocks of ownership chains by user. Very creepy potential there.
You can mitigate this somewhat by only connecting to a single server that you run. But running an Electrum server isn't easy.
Using Tor or a VPN hides your IP address, but still links addresses together for the server to see.

~~Payment channels (and other o~~Off-chain methods~~)~~ could enable sub-satoshi payments, however you'd only be able to settle on the block chain to the nearest satoshi.

Gavin has his own GitHub account. He can fork the bitcoin/bitcoin repository any time to his own gavinandresen/bitcoin repository and make changes. Gavin can send a pull request to the bitocin/bitcoin repo. The owners of that repo are free to accept or reject the request. The reverse process works as well.
Users can decide which of these repositories, if any, they'll use to run their nodes.
Git is a decentralized system, and GitHub is just one way to use Git collaboratively. Decentralization scares a lot of people when they come face-to-face with its true meaning: nobody is in charge.

Odd use of the word "win." UASF nodes will steadfastly reject any block that doesn't signal segwit. Legacy nodes will accept blocks with or without the segwit bit set.
One way or another, UASF nodes are splitting off the network - with or without hash power backing the chain. The less hash power joins in, the more shaky the security situation for UASF nodes. That doesn't sound like a win.

Testnet was the first altcoin. Buying and selling testnet coins is frowned upon and always has been. If you try to use testnet coins to pay for something, people would probably shrug.
Regardless, testnet coins are scarce, and that means they have value. For example, this guy was willing to buy at a rate of 100K testnet/mainnet in 2013 and still there don't seem to have been any takers:
Given that it's impossible for any one block chain to be all things to all people (despite what ETH supporters might claim), and that digital scarcity seems to create its own value, it's only reasonable to conclude that a diversity of blockchain tokens will be traded for the foreseeable future.

Lawyers read "wet" code in the form of laws and rulings.

The simples kind of smart contract is an escrow. You and I lock funds with a 2-of-2 multisig script. Then both of us have to agree before the funds get spent.

If I understand, your point is that there is no way to be neutral other than to exit Bitcoin.
In contrast to previous soft forks where non-generating nodes could refuse to update and continue using Bitcoin (albeit with reduced security), UASF forces non-generating nodes to choose a side - even passively. Choose the side whose chain ends up stalling (UASF or Legacy) and you could lose money.

Very interesting idea, but it's not quite clear how Hedgy does this.

- How much would I deposit into the 2-of-3 multisig?
- How many dollars would my counterparty deposit with Hedgy (or some other third party)?
- If my counterparty didn't pay the full $2000 as deposit, how will I get my full $2000 if the exchange rate declines and the counterparty refuses to pay the difference?
- If Hedgy goes under or loses the counterparty deposit before the contract expiration, what are my options?

No worries. If you have a functional Electrum wallet, you can export a "master public key" with the Wallet -&gt; Master Public Key menu option. You'll see a QR code + a hex string. Either paste the hex string or scan the QR code into the Androind Electsum app.

Good questions. Some info here:
The main risk of reducing the checkblocks count is that an attacker could modify your local copy of the block chain to trick you. For example, attacker wants to send you a coin that's already been spent. So his exploit modifies your copy of the block chain to remove the transaction spending his coin.
After that, I'm not clear on how the attacker profits. The network will detect his double spending attempt and reject it before it even gets to you.
I suppose you'd still want to check some blocks to guard against accidental corruption of the block files.

To expand on 's answer:
The big idea behind public key cryptography is the "trapdoor function". Imagine a floor with a trapdoor over a deep hole. You can fall in very easily and get stuck. However, you can only get out if you have a ladder, or expend a lot of physical work and time digging your way out.
Some mathematical functions work like a physical trapdoor in that they easily run in the forward direction. But running them in reverse requires either: (1) knowledge of a secret; or (2) a lot of time and computational power.
Trapdoor functions start out as reversible functions. Multiplication is a good example. It yields a product from two factors. Factorization runs multiplication in reverse, producing two factors given a product. Factorization is easy regardless of the size of the numbers because division is easy and there are so many correct answers. However, factoring the product of two primes takes much more work. There is only one pair of factors.
We can build a simple authentication system based on prime number multiplication and factorization. Here's how it works. I begin by choosing a secret key consisting of two prime numbers S1 and S2. Then, I multiply S1 and S2 together to give my public key, P.
I send you P via email, but keep S1 and S2 secret. We schedule an in person meeting. When we greet, you give me P. This is the challenge. I give you S1 and S2 as my response.
You can confirm that both S1 and S2 are prime numbers and that when multiplied together they give P. This proves my identity. Notice that I didn't have to send S1 or S2 via email, yet you are now convinced that I am the person who sent you the email. Pretty amazing when you think about it.
Let's say my evil twin Chuck arranges for me to be absent from our meeting while he takes my place. Chuck doesn't know S1 or S2 but plans to fake it. You give him P and he starts grinding away to find prime factors S1 and S2. He eventually finds them and gives them to you. Chuck has broken our authentication system.
The fix is simple - we use larger prime numbers dozens of digits long. When you give Chuck P, he now faces a nightmarish computational challenge. S1 and S2 are very large prime numbers, so Chuck needs to search a huge range of possible S1 and S2. If these values are large enough, Chuck simply won't be able to brute force a solution. He'll be unmasked as an impostor.
Of course, our authentication system has problems. The biggest problem is that I prove my identity by giving you S1 and S2. You could easily take these values and impersonate me. So I need a way to prove that I know S1 and S2 without giving them to you. That's were digital signatures come in.

The concept to understand is "trapdoor function."
A trapdoor function is easy to perform in the forward direction and hard to perform in the reverse direction.
For example, I give you two prime numbers (x, y) and ask you to multiply them together. Easy. No matter how big x and y are, you can tell me the answer without much trouble.
Next, I give you a number (z) and ask you to tell me which two prime numbers (x, y) were multiplied to give them.
z = x * y
If x and y are small, then it's easy. Set both to 2, multiply, and check for equality to z. If your number and z match, then you're done. If not, increment x and try again. When you reach z / 2, increment y and repeat. Repeat until you've tried all possible (x, y) or discovered z.
But if I choose x and y from a sufficiently large set, your problem explodes in complexity. No matter how quickly you solve the problem, I can expand the range of (x, y) so that it begins to cost you more to solve the problem than you can afford.
This is vaguely similar to how things work with address generation - a flawed analogy. Nevertheless, consider (x, y) as a private key that only you know and z is your public key. You can generate your private key (x, y) just by picking two large prime numbers. You can give anyone z. They will be unable to guess (x, y), but you can prove you created z by revealing (x, y).

Your router protects you from random external sources trying to make connections with your computer. To act as a peer on the network, this is the kind of connection you need to accept.
On the other hand, your router is quite liberal about the sources you connect with. So you can connect with a node and receive data without performing any configuration.
Opening port 8333 allows peers on the network to connect to your computer, something your router would prevent by default.

Agree - Electrum is excellent except for this one thing. For anyone who cares about privacy, though, it can be a dealbreaker.


That's one approach.
The basic problem is that wallets that don't store the complete set of transactions need to need to ask for them. The asking creates the problem.
If, somehow, it weren't necessary to ask for all relevant transactions together, then the problem could be avoided.
Another possibility might be to run Electrum in a restricted mode that doesn't attempt to sync the entire set of addresses. Instead a user could choose one individually to gather its available unspent outputs from the server. It's kind of hackey, but I haven't come up with anything better.
edit: well, actually, there's another possibility. Rather than pulling all transactions from the same server, collect them from multiple servers. Get one from here, one from there, etc.
Unfortunately, this is vulnerable to a Sybil attack in which an investigator runs a large Electrum server farm. Might be better than nothing, though.

The more paranoid you are, the harder your task. There is no upper limit. Let your threat model guide you.
There are two threats here: (1) that your software doesn't work and will miscalculate the address (possibly maliciously); (2) that in verifying the address you'll accidentally leak the private key to an attacker.
You could get around (1) by writing your own code. Depending on your skills, it might not be as hard as it sounds. Or you could compare the results of a panel of existing private key-&gt;address tools. The more tools based on independent code agree, the less likely you've got ahold of a bad public/private key pair.
Regarding (2), your main threat is a network-based attacker. Booting up a Linux instance from CD without network connectivity can reduce, but not eliminate the risk. You'll want to make sure the CD itself is secure by checking digital signatures and/or checksums. You'll also want to make sure the hardware is as secure as you need it to be. Was it purchased new or used? How many other people have had access to it? Do you frequently use USB devices picked up from random places? (
And so on.
As you can see, there are no ironclad answers - only shades of gray. If you have doubts, remove them by educating yourself - before committing serious money.

In my tests, it takes about 8 hours on mid-range equipment.
If you haven't updated Armory in a while, it might be worth doing so. Recent releases optimize resource use far better than previous versions, meaning that it takes less time/memory/CPU strain to build the index (~1.5 h on top of Core sync in my tests).
@_date: 2015-03-23 15:35:59


Not likely at all. There are 2^160 addresses, which is enough to give each person on Earth ~2x10^38 of them. At 100 million tx/day, assuming a unique receiving address for each one, it would take 4x10^37 years to exhaust the supply.
@_date: 2015-03-09 16:55:18
The best I can gather at this point is that what you're seeing is a -26 occurring within Bitcoin Core that's getting relayed to you through Electrum.
Error -26 appears to be thrown by Core when a transaction or block breaks network rules:
In other words, there could be something wrong with the transaction. If it is a dust limit issue, be sure to inspect all outputs to make sure they're 5400 satoshis or more. Bumping the fee can fix the issue, but it might not, depending on the configuration of the coins controlled by your wallet.
You can get more control by spending a coin directly. To so so click the "receive" tab, and right click on an address and choose "spend from". Be sure that the change from your payment will be well ~~below~~ above the dust limit.
As of 0.10.0 the dust limit is 540 satoshis, but you may be connected to a server running an older version, in which case the dust limit will be 5400 satoshis.
Edit: after looking at your screenshot again, it looks like the error isn't dust, but "missing inputs". You can use the same approach of spending from a specific address, and see if that works. However, if you've received multiple payments to a single address, doing so may not work.
You may want to do as suggests, but be very careful. If you've never restored from seed before, you need to be extra cautious that you've correctly written down your seed.
I like to tell people that the time to test a backup is immediately after you create it, not when you need it. This is why.

Reduced to 540 satoshis in 0.10.0:

The gap limit may not be the problem at all - I'm just guessing.
You have two deterministic wallets. One is online and one is offline. They're mathematically linked through master public/private keys, respectively.
A deterministic wallet generates addresses in sequence. However, an online wallet can't keep checking addresses forever. Wallets deal with this problem by imposing a gap limit. The gap limit is the number of unused addresses that can be encountered before synchronization aborts.
Let's say the gap limit of my online wallet is 10. Somehow I generate 15 addresses, and then make a deposit into 
I then fire up another online wallet and attempt to sync. I won't find my  payment because it lies outside of the gap limit.
I'm not 100% clear how Armory handles this problem. Some quick searches didn't turn up much.

How would you evaluate your risk under this scenario:
You deploy BIP148. July 31 rolls around and segwit signaling has dropped to 20% (it's about 33% now).
You're about to reject any block that doesn't signal segwit. Do you go through with it?
What if a few days later segwit signaling drops to 15%? 10%. What if this continues for a few weeks with minor ups and downs. Are you willing to accept coins mined on the minority chain? If so, do you do so at a premium or discount?

FWIW, I'm referring to Hearn's suggestion that nodes themselves would somehow self-destruct when loaded with too many transactions. The fix was not overly difficult, yet the issue was portrayed like a ticking time bomb.
As for 5 hour confirmation time, what do you think that delay would have been if the block size limit were 2 MB today? 4MB?
@_date: 2017-05-18 19:06:18
That top section can be condensed into one line:


The risk here appears asymmetric. Legacy nodes will accept either block type as valid and so will follow whichever chain has the most proof-of-work. BIP148 nodes will only accept segwit-signalling blocks.
Staying Legacy lets you sit back and wait for the whole mess to sort itself out. Adopting BIP148 means you risk your economic well-being by accepting coins that are rejected by Legacy nodes. It seems possible that the BIP148 effort could fall apart pretty quickly under those conditions, with weakly-committed players jumping ship, producing a snowball effect.

I don't believe so. In other words, a channel can only be opened once and can't be topped up in the same way, for example, a debit card can.
The reason comes down to how a channel is opened. Before the channel is funded, the client (person receiving services) obtains the signature of the server (organization providing services) on a time-locked refund payment transaction using a 2-of-2 multisignature script. The refund transaction guarantees the initial channel funding amount will be payed out from the channel to the client in the event the server becomes unresponsive.
A channel is "opened" by a client signing a transaction that funds it.
The refund transaction, signed by the server before the client signs the funding transaction, is the client's guarantee that no matter what they're going to get a service or a full refund from the server.
If an additional coin is locked to the same 2-of-2 timelocked script, it can only be spent with the cooperation (signature) of the server. And there could be many reasons that the server would be unwilling or unable to sign. So although new money could be added to the channel, the client's ability to recover it in a timely manner would be degraded considerably.
@_date: 2017-05-18 18:42:20




That seems a little brief. No risks whatsoever?
Imagine segwit is adopted by 10% of the hash power between August 1 and November 15 (the window of activity for BIP 148). What will BIP148 nodes do with all of the "invalid" blocks being generated by the hash rate majority?
I say "invalid" because of this paragraph from BIP 148:


It appears that those blocks, which the rest of the network accepts, and which are being produced in copious quantity compared to segwit-signaling blocks, will be rejected by BIP 148 nodes.
"Legacy" nodes would just see a bunch of stale blocks, which would be disregarded. BIP148 nodes, however, would see only a minority block chain growing slowly - at least initially.
Or is there something I'm missing?

To simplify matters - when you see your transaction contained within a valid block, that means your payment has been confirmed. When you see your transaction as pending, your payment may or may not go through.
Now for the complexity. If you paid Person B with the same coin(s) (i.e., outputs) as Person A, and that transaction appears in the block chain, then Person B has the money and Person A will never get it.
If, however, you paid Person B with different coin(s) than Person A, there's a chance both A and B will still get their money. Re-paying Person A will cause you to double pay.
If you don't know what "outputs" are or think I'm talking about "bitcoin" when I say "coin," you're going to need to get over a pretty steep learning curve.

Tainting the allegedly stolen coins is the problem here because it plants the seed of an idea that if BTC-E won't take them, maybe bitstamp won't either. And if bitstamp won't then maybe Coinbase won't. And so on. Eventually, the coins are refused as payments by non-exchanges and individuals. The coins quickly become useless. Nobody would accept them for fear of not being able to spend them.
And if it's this easy for one exchange to get the ball rolling, imagine how easy it would be with government or organized crime coercion.

I've used Electrum for a long time and find it a good compromise between utility and ease of use. That's about as good as it gets for wallets.
Electrum 2 is a major upgrade from Electrum 1. Lots of very nice features. The former should be released very soon. They look similar, but, for example, the 2 wallet update is one-way.
I especially like Electrum for offline signing and cold storage. It runs well on Tails, which remembers nothing between sessions and uses TOR by default. All of those are positive.
In my view, the biggest drawback of Electrum is privacy. The server you connect with knows all of your addresses.
Armory is getting more interesting, given headers-first-synchronization for Bitcoin Core and other optimizations possibly on the way like pruning. Armory does require Bitcoin Core, so if storage is an issue, it won't be a good option, for awhile at least.

*Importing* a private key weakens the security of your wallet in two ways:
1. That private key may have been exposed elsewhere without your knowledge.
2. The backup procedure must capture the imported private key as well or you can lose money.
*Sweeping* a private key is much more secure, and involved creating a new transaction that relocks coins to a key pair already under the control of the wallet. That way, no matter who knows the old private key, swept funds have all the security of the wallet itself.
Most wallets support sweeping, even if the functionality is hidden.

I decide unilaterally that the block reward is 0 BTC starting August 1. As of that date, my node will reject any block paying a subsidy. I start a Twitter campaign and a Slack channel in support of my idea. I post to constantly. Miners roll their eyes, but I get a few followers running full nodes to somehow signal their support.
August 1 arrives.
From my perspective, the protocol has changed and those continuing to accept blocks paying a subsidy are not using Bitcoin.

The Bitcoin Foundation, the Digital Currency Institute, and the XT maintainers are similarly unlikely to succeed in taking on that role, either.
Although Bitcoin means different things to different people, two unique value propositions stand out above all the others:
- *Censorship-resisitance.* Nobody can prevent me from using my money as I see fit because there's no central operator to bribe, threaten, or corrupt.
- *Money without government.* Decoupling money from the state is a powerful idea that can transform society if it's successful.
Everything else that Bitcoin does can be done using VISA, the legal system, banks, and PayPal. Conversely, these entities will never be able to offer customers either censorship-resistance or money without government. These features can't be copied because incumbents are fundamentally incapable of doing so.
Which brings us to this idea:


Consider that statement from the perspective of censorship-resistance and independent money. Now compare the current Bitcoin governance model  -- chaotic, inconsistent, and confusing though it may be.
Which model is more likely to preserve Bitcoin's central value propositions?
Or think about the problem from another perspective. What kind of governance model is most likely to preserve the value propositions of censorship-resistance and independent money?

Nevertheless, the only consensus mechanism we have in Bitcoin is hash power.
It's right there in the white paper. A hash rate majority can censor any block, or any transaction for as long as it maintains majority status.
I'm not saying this is an ideal situation - far from it. But if we're going to toss BIP-9 95% signaling out the window, we better be replacing it with something more effective and practical.

Beginners frequently ask why they shouldn't re-use key pairs. When told that the main reason is privacy rather than security, many conclude that key pair re-use is ok if you don't care about this abstract "privacy" idea.
Key pair re-use leads to the situation you're describing. The conceptual answer is simple: "don't re-use key pairs." It's the single best thing you can do to improve privacy and fungibility in Bitcoin. Unfortunately, this turns out to be easier said than done.

Andreas is wrong. Satoshi's identity does matter to Bitcoin - a lot.
It matters because as long as that identity remains unknown, Bitcoin will face a major Satoshi coming out party once every few years. There will also be private coming out parties as well, with swindlers of all stripes claiming to have vast stores of money to post as collateral for loans. Only an expert would understand the proof, so don't worry about it.
The media frenzy generates publicity for Bitcoin. That gets people thinking about Bitcoin, but it comes with a helluva hangover when the fraudster du jour is unmasked. A bit of that taint sticks to Bitcoin every time.
But more importantly than that, think back to the block size limit debate. People who should have known better made routine appeals to authority and tried to claim the mantle of the Almighty Satoshi. The endless debates about Satoshi's original intent. The dissection, down to the atom, of Satoshi's every word. How the other side was abandoning Satoshi's vision.
How differently might that process have played out if Satoshi himself had weighed in?
There's this sinister misconception that Bitcoin is controlled by math. That the protocol stands like a majestic monument on a hill protected from defacement by the rabble below. I disagree. The Bitcoin protocol is controlled by people - people who decide what to believe and which software to run. The protocol is a work in progress subject to change at any time, and it's people who change it by their collective action.
Nothing catalyzes collective action better than a leader. If Satoshi were to make his identity known and once again start participating in the decision making process, it would change Bitcoin - perhaps irreversibly.

Yes. The main reason to do such a thing would be transparency. The stock of money could be checked at any given time by any user of the currency.
You may even be able to implement a fixed-circulation scheme. I remember references to such a thing, but can't dig any of them up at the moment. I don't think you could reliably program in a fixed inflation schedule, though. For that, your users would have to trust you.
Of course, this scheme wouldn't prevent enterprising finance graduates from inventing all kinds of instruments built on top of such a currency. So the transparency benefits might be minimal.

It's not clear to me that this was the problem. I'd be interested in hearing from other Electrum users who experience slowdowns, and how large their wallet files are.
Electrum servers apparently perform poorly during flooding attacks, and there was one recently. Electrum connects to a server, which feeds it the info it needs to process transactions. During times of high transaction volume, poorly provisioned servers fall behind. The net result is that syncing takes much longer than usual.

Feeding this tempest in a teapot is the widespread belief that the bitcoin/bitcoin repository on GitHub is the official, anointed version of Bitcoin.
Git, like Bitcoin, is a distributed system. GitHub is just one way to use Git. The bitcoin/bitcoin repository is just one opinion of what Bitcoin is.
Anyone can fork bitcoin/bitcoin, make changes, then send a pull request. The bitcoin/bitcoin users with write access are free to accept or decline the changes. The process also works in reverse.
It's odd that those who in one moment extoll the virtues of Bitcoin's "decentralization" will in the next moment lament the composition of the group with write access to a particular repository on a specific Git provider.
Decentralization is terrifying to many people when they fully appreciate its most counterintuitive idea: *nobody is in charge*. Wladimir and Gavin are just two voices, and bitcoin/bitcoin is just one software distribution mechanism of many.

Agree that the who doesn't matter. The *why* on the other hand matters a lot because the outcome may not be as avoidable as it might appear.
Very few users are comfortable entertaining the idea that Bitcoin's serviceable period has expired. The protocol outlined in Satoshi's white paper bestows economic incentives on rule-enforcers and extracts penalties on rule breakers. These incentives can be bypassed when the network is small and the value it represents low. But a very different beast emerges at the end of 7 years of continuous operation and relentless exchange rate growth. That network will fight change relentlessly whatever its source and however well-intentioned.
Moreover, Bitcoin's governance model has evolved in a direction that has become ever less compatible with major protocol changes. Bitcoin was established as a Benevolent Dictatorship under Satoshi. Under his successor, more participants began to have a say in project direction. The block size limit question prompted a short-lived revival of Benevolent Dictator model, which backfired. Half a dozen or so competing implementations now run on the network, reducing the influence once enjoyed by the "Core Developer" role. Alternatives to Bitcoin have very rapidly risen to prominence. Each new entrant goes places that look ever more out of reach for Bitcoin.
This is decentralization. It means massive effort will be required to get your way. It means you're probably going to end up disappointed with how slowly things change.
There's a chance that protocol gridlock is inevitable price of success for any system like Bitcoin.

nLockTime doesn't quite work that way. It seems like it should, but doesn't.
Adding a time lock makes a transaction *invalid* until the lock expires. In other words, you can still spend the coins referenced by the transaction until the time lock expires. Only after the time lock expires will the transaction be relayed/confirmed by nodes.
So, a prerequisite would be OP\_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY, or something similar:
There might be a workaround using a technique similar to the one used in contracts. Node operator locks funds with a 2-of-2 multisig challenge script (no nLockTime). Then a time locked refund will give back the deposit after a certain amount of time.
The problem is choosing who the counterparty in the 2-of-2 should be.

The South Park analogy isn't really relevant.
Alice pays Bob one bitcoin using a transaction published to the block chain. That's a contract. We don't often talk about a simple transaction as a contract, but it is.
There's no way anyone other than Bob is unlocking that coin unless they get his key. There's no way for Alice to take back the money unless she can somehow get Bob's key. Those are the rules.
There is no one rules enforcer - there are many enforcers, each with their own agenda. There's no need for a court - the system resolves all disputes using the same cold, unfeeling logic.
You are right in the sense that many forms of contract use oracles (or human arbiters) to decide outcome. But that's a feature added by the parties at the outset, not a requirement. Those who don't want oracles or arbiters must get a bit more creative, but they can still make useful, cryptographically-enforceable deals. For example:

The article doesn't seem to mention the hash rate currently signaling segwit:
It's at about 35% now. Assuming nothing changes from now until August 1, 2017, anyone running a UASF node will be ignoring 65% of the network hash power. They will effectively be on a minority chain with no hope of converging to (or transacting with) the other chain except by rolling back UASF. Non-UASF nodes, however, will continue to accept both blocks and reorganized as expected.
A drop in the hash rate supporting segwit means even less security for the new chain. Conversely, an increase means better security.
UASF proponents argue that the flag day will push miners to signal segwit under threat of having their blocks invalidated. Perversely, the opposite outcome is also possible.
Consider a miner trying to figure out whether or not to start signaling given 35% hash rate support for segwit. This miner wants to avoid a chain split at all costs to avoid a flood of negative press and the resulting bear market just as a monster bull was gathering steam. They couldn't care less about segwit itself.
The main goal is to maintain upward exchange rate momentum to maximize short-term return on rapidly-depreciating hardware investment.
What to do? Given 35% signaling on August 1, the best course of action would be to avoid signaling segwit, and to try to convince every other miner to do likewise. The effect can snowball.
No bad press, no bear market. No segwit.

Because segwit itself, like a 2 MB block size limit increase, would at best only somewhat decrease fees in the short term - even if everyone starts using segwit transactions.

It may or may not. If you want next block confirmation, then 200 satoshis/byte is the going rate. As you can see from the graph, numerous pending transactions have a fee density in the 100 satoshis/byte range.
Nodes sort transactions based on this fee density. Beyond that, IIRC, there is no secondary ordering so your transaction is basically thrown into a pile of similarly-feed transactions.
Nodes running Bitcoin Core will eject an unconfirmed transaction after 72 hours. That doesn't necessarily mean your transaction will disappear from the network within 72 hours. Just that a single node running Bitcoin Core will drop your transaction after that time.

@_date: 2015-03-30 17:06:39
The short answer is that it's complicated - way more complicated than it should be. I'll try to answer based on the info I've gathered.
There are actually *two* fees to consider. You only pay one fee, so think of these fees as two checkpoints your transaction will pass through.
- Relay Fee. Nodes check for this fee before relaying your transaction to peers. Without a sufficient relay fee, your transaction may only partially propagate, and it may appear to be "stuck."
- Confirmation Fee. This is the fee a miner expects to see on a transaction. Without a sufficient confirmation fee, your transaction will be slow to confirm because the network hash power willing to confirm it will be low.
Bitcoin Core 0.9.0 dropped the relay fee from 10 satoshi/byte to 1 satoshi/byte. Most nodes today run &gt;0.9.0, meaning 1 satoshi/byte is a realistic relay fee:
If your transaction spends sufficiently old and/or valuable outputs (in other words, it's of sufficient priority), then it may qualify for a fee waiver.
The confirmation fee floats. Miners running Core with default configuration will reserve some room in a block for high-priority no-fee transactions. When that fills up, the transactions in the memory pool are sorted by descending fee and added in that order to a new block.
The bottom line is this: pay at least 1 satoshi/byte of transaction data. This works out to ~148 satoshis / input. On a typical one-input, two-output pay-to-address transaction, you'll pay 226 satoshis.

Did you follow the steps I outlined above?
If instead you entered your PGP public key into the box on Electsum, then I think you may not have the corresponding private keys to spend funds.
In other words, the sequence of events must be:
master private key (Electrum) -&gt; master public key (Electrum) -&gt; master public key (ElectSum)
Inputting a PGP public key into Electsum makes it impossible to run the process in reverse to recover the necessary master private key.

Bitcoin is easy to use, but extremely hard to use securely and privately.
The problem is that some people will go from the a-ha moment to plunking a significant amount of money into bitcoin. After all, it's so easy to use.
Those same people sometimes end up here with very sad stories to tell. Funds stolen in seemingly inexplicable ways. Paper wallet catastrophes. iPhone dropped and no wallet backup. Exchange made off with all of the money. There is no 1-800 number to call in these situations and it's not what people are expecting.
The financial privacy aspect gets far less attention than it deserves. It
reminds me of some of the stories about people whose lives have been altered in very negative ways through naive use of social media. The damage is being done now, but the effects won't be felt for some time in the future.
There's a tendency to view Bitcoin as a mature technology that can just be given to non-techincal users - end of story. It's not. Bitcoin gives many non-technical users just the rope they'll need to hang themselves. We as a community should be equally up-front about this as we are about the potential benefits.
I'm optimistic that these problems will eventually be solved and that Bitcoin can become a mature technology. Until that happens, a healthy dose of caution can go a long way.

I would pick the project first, then decide on the language.
You're only really going to learn a language by using it in anger on a real project.
Picking the language first means you'll spend less time actually interacting with other developers and finding something interesting to do. Once you've identified an interesting project, learning the language is not very difficult - especially because you already have experience with Java and C++.
The other reason to pick the project first is that some languages are objectively better at certain things than others.
If you want to do high quality iOS development, you must learn Objective-C (or Swift). Android requires Java. If you want to do anything with a browser, you'll need JavaScript. In other words, the language is part of a platform. And often your ideal platform won't support the language you spent so much time to learn.

I know of at least two vulnerabilities that bc.i users are subject to:
1. Paper backup stores the wallet's private keys in browser history: 
2. A bc.i wallet re-uses its key pair, and the wallet service at one time signed transactions in way that allows trivial recovery of the private key: 
The first requires an attacker getting access to your browser history (which can occur in a number of ways). For the second, all an attacker needs is the block chain.

Yes, one of the applications of an extended public key is to create a "watch only" wallet.


That's a tricky one. BIP 32 and related standards proposals are not implemented consistently across wallets yet. So even if a web wallet does offer this feature, there's no guarantee that that extended public key you export can be used with the Web wallet.
Even if such a service were available, you might want to consider the privacy implications of using it. The service would be able to link all of your transactions together, neutralizing the effect of disposable key pairs, at least from the perspective of the service you use. If you connect through clearnet (regular internet) the service can go one step further and link your transactions to your IP address.

Yes. One way would be to use the wallet's master public key. But that shouldn't be readily available to random observers. However, given nothing more than an address, it's impossible to find the other addresses in a deterministic wallet.


No. Given just one address, this isn't possible. However, you can reveal the addresses in your wallet through other channels.
For example, one method can be used for both deterministic and non-deterministic wallets. This privacy attack takes advantage of the idea that every coin that passes through your wallet has an source and destination. That path can be followed with the block chain. If paths can be linked together, then your wallet's address membership can be partially or in severe cases, completely deduced.
One way to leak privacy is to re-use addresses. Another is to join multiple addresses together in the same transaction (multi-input transaction, although there are some caveats to that one). There's more here:
Unfortunately, there are more ways to leak privacy when using Bitcoin.

At any given moment, the urgency of those making transactions varies. Some are desperate for next-block confirmation - and they pay more than the market fee density. Others can wait a few hours without a problem - and they pay less than the market fee density. The first group will bid up the fee density while the second group will bid it down.
Lastly are those who decide not to make a transaction at all. By opting out, they decrease overall demand for block space.
Over long periods of time, the demand for block space and the market fee density reflects the decisions made by all of these users.

Quite right. Multi-input transactions can destroy privacy just as effectively as address reuse.
The Blockchain iOS wallet allows you to select a "from" address when making a payment. I'm not sure about the Android version. Provided that you don't reuse addresses, this might work.

Running Electrum leaks privacy in two main ways:
1. The server learns your IP address
2. The server can link all of your wallet's chains of coin ownership together.
Yes, (1) is solved by using Tor or a VPN.
However, (2) can't be solved this way. And it's a pretty serious privacy leak. All of the work this community has done over the last 2-3 years on deterministic wallets, and not re-using key pairs goes out the window the minute you hand over to anyone a complete set of your wallet addresses.
The main problem is that *anyone* can run an Electrum server. They can do whatever they want with the information they collect. They can share it with others, sell it - anything. If I were evil, I could set up a farm of dozens of Electrum servers, log everything, and sell the information to the highest bidder.

Way cool. I like the idea of doing CoinJoin with general-purpose software such as Reddit.
This approach would seem to require creating a throwaway via Tor for best privacy. Any other tips? Also, what other privacy implications might there be of doing CoinJumble in public like this, assuming Reddit throwaway and Tor used every time?
Here's an experiment: a weekly CoinJumble thread. On a certain day of every week, a self post will solicit inputs/outputs for a new CoinJumble. After a deadline of a few hours or so, the transaction will be published.
This could help raise awareness of how CoinJoin works and why it's useful. With a live example in front of them and a regular schedule of Jumbles, the curious could begin to try it out.

Even if your service is restored, you should consider that any other service can do the same thing at any time. And this doesn't even account for the privacy implications of Circle knowing all your outbound/inbound addresses (and those of all its users).

From the whitepaper under "Calculations" section. It's the probability that an attacker with fractional hash rate q/p can build a chain of length z faster than the rest of the network.
In more practical terms, it's the source of the often-quoted rule of thumb to wait for six confirmations for important transactions. Plugging in p=.05 (5%)  and solving for q/p gives 25%.
An attacker with 25% of the network hash rate will be able to rewrite a six-block sequence 5% of the time. Pretty good odds in most situations.

Just guessing, but it seems as if there's something wrong with one or more coins controlled by your wallet at the moment.
This could just be a temporary thing. For example, a block chain reorganization (which happens from time to time) can put a confirmed payment back into the memory pool.
I hesitate to suggest sending from different addresses as a test because you can make mistakes, sending payments to incorrect addresses and generally make a mess.
However, if you are able to pinpoint the problem to a specific address, you can "freeze" it. Right click, then "freeze" option.
The safest thing I can think of is to look up each of your addresses on a block explorer (blockr.io, blockchain.inf), and compare the balance shown to the one Electrum shows. Also compare any incoming transaction IDs. If you see any differences, that could allow you to pinpoint the problem.

No because you're going to create an unencrypted paper backup of your seed. Then you're going to prove to yourself that you can recover it. Then you're going to put that paper backup in a secure location.
All this *before* you commit any serious money to the wallet.
The "a" in Tails stands for Amnesiac. It's designed to forget everything between sessions (it deliberately wipes memory when you power down to prevent certain attacks). That means you'll need some other way to persist your seed between Tails sessions. A paper backup is one way to do that.

Taking money from investors is not a sustainable business model. Unfortunately, for the vast majority of Bitcoin startups I know of, this is the entire business plan. That, and hope that the exchange rate climbs 10-100x in the next year.
There was a similar problem as the Internet started taking off as well. Too much money chased after too few good ideas, leading to the inevitable shakeout. Maybe the same thing will happen to Bitcoin startups.
If you want to make a Bitcoin entrepreneur nervous, start talking about revenue models. The sad fact is that far too many Bitcoin startups have no viable way to collect money from customers.
One business that seems to at least generate revenue is to sell exchange services. But it's questionable how much money there is to make in that market. Costs are very high (in US) due to onerous regulatory compliance. You end up with a model that combines the worst aspects of bank-like businesses (regulatory burden) and cryptocurrency (small total addressable market). Pivots away from pure play Bitcoin exchange services are to be expected. Survival is at stake.
Bitcoin excels at eliminating the middle man. That sounds like a good idea, but remember that the middle man was collecting a paycheck.
It's going to take the middle man a long time to find a reliable replacement to that old paycheck.

Too often, privacy is discussed as a binary condition - you either have it or you don't. That's not how it works.
You leak privacy in drips and drabs, sometimes over the course of years. The problem with Bitcoin and privacy is that the block chain is permanent - and public. That's never happened before, and people will get burned by it.
Taking steps to ensure financial privacy is just common sense. With the traditional banking system, trusted intermediaries take care of this.
With Bitcoin, you are your own bank. That means taking care of both security and privacy. Not many people have discovered this yet.

I can understand your frustration. If you're new to cryptocurrency (regardless of its incarnation), be prepared for many other surprises. Some of them will be unpleasant, but learning is often unpleasant business.
Most of the issues come from expecting Bitcoin to work in some way like the existing banking system. It does not. To use bitcoin effectively means purging from your mind those preconceptions about how money works, and replacing them with observations of the running system.
Your transaction has taken 6 hours because the fee you paid was too small given prevailing market conditions. That's it. A 2 MB block size limit would have done little to alleviate this problem, nor would a 4MB limit. My guess is your wait would still be just as long if you paid a below-market fee under those big block regimes.
Those other coins you may be trying out would/will have the same problem if they were/will be used for anything substantial. Scaling is an unsolved problem in cryptocurrency, but experiments aimed as solving the root problem (as opposed to applying band-aids) are ongoing.

Nice intro to Schnorr signatures. I'm not sure the claim made in the title is addressed though.
To stop a spam attack requires an understanding of how it was carried out. This article doesn't really address this issue.
One option would be brute force. Simply flood the network with transactions all paying the market fee density.
But that could get expensive really fast.
It's not hard to imagine more economical attacks in which the attacker pays much less because the spam never gets confirmed. Instead the spam simply serves to ratchet up the market fee density.
Begin by flooding the network with a bunch of transactions that will never confirm because fees are too low. This raises the market fee density incrementally. Again, flood the network with a bunch of transactions that will never confirm because fees are too low. Keep doing this until the desired fee density is reached.
And AFAICT, a new signature scheme won't eliminate this attack vector, and may not make it much more expensive. Still, it would be an interesting line to consider.

That applies to Bitcoin Core, but not MultiBit.
MultiBit starts with a single address, which it reuses. That's a privacy issue, but won't cause problems with change which will be returned to the sending address.
The problem arises when you *import* addresses into MultiBit. If two addresses, are available, MultiBit will alternate sending change between the two. Or not. Add more addresses, and it's anybody's guess where change will end up.
As you can see, if you don't understand what's happening underneath, and assume that the paper wallet you imported into MultiBit is empty, and then throw it away and forget to back up again - there's your problem with change addresses.

If you haven't given Electrum a spin, you might try.

That clears up a question I've had for awhile. I've been mainly looking at the 0.10.0 code and so it didn't quite make sense. Seems obvious now that this is what's happening.
This does have the weird side-effect. The rule now says that nodes will reject a low priority transaction without a 1 satoshi/byte relay fee. But until most nodes update to 0.10, low fee transactions will continue to get relayed, and may end up stuck.
Not good.

Clever idea. Maybe this could be useful in other ways.
It would be very helpful for nodes to speak other protocols.
For example, a Pseudo that spoke WebSockets would allow direct communication between a browser and the P2P network. This would be useful for building lightweight Web wallets, among other things.
Or, consider pruning. A node could store non-prunable transactions only, forwarding requests for other transactions to peers. Required disk space would be only a fraction of what it is with a full node.
Or, a node could store the longest chain of headers only, and perform lightweight validation of relayed requests.
I'm not sure what would happen if PseudoNodes started to represent a significant fraction of the network.

You raise very good points. There is a sense that getting a Trezor solves all Bitcoin security problems, but clearly it does not.
The main problem is how to ensure that;
- you will always be able to access your seed,; but
- an attacker never will.
Here are some ideas for solving the problem that have been proposed by others:
- store a copy of your seed in a bank safety deposit box;
- shard your seed using Shamir's Secret Sharing ( then distribute your shards accordingly;
- memorize your seed ( then store a paper copy in an extremely secure, hard-to-reach location;
- lock your funds in a mutisig output.
All of these options come with tradeoffs:
- a bank can seize the contents of your deposit box;
- the people you give shards (or keys) to can possibly collude to steal the money. If you give them a threshold, they will be able to do so without you. If you give them less than a threshold, someone can still steal your keys and you're back to square one;
- memory can fail in the most spectacular and inopportune ways.


That may be the hardest problem of all. Anything guaranteed to transfer your wealth in the event of your death (regardless of criminal involvement) creates an incentive to kill or incapacitate you.
BTW, the issues you raise are the main reason Bitcoin won't be ready for "mass adoption" any time soon, and why Bitcoin doesn't need to concern itself with "mass scaling" for a long time. No sane, non-technical, average person wants to deal with this stuff.

Yes, the block chain only captures transactions between pseudonyms.
However, Bitcoin's privacy model depends on the existence of a wall between your pseudonyms and your identity. If that wall is breached, your privacy can be compromised completely.
Many users have a static IP address. If I can link any of your transactions to your IP address, I can determine your location at least. By combining your IP address with server logs from the services you've created accounts on (like Reddit), I can begin to associated a real-world identity with your transactions.
Using services like Coinbase and BitPay creates more privacy leaks. Combined with poor operational security, your entire financial history becomes an open book. This stuff isn't difficult to do, either.

Dark Wallet has implemented stealth payments:


"Stealth" is misleading in some ways. All of your transactions will be on the block chain, and if your payer (or subsequent payees) uses weak privacy practices, this can help weaken your privacy as well.
Think of a stealth address as an inverted deterministic wallet. The payer controls the offset, not you. Otherwise, the two are equivalent in terms of privacy.
The difference is that you can publish a single public key using a stealth address, while avoiding address re-use. That's really the only advantage.

I suspect that the way we think about Bitcoin privacy will change after/if Lightning Network becomes widely-used. Oddly, LN does some of the things that TumbleBit does.
In particular, TubmleBit and LN both decouple value flow from chain of ownership using contracts. That means that you can no longer follow value flow with just the block chain. You're going to need the info distributed over potentially several LN nodes. If onion-style LN payment routing ever becomes practical, even that window would close.

I would like to use Armory. However, the last time I checked, it can't use compressed public keys.
That's a privacy leak because most wallets use compressed public keys by default. Using uncompressed public keys leaves a telltale marker on the blockchain - when you use a mixer or a coinjoin or whatever privacy-enhancing technique you want to use. Change is frequently (always?) apparent when looking at the transactions of an Armory user. Is the output using an uncompressed public key.
Also, it creates transactions that are unnecessarily large.
Has Armory implemented compressed public keys by default for P2PKH and P2SH payments?

BIP-91 is now LOCKED_IN, according to BIP-9 terminology. There's no need to continue signaling BIP-91 (although it is encouraged). BIP-91 becomes ACTIVE 336 blocks after being LOCKED_IN.
BIP-91 is a mess of a specification, but if you make a bunch of assumptions, that's what you end up with.
But you are right in that we still don't know which miners will actually enforce BIP-91 by rejecting blocks lacking version bit 1.

This is one of those hurdles that everyone trying to understand Bitcoin hits sooner or later. Addresses don't hold value. Only unspent transaction outputs hold value.
The same address can be associated with multiple transaction outputs, which is what happens when you re-use the same payment address.
Whether the outputs are linked to the same address or different addresses, you still need to pay for each one you spend. That means you can't economize by sending multiple payments to the same address.
Fortunately, you can keep coins of multiple denominations in your wallet, then choose the one(s) best suited for your payment. That takes a little bit of planning, and isn't always possible depending on how you're receiving coins. If you're pulling them out from an exchange (or other off-chain service), however, you have a lot of control over the denominations you'll receive.

If nothing else (port, header versions) change, maybe, but I'm not sure.
Imagine one group of nodes, let's call them the Pros, decides to lift the cap on block size to 20 MB. The other group, let's call them the Cons, decides to continue rejecting any block larger than 1 MB. For simplicity, imagine that both groups have equal hash power.
The current block is B.
Several minutes after firing up Procoin mining nodes, a 1MB+ block (P1) is mined by the Pros, but rejected by the Cons as being too large. The Cons mine their own smaller block shortly thereafter (C1). The Pros accept C1 because it's valid according to their rules.
From the perspective of the Pros, the block chain has been forked (with tips at P1 and C1), and both branches are at equal height. According to the Cons, there is no fork and C1 is the tip. Some renegade group tried to publish a massive block P1, but it was rejected.
The Pros announce block P2, which is &lt; 1MB, and extends P1. Even so, the Cons reject P2 because it extends the invalid P1 block.
Then the Cons mine a new block, C2. This block is accepted by both groups. Each side sees (at the risk of messing up the ASCII art):
 
           +--+  +--+                            
         +-+P1+--+P2|                            
    +--+ | +--+  +--+          +--+   +--+   +--+
    |B +-+                     |B +---+C1+---+C2|
    +--+ | +--+  +--+          +--+   +--+   +--+
         +-+C1+--+C2|                            
           +--+  +--+                            
                                                 
            PROS                      CONS       
If the Cons release the next block, C3, building on C2, then the Pros will be forced into a reorganization. Both sides will end up seeing the same longest chain (B-C1-C2-C3), and any transactions unique to the B-P1-P2 branch will need to be reconfirmed.
This would make Procoin very unstable due to all of the reorganizations and apparent loss of confirmations. Concoin would remain stable because it never branched. With less than 50% of the combined hash power, it's hard to see how Procoin could survive. Even with minority hash power, Concoin should remain stable.
So I think Procoin would need to explicitly invalidate Concoin blocks to survive.
I may have missed something obvious here. I'm just working through the example to see where it goes.

BadUSB is real and can do bad things:
has a good suggestion. Here's a variation you can use to minimize the USB risks:
0. Install Tails onto a DVD to avoid even booting through USB. This means you're only using USB to store a master public key and transactions.
1. Only use a USB drive that you bought and unpackaged yourself. Never use a drive obtained from a third party. Never use your USB drive with another computer.
2. Create your unsigned transactions from Tails in online mode. This uses Tor, which hides your real IP address from the server - a privacy bonus.
3. Reboot into Tails in offline mode to sign the transaction.
4. Reboot into Tails in online mode to publish the transaction.
In other words, your online and offline computers are the same computer. The online mode uses Tails with an internet connection. The offline mode uses Tails without an internet connection.
The threats you face are that an attacker can use badusb to get ahold of your seed, execute a man-in-the-middle that changes a payment address, drops a change output so you pay a huge miner fee, etc.
However, this is unlikely to happen using the system described here. You'll only ever use the USB drive within a Tails instance. That means you start a fresh OS from DVD every time you insert the USB stick into your computer.
The only way to install a badusb exploit on the USB drive is to download it while running an online Tails session. You won't be browsing random sites in this session, if at all. This only leaves the Electrum server itself and Electrum as an attack vector. Always possible, but not very likely. If Electrum itself is compromised, no amount of security on your end can fix it.
There is one possibility that this system can't protect you from. The video mentions badusb infecting built-in USB devices, such as a keyboard or camera.
If your hardware is infected this way, then Bitcoin security is the least of your problems.
The ultimate countermeasure in this case is to buy a brand new computer with a DVD drive and use it for online/offline Tails sessions.
Beyond this, we get into the realm of tinfoil hats.

I like Rush Wallet as an on-ramp that bypasses Bitcoin's complexity.
The problem is when a user starts to rely on Rush Wallet to manage larger sums, there's a very good chance that funds will be stolen. For example, it may not be clear that anyone with the wallet link can spend funds. Maybe a weak password is used to make it easier to remember.
Another problem is expectations. People using the traditional banking system have come to expect money to work in a certain way. For example, you can get your money back if someone steals it from your online account. So users get accustomed to lax computer security. If these practices are translated to Bitcoin, the user will eventually become a target.

Block version numbers are a funny thing because they only permit a single path forward: increment.
For example, imagine that Concoin, in preparation for an upcoming soft fork, starts using v=4. Now Concoin blocks become valid once again by Procoin nodes, and it's back to square one.
This is a general problem with the block versioning scheme, it seems. The only alternative would be for Concoin to skip v=4, but why do that given that few using Concoin care about (or know about) Procoin (and probably wants it to fail anyway).

Theft in Bitcoin means that an attacker has stolen the ability to digitally sign a transaction that reassigns ownership of one or more of your coins.
This usually means an attacker has found your private key, but the ways in which this can happen are numerous, often very technical, and non-obvious.
For example, private keys can be taken directly from the block chain itself if your software is written badly:
Beginners often face the problem of never having directly used a private key before. Private keys are not like passwords, despite what many sources may try to convey. Thinking of them in this way can lead to trouble. More here:

AFAIK, no. A new node syncing for the first time would need the full set of transactions to verify the UTXO set.
The problem is that a UTXO-only node can lie by omission. For example, a child transaction spends an output in a node's UTXO set. But the node leaves out that detail and only gives you the parent transaction.
When you sync a node for the first time, you'll have no record of the child transaction. This opens the door to double spending.

It's a variation on Merge Avoidance:
Outputs are relatively inexpensive to create. So when you pull from cold storage into a hot wallet, you can give yourself a range of denominations that will work well based on your past spending habits. For example, you may make monthly payments. Rather than just dumping one large output into your wallet, or a random assortment of outputs, you make sure one of the denominations can cover the monthly payment without creating change. Your hot wallet needs to enable coin control, though, which almost none of them do.
Another idea would be to "clean up" low-valued outputs on the weekend, when fees are quite a bit lower. But again, your wallet will need some form of coin control.

Wallet software must be open source (or source code available at least) or nobody will use it. That makes it hard to make money on a wallet by itself. This is something Armory Technologies also appears to have discovered, and failed to find a solution to. BTW, remember Hive?
And if wallet developers don't get paid, wallets don't get developed.
I can think of two wallets that have generated a significant following of open source developers: Bitcoin Core and Electrum. Breadwallet and Mycelium might be a third/fourth. In every case, I don't see much if any money being made.

Here's my best attempt to explain what this means. It's probably wrong in one or more important ways.
This has to do with BIP-91:
This BIP and UASF (BIP-148) share a common purpose: to force activation of segwit with less than 95% hash rate support by rejecting any block that doesn't signal for segwit.  UASF has a start time on Aug. 1st. BIP-91 had a start time of June 1st. Both BIPs time out on Nov. 15.
Both BIP-91 and segwit use BIP-9, which is a protocol for enabling soft forks. BIP-9 repurposes the block header "nVersion" field as a sequence of 32 bits. Backward compatibility with previous upgrades forces the leftmost three bits to be set as "001". This leaves the remaining 29 bits for signaling updates that are "in flight" at the same time. Segwit uses the second to rightmost bit (bit one, aka 1&lt;&lt;1). BIP-91 uses bit 4 (fifth from right, aka 1&lt;&lt;4). Using the ASCII art made by we have:
    0010 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0001 0010
    \ /                              | ||| \ Bit 0: BIP68, already activated, so can be re-used later on.
     |                               | || \ Bit 1: Segwit
    old way of                       | | \ Bit 2: nothing yet
    softforking.                     |  \ Bit 3: nothing yet
    should remain                     \ Bit 4: BIP91 
    for compatibility.
BIP-9 has the details:
"Antpool just mined a BIP91 block" means that Antpool has just published a valid block in which bit 4 is set ~~(bit 1 is also set, but that's not required by BIP-91 at this stage)~~. In doing so, Antpool is signaling that it intends to follow BIP-91.
BIP-91 uses a two-stage deployment mechanism.
Stage 1 is underway. When 269 of the last 336 blocks (80%) signal by setting bit 4, then stage 2 begins.
Under stage 2, any block that fails to set bit 1 will be rejected.
This critical consensus rule is conveyed through the following tortured, grammatically invalid sentence - so I may well have misinterpreted it:


The reference implementation included in BIP-91 seems to agree with my interpretation. However, that code isn't exactly clear and seems to lack some important context.

Hashed timelock contracts (HTLCs) are the magic that can make Lightning Network work well. In a nutshell, a HTLC links two unrelated chains of coin ownership on the same block chain as one unit. Here's a good explanation of how HTLCs fit into LN:
HTLCs have numerous applications, one of them being the linkage of transactions *across* block chains. It may be possible to get a LN that spans both the Bitcoin and Litecoin block chains. See, for example:
This scenario may sound similar to something that doesn't get discussed very much anymore: sidechains. You can get at least some of the things sidechains promised with just HTLCs and altcoins.

In a nutshell, Varoufakis' killer app for block chain technology is to issue 2-year bonds (FT-coin). In his mind, deflation, not excessive borrowing, is the root cause of Greece's economic problems. Under this economic model, more debt is the solution.
If I'm not mistaken, countries have been issuing bonds without Bitcoin for some time now. FT-coin merely gives smaller countries a fiscal policy loophole to expand the money supply. It's doubtful this loophole would remain open for very long.

I'm not sure. There's a major stumbling block in that transactions only support one null data (OP\_RETURN) output. You need one of these for every stealth payment contained in a transaction.
So splitting a payment among multiple stealth addresses isn't possible currently. That won't matter for some applications, but for others it will matter a lot.

Did you change the default fee? With Electrum it's set at 0.2 mBTC.
Your transaction is 17,004 bytes, which is quite large. The minimum fee for network nodes to relay the transaction is 1 satoshi/byte. In your case, that works out to 17004 satoshis, or 0.17 mBTC. Your fee was only 0.1 mBTC.
I'm guessing that some nodes are relaying the transaction anyway, but most are rejecting it. So your transaction will only be thinly distributed among miners. Maybe one will get lucky and confirm your transaction, maybe it won't.
If you're able to send the transaction again, be sure to include a fee of at least 0.17 mBTC. I would double or maybe triple that to be sure.

@_date: 2015-03-07 22:32:54
The phrase needs to be converted to a 256-bit value to make a private key (or seed). That's often done by applying a hash function such as SHA-256.
SHA-256 is a widely-known, standard hash function.
That said, key pair generators can use any number of methods to get a 256-bit value from a phrase. Two rounds of SHA-256 hashing. One hundred rounds. Scrypt hashing. Lots of options are available.
So, yes, some software *may* use a different method to transform your pass phrase. One way to solve the problem is to keep a copy of the software in a secure location.
That said, you really should reconsider generating your own pass phrase:

The number to watch will be the UASF hash rate. If it can't sustain a rate high enough to generate at least 2,016 blocks by Nov. 15, segwit won't even be activated.

Kind of far out, but maybe:
- An autonomous, cash-in/cash-out kiosk (ATM). It sets exchange rates such that once filled, no cash or bitcoin need to be added. On the back end, it hedges and actively trades. When enough profit has been realized, it pays a contractor to install another.
- A web server that pays for its own VPN hosting, domain name registration, and SSL certificate through the proceeds of its own business activities. Maybe it's an oracle, or provides some other service payable in bitcoin. The server scales itself by buying new instances and negotiating contracts for additional services.
The problem with these scenarios is that the agent needs to keep its own private keys to pay for its services. But as we've seen time and again, network connectivity and private keys don't mix well. So you'd have to solve that problem under any scenario of machine to machine payments.

Thanks - the key concept appears to be the phrase "while this BIP is active." I'm going to assume this means "ACTIVE" as defined by BIP-9. BIP-91 is a showcase of slop, so we'll be making a lot of assumptions about its meaning along the way.
From BIP-91 Deployment:


This word jumble appears to tell us that BIP-91 is using the BIP-9 deployment mechanism. Even though "BIP9" is just stuck into the sentence, I'll go along with that assumption.
Moreover, BIP-91 appears to be redefining "retarget period" as defined by BIP-9. BIP-9 itself doesn't explicitly define retarget period, but reading between the lines and based on previous use, this means 2,016 blocks. Period.
So we must assume that the intent is to redefine "retarget period" to mean 336 blocks instead of 2,016 blocks. Fine, let's roll with it. However, we need to realize that although BIP-9 hints at using thresholds other than 95%, it says nothing AFAICT about changing the "retarget period." So it's a leap.
About the time between lock in and filtering, BIP-9 has this to say under States:


After being locked in, one retarget period elapses before the proposal becomes ACTIVE. That assumption about redefining "retarget period" is really getting some use here. Imagine the chaos that would ensue if a miner is using a slapped-together implementation of BIP-91 that accidentally forgets to account for this oddity.
From BIP-91 Deployment:


BIP-9 makes no provision for a proposal changing state from ACTIVE. An ACTIVE proposal is always ACTIVE. That's what the curly arrow means in the state diagram. Anyway, let's roll with it.
Putting this mess of assumptions together, we get the following:
1. BIP-91 uses the soft fork deployment mechanism described in BIP-9.
2. BIP-91 redefines the BIP-9 "retarget period" to 336 blocks.
3. BIP-91 redefines the BIP-9 "threshold" to 80% (269 blocks).
4. When BIP-91 becomes ACTIVE (one 336-block interval after LOCK_IN), block filtering begins. Any block header in which version bit 1 remains unset will be considered invalid.
5. BIP-91 becomes inactive (undefined? something) when segwit state transitions to LOCKED_IN or FAILED.
I know there are those who will claim that the "code is the specification." But that world is receding into the rear-view mirror. To keep this experiment running, technical specifications must be treated with the respect they deserve. And that starts with writing specs that make sense in the first place.

With sufficiently low hash rate, segwit would fail to even lock in on UASF chain. Are you really saying that if it comes to this that a proof-of-work algorithm change would be one possible next step?
Segwit is a nice piece of technology, but there is a real possibility that it won't lock in on either Legacy or UASF chains. Should that happen, different groups would draw different lessons.
One lesson that I hope wouldn't get lost in the dustup is that complexity is anathema to updates on a running consensus system. And complicated updates in a politically charged environment yields a recipe for conflict.
The most valuable thing segwit delivers in the short term is to fix the longstanding malleability bug. This bug interferes with many forms of contract, including those that will drive the Lightning Network, forcing costly and hackish workarounds.
For better or worse, LN has become *the* vision for how Bitcoin will scale (absent a block size increase). The only problem is that there is no LN. And there won't be a practical implementation until malleability is fixed. All of the other nice things Segwit promises can wait - they're not nearly as important as conclusively testing the idea that LN offers a sane path forward for scaling.
If segwit fails to activate, it may be worth dusting off the other proposals for fixing malleability, such as BIP-140 (normalized TXIDs):
Even if segwit does activate, there is enough hostility toward it (and fear of it), that enabling an alternative malleability fix for base transactions might make sense.
@_date: 2017-07-19 12:14:05
Adapting a previous response:
This has to do with BIP-91:
This BIP and UASF (BIP-148) share a common purpose: to force activation of segwit with less than 95% hash rate support by rejecting any block that doesn't signal for segwit.  UASF has a start time on Aug. 1st. BIP-91 had a start time of June 1st. Both BIPs time out on Nov. 15.
Both BIP-91 and segwit use BIP-9, which is a protocol for enabling soft forks. BIP-9 repurposes the block header "nVersion" field as a sequence of 32 bits. Backward compatibility with previous upgrades forces the leftmost three bits to be set as "001". This leaves the remaining 29 bits for signaling updates that are "in flight" at the same time. Segwit uses the second to rightmost bit (bit one, aka 1&lt;&lt;1). BIP-91 uses bit 4 (fifth from right, aka 1&lt;&lt;4). Using the ASCII art made by we have:
    0010 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0001 0010
    \ /                              | ||| \ Bit 0: BIP68, already activated, so can be re-used later on.
     |                               | || \ Bit 1: Segwit

    softforking.                     |  \ Bit 3: nothing yet
    should remain                     \ Bit 4: BIP91 
    for compatibility.
BIP-9 has the details:
"BIP91 just hit the 80%" means that during the last run of blocks (unspecified) 80% had set the bit 4 version bit. The miners who did this are signaling their readiness to follow BIP-91.
BIP-91 uses a two-stage deployment mechanism.
Stage 1 is underway. When 269 of the last 336 blocks (80%) signal by setting bit 4, then stage 2 begins. This is a rolling window that resets every 336 blocks. So the OP is making the observation ("!!! WooooHooo") that unless something changes over the next 36 hours or so, BIP-91 will proceed to stage 2.
Under stage 2, any block that fails to set bit 1 will be rejected. 
This critical consensus rule is conveyed through the following tortured, grammatically invalid sentence - so I may well have misinterpreted it:


The reference implementation included in BIP-91 seems to agree with my interpretation. However, that code isn't exactly clear and seems to lack some important context.
I've seen the statement made that an additional period of 336 blocks is required before block censorship begins. However, I've found no documentation to this effect. As a result, it's an open question in my mind exactly when the censorship of blocks that fail to signal segwit would begin after BIP-91 locks in.
@_date: 2017-07-03 06:22:57


AFAICT, that's what Peter is suggesting.
He appears to be saying that the poor availability of witness data (it's designed to be pruned after all), combined with the prime directive of being first, coupled with the desire to earn fees in addition to block subsidy, opens an attack vector that doesn't currently exist. And that vector is to train miners to disregard witness data.

hardfork bit. Currently, blocks with this header bit setting to 1 are  
invalid, since BIP34 interprets nVersion as a signed number and  
requires it to be &gt;=2 (with BIP66, &gt;=3).
Looking at BIP-34, I see nothing about the nVersion field being interpreted as a signed number. But I noticed that BIP-9 makes a similar assertion. Was the signed-ness of nVersion an accident of BIP-34's implementation?
(As an aside, is the version field format big-endian or little-endian for the purposes of BIP-34? That small bit of information could I suppose be found by digging through source, but it seems like something that should be more readily available.)
About this part:


Not for me.

Electrum sends your master public key to the server it connects to. That allows the server to provably link all of your wallet's transactions together.
There are not that many Electrum servers. So, it's pretty easy to set a bunch of them up and link transactions of many users ("sybil attack"). That could be quite handy thing for a law enforcement agency (or blockchain analytics company) to do, for example.
If you connect to your own server, then your transactions are only linked together if you use multi-input transactions ("deterministic wallet"). You get the same privacy level as running Bitcoin Core, but you get all of Electrum's features, UI-driven offline signing being one of several.
There's also a security component ("spv security"). You know your server is set up properly and you audit it regularly. You know which chain your server follows. When the server says that a coin is unspent, you know with as much certainty as Bitcoin allows.

The main reason this is confusing is that there's never been a system like Bitcoin.
Most of the attacks that you've heard of simply don't work on Bitcoin. There is no central server to break into. There are no username or password databases to steal. There isn't even a way to prove your personal identity.
There are many places to begin to understand what exactly makes Bitcoin different. I can recommend two starting points:
1. Electronic cash (this is the step most people skip, leading to great confusion later):
2. Private keys (they're not passwords, but something much better):

I guess I hadn't followed the Wright episode as closely as I thought then. I dug up this reference to the existence of the key by Satoshi in 2010:


Which seems quite strange. The original question was:


Satoshi, having created and published a PGP key, references its existence but continues to authenticate his binaries with a plain MD5. He could have signed the binaries, providing much better proof of authenticity, but went with weaker security instead. Raises many questions.
Anyway, great work. It's interesting to think about the effect ubiquitous timestamping of digital archives could have in the future, and this work gives a glimpse of that.

This article, like many popular press articles, sows more confusion than clarity about Wright's identity.
The article claims, as others have, that Wright's PGP key was back-dated.


So what? A random person decided to publish a public key made to look like it had been created before it actually was. This may be good evidence of the person's intent to defraud, but I really don't care about the secret life of a technically-mediocre scam artist.
As points out, the real problem for those interested in Bitcoin and Wright's alleged connection to it is that he never published independently-reviewable evidence that he controls the private key linked to the public key posted on the bitcoin.org website years ago. For example, look at the bottom of this archived page:
A signature from that key would be strong evidence of Wright's claims. Not only was Wright incapable of producing this evidence for public review, but he was incapable of doing the same for the first block reward public keys.
Which leaves these possible explanations:
1. Wright is not Satoshi; or
2. Wright is Satoshi (or a member) but lacks cryptographic proof of his role; or
3. Wright is Satoshi but is deliberately trying to muddy the waters around his identity and involvement with Bitcoin.
Unfortunately, all three possibilities are still on the table given Wright's back-dated public key. That key is irrelevant to the discussion about Wright's role in Bitcoin. There may be hard evidence of intent to commit fraud, but it has nothing to do with Bitcoin.

BTC1 apparently sets version bits 1 (segwit) and 4 (BIP-91). Wu is claiming that Bitmain is running BTC1, but has disabled the segwit version bit.
Why is anybody's guess. Doing so runs the risk of mining stale blocks when BIP-91 activates.
My reading of BIP-91 is that filtering of blocks lacking the segwit version bit begins immediately after lock-in. Others have claimed there's a 336 block grace period, but I can't find that either in BIP-9 or BIP-91.
If none of this makes sense, this could help:

Although I appreciate the sentiment, the method being use here seems... well, recursive. The petition is supposed to demonstrate community support for BIP-148 -specifically the UASF variant. The call to action lists widespread community support for BIP-148/UASF as one of the reasons to sign the petition. If the latter were true, the former would be redundant.
I'm aware of no reliable method to ascertain "community support" for any Bitcoin upgrade proposal. UASF can be trivially gamed by spinning up Sybil nodes. BIP-9 cuts users out of the decision-making process. And every other voting mechanism runs on centralized platforms.
Meanwhile, node operators being urged to deploy UASF may not fully understand the risks they're taking by making a full commitment to the idea.

Maybe I'm not doing the math right, but it seems like you'd have closer to 19 quadruplings, or 19*2016 (=38,304) blocks, before difficulty catches up your rig's capacity. So those blocks will be mined on an accelerated schedule.
My laptop running 2.7 Mhash/second got ~2 blocks/h. If I ran 3x2.7 Mhash/second, then the next retargeting wouldn't change the difficulty. In other words ~ 8.1 Mhash/sec gives 10 minute blocks and stable difficulty (=1).
Your hash rate exceeds this by 1,000,000,000,000/8,100,000 = 123,000-fold.
4^x = 123,000 (how many quadruplings, x, are possible before retargeting doesn't change difficulty?)
x = 123000^0.25 = 19 retargetings
After ~38,000 blocks, you'll be mining at a constant average rate of ~6 blocks / hour on average.
There's almost certainly a more rigorous mathematical framework to put this into, and I may be messing up the arithmetic. But you will clearly be above the retarget rate for a significant period due to 4x throttling.

It's worth working through how exactly BIP-148 can fail because this is rarely discussed in all the hat-wearing excitement of the moment.
One way that BIP-148 can fail is if hash rate is too low to activate segwit in time. Specifically, UASF chain needs to generate a full retargeting period worth of blocks (2,016) between August 1 and November 15. If it fails to do so, the BIP-9 signaling algorithm will fail to advance the state to "LOCKED_IN":
If that happens, segwit won't activate at all on UASF chain. And if that happens, UASF coin will forfeit its threat of "wiping out" the Legacy chain. And if that happens, UASF chain would have no value over Legacy chain:
The prospects of UASF chain at that point, proof-of-work hard fork or not, would be very dim.

The patch itself could be introduced relatively soon. However, I wouldn't expect it to take effect for 1-2 years.
This is actually a hard-fork because it allows new behavior (larger blocks). Activating larger blocks immediately would set up a situation in which a fork in the block chain fails to resolve. That would be a disaster.
The problem with a big-bang hard fork update is that *everyone* needs to upgrade their software, and simultaneously - not just miners. It's not very likely to work.
The one previous case of a hard fork resolved itself essentially flawlessly because the change went live long after everyone had already updated:

The minimum relay fee is 1 satoshi/byte of transaction data. A transaction carrying a smaller fee is non-standard and so shouldn't, in principle, be relayed or added to a node's memory pool.
Yet, this forum has many posts by new users who attached no fee to a transaction that's now stuck. In many cases, these are small transactions unlikely to qualify for the priority-based fee waiver. AFAIK, these transactions should have been identified as non-standard and not relayed or added to the memory pool.
Why do nodes relay and add these zero-fee transactions to their memory pools in the first place?
Clearly the network is heterogeneous, with several versions running:
But my understanding is that, if anything, the relay rules have relaxed over time:

(2) may be difficult to detect given a sufficiently low UASF hash rate. You'd only be able to recognize it given a stale chain &gt; ~3 blocks long building only segwit-signaling blocks.
Here's where things get hairy. Imagine UASF chain starts off with 1% of the network hash rate on Aug. 1. No problem, GDAX says, we're open for business and all is well.
Three weeks go by and the UASF chain hash rate is up to 20% - and climbing. At this rate segwit will activate on that chain, and UASF chain will overtake Legacy chain within a few weeks. When that happens, all GDAX on-chain transfers will be wiped out.
Customers who withdrew on Legacy chain may find themselves without bitcoin. Customer who sold to GDAX would have their fiat, but GDAX may not have its bitcoin any more. Suddenly, nodes across the network would be inundated with far more unconfirmed transactions than the network can handle. And these transactions would have decidedly low fees compared to the market rate - so the probability of not being confirmed would be quite high.
All of which raises the question: when will it be safe to transact?

I'm not sure I outlined specific proposal, rather speculated that there may be some value in running a node that delegates some requests to peers. I'm not really convinced of it myself.
A fully validating node could speak WebSockets, in which case SPV in the browser would be feasible. Run as a downloadable app and the security model could be similar to Electrum/Stratum, or BitcoinXT. Privacy would be another matter, of course.
Either way, whatever SPV client you use can be connected to one or more delegating nodes. Whether WebSockets is being used or not, or whether the context is a browser running a downloaded HTML file or a full-fledged desktop app isn't really the main issue.
If you see specific vulnerabilities anyway, I'm all ears.

Here's my attempt to summarize (not sure I got it all right):
One way to enable millions of transactions per day is to attempt to scale the block chain and network around it. Another way is to build a network on top specifically designed with scalability in mind. That's what Lightning Network is about.
The proposal extends the hub-and-spoke micropayment channel system described here:
Under hub-and-spoke, the hub can steal the payment. However, the damage is limited if you're only sending a micropayment through the channel. If the hub refuses to forward the payment, you just disconnect and find a more trustworthy hub.
But hub-and-spoke can be used to solve a slightly different problem - keeping transactions off the block chain, yet securing them cryptographically and with enforceable contracts, and ultimately settling them on the block chain. The example of an exchange comes to mind.
With larger payments flowing through the channel, you need to trust the hub not to steal them. The Lightning Network solves this problem by making it impossible for the hub to spend the payment. The payer and intended payee negotiate an offset to the hub's key pair before making the payment. Only the intended payee can unlock the funds.
This is somewhat analogous to the way stealth payments work. Payer and payee negotiate an offset to a key pair. The payer pays to the offset public key, but can't unlock the payment. Only the payee can do that.
To get this to work, we need to fix malleability. Fortunately this can be done with a proposed "P3SH" soft fork. More here:

Thanks, I think this was the source of my confusion.
Following GetSerializeSize through to serialize.h, it looks like that function calculates the length, in bytes, of the transaction as if it were written to disk.
If so, why add 148 to the result of GetSerializeSize (the likely length of a P2PKH input)? 
It seems that GetSerializeSize should return the actual transaction length, in bytes, including inputs. These inputs should be signed, AFAIK.

Here's  a workaround that did the trick for me. From the Terminal application, type:

where &lt;hex&gt; is the hex field that you copy from the unsigned transaction. Before doing this, make sure your signing wallet has been set up.
Save the output from the console into a file. Then publish it with your online Electrum wallet.

SPV, in which a browser connects directly to the Bitcoin network, isn't possible. Browsers don't support communication over TCP, which is how Bitcoin nodes communicate. Browsers do, however, support WebSockets, which is similar.

Thanks, this was helpful. I think I have it now.
The identical set of chain split scenarios as those you outline can arise under a BIP9-style soft fork.
Imagine there will be a soft fork of some kind (not necessarily segwit). Blocks that were formerly valid will now be considered invalid.
Alice and Bob both run non-generating nodes. Bob upgrades, but Alice does not.
A dishonest (protocol-breaking) miner, Chuck, continues to generate legacy blocks. Alice accepts them but Bob rejects them. To Alice it looks like Bob is acting strangely (but honestly) by rejecting Chuck's block. To Bob, Alice is running a dishonest node by accepting Chuck's block.
The same situation can arise under UASF. Here, Bob supports UASF, while Alice doesn't. Chuck keeps generating legacy blocks, and we end up exactly where we were.
So I think my original question can now be turned around:
Imagine that, despite signaling for it under BIP9, 90% of miners continue to mine Legacy blocks. What will updated nodes do with all of the invalid blocks being generated by the hash rate majority?
@_date: 2017-07-05 01:17:26


Maybe it's the optimal solution when politics and technology are accounted for. It's a lot harder to block a bug fix (malleability) than it is to block an update that makes such sweeping changes (e.g., a new transaction format).
OP_CHECSEQUENCEVERIFY, which was also a fundamental building block for LN, was deployed rather uneventfully using BIP 9 (versionbits).
As for ASICBoost, segwit only prevents privately using this optimization/attack. It doesn't prevent publicly using it (via the version field of the block header AFAICT).

They exist because Bitcoin is an electronic cash system. Without the ability to recover change, the system wouldn't be much use.

Aside from IP logging, the other privacy leak with Electrum is that the server can link your addresses together. This neutralizes the main reason for seed mnemonics, disposable addresses, and deterministic wallets in the first place.
So in a sense, an Electrum server operator sees your transaction history as if you were re-using the same address for every payment.
One the plus side, the connection is encrypted, so eavesdroppers can't listen.
On the minus side, there aren't that many Electrum servers, meaning that letting Electrum pick one for you could set you up with an investigator. The investigator may not learn you IP address if you connect through Tor, but can potentially read your full transaction history with much more clarity than the rest of the network.
One solution would be for Electrum to adopt some form of noisy filtering. Bloom filters are used with BitcoinJ, Bread wallet, and others.
But Bloom filters have limitations of their own:
This is a very difficult problem with no easy answers.
One proposal I remember seeing is to make checking an address optional. In other words, the "balance" of an address would read 0 until you checked it, or tried to create a transaction spending from it.

Minor point: the network awards the block subsidy by accepting a block containing a coinbase transaction. No single individual does it - it's a collective effort.
That said, the computation miners are doing is actually pretty stupid and repetitive. The myth has spread that miners are "solving complex mathematical problems".
The process is much more akin to choosing a random number that the rest of the network can verify is the right one, but which nobody can peek at before it's guessed.
So far the only thing that process seems to be good for is mining altcoins, but most of them don't even use the same algorithm.

Lighthouse exposes a possibly unexpected economic effect from this donation model. Larger donations are favored over many smaller donations.
Transactions of more than 100,000 bytes in length are non-standard:
This means that larger transactions will be neither relayed nor mined into blocks by nodes running default settings.
The length of a run-of-the-mill input (donation) is ~150 bytes. This gives room for about 660 donations (transaction inputs) before all available slots have been filled.
The minimum relay fee for this transaction would be 100,000 satoshis, or 1 mBTC. Not a huge deal. In practice, the fee should be higher to ensure confirmation.
If every donor gave the equivalent of $50, that would mean the most that could be raised is $32,500. Dropping that to $5 gives a maximum of $3,250.
It seems that this style of fundraising disfavors small donations. Making room for a small donation means one fewer, valuable, slot for a higher donation. Alternatively, fundraisers could be broken up into A, B, and C rounds, etc.
That's not necessarily a bad thing, but it may come as a surprise.

Just speculating, but getting a handle on what the block chain is, what it does, and why it works is one of the biggest hurdles to understanding Bitcoin's potential and risks.
So a metaphor or mental model that can cut through the fog could help many more people understand Bitcoin on a technical level, elevating the discussion all around.
Setting aside one's views on global warming, I'm not sure it would have become the mainstream topic it is today without Al Gore and his slide deck. The greenhouse effect is just too abstract. That's the power of a mental model.

A recent thread discussed how the block size limit could be raised:
One commenter said that a mechanism similar to BIP 34 could be used:
In a nutshell, miners would vote their support for a change by starting to mine blocks with an updated version number. Instead of version n, they'd use version n+1. The requirements for this version would be spelled out in a BIP. Only after 95% of the last 1000 blocks used version n+1 would the new changes take effect.
A similar approach is being taken for BIP 62, which addresses several transaction malleability issues:
The other commenter stressed that a BIP 34-style approach would achieve nothing, re-iterating that BIP 34 was for soft forks only.
In the clearest terms possible, why would or wouldn't BIP 34 be suitable as a method for introducing block size increase?

Bitcoin uses a concept under the hood called chain of ownership. The idea is that the block chain records each owner of a coin as a it passes from user to user. This information is encoded by the chain of transactions. For example, Alice pays Bob, who then pays Carol.
Your scheme keeps your coins in the same chain of ownership.
A mixer breaks the chain of ownership. Specifically, you take over another user's chain of ownership. An investigator looking at the block chain goes off on a wild goose chase, in principle. In practice, mixers may give other clues. For example, the log file could be stolen or subpoenaed.
CoinJoin is another approach that works on a different principle. Here, you and a number of other parties cooperate to sign a single transaction redistributing coins. If done correctly, you don't need to trust the operator, and it's very difficult to follow the chain of ownership.

The hash rate has been surprisingly resistant to price decreases and block subsidy halving. It moves sideways, but rarely downward:
Over the course of the last year, miners experienced a de-facto halving from the drop in the exchange rate. Yet miners continue to mine, and hash rate continues to increase.
There's something going on here that not many people understand, myself included. But the data suggest that the halving of the subsidy will have little effect on hash rate.

As I continue to think of Bitcoin business ideas, one thing really sticks out:
Bitcoin replaces mediators with open source software and open networks/protocols.
We can all cheer that (and I do), but it becomes very difficult to create a viable business model in that climate. Cutting out the middle man means the middle man doesn't get paid.
It seems that this business idea falls into the same category. It's a great technology idea, but I'm not sure about it as a *business* idea.
The idea of increasing revenue 100% by cutting out the middle man (your company) would be very tempting to operators. When doing customer development around this idea, be sure to ask prospective operators about this.
The last thing you'd want to discover 12 months into this is that the company can only survive hand-to-mouth through crowdfunding.
Edit: the key to making something like work would be to provide operators with a service they need on an ongoing basis. For example, a potential user needs to be able to find services in their immediate area. That implies a kind of directory service, something your company could charge for.

Who says this is how fees would work?
The author demolishes a clearly unworkable top-down proposal for fees, and from this exercise concludes fees won't work.
A miner seeing a transaction that doesn't cover its costs to include it will simply ignore it. Let the user "defect" from paying fees all s/he wants. The miner cares not, and simply grabs the next transaction that does pay the fee it seeks.
If the miner's costs are too high to survive on the prevailing level of fees, it will go out of business, reducing difficulty and increasing profitability for those that remain.

False positive (fp) rate of 0.0224 (2.24% ?) seems unusably small, and not something that any sane software would default to. This suggests that if I made 100 equests, then 98 of them would be relevant to my wallet. Do I understand this correctly?
The idea of Bloom filters was to offer light wallets a trade-off between performance and privacy. Set the fp rate high to get more useless transactions within which your peer will obligingly bury the transactions you actually care about. Set the fp rate low to get better performance, but less privacy.
If so, why is such a low fp rate being used in the first place?  Is it too difficult to configure the filter based on available information?
A related discussion suggests it's a problem with configuring the filter:

The dust limit was lowered to 540 satoshis as of 0.10:
The second output is 1,000 satoshis. The transaction will be relayed and added to the memory pool by 0.10 nodes, but rejected by all others, who expect outputs to be &gt;5400 satoshis.
Given enough time, the transaction may be confirmed. If you know how to create raw transactions, you may be able to double spend without the dusty output.

No, Davis was quite careless.
Davis thought that it would be a good idea to outsource his bitcoin security to three pseudobanks. Davis thought they would keep his money safe. Davis ignored repeated warnings not to do this, and completely missed the lesson of the Mt. Gox disaster. In short, Davis didn't have a clue what he was doing.
Don't be Davis. If learning about how to secure your own funds turns you off, then Bitcoin might not be right for you - at least not yet. Bitcoin may well get there given time, though.
Until then, users really do need to be their own banks. For better or worse, that means acting like one.

I think that's what threw me. I've never seen a well-informed observer suggest that a top-down, hardcoded fee system would work.
The interesting disagreements revolve around whether a floating fee system would be able to buy enough security.
Re-reading the article, I think I see your point:


I've seen this stated a little differently. A transaction sitting in the memory pool, regardless of the size of its attached fee, costs essentially nothing to add to the next block.
Refusing to confirm a transaction with a lowball fee means leaving money on the table. So even unprofitable blocks are mined. Most miners will have no choice but to operate this way. Users know this and so are constantly pushing the lower limit, squeezing profit out of the system.
Is this where you're going?
Either way, looking forward to the next article in the series.

Check out proof of existence:
A hash is a one-way function that reproducibly transforms any digital document into a (large) number. It's impossible to predict the number, but easy to verify that the number is correct - just run the hash function.
Proof of existence lets you write a hash value into the block chain. Because each block contains a time stamp valid to +/- ~2 h, this proves that your exact document existed on or around the block's timestamp. The hash is encoded as OP\_RETURN data in a transaction contained in the block:
Notice that you can't do much just with the hash value. You need the document so that you can independently find its hash value and compare it with the value contained in the block chain.

In that case, it sounds like Bitcoin Cash is the first serious (?) attempt to create an altcoin that shares a common ledger, up to a point, with Bitcoin.

The current block size limit is 1 MB. Changing that requires a hard fork update, which has only been successfully pulled off once (0.8.1). Even then it was a very special case and was done in response to an existential threat that almost all technically-knowledgable observers perceived as imminent.
Hard forks are not easy to understand, or even reason about. That, combined with a lack of precedent makes them risky. If you don't see the risk, you should really sit down and think through all the ways a hard fork can go wrong - for those who go along with it.
The protocol was designed to make hard fork updates very difficult to carry out. Satoshi created a system that gives "honest" nodes that don't participate the upper hand. There's nothing anyone can do to change that home field advantage.
So the burden is on those proposing the block size limit increase to prove the case that Bitcoin is about to die.
They haven't done that yet AFAIK. When they do, the update will happen.

Good point.
Before the unidirectional (Alice-&gt;Bob) channel is funded, Bob signs a refund transaction giving Alice all the money in the 2-of-2 output. The refund is time locked so that Alice can't actually claim it for some mutually-agreed amount of time.
Alice needs this guaranteed refund to handle the case where Bob stops responding, loses his private key, decides to be a troll, demands extra money from Alice, etc. For this reason, Alice doesn't put any money into the channel until she has Bob's signature on the refund. Alice keeps the refund, but doesn't publish it.
This arrangement depends on Bob being able to publish Alice's last payment before the time lock on the refund expires. Bob can fail for several reasons, including a noncompetitive fee paid by Alice, network traffic spike, a mining cartel that only publishes empty blocks, generally full blocks, etc.
So the simple unidirectional payment channel case does illustrate the basic problem. Habitually full blocks (or situations that cause the cost of block space to fluctuate sharply) make payment channels vulnerable to refund attacks.

Before you can do that, you need to understand the double spending problem.
Before the double spending problem makes any sense, you need to understand electronic cash.

Ah, right - that makes sense.
To recap:
A transaction will only be relayed by 0.10 nodes running default settings if the value of each output is **greater than 546 satoshis** ("dust limit"). If this threshold is not met, the entire transaction will be rejected as non-standard. Nodes set their own relay policies, and so may adjust this limit up or down as they please.
The dust limit is modeled on a hypothetical transaction with one input and one output, and which unlocks its unspent output with a pay-to-public-key-hash (P2PKH) response script. The dust limit is 3 times the relay fee for this transaction.
To derive the dust limit, we must calculate the relay fee for the transaction. A rate of 1 satoshi/byte applies. The length, in bytes, of the transaction is calculated as:
transaction length = 148 + output length
(This calculation ignores a 10 byte overhead and +/- one byte uncertainty resulting from the exact format of the input signature.)
Outputs require 34 bytes if using a P2PKH challenge script. Plugging this value into the above equation gives a transaction length of 182 bytes (148 + 34). If a different kind of output challenge script is used (e.g., P2SH or multisig), its length should replace the value 34.
The relay fee rate for 0.10 nodes running default settings is 1 satoshi/byte. Therefore the relay fee for this hypothetical transaction is 182 satoshis.
Finally, the dust limit is 3 times the relay fee (3x182), or 546 satoshis.

If done right, CoinJoin is even better than a tumbler. A tumbler can steal money or log coin mappings. A variant of CoinJoin does away with the need to trust the operator, and obfuscates the flow of coins in such a way that nobody but the owner can tell for sure:


Whoever you pay with the shuffled coins knows that they came from what looks like a shuffle, but has little idea how to match with the original source. The trail becomes foggy.


If done correctly, the best you get is a probability of the coin's origin. The better the shuffle, the lower the probability.
@_date: 2016-07-02 23:08:25
It costs the same to compute the hash with or without transactions. The reasons are technically complicated (search "merkle tree", this video does a good job:  but the upshot is that the length of data on which hashes are based doesn't change. There's just a rather small up-front cost in building the merkle tree.
However, including transactions in a block that's published does have a cost. In general, bigger blocks means slower propagation from node to node. That, in turn, can lead to losing the block subsidy. Offsetting that risk is the value of the transaction fees.
All of which makes deciding a limit for the block size a very hard thing to do with any certainty.

This is a good example a leaky abstraction:
Transactions know nothing about addresses. That's a wallet-level concept built on top Bitcoin's chain-of-ownership concept.

The initial difficulty is hardcoded as 1. Difficulty increases are throttled at 4x.
In my own experiments, a laptop CPU mining from the genesis block using default chain parameters gave blocks on average ~25 minutes. The hash rate stayed consistently around 2.7 Mhash/second. You'd be able to mine ~400,000x faster, and maintain a higher rate for some time.
The 4x cap on retargeting increases would give you an extended period of time of blazingly fast block creation that diminishes over time. That should be part of any calculation.

Sometimes, two different inputs will give the same hash value output. For example, the SHA-256 hash values of "That's all, Folks!" and "ACME  Catalog" may just coincidently be the same. The probability is mind-bogglingly low, but not zero.
Likewise, two different public keys (with different private keys) can coincidentally give the same hash value. If this happens, the same address will be controlled by two different private keys.
In fact, this is guaranteed to happen. To get an intuitive feel for why, look at Steps  and  in the link. The number of bytes decreases from 33 (compressed public key, 32 bytes of x-coordinate + 1 byte flag) to 20 (RIPE160, which leads after a few steps to the address).
There are ~2^256 (2^(32*8)) public keys, but only 2^160 (2^(20*8)) addresses. Public keys outnumber addresses by a factor of ~2^96 (2^(256-160)). In other words, for each address, there are about 2^96 unique public keys, each of which (more or less) is controlled by a different private key.

As was OP_CHECKSEQUENCEVERIFY (CSV). It used the same version bits protocol and was locked in without a hitch:
Why was CSV deployment so uneventful while segwit seems to have stalled, and now we're talking about **persistent chain splits for a soft fork deployment**?
One reason is simplicity - or in the case of segwit, lack thereof. Segwit doesn't just fix malleability. It fixes a grab bag of problems, many of which have nothing to do with malleability. Yes, it's a wonderful piece of technology, but as an update to a running network in a politically charged environment -not so much.
Complexity is a valid objection to any piece of software, and especially to consensus software on the world's largest P2P e-cash system.
Maybe it's time to stop pointing pitchforks at miners and have a come-to-Jesus moment about segwit. Bitcoin doesn't need segwit. Bitcoin will be fine without segwit. Bitcoin still has many problems that segwit won't even come close to addressing.
What Bitcoin needs is a *scaling solution*. And at the moment, a second layer such as Lightning Network appears to be the best option.
Why don't we have LN yet? Many claim the reason is transaction malleability. I'm not sure I buy that given that LN will work, with reduced functionality, even without a malleability fix. Yet LN is still on the drawing board.
For those with investments of personal capital in segwit, this may be hard to see, but the best path forward after unsuccessful segwit deployment could be a straight malleability fix like BIP-140:
This would at least allow the debate to be settled about whether LN is a viable scaling solution.
But continuing to push for segwit deployment - even to the point of changing the proof-of-work algorithm or tolerating a persistent chain split - seems more than a little counterproductive.

Creating money in Bitcoin means that you must create a block. To create a block, you must prove that you finished an energy-intensive computation. Proof takes the form of a value you compute for your block that matches a predetermined pattern.
When you hear about miners "hashing", this is what they're doing. Trying to find a value that when included within a block makes its hash value match a predetermined pattern.
Without proof of finishing the computation, your block is invalid. Without a valid block, you can't bring new bitcoin into existence. All of your attempts will be ignored by the rest of the network, which can quickly and efficiently check your proof. It's a little like solving a Sudoku puzzle vs. checking that it's correct.

Not so much advice as understanding.
When I first heard about Bitcoin, I really had no clue how it worked. I thought I did based on my understanding of how local currency electronic payments worked. Then I applied that useless knowledge to Bitcoin. The hardest part was unlearning what I already knew.
There have been countless members of this sub who have set me straight on various technical issues over the years. Each time I think I've finally got it, I learn something else that forces me to question whether I actually did get it after all. Fortunately, these resets have gotten smaller and less frequent over time.
Probably my biggest misconception had to do with Bitcoin's cash-like nature. Contrary to what some assert, there are "coins" in Bitcoin. And they behave very much like physical coins. Except they have no material presence. And that gives them very useful powers.
After I figured that out, my ability to understand Bitcoin grew exponentially. The white paper actually made sense! But getting there wasn't easy.

Yes, that's what many *want* to hear. However, I'm not sure that's what they *need* to hear.
There's a tendency to think of Bitcoin as a mature technology that can just be used by nontechnical people with little to no training.
It's not.
Cars are, though. So are phones, as are personal computers (for the most part).
These mature technologies all started out as high-maintenance contraptions that few except the "ubernerds" could use.
Bitcoin is worse in some ways because it mercilessly lets you do very stupid things with your money and privacy. Things the traditional financial system protects you from, to a degree. Just look through newbie posts here and on to get an idea of the extent of the problem.
So whenever I explain how to get started with Bitcoin, it feels like I need to at least mention these points. Unfortunately, many don't seem to want to listen. I think this will be the case for some time.

I'm not sure. It seems like 5% would be within the average daily fluctuation in hash rate.
On the other hand, it sounds like many miners hover on the edge of profitability. 5% could be a big deal and well worth upgrading - or not. Especially if that means major updates to fabrication, and potential delivery delays.

Headers-first really does allow for faster syncing. In my tests using a 0.10.0 release candidate, I was able to fully sync from nothing in about 8 hours on run-of-the-mill equipment.
That same synchronization took many days at best previously.
If you're curious about how syncing used to work (blocks-first synchronization), check out:
tl;dr: All your blocks were coming from a single node (the "sync node"). As of this release, only the chain of block headers comes from the sync node. The block bodies are downloaded in parallel from all peers.

The key component of the attack (optimization?) is that rather than grind empty blocks and earn no fees, a miner can grind blocks with transactions while ignoring the signature validation step entirely. The miner can collect fees while disregarding transaction signatures.
In other words, no comparable situation exists today because a miner can't even produce a Merkle root without at least obtaining transaction signatures. With segwit, new mining strategies become possible and a new shortcut in which segwit signature data are disregarded could become profitable.

The closest thing to a hard fork update happened *after* the March 2013 chain split - in the 0.8.1 release:
The number of transaction IDs a block was allowed to reference was capped at 4500. A few weeks later, the cap was lifted. It's that second action that triggered the hard fork.
The March 2013 chain split itself is not considered a hard fork update. It only makes sense to talk about hard fork updates that change deterministic behavior. The block rejection pre-0.8.0 was non-deterministic.

Notice how none of these three conditions have an objective endpoint: "significant support"; "market sentiment"; "significant amount of other miners;" "rational."
Here's an outcome that ticks all of Bitmain's own boxes:
On August 1, Bitmain does nothing different. It commits zero hash power  to the effort (0% is "some percentage"). It publishes no blocks due to lack of "market sentiment" - concluding that doing so would not be "rational."
At the same time, Bitmain loses zero money and takes zero risk.
Notice how Bitmain could have taken a much more direct approach: start mining big blocks today. Announce it simultaneously. Bet the farm, win or lose. Commit every last bit of hash power to the effort and say goodbye forever.

Yes. For example, every private key has at least two easily identifiable addresses. One results from a compressed public key, and the other results from the uncompressed public key. Both addresses are controlled by the the same private key.
~~Hashing leads to further overlap, but it's much more difficult to identify those.~~

Absolute lock time (OP_CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY, aka CLTV, aka OP_HODL) has been a feature of Bitcoin since late 2015:
Here's how it works:
1. Find some bitcoin to lock away.
2. Send a payment to a custom P2SH address (begins with "3").
3. You won't be able to move the money until the time lock expires - even with a valid signature.
4. After the lock time expires, you can move the money again.
Coinbin supports this feature:

Hard forks in Bitcoin are especially risky because updated nodes can accept whichever chain has the most proof-of-work (barring some kind of checkpoint/blacklist which raises its own tricky issues).

Third option for miners: *stop* signaling segwit before Aug. 1.
One major problem with UASF is its lack of signaling method - it's all taking place through the easily-manipulated and cheap channels of social media.
We are left with the only piece of hard data - the hash rate currently signaling segwit (~30%):
That number will be watched very closely going into August. It seems unrealistic to think that more miners will actually *implement* UASF than signal segwit themselves. So the signaling percentage might be considered an upper bound for UASF support.
To prevent a potentially catastrophic exchange rate decline that a chain split would cause, a self-interested miner trying to recoup costs on a rapidly depreciating asset could conclude that the only winning move is to prove that a chain split is unlikely.
And that can be done by turning off the segwit signaling bit.
Notice that what users do here is mostly irrelevant. A non-generating node that implements UASF merely adds a little propagation to UASF blocks while doing a little filtering of Legacy blocks.
It's really generating nodes that only build on segwit-signaling blocks (and ancestors thereof) that will cause UASF to succeed (or fail). Users have little to do with it.
UASF is a way for a simple hash rate majority to bypass BIP-9's strict 95% consensus threshold.

It's not clear how (or why) block.io calculates the transaction fee. In most system's I've seen, the transaction fee is completely up to the user to figure out and pay.
Regardless, transaction fees on the Bitcoin network are levied on a per-byte, not per-unit-of-value basis. Spending more coins (unspent outputs) means paying more in fees. Spending fewer coins (unspent outputs) means paying less in fees.
So the two screens may represent two different customers - the first with many coins that are spent, and the second with few. But I'm not sure.

I find it helpful to drop the "smart" and just talk about contracts (or possibly "distributed contracts"). And every Bitcoin transaction is a contract. It's all based on Bitcoin's contract language called Script:
You're not alone about "smart contracts" though. Check out this video:
To summarize: any contract that interacts with the real world requires an *oracle*. This sounds mysterious but isn't. An oracle accepts requests to reveal a secret (or do something requiring knowledge of the secret) but only fulfills the request if certain conditions have been met.
For example, Bob is a rich man who wants to leave an inheritance to his daughter Alice using a contract. The terms are simple: when Bob dies, a sum of money will get paid to Alice's address.
Bob creates and signs a transaction paying Alice, and gives the transaction to her. However, the transaction is invalid because in addition to Bob's signature it also requires a secret. This secret will be revealed when Bob dies.
The Bitcoin network knows nothing about the lives and deaths of its users. That's where the oracle comes in - in the form of a "dead man's switch."
The oracle accept a request from anyone to reveal a secret. As long as Bob keeps checking in every month, the oracle will refuse the request. But if Bob fails to check in, the oracle will respond to the challenge by revealing the secret. The assumption is that if Bob doesn't check in he's dead.
As long as Bob is still alive Alice can't spend her inheritance. But should Bob miss one check-in with the dead-man's switch, the oracle will publish the secret on request and Alice can spend her inheritance.
Bob can get fancy here. For example, maybe he's worried that the dead-man's switch will get taken down or just become unresponsive. In that case, he can add a time-lock "loophole" to the redemption requirement. If some years have passed and the money hasn't been spent, then bypass the oracle and let Alice spend anyway.
Anything that involves an oracle will require trust of some kind, and I suspect lawyers will get involved as a result.
Also, you're spot-on about seeing escrows everywhere. Bob's inheritance is controlled by a kind of escrow. Escrows are a central component of most of the distributed contracts I know of.
There are more oracle examples here:
But contracts involving digital assets are a different matter. For example, Taaki and Todd developed a protocol (PayPub) that enables a leaker to get paid for leaking in a verifiable way - without involving outside parties or an oracle:
Distributed contracts also make an appearance in something that may not seem very contract-like: Lightning Network (or just bidirectional payment channels). This is a system allowing parties to exchange small off-blockchain payments without trusting each other. A chain of transactions is set up that allows either party to retaliate against the other for cheating by taking all the money in the channel. There is no mediator or oracle. Distributed contracts are the magic pixie dust that enable Lightning network. More on that here:

A good metaphor helps. Not many people use a good metaphor and jump into the deep end leaving the person they're talking to on shore and wondering what just happened.
Bitcoin is an electronic cash system. Pull out a dollar bill. Explain what you can give the dollar bill to someone else, who can give it to someone else, etc. You can't take the bill back except by consent of your counterparty or force. Hand the dollar bill to them, then ask for it back. Maybe mention wheresgeorge lets people voluntarily trace dollar bills:  
Any emotional responses? Any difficulty?
If so stop right there because you're going to get nowhere.
Now explain that Bitcoin works on the same principle, except that the bills (tokens) are purely digital. Many of the principles that people already know about cash (irreversible payment, scarcity, change, taggable, face value, etc) also apply to bitcoin.
You should get an immediate response of disbelief. After all, I can make as many exact duplicates of a file as I please. How can a digital token ever be made scarce?
If not, you're done. The person won't want to hear what comes next because they don't fundamentally understand money.

Short answer: no.
Long answer: Lightning works best when the transaction malleability bug is fixed. But it could work regardless:
Segwit rolls a bunch of updates, some of which fix malleability, and others that do unrelated things, into a single patch.
Many opponents to segwit have cited its complexity. And by any reasonable measure, it represents the most sweeping change to the consensus protocol in Bitcoin's history.
Segwit has unfortunately been marketed as a scaling solution in its own right, and as such has been swept up in the never-ending drama show that is the Great Scaling Debate. So a lot of the opposition is now political as well as technical.
 It's possible to fix malleability with a pure malleability patch, and this is likely to be much less controversial. Here's one way to do it:

You asked for solutions, and I offered one. Seems spot-on target to me. It may not be the solution anyone wants, but it may be the only one that will work.
UASF combines the uncertainty and confusion of a hard fork (persistent chain split; I just want to HODL, what do I do?; will my exchange do the right thing?; potential malicious attacks on the other chain; massive reorganization of a losing side; etc) with the complexity of an intricate new way of using Bitcoin (segwit). It's the worst of both worlds, despite segwit's technical merits.
@_date: 2017-07-14 00:34:16


Oops. Still, confusing the timeline for UASF and segwit2x is easy to do given the general lack of documentation for latter and comparatively good documentation for the former.




*sigh* - The author is supposed to have traded bitcoin and altcoins yet makes this kind of mistake.
@_date: 2017-06-06 02:23:20
Deploying UASF is not the same thing as signaling segwit. A miner can signal segwit but not deploy UASF, deploy UASF and signal segit, or neither signal segwit nor deploy UASF.
If 100% of miners signaling segwit today were to deploy UASF, then the UASF chain would have ~30% of the network hash rate. A miner deploying UASF would reject any block during the filtering period that didn't signal segwit.
However, 100% seems optimistic. More likely that some percentage of segwit-signalers will deploy UASF.
Either way, it's impossible to know for user what a miner will deploy after August 1.
There is one possibility that few seem to be considering, and that is that UASF could actually abort segwit. Miners, running the above analysis, realizing that a chain split is imminent, and recognizing that segwit will fail to lock-in, could decide to *stop* signaling segwit to calm markets and ensure continued high exchange rates and profits through August/Sept/Nov.

They must also maintain that majority over time. The point of BIP-9 was to ensure just that. By short-circuiting BIP-9, UASF (and the above proposal) increase the odds of a persistent, possibly oscillating chain split.
@_date: 2017-06-04 15:54:34


The odd thing about all of this is there's no way to know what's likely or not. All we know is that ~35% of blocks signal segwit. There's no way to know whether or not miners will implement UASF themselves.
We can speculate, but there are no data to draw on. Unless you know of something specific that's happened before, in which case I'd be very interested.
@_date: 2017-06-13 21:04:27


Yes. An unpatched node will accept blocks containing transactions that spend outputs from witness transactions because such spends are valid today. That's where backward-compatibility comes in.
As points out, transactions whose input scripts just push a non-zero value are non-standard so Bitcoin Core nodes will filter them. However, if a block contains such a transaction, it will be accepted and added to the active chain. Such transactions are valid, but non-standard.
~~This is why non-generating nodes don't need to update to segwit. They will accept any block containing witness transactions because they look valid (if unusual).~~
Edit: Nope. A witness transaction input has no script. So a Legacy node receiving a block containing a valid witness transaction will reject the block. The reason is that the witness transaction's input will be blank.
However, if a Legacy node receives another block that spends the same output with an input script that pushes a non-zero value, that block will be accepted.
@_date: 2017-06-15 21:17:32


It is if the miner believes the eventual exchange rate of UASFCoin will equal that of LegacyCoin.


The analysis starts with the assumption that the UASF chain would at worst be of equal value in terms of its functionality to Legacy chain. If that assumption doesn't hold, the conclusion goes out the window.
So, for example, a UASF that conducts a forced soft fork that raised the block reward would likely never get off the ground (although I can think of conditions where it would indeed work):
But the idea of a minority enforcing its will on the majority like this does seem like a bug. It's not "good for Bitcoin." At the very least UASF sets a precedent that could come back to bite in the worst way down the road.

You'll have to plow through to the end to see it, but this is actually a call to support Spoonnnet:
Unfortunately, the Spoonnet proposal lacks rationele or even statement of problem to be solved. Many grammar errors and structural problems make the proposal hard to understand (example: "A “backdoor” softfork the relax the size limit of Header 2 and Header 3"), so I wonder if that might contribute to the lack of discussion.
AFAICT, Spoonnet is a proposal to add a signaling mechanism for hard fork updates. It also appears, like segwit, to introduce a new block format. There could be something valuable here, but I'm not sure.

There are two components to the answer:
1. AML/KYC 
2. The block chain is forever.
Coinjar can (and probably must by law) trace your withdraws. You may not think that much can be done with this information, but the block chain is a financial investigator's dream. So many ways to uncover relationships between actors.

A miner must commit to the tip of either chain by including its hash value in the new block. The structure is:
block-1 &lt;- block-2 &lt;- block-3
Where "&lt;-" is an explicit reference to the previous block hash. See page 3 of the white paper (although I tend to think the arrows should be reversed). Regardless, the new block must explicitly point the the block it extends by placing its hash value in the header of the new block.
To answer your question - yes, a miner can mine 2 forks or dozens of them simultaneously. However, doing so dilutes the hash power available for any one chain. You can't simply add a block from one chain onto the tip of the other because the link in the chain will be broken.

Vague proposals often get quick buy-in. Everyone can agree to what they think the proposal says, because it does so little to offend (or inform) anyone. NYA is a good example of such a proposal.
- there is no BIP for Segwit2X
- there is no signaling threshold for Segwit2X
- there are no economic or technical consequences of reaching the signaling threshold
- NYA agreement software is still being written and hasn't been tested in its final form

Remember dialup modems?
This fee squeeze should be a wake-up call regardless of its cause. Nobody who actually uses bitcoin to make small purchases such as hosting (a very good use case BTW) wants to lose that.
You can look at this and conclude that Bitcoin has failed as a P2P electronic cash system.
Or... you could look at it as creating a bounty for a workable solution. Right now that solution appears to be alternative tokens such as ether and litecoin. I don't think that will last for long, though.
If the alternatives reach the same level of economic sophistication and scale as Bitcoin, they too will show signs of stress. They will all come face to face with the same problem: how to keep electronic cash fungible while scaling orders of magnitude.
This problem has been with Bitcoin since the beginning:
This is no easy problem, but the difference is that now there's a payoff for solving it.

Here's the diff specified in BIP-148:
It first checks that the median time past (MTP) falls within the block filtering period Aug 1 - Nov 15. If it does, the new `IsWitnessLockedIn` method is called. Otherwise, the method is ignored.
Other than that, there isn't anything I can see that would execute new code outside of the block filtering period. You could try to trick a UASF node into thinking the MTP is within the filtering period, and so execute `IsWitnessLockedIn`. But that appears to be a non-trivial attack.
Maybe Paul is just trying to get more people to review the UASF code.

AFAIK, the significance goes beyond the CSV update (which is plenty useful) in that this is the first soft fork to use the new update mechanism defined in BIP 9:
This system defines a threshold for activation, and a mandatory ~2 week waiting period after lock-in. That waiting period is about to expire on block 419328. Beginning with that block, checksequenceverify (BIPs 68, 112, 113) will be enforced. Blocks from miners who disregard the update will be rejected by the network.
Although every reasonable precaution appears to have been taken, no change to Bitcoin is without risk. For example, the BIP 66 soft-fork led to some excitement last year, but the CLTV update went off without a hitch:

Here's the only assumption about the value of UASF chain:
If UASF chain becomes dominant, its value will be at least equal to the current block chain. In other words, we assume that people don't ascribe segwit negative value when it's deployed. I know some will disagree, but that's a different discussion.
For now, let's assume that most people believe segwit is worth at least zero value to the Bitcoin network.
Imagine you wanted to buy UASF block rewards. How much would you pay? More importantly, how would you decide on a price?
The article gives the a stripped-down dollar bill auction as an example. How much would you pay for this here crisp one dollar bill? I hear one cent. Now two cents. Several minutes later a bidder offers 99 cents - and the game is over. There's no point on paying one dollar for one dollar, after all.
Knowing that the only outcome is a $0.99 bid, the game is decided before it begins.
Similarly, the UASF block reward auction begins at some low value (exchange rate). If *any* player believes the true value is higher, then more hash rate will appear.
When that happens, the value of UASF blocks increases. Why? Because UASF chain becomes more useful. If 2 blocks/day are being mined, twice as many transactions can be confirmed. So the UASF chain exchange rate increases. And this is the positive cycle. Hash rate drives exchange rate, a phenomenon that doesn't currently exist in Bitcoin.
Aha, you say, at some point the market could say UASF block rewards are worth less than they used to be. Maybe hash rate falls due to statistical fluctuation. Maybe something else. Doesn't matter. For one reason or another, UASF hash rate falls.
All that does is return the game to a previous state for another chance to run up. No matter how low the UASF hash rate drops, UASF block rewards will have the potential to be worth exactly what Bitcoin blocks rewards are today. For those who believe  UASF chain will win, it's like bidding $0.25 on a one dollar bill.
As long as UASF chain stays alive it has to potential to wipe out Legacy chain and in so doing, realize the full value of its block reward.
There are some external factors that come into play here. The biggest one is that the UASF hash rate might be so low that it can't actually activate segwit in time (by Sept. 15). In that case, the maximum value of a UASF block reward would likely be less that the current block reward. UASF would likely become an altcoin or just die. There's also checkpoints that could be added to prevent UASF chain from taking over past a point (and these are routinely added to Bitcoin Core).

Hurrah for innovation, but your post is confusing. This post fails to clearly explain what the outcome will be of using this technique, and what assumptions are in play. There are other problems as well.
A lot comes down to this whopper of a sentence:


Here's my best attempt at parsing:


I'm now assuming that Legacy chain is longer, even though it's not clear I should be.


Ok, this solution applies only when Legacy chain is longer and I'm trying to keep my transaction out of UASF chain.


Ok. I use an index-based nLockTime field that exceeds the index of the tip of the active Legacy chain. In other words, I'm not using a timestamp-based nLockTime value.


Huh? I thought Legacy chain was longer. How can the index of my nLocktime be greater than the largest Legacy chain index, but smaller than the largest UASF chain index?


Ok, I'm making a transaction that locks the output(s?) to a new address.


Wait, my transaction *won't* be confirmed because its lock time exceeds the index of the tip of the active Legacy chain. My Legacy time locked transaction may be hanging around the mempool, but it won't be mined until the time lock expires.


Now we get down to it. I will make *two* sibling transactions for double spending purposes. One tx is sent to UASF network without a time lock and the other is sent to Legacy network with a time lock. Only... how exactly do I keep my transaction 100% out of either network? Also, given a sufficiently low hash rate for UASF chain, my transaction sent there may not be confirmed for some time. How do I protect myself against that?


Wait, I'm publishing my transaction to UASF chain using *vanilla* Electrum/Mycelium? I thought Legacy chain was longer? Aren't those two wallets going to be following Legacy chain?
It's quite possible I'm just not getting what you're driving at. In a lot of these forking discussions I find that unless the author bends over backwards to be clear, concise, and consistent, then things get garbled very quickly.

This idea rests on the premise that miners want a 2MB block size limit so badly that they're willing to render their equipment worthless to get it.
That can be accomplished quite easily - without drama and without negotiation - by deploying a hard fork today and then promptly mining a &gt; 1MB block.
No miner has done this and none are planning to AFAICT. Which tells me that miners value stability more than bigger blocks - regardless of what various PR departments might be saying.

This interview highlights something that's become obvious over the last year or two. Bitcoin is an immature technology that's too often treated as a mature technology.
Mature technologies are invisible to users, who seldom know how or why the thing they're using works. Since the title mentions cars, the automobile is a prime example. It's a luxury to use a mature technology like a car. But in the early days you needed to be an mechanical expert to use one. Not much fun for the nontechnical, and quite risky.
A lot of the "problems" the Bitcoin community is accused of seem to relate directly to this problem. We're dealing with an extremely immature technology. Yet users too often approach (and promote) it as if it were mature.
This exposes users to manipulation by people with persuasive skills and an agenda. One manifestation is the con artist, who deliberately tries to deceive. Folks like Craig Wright understand this situation very well and can use it to great advantage. Another is the sincere non-technical user. And there's a spectrum of disinformation sources in-between.
This phenomenon was on full display during the height of the block size limit brouhaha. Time and again, users were dubious of the distinction between hard and soft forks, leading to dark conspiracy theories about why the limit wasn't being raised.
More recently, Lightning Network has been attacked as a Bilderberg-led plot to corral Bitcoin users into a centrally-run financial system.
This also plays out in daily personal tragedies like users failing to back up and losing large sums of money, or failing to understand the profoundly negative privacy consequences of combining AML/KYC with a public block chain.
In fact, the information asymmetry problem rears its head in just about any discussion of security, privacy, fungibility, extensibility, or incentives I can remember.
This will remain an issue for as long as Bitcoin remains an immature technology. Which could be a very long time.

Miners can set whatever fee policy they want. If they collectively ask for the same fee density for witness data as transaction data (why wouldn't they?) then you both could pay more or less the same price.

Why would a user who recovered the wallet care about the distinction between payments and change if not for the privacy implications of combining change outputs? It hardly seems plausible that they would remember many of the payment amounts and/or specific addresses anyway.


Contention can occur regardless of whether change addresses are separated from the rest of the address pool. All a users needs to do is simultaneously pull addresses from the same pool as the back end. In that case, a personal payment can end up inadvertently being credited as a customer payment. Separation of change addresses doesn't solve the problem, it merely eliminates one way for it to occur.

Better to avoid the need in the first place.
Don't transact with those who practice poor privacy hygiene. Don't reuse addresses - ever. Avoid combining two coins in the same transaction. Donate low-value coins to charity. Never publish a static tip address. Be careful of what information you ask from websites (e.g., Blockchain.info). Use Tor to avoid linking your IP address to a transaction or information request.
None of these things are illegal - and they're all in you best long term privacy interest as a Bitcoin user.

I was hoping this would be a technical discussion about risks/rewards of a UASF and/or segwit in particular. Unfortunately, it turned out to be something more focused on personalities.


Maybe, just maybe, the real culprit isn't a specific person, company, or group, but the protocol itself. Nothing guarantees that Bitcoin will evolve or even *can* evolve at this point. The protocol itself was designed to resist change and economically punish those with the gall to try it. Network effects compound this conservative stance.
When Satoshi left, so did the Benevolent Dictator model of Bitcoin development. Gavin tried to resurrect it and was cast aside. Bitcoin Core has now been joined by half a dozen competing implementations, threatening the "Core Developer" identity and influence. Each of these milestones has made Bitcoin harder to change.
Perhaps ironically, that's why most users were attracted to Bitcoin in the first place. Decentralization means you're probably not going to get your way.

Some back-of-the-envelope calculations about a full node running under these conditions - assuming no segwit and no pruning:
- 100-200 transactions/second are processed
- 1.7 ~~petabytes~~terabytes/year of data are added to the block chain
- 1.2 terabytes/day of data are transmitted ([link](
- 96 bitcoin/block in transaction fees are generated (assuming 300 satoshis/byte)
As for what to do... At this point there would have been at least one but probably several hard forks. So up we would have to go again - to 64 MB blocks.

Oddly enough, that appears to be possible - through a soft fork no less:
The idea is for a hash rate majority to execute a time warp attack, accelerating block production - without triggering a corresponding increase in difficulty. Clearly, Vitalik is just blowing off steam here, but the idea is intriguing nevertheless.
A clear motivation for such an attack is to accelerate the block subsidy schedule - at the possible expense of future network security.

To summarize: segwit deployment on an accelerated schedule replacing 95% version bits signaling threshold with 65%.
At that level, I can't help but wonder whether this lowered threshold would lead to a chain split anyway.
Segwit's main selling point was that it could offer a major update without disrupting the network. That was possible because it was going to be deployed as a soft fork using a strong 95% consensus threshold.
Part of the bargain was that if that level of signaling was not reached, the deployment failed.
Proposals like the one here and UASF challenge the very premise on which segwit's current implementation is built. Instead of an upgrade with very little risk of a chain split, we're more likely than not to have one.
Under these conditions, segwit might as well be deployed as a hard fork. At least then, the update need not trip over itself trying to maintain backward compatibility.

Yes. The typical Alice-pays-Bob "P2PKH" authentication script adds the hash of your public key to a transaction's output script:
    OP_DUP OP_HASH160 &lt;pubkeyhash&gt; OP_EQUALVERIFY OP_CHECKSIG
Your public key is not revealed until you spend the output. The public key is encoded within an input script of your transaction:
    &lt;signature&gt; &lt;pubkey&gt;


An input that references an output must spend it in its entirety. In other words, there is no way to partially spend an output. It's either spent or unspent.
Multiple outputs can be locked to the same public key hash. That's why some addresses appear to have multiple outputs "in" them. Nevertheless, each output is referenced by the unique combination of output transaction id and index. "Address" doesn't really enter into the process. Outputs are locked to an output (challenge) script, not directly to an address.


Yes - to an extent. Even if you sign a text file, your public key and its counterpart of opposite y-value can be deduced from your signature. One of the two public keys will be yours:

There are approximately:

With such a sparse distribution, however, it's no use trying to find collisions deliberately.

Segwit isn't worth splitting the network over. It's not worth the drama, and it's not worth the confusion this whole episode has generated or will generate before long. Segwit is a wonderful piece of technology, but there's nothing in there that rises to the level of must-have at any cost.
I like segwit and want it to be deployed, but I like network cohesion better. What UASF proposes is no better than a contentious hard fork in terms of potential for network disruption.
The most valuable part of segwit is the malleability fix. Malleability is a bug that prevents many useful forms of contract, including those that may/will power Lightning Network. However, segwit is a grab bag of many different features, some of which raise legitimate technical concerns.
Rule  regarding the upgrade of running widely-used consensus systems: keep it simple. This applies even more so when the change is contentious as segwit clearly is. Just because it's a soft fork doesn't exclude it from passing the contention test. And segwit fails this test by any objective standard, not the least of which being BIP-9 signaling. OP_CSV was successfully rolled out using BIP-9, something UASFers seem to ignore, precisely because it was useful, simple, and uncontroversial.
It seems very unlikely at this point that segwit will activate on its own. When the lock-in deadline elapses without 95% signaling, segwit should be tabled indefinitely. Parts of it can be used in the future if appropriate.
In the meantime, a malleability fix needs to be deployed. If segwit won't work then there are others, such as BIP-140, to choose from.

To claim the subsidy (reward), a miner creates a special transaction called the "coinbase transaction." This has nothing to do with the company called Coinbase.
A coinbase transaction is unusual in that it has no payer. The miner gets to create money out of thin air (in addition to claiming all fees in the block of transactions they verify).
A miner accepts the Coinbase transaction of any other miner, provided that the block of transactions it's in follows the rules of the protocol.
One of those rules is that the block must contain a "proof-of-work." Obtaining this proof requires the consumption of energy and computational power.

It may be useful to take a few steps back and consider what all the fuss is about.
Bitcoin has a scaling problem. It's been there from the beginning. The very first published response to Satoshi's white paper sums up our current predicament pretty well:






 
The more successful Bitcoin becomes, the more oppressive this very old problem becomes.
There are now two entrenched camps when it comes to scaling: (1) hard fork block size increase; and (2) segwit. Recently, a split-the-difference idea has emerged. They all seem equally likely to fail in my view.
Segwit is having trouble for two reasons: (1) it's the most radical change to the protocol ever; and (2) by itself it's not going to provide much relief from stuck transactions and high fees in the medium term.
The nugget within segwit that does have broad support is curing malleability. This is the last remaining technical defect that permits a clean, smoothly-running Lightning Network.
LN is a scaling solution that addresses the concern about ever-growing block chain size head-on. It does to so by enabling a secure path to move many (even most) transactions off-chain.
So, one way forward would be to admit that the Bitcoin user base in general may not be ready for either a hard fork or segwit.
Fortunately, there is another way.
BIP-140 fixes malleability - without the other ambitious goals of segwit. There may be other BIPs like it just laying around - squeezed out by the segwit/hard fork/UASF ruckus.
Let segwit fail to activate. Don't start down the risky path of ad-hoc hard forks. Avoid the temptation to seek meatspace consensus through slit-the-difference negotiations.
Then, activate a malleability fix that just eliminates malleability. Give LN proponents the ability to build the second-tier scaling solution of their dreams, and impress us all with it. If it fails, then hard fork we must.
At least that's one path forward that doesn't seem to have been given the consideration it deserves.

Under current protocol an output locked segwit style must use a challenge script with the following format:
    &lt;version&gt; &lt;witness program&gt;
Normally, an output's challenge script sets an expectation of some kind such as the public key that needs to sign. But the one above just pushes data. If an output script like the one above were encountered today, it could be spent by a response script that just pushed a nonzero value to the stack. This kind of output is known as "anyone-can-spend":
This is how the soft fork update manages to keep witness transactions backward-compatible. Segwit requires any transaction with an output like the one above to only be spent under the new rules of segwit, not the old rules of anyone-can-pay.


Ignoring witness transactions using anyone-can-pay outputs would disrupt coin chain-of-ownership. This is the only mechanism nodes have to determine whether a coin is valid or not. Not only that, but ignoring a transaction that is currently valid would itself require a soft fork.
Imagine a transaction that spends the output from a witness transaction. It too must be "ignored" and so must all descendants for consistency. If you were the recipient of a coin with witness transaction ancestry, some nodes would refuse to honor it as a valid input.

Ironically, that only happens if generating nodes (i.e., miners) themselves implement UASF - at least as far as I can tell.
I think about UASF this way. A UASF node is making an offer to the network. It will help propagate a block, but only if it carries a segwit signaling bit. Whether or not a miner accepts this offer depends on how highly it values the additional propagation capability.
Back to the scenario. The Legacy (non-UASF) chain becomes stale only if the UASF chain (nothing but segwit-signaling blocks during the filtering period) grows faster. That means that a hash rate majority must itself implement UASF filtering and only build on segwit-signaling blocks.
In effect, a UASF-patched miner makes a much stronger proposal to the network. I will build on your chain, but only if all of its ancestors signal segwit (as of Aug. 1). Whether the rest of the generating nodes accept the offer depends on how highly they value their own blocks being extended by the hash power implementing UASF.
So, the only way I see the Legacy chain being overtaken by the UASF chain is for miners themselves to opt into UASF and filter non-segwit signaling blocks. Just signaling segwit won't necessarily make the Legacy chain stale. Notice that if a hash rate majority itself deploys UASF, then segwit activates because 100% of blocks will carry the signaling bit.
Which leaves us right back at square one. UASF will succeed or fail based on whether miners themselves deploy a UASF patch. "Users" still don't get a say.
In other words, UASF appears to offer a way for a simple hash rate majority (&gt;50%, but possibly less) to enact a version bits proposal that on face value requires 95% signaling. All the talk about running a non-generating UASF node, although inspiring, won't make much difference if the hash rate majority doesn't themselves deploy UASF.

Article fails to mention that in the last six months, network hash rate has doubled, which equates to the same overall effect for miners as halving the block subsidy:
In other words, miners will effectively experience one extra hash rate doubling on top of dozens that have already occurred. Assuming this is the only factor at work, then the effect on nominal network hash rate should be close to nil.
The change to the exchange rate could be more interesting. Assume miners immediately sell every bitcoin earned through subsidy. Also assume the percentage of bitcoin for sale each day due to mining is β%. The subsidy halving will then abruptly remove 0.5*β% of bitcoin from the market sell side.
To understand what will happen to the price you need to know two things:
1. the value of β
2. whether the exchange rate already reflects the pending cut
I don't recall seeing any estimate of β before. As for whether the cut is already priced in - there doesn't seem to be any way to tell.

No, my original response to OP contained a major error (now struck through). A UASF node will never reorganize to the Legacy chain, regardless of how much proof of work it has.
UASF is a one-way exit for the nodes that implement it. There are two possible major outcomes:
1. Legacy chain grows faster.
2. UASF chain grows faster.
UASF will ignore Legacy chain effectively forever. It does not matter to UASF nodes how quickly the Legacy chain grows. If either (1) or (2) comes to pass UASF nodes just don't care.
Legacy nodes will ignore UASF chain as long as it remains shorter. If, however, UASF chain overtakes Legacy chain, Legacy nodes will experience a (possibly lengthy) reorganization and adopt the UASF chain. This could be very messy.

Your concerns (except for the one about being backed by the dollar) seem valid.
Every time you read about a merchant immediately converting the BTC they receive into USD, your first two points are validated.
But the number of merchants accepting Bitcoin has shot way higher this year. It may not come to pass, but should that trend continue for a few years, we'll reach a point when people start to denominate the daily events of their life in BTC.
At that point the discussion would revolve around the instability of fiat currencies, not Bitcoin.

This sounds like a regulatory compliance problem for Coinbase.
User places order for goods on a dark market, gets payment address. Then user applies this address as refund for an order on a Coinbase merchant. User later requests refund. Coinbase obliges by sending payment to dark market directly. Similar to ("Silkroad Trader" refund attack: 
It's seems that Coinbase's AML/KYC compliance burden could widen as a result of this feature by forcing those buying goods through a Coinbase merchant to hand over more personal information. Or by Coinbase collecting/sharing it without the user's knowledge.
I'm not saying that this attack makes a lot of sense for the attacker, although in some cases it might. But the refund feature does open the possibility, and Coinbase has shown a hyperaggressive stance on such issues.

Today we know that ~30% of hash power is signaling segwit:
I assume that won't change before Aug. 1 and I further assume 100% of segwit signaling miners will themselves support BIP-148 and refuse to mine atop a non-signaling block (an optimistic assumption, but let's go with it). That gives UASF-chain about 30% of the current network hash power.
On Aug. 1, UASF hash rate would be watched very closely, I imagine, for any sign of change. Small statistical blips (upside and downside) would be blown out of proportion through social media frenzy. A single mid-level miner could dramatically change the prospects of UASF-chain either way.
Nevertheless, BIP-148 chain starts at a disadvantage because of the low probability of Legacy nodes reorganizing onto UASF-chain.
So here are some ideas:
1. Hash rate of BIP-148 chain decreases. Pick a reason: statistical downside blip; mid-level miner gets cold feet and leaves; lack of liquidity due to poor exchange support. This will be a game of momentum for good or bad.
2. Buyers of coins mined on BIP-148 chain demand a discount, worried about hash rate drop and frustrated by poor liquidity.
3. Some fence-sitting miners on BIP-148 chain abandon it, unable to mine profitably given the discount, and attracted by the (temporarily) reduced difficulty on Legacy chain
4. Exchanges, miners, and users begin to get cold feet as they see a reorganization onto Legacy chain become ever more unlikely
5. Talk of ad-hoc hard forks to fix the difficulty problem and severe lack of block space spook still more fence-sitters, who decide that UASF isn't really for them after all. 
6. GOTO 1
I appreciate that a similar scenario (with the additional threat of impeding reorganization) applies to Legacy chain. And if segwit signaling were in the 70% range instead of where it was now, that scenario would seem more likely.

Electrum works on a different model than, say, BitcoinJ-based wallets such as Bread and MultiBit. These wallets talk directly to regular, fully validating nodes, and those scale with well-known properties.

This is, in a nutshell, the problem I have with all such analyses. They are themselves speculative and chock full of assumptions about human behavior and future technology.
It's also why the hot discussion blowing around segwit is such a problem for Bitcoin. We can test out the LN idea with a simple, uncontroversial malleability fix such as BIP-140. Segwit is overkill, and its intersection with the scaling debate has saddled it with what may be irrevocable political baggage.
LN should be built regardless of the oversimplified arguments in this article. Unfortunately, the lack of a malleability fix today gives cover to LN proponents: LN isn't ready yet because segwit isn't deployed (never mind this isn't quite true).
Bitcoin needs to remove that cover ASAP and let the chips fall where they may on LN.

The exchange rate and transaction fees may influence each other in non-obvious, counterintuitive ways.
It's been surprising (for me at least) to watch fees remain in the 200-400 satoshi/byte range while the exchange rate quintupled. It seems plausible that system-wide misestimation of fees (coupled with non-stop spam attacks) might account for some or most of this.
To a first approximation, fees should decrease as exchange rate increases, but instead, fees look quite sticky on the upside when measured in satoshis/byte. The missing puzzle piece is the extent to which higher exchange rate leads to more transactions flooding the network (and so accounting for the rise of fees in dollar terms). We can no longer use the block chain to count transactions like we used to because blocks are now almost always full. So we must look at unconfirmed transactions. I haven't seen anything on that, though.
Maybe, as the article suggests, high fees are encourage hodling in the same way that Mt. Gox's shutting down fiat withdraw near the end may have caused an exchange rate spike.
The article talks about "attrition" (the process of completely consuming a coin in fees), but there's also another process at work. The face value of an output can drop below the cost of confirming it. These negative value inputs will not be spent by rational users. The net effect is to contract the money base. Even worse, this is a moving target that obliterates user value as the market fee density increases. Hopefully, wallet makers are on top of this and won't allow users to spend negative value outputs.
But that still leaves the question of what to do with outputs whose effective value has fallen below zero.

Condensing this down a bit and following some points through:
Even if UASF chain starts off with 1% of the hash rate, it will win in the end. This follows from these factors, which only need to be perceived as true:
- UASF chain hash rate will be &gt;0% as of Aug. 1
- the exchange rate for non-dominant UASF chain reflects, in part, hash rate
- the exchange rate for dominant UASF chain will be greater than or equal to the exchange rate for dominant Legacy chain because UASF chain has segwit
- UASF chain obliterates Legacy chain when UASF hash rate exceeds 50%
- Legacy chain never obliterates UASF chain
Imagine UASF chain starts at 1% hash rate. It's barely usable at 1 block/day. Its exchange rate is correspondingly low -let's say $1/UASFCoin.
Knowing the outcome of this game, several obsolete mining rigs get dusted off and pointed at UASF chain. Hash rate doubles to 2%. 2 blocks/day makes UASF chain twice as useful. UASF chain exchange rate doubles to reflect this ($2/UASFCoin). Early investors just made a 100% return.
Smelling opportunity, speculators plunk spare funds into UASF chain, driving its exchange rate to $4/UASFCoin. Early miners are now making double what they used to.
And so on until UASF chain extinguishes Legacy chain. When this happens the exchange rate for Legacy chain drops from whatever it used to be to $0/LegacyCoin.
Notice that the starting UASF hash rate can influence the length of the game, but not the outcome. Also notice that any drop in UASF hash rate during the game will be followed by another rise.
Knowing this is how things will play out, the winning move is to begin mining and investing in UASF chain from the beginning, thus bringing the predetermined outcome to fruition that much faster. In the extreme case it would happen within a single retargeting period.
@_date: 2017-06-12 17:52:52


Bidirectional channels work best with a malleability fix, but don't require one:
Segwit is but one approach to fix malleability. For example, BIP-140 fixes malleability in a much more restricted way:


Before concluding that scaling is a segwit-or-bust proposition, it may be worth considering a less politically-charged path forward that just fixes malleability. Segwit is amazing technology. But its unfortunate branding as a scaling solution in itself has ensnared it in a rat's nest of political issues.
Before long, something like BIP-140 that just fixes malleability may begin to look appealing.

The advantage of this approach is that it does one thing and one thing only: fix malleability. And it does so in a backward-compatible way. This could pave the way to a clean Lightning Network implementation.
By avoiding the topic of scaling altogether, BIP-140 may appeal to those who want to see an on-chain scaling solution but don't like how segwit does it.
Segwit has, unfortunately, branded itself as a malleability fix wrapped in a scaling solution.
Should segwit fail to activate, I suspect BIP-140 will start to look mighty attractive.

The article claims a UASF node faces only one risk:


But this is a compound risk. Imagine the hash rate for the minority chain starts strong (35%). But over the course of several days the hash rate drops to below 5%. There are a couple of reasons. First, buyers demand a discount on freshly-mined coins due to the risk of mass abandonment. Second, fees and confirmation delays are accelerating upward due to even more constrained block space.
What will you do? You are effectively barred from transacting because no blocks are being produced. Retargeting may be weeks away. Rumors of hard fork ad-hoc fixes abound.
Unless you're a miner, the only viable option if you need to transact will be to revert BIP-148 and begin accepting the Legacy chain.
Call it a user-activated reorganization. Whatever it's called, it's similar to the risk claimed to apply only to Legacy nodes:

Very misleading title. All that's happened is that the pool has mined a block that signals segwit. About 1/3 of blocks are doing so, and this has been happening for a while:
There is no such thing as a "BIP148 block." There are only blocks that signal for segwit using the version bits protocol, and those which do not. BIP 148 will cause a node to filter any block that doesn't set the segwit version bit during the filtering period (Aug 1 - Nov 15):
~~If we were in the filtering period today and there were no change in segwit signaling, and generating nodes didn't themselves implement UASF, then UASF-patched nodes would reject 2/3 of the blocks produced by the network. This would put them on a minority chain until the end of the filtering period.~~
~~It's important to realize that the filtering period ends no later than Nov. 15 regardless of whether segwit has activated or not. As such BIP-148 may constitute a soft fork followed by a hard fork. The soft fork narrows the protocol by requiring a version bit starting Aug. 1. The hard fork broadens the protocol by allowing blocks without the version bit as of Nov 15.~~
~~Assuming no change in segwit signaling at the end of the filtering period, then a large reorganization for segwit-patched nodes will occur after Nov. 15 as they once again join the main chain - wiping out all UASF-chain transactions including coinbase. "UASF-coin" or whatever it would be called would cease to exist. This reorganization is hard-coded into UASF and follows deterministically from minority segwit signaling.~~
~~Non-UASF nodes may observe a drop in hash rate - depending on whether or not generating nodes also reject non-segwit-signaling blocks. Otherwise, they would be unaffected by UASF. The degree to which generating nodes will themselves implement segwit remains unknown.~~
Edit: I goofed on the crossed out part. Thanks to for setting me straight. In a nutshell I was missing the part about UASF that requires all blocks on the active chain timestamped between Aug. 1 and Nov. 15 (determined by "median time past") to carry the segwit signaling bit. This restriction applies indefinitely. Therefore, a UASF node will not reorganize to a chain in which even a single non-signaling block dated within the filtering period occurs.

Interesting way to think about it. Like any commodity, the price we pay depends on supply and demand.
Unlike most commodities, however, the producer (miner) can't increase production (of block space) when prices rise. In that sense, the price discovery mechanism for block space doesn't work like it does for sugar or other commodities from everyday life.
Instead, we have a serial monopoly where the monopolist is chosen by lottery. Buying more tickets can increase the chance of winning, but it doesn't allow the winner to increase the production of the underlying commodity.
It's interesting to think of other markets that might have similar dynamics, but they don't seem very common.

I was overlooking the definition of `nMedianTimePast` in the reference implementation:
    int64_t nMedianTimePast = pindex-&gt;GetMedianTimePast();
`pindex` is a pointer to a `CBlockIndex`. This line is part of the `ConnectBlock` method, which attempts to connect a block with its parent. If the "median time past" of the block lies within the filtering period, then a check for version bits will be made. "Median time past" appears to be the median timestamp for the previous 11 blocks.
Which would mean that any block that builds on a block (or ancestor) that didn't signal segwit during the UASF filtering period will be permanently invalidated.

This gets confusing fast, but you're looking at something called "change." Bitcoin is an electronic cash system. This doesn't mean what you may think it means. It does mean that Bitcoin works like cash (bank notes and metal coins). And that means that change is produced from may transactions. More here:

Bitcoin's mathematical guarantees around double spending protection only apply to confirmed transactions sitting in a block on the block chain. Unconfirmed transactions have completely different model, which is significantly weaker in every sense.
If you release goods or services in exchange for unconfirmed transactions, you're taking a risk that your payer won't turn around and double spend on you. If you manage to convince a merchant to give you goods or services in exchange for an unconfirmed transaction, they are trusting you to some degree.

A good idea, but the implementation runs into the weeds. Imprecise language is the main problem. Take, for example, the division into Users and Miners:


These terms are used, without definition, throughout the rest of the article. We can't take the intuitive meaning of the distinction (hashers vs. non-hashers) because of stuff like this:


Users have 0 hash rate. A node that doesn't mine does not grow the chain. Period. A full node can propagate or filter blocks. People can act on what a node tells them. But that's about it.
Another example: confusing "chain split" with "soft fork update."
Nor does the article explain the subtle, yet critical, difference between a generating node that signals segwit and a generating node that itself implements UASF by only building on signaling blocks.
Which leads to a blind spot in the scenarios department:
Miners (hashers), sensing an imminent, catastrophic loss in exchange rate during Aug 1 - Nov 15, and given the likely failure of segwit activation, decide to *stop* signaling segwit as a way to reassure Bitcoin's economic majority that there will be no chain split.

I've also noticed how the speed of synchronization seems to slow down exponentially as Bitcoin-QT gets closer to getting up to date.
The explanation I see most commonly has to do with the speed of the P2P network, which does not explain why the darned thing slows down right near the end.
To the extent that the slowdown results from transaction validation, you might be able to hack a solution with your miner and some custom software. Whatever you come up with would be of interest to a lot of folks who are trying to find some use for old mining hardware.

Terrible story, but he's not alone by a long shot:
I'm going to go out on a limb and suggest that the author still doesn't understand his mistake - buying too much bitcoin before understanding it.
No noobie want to hear this because understanding Bitcoin is not easy, quick, or smooth. It's a grueling slog of two-steps-forward-and-three-back through your own misconceptions and ignorance about money, math, and trust. It can take years.
And during that whole time, Bitcoin is heading to the moon - or so it seems. Why not just buy it now, and then let the education part work itself out in due course?
The author followed this plan, and indeed received the education he needed, but at a very high financial and emotional cost.
Make your first bitcoin purchase small enough to laugh about if you lose it all. Then use that bitcoin to teach yourself how to manage your own money. Develop a plan to do just that, and practice it until it's second nature. Ask for feedback along the way.
You're going to lose it all at some point. Fear not, make another small purchase and continue your education. If bitcoin is a good investment today, it will still be a good one in two years.

That's a very good question. The answer probably depends on what exactly caused the failure. For example, if it were an unresolvable technical failure, the altcoin with a solid solution might look very attractive indeed.

Interesting idea.
Any country with a large trade surplus with the United States (e.g., China) has a problem: how to store all those dollars. They often don't want to convert to domestic fiat because that would raise the value of their own currency, making imports more expensive for US customers.
China doesn't want to buy stuff from the US, because that hurts its own exporters. So for some time China has been plowing the money into US Treasuries. But recently China has been making noises that its looking for an alternative.
Were China, or any net US importer, to start to see bitcoin as an alternative to the US dollar for a place to park a significant percentage of trade surplus, the result would be a watershed moment in world history.
As for the price, we can only speculate. I suspect we'd look back with nostalgia at being able to buy an entire bitcoin for less than $1K.
But even more than price increase, such an event would transform bitcoin and the world itself in ways few could predict.

I'm not sure what the issue is here. Block filtering won't begin until August 1.
Assuming this isn't a prank, the only conclusion I can draw is that he's found an exploit that can be run right now on UASF-patched nodes.
Edit: original tweet taken down, but the discussion continues:




So now I'm out of ideas about what he's referring to. It should be pretty clear to anyone who's studied UASF that patched nodes will split from the main network during the block filtering period of Aug 1 - Nov 15.
Oddly enough, patched nodes will also rejoin the network, regardless of whether or not segwit is locked in, after Nov 15. That means the potential exists for very large reorganization of UASF-patched nodes (double spends, lost coinbase transactions, etc). Assuming, of course, that only a minority of hash rate continues to signal segwit through version bits. But this shouldn't be news and I can't imagine it's what Paul is referring to.

It's misleading because there is no such thing as a BIP-148 block. At best, there might be a BIP-148-compatible block.

Bitcoins are actually "saved" in the [block chain]( - a distributed ledger shared by every miner on the bitcoin network (or "full node").
What might be stored on a hard drive or online wallet are [private keys](
A private key gives you permission to spend coins associated with a particular address on the blockchain. Should anyone get ahold of your private key, they can spend coins at the address with or without your permission.
This is the basic principle behind [paper wallets]( in which your private key is stored on a piece of paper, and [brain wallets]( in which a passphrase used to generate your private key is stored in your head.

Aside from the cost, you really need to know what you're doing to make mining profitable. Here's a the graphical case against newcomers trying to get rich from mining: 
If you're interested in bitcoin, the best thing to do is buy a small amount with a particular goal. For example, send bitcoin to a friend who doesn't currently use it. Buy some hot-sauce online for bitcoin. Backup your wallet, then wipe it from your hard drive and restore it.
You'll learn quickly how things work, but you won't be risking much other than some time.
Edit: you can also learn a lot about bitcoin by setting up a [full node]( You won't make anything, but you'll gain insight.

The vulnerability seems to come from the way LN implements bidirectional payment channels. I'm still studying this, but here's what I make of it so far:
In a unidirectional channel (Alice-&gt;Bob), Alice gives value to Bob by signing a transaction that spends from a 2-of-2 multisignature output. Bob is motivated to discard previous transactions because Alice only sends updates that pay him more than previously. Bob closes the channel by signing and publishing the last transaction Alice sent him, maximizing the amount he collects.
Bob *could* close the channel by signing and publishing one of Alice's earlier transactions, but that's just throwing money away. Alice can't publish any of the intermediate transactions she sends to Bob because she doesn't have Bob's signature on any of them.
In other words, neither Alice nor Bob can cheat.
A bidirectional channel lets Alice pay Bob (Alice-&gt;Bob) *and* lets Bob pay Alice (Bob-&gt;Alice).
Now the channel balance of both parties can rise and fall as transactions are sent back and forth. Let's say Alice pays Bob, and Bob turns around and pays Alice the same amount.
Bob is now motivated to publish Alice's first transaction because that leaves him with more money. He would, in effect be stealing the difference from Alice. And Alice doesn't have much recourse.
So LN sets up a penalty system. If Bob tries to publish Alice's first transaction, she publishes another transaction ("breach remedy") that Bob signed which allows her to take all the money in the channel. This system uses time locks giving Alice time to publish her remedy before Bob steals the money.
If Alice's breach remedy lacks the fee needed for on-chain confirmation before the time lock expires, Bob can succeed in clawing back his payment to Alice.

Interesting - can you explain briefly how Worldcoin solves the micropayment fee problem?
@_date: 2013-12-28 01:01:44
I'm no expert, but I'll give it a try.
This problem is a special case of the more general [Byzantine Generals Problem]( one of the main problems solved by the Bitcoin block chain and protocol.
Two friendly generals need to coordinate an upcoming attack against a hostile enemy. Neither general currently knows when to begin the attack, and attacking alone is considered suicidal. The generals must agree on a specific time to start the attack. The only form of communication is via messengers who must be sent through hostile territory.
How can the two generals decide on an attack time given they can't be sure that the other will receive a message? This is the crux of the problem, which is much harder than it might seem at first glance.
To roughly translate this to Bitcoin: the generals are Bob and Alice. Instead of trying to agree when to attack an enemy, they must agree who has sent whom some money (BTC) and when. Bob and Alice must agree to the terms of this exchange based only on sending messages through an electronic medium assumed to be at least partially compromised (the Bitcoin network).
Edit: here's an even better explanation [by the man himself]( (thanks to 


try to rephrase it in that context.


King's wi-fi by brute forcing the password, which they've learned is a certain 
number of characters in length.  Once they stimulate the network to generate a 
packet, they must crack the password within a limited time to break in and 
erase the logs, otherwise they will be discovered and get in trouble.  They 
only have enough CPU power to crack it fast enough if a majority of them attack 
at the same time.


 It has been decided that anyone who feels like it will announce a time, and 
whatever time is heard first will be the official attack time.  The problem is 
that the network is not instantaneous, and if two generals announce different 
attack times at close to the same time, some may hear one first and others hear 
the other first.


receives whatever attack time he hears first, he sets his computer to solve an 
extremely difficult proof-of-work problem that includes the attack time in its 
hash.  The proof-of-work is so difficult, it's expected to take 10 minutes of 
them all working at once before one of them finds a solution.  Once one of the 
generals finds a proof-of-work, he broadcasts it to the network, and everyone 
changes their current proof-of-work computation to include that proof-of-work 
in the hash they're working on.  If anyone was working on a different attack 
time, they switch to this one, because its proof-of-work chain is now longer.


proofs-of-work.  Every general, just by verifying the difficulty of the 
proof-of-work chain, can estimate how much parallel CPU power per hour was 
expended on it and see that it must have required the majority of the computers 
to produce that much proof-of-work in the allotted time.  They had to all have 
seen it because the proof-of-work is proof that they worked on it.  If the CPU 
power exhibited by the proof-of-work chain is sufficient to crack the password, 
they can safely attack at the agreed time.


and global view problems you've asked about are solved.

The spread between BTC and $GBTC represents *something* - that's for sure. At the very least, it represents the premium that share investors place on being exposed to bitcoin price fluctuations. A positive spread suggests that share investors value this exposure positively. Unlike an ETF, $GBTC lacks a mechanism to peg the share price to the underlying exchange rate through trading bitcoin itself.
It was previously thought the spread might reflect the probability of Winklevoss ETF ($COIN) approval during the first round. The lower the spread, the higher the probability of $COIN approval. The idea being that anyone holding $GBTC would much rather hold $COIN due to its tighter coupling to the bitcoin exchange rate.
The EFT rejection has been appealed, and a new decision is pending. So maybe the spread has once again come to reflect the probability of $COIN approval. In other words, it ain't gonna happen. Maybe insiders know this.
Or maybe investment advisers are starting to see $GBTC as a way to juice returns or hedge given the overbought condition of stocks in general.
The weird thing is - there's really no upper limit to the spread AFAICT.

Nobody and everybody. This is by design.
No change can be made to Bitcoin without broad consensus among miners, the foundation, open source developers, exchanges, payment processors, and other participants.
Anybody can create their own Bitcoin clone (and they have been doing it with vigor lately). Some of these altcoins could easily step into Bitcoin's shoes in the future should any single party in the Bitcoin ecosystem start to throw its weight around.
It's is hard to understand because we've seen so few examples of such a large-scale and decentralized system before. This is why some are looking beyond Bitcoin-the-payment-system and starting to ask questions like: What other areas of society can be decentralized using the Bitcoin approach?

* It shows the product in isolation, making it that much more difficult for me to imagine what I'd use it for in a retail business.
* It mentions giving vouchers to customers, further confusing me because I thought this was to help me take money from my customers, not give it to them.
* It shows the terminal printing off paper receipt after paper receipt. As a merchant, I'm looking for ways to eliminate paper and so this doesn't look like something I need.
* It doesn't explain what my customer needs to have and/or do in order for me to take his/her payment.
* It does not clearly state whether my customer must have a Coinkite card or if they can use their own wallet app.

My point being that volatility hasn't killed Bitcoin yet. On the contrary, each new upleg generates that much more media attention and new users.
That June 2011 crash cut the exchange rate [by 90%]( What followed was a (relatively) long period of reduced interest during which a lot of the service we're now seeing were created.
If Bitcoin has a fatal vulnerability, sharp price swings are unlikely to be it.

Where does your dealership make most of its money?
If car loan originations contribute significantly to your dealership's bottom line, then this is going to be a really tough (impossible) sell for you.
I would forget about making any proposals until you understand the business you work for in detail. That will help you regardless of whether your boss goes along with the bitcoin idea.

It really depends on who you talk to.
One segment of the bitcoin community is trying to shift the basis of monetary power away from central banks and the current private banking system. This goes all the way back to Satoshi himself.
For this group, an economy fully running on Bitcoin (or something like it) is not out of the question.

Interesting. I'm not familiar with any of this.


How do you mean?

I would like to read anything more about your story you could reveal, maybe in a separate post so that others could share stories like this.

Fees look [pretty steep]( I imagine chargebacks are part of that.
