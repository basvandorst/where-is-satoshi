10k value for a digital check simply doesn't make sense; this market is not mature, or ready - the 2 main exchanges are down during any significant BTC rise or drop/once you can't sell, you can't sell at any price, while the Coinbase VP says institutional investors will bring liquidity to the market/I read the rich getting richer; make no mistake, the shorts are coming as soon as BTC options gets listed, and I will be one of them; simply because this is an electronic avoid-the-government scheme is not enough to me-I can send money NOW on Western Union anywhere in the world and pay less for instant NOW transactions. Care to argue- go ahead

Hey- I managed to get 7 (!) negative karma for 1 misguided post- let's see if you can top that.

Nice calc.  Paying off high interest debt is never a bad move, imo.

Thank you, for a decent reply.  Reading my own post again, I was mostly pissed at the lack of liquidity-but Omega One and others will hopefully resolve that.  BTW, I'm back in :)

You are looking at people buying into something they can relate to - vs. BTC, and XRP offers a low barrier of entry; would you rather buy 1000 XRP, or .07 BTC?  Plus, Brad they are controlling the supply of coins.  Long term, BTC will prove to be much more than it is now, IMO, but TODAY, XRP ruled.  ETH remains overpriced, btw, IMO.
