Wow, yeah, just went to Nasonex's website. I'm not a huge fan of side effects that are worse than the symptom (bleeding of the throat/lowered immune system).
I prefer mild discomfort in the form of hot peppers! haha.
Anyway, so long as you're using medicine as directed you can do whatever you want to your body. I'm glad you're well informed and I wish you a healthy, happy life.
Hey, could you do me a favor and message me with an explanation as to why bitcoins exploded in value? I thought they were controlled by tightening/loosening the encryption requirements for mining them. I had a chance to buy them when they were $20 a pop but I declined and now I'm really kicking myself in the ass.
It just seemed like a difficult thing to get into.

Hey just so you know, medication nasal spray will destroy your nasal membranes. It causes severe scarring. Please look into it and use something that doesn't cause scarring. There's a reason why they say not to use it for more than a day or two at a time. It's counter-productive.
I use sinus buster, but I'm not trying to promote a product so I won't go into it much except to say that it's all natural and uses capcaicin (hot pepper extract) to make your nose open up. It burns, but it's worth it to not have scars.

I followed cwenham here from the mod section (I'm also from CMV mods) and after reading this exchange I'm glad I voted to allow your comment chain to stick around. There was a lot of debate all around but my stance is that even if bitcoin bot allows for a cheap "Madison Avenue" sort of advertising scheme that's just part of the system. Name one product that doesn't have a gimmick designed to attract people.
Thanks again for your cooperation.
