No, right now it's only cash for bitcoin.

Great to hear! I look forward to the bitcoin economy spreading, the easier it is to get, the more incentive people merchants have to take it.

Yeah Robocoin was going to be too much expense and trouble.
We're using a more home-made option, built off of a nexus 7 and a bill exchanger. The app we're using is still under development, but we're giving feedback as we test it out.
That's one of the cool things about bitcoin, it's open, anyone can do what they want with it, as long as the blockchain supports it. It really empowers the little guy.

Fort Collins is great, I can't say I know much about the bitcoin side of the community, but the town as a whole is fantastic.
I hear what you're saying regarding bitcoin vending machines. Really, anyone with a coinbase account can get coin. We're looking to fill that (hopefully temporary) niche of people just getting into bitcoin that want to try it out. If they find it intuitive and easy (not there yet are we?), maybe they'll end up getting more coin and spending it. Which benefits merchants who accept it.

Yep, it's real, here's a radio story on it that aired this morning: 
I interviewed with her at the Alleycat, too bad we couldn't get her sorted on out making a purchase with BtC. Sounds like she finally got some through Coinbase though.
She was trying to figure it out on her iPhone, which made it difficult. If I call her back for a follow up interview, can she spend coin on a stock iPhone? I was under the impression she could move the use blockchain.info on her browser for that.

Sweet! What did you think of the experience? I'd like to change the interface up. Any feedback?

That's pretty much along the lines I was thinking. I would have thought that everybody (running the antivirus) would see the same false positive. The blockchain is identical for all of us right?

24 hours :)

Nope, not our style.

Good point, I never even thought about a client with scripting capability.

I've written a simple android POS that works adjacent to the android wallet (Andreas Schildbach's). Right now the process looks like 
1. customer scans a static QR code
1. inputs the amount possibly with a tip
1. shows the cashier the completed transaction on their phone
1. The cashier is supposed to listen for the wallet app to receive the coin, but I don't know if that's going to happen. 
I want to implement a request QR code, but this would prevent the customer from tipping the barrista in BtC. Any time you limit tipping possibilities, employees will complain, Since we're still implementing the system, the last thing I want is the users trying to sabotage it.
Speed-wise, it's not bad, but we haven't gotten any back to back bitcoin payments (yet!) 
The idea of a separate wallet for every transaction is intriguing. Other than tax/privacy benefits what other benefits would there be?

Looks good! Any particular package you used for the bitcoin checkout?
