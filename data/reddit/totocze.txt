You can get a ledger HW1 for 18€.
In any case, make a secure backup on a different medium.

int32 max value = 2 147 483 647  
1 btc = 100 000 000 satoshi  
21 * 100 000 000 = 2 100 000 000  
  
That in turns hints that whoever is Satoshi Nakamoto, that person was used to thinking in units of 32-bit computers as a Windows C++ programmer would be.

By checking what the mobile app displays to you.. (once they make it available)
1. create a transaction on a compromised pc, send it to the ledger wallet  
2. check it in the ledger mobile app (you'll get the tx details from their server that runs the wallet app)  
3. if it matches, sign it on the pc (probably with a one-time code from the mobile app, depends on how they implement that)
Something like this should be easily doable, it's the same as Trezor, except the screen is on your mobile device and it's not done offline.

GreenAddress + BTChip HW1 is my personal choice. Multisig is nice but with a hardware wallet it's even better, they also support Trezor.
There's early support for Coinkite in the BTChip too.

Yes, it's a different security model, and should be fine for 99% of cases IMO. Getting a phone compromised is way harder than just downloading some Windows keylogger. That's a targeted attack at that point and you're the weakest link anyway, not this security model.
  


I'm pretty sure there will be a backup option to make it sign a transaction without that code. Then you need a new wallet, no funds lost.
  


Did you check the Trezor firmware and bootloader yourself? Most people won't. It's the same thing.
(I'm not a ledger employee, just a BTChip HW.1 user.)

Addresses do not have spaces. Exchanger-bitcoin.com never sent any transaction to that address, so contact them/tell your friend to contact them. (And use more trustworthy services next time?)

Just a small correction, the post only provides the money transfer, WBTCB (a private company) is the real seller. Our Minister of Finance (a former communist agent) and Minister of Interior (a socialist, in charge of the post) are against bitcoin and will be investigating this situation :-(

tl;dr HSTS is a HTTP header that tells your browser to visit a certain site exclusively using an encrypted connection, with an expiration time. It reduces the risk of someone intercepting your connection (like the NSA router) to that particular website and giving you a fake webpage instead. The browser will refuse non-secure connections for however long the expiration time is set (180 days here), protecting you from SSL stripping and MITM attacks.  
  
It's not perfect, but it's better than nothing.  
(The perfect solution would perhaps involve DNSSEC DANE instead of standard TLS certs + authorities, but we're not there yet. Decentralized/Distributed DNS like Namecoin would be an improvement to security too.)

@_date: 2015-01-24 20:39:10
Exactly the same way bitcoin is better than banks, you don't have to trust the roots and TLD servers. As an addition it's cryptographically secure - only the authorized people with private keys can make changes to the system, not everyone who gains access to the DNS control panel at your registrar, etc. But you're probably right if we can rely on DNSSEC then it's reasonably secure already (but the content of the query is still not encrypted! also a small security risk)  
  
Edit: As a practical example, I remember 4chan got defaced via auth bypass on cloudflare.com (their DNS provider). This wouldn't have happened if Namecoin was fully deployed and they used a Trezor for security :-)

Did some googling and found this 
ECB's [Yves Mersch's]( talk on the topic.  
From a pure bitcoin perspective he's reinventing the wheel (just read the questions he asks – "Do we need one or more central infrastructures for instant payments in euro? Who will build, manage and operate them? Are links between infrastructures a possible way forward? " – all solved in BTC), but it's good that they're trying to improve the current system.  
The talk doesn't mention btc explicitly (it does mention just about every other new centralized payment provider) but i'm sure it was inspired by it.

They requested an exception to the treaty just for themselves and the Comission approved it, but it's not by default.  
I'm not sure but I think each exception has to be approved by all member states as well as it changes the common contract they all have signed.  
More details @   
  
I don't think the EU comission would want to force any state to adopt the Euro, but they have the right to do that and it's always a risk. Britain was clever and signed the Maastricht treaty with their opt-out already negotiated and included, changing it later is likely more problematic.  
This was included as part of the treaty:

SEPA has nothing to do with Euro being the official currency.  
  
It just depends if his bank participates or not. Many banks offer EUR accounts too, so currency conversion doesn't even need to happen if you have one.

I'd consider multisig + 2FA (greenaddress) or coinbase vault (the multisig version) as probably a little bit better options.  
Assuming you're not going to bother with paper wallets and you don't expect viruses to appear on that PC, you're fine, otherwise ^ for added security.
@_date: 2015-03-15 15:03:08
Actually every EU country will have to join the Euro system, there is currently no opt-out possible. EU commision decides on when that will happen, not the country.  
  
edit:  I forgot about the two individual opt-outs, but anyway, Croatians don't get to decide on their national currency ;-) Unless they'd like to leave the EU or fix their contract.

IIRC the addresses are ripemd160 hashes of the pubkey so discovering the public key is not possible before they're spent for the first time. this adds one more layer of security for those not reusing addreses. QC might break ECDSA, but it needs to break ripemd160 too.   
nobody really understands elliptic curves properly, so it's good to have that there. sha256 is better understood and considered safe for a long time and we'll know when to switch.  
NSA is however working on new quantum-resistant ciphers, so it seems they see it as a probable threat in a few decades from now.

it sucks, but there are two options when working with governments:  
a) comply with all of the government's arbitrary ideas.  
b) get fucked by the government.  
  
don't blame the companies, it's like taxation, there's no option b) (yet).

It's one of the "voluntary" "offers". You already have to be careful with uTorrent since it does the same for toolbars and other crap when you install it first. 
  
If you decline everything and change the settings a little, it can be run without ads and this other stuff and still remains a good torrent client.. That doesn't excuse shitty practices like this though.

I have both HW1 (old Ledger nano) and Trezor. It depends on the 2FA you want to use and if you prefer the default apps or something like Greenaddress..
Personally I find Trezor simpler to use (enter PIN to login + button to confirm + paper backup), but it's more expensive.
With ledger you need a security card or a smartphone at hand to spend bitcoins, since you don't have a display, so it's not that convenient to use. But they know what they're doing and their support is very good.
You could also use 2-of-3/3-of-3 with ledger.
So it really depends if you need a screen or not. (18€/34€ vs 99$)   
There are a few more differences, ie. Trezor is just a microcontroller and Ledger is a certified smartcard, but most of those don't make a huge difference in reality. Both are very good products.

This could theoretically be more anonymous than PGP emails and useful in certain cases.  
  
Remember Snowden and Lavabit? If this was deployed nobody would even know any such communication took place. It could also be used for other sensitive stuff, like espionage communications (as a number station replacement), since you can't track who's reading which part of the blockchain and distinguish them from normal bitcoiners.

Not sure what they mean by that, but it's kind of regulated already (there is an AML law). Both MoI's Analytical department and Ministry of Finance have released some reports, they're not silent about regulating btc. (The national bank doesn't look at it as a currency, so there's no oversight from them necessary.)
Better phrasing would be they consider the current regulation adequate, so there's no need to do anything (flawless logic, all gov'ts love conclusions like that :-)
