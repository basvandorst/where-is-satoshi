Totally cool! Just wanted to add onto your comment.

It‘s not about Bitcoin at all. And if Bitcoin crashes and burns it will change nothing. The underlying technology is what counts. And for that your statement is very true I think...

Well still it‘s a uniquely identifiable attribute so per definition not anonymous. 
The tracing of the origins of coins can be hardened through foggers, yes. But it‘s not anonymous.

Nothing imho. This won‘t change anything but add a way to enter the internet... It‘ll be still a us based ISP under US law as it‘ll remain a US company and it won‘t create anything „new“ per se...

Well it can, but who would get that money. Manufacturing businesses already do get paid for machine time. The higher the degree of automation, the higher the percentage of income through „machine time“. 
But the worth of money depends on the wether you and me can use it to consume. If consumption halts, the income from machine time halts... 
What he could mean by that is that money is only worth something as a mean of abstracted exchange between producer and consumer. You get money for something to exchange it into goods. As long as everyone owns enough to consume, this cycle works. However ongoing automation will reduce the need for human work thus reducing the available income. 
If people have less money to consume, products will either be useless to the many or will have to get cheaper, thus decrease in value. 
More automation → Less human work → Less disposable income → less consume → Lower value of goods (thus your money is worth „less“ as you can‘t exchange it for as much as before)

That thing about hindsight is oh so true... 
My dad studied cs back in the early 90s and he once told me about how it would have been easily for him and his colleagues to just get themselves about every other domain they wanted. Like back then it was nothing of worth and they just never saw it coming I guess... 
When you check for the most expensive domains it’s about the same feeling I guess... 
EDIT: got the years wrong...

Escrow is a strange name for a 20something, innit?

Title on the cover doesn’t match the title of the book. Not trying to be a douche just wanted to tell you shouldn‘t you have noticed!
