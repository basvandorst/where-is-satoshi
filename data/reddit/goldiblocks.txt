I can't agree. I am a mum with a family and I pay my taxes and do everything legit in my life. I just don't want my financial future ruined by dodgy KYC that puts my personal data into the hands of hackers which will ultimately ruin my financial future. KYC absolutely does not equal security or legal activity. This is the gov line being pushed. 
@_date: 2019-03-29 11:29:59
Paxful is absolutely KYC. You can't even put an ad up without being hit up for your info. If that's not KYC then I don't know what is! :)

Yeah it's called LocalCoinSwap - [ :D
@_date: 2019-03-29 08:21:49
So start trading [LocalCoinSwap]( optional KYC and 23+ cryptocurrencies to trade. :D Plus they give 100% of their profit back to the crypto community. They are the real deal. Top P2P traders themselves with the best interest of the community at heart

A bit more about LocalCoinSwap
**LocalCoinSwap** \- [
They are the world's first community-owned P2P exchange. That means that the community are invested in voting and creating a platform that is lucrative for P2P traders AND the business as they receive dividends from the platform.
LocalCoinSwap Features:
* You can buy, sell and trade Bitcoin plus 23 other cryptocurrencies such as Monero, Dash, Ethereum, Tether, Dai, Litecoin etc
* **It is NO KYC or OPTIONAL KYC.** This means that you can choose to trade in the way that you prefer.
* Over 250+ payment methods
* Over 160+ fiat currencies
* Available in over 190+ countries worldwide
* Lucrative referral program
* Huge Market Maker discounts
* No withdrawal or deposit limits
* They give **100%** of their profit back to the crypto community.
The best thing is that when they give the profit back to the community, they don't use a dodgy token, they give the profit back in the cryptocurrency traded on the P2P exchange. So, for instance, if Bitcoin is traded on the exchange, the community receive Bitcoin. If Monero is traded on the platform, the community receives Monero. This means that you get a diverse portfolio of cryptocurrencies just by holding their platform token every quarter.

Although being an optional feature increases accessibility to cryptoocurrency for people who cannot access and provides a platform for people who prefer anonymity. P2P platforms like [LocalCoinSwap]( give users local trades and anonymity if they prefer.

That's why there is [LocalCoinSwap](
@_date: 2019-03-29 11:28:02
Yep, LocalCoinSwap is no KYC. :D
@_date: 2019-03-29 11:28:59
LocalCoinSwap has 23+ cryptocurrencies - Bitcoin, Dash, Monero, Ethereum, Dai, Tether, Litecoin to name a few. :D
@_date: 2019-03-29 08:17:29
Paxful are initiating KYC also. They are based in EU so they fall under the same EU regulations.
[LocalCoinSwap]( is the best answer - It is optional KYC so a trader can decide for themselves if they want to use KYC or not. They are also all P2P traders themselves. LocalCoinSwap are the only platfrom in the world to give 100% of the profit back to the crypto community and they are a genuinely top team of cryp enthusiasts who want to develop a ground breaking P2P platform.  
Why would anyone trade with any of the P2P monopolies when they can choose to P2P trade on a platform that gives 100% of the profit back to the crypto community?
@_date: 2019-03-29 11:23:47
I also can't agree with you. Any site that I have used KYC likely means that my data is now in dark web territory. Reputation is what matters on P2P platforms. Understanding who you are trading with and having choice to choose who you trade with. 
KYC also means less accessibility to people in geographical locations who do not have access to the necessary identification documentation.

**LocalCoinSwap** is the answer - [
* They offer optional KYC
* Buy, sell and trade peer-to-peer Bitcoin + 23 more crytpocurrencies
* 250+ payment methods
* 160+ fiat currencies
* Available in 190+ countries worldwide
* No withdrawal or deposit limits
* A lucrative referral program
* Market maker discounts
* They also give 100% of their profit back to the crypto community.
The profits are distributed in the crypto traded on the exchange, so if Bitcoin is traded, the community holding their native token (LCS Cryptoshares) receive Bitcoin. If Dash is traded, the community receive Dash. It's an awesome incentive for projects to partner with this team as they have been seeing since launch.
It means that you can profit as a P2P trader on the spread, anonymously if you prefer, AND by holding their LCS Cryptoshares token, you can also profit from the 100% profits going to the community.

He has deleted the comment now and trying to play it off as a "what if" question. Shows how he only cares about profits for himself. His PR team will be in overdrive and probably forced him to delete the tweets.

Actually, there are many benefits for people worldwide to use NO KYC platforms. My family in Brazil don't have access to enough identification to suffice KYC on centralized exchanges. Users in India have their bank accounts shut down by the state-run banking monopoly if they link their bank account to a centralized exchange, even just to withdraw their funds; Some countries block centralized exchanges altogether. Not to mention, many people prefer to trade privately knowing that most platforms that take our KYC data aren't completely secured and most KYC data from crypto platforms has ended up on the dark web.   
To laugh at the financial access that non-kyc platforms offer people worldwide, is to ignore the financial opportunities that cryptocurrency provides to fair, legal and honest people who have as much a right as anyone else in first world countries to be able to access financial security.

@_date: 2019-06-28 10:54:49
Yes, that's correct. When you buy or sell on LocalCoinSwap there is a progress bar that takes both buyer and seller through the steps to buy and sell their crypto. Once you initiate the contract to buy the seller will be requested to fund the escrow and during this process there are clear messages advising the buyer that the seller is funding their escrow. 
  
I hope this helps. I can grab some screenshots for you and post tomorrow if that helps.  [��](

No, paxful are in Estonia. They have people in New York but their business office is in Europe which is why they are held to EU laws. They wouldn't have been able to do no kyc previously out of the U.S. They use New York in social media and videos more often as it sounds more legitimate.
@_date: 2019-04-02 01:06:08
Yes! They soft launched around Oct last year and hard launched at the start of March this year. They are a great team that really care about the experience of P2P traders and P2P finance in general.

And to register to use their site.
@_date: 2019-04-02 10:29:45
Hey lapen, the reason there are few traders is because we have only just hard launched a month ago. Brand awareness and Network effects take time. We are working on a comprehensive program to increase liquidity as we speak. You even have some really great opportunities to join our P2P  market maker program if you trade more than 10 BTC oye 25BTC per month. 
The best part of all this is that, as LocalCoinSwap give 100% of the profit back to the crypto community, increasing liquidity means profits into the hands of people, not corporations like is the case for ALL other P2P platforms. 
The two founders were LBC traders for many years, they have a lot of respect for LBC but they are building a platform built by traders, designed for traders and one that profits traders. The rest of us are P2P traders also but not on the scale of the glosses, but we all day P2P trade in our respective countries.
There are 4000+ investors who own LCS cryptoshares, the platforms unique dividend token. We chat all day everyday in the LocalCoinSwap telegram channel. 
There is no scam unless it involves me working 14 hours a day, everyday on marketing, video production, social media, mastering partnerships, events etc; devs working around the clock on improving transactions, implementing new tokens, developing new features, creating API documentation; customer service creating new SLA's to improve P2P customer service which is historically terrible on most other platforms; Community managers working 7 days a week to educate and help investors and traders benefit from a strong community.
I'm so glad you joined up to the site. If you have time, come and join us in telegram and let us know your thoughts about what makes the best platform and chat with me/us more to alleviate any concerns. I'm certain you will soon see what I'm describing above within our community. :)

Or [LocalCoinSwap](  \- they are no KYC and they give 100% of the profit from the exchange back to the crypto community.
@_date: 2019-04-02 00:59:45
A little too good to be true is a strange statement to make considering all the platforms you are suggesting people should use used to have "no KYC" until their local country regulations changed that. LocalCoinSwap deal with dishonest users and chargebacks the exact same way that KYC platforms deal with them. Don't forget that just because there is KYC on a platform, doesn't mean that a user can no longer do a chargeback. There is no correlation. Also, what makes you think that dishonest users can't get their hands on KYC information on the dark web? There is more KYC data and photographs with photoshopped dates than ever before due to the enormous number of dishonest centralized exchange hacks. Let's go through a few assumptions you are making...
Firstly, KYC doesn't make a trade safe. Reputation makes a trade safe as well, different payment methods have different levels of risk. With all P2P platforms you need to know the risks of each payment type. Some payment types are more tisky than others such as Paypal, which I woulnd't EVER do personally unless I knew the trader. It has nothing to do with KYC.
Secondly, let's remember that these other platforms like LBC and Paxul haven't implemented KYC for security reasons or because they care about their users. Anyone who believes that is more more gullible than they realise. These platforms have implemented KYC because they are being forced to by their overseeing regulator in their respective countries...They don't care about your security more than it affects the amount of profit they make at the end of the day.
1/ LocalCoinSwap has secure escrow protection in the platform which protects users whilst trading. If you have any issues with a trader then you open a dispute and your trade is reviewed by a customer service representative. There is no difference in this than with any other P2P platform. 
2/ LocalCoinSwap also keep 95% of their funds in cold storage for further platform safety. 
3/ You can choose the reputation level of users whom you want to trade with when posting a trade. 
4/ Reputation ratings - Just like ebay, you can provide feedback to help others ascertain the level of risk that they are willing to take with another P2P trader. You can also set users to be more trustworthy than others. 
The reality is that the concept that KYC makes your trades safer is flawed, and one that is being promoted by the P2P platforms that are being forced to implement KYC due to the fact that they are being hit with regulation in Europe. If they weren't being hit with this EU regulation, LBC and Paxful etc would still be saying that KYC is unnecessary and less secure. It's important that as a crypto community, we keep an eye out for the false news spread by LBC and Paxful and understand what is in it for them to spread the rumours. 
In addition, I wouldn't be surprised if all of our KYC data is available on the dark web in some format or another due to hacks from centralized exchanges. Don't forget, once your KYC data is lost and taken and you get a red mark against your financial record, it is almost IMPOSSIBLE to come back from that. I don't take the chance, personally. 
Optional KYC lets you choose how much information you want to know about a trader in order to conduct a trade. If you want to get KYC data from a user, then all you have to do is specify it in the terms and conditions of trade. If you don't want KYC data, then you just specify that in your terms of trade also. 
Regarding the team, I can also say that the LocalCoinSwap project are one of the most transparent teams you will find in crypto. They have monthly AMA's with the founders where they respond live to questions from the community in Telegram. They have helpful community managers. They are also one of the only P2P platforms with a live and active Telegram AND discord channel where you can chat directly with the team. The only other I can think of is LocalEthereum. 
Don't forget that LocalCoinSwap also give 100% of the profit from the exchange back to the crypto community. The team are actual P2P traders (unlike most of the people working for P2P platforms out there currently) and so they have empathy and understanding for the experiences that P2P tradesr have. They explicitly believe that profit should be in the hands of the people, not them and so they give the profit back to the community.

Or they could just move it into a stable coin to hedge volatility. Projects like Localcoinswap facilitate this for peer to peer transactions
