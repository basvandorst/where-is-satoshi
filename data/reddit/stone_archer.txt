Yep, I noticed that too. It was basically ignored in the analysis and notes.

Perhaps, but if you use the jason davies wordcloud tool you can manually choose how it's angled.

Yes, you can align the words to angles in the picture using the 'rotate' function in a graphic editing tool, whether it be inkscape, GIMP, illustrator, photoshop etc. and overlay those angles with a straight guide line as was done here.

Our work so far...
Edit: Numbers in inner circle are colored to make them stand out, circles and ellipses of different colors around mnemonic words corresponding to numbers are also shown. Words that are gray or orange are not mnemonic.

Latest work on the graphic if it's helpful:
When this graphic was made, the settings for the rendition of angles for all words resulted in total of 5 distinct angles all the words sit on.
The attached shows guides inside the circle for each of the five angles set in the graphic, and bip39 words circled in corresponding color of each guide \(line\).
Colors of red, orange, yellow, green and blue are set to rotations of \-60, \-30, 0, \+30 and \+60 degrees respectively.
The reason only small words are circled: all clues containing mnemonic words refer to the small words, and they are more manipulatable than the larger words if by chance, however likely or not, they are moved.
Number of words for each color guide is shown in legend, bottom right of graphic.
Miscellaneous notes:
\*\*Discovered that the word 'main' just above 'split' belongs to green group, so green has total of 6 words instead of 5.
Total of words in all color groups is 38.
Total of 25 small words outside of circle.
Words that hang partially outside the logo's circle were not counted in legend or in the total of 25 outside circle.
unalig \(purple\) = 'unaligned', which likely can be disregarded. A small number of words appear to not align with any of the 5 angles but on closer examination this doesn't appear to be the case.
Maybe coincidence, but one word for each color group evenly \(or nearly evenly\) dissects the circle.

But if somehow these angles do matter in the scheme of words, and a pattern can be applied from the clues, etc., let's just say you add 'process' to the yellow group; 
Adding 'process' may also imply that ANY small words partly inside the circle should also now be added to their respective groups:
'add' \(green\), total for green group now 7
'modify'; 'casual' \(blue\), total for blue group now 9
'want' \(orange\), total for orange group now 6
Not sure what any of this means btw, just playing with patterns, angles... maybe it correlates, maybe not. :o\)
