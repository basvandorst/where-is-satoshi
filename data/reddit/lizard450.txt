Yeah the entire appeal of Bitcoin is that it's backed by the users and not the government.  I can't imagine a major government backing a currency they mathematically don't control.  
Bitcoin (and other platforms) will continue to grow and it will be used more and more as both a store of value and means of value transfer.  I don't see it growing to replace fiat any time soon.

[Not quite](
Here is a better explanation in my opinion.
Problems I have with PoS.
Andreas mentions them.  
1.  It's centralizing the consensus protocol by design.  The rich get richer etc. etc. 
2.  Paraphrasing here because Andreas explains it so well "By cheating in the system you might lose those coins, but it's possible to make gains in other ways outside of the system"
For example if you were to spend a fair amount of money to disrupt the PoS based coin it could create some FUD and you can short the market.  One way to do this would be to spam the network with transactions and only process your transactions.  With this type of attack you'd be gaining the mining reward and causing fud from which you could open a short and make gains that way.  
If PoS is attacked I'm not really aware of any really good exit strategies. 
3.  It's not as immutable as PoW is. 
The major complaints with PoW are as follows.
1. Energy Consumption.
2. Centralization of mining we're seeing with the development of ASICs
So some pros for PoS are it uses less energy and it is faster.
Some pros for PoW are it's more reliable, immutable, and defensible against attacks.  
For example you can spam attack a PoW system, but you're losing money in the system.  We do need to get rid of the essential monopoly on building ASIC miners.  We can change the algorithm if we need to so that's a helpful option to have as well.  
I was thinking of a potential solution.  It would be a combination of PoS and PoW ..  I know they have those, but I haven't seen a white paper explain it like this.
Basically you'd have 2 blockchains.  One maintains who is authorized to mine on the block.  Basically you'd mine to get your account in the block to be able to mine.  When you do this you put up any amount of coins you want as your Stake... The amount you put up is correlated to how much you can get in the mining reward up to a max of the mining reward.  So if there is a mining reward of 50 ATC you put in 100 as your stake and you'd only get 50 ATC, but if you try and cheat the system you lose your 100 ATC etc.   You receive no reward simply for getting your name on the list.  The miner here that writes the block would include miners in the block and the order they are in the block is their "number" so to speak.  
The 2nd chain would be the currency chain.  The "miner" that would write the block here would be determined by the most recent hash of the mining block plus the most recent hash of the currency block moded by the number of possible miners in the mining block that are available.   The miner selected would be the number they joined the block.  Once you are selected you're no longer considered part of the mining block.  If you publish a block you get the reward and fees, but if the mining block publishes a new block before you do then you open yourself up to the possibility of missing your chance.  In order to write the new block you'd also have to do some PoW that would be relatively trivial to provide the thermodynamically provable use of time.
Anyway there are some other variables that can be tweaked here and there.  There would be blocksize limits that would be relatively small.  Particularly with the mining blockchain.
Some advantages here that I see is that it would dramatically reduce the economic incentive of spending more energy.  I could see some benefits in gaining hashing power to try to control the mining network.  Pools could form to combat this practice.  I think it would also help keep the barriers to entry lower and more distributed in participating as an authority figure on the network. 
Of course I'm only one person ... who knows what kinds of attacks such a system might be susceptible too.

Well bitcoin has had actually free transactions in the past.  The result was someone spamming the blockchain.  Blocks are scarce resources and the community here would like to keep it scares as it promotes the decentralization of power of the bitcoin protocol.  
The good news is Bitcoin recently released a new technology that does allow for no-low fee transactions from happening.  I is bleeding edge technology, but as the lightning network is rolled out I can see new technologies being built on it that might pave the way for some business models that are possibly more appealing to you. 
For example I can imagine in a few years having an Uber like service that runs on LN and the participants of the service could be something like drivers, passengers, and maybe auditors.  There would be no need for middle men to control payment and therefore no one to take to court.  
It's pretty cool.  Hope you stick around and learn more.  Things are about to get pretty exciting in the next few years.  This is one of those special times in history like 1992 right before the internet really started to catch on.  
@_date: 2018-01-10 22:14:41
The short answer is the LN network doesn't really need to worry about spam. 
Spam is a problem for the blockchain because its a shared scarce resource.   You have a bunch of computers that store this information in an immutable datastore.  The reason for that is because miners that write to the blockchain have done so many computations to write to the blockchain that it is infeasible to overwrite it.  
With the LN there is no blockchain involvement outside of opening and closing the channels.  If you were to do what you suggest and send 1000 tx back and forth between 3 nodes.  
1.  Only the nodes involved are really affected.  As compared to affecting the entire bitcoin infrastructure immediately and in the future.   
2.  The resources involved in the transactions are really just bandwidth and processor power and it is an infinitesimally small amount compared to the main bitcoin network where bandwidth and hard disk space are used now more forever and lets not forget negatively affecting user experience.
3.  If the middle node wants to shut down the channel they are free to do so at anytime.
4.  All the two outer nodes would essentially be doing is dumping money into the center node in small transaction fees.

@_date: 2018-01-10 19:42:28
Only the transactions to open and close channels are done.  I don't think there is really a limit to how many transactions could be done while the channel is open.  
While the LN gets more and more nodes then paying on it will become more convenient and less costly with more privacy.  I could pay you through a channel that I have with zongk if you and zongk also had a channel... or through n number of nodes etc.  Kind of like how packets are passed through the internet. 
Since the transactions are off chain they are more private.  I believe that they are working on really making the transactions completely private but i'm not sure.  did I get it right?
@_date: 2018-01-11 21:04:33
Bitcoin does offer smart contracts, but their support for them is limited.  They are rolling out an improvement to their smart contract support with MAST.  
Can you tell me why you believe smart contracts on a blockchain technology is important?  The inability of them to interact with external resources really limits their usefulness in real life applications IMHO, but maybe my imagination is limited.  I'm very excited for applications to be built on the lightning network.. I can see a future where an autonomous corporation like uber runs on top of the lightning network and that really excites me.

Yes, as a community it is important to support new mining operations.  What we have seen is that bitmain has consistently been able to produce top tier miners and therefore make it difficult for other competitors to compete.  
Another avenue I could see is trying to compete on a ghs/watt basis but on a smaller scale .. So a 1TH miner with approximately 120-150 watts.  
The other big problem with new miner producers is established credibility.  Why should we trust Halong mining?

I'd really encourage you to look into the details about BTC vs bcash.
The fact of the matter is this.  Any new tech is going to have some growing pains and Bitcoin just went through one.  
The reality of the matter is bcash can't scale.  At least not without becoming centralized.  What I mean here is that really only people with a lot of money and access to a lot of bandwidth would be able to run nodes.  Hard disk space is also an issue as well.  
We want full archival nodes on the network.  
In a lot of ways bcash has really helped Bitcoin IMHO.  I feel that a lot of people came out of hiding and really investigated the issue and got caught up on the past few years of Bitcoin.  Myself included.  
We learned that a contentious hardfork isn't so bad and so long as we remain true to the principles underlying Bitcoin we will continue to make progress have have success.  
Personally I have learned some deeply important technical aspects and how they relate to those core principles.  The people who believe in these principles must remain vigilant and protect Bitcoin because it will always be under attacks.  Some new .. some old.  
What concerns me about bcash mostly is this.  Segwit was a great compromise.  It was a malleability fix and a blocksize increase (to a maximum of 4MB).  Bcash has an absolute stance on the matter and doesn't really respect the very valid concerns surrounding increased blocksizes.
After looking into the situation I realize why this sub is heavily moderated.  I believe that someone is actually paying people to shill over at the other sub.  It basically got to the point where the developers had to stop debating this bullshit topic and get back to coding.  They aren't professional public speakers they are developers.
  
@_date: 2018-01-30 02:42:48
segwit adoption is up to over 18% ... If you look at the usage numbers they are the same as they were prefork.  There was a lot of extra transactions of course with people claiming fork money.  Also it's suspected that there were some coordinated attacks.  
Now we have lightning and people are really happy with it so far.

@_date: 2018-01-08 16:18:22
I'd actually respond to your argument if it was at all relevant to the topic in the thread.  We're not talking about the merits of BTC vs BCH we're talking about PoW vs PoS and my position on PoS is that it's not viable because in addition to leading to centralization by increasing the barrier to entry of participation of being an authority participant in the network .. the trust is then put into the stake holders and while in an isolated bubble this makes sense why would someone devalue something they have so much stake in.. the problem comes into play when one can profit from devaluing an asset they have significant amounts of stake in.   
I used BCH as one such example where a stakeholder is profiting from introducing FUD into the market.  
However since you seem to REALLY want to get into it.  Fine.  It's been proven that BTC and crypto in general cannot function w/o centralization by increasing blocksize.  So while Core understands this and has opted for a more measured increase of the blocksize to 4mb with segwit and offchain solutions as well as additional effective increases .. BCH does not.  BTC actually has the transactions to merit filling blocks where BCH does not and therefore comparing the two is apples to oranges.  
Also a nice point of note... Core has compromised .. where as BCH's only scaling solution is to increase the blocksize ... then I've heard some shills talking about introducing PoS into BCH so it's really a pathetic joke.

This is tricky.  Bitcoin the protocol/currency is by far the most secure.  It has the most proven consensus algorithm PoW and it has the most hashing power behind it.
As for your coins being safe bitcoin is supported by every credible wallet and therefore the bitcoin community has access to the best ways to store their BTC.  That being said it's also attacked the most by various methods.  
So if you're new the best/easiest route is to go with a trezor or a ledger hardware wallet and practice good security practices.  


What do you mean?  It is competing with fiat currency and has been for many years. 




I'll answer these two together.   Bitcoin was founded upon the principle that no single person controls bitcoin.  No company no country.  The appeal here is that there isn't a single point to attack bitcoin to "make it go away".  Paypal for example could be shut down and that's the end of paypal.  Not true with Bitcoin.  
This really empowers the individuals participating in Bitcoin.  The problem here is that now to make changes to the protocol you need a level of community support.  
Now bitcoin is based on blockchain technology and one of the weaknesses of blockchain technology is the ability to scale.  Since Bitcoin is being ran on more than 10000 computers around the world called nodes and each node has an entire copy of the blockchain this means these 10,000+ computers need to have the resources to support Bitcoin ... bandwidth and hard disk space.  So Bitcoin had a 1MB blocksize limit and still does for legacy addresses.  This is so that nodes can be ran by many people keeping the decentralized nature of Bitcoin which it was founded upon intact.  Basically Bitcoin wants a low barrier to entry for running a node (and ideally mining, but we're hoping that the market will sort this out in the next year or two) 
So with a 1 MB block, and a block being executed about every 10 minutes means that the Bitcoin network can only process about 7 transactions a second... which is nothing compared to it's current usage and where we want Bitcoin to be.  
One solution to improve the transaction scaling issue is to increase the blocksize and allow for more transactions.  This would have a linear improvement on Bitcoin's ability to accept more transactions, but at the cost of linearly increasing the burden on the nodes resources of bandwidth and hard disk space which would mean less nodes running and by extension hurting the strength of the bitcoin network.
BCH believes that Bitcoin can scale just fine by simply increasing the blocksize.  Bitcoin Core (the lead developers of Bitcoin) disagrees because if you look at Bitcoin's adoption rate compared to the improvements in technology we see that Bitcoin would easily outpace the ability for a common person to be able to run a node.  BCH doesn't believe this is an issue and believes that only major operations should be running full nodes because only miners can write to the blockchain.  Bitcoin core disagrees with this because non-mining nodes do have a say in changes to the blockchain by accepting them or rejecting them.  So if a miner wanted to make a change to the blockchain that didn't conform to the Bitcoin protocol nodes could reject the block and the miner wouldn't get the reward or transaction fees.  Nodes can also make changes to the protocol via a UASF or user activated soft fork.  
Finally bitcoin is just as fast as it ever was if you pay the appropriate fee which is expensive.   If you pay a low fee bitcoin can be very slow and frustrating to use.  I don't think one can say Bitcoin is outdated because currently it has the most usage and is the only cyprto currency that is seeing the type of usage that would result in scaling issues.  Every competitor to Bitcoin be it LTC, XMR, or BCH would be experiencing the same scaling issues bitcoin is dealing with right now provided we placed the same load on their networks.  Realistically XMR would see scaling issues with far less load than Bitcoin is dealing with now.  LTC would be about the same as Bitcoin, and BCH would have more transaction issues with fewer nodes.  ETH is also seeing scaling issues as we speak.
Bitcoin is working on it.  They have implemented Segwit which effectively makes the maximum block size 4MB and the average blocksize about 2MB.  So Bitcoin Core has compromised a bit on increasing the block size and they are implementing another improvement that will effectively make the block size 5 MB, but I can't recall the name of it at the moment.  The most notable and exciting improvement is the newly release lightning network which allows users to make instant transactions off chain (outside of the blockchain) for very low or no fee at all.  
Privacy is another issue that Bitcoin might be labeled as "outdated on" XMR has established itself as an excellent privacy coin, but there are other compromises that have been made in monero (XMR).  The lightning network is a good step towards improving privacy, but we'll have to wait until the lightning network is more adopted for us to see the benefits in day to day transactions. 


Bitcoin has the strongest network and longest history.  It has paved the way to where crypto is today and it has endured and conquered the most attacks.  Really I can't think of any other crypto currency that is attacked really.  
Bitcoin's development community is amazing.  Many of the notable developers who work on Bitcoin directly and indirectly (such as making alternative wallets for example) also contribute and support other projects like XMR.  For example electrum is a very popular wallet that is copied for many other alt coins .. including bitcoin cash and litecoin.
Bitcoin cash developers continue to integrate many changes that Bitcoin Core has contributed to Bitcoin so I think that speaks volumes to the development community surrounding Bitcoin. 
The Electrum developers really demonstrated their professionalism recently when a critical bug (which personally I don't think was all that critical) was discovered and fixed extremely promptly.  I was really impressed and it's evidence that they employ good development practices like continuous integration in order to be able to respond so quickly.  I really only worked at one company that really had a good continuous integration setup.

The price is nice and everything, but really you need to understand exactly what Bitcoin is. From a technical level, from a political level, and from an economic level.
Look at what they are doing?  No one owns this shit it's organic.  The lightning network blows my mind.  Look at all the products and services built around Bitcoin this currency that exists only on the internet owned by no one.  You can take part in it by running a node or mining.  Maybe even developing for it.   
Bitcoin is incredible.  The attacks made upon bitcoin are pretty intense and they mean nothing to it.  It's rather incredible
@_date: 2018-01-26 22:36:11
First lets go over what Bitcoin is.  Bitcoin is a protocol that manages a ledger called the blockchain and it's also the name of the currency.
So what is the ledger called the blockchain?  Basically it's just a list of transactions "debit this account and credit this account" 
An account in this instance would be a public key.  When you create a bitcoin wallet or address you create a private key and the corresponding public key.  When someone sends bitcoin to your public key address a miner will pick up that transaction and include it in a block.  Then your address has Bitcoin.  You can sign a transaction with your private key and broadcast it to the network and send your bitcoin anywhere you want. 
Bitcoin (the currency units) are created through a process called mining.  When a miner mines a block they get to assign a block reward to any address they want.  
When you're talking about a physical wallet/paper wallet you're typically talking about a piece of paper that has the public and private key printed out onto it.  What is nice about a paper wallet is that paper can't be hacked.  Over the years however the community has developed better ways to manage your wallets.
Today we use seeds to help generate our wallets.  It's a list of words 12-24 and this is what you want to write down.  Ideally you'd write it down in a fireproof method.  Such as stamping it to steel or using a product called cryptosteel.  Your seed can generate your wallet addresses again and again so if your wallet is destroyed you can restore it with your seed. 
When you create a wallet with either a trezor, ledger nano s, or something like Electrum it will give you a seed when you start and then bring you to all of your addresses.

First step is you want to make sure your bitcoin is secure. You need to employ the proper security measures to be successful.
Claim and transfer only one coin(fork) at a time to an exchange. When you do bcash ONLY do bcash etc. This is important. A lot of people mess this up and send bcash to a bgold address on the exchange and what not and that’s it your money is gone. It will be way worse than pulling teeth to get those coins from the exchange support if you can get them at all.
Move your Bitcoin out of their old public addresses preferably into a new bech32 segwit address. Electrum is a good wallet to do this with. I recommend doing this offline if you can. Make sure you have their latest as they just had a critical security release, IMHO it wasn’t a big deal your wallets should always be encrypted anyway. Regardless of your wallet preferences please make sure to back up your seeds in a fireproof method such as cryptosteel or simply a punch set or dremel into steel.
Now you’ll want to make a binance account, maybe a kucoin account, gate.io, and bit-z … This way as you claim your coins you can transfer them into a useful coin like Bitcoin or Litecoin and move them to a secure address. Right now since we’re in a transition period I recommend using LTC for faster cheaper transfers and it’s a good coin. I think long term LTC following in the foot steps of BTC with the lightning network will serve to be useful.
On your android device you’ll need 3 apps. Coinomi (write down the seeds and passwords as you would with any other long term wallet don’t treat this any differently, but maybe you don’t need to put it into steel), Bitpie, and bither. In your bitcoin wallet electrum with the wallet of your old private key you’ll want to hit view&gt;addresses and then in the addresses tab pull up the QR code for your private key that you transferred your BTC out of in step 1. Then in Coinomi you’ll want to get your bcash and bitcoin gold by scanning that private key into a bcash (bitcoin cash) and bitcoin gold wallet respectively. Then you can send that over to Binance.
To claim your bitcoin diamond and super bitcoin you’ll need bitpie and bither. Make sure you write down the seeds and passwords. They are important. You open bither. go to settings up top right with the gear then click “advanced options” Then you want to select “import private key” and “From Private key text” . Then you hit the camera and scan the same QR code you did for coinami (the QR code of your old private key that you transferred out of in step 1) .
Then with bitpie you need to make a wallet for bitcoin super and diamond. Screenshot the wallet address and what I ended up doing is uploading it to google drive pulling it up on my computer then going back into bither then sending my super bitcoin and such to the address I created in bitpie that I pulled up from google drive on my computer.
Then I sent the bcash to binance along with the bitcoin gold, I sent the super bitcoin and diamond to gate.io and the bitcore to bit-z … Bitcore isn’t really going to be worth it unless you have like 10 bitcoin or so it will get you like .5 LTC
But yeah… if you have 10 bitcoin or so you probably have about $30,000 USD worth of forked alt coins out there you can claim and put back into BTC. Enjoy.
Since segwit bech32 is still new not every exchange is going to support it yet. I recommend moving your long term BTC holdings into a bech32 address and your fork holdings converting that into litecoin and holding it there.

So the seed is a set of 12-24 words that will create set of addresses for you.  
The trezor provides a very secure method of creating an HD wallet (wallet based on seed) which points to multiple coins.  
I am not aware of any software (there probably is something, but I don't think they have the same type of reputation that Trezor has) that provides that type of functionality for the 4 coins you mentioned.
The issue here is if you want to be safe then when you use the software version.  It should be done on a computer that is secure and never connects to the internet after your seed is generated.  
In my opinion getting a Trezor is the easiest, fastest, and most secure way to go.  You can also go with a Ledger Nano S.  It's also an excellent product with a great reputation.  You'd have to wait until they become available again I think it is in March.. so this is why I am recommending the Trezor.   
Also don't forget seriously get a fireproof method of securing the seed.  [here]( . getting one or two of these is well worth it.

It makes sense.  Bcash is a way of centralizing bitcoin.  After it becomes more centralized then it's easy to control.  
It's interesting that they are playing their hand so early.  They must of been scared by the growth.
@_date: 2018-01-27 03:03:13
This is probably the best thing to do.  Then you just need to back up the seed from your new wallet.  
If you don't want to move the funds Electrum has an option to import private keys into a wallet, but I really do recommend the seed generated wallets.

I think you should go over the bitcoin white paper You can listen to it [here]( . or if you prefer reading [here](


Technically yes, but whether or not the community accepts your code is a different matter all together.  If you really feel very strongly about the way bitcoin should go then you might be stuck sitting on your hands for a long time or venturing out into your own fork. 


Bitcoin is a number of things and it's a bit confusing.  Bitcoin is both a protocol and the unit of value.  The units of value are really just numbers on a ledger (the blockchain) associated with addresses.  The protocol aspect of it is ran by bitcoin applications full nodes and miners.  These bitcoin applications can have different implementations.  Like HTTP is a protocol and google chrome and firefox have different implementations.  


Nodes decide what's good and bad.  You vote by running the version of bitcoin you think is best. 




Exactly.  Hard forks aren't always done explicitly to make new coins.  Hardforks sometimes hard forks are for fixing bugs [here](
As you can see Bitcoin has come a long way since way back then lol.

No, the fundamental problem with PoS is that you need to trust that the stake holders can't somehow profit by fucking with the integrity of the coin.  It's entirely up to them. 
Since it can be profitable to profit from destroying the integrity of something. PoS is not a viable solution.  
PoW is still far better than PoS .. we're having a pool issue, the individual miners can still leave a pool and join other pools.  
There are better more mature ways to handle such a major change/issue than simply jumping and saying how high.  Perhaps with the new interest in bitcoin more miner developers will arise and it could help the situation.

I think the LN network has what would be the equivalent of "network neutrality" built in the sense of maybe "transaction neutrality".  My understanding is you when you're transmitting transactions you're going through an onion type protocol so everyone in the chain only know where they are getting bits from and sending bits too.
LN exists it's a fact whether or not governments accept it or not isn't really Bitcoin's concern.  This is the principle that got Bitcoin to where it is today and will continue towards inevitable success in the future.  Financial privacy isn't something we should compromise.  Governments should be forced by the people to follow proper evidence gathering practices and this is an effective manner in which to do so.

I have so little faith in Ethereum.  It's successful because people think that it's like cloud money, but it's not.  It doesn't interact outside of the blockchain.  Vitalik still has far too much pull in the project for it to be leading the charge in the cryptocurrency market.  
Also, proof of stake is a pathetic joke.  Casper will be Ethereum's downfall.

There are really only a handful of legitimate cryptocurrencies.  
Sure you can go to coinmarketcap and pull up over 1000 of them, but the majority of them are really more like stock than an actual currency. 
Look at SALT for example.  It looks like a great project, but i'm not really sure why SALT has a blockchain ... it seems kind of like a way of doing crowd funding and you have to buy salt to have a membership... which is cool.  I'm not sure if smart contracts are stored in salt or not that would be kind of cool.  
Then take something like Ripple for example.  Again .. not a crypto currency. Digital sure... but it's centralized and controlled by a business.  
When you look at the principles underlying Bitcoin and what makes it so attractive to use as a currency/store of value.  It's the decentralization.  Without decentralization it's not viable for long term use.

Yup, LTC is basically the same thing as btc only with a few minor changes but a long history great dev team.  Monero has privacy.  LTC is probably going to be the first to really have the lightning network up after BTC so cross chain atomic swaps.  Monero's problem is adaptive block sizes and disk space requirements for scaling.

Except now in addition to tanking the value of the coin with temporary FUD the corrupt stake holders who have just profited can simply buy back in and repeat.  
With PoW it requires significant capital investment and time to make new ASICs and retool the mining operations.  
Furthermore the dangers that PoW is exposed to from a 51% attack doesn't completely undermine the consensus mechanism for people who are trying to violate the protocol.  This varies with PoS because the implementation can vary significantly.  Would you be so kind as to suggest a few PoS coins that I can look into and evaluate?  
I don't think that either solution is without its flaws, but PoW remains to be the best solution currently.  I think that in the near future a new solution will emerge as superior to both and we can move to that.

So hardware wallets are not a dumb idea.  They are a very convenient and secure way to store your BTC and other crypto assets.  The private keys never leave the device.
Paper wallets are looked down upon because the difficulty in creating them securely it promotes address reuse.  This is why wallets like Trezor, Ledger, electrum have moved towards seeds.  Seeds are basically like private keys, but a seed points to multiple private keys so you don't need to store and back up every key, just the seed.  
You shouldn't print paper wallets because printers often are network connected and have memory to store the printed information.  
Paper isn't a good method to store your private keys or your seed as they are flammable.  It's better to secure them by imprinting them in steel or using a product like cryptosteel.

If you have an old computer you can install Ubuntu on it.  Connect to the internet and install electrum.  Then before starting electrum you would disconnect it from the internet and never connect it to the internet again.  (Also, you can get a spare hard drive 120 gb SSD from best buy and put it in a laptop to do this.  When you install Ubuntu you want to do full disk encryption)
Regardless if you go the electrum route or the ledger route.  It's absolutely vital that you write your seed down.   Currently ledgers aren't set to ship out until march.  There is the trezor, but it too is rather expensive, but totally worth it in the long run.   
Then Pick up a metal engraver and a stencil set.  Punch that seed into the steel and put that steel in a fire proof save.

This is why bcash is so flawed.  The mining pools having influence on the system is different than having control of the system.  Having only mining nodes be authorities on the network is dangerous because they can then change the protocol and the SPV clients have no choice but to accept their word as truth.  Having non-mining nodes provides another lever of control that maintains low barriers of entry.  Therefore a bad acting miner will be rejected from the network, nodes can choose to follow or not.  
The 51% attack is not the end of the world.  It simply puts the network in a state where trust in the system is reduced, but not entirely violated.    
@_date: 2018-01-15 03:24:13
The entire point of bitcoin in fact is that no one but the signer of the transaction can change it.  If a miner were to do this the transaction would be invalid as it could no longer be verified.  
The problem with malleability (what segwit fixes) is that the transaction id can be fudged a bit, which is a problem for smart contracts between parties which LN relies upon and therefore needed to be fixed.

I mean it depends on how much money you have invested.  
It's against the bitcoin way to keep your bitcoin on an exchange.  Why use bitcoin if you're just going to keep it on an exchange?  Your bank can take care of your money just as well.  You have FDIC protection there.  
In other words you don't have any bitcoin. 
If you've got enough invested to consider a trezor or a ledger then why not?  I'd imagine you would have at least 1000 or more invested?  Coinbase could go belly up.  MtGox did.  Would you be upset if you lost that bitcoin?  Would you kick yourself if what you had invested went up to 100k and you didn't get it because the exchange locked your funds?  I think coinbase allows multisig so you may want to look into that... it might be better.
By investing in a trezor and cryptosteel you aren't putting your trust in a company to implement their closed source software correctly.  You're not putting your trust in the government not to shut them down.  You're not putting your trust in a company that might have shady business practices.  
If you have 10k in btc you need to sell and you need to pay 20/30 bucks for the transaction to get to an exchange .. are you going to be butt hurt about that?   Mind the fee is decreasing and segwit can help with fees.  
When you sell will it be a panic sell or cash out for good type deal for money to live on?  If you can wait a day for the transaction to confirm then you can still get the transaction done pretty cheap.

@_date: 2018-01-02 20:04:56
Well as with anything look at the fundamentals.  
A lot of people like bitcoin because the protocol makes for a distributed balance of power across the world.  The fact that no single entity controls bitcoin and it can't really be shut down ... your account can't really be shut down.  It's very attractive to most long term investors.
If this isn't something that interests you in a financial product then I must ask why are you interested in Crypto at all?  A centralized platform like paypal is probably better if it is centralized.  
Aside from that then you can look at the people behind the coin.  Like the founder of what we know of as ripple today and stellar and his involvement with mtgox... things like this.  
If you do care about a coin's distributed power structure then I'd recommend you steer clear from proof of stake coins.  As you're putting your trust into people with money.  These stake holders systems can be compromised and the entire system is dependent upon the concept that "because they have the most to lose they should be trusted the most" ... that pre-supposes that it is impossible not to profit from the failure of a system.  Agree or disagree that's up to you, but that's my position.  
Remember the point of PoW with the blockchain is to establish a timeline for the transactions.  Miners are occasionally given a choice to either do the right thing and profit or do the wrong thing and not profit.  
@_date: 2018-01-26 04:34:18

False.  Monero 


A wallet is essentially just a big number.  You're suppose to use different wallets for each funding/transaction.  This is for security and privacy concerns.

The entire point of Bitcoin is that rather than putting your trust in people you put your trust in math and a voluntary network where people can come and go as they please and vote with resources.  
Beyond just the tech the community matters.  How do we deal with adversity?  
ETH has proven that you're putting your faith in people.  Many other alt coins are really no more than shady banks despite their best intentions.  
Talking tech.  LN offers true trustless instant transactions.  Significantly improves the privacy with off chain transactions (which I understand is something that might even be improved upon).  BCH doesn't have the dev team behind it because it's a scam to get more bitcoin.  ETH IMHO is dead because PoS isn't a suitable replacement for PoW.  PoW is really proof of time.  Litecoin is following bitcoin so that's cool.  Monero is neat for sure, but is expensive in terms of resources and is really nothing more than security through obscurity.   
So yeah .. there are a bunch of coins out there.  You can make money on them.  At the end of the day for most of them you're just putting your faith in a company, companies, or people who were early adopters who don't necessarily have the expertise to run secure financial networks.

I think you have a great attitude for Crypto and I'm really happy to have you in the community :) 
Personally I am very bullish on Bitcoin and I like Litecoin too.  Both of these communities have a lot of real diehards.  ETH I'm on the fence about personally I'm not a fan, but I can't argue with it's success.  Bitcoin cash however I'm very bearish on.  
It took me a very long time to research the whole bitcoin vs bitcoin cash thing .. so I think its fine if you want to just keep everything as is and HODL that shit to the moon.  Long term though it's going to be in your best interest to research these assets yourself and make your own decision when you're ready.  If not for the monetary gain, but mostly for the knowledge gains.  
Bitcoin goes up and Bitcoin goes down.  Don't worry too much about the 2.7 I'm confident that all of your coins will go up in value ... except BCH I mean it most likely will continue to see gains against the USD, but I think in a couple of years that will die out too.

Immediately nothing bad would happen.  Short term things could get rocky.  Pools could collude.  Pools could be shut down and perhaps some 51% attacks might arise (not the end of the world, but not good of course) ... Miners could conceivably force their hand in terms of the protocol (good short term bad long term).
Basically the centralization issue that bitcoin is working through at the moment would be highlighted.

Now full nodes preserve the integrity of the entire blockchain.  This way everyone can fully validate the bitcoin protocol.  If miners publish a bad block then they will be rejected by the nodes and ultimately not receive the reward.  This gives the full nodes the authority to do a UASF.  Think checks and balances.  You have devs, nodes, miners and they all have to pick their battles.

No I'm totally with you.  on Bip38, but seriously you need to keep up with the times.  I was resistant like you.  
You gotta do the seed and you gotta get the seed punched in steel.  You need to have your bitcoin secured in a fireproof method.
I recommend using openssl to encrypt your seed.  It's not a 32 word seed it's 12 or 24 word seed AFAIK I haven't seen any wallet support 32.  
Electrum supports segwit.

If you use different address to receive and send BTC to then you gain some privacy advantages, of course they are limited.
Not to mention you didn't address the security risk.  I'm a fan of being as paranoid as possible.  
If you have one address that sends BTC out from... and then another address sent you BTC too... maybe you know who sent it to you.. maybe you don't.
You do raise an interesting point... If a company like Coinbase sends their payments individually from smaller wallets its more difficult to discern your address from other addresses .. you can probably still do it to a degree with timestamps... still batching would make it really easy to distinguish a payout from another.

If you're going to generate a private key offline you want that to be on a computer that is never connected to the internet after the keys are generated.  There are many ways of doing this and that's cool... but all you've effectively done is created a hardware wallet.  Good job.  
There are other ways information on paper can be destroyed.  Yes having multiple copies is good, but you then also need to use something like BIP39 in order to prevent the bitcoin from being stolen if they are kept outside of your home.  Keeping multiple copies inside your home doesn't prevent all of them from going up in smoke.
How do you spend from a paper wallet?  Does that need to be done from a computer done connected to the internet?  How easy is it to do that?  Seriously if you can tell me I would appreciate it because I'm not familiar with any easy ways to do this.  
For a couple hundred dollars you have a separate device that allows you to create a wallet, restore a wallet and send with a device that keeps the private keys offline.
You can get similar functionality with electrum.  Install electrum on a dedicated computer and export the public keys to a watch only wallet and open it in electrum with an internet connected device and you're good to go, but it's not as seamless.
So fundamentally seeds are superior to paper wallets and having a fire resistant method of storage is superior to paper.

You get a seed a list of 12-24 words typically based on the BIP39 protocol.  You save that seed ideally in a fireproof method.  
If your device is lost or stolen you simply get a new device and recover the seed based on the manufacturer's instructions.
If it is using the BIP39 standard there are implementations online that will allow you to recover the private keys without the device.
Some fire resistant methods are punching your seed into steel.. or cryptosteel.

So the Trezor was the first hardware wallet and they have a great reputation.  Buy it from [here](
The Trezor has a reputation for being very secure like the ledger.  The private keys never leave the device.   


What is dead may never die.  The Trezor actually doesn't have any batteries.  It's USB powered. 


This is why you need to copy your seed.  Your seed is based on a public standard called BIP39 and Trezor's implementation is on github.  Should Trezor ever go out of business or whatever you'd be able to recover your wallet with your seed.

You can get your private key off of blockchain.info using the directions [here](
You can't do it with no fees, but you should be able to do it with low fees.  Try something like 7 sats per byte and it should go through, but might take a while which should be alright.  Should cost about 20 cents.

@_date: 2018-01-21 18:59:20
No, because this would provide an incentive for miners to spam the network and increase their control over the network. 
Blocksize increases need to be done in such a manner that a low barrier to entry is needed to becoming a node on the network.  Ideally these nodes would be mining as well, but due to the economics of Bitcoin right now thats not possible.  Hopefully soon we will see some growth in that space and we can balance things out, but right now that isn't the case. 
By allowing larger blocksizes you raise the barrier to entry of running a node in terms of disk space and bandwidth.  These will improve overtime but not at the same rate as bitcoin, at least not for the foreseeable future.  It creates an attack vector for miners to price nodes out and therefore they have more control over the network.
This would entirely defeat the purpose of Bitcoin.

If you're fine with potentially losing your BTC fine, but while I have used coinami and have no negative experiences with it.  I think you need to consider the possibility of bad actors trying to exploit this forkening in order to gain access to some BTC.  
So it's strongly recommended that you begin to take proper steps in properly securing your BTC and claiming your fork coins in a safe and secure manner.  IE your private keys are never on a device that talks to the internet.
You can look through my history I have some posts going over how to claim some various forks.   
Jimmy Song is running a bitcoin forking business helping people gain access to their funds so if you have a good amount of bitcoin and want to pay someone to do it that's an option.  
I'd help you for a small fee but again you should really be more careful with your BTC than trusting randoms on the internet.  
[here is a link to my write up](
@_date: 2018-01-23 00:19:06
listen to the white paper.
Basically Bitcoin is a digital currency that allows the transfer of value in a trustless manner.  It's a distributed system and it has a decentralized power structure making it very difficult to shut down.  
First lets talk about public and private key hashing.  Basically you take a set of data and run it through an algorithm with your private key.  This private key is something only you hold on to.  Then you give people your public key.  They can take the message you sent and verify it against the public key with your signature.  This ensures that you and only you wrote the message and it wasn't altered in any way in transmission. 
So the blockchain is a chain of blocks.  Think of a block like a ledger and it debits and credits accounts in transactions.  A transaction is valid if it passes certain tests.  Does the account have enough bitcoin to make the transaction?  Is the signature valid from the sending account?  Things like this.
You have nodes they validate blocks that miners produce and they are responsible for sharing the blockchain across the network and ignoring bad actors and rejecting bad blocks.
Miners write the blocks.  They do this by basically cracking a private key that is based on the previous block.  This consumes a lot of power, but don't worry the private key they are trying to crack is WAY easier than anything you'd use for a bitcoin address.  Instead of being able to crack a bitcoin private key with a computer 1 million times more powerful than the current bitcoin network ... sometime way after the heat death of the universe... the bitcoin network can crack these private keys in about 10 minutes.  Sometimes faster sometimes slower.  Its an average. The first miner to find the key can then write the block and broadcast it.  They get a mining reward and the transaction fees if the nodes accept the block.  If the block is valid all the other miners start working on the next block.  If it is invalid they keep working on the same block until a valid block is submitted. 
If 2 miners find the block at the same time and they submit a valid block.. some miners will work on either one or the other.  Eventually one chain will win out and the longest chain is the accepted one.
So you create a wallet with something like Electrum and get a private key. Make sure you save your seed securely preferably in a fire proof method.  Then buy bitcoin from somewhere and they will send you bitcoin.  When you want to send it to another address. you get the address and create a transaction with the amount you want to send and broadcast a signed transaction.  The other people can see your public key and therefore they know the transaction is valid.  
@_date: 2018-01-21 21:08:39
Is your coin properly secured?  You got something like cryptosteel backing up your seed?  You got a proper cold/frozen AF storing technique?  Work on it and plan to hold for another 3-4 years just forget about bitcoin.

Did you get your bitcoin diamond? Bitcoin gold?  Bitcore and the other 3 or 4 forks? 
I don't know if the trezor supported all of those forks.  So you'd have to recover the seed outside of the trezor with a bip39 wallet and then go through the process.  For me I had to put my private key into some other applications.  I refused to do that until after I moved my BTC out of their original wallet.  I chose to go with a bech32 address which Trezor doesn't support yet, but I believe Trezor supports the older version of Segwit.  
Anyway it's been a while since I did that and the liquidity of the other forks has probably gone down significantly.  
Also, if you've moved that BCH to sell it into BTC (which would have been a smart play and still is IMHO) you broadcasted your full public key to the BCH network.  
 
In the security section while the known issues of security have been fixed there may be other unknown attacks.  This is why address reuse is it's considered a security risk. 
Either one of these reasons is significant enough for me to move my coins, but it's up to you.

From now on your wallet.dat file and your bitcoin wallet should not be on any device that isn't airgapped. 
Then with Electrum make a new seed wallet.  Write down the seed at least 2 times.  
Send some money to an exchange where you can sell some of it and invest in a hardware wallet like the trezor or ledger.  Then invest in cryptosteel.

@_date: 2018-01-15 12:19:23
First step is you want to make sure your bitcoin is secure. You need to employ the proper security measures to be successful.
Claim and transfer only one coin(fork) at a time to an exchange. When you do bcash ONLY do bcash etc. This is important. A lot of people mess this up and send bcash to a bgold address on the exchange and what not and that’s it your money is gone. It will be way worse than pulling teeth to get those coins from the exchange support if you can get them at all.
Move your Bitcoin out of their old public addresses preferably into a new bech32 segwit address. Electrum is a good wallet to do this with. I recommend doing this offline if you can. Make sure you have their latest as they just had a critical security release, IMHO it wasn’t a big deal your wallets should always be encrypted anyway. Regardless of your wallet preferences please make sure to back up your seeds in a fireproof method such as cryptosteel or simply a punch set or dremel into steel.
Now you’ll want to make a binance account, maybe a kucoin account, gate.io, and bit-z … This way as you claim your coins you can transfer them into a useful coin like Bitcoin or Litecoin and move them to a secure address. Right now since we’re in a transition period I recommend using LTC for faster cheaper transfers and it’s a good coin. I think long term LTC following in the foot steps of BTC with the lightning network will serve to be useful.
On your android device you’ll need 3 apps. Coinomi (write down the seeds and passwords as you would with any other long term wallet don’t treat this any differently, but maybe you don’t need to put it into steel), Bitpie, and bither. In your bitcoin wallet electrum with the wallet of your old private key you’ll want to hit view&gt;addresses and then in the addresses tab pull up the QR code for your private key that you transferred your BTC out of in step 1. Then in Coinomi you’ll want to get your bcash and bitcoin gold by scanning that private key into a bcash (bitcoin cash) and bitcoin gold wallet respectively. Then you can send that over to Binance.
To claim your bitcoin diamond and super bitcoin you’ll need bitpie and bither. Make sure you write down the seeds and passwords. They are important. You open bither. go to settings up top right with the gear then click “advanced options” Then you want to select “import private key” and “From Private key text” . Then you hit the camera and scan the same QR code you did for coinami (the QR code of your old private key that you transferred out of in step 1) .
Then with bitpie you need to make a wallet for bitcoin super and diamond. Screenshot the wallet address and what I ended up doing is uploading it to google drive pulling it up on my computer then going back into bither then sending my super bitcoin and such to the address I created in bitpie that I pulled up from google drive on my computer.
Then I sent the bcash to binance along with the bitcoin gold, I sent the super bitcoin and diamond to gate.io and the bitcore to bit-z … Bitcore isn’t really going to be worth it unless you have like 10 bitcoin or so it will get you like .5 LTC
But yeah… if you have 10 bitcoin or so you probably have about $30,000 USD worth of forked alt coins out there you can claim and put back into BTC. Enjoy.
Since segwit bech32 is still new not every exchange is going to support it yet. I recommend moving your long term BTC holdings into a bech32 address and your fork holdings converting that into litecoin and holding it there.

Incorporate different methods of generating Multisig seeds.  You can use your computer to get a good one then augment that with fair dice.  
The machines that create the seeds never touches the internet.
Encrypt the seeds.  
Verify recovery 
Save the wallet addresses in random order, but you keep the addresses segregated by seeds.  Not the public master key. Obviously no private keys.  
Incinerate the computers. 
Fire resistant/proof cold storage with something like cryposteel
Multiple backups located around the world in various types of facilities.   
Send the coins to the addresses in varying relatively small amounts.  The seeds that are the most difficult to access get the most coins.  For example if you need to go to NYC, Japan, and Brazil,  Maybe Europe to get some passwords.
That's how I would do it.

Well number 1 you can choose not to send it from coinbase ... you can and should send it yourself.  There are ways to anonymize your transactions.
Number 2 despite them being able to see the transaction they have no ability to stop the transaction or freeze your assets. 
If you take the proper precautions if you're ever wrongfully accused of a crime and they freeze your assets you can still access your funds to pay for a lawyer and prevent your credit from being ruined etc. etc.

I mean we don't even know the exchange you're on.  Regardless 13k isn't something I'd play around with.  Take the BTC put it in a secure wallet back up the seed in something like cryptosteel and stop looking at the price.  
We had a very fast run up to 20k and this consolidation is healthy for the market.  In the long run HODLing is by far the best strategy.. I wish when I first bought in I listened ...

It's not stupid. Basically segwit is a protocol change in Bitcoin that allows users to use a new address format and it takes the signature out of the block and it gets rid of transaction malleability which is necessary for LN.   So because the largest part of your signature isn't in the block (which is where the fee comes into play) your transaction is smaller and therefore you pay less in fees.
I believe you must have your BTC in a segwit address before you make the transaction in order to reap the benefits IE you need to send BTC from a segwit address to a segwit address but I am not 100% sure on this.  
So in Electrum you'd create a segwit wallet and then send your BTC into your segwit wallet.
I also do recommend the seeds as compared to the old school paper wallet method.  My understanding is that the 12-24 word seeds are just as secure and it provides a method of recovery.  You can read more about it with BIP39, although electrum has a different standard.  One of the issues with the old school paper wallet method is that you are tempted to reuse addresses which is a bitcoin nono.
An additional cool feature is you can export a public key seed from electrum then load electrum on a computer that is not connected to the internet and see your BTC addresses in a watch only wallet.  Then you can make transactions and sign them offline securely then broadcast them that way.  This way your private keys are never on an internet connected device.

A lot of people mess this up and send bcash to a bgold address on the exchange and what not and that’s it your money is gone. It will be way worse than pulling teeth to get those coins from the exchange support if you can get them at all.
Move your Bitcoin out of their old public addresses preferably into a new bech32 segwit address. Electrum is a good wallet to do this with. I recommend doing this offline if you can. Make sure you have their latest as they just had a critical security release, IMHO it wasn’t a big deal your wallets should always be encrypted anyway. Regardless of your wallet preferences please make sure to back up your seeds in a fireproof method such as cryptosteel or simply a punch set or dremel into steel.
Now you’ll want to make a binance account, maybe a kucoin account, gate.io, and bit-z … This way as you claim your coins you can transfer them into a useful coin like Bitcoin or Litecoin and move them to a secure address. Right now since we’re in a transition period I recommend using LTC for faster cheaper transfers and it’s a good coin. I think long term LTC following in the foot steps of BTC with the lightning network will serve to be useful.
On your android device you’ll need 3 apps. Coinomi (write down the seeds and passwords as you would with any other long term wallet don’t treat this any differently, but maybe you don’t need to put it into steel), Bitpie, and bither. In your bitcoin wallet electrum with the wallet of your old private key you’ll want to hit view&gt;addresses and then in the addresses tab pull up the QR code for your private key that you transferred your BTC out of in step 1. Then in Coinomi you’ll want to get your bcash and bitcoin gold by scanning that private key into a bcash (bitcoin cash) and bitcoin gold wallet respectively. Then you can send that over to Binance.
To claim your bitcoin diamond and super bitcoin you’ll need bitpie and bither. Make sure you write down the seeds and passwords. They are important. You open bither. go to settings up top right with the gear then click “advanced options” Then you want to select “import private key” and “From Private key text” . Then you hit the camera and scan the same QR code you did for coinami (the QR code of your old private key that you transferred out of in step 1) .
Then with bitpie you need to make a wallet for bitcoin super and diamond. Screenshot the wallet address and what I ended up doing is uploading it to google drive pulling it up on my computer then going back into bither then sending my super bitcoin and such to the address I created in bitpie that I pulled up from google drive on my computer.
Then I sent the bcash to binance along with the bitcoin gold, I sent the super bitcoin and diamond to gate.io and the bitcore to bit-z … Bitcore isn’t really going to be worth it unless you have like 10 bitcoin or so it will get you like .5 LTC
But yeah… if you have 10 bitcoin or so you probably have about $30,000 USD worth of forked alt coins out there you can claim and put back into BTC. Enjoy.
Since segwit bech32 is still new not every exchange is going to support it yet. I recommend moving your long term BTC holdings into a bech32 address and your fork holdings converting that into litecoin and holding it there.

I don't know what Pure Lightning is, but you don't need to break channels everyday with the lightning protocol.  If that's a shitty implementation don't use it. 
IOTA is a steaming pile of shit and therefore anything built upon it is not needed.
Lightning is meant to be the solution.  The idea is to use lightning rather than standard Bitcoin transactions for most transactions.  
All a centralized provider could do on lightning is not offer you their services ... that's it.  You can route around it

In bitcoin you have your lottery.  That's leader selection.  The "voting" is the exact same process the next "selected "leader" determines the validity of the previous block hence longest chain wins.  
So how do you decouple something from itself.  They are the exact same thing.
How about you stop trying to act like you're not trying to mislead people with your false analogies.

It does.  It's very clear that it does because we all agree that increasing the block size will lead to decreased fees.  You're increasing costs to operate the network and since the block size isn't determined by a market unless the block size is larger than the market's demand ... At which point the fees are no longer capable of sustaining the miners.  


How are you evaluating market share?

@_date: 2019-07-20 12:51:06
Example? we can
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:06:06
1.  Basically a miner is running a node and a node has processed all of the blocks up to the current time.  So the miner's software knows the current state of the blockchain ... you can think of it as a ledger.
2.  Yes, otherwise the network would reject the block and the miner wouldn't be paid.  IE if a bcash miner mines on Bitcoin's blockchain and finds the hash and creates an 8 mb block it would be rejected and the bcash miner would lose and get nothing. No reward no fees. 
3.  I don't know.  I would think it would be easier to just drop the lowest fee transaction.  
4.  So the miners will be running different software, but they will be following a compatible  protocol or they will be excluded from the network.  It takes different software to run the ASICs etc like drivers and different management software etc.

Yeah they are fucking ridiculous.  Their customer service staff is generic they clearly are not trained on bitcoin works.  
A friend of mine who is just getting into Bitcoin signed up and got a ledger nano trying to start off right.  He made a withdrawal to his ledger nano and it worked fine.  He tried to do it again, but accidentally had coinbase send the bitcoin to the address that sent his first transaction.  So basically he had coinbase send his bitcoin to coinbase instead of himself.  Just not a deposit address.
Ideally he'd just call someone they would see what happened.  Oh Coinbase send to coinbase... okay sir we've credited your account with the BTC please be more careful next time.  I mean maybe a "let me check with my manager" 
No.  instead this customer service representative raises her voice and tells him it's a Temporary wallet and the coins are effectively burned (paraphrasing here) 
Like wow not only did this rep fail at basic customer service, but clearly she was not trained and is not knowledgeable about how blockchain works.  The transactions are on the blockchain and that's immutable evidence.
I am really disappointed with coinbase and have been mentioning them as an option, but now I'm actually going to tell people to just stay away.

You make a very good point and I have thought about this a lot.  I'm currently listening to the Tom Wood's podcast  "The Debate Within Bitcoin: Jameson Lopp vs. Roger Ver on Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash"
I'm taking notes.  My answer to you now is this. 
Any new product or service if it's going to be successful is going to have growing pains.  Bitcoin is not primetime yet. Increasing the blocksize is not a legitimate long term solution.  
I think you and I can agree on these few points. 
Bitcoin as we know it today is both a store of value and a mechanism with which to exchange it.  The internet is a medium of exchange .. just not a medium of exchange of value.  
When you buy into bitcoin you're buying a service.  Very robust durable data storage.  By increasing the blocksize you're devaluing bitcoin in the same way that you would if you increased the coin supply limit.
Gold is valuable because it is scarce.  Air is FAR more usable and important than gold, but because it is not scarce it is not valuable in the sense we pay for it.  At least not yet.
The decision to change the blocksize should and will be made when Bitcoin has a legitimate competitor.  It's going to be on the lightning network.  People will be able to trade between bitcoin and other alt coins without centralized exchanges.    
@_date: 2017-12-25 19:47:30

I agree that BTC going to 8 mb wouldn't hurt BTC im the short term however it fucks the future when btc scaling is more important.  Its like the baby boomers raiding the social security fund in the 80s.  Sure it was great then but fucks us now.  
Changing the block size is easy but there are other avenues we need to explore before tapping that well.  
I'm very optimistic.for segwit and LN and we need to put pressure on coinbase and other major players to support it.  
The fundamentals matter and right now Bitcoin has the best history and talent behind it

Technically you're not correct.  You can receive Bitcoin with either wallet provided the configuration is correct.  You just can't verify or spend unless you import the priv keys into the correct wallet.
You don't need to be online to receive you just need a valid address. So legacy addresses.  So legacy addresses only.
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:32:39
Basically the miners are trying to find a private key of a very simple Bitcoin address.  One that its estimated the network can find in about 10 minutes.
With this private key they can write the block with the transactions sign it and propagate it.  
Think of it as a lottery.  Whoever wins gets to write the block aka put the transactions in and get the reward and fees

You sound like you'd be a great CEO of myspace.  Just sit in the pot until the water starts to boil.  
Let me ask you something.  Do you control demand?  Do you determine whether or not something goes viral? 
When you use a company or service and the product or service fucking sucks do you go back to it or do you say fuck that shit and never give them the time of day again?  
Me personally, unless it's a brand new company kind of beta testing a new service I'm very unforgiving.  
We're beta testing bitcoin now it's time to be forgiving but primetime is coming soon.  Either we get on the progress train and move forward or we get left behind because if we don't do it someone else will.  
Does Bcash offer instant trustless transactions? No.  LN does
Does Bcash enable truly private transactions?  No.  LN does. Better than Monero too.  
Does Bcash enable micro-transactions... no LN does.  
Does Bcash make P2P autonomous corporations possible?  No... LN does.  
When the lightening network comes it's more important than ever that the network remains secure.  That means nodes need to be able to be implemented and mining financially sustainable.  The value of the blockchain transaction must be maintained.  
When the LN network is activated it's going to reduce the number of transactions recorded on the block chain and therefore reduce the inherent value of a transaction on the block chain... necessarily the transaction fees will plummet.  
If you increase the blocksize now you're dropping the value of the transaction fee and then when LN is activated the devaluation of a bitcoin transaction is compounded.  
Also, programmers are a lot like the priests of the middle ages.  Being able to read and understand code is like knowing latin and being able to read the bible.  In other words normal people don't understand what the fuck we're talking about.  They have no clue.  
At the end of the day Bitcoin is a perfect democracy.  People can decide their level of participation voluntarily.  This means however that it has some vulnerabilities that a democracy has.  If you have enough money you can buy enough votes to steer the boat in the wrong direction.  It's important now to teach future generations that raising the block chain isn't a decision that should be made lightly.

@_date: 2017-12-21 01:58:46


Maybe I don't understand what you're trying to say here.  It sounds like you're implying that the LN doesn't really reduce the number of transactions necessary to go on to the blockchain.  That once channels are used to send coins through if one party wants to close a channel all subsequent channels must close for the coins to move. This is incorrect.  It's not recursive. As coins are passed through the network each channel remains independent of the other channels.  In other words the lightening network is using tail recursion.  
@_date: 2018-09-25 17:37:33
Probably a bad idea.  The margins on mining crypto are pretty thin.  There are two ways to do this right?  They own the hardware and you rent it or you own the hardware and they just host it, but you determine the pool you are in and where your payouts go so they don't touch your crypto.
The later is better because you have more control over which pools you're supporting and they don't touch your crypto.  What's nice about this option is there is more of a possibility of you getting your hands on the hardware and selling it to get funding to upgrade your hardware. 
The former is what I consider to be "cloud mining" and it's a bad idea.  They determine where your hash power goes, they control your keys until they decide to pay you.  You are pre-purchasing a contract for a specific term. During that time a new miner could come out rendering your hashing power to be no longer viable.  They could also easily setup a type of ponzi scheme.  
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:57:16


Get the lightening network up and running.  Then you can decide if adjustments need to be made or not.  If after the LN is up and being used then you see there is no issue with resources okay keep the 1 mb... if there is still resources issues and the problem is getting worse okay then we still have a card to play in raising the blocksize.  Bitcoins price is high then 1 mb is great.  We still have plenty of motivation with the block reward to ensure mining continues to grow. 
8 MB is absurd.  It too is an arbitrary number.  So was 21 million and this is a number that must never change .. but this goes to show right now investing in mining is a long term thing.
8 MB you're pretty much eventually committing to a 500 gb hard drive every year to run a node.  
Remember before it was Bitcoin Cash it was Bitcoin Unlimited.  As I have demonstrated here we cannot accept unlimited block sizes or even significantly large block sizes as it will necessarily result in a high barrier to entry to running nodes and mining pools which is therefore centralizing bitcoin.  
We do not control the price of bitcoin.  We do however control the supply and access to it.  For day to day transactions the LN is more than sufficient and is in fact better than writing to the blockchain consistently.  However without the blockchain the LN cannot exist.  It is needed in case a party fails a contract or a channel needs to be closed for whatever reason.

Oh no it's going to reduce fees a LOT.  You're going to want to keep your channels open for as long as possible.  


LN is valid for all types of transactions.  You really only need to go to the block chain when you close a channel or there is a bad actor.  Otherwise there is strong incentive to keep your channels open.  
Think of LN as a currency that is backed by bitcoin as we know it today.  It's similar to old money that was backed by gold except you don't need to trust anyone to get your gold back.

@_date: 2017-12-24 20:31:20
Not really.  They would make more money with BTC than Bcash as big blocks keep fees cheap... for now.  It's actually far more insidious than that.  
Basically by increasing the block size it increases the costs on the nodes ... the protectors of the network.  Nodes don't get paid.  
Less nodes the easier it is for the miners to take control of the network and boom.  A handful of companies which can be taken down by coordinated attacks from government.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:57:50
That's bull shit.  Before it was Bcash it was BitcoinUnlimited.  That's their fucking master plan for scaling.  Their fud is all about how LN is going to lead to centralization.  Bcash is a scam through and through. 
You can put a layer 2 on bcash... but LN is going to reduce the load significantly on the blockchain.  You want there to be a cost associated with writing to the blockchain.  It helps everyone.  It makes the LN work better, the miners get more money, the network is secure.  We still have years to figure out if the block size needs to adjust and the cost of running a node and starting up a new one continues to be affordable and you can forecast future costs.
Going to 8mb is a fucking joke.  
After LN is on what would be the point of keeping channels open if you can use the network willy nilly.  Then LN is weak and all the super cool shit like autonomous corporations is on pause.  You can spam the network again with dust transactions.  
Then could you imagine the PR political nightmare involved in lowering the block size?  It looks stupid.  Computer people might understand it no one else will. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:11:49
Its not limited to 8mb .. it can go to 32 mb and their master plan to scale is just to continue increasing the blocksize.
It's not just a matter of hard drive space.   The reality is even at 32 mb block size the transactions per second rate is unimpressive. It slows the growth of bitcoin and LTC would win and BTC would be in a state where it could no longer compete with other coins.  
Forget about running 4000 transactions a second on a 10 mb connection you're going to need a gig.. and again .. 4000 transactions a second isn't impressive for what bitcoin is suppose to be.

Bitcoin takes real processing power and resources to run and keep Bitcoin decentralized.  Decentralized in the sense that no group has too much power.  I listened to Roger Ver's debate on the Tom Woods show.  Either he doesn't understand the technology and how it fits into an economic model, but blocksize isn't a resource that can be managed by the free market.  This hasn't been the case for YEARS because we had to put a minimum fee on to prevent spam.  


Okay that's a website that uses an equation... and that's Market cap... # of coins * most recent price for coin.. sort... THAT IS NOT MARKET SHARE.  Market share would be how much value was paid in fees over the medium.  ... How many people are buying Intel vs. AMD ... you don't evaluate Intels' market share to AMD's market share by saying Intel made 7 million chips and sells them at 450 a piece.  There is something called liquidity.  Compare those numbers on crypto.  People are spending 126000 ish or so every 10 minutes to transfer money on the bitcoin network.   No one is using BCH.  It's like 16000 in fees for an entire day... They can't even fill up a 1 mb block consistently.  15000 transactions an hour vs 373,179 transactions an hour.  


There is a reason and this is why no one takes big blockers seriously. Core admits plainly that the block size needs to be increased, but after exhausting other available options.  They did it with segwit.  They plan to do it again with the lightning network.  
Bitcoin does not derive it's value based on the number of people who use it.  It derives it's value by being a better medium of exchange than other options in terms of being trusted and decentralized.  In other words it is more important right now for the next few months to keep bitcoin's decentralized nature in tact over being able to buy coffee with it. We're talking about something that is competing to take over the market for world currency in the next 10-15 years .. not 150 years..  
The truth of the matter is Bitcoin doesn't even matter.  What matters is the technology.  If we go into big blocks and we do as big blockers and Ver say.  It's not a tech I will support and it will fail.  It will be defeated by another crypto currency that adhered to the principles of decentralization and being censorship resistant.

I follow you. I agree, but it isn't going to happen overnight.  That's my point.  At absolute best case scenario it's going to take 6 months for that to happen in my opinion.

You're wrong.  Learn the bitcoin protocol and do the fucking math. 
You CANNOT increase the blocksize indefinitely and NOT run into resource issues for running nodes.  Nodes are vital for the operation of bitcoin.  
1MB every 10 minutes is roughly 7 transaction a second on average.  Thats NOTHING.  2 MB .. .that's 14 transaction a second.  What do you then need to handle 4000 transactions a second (again nothing compared to how bitcoin is suppose to scale)?  Roughly a blocksize of 572 megabytes.
Miners are racing the clock here pal.  They don't have time to write a 572 meg fucking block.  How long does it take to download 572 megabytes and propagate that throughout the bitcoin network?  We all don't have access to a gigabit connection.  At that block size you can't run a node on less than a 10 megabit connection.  It takes 13 minutes to download then you have to download another 572 megs. 
So you want to mine on your own.  You need a gigabit connection and the race conditions the network is going to have to deal with its going to be amazing.  You want to run a node at minimum you're running a 15 mbps connection and you're not providing much value to the network at that point and your connection is dedicated.  
572 megabytes every 10 minutes.  30 fucking terabytes of storage if you want a full node (which you're not making money on mind you).    Sure you can prune it but there is value in being able to run a full node with a moderate cost.  52 gigs a year can be planned for very reliably and is accessible to a much wider range of people from varying economic statuses and the cost to run a useful node goes down over time.  
That's decentralization. 
The lightening network is the next step of bitcoin.  It's amazing and every bit as ground breaking as bitcoin was perhaps even more.  It's mind blowing when you truly understand it.  
The revolution is coming in the next 5 years not the next 100 years. Bitcoins growth is logarithmic  the shit's happening in the next few years not 100 years we don't have time for moore law.

Bcash was created so that Jihan wu could continue to have control of the asic market with his patented asicboost which was rendered obsolete by segwit.  This is why they fought so hard against it

Simply put it is not a viable scaling solution.  Maybe if we wait 200 years after we die....or centralize it.
It's a scam because we did effectively increase the blocksize with segwit.  It was a great compromise it took a chunk out of covert asicboost and increased the block size.
Think of Bcash as an empty 128 lane highway.  It can only transport motorcycles.
Think of Bitcoin as a  16 lane highway with 4 normal lanes and 12 HOV lanes that lightning bolt buses can run on.

Ethereum is more like AOL.  Where AOL was a closed environment.  It was fun during it's time.  Since Ethereum is built to be 1 blockchain that fits everything in an enclosed environment.  
Bitcoin is like the internet back in 1992 when AOL was cool.  The internet kind of sucked.  However it was a much more diverse and open environment.  
Bitcoin with the LN and cross chain atomic swaps is that environment.  Other coins are able to merge mine with Bitcoin, Other coins can setup their own malleability fix and interact with Bitcoin over the lightning network.  
There is no token on ethereum that inherently benefited from ethereum's platform.   It just makes it easy to spin up a new token.  Any long standing project built on ethereum should be looking to get off of it.

This is completely wrong.
Pool A finds the hash for a block and publishes it.  
At the same time Pool B finds the hash for their block and publishes it.  
Now miners choose who's block to try and extend.  
If the next block extends the block from pool B then the block from pool A will be orphaned.  Unless of course miners keep working on the block from pool A and it becomes longer than the chain built upon the block from pool B.

So this isn't anything new to bitcoiners.  This decline down started weeks ago back when bitcoin was at like 800... then to 7... then to 6.  What happened earlier this week down to 400 was panic.  Like what happened with China.  Bitcoin moved from weak hands (those who don't really believe in bitcoin) to strong hands (those who are faithful to bitcoin)  
The crash was too fast.  Nothing crashes that fast and doesn't see a bounce.  Now we're settled and will likely see a slow rise back up to 1000 then cue Ohh bitcoin's going to crash short short short... and when that doesn't happen hello 5000.  Then we'll crash to 2000... then well go back to 4500.. then well crash back down to 3000, then we'll go back up to 4000 .. then crash back down to 2100 then bounce back to 2800 and begin our ride up again ... next stop maybe 10K maybe 25K who knows.

There is a US exchange.. arguably a couple of them.  Campbx and coinbase.  The reason is Fincen regulations deem them as money transmitters.  Its a very broad interpretation of the guideline and I believe it to be incorrect.  However the nature of bitcoin is such that it is very important for law enforcement to track money laundering.  Therefore they found this regulation and are re-purposing it for this use as a bandaid until the laws really catch up.  Basically it requires exchanges to be registered in all 50 states as money transmitters and that is a long expensive process.

You thick piece of ignorant shit.  That's where the saying comes from "Selling shovels in a gold rush" comes from.  
It's not literally shovels.  It's mining equipment. You can set your shovel somewhere and start digging and if there is no gold there you just wasted a whole lot of time.  You could spend a lot less time if you had heavy machinery.  More ground covered more likelihood you'll find some gold.  
ASIC Bitcoin miners just dig really quickly and cover a lot of ground.  If they find the key great they found the "gold".  Otherwise they get nothing.
Bitcoin miners do not produce a god damn thing.  They find bitcoins.

A Satoshi is the smallest onchain increment.  If between channels there is a millisat balance it's rounded on closing the channel.
It just rounds down to the nearest Satoshi so even if its .999 millisats it will round down.

You can't increase the blocksize without a hardfork.  There will always be political issues with that. Segwit increased the maximum effective blocksize to almost 4 megs and its reasonable.
It's important that Bitcoin remain as lightweight as possible.  This way it always can resort to operating over Tor or other networks  like satellite networks which won't always follow Moore's law etc.

@_date: 2018-05-01 11:47:52
I went to the full interview.


No... It's a fucking datastructure.  Bitcoin offers the risks/rewards he's talking about.
Bitcoin has many backups.  The key point is that it's blockchain is immutable. 
He touched on the fact that financial privacy was TAKEN not given.  I'd argue that Bitcoin isn't really a tool (yet) for easy financial privacy, but if we're ever going to get there first we need a financial system beyond the control of banks and governments. 
This guy ignores the fact that transactions in the central banking system almost always can be reversed.  Once a transaction is in a block it's got a very high degree of certainty of being there forever.  Each block added upon it cements the transfer of value. 
Not to mention the government can't seize your Bitcoin if you secure it properly. 
I just love how he mentions that gold was what the private bank notes represented with private currency.  So far doesn't mention we went to a system where the dollar is now the store of value and we separated from gold. 
This fucking interviewer's twitch whenever she says Blockchain instead of Bitcoin is infuriating. 
He kind of misses the point that Bitcoin is its own store of value and that the Bitcoin protocol is the entity that is more trust worthy than Government. 
I agree that people shouldn't be going into debt to buy Bitcoin.  
Not familiar with his history of money, but it does seem to be a nice story.
Gold isn't easily divisible.  Bitcoin is.  The way you divide gold is with IOUs and fractional reserve banking.
I love how this guy talks about occupy and then supports the system that has become extraordinarily efficient at centralizing wealth among the few. 
How does nature help us with freedom.  That shit makes no fucking sense. 
The idea behind Bitcoin is that the people are now in charge of the monetary system.  If Banks fuck up the government doesn't get to decide to bail them out.  
He doesn't understand the technical limitations of why other crypto currencies cannot compete with Bitcoin realistically long term.  Ethereum is a dead project as far as I am concerned.  Casper is vaperware and they already have ASICs.  A Turing complete centrally controlled coin seems stupid.  Bcash lol ... 99.99 % of crypto currencies out there have no long term viability.  
This guy is a PHD with an elementary understanding cryptocurrencies.  The SEC will have some disclosure over the issuance of Bitcoin ... LOLLLOLLLOLLLOLOLOLOL!!!!!

My understanding is what you say is true.  Theoretically it is possible to do what you said.  The miners are suppose to take the first tx, but really nothing stops them from taking a new tx with a higher fee.
zero conf txes are reasonably secure for small purchases.  Why pay a huge fee to buy coffee.  Just like card txes can be reversed for 3-6 months bitcoin tx are not finalized until they are in a block . In certain circumstances you'd want multiple confirmations.

In my opinion they are both pseudo anonymous.  With day to day use Bitcoin is far easier to track than cash is.  
Now in your Starbucks example, what if that person bought his coins from coinbase or the person he got them from... then they can track him or her down and make them give you up.  
What you'd want to do is send those coins through a mixer or another service to "wash" them.  Then access them through tor etc. Then that's pretty damn anonymous.  
For cash it's hard to use without being in person.  Possible, but more difficult.

Absolute not.  Most people think bitcoin is secure cause blockchain.  The reality is Bitcoin is secure cause work.  Blockchain is merely the method of storage which facilitates independent verification of the data.   
You can't trust a blockchain unless you trust the consensus mechanism.  If you believe in physics you can trust Bitcoin.  If you trust the team behind an altcoin then that's fine maybe it's on a scale where you trust it to a certain point you're comfortable with as an investment.  
There is no use case for privately controlled currency.  There is too much risk.  No altcoin competes with Bitcoin in this regard.  
There can be country controlled crypto or private currency controlled by a Nation state like we have now with fiat just with a different model.
Again this isn't competition to Bitcoin

Why not deny the claims?  Because MtGox has real shit to do and it's unprofessional to acknowledge internet trolls.  Give them until Thursday and we'll see what is what.

You're an idiot and you have absolutely no fucking idea what you're talking about.  Aside from being factually wrong.  Even your fucking sentence isn't even a cohesive rational thought.  Democracy is a fucking retarded shitty system built upon logic an idiot like you would love to use.  Argumentum ad populum it's a logical fallacy.. one of several that is quite tightly tied up in our government.  Not to mention this country is nothing of what it was supposed to be.  Where is the Constitutional amendment banning drugs?  What gave the government to tell me what I can and can't do with my own body and build up a military within the united states call it a police force then threaten me on it.  I don't even do drugs, nor want to.  However if they needed an Amendment to ban alcohol where is it for weed and other drugs? All the people I murder while simply trying to make a reasonable living for myself.  While simple fucks like you have a circle jerk about your freedom and how great democracy is thinking happy happy thoughts.  
You'll notice I haven't explained why you're factually wrong.  This is an opportunity for you to go to google.com and research something you have no fucking clue.  So that next time you speak to me I can maybe possibly recognize you as a human being worthy of life.

Bitcoin is a protocol for distributed consensus.
It use to be that tx would be rejected spending the same utxo inputs.  Probably still is unless RBF or CPFP.
Thing is anyone can change their own implementation.  If a miner gets the 2nd tx they can include it in a block.  This isn't a double spend because the first tx would be rejected by the network after the 2nd is confirmed.
So you need to wait for it to be in a block.
There can be small chain splits so the larger the tx the more confirmations you want.
Yes it is possible for a tx in the mempool to be forgotten by the network.  This is why rebroadcasting is good.

Dear fire coins network users:

Second, the Bank:            1) the current industry, agriculture, construction, move the line of fire of four coins CAPE households Branch in the last three months have not received the relevant notification;            2) the statement on April 15 that they are also from the media the obtained;            3) At present, they are unable to determine the authenticity of the message.            The above are the current information gathering network to fire coins, which are the first-hand information, and the only objective description, without any inference and speculation. Information and other platforms have been announced net currency resulting fire information obtained is not entirely consistent, probably because of the different geographical and service providers caused, as to why the different services in different regions have different policies Chamber of Commerce, is not known.

At this point it is stupid to mine anything with CPU's except a couple of coins.  It's insanely stupid to mine BTC with a CPU.  
A good GPU offer's 2 orders of magnitude increase in performance/efficiency over CPUs and ASIC's the current method offers 2 orders (maybe 3 coming soon) of magnitude increase in performance/efficiency over GPUs. 
I believe mining bitcoin with a CPU would likely given you fractions of a penny over the term of several months. I'm not sure if your work would realistically even be accepted by a pool.  If you were to take the difference in cost in terms of electricity and play the lottery you'd have a substantially greater ROI.

So 5 or 6 well respected companies have came out and said Mt.Gox is insolvent. The document was confirmed to be more or less legitimate. 
So... this means one of 4 things happened.  Maybe there are more scenarios but I don't have more time to think about them.
1. Mt.Gox made a play with their money/coins to make more money/coins and failed.  Meaning they were hugely irresponsible with their holdings.  Undeserving of your support fund.  You don't give money to a crack addict compulsive gambler.
2.  Mt.Gox got a straight up jack from their wallets due to some bug.  If their coins were truly in cold storage this could not have happened.  This means they lied and are undeserving of any assistance from the BTC community.
3.  Mt.Gox didn't bother to do basic accounting on their holdings in cold storage and their hot wallets for years.  They couldn't fix it by gambling and now they are SOL.  Also this level of incompetence cannot be allowed to live.  No funds to support them.
4.  This is all bull shit and Gox still has the coins in cold storage and they are having trouble with the private key.  In which case your assistance really isn't needed. 
@_date: 2014-02-12 19:42:20
So Good.. but not perfect.  When you generate a private key use bip38 encryption. Then it honestly doesn't matter if you print it or not.  The whole point is now someone can get a hold of the piece of paper which contains your private key and it is completely worthless to them without your secure pass phrase.

Ethereum honestly is not a blue chip.  They gave that possibility up with the DAO.  It was sold as mining with AWS... it's not that.  It's an entire eco system dependent on one chain and the hope lies with vaporware on provably and proven fundamentally flawed theory (proof of stake).
The only creative interesting thing built on Ethereum was cryptokitties, and there is no reason why it couldn't have been it's own coin.
Seriously now that Bitcoin has lightning this idea of one chain to rule them all is stupid. When the shit ERC20 tokens die they are left on the blockchain forever.  
"stock" tokens should be their own coins.  They can interact with Bitcoin.  They can setup different centralized mechanisms etc.  This way when their incompetent devs fuck up they can fix it without begging to Vitalik to reveal once again why Satoshi stepping away was so important.

Also for mining I would consider something like this.
Miners verify that transactions are legitimate.  They make sure that you aren't sending more bitcoins than you have in your wallet.  Also because bitcoin is a decentralized system theoretically Bob could pay Sue and then use the same bitcoins to pay Jack kind of like how you can send the same email to more than one person. 
To prevent this miners have to find a key.  The miners try millons even billions of keys per second until they find the right one.  Then they can write to the ledger all of the valid transactions.  Other miners will see that the key has been found and the ledger has been updated.  They will see the ledger (or blockchain in bitcoin terms) has been updated and verify there are no invalid transactions written in the new entry in the ledger or block.  Once 51% of the miners agree that the block as solved and has no invalid transactions the miner who found the key is rewarded 25 bitcoins and at 600 dollars each that's a good chunk of change.  This new addition to the ledger becomes the next problem the miners have to solve and they will begin to work on finding the next key.  If a miner attempts to break the protocol by allowing invalid transactions the other miners will not be verify the block and the miner will have missed out on a pretty nice reward for trying to cheat the system. 
If miner A and miner B both find the key at the same time the result would be two different problems for the network to solve in order to write the next entry into the system.  Some miners would work on problem A and some would work on problem B.  Which ever resulting problem is solved first would determine if Miner A gets the reward or if Miner B gets the reward.  The reward that isn't solved is orphaned and then the entire network would be back to working on the ledger with the most entries. 
Now if you're thinking about going home and having your computer make you rich.  Consider that even really high end gaming computers might only produce 1 billion keys per second.  While the network is currently producing  34 million times the amount of keys your computer could produce.  Yes that is nearly 34 quadrillion keys per second are tried world wide to try and get the next reward.  There are special computers that can produce keys faster called ASICs, but the big ones are pretty expensive and you typically are better off simply buying bitcoin.  Furthermore most miners even the big guys work in pools.  Like pooling together to win the lottery. Then when the pool solves a block the reward is split up amongst the group according to how much work they contributed.

Basically they just break your btc balance into a many many smaller wallets send them here send them there and assemble them later or give you access to them in a few different wallets.  It's a PIA to trace, but I'd imagine a computer could go through the blockchain easily and track it.  The thing is plausible deniable.

Well they aren't.  Bitcoin is often considered a currency, but really it's many things and arguably it's not a currency.  Bitcoin is an online ledger which tracks these units of bitcoins to addresses.  People desire having these units being associated with addresses they control.  People get bitcoins from exchanges and through mining.  Yes there are plenty of bitcoin related business that are scams and because bitcoin's regulation is free market regulation it's reliant upon civil suits and trust.  There are several bitcoin companies that still embody a lot of trust with the bitcoin community.  If you're going to send your money to a site you should do some research on them to make sure they are legit.  
So right now bitcoins aren't being used to price items for most companies.  Most companies who accept bitcoins use it only as a payment mechanism and go directly to fiat.  Bitcoin is still young.  It has a lot of growing up to do before we see any sort of price stability.

The whole hacker mindset is about figuring out how things work and sharing that information with the world.
I was raised to believe that if there was no government there would be no money, no roads, no schools.  The more I have reflected on this topic and learned I realize that these are lies. 
Bitcoin is a thorn in the paw of government.  It breaks that paradigm of government needing to provide and control money.  It gets people thinking about government..it's role in in their daily lives and whether or not that's good for them.  That's bad for government.  
3D printing well short term it dramatically reduces R&amp;D costs.  It decentralizes manufacturing of certain goods.  Fuck just in time inventory... how about you just download the waterbottle you just bought the design for. Complete paradigm shift for getting customer's goods.  
Guns.  For all the problems that America has with firearm violence.  Which I believe can mostly be solved by simply legalizing drugs.  For all those problems... we had an awful lot of armed protests last year.  Not a single shot fired.  Not a single drop of blood spilled in anger.  
Think of Ukraine and Venezuela in 2025.  Will their governments shut up and respect the people's natural right of expression?  I think it's very likely that both sides being armed government and the people pushes each party to seek peaceful resolution than resorting to violence.  It's too easy for a government to foolishly enact violence upon their people to maintain order sparking a revolt.  If people are armed the government would have a clear tangible truth .. that if they enact violence it will be met with violent resistance and they will take a loss. The people will know that if they initiate violence against the government ... without first suffering that complete slaughter of innocent life.  That they will not gain enough support no matter how noble the cause.. the sin of initiating violence will not be forgiven and the cause will be lost.  Leading to the most probable conclusion a peaceful resolution.  
Is it 100% guaranteed.  No.   Just look at our own civil war.  However, I believe if you factor in the fact that even those amongst us who would be considered poor (in the United States) have access to luxuries that not even kings had access too 200 years ago.  Like cars, planes, running water, cheap access to the greatest collection of knowledge humanity has ever seen.  I can't for see a massive outbreak of violence... the decision among many many people to throw that all away and suffer the terrible losses we witnessed during the civil war over really truly trying to change society through more peaceful means like Martin Luther King Jr. did.

Bitcoin is awesome for a number of reasons.  Here are threw.  First yes many people have made small fortunes off of bitcoin in a short period of time.  Secondly and more importantly Bitcoin solves a computer science problem of how do you get consensus across a network where anyone can participate.  Good and bad actors alike. Lastly Bitcoin appeals to those amongst us who have a strong dislike for government money and banks.  I can potentially send millions of dollars to someone on the other side of the world in 10 minutes.  A real transfer of value not a transfer of a promise of value which depends on trust on many third parties.  Lets take fiat for example.  If I were to send money from the US to Germany I could do a wire transfer but realistically that money wont be there for weeks.  I'm trusting that no piece of the chain setup will break losing my money over the course of that week and initiate a charge back of some kind.  With Bitcoin you get your promise of payment in seconds just like with wire transfers, but you get the transfer of value in roughly 10 minutes.  After roughly 60 minutes the transfer of value becomes increasingly protected.  
Bitcoins exist only on the internet.  Millions of people have the blockchain backed up on their computers across the entire world.  Statistically speaking that's about as secure as you can get.  Your responsibility is to secure your private keys which control the addresses that store your bitcoins.  This isn't going to be as secure and this is where you might lose money.  To fix this you can print paper wallets which take the addresses offline and enable you to secure them with physical security rather than cyber security (which is notably less secure).  You can print these wallets out (with bitp38 encryption) and save them in your safe.. at your bank.  Send them to a friend across the country for safe keeping.  If anyone were to get access to your paper wallets they wouldn't be able to use them unless they had your passphrase.

Thanks for making my point and simultaneously proving you're an absolute moron. 
The Zimmerman trial was decided because Trayvon was placed on top of Zimmerman in a ground and pound position by an eye witness AND that the prosecution's star witness said she thought Trayvon started the fight (which technically is irrelevant according to Florida law because apparently you can start a fist fight and then if your life is put in danger use a firearm to defend yourself.)
Stand your ground wasn't part of the defense because the eye witness placed Zimmerman in a place where he couldn't possibly retreat. 
The fact of the matter is Zimmerman was found guilty in the court of public opinion long before he was even brought up on charges.  Originally the prosecutor and the police weren't even going to charge him because all the evidence supported self defense.  Furthermore it wasn't until Jesse Jackson and friends did a national media blitz with Trayvon's picture from when he was 13.  
Now your conjecture that he was a defenseless teen just proves how fucking monumentally stupid you are.   Please consider killing yourself and any offspring you may have produced so that your stupidity doesn't infect the human race anymore.  
When I was 17 I could kick the ever loving shit out of a grown ass man.  It's called 4 years of lifting for football and lacrosse.  Not to mention there were plenty of kids my age who could kick my ass... it's called wrestling.  
Teens do horrible things fairly regularly.  
Whether Trayvon was armed or not was irrelevant.  The only thing that mattered was did Zimmerman have a reasonable fear for his life.  The defense made that case and he was found innocent.  He will forever be guilty in the eyes of the public

1. We're not talking about bitcoin.  We're talking about doge
2. It's really pathetic to answer a question with a question which is entirely irrelevant and off topic.  If it was profound and actually made a brilliant point in an abstract way.. okay... but that's not the case here.  
3. People are only getting into doge for the potential profits.  Maybe it has a decent market cap.. but it's liquidity is shit.  Sure it's brand new, but it has a long way to go before building the fundamentals that bitcoin has. 
4.  An inflationary currency has merit in paying salaries, but for buying items its utility over a deflationary currency is marginal at best.  Tech is a perfect example.  Why do people buy TVs when they know in 6 months they can get the same TV cheaper or one that is better for the same price?  How is doge going to compete with fiat when the entire point of fiat is that it is owned by the government for the purposes of paying taxes.  Who is going to peg their salary to an inflationary cryptocoin?
5.  Why ARE people spending bitcoin?  It's a phenomenal payment mechanism because of the fundamentals behind it.  A very powerful payment network, a high market cap with a liquidity which permits the purchase of TVs, high end electronics, high end cars.. hell even property.   What can you reasonably buy with doge?  A pizza?  Well that's where bitcoin got it's start... but how is doge going to continue on when people realize that mining a shitton of doge isn't ever going to be profitable?  Why would you mine it when you can mine something more profitable and simply buy doge?  People mine bitcoin because they believe in crypto and eventually it will be profitable.  What is the mindset of doge miners?  Mine a little bit to be profitable?  
6.  Doge hasn't even seen shit in terms of real usage.  It's literally a joke.  If Doge starts to see real usage the price will genuinely rise .. and it's in the same boat as bitcoin.  Bitcoin is hyperdeflationary right now because it's growing. It's gaining adoption.  If BTC was used for 1% of the worlds GDP then each bitcoin would be worth like 100k.  It's got a long ways to go. If BTC was just 10% of the US GDP each coin would be worth about 125k.  
Spending bitcoin is a healthy investment.  Like mining, while you may realize a btc loss, the long term potential of supporting your investment will outweigh those losses handsomely.   I both mine and spend bitcoin and love doing it.

I'm not patronizing you it's not my style.  If I wasn't trying to be helpful I would be berating you, but this is not the case.  
The truth is I don't understand the math behind SHA-2, so I can't explain to you precisely how it works.  I do understand how hashing works in general and that's what I'd like to try to explain to you, because that's all you need to know to understand how the rest of the protocol works. 
Here is a fairly technical explanation of the SHA algorithm 
So when you create your bitcoin address you get 2 keys.  A public key and a private key.  When you sign a message with your private key it creates a hash.
Here is a public key 
and here is the private key for that public key
If I go here 
I can sign a message 
Here is an example
-----BEGIN BITCOIN SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hello Borax
-----BEGIN SIGNATURE-----
-----END BITCOIN SIGNED MESSAGE-----
You can verify the message here 
If you change any of the values in the message it will not verify.  Basically when you put the hash
and the message
Hello Borax
into the verification function the output will be the public key 1CLnCrjws1cBB9peTKsnAcFn29qQ2Qgk6u
If the output is anything but the public key you know that the message isn’t valid.  Either it was damaged in transport or tampered with in some way.  
So when you broadcast a transaction you’re basically sending a message 
Move .003 BTC FROM 1CLnCrjws1cBB9peTKsnAcFn29qQ2Qgk6u to 17LxZrtE3tweTsf4ibbcTxS4EMTJieFBhk  PayMiners .001 BTC
-----BEGIN BITCOIN SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Move .003 BTC FROM 1CLnCrjws1cBB9peTKsnAcFn29qQ2Qgk6u to 17LxZrtE3tweTsf4ibbcTxS4EMTJieFBhk  PayMiners .001 BTC
-----BEGIN SIGNATURE-----
-----END BITCOIN SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Now a miner can look at the message and then verify that 1CLnCrjws1cBB9peTKsnAcFn29qQ2Qgk6u has the bitcoins that 17LxZrtE3tweTsf4ibbcTxS4EMTJieFBhk is a valid address.
Miners will want to include this transaction into the block they sign because they will get the fee in addition to the block reward which is currently 25 BTC.  
@_date: 2014-02-26 16:40:13
So first we're talking about how to determine whether or not Bitcoin is a failure.  Not if it is successful.  These are subjective opinions of a state which need to be defined and measured.  Then "being successful" simply means meeting the criteria of being successful and this doesn't dictate future events.  
So ponzi schemes are typically successful with the criteria of people making money.  In the beginning all the way up until it collapses.  Then it is a failure by the criteria of the extreme majority of users have lost most or all of their money and the ponzi scheme is no longer functioning. 
This is not the case with Bitcoin and recent events.  The exchanges have little to do with Bitcoin itself.  People who bought bitcoin and held on to it from this point last year until now (for a total time period of one year) are still sitting quite nicely.  Bitcoin the protocol is still working.  More and more people are still adopting Bitcoin into their day to day lives.  
So classifying Bitcoin as a failure at this point I believe is a bit premature.  Saying that Bitcoin is an unstoppable force that cannot be slowed down or stopped I think we have evidence that Bitcoin cannot grow logarithmically in adoption indefinitely without taking a few steps back.  This is by using price as the measurement of adoption.  Perhaps this is more of a reflection of the fallacy of using price as a measurement tool of adoption rather than an indication that Bitcoin is really suffering right now.

Ok first you need to understand public key encryption.  If you and i exchange public keys then we can send eachother messages.   When i send a message to you ill run it through a hashing function (like a math function) with my private key as a variable in said function.  The result will be my signature that i will then send along to you with my message.  You'll take my public key and run it through another function with my message and signature as variables and the result should be my public key.  If it is you've just verified that you have a genuine message from me completely unaltered.
So when Bob signs a transaction the Miner's can verify the transaction really came from him!
With the signature function it uses the private key as a variable.  Without that variable there is no way to reproduce that result with the message input.  You can't use algebra and get the variable you need to guess and the odds are one in an insanely large number like 1 in as many atoms as there are in the milky way galaxy

I don't think you really understand how computers work.  My I7 8 core CPU mines at like 35 mhs. There is so much overhead involved in the OS.  You could get some performance gains by making a "mining OS", but realistically you're not talking that much.  Oh the other hand my Jupiter mines at 550ghs... that's several orders of magnitude.  That's not a mundane detail Michael.  That means to match the hashing power of my ASIC you need like 16000 CPUs.  I mean come on.... think of how much power that is?  
Why?  Well computers have different levels of memory.  Hard drive, ram, cache, registers ... each is faster than its predecessor.  The CPU is built to execute instructions which allows it to do anything the programmer can throw at it.  This is versatility. Now when you compile a program and run it... you are running it with overhead of the OS and other applications on the system. The level of indirection in terms of executing the algorithm indirectly rather than explicitly with hardware is costly.  What an ASIC allows you to do is take the most difficult parts of the algorithm and break them down further into their base logical units.  It's the difference between taking public trans to get from A-B and taking a car on a straight empty road to get there. 
Any increase in technology utilized by making the CPU can be leveraged in the ASIC.  So... CPUs will never catch up. 
So there isn't a "mining resistant" algorithm.  If you can express it in code you can express it in circuits and it's going to be a fuck ton faster.  It's best we focus on "mining" algorithms that provide real value to the world.  Like proof of resources.

It's a SCRYPT ASIC... I don't think it makes sense to have an ASIC that can go back and forth.  300KH/s with 7 watts of power... so meaning you can comfortably hit 30MH with a 1000 watt system. 
@_date: 2014-04-02 18:44:47
I'd spend it on hiring an ASIC engineer with proven experience and try to mass produce your own ASICs.  250K is probably enough to get started.  Just to be clear the engineer doesn't cost 250k.. but his services + the manufacturing of the ASIC you need a nice chunk of change. 
That being said... still really risky business.

You sound like a reporter.  Both in some of the phrasing of the sentences as well as your complete misunderstanding of the subject matter.  
I don't see how a transaction id would affect anything.  Data can't affect things.  Again this question doesn't really make a whole lot of sense.  
Some of the other exchanges had the same bug in their wallets too.   Most of them have fixed them already.  I think MtGox is simply testing this the most because they have been hit by this attack the most and all eyes are on them so to speak.   Delaying things a few days and being absolutely sure everything is good is far better and much more professional than rushing an untested fix out there which would make things far worse. 
Yes, it sounds like you have a good security setup for your bitcoins.  FYI You don't need to turn your wallet on to send bitcoins to yourself from coinbase.  You just need to have your address.  You just need to turn your computer on to send coins.

I think you're better off going with the r9290x.  
1.  SHA has fallen out of favor with the alt coins. Scrypt is currently where it's at because so many people have invested in GPU's and they are worthless for Bitcoin mining.  SHA alt-coins will eventually be dominated by lower end ASICs and there isn't much opportunity there but look into it yourself and see if you agree. 
2.  BTC difficulty has a ways to go before it begins to really level off.  
3.  There is another market for GPUs ... GAMERS!  Worse come to worst and the crypto experiment ends you can still sell your video cards to gamers to recoup some of your investment.
4. If Scrypt ASICs do come out there is a possibility of Altcoins making the algorithm slightly different rendering them useless.  This is unverified speculation but I believe it is possible.  As I am not a computer engineer and we haven't seen any ASIC's for scrypt developed yet this could be false.  However even if ASIC's for scrypt come out I am sure that another proof of work algorithm will come out that will become wildly popular for Alt coins and GPU mining for the same reasons that litecoin became popular.

Furthermore, if a dev were to release something, or maybe roll something back, and 51% of the people wanted it and 49% wouldn't budge, you'd get a fork.

So these fucking morons think 2FA is OTP ... ugh.  2FA is a wide range of things all it means is a 2nd layer of authentication. 
SMS verification at face value seems dumb, but actually you could pull it off simply with emails for the most part.  This however is silly from the perceptive that now your email and/or telephone number is in plaintext in the blockchain for anyone to download.  
Bip38 essentially is 2FA.  You get to put a password along with your address... it's pretty good.  
As for storing a password in the blockchain.  That would be kind of cool.. but then you'd have to have 2 keys... blockchain would potentially be bloated.  I don't see this offering any advantages over BIP38. 
I honestly don't see any of this bringing any value to the adoption of BTC... Bip38 is really all that's needed.  It's was a fun mental exercise though.. so thanks for that.

So when I said that GPU's are ASICs it wasn't my opinion, it was something that I read a couple of different places.  Now I'm not a computer engineer so I very well could be wrong.
Basically what I read was an ASIC is a chip that is more specialized to do a certain type of operation more efficiently than your regular CPUs.  So a CPU is basically designed to be very flexible with a full Assembly language implementation.  The idea I read of how to think of ASICs is a chip that helps the CPU.. the CPU will offload certain operations to this type of chip because it can do it much faster because it's specifically designed to do that operation.  For example an ALU.
So a GPU is a Graphical Processing Unit and graphical calculations specifically floating point operations get offloaded to the GPU to get performed much faster than the CPU can actually do them.  So going with that definition of ASIC i can see how a GPU would be considered an ASIC.
Conversely I can also see why back in maybe 2000 a GPU was truly an ASIC where as today the graphics cards do so much more that they perhaps no longer qualify as ASICs, but I don't think you'd see people running operating systems on GPUs.  Now Everything a GPU can do a CPU can do but slower.. but the inverse is possibly not true?  At the very least there are a lot of things a CPU be programmed to do far easier than an ASIC.
I certainly agree that doing a scrypt ASIC chip can be a very daunting task.  However I think it's important to consider that there are ASICs on wallstreet that cost millions of dollars that execute trading algorithms far more complicated than scrypt so it can be done.
It's not so much that the engineers working on a scrypt ASIC have to out perform the AMD engineers, its that the intent is more specific and therefore they are going directly to the solution rather than approaching the problem indirectly.  Scrypt was originally being done with CPUs before someone kicked out the GPU implementation.  The GPU implementation came out because people saw the benefits that it brought to SHA coins.
Basically the shift that happened with bitcoin is originally it was CPU to GPU.. it was a massive shift and the CPU guys got left in the dust holding a lot of baggage.  Then Scypt came along and it was suppose to be GPU resistant.. and then the GPU guys took over that too.  Then bitcoin got into ASICs and all the big time GPU miners were like well wtf then they started mining the shit out of LTC and the other scrypt coins.. which is why I say ASICs for scrypt are coming probably some time this year and it will lead to another algorithm to get back into the cpu-&gt; gpu cycle or maybe just straight to GPU.
I strongly considered getting in early on the scrypt ASIC, but ultimately decided against it because there is so much that can go wrong with developing that kind of technology especially when days matter so much.

Alright you ignorant fuck.  The Netherlands... Part of the EU... Which uses the ECB.. Meaning that provided your country's central bank is indeed a publicly owned institution ... which many central banks are not publicly owned and therefore not even remotely under the control of the democracy.  This means you get to send a representative to the ECB.
So your democracy is indirectly in control of a board which is indirectly in control of a very small portion of your monetary currency.  The rest of it is controlled by either other countries with the same format.. or other countries with private central banks where the democracy has absolutely no control over their central bank.. like in the US.
And lets talk about THIS COUNTRY which spends trillions of dollars every year securing western interests (yes dumb shit that means you) around the world.

Yeah so I have a comp sci degree too and litecoin was suppose to be GPU resistant too and we all know where the CPU miners went.  
Comp sci is not computer engineering I took a great sysarch class and made a CLA fun stuff, but I'm no computer engineer... and I'm pretty confident you aren't either.  
A GPU is considered by many to be an ASIC.  
So until a computer engineer with chip making experience weighs in I'm holding that Scrypt ASICs are totally doable.  
The big win with ASICs and why they are a big deal isn't that they will completely eclipse GPUS... the first bitcoin ASICS didn't flat out compete with some of the big GPU mining ops.  
The big win with ASICs is energy efficiency... and not from the perspective of profitability, but scale.  If you can pack 25MHs in a box for 1200 watts... People can run a few of those in their home.  Compare that to a 5MH machine running 1200W.. 
ASIC development is a fundamental contributor to a coin's success.  If companies and people are investing in specialized hardware that's a pretty big +1 for it's growth and adoption.
Another algorithm will come about and cycle rinse repeat.

So 1 bitcoins are safer in someways and more dangerous in others.
If you take the required steps for security you're far safer with btc in terms of someone stealing them from you.  Your personal identity can be much more secure and if you want for online transactions you can remain anon.  There is simply a tech hurdle here which will come down eventually.
A few months well the price should have had a healthy boost for you and now if you send btc somewhere some companies will give you a discount for using btc.  Also after you have btc the transaction fees are lower.  
What you said is stupid.  Its like saying USD is being cheaper because of lower taxes then criticizing it because you have to pay 5% to convert your euros.
I'm not familiar with euros and sepa but are sepa transactions reversible?  A bitcoin transaction is a transfer of value like me handing you cash ir gold.  So 10 minutes for a transfer of value is really good.

That's very interesting.  I didn't have much time to look into it, but I still don't see how it's going to be effective.  Do you have any more technical links?  I like videos, but a paper would be good too. I understand how Bitcoin works and how the network achieves consensus.  I don't understand however you can achieve consensus for such a versatile system and have it scale.

So 2FA is to prevent individual's being hacked.  If a hacker can compromise the exchange then why would they bother with disabling 2FA all they need to do is steal the bitcoins.  
Hacking individual's computers through malware and other attacks is much easier than attacking an exchange.

Fuck you if you buy from BFL.  Donating to keep that company alive is a black eye to the entire bitcoin community.  You're only going to make a fraction of your investment back and you'll have to wait for another btc boom to ROI in fiat. 
There are rare opportunities to have a chance of entering bitcoin mining profitably.  They are risky, rare, and when they do come brief.  The purchase window is only a few days.  Also expensive.  KNC is the place to go to but only if you're first inline for a next gen

Yup.. currently I plan on trading with btce.. but literally moving my coins in there in whatever alt coins I happen to be trading at the time .. specifically to make a trade. 
@_date: 2014-07-15 21:39:28
So coinbase isn't an exchange.   It's a market place.   It sounds like what you want is an exchange like bitstamp or btce.  
Coinbase serves a different purpose.  Coinbase integrats with your bank account to buy and sell bitcoin.   In my experience it works very well.   They serve to allow new people enter bitcoin in an easy manner and to allow shoppers to use bitcoin as a payment mechanism.   
So like a store.  When you buy bitcoin you expect a uniform price coinbase does that. With an exchange you're always going to get market price.   You can set a limit but its still market price. 
@_date: 2014-02-18 17:24:31

@_date: 2014-02-20 22:31:08
You're right.  MtGox isn't currently an exchange where you can buy and sell bitcoins.  You cannot get your purchase so therefore you cannot buy bitcoins there and they cannot be sold by definition. 
@_date: 2014-03-01 00:32:44
A bitcoin is worth exactly one bitcoin... or 1000 mbtc.  This doesn't really change too often so I don't think anyone has really thought to put it up. 
@_date: 2014-02-10 07:42:58
So having a web wallet is considered amongst the worst places to keep your coins long term.  Arguably your phone can challenge web wallets on top of that.
However... that being said.. i still think having your coins on a regular computer that you use day in and day out is a terrible idea.  OSX is more secure than Windows, and I use it myself.. however everything I do that isn't on paper wallets is on separate computers running linux with an encrypted file system.
Now if you're going to do cold/offline that's the best especially when you're using bip38.  You can simply watch your addresses from your local machine on blockchain info.

There is this really cool think called glancing and skimming.  You should really look into it. See people can scan reddit and omit keywords that don't interest them.  It really shouldn't take more than a fraction of a second or even be noticeable really to not identify comments and threads that don't interest you.  Sure you might miss a post here and there, but it's okay.  
If the amount of time you're investing in "reading" these uninteresting pieces of content frustrates you... perhaps you have an anger management issue that you should look into.  Or maybe you should look into improving your skimming ability.  
When something that starts off with "such profit" etc. etc. or you see doge.. simple stop reading it.  It works wonders I swear.  In fact I'm willing to bet that's what most users of reddit do.  I don't understand how you could live without scanning/skimming/glances on reddit.  I would imagine that it would be completely debilitating reading every thread and comment, and prevent you from functioning as a normal human being entirely.

So technically to answer your question.  There is no such thing as a bitcoin address that does not exist.  All addresses are just numbers.  So in a way the question you've asked doesn't really make sense.  
I would phrase your question more like this.  What would happen if someone sent bitcoin to an address that no one controls.  In otherwords the coins were sent to an address where the private key isn't known to anyone.
The answer is the coins will sit there until they are moved via a transaction signed by the private key.  The private key would have to be found.  Statistically this is impossible.  If it were possible then bitcoin's fundamental security base would be compromised and we'd need to upgrade the bitcoin security protocol.

It's rare to come across people who don't come across as fairly technical in this subreddit.  It's no big deal.
Reddit is a news/content agitator.   Basically people from all around the world will submit links or post questions or stories and other users will vote them up or vote them down and comment on the content.  
It's a great way to stay on top of current events, find funny and amusing content, and there are subreddits for specific topics like maybe a major city you're close too or a particular hobby that interests you there is probably a subreddit for it.  Some cities even do meetups (It's actually how I met my gf and we just celebrated our 2nd year anniversary)
Bitcoin is a ledger (called the blockchain) and the units of value are called "bitcoins" (small b).  It's backed up hundreds of thousands if not millions of times across the entire world.  What's so great about bitcoin is that all the backups of the ledger can be proven to be correct due to the effort of the mining network.  The mining network verifies transactions and writes them to the blockchain, as a reward they receive new bitcoins whenever they write a block.  Blocks are written roughly every 10 minutes and the reward is 25BTC currently.  Every 4 years the reward will be halved.  Bitcoins like gold are limited in supply and very difficult to get.  This is why they gain value.  
You use bitcoin buy downloading a wallet and making an address then having some Bitcoins sent to your address.  You can buy some from coinbase.com if you're American and send them.  I would strongly encourage you to research how to secure your bitcoins before diving in with any large purchases.  But if you want to buy a small about like 20 bucks worth it might be an excellent way to conduct your research.

For like a year Mtgox was supposed to launch LTC. This was supposed to make LTC jump to like 100 bucks. A lot of people were eagerly awaiting it... with MtGox now dead .. it seems like it will be a while before that happens if ever.  Even if it does it likely wont have the same appeal as before.  So with all this pent up anticipation people decided that Hubobi accepting LTC would be the opportunity to pump and dump it. 
Bitstamp users were probably unaware of this because they don't care about LTC and when BTC-e and Hubobi went down due to people loading up on ltc for the LTC release... bitstamp users were like what's going on.. and probably just followed along.

This is free market regulation.  This is an epic failure on Gox.  Cold storage means a manual process.  Funds don't simply come out of "cold storage" and get sent.  How do you not do something when you see .. Oh Hey my debits and credits don't add up.  From 10%... 20%... all the way down to 99%?  That's when you realize that your cold storage account is low?  It's not like you can't check the balance of your cold storage wallet at anytime just because the private keys are offline.  This isn't advanced math it's arithmetic. 
Karpels belongs in jail and/or have his wages garnished for the rest of his life until all his financial debts are met.  Along with any MtGox execs who knew this was going on.  
Why would you save a company who has failed so monumentally.  This is beyond incompetence it's malice.  MtGox needs to be cut off entirely from the bitcoin community.

For a non-technical explanation of Bitcoin you sort of lost me at "Protocol" and at TCP/IP forget GPS, I didn't even have a map. 
I'd simply say "Bitcoin is a payment network like Email is a messaging platform. 
Then I would say Bitcoin is a decentralized system.  This means it is resilient.  First we would do peer to peer file sharing with Napster which was based on a centralized system.  That was shutdown because all the government had to do was shutdown Napster.  However we can still use BitTorrent today because like Bitcoin it is a decentralized system and there isn't a single entity to shut down to stop the service.    
I'd also add fungibility to your list of features.  Maybe add to the utility about how much easier it is to move bitcoins than it is to move gold for example.

This is attractive to us.  Western Union doesn't give a shit.  They care about market cap.
Western union is all about fiat transfer.  They need liquidity.  
Dollars in and dollars out.  If ltc was as liquid ad btc they could use it.  Just because one ltc is cheaper than one btc it just means you have to send more ltc to transfer 100 usd or to put it another way you would buy less btc so it's equal in that respect.
Network security is nice for sure but liquidity is essential.

So what the man did was extraordinarily stupid. We have seen it time and time again.  Stupid people don't hold on to bitcoins for very long.  They come on.. they share their stories and like natural selection they either leave the bitcoin community or adapt and become smarter.  Now the guy knows to go to a bank.
People do all sorts of stupid shit.  If he was selling gold and got robbed it's the same deal.  There is no reversing the transactions with gold or cash either.  Really your point here is quite silly.  He wouldn't receive any compensation if he sold anything else of value and was stupid about it.. unless he had insurance on it which ... isn't provided by government.  
As for the gentleman who wants to sue someone.  Arbitration is hardly something that requires a centralized authority to pursue.  However given that at least in the United States and most western countries there is a monopoly on the market ... it's tough for these markets to really emerge to the forefront of our lives.  They do still exist for civil disputes, and could exist for violent acts of aggression as well, but the monopoly which is implemented and supported through violence prevents that market from developing.

I haven't used either as a merchant.  Coinbase seems to be more public about their security and I believe they have a lot of venture cap money behind them.  This could just be better PR on that front for Coinbase.
I once had a problem with Bitpay and it was resolved by them really quickly and I was very happy.  It was also dealing with a substantial amount of money. I suppose it was ironic in a way that I sent the money from my coinbase account.  Basically I transferred money into coinbase to consolidate it and then tried to make the payment a before coinbase could verify all my deposits.  Everything went through okay though no complaints.
I believe the guy who created litecoin works for coinbase now so that would be a plus in the tech department.

So gold has value because it can be used in electronics, jewelry, and it's rare. 
Schiff agrees that bitcoins are rare.  Great.  
However he doesn't see any value in a decentralized network managing transactions which is owned by no one?  The reason he shits on dollars is specifically because there is so much printing of money.  Why? Because the fed owns the dollar and can do whatever they want with it.  That can't happen with bitcoin.  Furthermore billions if not trillions of dollars are made each year simply by managing transactions.  Bitcoin does this faster and cheaper.  That's valuable.  
@_date: 2014-01-20 18:57:37
This is normal.  After a big burst btc gets really exciting..  Think of it like going skydiving then driving the speed limit home.
What happens is.  Btc gets an influx of new users which drives the price up but they are skiddish because its so new and considered risky.  They get burned with a few crashes and the vets scoop up cheap coins and btc finds real support way higher than TA people expect.  
The moving average needs to come meet the price point since the overly bullish btc market wont go meet the price.  With the real support sured up it will begin rapid expansion grab media attention explode.  Grab government attention crash. Rinse cycle repeat... Process takes 6-7 mos

Bitcoin sees the same fucking bull shit we see in other "regulated" markets.  On bitcoin the market moves faster, when there are problems less people get fucked, and the gov doesn't get their cut in terms of orchestrating these boom bust cycles.

Bitcoin is still new and for it to really take off it's market cap needs to grow quite a bit.  This means we're going to have to have at least a few more "bubbles" where we run up and high.
We just need to accept where bitcoin is today... and that means it's still an excellent payment network.  
When Bitcoin is bought at a low price I see it as bitcoins being transferred to strong hands or people who believe more in bitcoin from weak hands people who don't really believe in it yet.  This is good because eventually the weak hands will be forced to buy BTC at a higher price and convert weak hands into strong hands.

People have theoretical free market solutions to the types of scams like BFL.  Of course given the government's monopoly on conflict resolution it makes it impossible to see if these solutions are viable.

It's a very emotionally charged market.  I'm one of the saps who has lost a lot in trading and that's okay as I at least did one thing right by not risking more than I was willing to lose.  However if the price drops more I'll keep buying all the way down to 0.  I'm not selling shit no more.

lol they used this "just discovered exploit" for years and it's part of their SOP to specifically corrupt open source projects by injecting subtle bugs into projects.  
Ridicule me all you want.  The NSA spying on pretty much everyone on the internet has been known for more than 10 years... and people like you ridiculed me until Snowden leaked some documents .. then all of a sudden it's some big surprise.  
I don't typically buy into conspiracy theories very often.  Usually I dismiss them.  Most of the time even if they were true and I could prove it they are worthless.  However this isn't even that far fetched.  We know the NSA tries to corrupt projects like Tor in PRECISELY this manner... sorry but given all the bull shit the US government does ... of this you'd have to provide me proof they didn't do it... but you can't prove a negative... so it might just be easier for you to go join them and find out that they did actually do this.

So let me get this straight.  This guy does something which is incredibly stupid on all accounts.  You call that "normal bitcoining" despite the fact that I have seen on this subreddit many many times people warning never meet people in person in a dark parking lot at night. They always recommend at least meeting at McDonalds or Starbucks.  For 5k I think everyone would agree that you meet at a bank.  
Then you want to make a 1 to 1 comparison between this guy... doing something that is incredibly stupid... to people using fiat financial tools correctly.  
Not to mention about 5 years ago plenty of people got scammed with the Nigerian prince thing.  The scammers sent a fake check.. the bank gave the mark the money. the mark sent the scammers the money via western union another normal fiat financial tool and when the check bounced the bank told the customer you're on the hook for sometimes tens of thousands of dollars.  FDIC didn't cover that.
This guy could have used Coinbase or simply met the guy in a bank.  Very simple procedures that most non-idiots would be fine with.  
Also because of the blockchain and the technology involved it likely wouldn't be difficult to find the robber and prove that he stole the bitcoins in a government provided court or if that wasn't a monopoly a private court so to speak.

Enough of this.. lets try to get libtards to vote with us by selecting a absolutely shitty candidate that everyone hates.  Play to your fucking strengths for Christ sake.  
I believe Romney lost the election because they cheated to avoid a vote at the convention.  That's when Romney was put into the I'd rather die than vote for that fuckass category.  It was extremely unlikely I'd vote for Romney anyway... but maybe I wouldn't have been so anti-romney.. and all libertarian leaning people don't lean all the way like I do (an-cap) So maybe they feared Obama enough to vote for Romney.. but the cheating likewise turned them to Johnson.

I'd strongly recommend following 's advice and using coinbase they are really great.
Bitcoins are by design non-reversible.  This approach puts the responsibility on the consumer to vet the people they do business with.

Thanks for the tip, StingLikeABeee answered your question better than I.  
Basically if he has the private key for 16oRXSdfYpUFjPq5B44Y7p3wGqEGAHo7Yq
he could take a message and sign it with his private key and tell us what the message is ... lets say the message is "Hello this is my key"
Then we can take "Hello this is my key" and 16oRXSdfYpUFjPq5B44Y7p3wGqEGAHo7Yq (his public key) and verify the message.  That would mean that in fact he has the private key for 16oRXSdfYpUFjPq5B44Y7p3wGqEGAHo7Yq 
It would add a bit of credibility to his claim, however I'm doubtful.

I don't give a shit if it's unlikely in your family it's retarded.  How many families are there who are all going to be developers?
In common use no one gives a shit about security and even if your family are all developers then .  Ever let anyone on your network.  If you're using Windows there have been exploits where simply having your computer on the same network as an infected computer would install the virus on the system.
Sure by all means make the app as secure as possible but the fact of the matter is you can never fix stupid.  Security needs to be taken seriously.  Perhaps an iso install with Ubuntu and mulitibit already installed would be a good step in the right direction.  Run the thing off a cd and save the file to multiple places etc.

It can't be done.  The miners would not go along with it and it would produce a useless fork.  It would undermine crypto currencies entirely.

I don't see what is hypocritical about this.  A lot of bitcoiners are libertarians who prefer free market approaches to dealing with these sorts of things rather than the use of force AKA government intervention.  
Now with a bank closing an account due to purchasing bitcoin.. Since this is a direct attack against the main premise of this subreddit I would expect to see a stronger outcry about it.. but still it would remain to bitching about it and boycotting that bank.  AKA take your business elsewhere.
With this I would imagine that a lot of bitcoiners are gun owners, but considering that bitcoin is a controversial subject as are firearms I think many of us gun owning bitcoiners can sympathize with a young company wanting to avoid as much undo media craze as possible. 
Is this enough to make some gun owning bitcoiners want to boycott BitPay... maybe and they are free to do so... but unless they directly attack firearms by lobbying or donating to the brady campaign I wont be one of them.

Create a paper wallet.  Select the BIP38 address.  Use a password you're going to remember.
Test the paper wallet with bitaddress.org "Wallet details"  it's not the most user friendly UI so take a look at it and make sure you see the 5J and that with your password the bip38 address looks good.  
Now if you're moderately or more tech savy you should strongly consider using ubuntu to make a offline paper wallet.  If you google "ubuntu offline paper wallet"  you should be able to pull up a tutorial to do it.  What you're looking for is something that allows you to boot into ubuntu (linux) with a CD or USB Drive. Such that there is no storage really available to store anything to (CD is better if it's available) 
Then you can keep your bitcoin paper wallet in a bank and at your home.  
Now what does this do for you.  First a tried and true saying in security is basically something like good security is not convenient.  This solution clearly isn't particularly convenient.. so what do you get with that effort?
Well AFAIK I have never heard of a piece of paper being hacked.  This means no matter what you do on your computer your bitcoins will remain secure.  In other words your bitcoin is now able to be protected physically.  We're much better with Physical security than we are with computer security. 
Now additionally if someone sees your paper wallet with the BIP38 address it wont mean anything to them.  If someone robs the bank or your home and steals your paper wallet then you just go to the other location pick up your wallet move the bitcoins and you're good.  If you flash your Bip38 address on TV no one is going to be able to steal your BTC in 30 seconds or at all provided you picked a good long secure password.  
You have to make damn sure you don't forget your password otherwise your BTC is gone.  If you want your family to get your BTC in the unfortunate event that something happens to you they will need it.  
AFAIK this is the gold standard of securing your bitcoins.  This is likely how the Winklevoss twins secure their millions of dollars worth of BTC.  
Other good alternatives are to use a dedicated computer which runs linux with a good wallet.  I like Bitcoin-QT but it's not very convenient.  Also you can use electrum, armory, or even multibit AFAIK these are all good choices.  Encrypt the harddrive on your dedicated machine and backup your wallet to another encrypted medium like a USB Key or something.  Encrypt your wallet.dat and there you go.  This might be a more reasonable method to use if you plan on trading your BTC now and then to try and make more.  
Do not whatever you do use an online wallet... I'd also strongly recommend treating any wallet on your phone like your real wallet.  In other words don't put more money on your phone than you'd normally be okay with losing. 
Also, anything you do online should be using 2FA and OTP authentication.  
Mind you I have used the AFAIK (As far as I know) acronym several times during this post.  Please do your due diligence and research these topics yourself and select the option best for you.  That being said if you go against my advice on not using an online wallet at all and you end up losing your bitcoins you'll have absolutely no sympathy from me.
Bonus Pro tip... In addition to using 2FA with Authy or google auth on Coinbase make sure you disable any API or apps on your phone.  There have been reports of people's coinbase accounts being compromised through this method.  You could easily find yourself screwed with any BTC you have in coinbase as well as anything the attacker was able to purchase instantly with your account.

Bitcoin isn't so much a program as it is a protocol.  So there was a bug in the source code of the wallet which affected several exchanges.  However the bitcoin protocol was reviewed by Gavin and other core developers and has still declared it to be sound.  
I just want to be clear in my communication with you.  So lets take email for example.  When you say "is it in the bitcoin source code"  is like saying "is it in the email source code"  It makes no sense.  
If the same thing were to happen in email.. my explanation would effectively be there was a bug found in Microsoft Outlook, and other email client's also suffered from the same mistake. 
@_date: 2014-01-04 14:04:08
It's not so much harmless, although you'd really have to arch that fucker in there and the dumbass doing it would likely exhaust his entire magazine before he figured that out.  So yeah... I guess in that case harmless... but if the shooter had a clue and lobbed the bullet in there it would do some damage... but the likelihood of getting decent shot placement is pretty damn tiny.
Basically you need 2 things for an effective round.  
1. You need a good caliber size.  Outside of .22LR pretty much any rifle is going to have a good amount of stopping power.
2.  You need shot placement.  You need to hit your target (unlikely with an AK at 400M) and on top of that it's gotta be a vital shot.  To the head or chest.  Otherwise there is a good chance you'll fail to stop the target.  So you'd never see a sniper take out a hostage taker at 400M with an AK47.

Maybe you or someone you know has a name similar to a drug dealer ... as a result your bank account gets frozen under false pretenses.  You're left with no access to your money to buy food or pay bills while the matter is being taken care of.
You have some money in Bitcoin that you can hit up LocalBitcoins with and get access to cash to buy some food pay your bills... OR maybe you can even go some places and pay for it with btc directly and potentially get a modest discount.  
Also, Bitcoin being young with a lot of room to grow you could see that small "rainy day" fund become quite large... or go to nothing... in which case it was only a rainy day fund.

Well he's denying reality.  The fact of the matter is coinbase and bitpay are both payment processors which facilitate payment between consumer and merchant and they both offer to completely shield both parties from price fluctuations. 
Overstock works with coinbase and you can get an instant price quote at the point of sale.  
Bitcoin is still very new and it has a small market cap.  
So to say Bitcoin isn't real, is silly.  Sure it has it's flaws, but it also has its advantages.  It's simply different.

Bitcoin is really new.  I'm not sure if Coinbase has insurance to try and cover any potential losses and what not, but I'm sure it will come eventually.  Insurance for major operations will likely take a while because they need to have a history of the likelihood of it happening.
I'm assuming you're American, because I would venture to say we're the only ones who have "faith in our dollar" because we're the world's reserve currency.  Every other currency with the exception of maybe the Euro has a serious risk of becoming worthless.  Fact is many people actually believe the US dollar will become worthless eventually.
A Bitcoin savings account or CD if you will is really easy to setup.  You just go to Bitaddress.org make an address with bip38 encryption and print it out.  To do this securely since you're a competent computer user consider using a ubuntu boot CD and disconnecting the computer from the internet when you have the webpage loaded.  
For checking accounts you have a few options.  Your phone is pretty convenient with something like coinbase.  It's a great solution, but you want to make sure you never put more money on your phone then you're willing to lose.  Think of it like carrying cash in your wallet.  
If you want to do a little trading then I recommend using a dedicated linux machine to hold your bitcoins.  Really use this machine for nothing other than bitcoin.  Also if you have a spare router set it up to run on a completely separate network.  
The idea behind Bitcoin is to replace the banks.  Banks have a long history of securing money and insuring it.  Bitcoin being so new doesn't have that completely implemented yet, but it's getting better everyday.
I think also hardware wallets have a lot of promise too.  They will make it much easier for less technical people to use Bitcoin safely and securely.

They claim zero conf is safe despite numerous successful double spends.
They hate on Bitcoin devs and steal a lot of their updates.

Is there any point to mining?  Yes, but not for you with that investment capital and hardware.  
Buy as much BTC as you're willing to loose.  If it goes up another 5000% in the next few years see if it is worth getting into mining then.
Even if it isn't directly profitable you're still contributing to the value of bitcoin so that will come back to you in one way or another in the long run.

No blocks no transactions Bitcoin doesn't work.
Huge blocks Bitcoin becomes centralized because then mining pools can only operate out of major data centers.  If a mining pool goes down some random across the world can't just magically spin one up in a few hours like can be done now.  
Bitcoin is supposed to be the TOR of money... the uncensorable money.  Moores law doesn't apply to TOR, wireless mesh networks, or satellite connections.
TOR is like the 2nd amendment.  Having the ability to go to TOR prevents attack from major governments.  
Wireless mesh nets and satellites can help, but the real benefit here is additional reliability in under developed areas. 
Empty blocks are being mined because that's the most effective way to run covert ASICBoost which Bitmain holds a patent too and effectively used to snuff out the mining competition for years.
@_date: 2019-11-22 12:42:05

So if I have a pizza the value of that pizza is that it can provide nutrients to people.  Now if I have 8 slices and 16 people ... Cutting each slice in half and feeding 16 people a half a slice of pizza isn't changing the amount of value the pizza has to offer.  The calories of the pizza are the same regardless if it's cut into 16 slices or 8 slices.

So with LN we would be signing transactions between each other until we close the channel on the bitcoin blockchain.
Or we could do it one way like the eclair wallet.  
You don't want to keep a lot of money on a LN channel because your private keys are kept on a device which is on the internet.  
LN is good for day to day purchases for amounts of money you'd be willing to keep in your wallet for example.  
Bitcoin is still very much needed not only to open and close channels but for long term safe storage and larger transactions that need the best security available.
It would be stupid to use LN to buy a house for example.

Basically the guy sold some bitcoins he didn't have (so he had to borrow them) with a promise that he'd replenish the bitcoins he borrowed. 
If the price goes up then he needs to pay more money to replenish the bitcoins.. if the price of btc goes down then he has to pay less money to replenish the bitcoins ... so if the price goes down he makes money.  Sold high then bought low.  
Since the price continued to rally (go up) he lost money.

If btrash wants to make that argument it should start by removing the fixed supply.  Then increase the inflation rate (already did that, but it should be continuous)

I haven't recommended Coinbase for sometime.  I use Gemini and it's been fine for me so far.  
One of my friends who is new to crypto withdrew a little of his Bitcoin from Coinbase to his ledger as a test.  Then when he went to withdraw the rest he accidentally sent it to the address which sent him his bitcoin from his first withdrawal.   So he sent his Bitcoin from coinbase to coinbase essentially. 
He called customer support the customer service rep flat out lied to him and told him his Bitcoin was gone.  Despite the coin being swept into their cold storage immediately.  He ended up having to file a claim with the FTC.  They finally gave him his Bitcoin back on the final day they had to respond to the complaint.  
Back in 2014 they use to have support staff that understood the basics of how Bitcoin worked.  Now their support staff knew less than he did.

Proof of stake as a consensus mechanism for a blockchain is less than worthless as in harmful.  Adding it to bitcoin can only weaken it.

Well I think it was a needed requirement politically.  Not only does it encourage the use of the lightning network and segwit which is needed for the protection against covert Asicboost.  
From a political narrative it absolutely proves without a doubt that the bcash community was disingenuous with their intentions.
It also shows that small blocks are in fact needed for the freedom and security of the system.

He claims that because you can use litecoin on the lightning network it somehow increases the supply.  This is false.  There is a lightning network for Bitcoin and one for Litecoin.  You need to do an atomic swap to cross networks.  This atomic swap operation is changing your litecoin to bitcoin when you are paying a Lightning invoice on the BTC lightning network with litecoin.  
Such a fundamental misunderstanding on the topic makes it a waste for me to continue to even listen to this idiot.

So it's been lovely talking with you, but you've absolutely failed to demonstrate any intellectual grasp of the LN.  It's like i'm talking to a wall.  You have not incorporated any of the input I have shared or done anything I have asked.  Until you do begin to use that organ between your ears I see no point in continuing with this conversation. 


Well if the bitcoin blockchain is 10/10 secure then the LN is 9.9 secure.  The contracts are cemented into the blockchain.  It's a hot wallet... so it's about as secure as having bitcoin on your cell phone or internet connected device.  
Actually right now the protocol kind of prohibits using LN to buy very expensive things.  That may change in the future but for now it's not a thing. 


This is a lie.  


They can't do fractional reserve banking on LN it's all open and transparent on the blockchain. This is a bold faced lie. When you put something into LN it's on the blockchain.  You can only transact the amount of bitcoin you put into the channel.  
The shitty analogy you've come up with also applies to exchanges and tradtional bitcoin now.  Ever notice when Coinbase shuts down withdrawls?  They only keep so much Bitcoin in hot wallets because of security concerns.  This shields them from hackers, zero day exploits, and the highly improbable 51% attack.  
Exchanges only operate with a small amount available in their hot wallets the rest are in cold wallets.  Nothing really stops them from using that "unused" bitcoin for other investments.  AKA fractional reserve banking.

Personally I think there is immense value in playing with small amounts and getting comfortable with the technology and security practices.  It's gotten a lot better, but there is still a long way to go.  
Get a hardware wallet, get a crypto steel.  Get a few usb sticks to encrypt and back up your seed with in various locations.  
Setup a full node.  Mine a little even if it's just with an alt coin.  
Learn about major hacks in crypto and why they happened.  What happened with MtGox, what happened with the ethereum DAO, and so on and so forth. 
Learn why Bitcoin and not "Blockchain" is the future.

To mine Bitcoin you are expending energy.  Energy costs money.  This means to do a 51% attack the attacker needs to use more energy than 50%of the network until they take control of the chain and do what they want to do.

I'm sure we will see bigger blocks in due time.  Bitcoin as wonderful as it is ... is still not yet ready to replace the global financial system.  
The support for big blocks was making a mountain out of a mole hill.  Business people think "Oh temporary minor problem, drop everything and address it" ... it's not a mature way to deal with things.  
First they want to optimize the block propagation and then we can look into responsibly increasing the block size.  It's not a task to be taken lightly.  
I think it's cool bcash is doing some research on increasing the blocksize, but really I don't have much faith they will find anything useful.. and if they do we can use it. 
Being able to run a full node on a normal computer is critical for Bitcoin to remain nationstate hard.

This hasn't been my experience at all.  The rivets never bound for me.  The only time I ever had issues opening it was trying to open it the wrong way.  So you flip and try again.  It's not clear tactilely but it's not a big deal.  It opens smoothly and is quite enjoyable to play with.
You don't need a screw driver you can use one of the included letter pieces.  This feature is nice since storing your keys is suppose to be semi-permanent with the device. 
I found the letters to be legible just fine.
I noticed you're clean clear professional tone.  Not to mention that promo code.
thesteely seems like an okay product.  However it's clear that cryptosteel is far superior for the following meaningful and true reasons.  
1.  Cryptosteel allows you to store the unit in a manner the characters cannot be seen.  
2.  Cryptosteel allows you to put a padlock on the unit or multiple units.  This is great for deterring against quick theft attacks where the attacker could just open it up snap 2 photos (only one with steely but the steely has no padlock)
3.  This is the deal breaker for me.  The steely only has upper case letters.  Cryptosteel offers a package that has upper, lower, number, and special characters.  Enough for me to store a base64 encrypted key.  Yeah you could steal my cryptosteel and still not have my keys.  
4.  I'm not sure about just laser engraving the keys.  It's certainly more legible than the cryptosteel, but stamping seems to be the standard for fire resistant/permanent lettering.  I don't recall ever seeing serial numbers on firearms being laser engraved.  They are typically stamped in.  The lettering must be permanent. 
I'd like to see steely double sided with an anykey package  at a lower price point than cryptosteel.  So like 1 sided for 75 and 2 sided for 150.  Maybe the Anykey package double sided for 200.  At this pricepoint I'd favor thesteely over cryptosteel.  
I'd also like to see the laser engraved keys be put in a fire for a significant amount of time to make sure it's fire resistant.  
Good luck to you.

The standard has moved away from paper wallets to HD wallets.   Paper wallets encourage address reuse.  Printing isn't good.  It's better to write it down.  It's easier and more reliable to write down and secure a list of 24 words that leads to as many addresses as you could want compared to writing a base58 private key down.   You can use a watch only address wallet.  
So go do some research before you accuse me of spreading misinformation.

OMG it's not about storage it's about bandwidth what is wrong with you
@_date: 2018-11-16 13:23:18
1.  Basically to add a page to the blockchain you need to win a lottery.   Sp you have to construct a valid block and find a suitable hash for it.  Which should take the entire mining network about 10 minutes to find one.   Since Bitcoin uses more energy than many small counties you can see that it would be challenging and expensive for a single entity to command enough energy to have enough hash power to have 51% of the network. 
So basically that hash is very hard to produce and easy to verify.  That is how you know you have the right data because you compare the difficulty to the hashes and you verify the hash.  If we're talking a difficulty rating that commands exahashes per second you can rest assured that it's valid.  That being said it's still probability so until you have enough confirmations large transactions should not be trusted.
2.  This is one of the reasons blocksize is a scaling resource that needs to be responsibly managed.  The bigger factor is bandwidth resources.  Big blocks would centralize Bitcoin to fairly high end fiber networks.  Last year Bitcoin could only do 4-7 tx per second with 1 mb.  Now with segwit we can do a bit more because the max blocksize is 3.8 mb.  So 13-24 tx per second.  Still not impressive.  This is why we have lightning which is a solution that will allow Bitcoin to really scale well.
3 ...  Well the answer here is it depends.  Tracked by who? Random joe schmo?  Probably not.  Major exchanges more likely of it's coming through them.  CIA/NSA probably if the individual didn't use good operational security.  Bitcoin is pseudononymous.
4.  Pretty much yes but there are efforts to expand to radio and satellite networks as well.

What's not making sense?  The fact that segwit is a soft fork and unless you use segwit ie use a segwit address your tx is still vulnerable malleability?
That the type of programming language used can limit what you can do with it?
I would.agree it fixed covert asicboost because it's obvious if someone is doing it now.  So it's no longer covert.
Malleability still exists... We just have a way to avoid exposure to it.

Except for calling a blockchain a database because that's fucking stupid for everyone who has even CS 102 under their belt.  Especially considering you're being so pedantic with your utxo explainaton.
Bitcoin is basically the total sum of the transactions. The latest utxo on a blockchain is what we call Bitcoin.  When we run through and balance our ledger we can see "bitcoin" conceptually move from one address to another.  Hence block explorer.
The blockchain is a datastructure.  If it were a database we wouldn't need to process the blockchain resuls into a database.

I do not like coinbase, I do like gemini.  If you're a US citizen these are your best/safest options for buying Bitcoin.  Both exchanges are regulated.  Your USD value in these accounts are FDIC insured.  
The safest option would be to look into properly securing your Bitcoin with respect to the value you're looking to hold.  You can get a Trezor for about 80 bucks ... They have done an excellent job in providing security.  It's best to buy them from the manufacturer as there are fakes.  AFAIK there is an easy way to tell the difference.  Basically the holographic tamper sticker on the fake trezor's is different.  
You'll need access to a computer which clean and has never been on the internet.  When you get your seed you'll want to put the seed on an encrypted USB stick and distribute them in geographic locations.  Your seed is life.  
As you get more money involved you'll want to consider even more durable/secure/expensive practices.  
The absolute safest way to buy bitcoin in my opinion as an American is to wire money to Gemini and buy bitcoin and immediately transfer it to your secure wallet.  
In my opinion this is way overkill.  Particularly with respect to the amount you're looking to buy in.  That being said this is Bitcoin and being paranoid is required. 
If you're looking for privacy then I'd suggest looking into tor/vpn protonmail binance and moving the coin through Monero (XMR) then to your wallet.  You may want to move the Bitcoin several times between Gemini to Binance (perhaps several different exchanges that offer BTC to XMR and different accounts on each exchange) and varying the amounts you move the bitcoin through.  It's also important to never reuse the address. 
@_date: 2018-03-01 14:34:22

“The root problem with conventional currency is all the trust that’s required to make it work.

Banks must be trusted to hold our money and transfer it electronically, but they lend it out in waves of credit bubbles with hardly a fraction in reserve.”

My understanding is that this requires opening the device up and soldering a few points.
I prefer an open source solution.  Vulnerabilities are identified faster.  Fail fast and hard.
The ledger's obvious over sights with basic security features already solved by the Trezor prior to their initial offering is quite frankly inexcusable.  
This is the problem with technology development today.  Computer Scientist and Engineers are professionals.  We need to start acting like it and we must do it without permission. 
We need to quit our jobs if they do not allow us to operate in a professional capacity.   If they push back on security standards the line must be drawn.
As consumers we need to begin resisting sharing our personal information with companies.  The reality of the matter is these companies are NOT responsible with our data.  The businesses are greedy teenagers bullying developers who are naive insecure little children.

Overall yes, that sounds about right.  However if you're talking about a few hundred dollars worth of bitcoin you're good.  If you're talking like 100k+ ... then you really should have your seed generated on a machine that doesn't talk to the internet. 
So your electrum wallet should be on an airgapped machine.

So say you download bitaddress put it on a secure airgapped machine etc. Then you manually put it into crypto steel.  Each time you do it you're spending like an hour or so.
Or you could have a secure airgapped computer with an HD wallet save one set of 24 words in crypto steel.  Back it up on usb keys.

What we're saying is that your understanding of that chart and the way you express it is skewed due to changes in the Bitcoin protocol.  Also, changes in the space. 
It's the same reason when you compare crime stats between countries you can only place a limited amount of value in the comparison because they aren't representative of reliable data.  Differences in laws, accessibility, culture, and practices all factor into the stats you're comparing.
Now that the fork mania (which I would argue is a bubble) has died down significantly and that now some of the major players are grouping their payments to customers in BTC in 1 large transaction (which only gets counted as 1 in your chart).  In other words what would previously be considered 100 transactions is now only 1 transaction.

Before Bitcoin a central authority was required to control the monetary system.  With bitcoin no such entity need exist.  This is an opportunity to take that power and distribute it equally among the people for the first time in history.  
It is the birth of a new style of business.  A business with employees, and without managers or owners seeking profit.   
Bitcoin is only valuable so much as it is immutable. Without immutability it cannot properly fulfill it's role as a monetary platform.  Introducing the requirement of trust in a person or group of people would fundamentally invalidate the entire project.  
Bcash can't scale.  The Bitcoin project has squeezed out almost everything it can out of block propagation.  The best ideas the btrash team has largely have already been implemented in Bitcoin.  Their scaling approach is to wait decades and centralize around big corporations, banks, and governments.  If this is to be I'd rather stick with regular old fiat.  
Bitcoin's mining network is running on the best possible hardware.  To compromise the integrity of the blockchain you'd have to invest billions.  It wouldn't be too difficult to route around either.  
Proof of stake is fundamentally not nation state hard.  It's not even viable from a game theory perspective.  
So show me another crypto currency with a stronger mining network or mechanism to keep the blockchain immutable.  Show me the dedication to keeping the system lightweight enough to run on hardware accessible to pretty much anyone in the world.  Show me a project that can be ran over TOR, Satalite, and mesh networks.  Then I'd tell you that is Bitcoin.

If you're going to invest 5k in to bitcoin and you're too cheap to buy a trezor or ledger you deserve to have your money stolen.
AFAIK blockchain.info isn't a scam, but they aren't your best friend either.  They aren't a good platform to store your btc on long term.  You're better off with another exchange, but if you're just looking to buy and move to a real wallet then you should be fine.

The bulk of the energy consumption is computing the hash.  The minimum energy needed varies depending upon the power of the network.  The more greedy people running bitcoin miners the more secure the network is against greedy people trying to fraud the network.  
Nothing is absolutely secure.  Even Bitcoin, but Bitcoin is probably one of the most secure if not the most secure systems ever created in human history.   
A security model is typically designed around weighing the risk vs. reward.  Risk involves penalty and percent chance of being caught.  With bitcoin the concern of being caught can be reduced significantly for many crimes, but running a nuclear power plant + bitcoin miners really reduces the ability to operate covertly.  Risk also involves the financial commitment to committing the attack.  
If you're going to invest the money into the technology to steal Ferraris you're putting more of a financial investment into stealing cars than someone who spent 5 dollars for a slimjim to boost a 1999 Toyota corolla.  
I would say having to design a cutting edge ASIC, and produce it in a top of the line FAB to mine Bitcoin with a nuclear reactor on your side is a pretty significant barrier to entry in compromising the Bitcoin network.  
So more greed the more secure the network is.  Greed's being controlled by the mechanism in place.  
Without this energy expenditure the network would be far less secure and vulnerable to attack than it is today.  This is not wasteful ... it's very necessary.

Yes, but lightning is still based on the Bitcoin protocol.  I fail to see how payment channels would allow for a fraction of a satoshi to be sent when the network relies on the exchange of signed transactions that can be broadcast to the network.  If you tried to broadcast a fraction of a satoshi then I believe the bitcoin network would reject the transaction defeating the security of the LN.

None of these companies follow KYC with the possible exception of google because they actually might be considered something of a money transmitter with google pay but i'm not sure.
The KYC requirements are based on whether or not the business is transmitting money between individuals.
That's it.  That's when a company needs to engage with KYC/AML.  
A business doing standard transactions for products and other services do not need to take part in KYC/AML.

I want you to know that your post here is pretty ignorant and absolutely incorrect.  
1.  What you think the value behind Bitcoin is wrong.  You should be smacked talking about "the technology, behind it the blockchain" .   The blockchain is just a fucking data structure like a hashtable. 
2.  The blockchain is merely a component of Bitcoin.  It's worthless without the distributed node and mining network.  Bitcoin is valuable because it's immutable.  It's a means of transmitting value without trust.  You can trust that no one is able to change the data in the blockchain.  Without the mining network and nodes securing write access to the blockchain ... with proof of stake for example.  You're introducing trust back into the system. 
3.  Lightning isn't a token.  Lightning is a way to leverage Bitcoin's trustless model in a manner in which you can make instant transactions using smart contracts between peers with links established through on chain transactions.  You're transacting Bitcoin.

Your BTC is most valuable.  So if you want to claim your fork money then it's going to require you to put your priv keys in some less than reputable/secure wallets/devices to do so.  Therefore if you put your priv keys in an area where they could be stolen.  Probably best to simply move them.

It's also the way of thinking that got people on the Challenger killed.  This isn't building a website that hosts fart jokes.  It's building a global financial system that must run 24/7 without failure.  
The lack of security in our tech today is a serious threat.  It's very likely that the next car you drive in can be hacked remotely and controlled to crash.  
We are fucking children in charge of the entire world that just learned to salt and hash our passwords and use HTTPS yesterday.
How did we get here you might ask?  We got here by losing the professionalism in the industry and bowing to the demands of people like Roger Ver.  That's all well and good when you're not building a critical system.  When you're building a critical system that is intended to run tens of trillions of dollars one day.  The will of the business man should be dismissed.  
Bitcoin is in beta .. fucking deal with it (the high fees).  This is the internet in 1986.  If Roger really wanted to address high fees he'd have stepped aside and let the professionals do their fucking job. 
The reality of the matter is Roger Ver saw this as a business opportunity to at best take control of bitcoin and at worse (possible outcome for him) get his name out there and make a lot of Bitcoin and money for himself.

Immutability comes from ensuring that what was written can never be rewritten again.  That's what immutability means.

There is this thing called public private key cryptography.  It's used to secure many things on the internet.  
With Bitcoin you create a private key and a public key.  You can hand out the public key and people can use it to verify that message you send are from you and have not been altered by comparing the hash.  Only your private key can make a hash for a message, but everyone can use your public key to verify the hash matches your message.   If someone tries to change one bit the hash will change and the message will not validate.  
In order to write to the blockchain you must find one of these hashes that has so many leading 0's.  This makes it possible to estimate  probability.  
You're essentially playing a lottery in order to find the proper hash that allows you to write to the blockchain.  In order to do this many many many hashes are performed.  Your standard miner these days do many terahashes per second ... so trillions per second and there are tens of thousands of them around the world.  
It's the worlds largest supercomputer specifically designed to do one thing and one thing only.  Find hashes that unlock the keys to write to the blockchain.
This costs money in terms of energy.  It's physics.  It's physically impossible to compute the hashes necessary without the mining network.  All the miners are bought and paid for months before they are even manufactured.  You're talking billions upon billions of dollars of investment in order to perform a 51% attack that would be harmful to the network.  Which we could pretty easily get around if we needed too.
The lightning network is based on the blockchain.  You and I have a special transaction on the blockchain.  You and Alice have a special transaction on the blockchain.  Then we just pass state between ourselves. I'll give you the ability to broadcast a transaction for 1 btc that we have in our channel if you prove to me that you've given the ability to Alice because I want to pay Alice.  This is how a payment channel works.  Now imagine I have 8 contracts. You have 8 contracts Alice has 8 contracts all with other people who also have 8 contracts with other people.  Now we have a network.  The lightning network. 
The trust on the Lightning network is a little less because you do need to have your channels monitored either by yourself or a third party (which don't  know about your channels because of the cryptography used ... this means collusion isn't effective)

Think of the transaction as a check.  Except this type of check the signature cannot be forged and you can validate it yourself.

Happy new year!! ... Basically a data structure is a way of storing data in code.  An array or linked list would be a data structure. Usually the data is stored in some format so that it's easier to perform some function.  Sometimes it is to make searching easier (databases use these types of data structures often).  
In the case of the Blockchain the data structure makes pulling data from it ... well.. a pain in the fucking ass.  
A database is an application that stores data in an unified manner.  A database allows for better data storage/access and often times can even perform certain tasks on the data pretty easily.  
The most popular type of database is a sql database.  SQL stands for Structured Query Language.  It's very good for storing data in a highly normalized format for querying reports.  Also I like using different designs for different purposes.  
The most common purpose is for storing user/application data and for scalability sake it's typically advisable to store the data the way the business application wants to use it.  This is why nosql databases have become so popular, but I don't really see their value so I'd have to learn more about them.

You can't create a fake bitcoin.  Period.  
You can potentially rip someone off if they accept 0 conf transactions.  Those would be relatively small purchases that would need to be done in person because you wouldn't ship before you'd expect a confirmation.  
If you wanted to pull a legit double spend you'd have to control the majority of the hashing power.  So you're competing against a 4 billion dollar company and you're running a nuclear power plant.  
There isn't anything you can buy in order to make that type of venture worth it.  They would just repo your fleet of airbuses.  
Finally the only realistic risk is if somehow the person tricks you into thinking your bitcoin transaction  went through when it really didn't.  I haven't examined a whole lot of wallets for security flaws and attack vectors like that, but I would imagine the good wallets have decent security.

To that I frankly say... You're a fucking idiot.  Yes you deserved that. 
From a technical standpoint Bitcoin is absolutely worthless if an entity can compromise it's immutability. 
Bitcoin is bitcoin.  It's owned and controlled by no one.  There is no Bitcoin CEO to threaten and drag into court.  That's what is attractive about the project and why it was started in the first place.

A blockchain isn't anything but a datastore.  It's only immutable if it can't be over written.  Without a legitimate consensus protocol (PoW) it cannot provably be immutable.

We're not happy about ASICBOOST, but it is an optimization that would be included in the difficulty and ultimately isn't a big deal.
The big deal is Jihan had a patent on his version of ASICBOOST which gave him a significant advantage.  If anyone tried to copy it now we're no longer on a level playing field and that's bad.  
The patent that Halong used is a defensive patent.  It's more like the MIT license.  Everyone is free to use this patent so long as they include their own related patents under the same type of deal.  This makes it so that Halong's superior version of ASICBOOST isn't giving a competitive advantage to anyone. 
We didn't hate the technology per-say.  We didn't like that it further encouraged mining empty blocks (which also Halong's doesn't do).  
**PoW Change**
I listened to your debate yesterday.  Changing the PoW makes no sense.  If Bitcoin took this seriously at all it would ruin bitcoin.  The immutability of the network would be at significant risk.  Bitcoin cash supporters would not opt to change their PoW and then they would have the most powerful network.  It's like a situation where we both have a gun pointed at one another and we need to put the gun down at the same time.
We need to support Halong as a new mining company.  Hopefully Samsung is working for someone other than Bitmain.  This space is very new and it will be a while before we can expect there to be real competition.
If we were to switch PoW Bitmain is in the best position to capitalize on that.  They already have engineers and experience making ASICs, they already have the connections.  They already are way in the black.  Halong would be wiped out.  Avalon (who is holding on by a thread it seems) would be under significant pressure.  Yes Entrepreneurs take risks, but they are calculated risks.  If they see a business model that the community could pull the rug out from under them before they even launch or have a shot in hell to ROI.  They aren't going to be behind that.  
Who makes the mining hardware is of less importance than the mining pools.  It would be more helpful to the decentralization of the network if we had p2p pools.  We just need to grow and wait until companies like nVidia step up and start making ASICs.

They are both relatively simple.  However HD wallets are better than paper wallets.  
You store 12-24 words and that will recover a bunch of addresses rather than just 1.  You can store it easily in something like cryptosteel.

I really don't see the value in turing complete smart contracts on the blockchain.  I think DAOs can work on layer 2 or 3 and be far more effective.  
A blockchain is an isolated environment.  You cannot rely upon external mechanisms like data storage etc. inside a blockchain.  
Something like Siacoin should be implemented on layer 2 over lightning.  You pay a slow steady amount of coin to have data stored.  You can have them put up some collateral that they will store the data and make it available.  You can hire people to do proofs against it etc. etc.

If Bitcoin is the internet Ethereum is AOL.
AOL was great in it's day.  It was fun .. but it' was a closed system.  What applications do we use today that aren't somewhat a means to communicate outside of our own computer?  IDEs okay even those have abilities to reach out and get new packages and use version control.  Text editors ... those might even reach out for spell checking.  
Back then the real internet was incredibly boring and frustrating to use compared to AOL. 
Ethereum is ultimately a closed eco system and therefore it isn't interesting.  It's no where near immutable .. it's not decentralized despite being distributed.  Making ICOs is the equivalent of going into an AOL chatroom and IMing someone A/S/L.  
I didn't know what Radien was.. but again it's intent is within the ecosystem where as the LN has it's component in-echo system it's also capable of doing cross chain atomic swaps.  
I'd be more interested in a decentralized uber running with lightning as the payment channel.  So rather than running a decentralized token inside the echo system. You run a decentralized network to connect people and do payments over the LN.  Perhaps a side chain for ratings.  
Proof of Stake has fundamental issues at the game theory level. It's not viable for a first class crypto currency.  It's not going to be censorship resistant and durable enough to withstand attacks from central banks.  These Banks aren't stupid, there are people there who fully comprehend what Bitcoin is, why it exists, and what's it's capable of doing.  Just like the banks new that the housing crisis was coming they played dumb and were "just as shocked as everyone else".  
Rootstock sounds interesting and I think that it's a good exercise for research.  I'm not sure if it's going to be the final form, but I think we'll learn something from the project that will be integrated into something that helps Bitcoin reach the pinnacle level.

Wage slavery ... that implies that you must work, you have no choice in the manner and conditions that you work under, and you have no choice in the amount you are paid.
The mental gymnastics that you are doing to justify your position sickens me.  
Yes. You are obligated to eat.  You are obligated to have shelter. and clothing.  These are natural obligations.  
Government obligations are NOT natural.  Why can't you claim a piece of land, build a shelter, and raise food upon it.  Government is the answer to this question.  So government is preventing you from fulfilling your natural obligations.  
The cost of the natural obligations is very small compared to the government imposed obligations required to fulfill your natural obligations on your own.  Property taxes, income taxes, sales tax etc. 
In short the notion that corporations are somehow the villain here is ludicrous.  The villain is the government.  
Everyone of us can choose to work for someone else or not to work for someone else.  We can work for ourselves.  When you choose to go work for someone else you are not barred from changing your mind.  You are not barred from changing your employer.  
Slaves cannot own their own property.  Slaves don't have a choice in who their owners are.  Your abuse of this term is pretty substantial.  The hyperbole cannot be understated.

In 2008 we didn't have a problem because of national debt.  We had a problem because of individual debt due to very poor credit standards.  While those credit standards have weakened a little bit in the past couple of years they are no where near as weak as they use to be.
So until you see banks having people invest in mutual funds for student loans and what not I wouldn't expect to see what we saw in 2008.  It will come in a different manner.

It cost me 2400 dollars to 51% attack (more like 99% attack) the first scenario.  I used your electricity to do it too. 
Calculate how much it would cost to do the 51% attack on the Bitcoin blockchain? 
You could probably take one of these big time mining operations and actually rewrite the first few years of the bitcoin blockchain fairly quickly.  However since it continually becomes more difficult you'd eventually fall behind the average 10 minutes to the point where you couldn't catch up.  Each block that is written to the blockchain adds security to the previous blocks.
The same can't be said for for scenario 1.
What's the value of scenario 2?  Why would you use a blockchain over a SQL database?  You could hash the values entered into the database and you're accomplishing the exact same thing.

Trashing fiat currency because there is nothing behind it.  Now Bitcoin comes along and he can either change his mind based on new evidence or double down on his position ...
Over the past decade people who put money into gold haven't done well.  People who kept their money in the market recovered fine.  People who put their money into Bitcoin ... well they are rich as fuck.  
Gold is manipulated.  We've had digital gold before it wont work.  We had gold money ... it didn't work (you need to trust a central party to hold on to the value and not fractionally reserve which is against their own self interest.)

The ASIC launch for Bitcoin was an epic battle.  I mean you had Avalon, BFL, and KNC all competing.  The economic incentive behind a litecoin/scrypt miner is nothing compared to what it was when Bitcoin was being launched.
Does anyone mine LTC or Scrypt with processors anymore?  
If Litecoin claims a prominent position (which I think there is a good chance it will) in the longterm crypto space you'll see there will be no point in mining with GPUs once the market is flooded with litecoin miners.
It took about 1.5-2 years for GPU mining to completely die when bitcoin ASICs were dying down.
To put it another way.  If Bitcoin were to magically be gone tomorrow and an "asic resistant" coin like Litecoin or Monero were to take it's spot.  You'd quickly see the profitability potential of GPU mining on either platform die rather quickly.

No, this is fucking wrong.  
Bitcoin is safe because of large numbers, pseudo anonymity, and the computing power writing the ledger.  
When you create a bitcoin address.  Provided you create it correctly you can rest assured that address will never be created again.  You can sign your transactions offline using an appropriate wallet keeping them safe from hacking attempts.  They would have to target you specifically to get your key. Hard to hack paper over the internet. 
Bitcoin doesn't hold your personal information.  They can't hack the blockchain and steel your information and sell it on the black market.  There isn't a list of usernames and passwords sitting there in plain text that might give you access to a bunch of bank accounts etc. etc. 
The market behind bitcoin has created the most powerful distributed super computer for writing the blockchain.  Everyone can rest assured that it cannot be over written or changed unless someone spends all of the money to build an equivalent network.  
Finally you don't need to worry about Bitcoin being shut down by a single entity because it's the largest distributed single purpose network ever created.  There are over 10,000 publicly available nodes all over the world and many more that are not publicly viewable.  There are a bunch of miners all over the world.  There are a lot of pools, and more pools could be spun up as needed.

Paypal is a platform that allows people to pay one another.  People have accounts and they can withdraw or deposit money into that account with regular banks.
If Paypal created Paypal shares and still allowed you to deposit money and buy paypal shares and then you sent that to someone on the paypal platform and had them sell the paypal shares and put USD in their bank account.  THEY WOULD BE COINBASE.
Guess what.  Coinbase is a MONEY TRANSMITTER.

If they are using a wallet that uses standard Bitcoin nodes they don't have SSL.  If you're using the public wifi you could trick their device into connecting to nodes you control.  Then present them with information that claims that the transaction was valid.

If you want to use lightning you need to run a lightning node.  Nodes and wallets are the same thing.   
If you want to use lightning you need to open a channel which is an on chain smart contract transaction.  In order to keep the channel open you need to either be online to monitor it or have a 3rd party monitor it for you thanks to segwit.  
So you don't need to be online, but you want to be online as much as possible so that your node can transact

He's saying that non-mining nodes are less important than mining nodes for the security of the network.
On a macro scale this is true. Mining nodes ensure that the blockchain cannot be overwritten.  The more hashing power you have behind your network the more confident you can be in your transactions being secure when they are written to a block.
Non-mining nodes are STILL very important.  They help kick bad actors off the the network and prevent bad data propagating throughout the network.  They provide better security for receiving payments. 
Most importantly right now they serve to protect the protocol.  As you may or may not know ... Bitcoin has a weakness in it's decentralized nature.  In an ideal world we wouldn't have pools and we would have bitcoin miners being produced by many companies as a commodity product.  
The pools are a limited risk because we've seen how miners react when a pool approaches 51%.  
We're sitting on our hands waiting for someone to rise up against Bitmain ... I really hope Samsung pulls through with something good.
I'd really like to see a 400 watt bitcoin miner with about the same efficiency as an S9 ... Or about 3.4TH for about 400 watts.

I haven't heard of kilosats before and being American while I am aware of the metric system and can use it.  I still think in the English system.  I haven't seen any wallets or exchanges use this specific type of terminology.  I really like it.  
The value would be in adopting the terminology and making it easier to people to adopt to thinking about Bitcoin in terms of relative value to their currencies.

No it's not.  Lets say you have a company and you record access to the building in a blockchain and the blockchain is secured with PoW SHA256 and all the company's computers "secure it"
I am an employee.  I gain access to your office and hook up my antminer S9 and rewrite the block that recorded my accessing of the building .. because I have more hashing power than your office the nodes accept my reward as legitimate.  
Lets take an example where it's Proof of authority.  Only you can write to your blockchain.. so the hash is based on a private key you alone possess and the previous block.
You're accused of breaking into your own office and stealing or damaging equipment to collect insurance money.  Your blockchain wouldn't be legitimate evidence that you didn't do it, because only you can write to it.  There is no way for you to prove to me that you didn't rewrite it.

I am fine with things like the trezor and ledger.  Typical software wallets I'm not a fan of security wise.  
The reality is anything for LTS that should be super secure should really only be in Bitcoin and Litecoin.  These are the only two cryptos that actually matter.  Everything else is either prototyping for Bitcoin, teaching the Bitcoin community lessons, or just fodder.

I disagree.  When we think of protocol with respect to computers we lean towards computers interacting with one another. 
However protocol simply means actors interacting with one another.  People are actors that interact with Bitcoin and the terminology we use is part of the overall Bitcoin Protocol.
I don't consider things like BIP38 and BIP39 for example to be proposals to improve the bitcoin protocol from the perspective of nodes communicating with one another over the internet.  They improve how humans interact with Bitcoin.

You don't understand this shit at all.
No one controls LN it's a trustless system built upon Bitcoin's blockchain.  
When you run a node you can prove that you have X amount of bitcoin locked up ON CHAIN... so it's 1-1 ... 
If it were to operate like the banks then you could use 10x the amount of bitcoin you actually have... that would be problematic.

It's really not that complicated and it's not even really a puzzle.  Really it's more like playing the lottery trillions of times a second.   It's just something that can only be found through brute force and statistically will take the network about 10 minutes on average to find.

If you pay US taxes you fund terrorism and no I'm not talking about some bull shit psych job about our military being terrorists.  I'm talking about ISIS and shit.  Yup we created and funded them.  
The currency most used throughout the world BY FAR for drugs, money laundering, and terrorism is the US fucking dollar.  
You want to stop people from ODing on drugs? You legalize drugs and regulate them.  Anyone who opposes this is pure fucking evil.  We have evidence of reversing prohibition working to reduce violence in US history we have 40 years of the war on drugs increasing drug usage throughout the country.

So instead of 6 blocks to be safe you'd need 12 blocks.  It doesn't do anything.  The proof of work is what keeps the blockchain immutable.. not the number of blocks.  Now you're introducing more instability into the consensus protocol as well.  More opportunities for competing chains.

You miss the point.  The point is peter is saying put your money in gold instead of leaving it in fiat and investing in stocks, but over the past 10 years gold hasn't done shit and stocks have kicked ass.  No one is stupid enough to just leave their money uninvested.  All you had to do is put your money in the index funds and you're fine. 


I'm talking about a SHTF scenario.  No one cares about gold in the walking dead.  People care about gold in the 1800's.  
You can continue to purposefully pose stupid twists on what I am saying to try and "win" but the evidence is easily searchable.  Put 100k in the S&amp;P 500 in 2008 and add 10k each year.. how much fiat would you have today.. vs ... buying 100k in gold and buying 10k in gold... today how much fiat would you have.

Look up SALT.  Loaning money is one thing, but that isn't the same as fractional reserve banking.
With fractional reserve banking you're under the impression that when you put money into a bank... lets say 1000 dollars... that there is a 100% guarantee that the 1000 dollars will be there.  Prior to the FDIC this was not the case. If everyone does a run on the bank you might very well find out that your 1000 dollars is really only worth 100 dollars.  
You were under the impression that there was 0 risk.. when in reality there was a risk. 
Now with FDIC that risk is greatly reduced.
With loaning money for a house... it's understood that there is inherently more risk involved.

Well if you do this and the block goes to someone else.  Why not keep that block to yourself and find one that sends the right to write the next block to yourself.

The past few months people have been trying to get their fork money and most people aren't stupid enough to claim their btrash to sell it without first moving their bitcoin.

I agree that Bitcoin mining is costly, but I disagree that it's wasteful.  
Wasteful is defined as using or expending something of value carelessly, extravagantly, or to no purpose.
There is a good purpose for the energy being consumed.  It's what secures the blockchain and makes it immutable.  You're outrunning the possibility of someone else being able to change the history with every passing block.  As the network grows the feasibility of compromising the blockchain becomes more and more expensive/less possible.  We're actually talking about the laws of physics securing the blockchain.  
What PoS algorithm or competing algorithm can even come close to providing that amount of security?  Realistically how secure are these PoS coins?  
@_date: 2018-03-01 20:10:39
It's a better measurement for market share of crypto currencies then daily transactions yes.
You need to take into consideration that Eth is a closed platform/eco system and is responsible for like 90% of the tokens.
You and I could create our own ERC20 token in a matter of minutes.  There is nothing special about it.  It's less special than spinning up a website.  
Pretty much everywhere that accepts crypto currencies accepts bitcoin... the same cannot be said for eth or ltc ... and where the fuck is the external support of btrash and ripple.  I've never heard of anyone setting up a ripple ATM ... but they are 3rd in market cap.
It's complicated.  I mean look at Ethereum's subreddit compared to this one.

Can you really say that bitcoin's energy consumption is wasteful?  Why is it wasteful? To say something is wasteful is to say that the resource being used could be used better or more efficiently.  
9 years of people mining on a free market is a strong piece of evidence that economically speaking the energy usage is not wasteful.
What would be a better use for the energy?  I value you secure transactions.  Secure transactions from a traditional banking world is very expensive.  You have the R&amp;D, you have the fraud department, you have the information security, you have an awful lot of resources tied up in the traditional banking system to provide competitive services that Bitcoin offers. 
Why is security a pro for PoW, but not a con for PoS?  Are their any PoS coins out there which don't rely upon some kind of central authority?  If that's the case then they haven't solved the fundamental problem that Bitcoin solved which is true distributed consensus.  Meaning ultimately PoS is a regression rather than a progression.

Bitcoin is very much like the internet.  It's a network for storing and transmitting value.

Well I agree branding might need a little work like Ksats.  However 1000 sats is between a satoshi and a Bitcoin. 
I agree it's not a complicated idea, but it's new to me.  I haven't seen anything proposed like this.  Previous efforts to make the denomination between bitcoin and traditional currencies came from the Bitcoin side.  Millibits micro bits.  I don't like this approach.
Coming from the Satoshi side I like.  And it seems to grow well.
We could do something like this.  
1000 satoshi = 1 kat - pronounced cat (bcats?)
100 satoshi = 100 cets = centisats pronounced sets.  (maybe bsets?)
Right now 1 kat is worth about $0.09 USD . When Bitcoin reaches ~ 100,000 then 1 kat would be worth $1.00 USD . When Bitcoin reaches 1,000,000 . 1 kat would be $10.00.  At which point we might move towards cets being the common usage term.
It scales quite well and I think it would help people understand how much btc they are spending easier.  
It also accomplishes the issue where people don't understand they don't need to buy an entire Bitcoin.  Being a Bitcoiner could mean you own an entire Bitcoin.  or a bitcoinare etc.  
what do you think?

lol Bitcoins fees are based on market demand.  That's it.  If you say it's a store of value okay that's cool.

So it wasn't good for a few months when you wanted to send some baby numbers ... okay.  Bitcoin hasn't been good for years for micro transactions.  
With lightning it is good for micro transactions.  It's value is in the fact that people can take part in and own Bitcoin themselves.

Either you don't understand something and you ask a specific question, or you have some concerns because you think you understand something and specifically criticize.  Both require a certain level of knowledge in the subject matter.
Your question amounts to "I'm concenred about these Toyota cars because they don't drive off road well.  Aren't cars suppose to take us anywhere we want to go?"

Ugh ... I see why the devs are tired of responding to this stupid bull shit after 3 years.
No one technical claimed that segwit would be a magic cure.  Segwit was the first step so that we could have a good lightning network, good smart contracts (yes btrash's smart contract capabilities are severely limited without a transaction malleability fix which their dev team lacks the technical ability and creativity to solve without copying segwit).  Segwit allows for more stable and safer smart contracts and allows for other improvements in the future with LN, MAST, schnorr, and so on.  
It is not anticipated that most users will have channels open with only one other node.  The idea is that you can have many channels.  Unlike the internet which requires a physical connection, the LN is a virtual connection.  Nothing stops you from making a trust less smart contract with anyone else on the network. 
I haven't heard of anyone using it ad losing funds, and the LN on mainnet is still considered beta. 
How does he know there are no adversaries?  LN is an open network anyone including Roger Ver and this fat douche can go on and do whatever they want.  
Yup you need to be online to receive funds.  There are potentially solutions around this still to be worked on.  However LN is meant to optimize day to day transactions.  If you're a merchant you're going to be online.  Nothing says your lightning node must be at the same location as your POS terminal.  Merchants must be online to receive credit cards.  You need to be online to send on chain transactions.  Is this really a big deal?  
In other words it's not advisable for someone to put large amounts of capital in LN.  If you're buying coffee LN is great you have a few hundred bucks and you're off to the races with super fast transactions and lightning speed.
Sorry you're not buying a lambo over the lightning network.  That would be stupid.  Most likely you'd need to utilize many routes to accomplish the transaction and if you suffer any technical difficulties the security of the transaction is on you not the network.  Large purchases should still be done on chain.
What do merchants do when their credit card machines stop working?  Hmm.. They could still do an on chain transaction.  If they are really suffering some internet outages then neither LN, on chain, or debit/credit is going to work.  
[what is this stupid fat fuck talking about](
With LN the paying node decides the route.  If such routing is so dangerous explain to me how TOR works and the NSA can't crack it.  
Why doesn't he explain exactly how an attack would work? I can explain to you how a MITM attack works.  Just look up any defcon talk on the subject matter and they will explain to you in very simple terms how such things work.
He doesn't explain what the problem is that isn't solved.  He starts by saying this is a problem.. then says "it's the same as the internet" (it's not).  Just because humans and dogs have hearts doesn't mean they are the same.  It's like saying humans can't possibly walk on two legs because dogs can't walk on two legs.  
His graph is wrong.  You'd have your own node.  You open a channel you're paying a node your connected to to pay another node it's connected.  You're moving data around.  Even if regulators wanted to intervene there is nothing they can do except perhaps prevent companies like coinbase from having LN channels.  We've already seen ways around this so... there nips that in the butt.
This is a strawman attack.  People are not going to have just 1 channel they will have more like 4-8 ... 
Anyway I'm done.  Fuck you for having me waste time on this bull shit and fuck him for being a lying sack of shit.  He should spend more time at the gym then scamming people.

You don't understand.  The screen isn't just a usability feature.  It's a security feature.  The other devices also have apps too.  If the computer is compromised nothing on it can be trusted.  The app can present to you an address / amount, but send the wrong one to the device to be signed.  It opens an attack vector.  With the trezor or ledger if you attack their software but not the vendor's as well this trick wont work because you'll see on the device's screen that the device received the wrong transaction data. 


I didn't say piece of paper.  I said fireproof method like cryptosteel.  
Neither an SD card in a fireproof safe or piece of paper in a fireproof safe.  
There is no such thing as a fire proof safe.  Just fire resistant.   is rated for so many degrees and such amount of time.  It only protects the contents from being burned not getting unreasonably hot.  You need a higher quality safe to protect SD cards than you do to protect paper, and even then ... You're taking some chances in my opinion. 
Cryptosteel inside a quality fire resistant safe is the way to go.  Cryptosteel without a quality fire resistant safe (which typically cost more than a grand by the way) is still better than paper or plastic.

Increasing the blocksize leads towards centralization.  The ability for a common person to be able to run a full node must be maintained. 
For Bitcoin to compete on the world stage it needs to do far more transactions than 7 per second each mb would provide.  Even if the blocks were 100 MB it would be barely a fraction of what we'd need to handle.   Then you're talking about delays between propagating blocks across the network etc.

What a piece of shit article.  First off what the fuck is a hub.  You mean node?  
He's completely reversed the logic.  The FUD argument against lightning is related to the way payment channels work.  People think with lightning everyone will want to connect to establishments with large liquidity in a hub and spoke model.  
While this might be a possibility it isn't how some wallets are being designed.  Like I don't choose my bitcoin node peers I wouldn't choose my lightning network peers either.  
The concern is that Money Transmitters potentially wouldn't want to use lightning because of KYC laws they are subject too due to their pre-existing status as Money Transmitters. 
This article is complete and utter garbage.

Having big banks and corporations be the only ones capable of running nodes is FAR fucking worse than having them run major LN hubs if you will.  Nodes protect the protocol.  LN is simply a layer 2 and it's trustless.  
Furthermore Andreas specifically came out and spoke about how it's unlikely we will see banks or corporations like Coinbase actually run LN nodes due to KYC/AML laws.

The Bitcoin vs. Bcash debate is a debate that comes down to one thing.  Is it acceptable to limit the options for Bitcoin's security model.  
If usability and adopting is more important than maintaining Bitcoin's ability to resist nation state attacks then bcash is viable.
If you're of the mindset that Bitcoin absolutely needs to be hardened against nation state censorship.  Then you need to maintain the ability for Bitcoin to run over non traditional sub optimal networks. 
 the TOR network, satellite, and various mesh networks.  
The Bcash community is split.  There is a faction in the Bcash community opening declaring that Bitcoin should be ran by governments and banks.  I think it's great we don't have to deal with those people anymore in the Bitcoin community.  
Roger Ver is not a technical person.  Bitcoin is a technical space.  In other words what Roger Ver thinks.  What Tone Vays thinks.  What Richard Heart thinks.  Means absolutely nothing.  He should be completely and entirely dismissed.  I don't like Zuckerberg, but the quote from the Social network belongs here.  The Bitcoin devs are doing things that Roger Ver and company are intellectually and creatively incapable and they have no right to the attention of the devs.  
Maybe get Amaury Sechet to debate Jameson Lopp.  When Lopp debated Roger ... the silence was DEAFENING with respect to Lopp's questions about the technical aspects.  
Bcash might have a leg to stand on if a gigabyte block would get Bitcoin where it needs to be, but it doesn't even get us in the ballpark.

Is buying 500-1000 dollars going to make you rich overnight?  No.  But as you move forward maybe 20 dollars becomes not a lot to you.  Maybe 50 or 100.

Your BTC is not vulnerable.  
When you claim your Bcash your BTG, BCD and other shit coin forks are vulnerable... who gives a shit.
After you've moved your btrash to an exchange then you work on BTG ... BCD is vulnerable and bitcore and whatever..
Move BTG that to an exchange etc. etc. etc. 
Now you work on BCD and  now your bitcore is vulnerable which is like .00000001% of the value of your BTC at this point if you can even fucking sell it (Do you really care?  Is it even worth your time? Probably not) 
Guess what you're vulnerable on the exchange. OH NO!!!
The only "secure" way to do this ... You stupid fuck.  Would be to sign all your transactions offline.

Yes I remember it dipping a few times when we went through a logarithmic growth period (when we went from GPUs to ASICs) and when ASICs become out classed to the point they are no longer profitable.  
So you build up a large fleet of these miners and then you put out a new miner and ship it to thousands of people and overnight they just crush the profitability of the older gen miners.  Many of them fall out and you get a dip for a little bit until the next batch or two come out and then you go higher.

Private tyranny is slavery.  No more no less.  Slavery cannot exist where people are voluntarily interacting with one another.  I reject your claim that corporations are examples of private tyranny.  
A corporation that has people voluntarily choose to come work for them over working for other corporations/companies or for themselves is not a form of slavery.  
Your ideology is not libertarian and I'd kindly ask you to refrain from misusing it in the future.  Libertarians support and encourage freedom of association.  Libertarians support the free market.
I welcome Microsoft to contribute to Bitcoin despite my doubts they will be successful perhaps their efforts can contribute something to the community.
Personally I'm rather wary of any company/corporation having anything to do with my identity and I will most likely refrain from participating in their network unless it proves to be something altruistic in nature.  
Oh my .. I'm not being forced to use their product *shock* ... what tyranny.  /s

You only need to move your BTC once you stupid shit.  
BTC goes into 1 address.  let's say 1F1tAaz5x1HUXrCNLbtMDqcw6o5GNn4xqX
THE FORK OCCURS.
You move the BTC from 
To 3PAWciupL9ttkAf5amBL2R2GazADCpQm4z (this is hypothetical, don't actually fucking move any BTC to this address, yes I needed to say that because yes you are that fucking dumb) 
because you're a good little boy and you like segwit.
Then your BTC is secure.  You never move your BTC back to 
1F1tAaz5x1HUXrCNLbtMDqcw6o5GNn4xqX EVER.
Then you move your Bcash from
To an exchange to sell it
Then you move your bitcoin gold from
To an exchange to sell it
Then you move your bitcore from
To an exchange to sell it
Then you move your bitcoin diamond from 
To an exchange to sell it
Then with all your new found BTC you move it all back to

There is central leadership but it's amorphic and voluntary.  You'll never see a central authority own Bitcoin.  The difference being leader's have people follow them on a voluntary basis.  If there was an owner they can do whatever they want with it.  This is why Satoshi went away.  His word carried too much influence over people who can't understand what is and isn't good for Bitcoin without an awful lot of education on computer science, game theory and economics.

So first off that would need to be 1 actor and not a pool.  Spy mining would prevent them from effectively doing this attack. 
So basically someone would need to first ... acquire the hashing power to get 51% ..  If they are collecting the rewards people would know that there is a risk against the integrity of the network ...  It would be known and people would take counter measures against it.   
If they are not they are spending an awful lot of energy for no reward for a long time.  They would then need to wait until they can effectively get 6+ confirmations ahead... this will take some time.  Imagine essentially flipping a coin until you get it to go your way 6 times... (or they would need to increase their % of the hash rate even more) 
Then they would need to drop all 6 ... at which point the community could react and go along the non-attacked fork.

I disagree you can totally have a blockchain without a token.  What matters is the PoW behind it (because to date is no other secure decentralized consensus mechanism).  
If the immutability of the data is valuable enough then the expenditure it could be justified for interested parties. 
The problem is you're not going to get a more secure blockchain than what Bitcoin has to offer.  Without a significant PoW network securing the blockchain it's as you said a database secured by a central authority AKA less than worthless since a database is preferable to a blockchain for every use case except a secure decentralized immutable store of data.

Let's say I write and essay and I put the hash of the essay in the Bitcoin blockchain.  That is evidence that I had possession of the document prior to it's acceptance in the blockchain.  It's irrefutable based on math and physics.  There exists nothing on earth that can write to the bitcoin blockchain but the bitcoin network.  Bitcoin cash for example cannot say the same. 
If a company puts their access times to a building in a blockchain that is not secured by proof of work.  It is not an immutable store of data.  There is no reason to believe that the blockchain wasn't rewritten in a matter of seconds to add or eliminate data.  
So where you use the word secure ... it means nothing.  The blockchain is immutable and writing to it is secure because nothing but the Bitcoin network can write to it.

Move your coins to the segwit address.  This way if fees go up in the future you get cheaper access and you can put your BTC straight into the LN network.

Roger Ver and the Bcash cronnies are paying people to shill in r/btc  Go over there and spend some time.  You'll find that many of them only spend time in and look at their history.  You'll find a lot of them have like 5 year accounts with like a 3 year gap.  
Roger Ver is a very vocal public figure.  The devs are not so charismatic and their job isn't to debate Roger Ver their job is to work on code.   
The 95%/35% thing cracks me up.  You can go on a website make an ERC20 token for 5 bucks .. maybe 1 trillion of them and buy it from yourself for a dollar and BOOM you're the largest market cap in crypto.  It doesn't mean anything because there is no liquidity.  Case in point.  Look how all the alts are reacting to Bitcoin's movement.  Bitcoin goes up the marketcap goes up etc.  Ripple made that guy the richest man in the world.. wtf? Good luck trying to cash out of ripple at 3 dollars lol.  
Roger is making his play with his coin and it's failing.  The market is demonstrating that.  Look at its' price compared to bitcoin since it was launched.  
On a technical level no one refutes that the block size will need to be increased.  All the Bitcoin Core team is optimizing our use of the block size so that when we do increase the block size we get the most bang for buck.  Bitcoin is still very small.  People who are into bitcoin now are more bleeding edge than the rest of the population.  Blockchain doesn't scale .. this is why Bitcoin and Ethereum are looking for solutions.  The lightning network is really awesome and I'm very excited about it.
I really hate Roger Ver for the mental stress he caused me for looking into this debate.  However at the end of the day this political attack on Bitcoin will be very good for us.  It's making Bitcoin stronger and my confidence has never been stronger.

Well most cryptos don't use the same algorithm so they don' have to worry about Bitcoin's network for example. 
1.  The threat of a 51% attack is really exaggerated.  
2.  Bitcoin could do it with Bcash, but then we'd suffer slower blocktimes 
3.  You give them credibility to a certain extent the additional network increase may be seen as legitimacy in the eyes of some people and put money into it.
4.  You're going to be operating at a financial loss. 
In other words you're going to be sacrificing a lot in terms and there is literally no way to ROI on that shit.  
When I sold my btrash it was .18 compared to BTC... before that it was .20... now many alts have bounced back with Bitcoin... not Btrash... still sitting at .12 when if it were to bounce back it would be at .13 or .14 ...

I fucking humor you and take the time to present many legitimate cases... and you respond with this low effort bull shit.  
This is precisely why this subreddit is moderated.  You're wasting our fucking time.  The reason why LN and segwit took so long was because the Devs respect the decentralized nature of Bitcoin and they just decided to move on when it became clear that Bcash was an attempt to centralize and control Bitcoin.  We use many techniques in their all holy graphene already and graphene doesn't offer substantial performance improvements in real world test scenarios. 
How did they change Bitcoin?  By fixing malleability so we can have safer smart contracts?  You don't need segwit to do lightning.  Segwit just allows the possibility to do smart contracts in a safer manner.
LN doesn't change Bitcoin LN is built on top of bitcoin.

That is correct.  Crypto currencies are most certainly the culprit of the shortage.  It's very profitable to make a computer with 4-6 GPUs and run them to mine coins like Monero for example.  
However with Bitcoin we use entirely different chips which have nothing to do with GPUs or anything that Nvidia or AMD currently makes.  
These alt coins are hit or miss.  If they had legitimate long term purpose then someone would make ASICs for them.  However it's a gamble for AMD or nVidia to put any effort behind any coin other than Bitcoin.  It would also be a gamble for them to ramp up production and be caught holding the bags when/if the altcoin market dries up like it did from 2013-mid 2017ish.

You miss the point.  The point is that adding to the block size makes Bitcoin less fluid.  You raise the barrier to entry in becoming a full node on the network.  Bitcoin shouldn't be centralized to just 1000 nodes or just 10000 nodes.  It's designed to be an amorphic system.
Instead we're doing things like segwit which if everyone uses segit that's a 4mb blocksize increase and schnoor and MAST to make improvements to bitcoin so that when we do increase the weighted blocksize we get more bang for buck per mb we add.

The link I gave you made everything very simple. Literally you just cut and paste the commands into a console and wait.  It takes a long time.  Like it will probably take half a day to get it installed (you don't need to watch it all that time of course).  
Then you'll need a few weeks to download the entire blockchain if you don't download it from another source. 
Really it's easy peasy.

Anyone for GPU mining is a fucking moron.  
If it's profitable and possible it will be done.  Anything you can do with software can be done faster in hardware. In other words if you make a coin it's asic resistance is in reality it's worthlessness.  As it appreciates in  value the asic resistance erodes away.  It's inevitable.

The alt coins.  Bitcoins have SHA256 ASICs working to secure the network not GPUs.   The best graphics card maybe does what 2GH/s (that's being fairly generous)? The best ASIC does 14 TH/s.  
The bitcoin network is like EH/s.
Mining bitcoin with a GPU is like digging a foundation for a house with a plastic spoon.  Actually it's probably significantly more pointless than that analogy... Lets go with digging the pacific ocean with a table spoon.

Are you a dev on the project?  I'm trying to catch up with what's going on.  What you're saying doesn't make sense to me. 


You don't need a static IP to be part of a decentralized network.  You can drop off and pop back on the network as needed.  You could potentially even leverage the bitcoin network to announce yourself if you changed IPs.  


Why would you need a foreground process? You could have a background process do it.  One big complication for LN is some wallets are behind NATs so in order to establish a connection they need to reach out of from behind the NAT.  So you'd have a difficult time getting 2 phones to be channeled together without leveraging the Bitcoin network somehow (probably a good idea) 


A user isn't going to open a channel send fund and close it... that's horribly inefficient.  I thought the idea was you'd be running a lightning node then the node would open channels inside the network and you'd want the node to be on as much as possible to sign transactions and keep the channels open to avoid closing on the blockchain.
Do you mean in the future you expect that nodes would run people's channels for them?  That doesn't sound like a trustless system.

Yeah the reason why this sub is moderated is so that the people that actually believe in Bitcoin and want to see it remain decentralized and not owned by anyone ... so that we have a voice.  
You can go over and see how that unmoderated sub was taken over by the alt-right white nationalist crowd over the past couple years.  The real community there moved over to which is a moderated sub.

So the reason why Bitcoin needed to have a token that could increase in value is because profit is a universal way to raise a group of people to donate time and resources. Since Bitcoin is completely decentralized it's probably the only way to accomplish it.
Nothing stops a company or group of companies from running a blockchain and putting hashing power behind it, but what is gained by doing this?  In my opinion not a whole lot.

No shit.. putting your private keys in a hot wallet is always riskier than a hardware wallet or cold storage.  No shit putting your private keys in software you don't fully trust is even riskier. 
(prefork) move your coin into separate addresses with at least one address containing a small amount of BTC.  Use this small amount to test your process prior to moving larger amounts. 
 
First you move your BTC to a new address.
Then you move your forks to an exchange where you can sell the fork in the order of greatest trust to least trust of the wallets.  If your trust is 0 simply go from greatest value to least value.  
@_date: 2018-02-15 15:26:09
So it works like this.
Block is found.
Mining pool constructs a block by putting transactions in a merkle tree with each transaction hash linked to another one which all eventually end up being hashed against the header which includes the previous blocks hash.
Then they hash the header only quadrillion of times a second until they find a hash with a certain number of leading 0's depending on the difficulty. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 15:58:53
Why waste your time?  The reality of the matter is Bitcoin is money.  Money doesn't need to be backed by anything anymore.  It's simply a mechanism for humans to communicate and transmit value with. 
I am not aware of any major country that has their "money" backed by anything.  Maybe just their military might.  
According to this I'd say that Bitcoin is an improved version of Fiat.  It takes the aspects of Fiat that are good and combines them with the aspects of Gold.  
It has all the qualities of money and improves upon them in most instances.  For example bitcoin has better durability, perhaps on par portability, great divisibility, great uniformity, fixed limited supply, it's not as good in terms of acceptability but that's improving.  
Bitcoin isn't just a replacement for currency as we know it today.  It renders many banking services obsolete.   Safe storage, fraud protection, transportation etc.  
For certain use cases traditional Fiat might be a superior financial tool.

The way you make it sound doesn't make any sense.  You need to know the address in order to sign a transaction before broadcasting it or sending it to bitpay so that they can send it.  
bitpay can't modify the address after you've signed the transaction. If that were the case bitcoin wouldn't be where it is today.

Is this a time traveler's thing or something?
@_date: 2018-02-28 17:14:13
So what got people interested myself include in Bitcoin is the fact that it is not centralized.  Meaning that it is not controlled by any one correlated group or class of people.  It's a permissionless system.   If you want to run a node you can do it.  If you want to add code to Bitcoin you can do it (might not get used of course) and if you want to mine you can do it.
The vision for Bitcoin is to be a global financial system capable of competing with the network of central banks today. 
For this to be a reality Bitcoin needs to be flexible and it needs small blocks to do this.
We want it to be relatively inexpensive to run a node.  Why? Because you absolutely MUST run a node in order to run a mining pool.  If it requires weeks worth of setup and expensive hardware to setup a mining pool then the leading mining pools have little threat.  Low barriers to entry resist mining pool monopolization which is desperately needed. 
If Bitcoin were under attack or the internet was under attack.  Being able to run Bitcoin over satellites or RF mesh nets is important and the bandwidth available on those types of networks are not comparable to the bandwidth on the internet right now.  TOR is another important tool that would be necessary in order to keep bitcoin resistant to censorship and TOR isn't known for its speed/bandwidth capabilities.
At this point we don't have the ability to scale a blockchain to the point where Bitcoin could be a financial system capable of competing with the central bank network.  We can optimize the block size use (which is what we're doing)... but even if we can get 100 tx per second for 1MB of blocksize space which is more than an order of magnitude increase in efficiency we'd need about 250 MB to compete with VISA and 250 MB over satellites, Tor, or meshnets isn't going to work well on a global scale in the next 10 years and there is a very real chance Bitcoin could see an insane adoption over the next 10-20 years. 
Keeping the blocksize at 1 MB does offer some control over what you're talking about.  We still need to have on chain transactions and they serve their own valuable usecase.  However not every transaction needs to be on the blockchain.  The blockchain facilitates payment channels and the lightning network.  It's a set of compression of the transactions.  
LN allows Bitcoin to scale quickly.  LN allows instant trustless payments.  Now is the time to do this and dial it in.  Over the past 3 months we saw that fees can easily rise to the price greater than the current blocksize reward.
As Bitcoin continues to grow in price and adoption continues you'll see that miners are well compensated as well as they ever were with the smaller block rewards. thoughts?
@_date: 2018-02-12 14:17:34


I don't follow you here.  He's not adding anything to the supply he's just saying we change the way we speak about Bitcoin.  1 Bitcoin would still be what we consider 1 Bitcoin today.

Well it depends on your perspective of certain things that he's supported.  
On the one hand supporting gun control can be viewed as good and righteous by some people while being down right evil by others.  The spirt of gun control is ultimately to save lives, and the spirt of gun rights is ultimately to save lives.  The disagreement comes in the form of the approach in achieving the goals.
Bill Gates has also supported Monsanto which if you like their super fertile crops that's awesome and wanting to feed the world that's great, but obviously they are controversial.  Ignoring the GMO's will make you into a mutant stuff I think it's fair to raise concerns about how certain seeds might spread and mix with other more native seeds and if they aren't fertile what that might do to the future of agriculture on a global scale.
These are the two biggest examples aside from the vaccine thing which I'm ignoring because I think that criticism is stupid.   However, depending on where you fall on these issues Bill Gates could be a saint, misguided, or bond villain.

Bitcoin isn't a currency it's an entire financial system.  
It's more secure more private faster than the current banking system.
I don't think it replaces Fiat but its great competition.  Credit cards are better for untrusted merchants.   Bitcoin is better for everything else.
@_date: 2018-02-19 16:52:28
I disagree.  The fact that the ledger and the trezor both have screens make them superior to this.   It helps eliminate the possibility that the address presented to the user on the computer is not the same as the one being signed.  A device designed for security this is a notable and unforgivable absence. 
The SD backup is also inferior compared to the 12-24 word keyword back up.  It's trivial to put the 12-24 word keyword in a fire proof backup like cryptosteel.  This solution is only viable for pocket cash ... and so is your phone. 
As far as I am concerned this is a complete waste of money.  If you can't afford the extra 40 euro for a proper hardware wallet then you're better off waiting and keeping your crypto on a device that is kept entirely offline.  An old phone or laptop .. hell a raspberry pi.  
Then you can invest in something like cryptosteel .. and graduate to the hardware wallet down the line.

You should only put into bitcoin what you would be absolutely willing to lose.  This allows you to have the unreasonable mindset needed to succeed as a hodler.  
I think in 4-5 years you'll look back and deeply regret selling.  
Moving forward if you still like Bitcoin you can look into dollar cost averaging.  DecentralizedTv on youtube I think is great the guy is doing some DCAs with some alts, but the guy already has a lot of bitcoin he is hodling.  So maybe consider DCAing Bitcoin for a while.  These corrections happen. 
Bitcoin has blossomed very nicely over the past 4-5 years.  The core fundamentals it was founded upon are very strong.  There is still room for improvement.   We have a viable scaling solution .. .I've never been so confident or excited about Bitcoin before.

You can't simply round to the nearest satoshi when you close the channel.   When you have a signed transaction from your counter party in the channel you cannot alter any aspect of the transaction without invalidating the hash AKA making it entirely worthless.  It's the fundamental principle that this entire system is built upon.  
I see.  It makes sense that it just rounds down.  This probably helps with fees and such.  The transactions you exchange that can be broadcast are in satoshis and on paper (in lightning) you just have a balance you understand as being smaller than a satoshi.

I think you misunderstand the point of Bitcoin.  Bitcoin was designed to upset and disrupt businesses, banks, and governments.  This is precisely why we shouldn't give a fuck whether or not we burn bridges.  MtGox failed.  Coinbase can fail and Bitcoin will move on.  I'd rather see this project fail entirely then see it gain mass adoption and fail to effect change on global society in a meaningful way. 
Its very dangerous in many ways.   
1.  It introduces the concept that a nation state doesn't need to run a monetary system. 
2.  It introduces the concept that a "company" doesn't need to be owned or ran by anyone.  Bitcoin is an entire financial system that is an attractive competitor to the central banking system. 
3.  It's a huge step forward for individual financial privacy.  Civil Asset Forfeiture is less relevant if the Bitcoin is stored properly.  To that end taxes in many respects are kind of optional.  Particularly when/if privacy is introduced into the base layer.  When you die the government just can't raid your bank accounts.  They can't freeze your Bitcoin.  
4.  When DAOs are properly implemented it will flip the false dichotomy of capitalism vs communism on its head.  
To dive into this deeper.  Capitalism is the idea that individuals can own property and contract with others freely to exchange goods and services.  If you build a business you own it and can profit from it.  You get to compete against other companies and so on and so forth.  It's a good system in many respects.  
Socialism/Communism as an economic platform is the idea that companies are collectively owned.  On a micro scale the idea isn't bad, but the reality of the matter is these companies don't scale well and have a hard time competing with their more focused capitalist counterparts.  When you push this to the macro scale and view a country as communist you see a lot of violence, suffering, and oppression. 
Now we introduce a system where people who would fit in an organization as an employee can replace their manager with machines.  Not for every business model of course (at least not yet) but many very common popular and useful business models can be adopted to the platform and ran on lightweight machines by the "employees" and they are paid P2P by the customers.  
No more payroll, No more HR, no more managers, no owners or share holders.  Just a protocol. 
Finally it now provides a method in which countries may have ways around sanctions.

Well you realize that a significant amount of hardware would be required to run a mining pool with gigabyte or terabyte blocks  
By having an expensive barrier to entry in being able to run a full node it would mean that running a mining pool would be more costly and fewer people could do it.  Especially the bandwidth costs small pools couldn't survive.
Having the ability for someone to spin up a new mining pool up in a short period of time is crucial to Bitcoin remaining decentralized.
Not to mention bitcoin cash has no fix for covert ASIC boost which is a real problem since bitmain has a patent on it.  Covert ASIC boost is a far more effective than overt ASIC boost.  Even if they opened up the patent it'd still be bad for the bitcoin cash blockchain.

If you don't understand something you should ask instead of removing all doubt that you're an idiot.
Of course ASICs have had a tremendous impact on the size of the bitcoin blockchain. You see when there is tremendous growth in hashing power.  Blocks are produced faster until the adjustment takes place.  
So if I'm estimating how much space bitcoin will add to it's blockchain in the next month and we're doing blocks every 5 minutes instead of the targeted 10 minutes.  We're going to add more blocks in during that time period and as a result use more space.
Now gone are the days when ASICs were really pushing the hashing rate up faster than the adjustments could handle, but it is still possible for us to miss the mark a bit and as such it's prudent to add some padding in when planning for 2 years.

Most wallets will use your computer and a pseudo random number generator to come up with your seed.  You'll want to back that seed up.  It's a list of 12 or 24 words that follows the BIP39 standard.  
You could use a set of fair dice to generate your key or add entropy to your key.  
So long as you have those 12-24 words you'll be able to use a tool like [this]( to recover your private keys.  
So then it's a matter of using a computer that never touches the internet or a hardware wallet (the same concept).  To keep your keys safe. 
You can also consider something like cryptosteel to store your seed in a fire resistant matter. 
Personally I treat my phone like it's my wallet in my pocket.  Never anymore than a couple hundred dollars on there.
Then you can use a hardware wallet for coins you're going to hodl for mid-term.
Then you can do straight cold storage where your key is generated offline with added entropy etc.  Then you back up the see in cryptosteel maybe encrypt it and put it on a few USB keys (encrypted of course) and distribute them across the world. 
You do this properly and if all your shit is seized you'll still have access to your crypto and the state can't confiscate it.

I dismissed your comments and this post was downvoted because it's been discussed many times (it is 5 years old).  With the financial incentive behind bitcoin you can assume it's either not a problem or it was fixed.

lol no.  While Bitcoin is volatile and continuing to rapidly increase in value.  People will either accept salary in BTC @ fiat rate.  Do one time jobs in BTC.  No company would set their employee's salary at a fixed BTC rate as btc becomes harder and harder to come across.  
If they did the contract would be negotiated for less and less btc overtime or the company would simply fire the person.  
This is how it works today.  If you're job commands 6 figures today, but 5 years from now your field is over saturated (the supply increased) your value goes down.  They are going to fire you and hire someone cheaper.

I disagree.  Everything on a blockchain needs to be verifiable that means you're in an enclosed ecosystem like AOL. AOL obviously failed and the internet and it's open system won.  
Having a turing complete crypto was sold as AWS on the blockchain and decentralized.  It didn't turn out that way because of the issue above.  It's been running for a few years and nothing worthwhile has come from it.  There isn't anything built upon ethereum that wouldn't be better in it's own blockchain aside from one hit wonders and scams. 
Smart contracts that are useful are monetarily focused and simple.  
It's better to have separate systems interact over the bitcoin blockchain or lightning network.  A lot less risk this way.  Bitcoin can focus on being the best Bitcoin without worrying about supporting all the other baggage.  
Not to mention the blockchain size of ethereum is absurd.  
You're taking something that is highly valuable and exposing it to a lot of risks with really no benefit in return.

There are no solutions and there never will be any solutions that "you can't lose".  This is an impossible requirement nothing can provide that absolute level of security.  You can only make it so that it's highly unlikely you'd lose your stuff.  Even the central banking system doesn't offer this to you.  
When you're using your bitcoin you should resist re-using your addresses keys.  A seed is a key to many private keys.  This way you are free to store 12-24 words.  Use bitcoin properly where you're not re-using your addresses.  You can use electrum and sign your transactions offline with another computer using your master public key.    So either you print out and store 1000 private keys or 12-24 words.

No you're just dumb.  Yes we need to let the ASIC market grow and flourish, but ASIC are always inevitability.  Anything that can be done with a program can have an ASIC made for it.  ASIC resistant algorithms like scrypt and cryptonight have failed.  Bluffing that you're going to a PoS chain, like Eth did,  has failed.  Threatening to change algos has failed.
Newsflash kiddo.  There are only so many PoW algos we can use. 
PoS simply doesn't work.  You don't know the purpose of Bitcoin.   


Bitch where?  The market is a shitshow.  Ripple is centralized Eth is stupid the best thing built on it was crypto kitties.  Nano and IOTA are centrally controlled lol I mean they didn't even solve the initial thing that made Bitcoin great.  Monero and LTC are cool, but they don't hold a candle to Bitcoin.  Monero's tx are too large and the community is silly for forking compromising their privacy and delaying the inevitable rather than pushing for their coin to have asics be distributed. 
Bitcoin is a global financial system and it doesn't hold a candle to the energy expenditure used by the central banking system.  
Here you are talking about Bitcoin getting rid of its nation state hardness and making it susceptible to either the next guy with a huge botnet or the NSA.

No I fucking hate Btrash.  It's the anti-thesis Bitcoin was founded upon.  They literally want to hand over control of Bitcoin to governments, banks, and corps.  If that's the case I'll stick with the current central banking system.  
Their design methodology nessecairly will limit the flexiblity of Bitcoin to run on various mediums particularly TOR.  These are options we need open to us.  If a mining pool gets out of line it needs to be lightweight so that a competitive pool can be spun up anywhere in the world in a matter of minutes or hours.  Requiring access to an internet backbone and hardware that costs 10-100 bitcoins is unacceptable to run a node/mining pool.

I mean looking at your post history it just seems like this is your troll account.  LOL the issue between going from 10 - 5 minute blocks?  It doesn't matter ... As your blocks get shorter you get more chainsplits so it doesn't add any convenience or security.  2 5 minute blocks have the same value as 1 10 minute block and so on and so forth.  So if you're good with 2 10 minute blocks now you gotta wait for 4 5 minute blocks to have the same level of security.

When a miner mines a new block they get paid with a coinbase transaction.  It's a special type of transaction where they add the fees and block reward to any address they choose. 
There is a coinbase transaction in the genesis block.   So satoshi just picked an address for himself to get things started.  Later blocks can send bitcoin to the same address.
Lets say I do one now at block 561250 or whatever.  When you're going through and validating the blockchain from your perspective after validating the genesis block Satoshi's address will have just 50 BTC and when you finally validate my block you'll have the additional BTC I sent registered in Satoshi's address.

Well technically Bitcoin Cash isn't a fork of Bitcoin.  It's a fork of Bitcoin Clashic which is a true fork of Bitcoin.  While I don't care much for alts.

I'm doing a writeup on this now.  This is fucking awful. 
@_date: 2018-04-27 13:33:12
With 1mb blocks Bitcoin does on average 3-7 tx per second.  This is the result of the average tx size that can fit in a 1mb block and the target interval of 10 minutes.  
So there are 2 easy ways to scale bitcoin.  You can increase the blocksize or you can lower the block time.  
Lowering the blocktime sends the wrong message because then your transactions are less secure.  IE if you're waiting for 6 blocks normally then we drop to 5 minute blocks ... now you should wait 12 blocks.  It also grows the size of the blockchain faster, but that's not the end of the world.  
You could increase the blocksize as well.  So 2 mb would get you from 6-14 tx per second that's a linear progression.  
Now to understand the beef between BTC and BCH you must understand the fundamental principle that BTC was founded upon.  That is that everyone controls bitcoin and no one controls bitcoin.  What that means is Bitcoin must be beyond the control of any corporation or government.  PERIOD.  The second a country or group of countries can change the Bitcoin protocol with hashing power the experiment is over fuck it forget it lets start over and try again.  
With Bitcoin Cash supporters many of them like Craig Wright for example are perfectly fine with banks, governments, and corporations running Bitcoin.  
So the question is does increasing the blocksize necessarily lead towards centralization?  Well there are a few factors in play.  Hard disk space, bandwidth, and block validation/propagation.  
So the Bitcoin Core team doesn't unanimously reject a blocksize increase.  Segwit was a blocksize increase if you use segwit.  It also rendered cover ASICBoost (a real threat to Bitcoin) obsolete.  Not to mention fixing transaction malleability making Bitcoin safer for smart contracts and the lightning network.  
The Bitcoin Cash team has all of their money on just making the blocksize bigger and improving block propagation.  The reality of the matter is they can't really improve the block propagation efficiency the Bitcoin Core devs have pretty much beaten that horse to the ground already.  The only real way to improve it beyond it's current performance would be to restrict miners from excluding transactions in blocks and being very strict about the ordering of transactions.  Which when you think about it is a terrible idea for a number of reasons. 
So where do we want Bitcoin to be in the near future?  7000 tx per second?  50,000 tx per second?  This would require a gigabyte block or a terabyte block.  The fact of the matter is this would make running a mining pool extraordinarily expensive.  The days of being able to spin an emergency pool up in a couple hours would be long gone.  Small pools would be impossible to run without some sort of charity.   Forget just the hard disk space, but think about the network connections and processor speed required.  This is a no-go for anyone who wants Bitcoin to remain nationstate hard despite their apparent cautious approval of the new technology based financial  sector. 
We want Bitcoin to be able to be ran by people of modest means.  We want poor people to be able to run full nodes so they don't need to trust anyone or group of people on the network.  We want Bitcoin to be able to run over many mediums and not just fiber internet.  We want it to be able to run over radios and satellite networks which are probably decades away from catching up to the speeds we can get over fiber if they will ever catch up that is.  
So the question is really where do you stand on the politics of Bitcoin and crypto in general?  Personally I believe the only reason Crypto exists is because Bitcoin exists.  If Bitcoin falls everything else falls.  The only reason they are not attacking crypto now is because they realize they can't stop Bitcoin and taking a cautious welcoming approach to all of crypto is better for distribution (tricking people out of their Bitcoin) and why bother going after small fish if you can't take down the fish that matters.  
Technically speaking for bitcoin cash to grow it necessarily must become more centralized.  It will still be a distributed system, but centrally controlled like Ripple.  
The only reason the chain even exists today is because they permit covert ASICBoost.  If they were to find a way to solve covert ASICBoost the chain would die overnight because Jihan (bitmain) would stop mining it immediately.

Segwit was a blocksize increase to a theoretical max of about 4MB.  Basically we store the transaction data and separate the signatures of segwit blocks.  If the entire block is standard segwit transactions then it could get up to about 4MB.  
The blockweight is based on the transaction part of the block.  Segwit transactions are about 25% the size in the transaction part of the block so the fees are cheaper.
This was done as a transaction malleability fix.  Transaction malleability needed to be fixed so that we could have better more reliable smart contracts.  If your contract was dependent on a tx ID and another tx id could remove the funds you're counting on then you're in for a bad day.  It also allows for watchtower in lightning which is awesome. 
The real reason that the show runners of bitcoin cash Ver and Jihan object to segwit is because it makes covert ASICBOOST no longer covert and no longer really doable with blocks with segwit transactions.  
All of Roger's debates are more or less hand picked.  The guy that he went against at anarcopoco or whatever is a dash shill.  
[I think this is the video]( that got me to understand the whole "big block vs. small block" thing very well.  
The best big blocks can do is provide some temporary relief without significant centralization (consolidation of power).
Craig Wright explicitly said it would be great if bitcoin was ran by corps and governments.  In his talk he used the shifting sands approach.  It was a short talk 26 minutes but took a good hour or so to get through it and really dig into all his sudden changes in context and terminology.  For example most people think about Bitcoin and safe transactions when they are included in blocks and he was talking about zero conf tx for a lot of his talk but never explicitly said he was talking about zero conf so that's why Joesph Poon was like your entire talk made no sense.  He'd also conflate terms like packet, block, and transaction.  He only really went into la la land towards the end when he talked about lightning.   Bcashers talk about a routing problem that doesn't exist.  We have networks that route ... it's the internet ... we have TOR... Is it perfectly efficient perhaps not, but it doesn't matter.     Solving all the private keys in existence has nothing to do with routing.  His entire talk was designed to sound educational and have some verifiable aspects a non-technical person could verify against and get them to the point where they would feel they understand the topic, but in reality they have no fucking clue.
The bcashers are playing the same game that the Federalists played in the founding of the United States.  The Federalists took the name that meant distributed power (among the states), but really were for central authority.

The answer is ... it depends. 
If your coins are on coinbase you're not really using Bitcoin.  So if you want to learn and start using Bitcoin taking control of your bitcoin is a great way to start.
Depending on how much value you need to protect you're going to need to take different approaches.  If it's pocket change bitcoin you can have a wallet on your phone.  If it's a mid term hodl then maybe a hardware wallet.  If it's a long term hodl for lambos then you should consider offline HD wallet secured with fireproof manner.  
Some axioms for security are as follows. 
If it's convenient it's not secure.  
You need to measure your security based on your exposure and risk.  The higher the risk the more effort needs to be placed in mitigating exposure.  The more risk the more effort and steps you need to take in order to secure.
So which wallet and the approach you take to secure it varies depending on your intended use and how much you're securing.
If you're storing 10 bucks and want to buy a movie it's fine on your phone.  
If it's a few grand with a purchase here and there maybe a hardware wallet. 
If it's a few hundred grand you aren't touching for a few years multiple copies fire proof.
If it's a few million then you're talking some serious security measures.  Global distribution encrypted seeds destroyed computers fair dice entropy.
Not to mention after you get a few grand you really need to begin considering legitimate means of estate planning.  
Bitcoin takes a little bit of responsibility and effort.  That will ease a bit overtime, but it will never be as easy peasey as central banking.  There are other valuable advantages bitcoin offers which make the effort worth it.

Well their design path is on a one way path towards being centrally controlled which is the anti-thesis of the principles Bitcoin was founded upon.  
This is an attack on Bitcoin to flush out some fundamental principles Bitcoin needs to be based on.  It's an effort to improve the quality of community support.  It's an effort to trick people who don't really understand bitcoin into giving up their bitcoin and improve distribution.  Of course continuing to leverage covert asicboost for profit is a strong financial incentive behind Bitcoin Cash.

It's better to just let the network develop organically.  There is a cap currently on how much you can hold in a channel. 
The risk/reward ratio regarding hubs doesn't make sense to me.  LN is a place where you hold your pocket money.  Beyond that you're making yourself to valuable as a target.  
So if coinbase wanted to run a bunch of LN nodes to make money ... they would have to get the hardware to run lets say 10,000 nodes.  Then you need to secure those 10,000 nodes (4000 bitcoin).
Ideally you'd be running them in varying environments ... then you're constantly updating them for security flaws.  Honestly I'd go so far as to design custom hardware.  
Honestly I don't think the setup would be able to pay the recurring costs of staffing a top notch network security team to keep everything patched and up to date.  Much less be able to pay back the upfront initial investment.

It's not bias if it's based on fact.  


This isn't a matter of opinion.  Open minds aren't required.


Explain the routing issue to me. 
How is funding a channel an issue?  
Always online node requirement?  Why is that an issue?  When you want to pay for something with the central banking system the merchant needs to be online.  When you want to pay for something with Bitcoin the user needs to be online.  Don't see the problem for 99% of use cases.  
Maybe you don't understand the technology and that's fine.  I do .. and bitcoin cash needs to be centrally controlled if it is going to function at the scale we want Bitcoin to be at. 
@_date: 2018-04-28 02:19:09
I think lightning is a great solution.  The risk is only that people with large access to capital get more Bitcoin by running ln nodes.  This is a problem that inherently exists in any monetary system to date.  Really though the administration costs could be significant.  You'd need a team of top info sec guys monitoring the network for attacks since currently the private keys need to be on a device connected to the internet.
The issue I'm talking about has more tondo with the network topology.  SPV isn't a transaction type.  It's a method of validating transactions by asking a lot of nodes what they think.  It's a lot of back and forth.  This is why we have JavaScript a client side language so we can run operations locally rather than doing a round trip to the server.  It dramatically improves user experience and cuts down on bandwidth.  Not to mention the issues wireless networks have with filtering noise.  Many small packets carry with them more overhead and likelihood of failure.  This needs to be balanced with the larger packets failing less often but having to send more data when it does happen.  
I'm not sure but I believe that SPV requires TCP where much of the block propagation enhancements use UDP which is lighter weight than TCP.
It's eager loading vs. lazy loading.  I think eager loading would be better on a satellite network in a disaster situation.
@_date: 2018-04-20 05:18:47
So a blockchain is just a data structure.
It provides a method of storing data in a manner that A necessarily was created prior to B ... where B references the hash of A.
For example tracking packages and using a blockchain is not a bad idea.  The accepting employee signs the transaction with her Trezor and sends the package off to the depot.  The truck driver  and the accepting employee there signs it with their Trezor.  
Is it 1000% secure? Perhaps not, but a single package isn't the end of the world and provided the shipping company is efficient you can usually verify that it's highly unlikely that a chain was tampered with by the distances between stops and overlapping time schedules.  
This would be Proof of Travel.

Craig Wright said he thinks it would be great if banks and government ran Bitcoin.
Roger Ver said his reason for Bitcoin Cash is that we only get one chance to gain adoption and we can always change the system.
I deeply disagree with him here.  There are plenty of examples of products being introduced as flops and the next version or following versions gained mass adoption.  One notable example is Android.
If we gain mass adoption on a platform that can be centralized it will be very difficult for us to change to a decentralized system. Look how hard it was to soft fork segwit.  Right now Bitcoin is very small with mostly somewhat technical people in it.  When it gains real mainstream adoption and government and billions of people rely on it.  Changes will be very difficult and far more dangerous.  
I think it's prudent that we hold off pushing adoption until Bitcoin is more bulletproof no pun intended. 
I also question running large blocks over slow networks like TOR which I believe is a card we need to hold on to for the purpose of being nation state hard.
Also I think it is important for us to be able to run over satellite particularly for natural disasters like we saw in Puerto Rico.  We can't really rely on Bitcoin if it isn't easy to it up in an area with limited access to electricity.  You could do SPV clients but the bandwidth is really small so if too many people try to use it.  I think it would be better just to broadcast transactions and download new blocks then validate locally.  Both for security and functionality.  I think too many SPV requests could clog the satellite pipe like cell phone networks during an emergency.

It takes a considerable amount of money to be a validator.  Right 1000 eth if I recall correctly. 
I believe that we agree that the stalling of transactions would be problematic for the asset. 
This is an attack that can be done on POS and POW without breaking consensus rules.  Bitmain has published many empty blocks. Even if we were to make a rule no empty blocks they could just make their own transactions and it would result in the same outcome.
To carry out this attack on POW you're constantly expending energy to maintain your position as a "validator".  It's a substantial cost that must be carried out throughout the attack.
To carry out this attack on POS you simply need to have the status of the validator.  Now the "protection" here is that you're hurting the asset.  However in the real world you can profit substantially if you know the direction an asset is going to go.  You can short it.  You can sell calls.  You can buy a puts.
So the difference of having to expend a resource external to the system actually has a profound effect on the security of the network.   POS is less secure than POW.

So realistically to do some real damage you'd need something like 60-70%.  That hashrate is working on BTC right now.  You'd have to take an awful lot of hash power off of the BTC side fairly slowly.  That means a lot lost income potential.  Then you'd need to throw an awful lot of power at it... and you couldn't have too many players working on this because if word got out things could be done to deal with it.
Then you'd have to mine silently for a long time.. enter your shorts ... and rewrite a lot of blocks.  
It could take a few days they could fix it... they might already have code to fix this sort of thing quickly.   Confidence could be shattered.  Nice money on a short ... but would you be able to take the money out?

Right.  So if there are 2 block 5's one accepted by the soft fork and the other is not then one of them will be longer than the other.  So if the original chain gets so far ahead of the softfork chain then the soft fork miners will run up against economic pressures because they are mining on essentially a dead chain.  However if the soft fork chain becomes longer it will be accepted by the network.  
So let's say at block 5 we start a soft fork.  So Block 6 is found with the original rules and you wait longer for a block 6 with the soft fork rules.  Then the soft fork chain will die.  Otherwise you're forcing a hardfork because you're forcing another chain.  The problem is you need hashing power behind the hard fork.
You can have 2 or more "valid" new blocks exist at the same time.  The chain that is built upon first/longest will be the winner.  this is where the 6 block confirmations thing comes from because after 6 blocks it is statistically improbable it will be over taken by another competing chain.

You want a more civil tone then you stay away from the logical fallacies.  
It's an underhanded dishonest tactic to win an argument to win the favor of public opinion.  At the end of the day it's worthless. It proves nothing.  It's a waste of time for people who are trying to educate people.  It's a waste of time for people trying to learn.  It's potentially a waste of money for people trying to get into crypto.  
This is why this subreddit is moderated of as the loons over at would say censored.  If we were not moderated we'd be overrun by the nonsense garbage over there.  Organic movements can't be supported against a sibyl attack of funded fudsters.  We have jobs... trolling IS THEIR JOB.

Transaction spamming costs money because as you said theoretically the validator cannot know ahead of time whether they will be chosen or not.  (For the purposes of this conversation let's assume this is accurate even though I do not accept it).  So fees would be paid for spamming.  
So yes we are talking less secure.  We'd have to put that into the numbers of how many validators would you need to have in order to be nation state secure.  This is a global asset.  Is this decrease in security acceptable?  
Would you like to move on now to the stake grinding?  This is where we would discuss whether or not the validator could not possibly know the next validator to be chosen.

You're a bad human being.  I don't mean like you're evil. I mean you're defective.  Like you provide no value to humanity.  Dare I say your very existence hurts our race and threatens all future generations to come.
Comparing gold to bitcoin as a store of value.  One is mature for thousands of years.  One is 10 years old.  
To put it another way.  You're comparing a market where the participants are already inflated to one that is still empty.
You're not recognizing the fact that gold is being inflated.  In some reserves the same gold is sold many many times.
If you have real gold if and when there is a real global audit of these reserves then you will see the price skyrocket.
This is why bitcoin is so interesting.  Could the same thing happen?  Sure and I'm sure it has and is happening to some degree.  However the comparative ease if safe storage, transport, and durability of bitcoin when compared to gold means we no longer have to rely on institutions to safeguard our wealth.

No we do need both currently.  LN still settles on the blockchain.   Bitcoin is very small.  If we were to enter real mass adoption just ln channels opening and closing could be enough to overwhelm the blockchain and increase fees to an unacceptable amount.

Okay any source on that? I'm hearing varying results.  


What the fuck does the interface have to do with how blocks are found? 


What's your point?  Greg Maxwell did a presentation on work that he did and many of the optimizations that are in Graphene such as not sending transaction data to nodes when they propagate blocks because they most likely already have the transaction data is done.  
As I said for graphene to actually work you need to have a structured method of how transactions fit into blocks and where they go.  The performance difference isn't that significant according to Maxwell in his testing.  We're talking about a distributed system on a globe with varying specs on the machines.  Different bandwidth, pinging, processing power.  These blocks and transactions need to be hashed and validated before they are passed on to prevent spamming the network. 
10x .. okay so 100 MB for visa and 100 gigs for world... neither are working on TOR anytime soon.  
I'm not talking about Raspberry Pi I didn't mention Raspberry Pi why the fuck are you bringing up Raspberry Pi... you can barely run a bitcoin node on a raspbrery pi as is ... Without downloading the blockchain on a hard drive on a normal computer with good processing power you're waiting what 1.5 months 2 months to get your raspberry pi running and that's without the extra indexing needed to run lightning. 
I'm talking about TOR ... what censorship resident money isn't capable of being ran over the most censorship resident network... doesn't seem like that makes sense to me.  


I'm talking about being nimble in terms of being able to respond to an attack.  What is this horse shit red herring all about?  As lightning grows you wont need to close and open your channels all the time and I'm not saying we need to stay at 1mb forever it's simply something that needs to be done to maintain not only the ability to respond to threats to the network but also to keep the balance of power between the different actors in Bitcoin.  The users, miners, and devs.

Now who is the one making wild.accusations without proof. I know the bitcoin team has done amazing work on compression..
 Explain to me how they are going to have data in the blockchain but not take up space.


God you act like a fucking child.   What you theoretically do and what you can actually do is not the same.  Resources are limited and there for nothing is infinitely scalable.  It's kinda the entire premise of how we can secure data with cryptography.  You know.. numbers so large you'll consume all the energy in the universe before finding the answer.  
With 7+ billion people using a network it's not unreasonable to expect to see channel closing 50 channels per second.  This is well beyond the limitations of the bitcoin blockchain.
I love lightning.  I hate btrash.. but seriously you're the reason why the market is down.  You spout a bunch of shit and haven't got a clue what your talking about.

@_date: 2019-05-28 17:10:02
Very interesting indeed.  Thanks for sharing.  I looked into it a bit more and really what we're discussing is what a normal person would pay for a transaction to be included in the next block.  The peak of 5 dollars is not accurate as this metric doesn't take into account the size of the transactions.  A bulk transaction is going to have a larger fee since it takes more space on the blockchain.
When you look at the average sats per byte and take a normal transaction size youll see the max is about 3.4 dollars still very high.  Segwit would drop that fee to 1.90 
Of course you really don't need to have it in the next block.  You can still do low priority transactions for a cheaper fee.  
Now I think it's only fair to compare the value of a Bitcoin transaction vs a Bitcoin cash transaction.  Since bitcoin cash's network is mining at about 5% of Bitcoin's it really takes 20 blocks on bitcoin cash to offer the same security as a single block from bitcoin's network.
I wonder what the fee required to get a segwit transaction through in the samw timeframe would cost.  
Id also be interested to see what the average tx would be if we counted lightning transactions into the mix.

Bitcoin devs support both.   bcash does not.
Segwit was a blocksize increase to a max of 3
8 mb, that also addressed Malleability, that also rendered covert ASIC boost obselete which brought competition in the ASIC manufacturing space.
3 great things.  One of which is required for lightning (which being frank roger hasn't always been "cool" with it.  He was skeptical his position was if it works great but its unproven.  
When its more established he would possibly like to see it on btrash but as of yet I don't hear of a Malleability fix on btrash.  If they do segwit the fix it will decimate the chain because it would no longer enjoy jihans hashing power.  No covert asicboost.
Its a 2nd layer you don't have to use it. And it can die gracefully if it fails or something better comes.
To date I've heard nothing from the btrash community regarding off chain scaling.  No credible malleability fix.  No real way to support absurd blocksizes. Care to enlighten me?  
@_date: 2018-12-05 21:28:49
Now I know you're a fucking idiot.  Yes you can make a bitcoin  transaction to open up 10 lightning channels on the current Bitcoin network.   Just like you can pay 10 addresses... or pay 10 addresses to 10 address in one bitcoin transaction.  
However The more addresses you involve the LARGER the bitcoin transaction.  The more space it takes up in the block. The more space it takes up in the block the more bitcoin will be required to get it put into a block in a timely manner if at all.  
So no you cannot open a million lightning channels with 1 bitcoin transaction because that would far exceed the 3.8 mb theoretical limit with Segwit.  
[here]( go try it for yourself.  1 input with 1,000,000 outputs I got about 34 megabytes... NOT FITTING IN A BLOCK.

@_date: 2019-05-09 08:19:31
So there was a thread that was rudely moderated.  I asked a question.  You gave me ETH, XRP, and XLM.  I said one or two alt coins... It's not surprising that someone who thinks altcoins are anything but frauds would have such difficulty with simple directions.
Ethereum... The solution to Bitcoin's energy crisis.  Wait.. what? It's not?  You can't host a website on eth?  Shocking /s.  Yeah that's how it was originally sold.. bitcoin mining is wasteful because there is no value to solving SHA256 outside of securing the blockchain. 
Well it didn't end up like that.  You see today in 2019 what makes computer programs valuable is that they have the ability to communicate with other computers.  We are no longer limited to what is on our computer. 
The thing with a blockchain is that everything must be verifiable.  That means that you cannot include an external resource in your script.  You can't check the news.  You can't check the price of Bitcoin.  5 years from now when those pages go down .. or blocked... the blockchain is then in a state where it's validity cannot be validated. 
This means that the only data you can manipulate with a scripting language on a blockchain is the blockchain.  With such a limited set of data there is no need to introduce loops and a turing complete language.  A Stack language is a great choice.  You can do anything you need to do with it.  
Case in point.  There isn't a single worth while token on ETH.  this is why despite how many thousands of tokens are on ETH ... it's  it's not the backbone of Crypto.  Bitcoin is.  
Finally the fact that they are considering going to proof of stake is plainly sad.  Ethereum's purpose is to teach crypto what not to do.  
XRP.  It's not a crypto nor a competitor to bitcoin.  It's owned by a company.  It's a competitor to swift I guess.  It's not a crypto currency.  Everything is validated by Ripple.  Government says jump they say .. how high?

Items are priced in the local currency and the price can be translated into Bitcoin at the Point of Sale.  If you want to use Bits you can... the issue with pricing things in bitcoin now is that the market is very much in it's infancy and can grow.  
Bitcoin will go to 100,000 ... no I wont stop.  It's stupid to think that it wont.  As more people enter the market there are less bitcoin per person to go around.  Bitcoin did a 5x increase in 2013 from previous ATH... In 2017 it did a 20X increase for all time high.  If bitcoin repeats that insanity then maybe bitcoin will be 1,000,000 in the next market cycle (don't think it will necessarily, but I see how that eat his dick guy got to his number)  
So Bitcoin doing another 5x on top of the ATH is very reasonable.  Who knows when.  
You can use it... go use it... it's not that bad.  Blind people like you had the same issues with the internet in 92... Usability will come after the infrastructure is sound enough to support it.

POS isn't viable for many reasons.  Stake grinding for starters and there goes your energy consumption.  Not to mention the money that could be made by shorting the asset while preventing any new transactions from going through.

Depends on what you're trying to buy.  If it is something cheap the risk is low and there is little risk in accepting an unconfirmed transaction.  It would cost the buyer a fair bit of money to steal that with something like RBF.  Also as Lightning grows in adoption it will be favored more and more for these types of transactions.
If you're buying something more substantial like a car for example. Then paying for a higher priority fee is worth it.  The amount of the bitcoin being transferred doesn't affect the size of the transaction as much.  In this scenario it is permissible to pay the higher fee to get the transaction into the next block or two.  This is where Bitcoin really shines since unlike the traditional banking system which often times charges a % fee for money transfers especially international transfers ... bitcoin's fees will remain pretty small.  Paying 5 dollars to send 20k is a bargain by comparison to traditional methods.  


As blocks are mined unconfirmed transactions that didn't make it into the block are prioritized higher.  Also you can bump the fee if you want to move the transaction forward.  
The Bitcoin vs. Bitcoin Cash debate comes down to this.  
If you believe that Bitcoin must remain outside the control of governments either for a economic revolution where the people control the world's reserve currency. Censorship resistance.  Perhaps you see issues with potential warfare being played out by nation states trying to attack Bitcoin.  Then Bitcoin must remain flexible enough to deal with things like a split in the internet or nation state attacks.  This will require us to use non-traditional networks like satellites, mesh nets, and Tor.   Networks that have extremely low and sporadic bandwidth. 
If you believe that the governments and banks should continue to control the monetary supply of the world and see no threat of nation state war.  Then Bitcoin Cash is the best option for you.  
No matter how efficient you get block propagation working.  It can't work over a low bandwidth network if the sum space used by the transactions a mining node would be expected to have in order to propagate blocks efficiently exceeds the bandwidth available to the node.

I hate to burst your bubble, but I'd rather do it than have you go on with a false sense of security.
That's an awful safe.  Look it up on youtube these types of "safes" are horribly insecure.
That safe is at best mildly fire resistant.  It is in no way shape or form fire proof.  Furthermore far better safes even in the 4000 dollar range are fire resistant and the valuables such as electronics are likely to be melted.
You're better off with an encrypted USB stick at a family member's house in a different geographic location.  Good encryption.
Another product that is worth purchasing is cryptosteel.  It's fairly expensive but worth it IMHO.  That plus this safe you'll actually have something moderate if you bolt it to the floor.  Personally I'd buy at least 2 and encrypt your seed using openssl and an airgapped computer using something like ubuntu live where the OS is running off a USB stick or CD.  
By having an off site encrypted backup and an encrypted backup locally at home I would say you have some decent security even without a multi thousand dollar safe.

A pyramid scheme would require that you get people to buy and then you get a cut of whatever they buy and then they need to repeat that  and you get a cut of their subordinates too. 
There are some exchanges that might offer some kind of reward if you sign people up for your service with a referral link.   That's not the point of buying Bitcoin.  You can take the Bitcoin and hold it on your own off an exchange like having gold in a safe or cash in your wallet.  Also if they get people to use their referral link you get nothing from that. 
In the US Bitcoin has been available for purchase by regulated exchanges for over 5 years now.  Coinbase being probably the largest running one.  
If Bitcoin were a ponzi scheme with a run up from literally 0 to currently at 8000... it would have collapsed by now. 
That being said there was a notable ponzi scheme in Crypto called Bitconnect.  This project collapsed when Bitcoin tumbled from it's all time highs in 2017 (it shut down early 2018)  US regulators were already in the process of going after them.
Explain to them that you're interested in getting into Bitcoin and only Bitcoin.  While Bitcoin has 10 years of history of being traded and the system never going down etc. etc.  The altcoins in the market are not the same and that after you learn more about Bitcoin you'll want to do a lot of research into other alts before even considering them.  
Don't consider getting into trading or even ask them to put in a lot of money into it.  Just start small.
Tell them you want to purchase some from a regulated exchange and learn how it works.  Explain to them that Bitcoin is a new technology in the early stages like where the internet was in the early 1990's.  
After you get through the initial steps read the white paper and begin learning more about it.  How to secure your Bitcoin properly etc. etc.

Why the fuck would I invest in something that is going to ultimately lose value over time?  
Right now ... bitcoin is exploding eventually it will level off and the inflation (expansion of the money supply) will continue to occur at a very steady predictable rate until 2140 where there will be no inflation of the currency.  Just deflation as coins  lost.  
Keynesian economics is bull shit where someone would have to believe that people wouldn't buy things because they could buy more months down the line.  Guess what Technology rapidly loses its value and newer and better shit keeps coming out.  Yet it's a hugely successful industry.  People can't buy more time. So... do I want to wait 40 years to have my own Imax in my house or will I take a 90 inch television now? .. hmm tough choice.  Well if I just starve myself for a few more months I can afford to eat at that ridiculously expensive restaurant.  
When people have money do they sock it away in their mattress?  Maybe but most likely they invest it.  Maybe keep it in a bank... where the bank and then take that money and make investments in new businesses, homes etc. etc.  Hopefully business are profitable... homes increase in value etc.  The bank turns some profit and kicks it back to their customers.  Banks have to now actually be held accountable for their actions.  
Oh wait... banks don't exist anymore.

Please don't destroy Bitcoins.  Donate it to random charities or spread it around the network. 
If your project took off you're going to restrict the number of available Bitcoins causing the price to rise.  We already can't get back lost wallets as it is which will lead to deflation of the currency which will encourage hoarding and prevent the currency from becoming widely adopted.

Oh I began responding to this on my phone and got distracted.
Don't know what wormhole is or Omni.  I'll look into it. 
The beauty of segwit is that it was a softfork.  A hardfork will always be politicized for profit and power. Therefore they should be reserved when it is absolutely necessary.  
Since I have established that really all btrash wants is onchain scaling... this means that they will have a linear scale progression model.  4-7tx per second means to compete with Visa you need a gigabyte to support the world you need a terabyte.  These are absurd.  However let's take it a step further.
32 MB is a lot and they don't work they crash nodes hand over fist.  It's extremely resource intensive not just in hard disk space but in bandwidth, memory, and processing power as well.  
Blocks aren't found 10 minutes on the dot every time.  Sometimes they are found within seconds.  2 or 3 of them.  That's a lot of resources. 
Yes I know Graphene and it's fucking moronic.  Most of the optimizations have already been put in place.  The part of graphene not already implemented by Greg Maxwell and his considerable efforts towards block propagation optimization is the part of Graphene that removes the autonomy of the miners to decide which transactions make it into a block and which transactions do not.  This means either miners don't put any of their own transactions in blocks and everything needs to be broadcast or there will be a lot of back and forth getting the missing transactions.  
At scale it's a joke... again it takes time and resources processing, memory, bandwidth and disk space.
However to defeat your notion as to why 32 MB is absurd even further is this.  Bitcoin cannot die.  Why is this?  It's decentralized and most importantly it's light weight.  Government wants to shut down slushpool? Great another 10 pools are created in the next hour.  Governments start rading all pools? Great we can operate over TOR.  Natural disaster cuts the main network connection between Europe and the United States fine we can operate over satellites.  No more internet connectivity in the mountains?  Great we can operate over meshnets.
The point here is if bitcoin is to remain nation state hard it needs to remain nimble.  We need to keep the option of retreating to these more durable but significantly slower networks.

I'm not too familiar with these addresses.  I have heard they are related to cryptolocker or another variants of ransomware like wannacrythat encrypts your hard drive and requires bitcoin in order to unlock your data.
AFAIK these when you are infected with ransomware you're given a unique address not a communal address.  Therefore the money you pay for randomware would not be to one of these addresses and instead after you pay the randomware the money would be transferred to that account. 
This means for your average user this policy is not relevant.  however if you're in the US and send money to one of these addresses you're screwed ... of course the money is only going to one of these addresses if you send it and the only people who would do that are the attackers themselves (maybe some hooligan might try).  Therefore these people shouldn't be in an area the United States law enforcement can get to them.  
As far as being censorship resistant.  Let's just say there was a variant of ransomware that had everyone pay to a communal address then it would require some sort of signature to ensure you actually paid the ransom.  This adds a lot of complexity but who knows. 
In the US it's fairly impractical to obtain Bitcoin without some sort of KYC being involved.  Therefore you'd have to "wash" your Bitcoin.  
Long story short.  Bitcoin is censorship resistant and after these sanctions it still is.  Nothing the government has done prevents you from sending money to these addresses.  They cannot reverse the transactions or circumvent them from happening.  You can still do this.  If for example they wanted to put such a sanction on wikileaks then you could still send them bitcoin ... you'd just be at risk of prosecution.  If you want to avoid prosecution then you'd need to take appropriate measures to hide your activity which will not be easy but it is still possible. 
To contrast this with traditional banking.  The government would be able to prevent transfers to the sanctioned accounts and possibly shut down the accounts entirely and seize their funds as well as the accounts that attempt to transfer to the blacklisted accounts.  This is not possible with Bitcoin.

As for not buying litecoin.. Look at how volatile Bitcoin is.  Litecoin... WAY more volatile and there are some cut throat motherfuckers out there just waiting to chew you up and spit you out for breakfast.  Lot of people losing their shirts fucking with litecoin.
Now unlike many people here I like litecoin... I think it's cool. Everything else I think is crap.  
So ... buy 262mBTC and hold.  It's your best bet. Especially since it sounds like this might be a little more money then you're willing to lose you should strongly consider just buying 100 mBTC maybe even 50.

I would argue that mining is part of what makes BTC so valuable.  People are spending money on equipment and power to mine BTC and people aren't going to give up those BTC without getting a fiat profit.  
I would say that 3k is at this point not enough money to get into mining.  It's in his best interest to simply buy BTC.
Realistically it is always going to be in your best interest to simply buy BTC.  However if you were to go in with a larger investment ... lets say 25k perhaps consider doing 80/20 buying/mining.  My reasoning behind this is if everyone simply bought btc and no one mined then both ventures would lose value.  This is of course realistic, but I still think it's important to support your investment if you're going to buy a lot of BTC

CPU &lt; GPU &lt; ASIC 
ASIC is an application specific integrated circuit.  Its a specificly specialized chip that executes 1 type of operation and 1 type of operation only.  It's basically as fast as you can possibly do something.  Major companies on wall street spend literally 10s of millions of dollars developing ASIC systems for high speed trading. 
A CPU will technically work, but you're not going to really get any BTC out of it... I don't think mining with a CPU today you could mine a bitcoin in 1000 years.  
With a very high end GPU today... I don't think you'd make a BTC in an entire year.  You'd spend more money on electricity then you would earn.  Everyone with high end GPU mining rigs are mining Alt-coins specifically litecoins ... it's really not worth it for BTC.. it's pointless really.
Today there is ASICs which are only offered by a handful of startup companies that are notoriously unreliable.  Going with ASICs is a straight up gamble.  You're pretty much better off simply going to a casino where your odds are known and are better.  It takes a lot of research and even then it's a huge gamble.
Being new to BTC and asking me these questions you need to simply go to coinbase and buy BTC.

7950's are high end graphics cards designed for gaming.  If you define Normal as being only made of mass produced parts then sure... but that's a rather broad definition in my opinion.  I wouldn't call a computer with 4 7950's normal by any stretch of the imagination.  
As for whether or not you're right... I believe that was the theory, but I'm sure there are some really smart electrical engineers who are desperately trying to prove the theory wrong.  As I am no electrical engineer I'd have to defer.
If an FPGA can perform at a reduced KW/H ratio that would present a threat in terms of scale in which a household could run these machines.  Instead of having a house running 6 machines at max power generating 10 ltc a day you could have an array of FPGAs doing the same thing while on one circuit.

Here is a little wisdom for you.  First you get the business and then you get the website.  Then you focus on making the minimal aspect required for the customer to interact with the company.  Then build on that and you really shouldn't need a web dev.  
If you're working with btc this community is smart.  It bleeds weak links out.  We care about reliability not looking professional.  Cryoniks looks professional but we're outed immediately as scams.  
Offer a few low cost products maybe even just one.  Accept via email orders to start and if it becomes hard to manage that's the kind of problem you want to have.  If you right by your customers you'll go far as a Bitcoin business

If someone compromised okcupid for example you'd likely have enough information to background check someone and learn enough to answer some security questions.  Mtgox offers yubikeys.  
However I could compromise your bank system with malware just as easily as I can with mtgox.  The problem is the users, lack of consequences, and potential for gain.
You can be an idiot with a bank and you're okay because its hard to get that money in a place it can be used without it being tracked.  You're insured.  Fraudulent transactions can typically be reversed.
With btc its easy to clean the money you're not insured and fraud can't be undone.

Not really.  Because it is decentralized it means all of the miners agree on the protocol being used.  If they don't like the protocol they don't update.
Now lets say someone like Gavin were to push an update that people didn't like.  We might just decide to go back and maybe do a fork.  Meaning that there could potentially be some lost transactions during the limbo time.

If the price rises there doesnt seem to be any incentive to buy as the price is pinned to Gox.  Who gets that profit?

BFL is a scam.  
I am going against everyone here with this.  I think 2014 will be the year of the mining.  We've kind of peaked as far as difficulty increases go.  ASIC manufacturers are making prototype hardware... making new software is hard enough but making hardware woo... way more challenging.  
We are close to 6 PH now the last diff change was 19% .. this one I am estimating will be 15% way lower then it has been in months.  I think we will see another 25-35% increase after this next adjustment coming up in 3 days.  Then it will be back down to 15% and stay there for a few months. 
I don't think Hashfast, BFL, or Cointerra are going to ship anytime soon and even if they do I don't think they will be tacking on all that much.  
We're approaching the limitation of people being able to mine in their homes.  This means not only will electricity be a factor, but so will having the miners hosted in a facility.  
This means the barrier to entry for mining is high.  The cost of mining is high... it's going to drive the BTC price up substantially next year. 
If you do it right I think you can get started in mining and getting in on a Neptune Group buy is a start.  However it's risky business... much easier and safer to simply buy BTC and keep them in a paper wallet.  Buying BTC is where everyone should start.

Bitcoins aren't a safe investment and they aren't for the faint of heart.  
If you're looking to go in with a friend for 300 bucks... I'd say mine with your computers for a couple of weeks... also hit up bitvisitor as often as you can.  Get all that in mtgox and have at it.  
Understand that it is volatile as HELL... so buy low sell high. Sometimes your money is going to be locked up.  While I was waiting for my money to make it into the exchanges I mined a bit with my computer made an amazing .80 USD ... got that into mtgox and started trading.  I got it up to 1.50 before my money got in.  Now I have money in and I'm down, but it's cool because I believe it will come back up.  If not next week... maybe by the end of the month... if not by then .. in a couple years.  I'm willing to wait.  I personally love the position I'm in.  If it goes up I make money... if it goes down I can buy a lot of bitcoins... either is a win in my book.  You just have to have the resolve and understanding that your money can get locked up and it might not pay off for a while. 
So as you can guess I'm a believer.  I think getting into bitcoins is a very wise move.  I think its very early in the game. A few years ago I was interested and didn't get it... people were all like the ship has sailed.  If I was like fuck you and did it anyway I'd probably be a multimillionaire right now.

Well here is the thing.. An arcade would have to provide a way for users to buy Bitcoin on site to play the games.  Like cash for tokens or for quarters.  
The arcade could allow you to bring your own btc or purchase onsite with a "loaded" public address.  W/o the private key the coins could only be spent at that location.

So.. dipshit.  Lets say you want to buy something with BTC 2 days ago... with a nice price of 230... And you restocked today you silly piece of human shit.  at 309.  
Now you just paid more in fiat than you had too.  Instead of 10 dollars... now you have to spent 13.4347826.  To reload
(310/230)*10    ... don't hurt yourself trying to wrap your head around this advanced mathematical equation. 
It's true sometimes you might make out, but since most people are thinking that BTC will go up. More often then not you're going to get burned.  You're never making a bad move by buying immediately.

Lets say Exchange A is really cheap for you to deposit money into.  With dwolla and campbx and mtgox before that... it use to cost .25 cents.  Now I don't know.
Deposit money into Exchange A... convert USD to BTC ... then with draw that btc into your wallet and then transfer it to BTC-e.  You could just go straight from Exchange A to BTC-e but since you don't control either wallet directly you may have difficulty fixing any potential problems with the transfer.

I don't see why this is being up voted with such an obvious error in logic.
The only way it can be profitable is by charging a higher price than the cloud hashing resource COSTS!  
If the cloud hashing resource costs 100 dollars and it's lifetime ROI is 90 dollars then it isn't going to be profitable.  
If the hashing power costs a total 20 dollars and they charge 30 dollars they are making profit even if its lifetime ROI is 50 bucks. 
Now, that being said.  This next part is directed to OP.  JDTFM  (Just do the fucking math)  There are plenty of calculators out there that account for difficulty increases.  They should tell you there is no way in hell you'll make more than a very small minority a fraction of your "investment" back.  At least burning your cash would provide you with some heat.. hell maybe you could even light a cigarette.  
Then look into the company ... Oh wait you fucking did that and found it the company was absolute fucking shit.  
So anyway Someone else posted here last week about how those cloud hashing sites are simply ponzi schemes and it made a lot of sense.  I wouldn't buy any equipment running a business like that.   If I were you i'd wait for KNCMiner's next gen and get in on a soniq group buy... or better yet buy it yourself.

@_date: 2013-12-02 20:23:13
Oh ... absolutely.. understood.  However with bitcoin I'm a bit paranoid.  Remember this pretty much eliminates banks all together... which means we take on the responsibilities of banks. Without deep insurance pockets and a government to print off more monopoly money that means security is serious business.
So it all comes down to how much you trust the ATM.  What OS does the ATM have... It likely has internet access.  What type of random number generator does it use.  What information does it store... is it possible potentially to steal the ATM and recover some of those private keys?  
So personally if I were you I'd move them to a paperwallet.

So yes, this is not only normal but expected.

No don't memorize your private key... that's ridiculous.  If you don't have a printer don't use a printer at work... just take a screenshot and save it.  
But really just take your time.. If you have access to another computer ... maybe set that up as your BTC computer.  Otherwise try getting an ubuntu cd and booting on that then make the offline wallet and save it to a couple usb sticks.  Then buy a printer and print it out there.
Good luck. and welcome to the club.. I wish you great success.  Also I believe the price is going to tank.  Don't worry about it.  BTC does that.  It's normal. You got btc at a good price you just have to wait a bit.

Well if you're in the US you should use Coinbase.  Then I would say localbitcoins.com.  
It's a good size amount... but honestly it's chump change compared to what gets thrown around on the exchanges.  No exchange is going to care.  It's not uncommon for the exchanges to move that 2.5 times in a 1 minute interval. 
Well I like Coinbase.  You have to wait a while initially to get your first batch of coins... then you can buy some instantly after you verify a credit card and after 30 days you can buy up to 10 instantly.  Safest route for you.  Problem is it's going to take you at least a few weeks to push that through coinbase.  During that time however the price could double (though I think it's unlikely) or half (again unlikely, but perhaps more likely than doubling at this time)  Personally I think for the next few weeks there will be multiple occasions to get in to bitcoin at 600.
A miner or just someone who bought a bunch of coins.
Nope not interested.

Seems like an easy problem to solve.  Just have it go to a number of charities.  Let's say 10 charities.  So 1 btc and 1 btc the most they would get is .2 btc back.
Another option is to distribute the funds to everyone in the market.  This has the added benefit of encouraging participation.  Perhaps to be eligible you'd have to have made a purchase in the past month or something.

Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency.  It is regulated by an open source program that runs in a distributed manner.  This means no single country,company, or person controls Bitcoin.  
There are markets where you can exchange Bitcoin for goods.  There are exchanges where you can exchange Bitcoin for fiat or other crypto currency. There are even stock exchanges.

Actually my experience with them has been pretty consistent when the site is functioning.  Real consistency with a highly transactional system is not a simple system to design.  Neither is a 99.999 architecture.  
Bitcoin is pretty small in the world GDP.  It takes significant investment bin talent to design such a system.  It isn't a simple oh put it in the cloud or throw better hardware etc.  
Getting competent developers is hard enough getting good developers is damn near impossible then take that subset who could architect a system like this on the first go.. You're talking about a significant upfront investment.
So sit down child and shut the fuck up.  Until they steal money from you go back to Gox loser.

Would you duct tape an ounce of gold to your phone and then ask about security?  I'd hope not... I hope you'd put it a safe in your home.
If you really want to secure your btc get a dedicated machine with linux on it and use it for absolutely nothing but BTC.  Make sure it's locked down.  Also use paper wallets.

A blockchain is a datastructure that can establish an order of events by using cryptography and proof of work.  It doesn't need to be a ledger.  Bitcoin's blocks are pages in a ledger because bitcoin is a system for transaction bitcoin.  It needs the order of events in order to verify that money hasn't already been spent.

@_date: 2013-12-11 01:55:29
Right you sign the transaction.  
However I don't think Coin's interface is sophisticated enough to password protect it.  So a bill comes... you have to enter in the amount and probably input some password.  Also, if the card is away from your phone for x amount of time it should disable itself somehow.
Perhaps it wipes itself after 2-3 minutes of being away from the phone... and gets reprogrammed if it is ever near the phone again.  
Perhaps the phone could program it ... that would be secure actually... It could work. 
The design would have to support programming the card via the bluetooth interface for it to be convenient.  So there is the problem...
A Coin for bitcoin would have to be changed.  A more sophisticated user interface that would allow the user to put a password on it.  Also you'd need to put a timer on it to disable it if you don't have your phone.
Frankly I think it's not as cool.. because you're going to have your phone anyway and there really good way to get around keepign the phone out of the equation

See no obligation on your part to guarantee anything.  However if you wanted to make sure that every gun purchase goes through an FFL you could make it a point that the escrow would only be released to the seller if they show you shipping to an FFL dealer.  
I can certainly appreciate reservations on facilitating a gun market and the extra cost that could be involved in developing it in a responsible manner.  
I'm assuming knives, tasers, and drugs would also be banned from the market as well.  Is this a correct assumption?
Also, what is the stance on selling accessories for firearms.  Like magazines, flash suppressors, and maybe slings provided they are legal in both the seller and buyer's area?

You acknowledge the difficulty will rise.... but you're not accounting for it in your math at all.  Difficulty is the most important factor to consider when calculating mining ROI.  
using my pessimistic figure which often turn out to actually be optimistic I calculate you'd make about 3.75 dollars profit after a year of mining.  So you spend 46 bucks you'd get back 49.75 in btc.  This is assuming the unrealistic estimation that you're getting 100% of your mining. Which you're not going to get.  You're going to have lost uptime.  You may have to switch pools if your pool goes down for whatever reason.  etc. etc. 
Now there is a chance that my pessimistic prediction is in fact pessimistic.  I am estimating that the difficulty will continue to rise at the same rate over the next year which is not likely to happen.  So you might make 15-20 bucks profit if BTC stays the same.  
So if you want to gamble that this guy is going to provide excellent service for 46 bucks... It's simply not a smart bet compared to putting that 46 bucks in simply buying BTC.  Then the only variable you have to worry about is the price of BTC.

You getting stuck with a bad deal.  Your fault. 
I'd say go with KNC.. Cointerra seems to be pretty cheap but I believe they are BFL 2.0 so until they deliver something I wouldn't bother... in fact I wouldn't bother with cointerra until they really prove themselves.  Hashfast is suppose to be shipping early January so lets see how that turns out.

The bitcoin community is comprised of the people who worth with bitcoins.  The bitcoin network is the technical implementation. 
What you're presenting here is a fallacy.  We're talking about Mt.Gox and it's relationship to bitcoin.  It's a major factor in the bitcoin community absolutely, but it is not a critical component of the network.  If it was then when Mt.Gox goes down then all bitcoin transactions would stop.  This is not the case.  If mtgox didn't exist tomorrow the network would still exist.  I don't know how you could magically all of a sudden make it so that people couldn't meet face to face and exchange fiat for currency, but if that happens I think we'd have bigger problems on our hands.  
If gox disappeared tomorrow it would certainly have an impact on the value of bitcoin, but it would certainly still exist.  Too many people have too much invested into it to just turn coat and run.  Miners would still exist... mining traditionally isn't a very profitable endeavor.. at least in the short term.  People would absolutely keep mining because bitcoin offers freedom from the banks and government controlled fiat.  
Case and point mt.gox isn't part of the bitcoin protocol.

Well actually BFL somewhat resembles a Ponzi scheme.  With the funding coming from "investors" or "pre order customers" .. The very first customers to finally receive the machines made out alright.
As orders began being cancelled.. .they then started their next pre-order funding solution .. selling chips which i believe some of the proceeds went towards getting the initial orders out the door...  IE paying previous customers with new customer's money. 
Then they moved a lot of the pre-orders over to monarch-preorders... and again more investors or "pre order customers" ...
So I think that qualifies somewhat.. The only reason they aren't belly up is because they are mining with the equipment they actually have produced before shipping.

The price that gets thrown around a lot is the price btc is trading at currently on the exchange.  Specifically the last trade.
That price is an organic representation of the market's analysis of factors of rarity, usefulness, and speculation.  Many many more variables go into the equation.  It's far too complicated to actually calculate with some kind of formula.

@_date: 2013-12-02 04:47:37
Probably not... certainly not because of merchants... most merchants are using payment systems like bitpay or coinbase which convert it directly into fiat for them.  
Bitcoin is too volatile still for a business to just accept with liabilities like paying their distributors and employees on a regular basis.  At least not with a healthy amount of fiat in reserve.  
Right now Bitcoin is still in its toddler phase.  It's an excellent method of accepting payments, but it still has a long way to go for tight margin companies to accept directly and keep their money in there.  
Perhaps a good method for a company that wants to accept btc directly would be to buy bitcoin now and wait 6 months to a year so that it's value compared to fiat is healthy.  Then they can accept btc directly w/o a third party like coinbase or bitpay and still have some cushion in terms of being able to meet their financial obligations.

You have a macbook... I'm guessing that's your primary machine?  If my assumption is correct... then my answer is Neither.
Get a new computer to put your wallet on and to do all of your bitcoin activities exclusively.  You should consider even putting it on it's own network.  It should be running ubuntu and be locked down.

The current fiat monetary systems allows the government to tax the people without changing the tax code. Just print more money. This allows them to steal purchasing power from savings accounts and investments.

Bitcoin is not a currency.  Its value is not assigned by government.  Its not authorized by a government.  
If mtgox let you turn USD into Bitcoin them get it back in franks that would be something.  However they don't.

Then buy one of [these]( little guys.  Now it wont make much but it will probably perform almost as well as your current computer for 40 bucks compared to 2000 not to mention a whole lot less electricity.  Then you can learn about mining and invest big when you know what's going on.

I have a right to be secure in my person and property from unreasonable searches without a warrant drawn upon probable cause and outside of exigent circumstances.  This right is absolute and not up for debate because of how you feel.  
People like you don't appreciate this fact.  You give it lip service, but at the end of the day you're willing to trash someone's rights in the name of whatever cause you believe in.  This is dangerous and so are you.  
The incorrect punishment of non-violent crime in this country has caused incalculable losses to society.  An easy example is drugs.  A group of people like you, willing to trample rights in the name of their cause, chose drugs as their cause.  Drug use is a non-violent offense and the charges that come with it are an abomination. 
    Behavior involving physical force intended to hurt, damage, or kill someone or something.
    Strength of emotion or an unpleasant or destructive natural force.
In what way does exchanging computer files meet the necessary qualities to be defined as violence?  
Does a person need to express severe emotion to send a child porn document vs. a word document?  
Who sustains the physical damage or even potential physical damage in the act of sending and/or receiving bits over a computer? 
Now, I could certainly see an argument to be made that soliciting child pornography is equal to hiring a hit man.  In fact I think that is a position that could be argued very well.
You seriously want us to read through a 40 fucking page forum.  I can do it but i charge .5 btc an hour and I require payment upfront.  1HWhCFQ9w1PaQRP4LzjhqoqduazeCcFq8h
A half hour should do so .25 btc  OOOOORRRRR You can link us to the relevant parts. Hell page numbers will do.  
The fuck I will give up any of my rights to apease you and your cause.  If a child pornographer gives up their right voluntarily or unwittingly great.  Go after them.  Otherwise leave me, my rights, and the rights of all bitcoin users the hell alone.  
Lastly you're full of shit if you think our current enforcement addresses child pornography is an effective manner.  Seizing and tracking money is one tool they have access to.  Unfortunately that is a tool which tramples on the rights of millions of people.  When it goes tough. There are other methods of tracking down assholes and some of them might even be more effective.

There really isn't a price difference ... the costs are just more varied at the other exchanges. 
@_date: 2013-05-03 19:49:09
Lol you're an idiot.  What a wonderfully constructed fallacious argument.  
I presented 2 options... Bitcoin are known to go up in value over enough time so provided you possess the resolve not to sell at a loss you'll be fine in a few years.  
Otherwise... Letting the miner mine and holding on to the coins for a few years would eventually dig you out of the hole.
The safer bet would be to reinvest in more mining power using the initial earnings to average out your bad bet with a better one. This would be the equivalent in trading to buying heavy when the value is down to off set the losses from purchases at a higher price point.  Of course you're not following this and that's OK

I find money that is managed outside of government/bank control EXTREMELY attractive.  
As far as gold is concerned it's worthless to me outside of its use as a store of value.  I can melt it.. fucking great .. I can melt lead too... and I can get a whole lot more of that easily.  Serve me very well in a SHTF scenario.  Conductor .. really?  Silver is better ... Copper is better.  I just read audiophiles can't tell the difference between music played over an expensive gold plated monster cable vs. a copper wire.  
The only thing that gives gold it's value is speculation, it's rarity, and how fucking hard it is to get it.  Guess what Bitcoin has those 3 things going for it too.  
Also... there is namecoin which is pretty cool and could potentially solve a major problem we have with the inherent insecurities in today's internet.  Which btw produces way more value (the internet) then gold does.  
Isn't gold by it's very nature deflationary.

Yes, it's certainly technically possible, but it is in no way easy.  
First you'd need to do some type of distributed escrow system.  Lets say you and I want to make a bet on a sports game.  I write some code to get the game results.  Based on the rules of the agreement either you or I would get the money, maybe the money gets returned and the bet cancelled, or one of us gets more money and the other gets something back.  
Then I sign the code and send it to you.  Then you sign the code and begin the transaction.  Then "Miners" would validate the transaction and run the signed code.  Based on the results the miners would then execute who gets the money.
Now with a distributed market place people could put bids and asks and when there is a match the "miners" could process the transaction. 
The trick that I guess I'm a bit fuzzy on is how do you transfer the coins from my wallet and your wallet to a neutral wallet that no one else has access to.  I could see this requiring an awful lot of core computer science knowledge in order to implement.  Cryptography knowledge obviously, but also more basic knowledge like how to write a distributed virtual machine.

I don't think this graph really takes into account the way the bitcoin community has grown in the past 6 months.
Significant investment has been made in ASICs and now there are 2 major players not just one that are culturally disconnected. 
Not to mention now that there are now respectable exchanges not just Gox.

Just letting you know.. I think that the price of bitcoins are going to absolutely TANK over the next few days into next week.  Don't jump off a bridge... it's okay.  The things that I believe will contribute to the massive tank in prices I don't think are serious for even the short term (over the course of the next month)  I think in a month or two well see a gain again back up to over 120.  Next week however I wouldn't be surprised if we see prices of like 30.  
@_date: 2013-05-30 19:54:53
the answer is... Maybe.  But for all intensive purposes please proceed as if it is impossible and back up the private keys

I literally just got my refund on both my orders and my upgrade.  
They haven't completed the sale because they haven't delivered the product to you. 
Just log in and contact them or email them.  The paypal info and order numbers are helpful.  
My experience with their customer service has been excellent.  Josh's attitude is not representative of the company's overall culture.  
Fact of the matter is this is business not a self help group.  Bitcoin is a very high yielding investment, but nothing changes the fundamentals of life.  The more return an investment offers the more risky it is.  Objectively,  gambling is an investment.  Being an early adopter in BFL was an investment that was a gamble.  
Josh is a very powerful individual in a company that is making money printing machines.  In a gold rush you want to be selling shovels.  That's what Josh is doing.  He doesn't need anyone's business.  He values it, but why deal with a PIA customer and waste time and money when they have 1000 people a day lining up to hand them money.  Cut the bad fruit off the tree and get some press out of it.

If you paid 31k for a June preorder of a 60gh... that was a very very very bad decision.  First is the risk in even getting the device.  I really REALLY hope you do get it.
By my calculations which are optimistic but not insanely optimistic... in April 2014 you'll be in the red 3900 dollars USD.  This assumes 100 dollars/per bitcoin.... 
Now stop... take a deep breathe... and continue
I don't believe you're fucked.  Unless you don't get the device or if the device fails for whatever reason.  
Understand this cold dead and hard right now.  You're committed for the long haul. 
In the next 5 years or so bitcoins will likely hit 500... of course this is me talking out of my ass.  
To make it into the black by April 2014... You're going to have to reinvest your earnings either in more hardware or by buying shares in AsicMiner (I think you'll have to search the subreddit for the AsicMiner group you can buy shares in) 
There is also trading.  It isn't too hard.  Just understand and accept that bitcoins are insanely volatile.  This month we might see bitcoin prices of 30USD per bitcoin and as high as 140.  
If Paypal starts working with bitcoin I think you'll be plenty good. 
@_date: 2013-10-31 09:24:13

OK so I get a large sum of bitcoins to an address then split them amongst thousands of addresses.  Send them through exchanges through various crypto currencies.  some to charities and other legit businesses.  Maybe I gamble with it a little bit etc.
Then hours later the origin destination address is blacklisted.  But these coins have already been cleaned and integrated into the ecosystem.  To blacklist those coins would implicate thousands of people and cause undo loss to those people. 
What if it takes weeks or even months to blacklist an address.  Which is more probable if done through a judicial system

@_date: 2013-05-30 16:54:35
That is how I understood it originally. So let's take the KP example it take 3 months from transaction to registration.  Over that time that money is routed in many different ways.  Through exchanges for other crypto currency.  Local Bitcoin etc etc. 
Now you have a state where the criminal has clean coins and many innocent people have dirty coins.  Any exchanges would have to allow access for where coins turned in different paths and some might not even keep such a log.  
Furthermore this is only the beginning of bucking the system.  It already smells of the drug war failure.

So I think offline storage just means there is no possibility of the keys ever being accessed via the internet.  So if you have a laptop that can't connect to the internet and you generate your keys there and that's how you keep your btc then that's considered offline storage.
Cold storage I believe is paper wallets.  Perhaps if you make a paperwallet with a computer that has access to the internet after you've generated your keys then I suppose that's no longer offline storage.  However if they don't exist on your computer anymore in digital form that's cold storage.
Best practices seems to suggest that we should be making paper wallets on machines that can't connect to the internet during or after the keys have been generated.
You can do this with a dedicated machine or doing an ubuntu boot from a CD.  You should be able to google how to look it up.
Bitaddress.org seems to be the way to do this.
@_date: 2013-05-30 16:08:21
Continue.. Because there is a severe logical disconnect in your explanation.  You talk about registration of addresses and then somehow that translates to worthless Bitcoin?
Then you went on again about Bitcoins attained legally you can keep as if wallets that obtain coins illegally can't.
Also nothing stops miners from operating anonymously.

Second.  Your computer is not secure.  Don't do anything with bitcoin on your machine where you wouldn't want to lose the money.

LOL Your statement is absolutely fucking idiotic. Lets say I buy a 10 shares of ASICMiner for 2.5BTC and that has an estimated ROI of 41% /yr on dividends alone. That doesn't take into consideration whether or not the price of shares goes up, but lets just say it doesn't and stays at 2.5btc/share. If BTC Shoots up to 500 USD a share then I've made gains there too, because I can still sell my shares for 2.5 BTC. 
3000 = 25 BTC, * 1.41 = 35.25 * 500 = 17625
All this assuming the prices of shares holds, which it very well could go up to realize even more profits.

When dealing with bitcoin the mindset I believe everyone should have is "Fort Knox" security.  You're literally taking on the type of risk banks have.  Banks invest an insane amount of money into security and they still get compromised.  Thankfully they have insurance, but sadly we don't have that option.  
1.  Have a dedicated computer that is ONLY for bitcoin and absolutely nothing else.  A fresh install.
2.  Use a ridiculous password 15+ chars long upper and lower case letters, numbers, and symbols.  
3.  Change your mtgox password every 24 hours to prevent withdrawl.  
If you don't have a dedicated machine perhaps you can use the offline wallet technique described [here](  and a usb key fob for storage.  Encrypt the drive.

anyone who wants to can mine bitcoin.  Although today you need an ASIC if you want a chance to be profitable in BTC.

Clearly you don't know how the coinbase/bitpay app works.  When you ring up a sale they guarantee that price.  You're getting the USD.. Coinbase goes "Take this much BTC and we'll give you This much USD".
No one fucking stores their money in their mattress anymore at least not in any way that it affects the economy.  They store it in banks. Banks are suppose to take this money .. invest it ... give you a return... but because no one is keeping money in banks because they can't get rid of their fiat fast enough they ... I've already countered this elementary argument as to why inflation is good.  Oh yeah The government is just going to rob you of your wealth and cut your pay.. that's great.  In what fucking scenario is ANYONE better off losing money?  It literally breaks my mind for people to perpetuate this dribble. If you losing purchasing power is a good thing..why do we demonize muggers they are doing a great thing.  
Your own scenario doesn't even make sense.  If I loan you 10 BTC at 6% interest you owe me 10.6 BTC.  If BTC deflated by 3% my purchasing power has increased 9%.  
Deflation makes older people richer?  Oh shit... that's brilliant... I never thought of that.  Oh wait yes I did.. and older people retire they don't work as much and need more purchasing power.

Monetary inflation is adding units of value to the monetary base.  IE. Printing more dollars.
Bitcoin inflates currently through mining to a maximum of 21 million bitcoins.  
Dividing a single bitcoin down further doesn't add more bitcoins to the available total, it just divides them further.
Think of it this way... right now it's popular to trade gold in half gram units.  If you come up with a way to trade gold in quarter gram units then you're just trading less gold... you didn't actually add any more gold into existence.  This is completely independent from the market value of a gram of gold.
If yesterday w/o a quarter gram divisible unit of gold the price of 1 gram of gold is 100 dollars making a half gram unit of gold worth 50 dollars... Today when you created your quarter gram divisible unit the price of 1 gram of gold is still 100 dollars.  The price of the half gram is 50 and the price of the quarter gram is 25 dollars.  
Same thing with Bitcoins... You're not adding any bitcoins into existence you're just dividing them.

When you buy BTC with coinbase you're not buying bitcoins you're buying an entry in a database saying that coinbase owes you X amount of BTC.  
Similar to a bank. You put money in... they keep a ledger of how much money you owe them.  However unlike a bank coinbase isn't part of the FDIC.  Meaning if they go under either through government shutdown or a coin robbery then you might never get your coins.
Now coinbase for now appears to be an excellent service with a good reputation.  However in order for your BTC to be safe from the threats I have mentioned above the best place for your BTC is in a wallet you control.  Now this might not be the safest place for your BTC.
If you aren't diligent about backing up your keys and securing them then you could lose them through data loss or being hacked.
So if you do decide to keep your BTC in wallets that you control then I would STRONGLY recommend you look into the best way to secure your BTC by using a dedicated computer used exclusively for BTC transactions and absolutely nothing else running on a linux based system.  Encrypt your wallets encrypt your hard drive back everything up several times etc.

I don't think 2 factor auth is useless.  I think her system was compromised.

Right, so is it possible to validate a transaction in an isolated manner.  Lets say I just had one computer and I pointed it to the transaction and said validate just that transaction.  It wouldn't be mining it would just simply validate the transaction and nothing more not even attempt to write it to the blockchain (it really couldn't anyway)  
This way you could accept an unconfirmed transaction nearly instantaneously.  Then you could be pretty confident in the transaction without it actually being official yet.

Higher level languages deliver better code faster.  The advantages C offers can be delivered on and then some by using a statically typed language over a dynamically typed one along with proper architecture.

Also... the second a decentralized exchange comes online ... then what... tainted coins will be rejected... then someone will make a decentralized exchange where the tainted coins are accepted and mixed in.  
Not to mention now you could even do this with btc-e ... many coins might very well already be tainted and people who had tainted coins can have clean ones.  They might be able to manipulate exchanges located in the US... good luck fucking with shit in Russia and China.

Most places accept credit cards yes?  So buying milk at the store with bitcoin vs. using a credit or debit card. 
All that is occurring is the card company notes this transaction has been logged... done. The transaction isn't complete.  The card holder can reverse it for however many days.  Lets say 45 days.  If the business owner withdraws that money and uses it and the transaction is reversed then that money comes out of his account potentially with a chargeback fee.
So confirmation that the blockchain acknowledges your transaction is instant just like the visa card.  However the transaction being complete in 10 minutes or even an hour or 2 is SIGNIFICANTLY faster then the months it takes for Visa to do it. 
I'd have more faith in a 0 transaction confirmation than a cc

Please explain to me why you'd need 12%?  You realize when money is deflated the purchasing power goes up.  This occurs in a savings account or in your mattress.  You can go to your savings account and get all your money out.  
So in your mattress you get 7% increase in purchasing power.  In a savings account you get that + what ever interest offered.

I actually disagree.  I think buying a miner is a good idea.  In fact you should only buy the 5ghs.   For example if you wanted 50 gighashes you're better off getting 10 5 ghses.  You know no single point of failure.
Based on my calculations you'll make your money back no problem.  Bitcoin is going to shootup in price and 5ghs will still produce plenty of power when bitcoins are worth like 500 dollars a pop.

Okay I get it.  This really isn't about separating yourself from silk road or making yourself more viable in an international marketplace to be a "legitimate" bitcoin marketplace like ebay.  It's not even really about not selling items that are designed cause harm to other individuals because knives and swords meet those qualifications.  
Using a gun to cause harm to someone isn't always bad.  I think it's a good thing when a person defends his or her self.  
It's good to see though that you're not overtly against gun owners and mags and other accessories can still be traded there.  I really appreciate this and while I am uncomfortable with the logical inconsistency in the rules I no longer see it as an outright political attack on firearms and am looking forward to your launch.  
I completely agree with you about drug use.  If a person wants to use drugs that is their choice.  However, I think completely separating  yourself from silkroad and banning a wider array of items that are available on your marketplace would be more successful and it would help the bitcoin community in an epic manner.  Like eBay or Amazon big and it would drive the value of bitcoin skyhigh, but maybe that's for your phase two after you've collected a good number of bitcoins :)

right now its an arms race and we are still trying to find a point where the difficulty adjustments are normal ~10% then your average person might be able to mine at home for a slight profit. 
I don't care about USD.  If I spend 1 btc now and that's 1000 dollars... and 6 months from now I buy a miner and 1 btc is 5000 dollars and that miner returns .3 btc You call that profit?

Whatever some idiot is willing to pay for it.
@_date: 2013-10-31 10:07:43
1.  If the merchant is okay with accepting unconfirmed transactions then the process really should take about the same amount of time as a credit card.  For 1 confirmation it should only take a minute or so typically.  
2.  There is absolutely no reason to VPN into anything.  The IT guy securely gives you the BTC address and you confirm.  You can do this through gtalk using OTR and a phone call.  Once you have their address you simply send it to the address and job done.  BTC is transferred in minutes not days.
Also, you can get a paper wallet in seconds.  There are application wallets that don't require you to download they blockchain.
3. I don't even understand what you're getting at here.
4. As for your understanding of economics... you're taking one theory on economics as scientific fact.  Austrian economics disagrees with pretty much your entire argument here.  
Inflation is bad because it makes it so that I don't want to save money.  Why the hell would I want to save 100K when it's going to lose 5% of it's purchasing power sitting in an investment making me maybe 3-8% ... Maybe I could make 15% but I could also lose 15% with that investment.  All while all the money I'm "earning" in interest also has a depreciated value.  
Deflation encourages saving.  It encourages investing.  Typically people don't keep money in their mattresses.  They keep it in banks... Now it use to be banks would take this money and invest it into things like businesses , homes, and cars etc. etc.  All of which contribute to job creation. Then a portion of the interest charged on those loans would go back to the bank account of the people saving money.  This isn't what is going on in our system today because of government's control over the money supply.  Now banks are just getting money from the fed at cheap rates and saving your money in a bank loses you purchasing power every year.  
So if something can be done in China or elsewhere for cheaper great... that frees up resources to work on new things here.
5.  If you forget a password it could be pretty trivial to crack.  If you lose the wallet entirely then they are gone forever.  That's fine because the price of btc is determined by its scarcity.  People might not be able to estimate how many btc are truly lost, but the free market can. 
To your last point ... There are many exchanges and there is really only so much you can manipulate the price of btc.  Accounting for the cost of transferring fiat between exchanges the exchanges keep pretty much in sync.  Sure they can skim 1%-3% here and there, but that's far less damaging than the manipulation that goes on in the NYSE everyday. 
You haven't pointed out any flaws in bitcoin... maybe potential issues with the market... and maybe a problem or two that this new market hasn't figured out yet... but it's 4 freaking years old.  What did you accomplish at 4 give it a break.  It's competition to fiat and competition economics will tell you is a good thing.  
So anyway.. I'm happy for you coming to your conclusion.  Bitcoin does have an intelligence barrier to entry.  You have to be able to really learn about it and have some basic computer/security knowledge to work with it.  After all you're taking the responsibility that your banks, insurance companies take in securing your fiat and if they fail they get bailed out by the government... or at least your account might.  
Judging by this post you're probably haven't met the intellectual dues to really work and enjoy BTC... we look forward to working with you in the future when your account is paid in full. 
Oh ... and BTC is well regulated by the network.  I don't call having a gang of thugs on call to enforce a set of rules that picks winners and losers.  Picking winners and losers should be solely up to the free market.

No, I'd say we're still on schedule.  Realistically BTC is only up 700%... factoring in the devaluation of the dollar.  The schedule just didn't account for the rapid depreciation of the dollar.

You're connecting it to fiat... I don't care about fiat I care about btc. 
I ran the numbers.  Even with free electricity paying 3 USD for 1 ghs you'll never mine as much btc as you would have had if you simply bought the 3 dollars worth of btc.  Assuming perfect mining conditions ... IE 100% uptime.  You're still going to only make a .66% ROI in BTC.

There is a difference between being an dick and being an asshole.  
An asshole actually tries to fuck you over.  If someone is mentally unbalanced and you rib them on something that you know they are sensitive about... you're an asshole.  If you try and or do something that will cause someone else undo loss ... you're an asshole.
Simple ribbing of someone is a humorous way of letting someone know they are a bit off in their behavior and should probably check themselves.  It also has the benefit of exercising a person's ability to distinguish between shit that matters and shit that doesn't matter. 
My ribbing of you seems to have inspired you feel uneasy about your mode of conduct hence you've felt it necessary to delete your comment that I responded to above.

Sometimes? 
Do not buy from BFL you're throwing your money away.  If you want to invest buying btc is the best route to go.  If you want to mine there are better options available.  Getting those little usb miners while still not a great option is better than BFL.  
KNCMiner is probably the best company to buy from.  Currently they are sold out until March though so you'll have to wait a while to buy from them.  You might be able to buy one 2nd hand, but keep in mind you'll most likely always be better off simply buying btc.  Be very careful buying from an individual I would strongly advise using a trusted escrow.

So bitcoins are currently worth $200 USD.  If they were easy to obtain where would that kind of value come from?  
You can get bitcoins in 2 ways.  Mining them or buying them.  Mining started with CPUs, then GPUs made mining with CPUs prohibitively expensive.  Now we have ASICs which made mining with GPUs prohibitively expensive.
So no you really don't own any hardware capable of mining bitcoins.  There still maybe some sites that will pay you a little BTC for looking at ads I don't know.  Use google.  
So the other way is buying them which doesn't help you if you've got zero in your bank.

I own a KNC right now.  I love them.  However seriously.. don't get into mining right now unless you're looking to lose a bunch of money.  I'll never get my BTC ROI and I'm kicking myself because of it.  
If you really want to get in on mining I'd look at cointerra.  It's a flat out gamble because they could be BFL 2.0 or worse.  While KNC is top right now it's really too late to get in on it if you want any sort of ROI fiat or BTC.  You could also wait till KNC's next gen.

This isn't a sprint man it's a ultra-marathon.  So pound your gu (buy more bitcoin and cost/average) and wait it out.  It's going to be 2-3 more years but BTC will hit 1000 then it will take a shit to 300 cycle rinse repeat or maybe it wont... either way it's going to go up eventually as the fundamentals are strong. 
@_date: 2013-12-08 05:05:10
It was a strategically timed dump.  Yeah it sucks .. but the reality of the matter is this is good news.
Someone who is just going to do a market order on 25k btc... is doing so in order to induce panic selling.  If he really wanted to cash out at 1200 he'd gradually take a few coins every few minutes as to not tank the market.
This person tanked the market and is slowly buying back all his/her coins and taking the profit or buying more coins.

Or simply reading the terms of the deposit method he chose.  As I recall there was no way to get USD into btc-e for like less than about 5% which is about what the OP was charged.
If there was a way to get USD into BTC-e cheaply the price would be closer to mtgox due to arbitrage.  
Most people simply deposit btc into btc-e then transfer it out to another exchange where the deposit/withdraw fee is cheaper and more straight forward.

The house max allowed us to double the minimum bet 7 times.  We brought extra people to get higher than that.  The most we had to bet was 8 times.  
We'd go in win 25 bucks and then play with that until we lost.  I won, my other friend lost.

Mining is tough.  I speculate that it's going to get easier next year... HOWEVER!!!!!!! there is no guarantee.  I just realized today why my estimation for the hashrate increase was off by 3% and it's because some new company shipped some ASICs... Now I have to investigate and adjust my estimates i'm pissed.
Most of KNC's competitors seem to be small frys.  KNC is going to dump a fuckton of hashrate on the market when they ship March/April/May.. no idea .. but a serious fuckton.. If you're not first in line forget about it.  A minimum of 7PH... that's the entire network today. Frankly I don't see anyone else delivering in that quantity before they ship.  It could literally be twice that. 
Now.. here's the real deal... It's soo much easier to just buy it... secure it... forget about it for a year.  This has 2 strategic advantages.  If you put your 20k into BTC and come back in a year maybe now it's 200k... well you're going to be a lot more comfortable throwing 20 grand at top end mining hardware.

If you're putting up a lot of money then use a dedicated box for bitcoin. Literally all it is used for is trading mining and transactions. nothing else not even bitcoin research... Especially bitcoin research. Backing up, stiff firewalls, and encryption are your friends.  Backup offsite too.
When sending money to your exchanges double check the address in two environments if possible. Or send a small transaction first verify the address works then send the rest. 
Look banking has been around for thousands of years and security is a big fucking deal. Banks pay billions every year to make sure their systems are secure. They still fail now and
then. If you're going to be your own bank put some real effort into security.

So saying a bitcoin wallet and address .. is redundant.  A wallet has a public key (the address) and a private key which is used to process transactions. 
You might use  to make an offline wallet.  
That's all well and good... but really the only way to keep it anonymous would be to use a method to mask your IP address when you access it.  
If you only view it via tor or something like that then there is no way to connect you to the address.  Then you'd have to maybe mine through slush's pool or something like that while using a pool... Maybe some how trade through whatever proxy you want etc. This could be tricky as most exchanges require you to do some sort of KYC verification.

Mining is a risky cold hearted bitch of an investment and unforgiving too.  You're likely not going to see an ROI without a lot of luck and money.

So here's my problem.  Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency.  I'm not really sure what ripple is exactly, but it seems like another altcoin that is ran by a single organization that has severs around the world.  
Mining is how transactions get processed by bitcoin.  
So when you say bitcoin client I think Bitcoin-QT, electrum, blockchain.info etc.  The client manages a ledger, shows the user their balance, and allows them to send money.  It does nothing to process the transactions other than request that money from wallet A get sent to wallet B.  
Does your idea piggyback on bitcoin? 
@_date: 2013-12-10 08:53:48
If he goes big like a KNC neptunes I think he'll be fine.  Reputable dealer and a new generation of ASIC.  However that's a substantial gamble. 
People go based on past events and are like oh it's skyrocketing (the difficulty) it's never going to go down.. but they don't take the time to see how the difficulty is calculated who is putting out ASICs and how many they are going to produce.  
The network hashrate is 6PH... we're not going to hit the 120 PH required to hit 21 billion in difficulty by april.  IE early next year shit's going to level off and those logarithmic estimates will be proven to be inaccurate.  
If he tires to do the block eruptors he'll make fiat profit.. but only due to the rise in price of bitcoin.. so he'd be substantially better off simply buying bitcoin.
the last diff change was 16%  19% before that .. this one will be ~28% The one after that will be ~10% at most ~15%
@_date: 2013-11-10 15:47:02
Well it depends on what pool you're with and your payment option... if you're PPS (Pay per share) then for each share you do for that block you get a cut of it... a very small sliver.  
It doesn't matter if you find a block or someone else in the pool finds a block.  You still get paid the same amount.
However if you are mining solo then you don't get paid until you find a block.. and that's pretty much not going to happen.

Price stability isn't an issue.  Merchants who want to accept btc can either use coinbase or bitpay and they are completely insulated from the price fluctuation.  As more merchants become real diehard bitcoin enthusiasts they will simply keep enough money aside to run their business and keep the BTC.. then take the profits 6 months when the price increases and continue on.
We have moderate inflation... 2016x25 every 2 weeks... that's moderate... what the Fed is doing is batshit insane.  Inflation is the expansion of the monetary base.  People get this confused with the bogus term "price inflation" because one way inflation hurts the monetary user is rising prices through decreased purchasing power.  Did bitcoin receive a  50% inflation rate over the weekend?  No the value just decreased.  The outcome was the same, but for different reasons.  Another way inflation shows itself is it keeps prices from falling.  So if a product requires 10 skilled worker hours to develop now and 6 months from now the market changes to where only 1 skilled worker hour is required then you'd expect through competition the market would find a cheaper product... but as technology increases and continually makes production of things cheaper and cheaper we're not experiencing lower prices really in any market.  
Also... inflation being good for an economy is a lie.  Sure no one wants to wait to spend their money ... but then no one is saving... no one is investing in new businesses etc. etc. What does this mean.. it means we're dependent on the monetary controller IE government to take care of the people when we don't save IE social security.. fund banks to invest in markets to make new jobs rather than people saving to do that... Then bail the banks out when they fuck up the economy.  
Marketshare fragmentation will have to be handled over time.  Potentially decades.  
To further reinforce my point that inflation is bad.  Inflation in this context is the real definition of the word expanding the monetary base.  The main argument is "why would you spend it if in 6 month's you can get it for cheaper" ... well this assumes that buying an item now is as good as buying an item 6 months from now.  For things like food... well you can't go 6 months without food...  The cost/benefit analysis here is very clear.  Buying a TV 6 months from now is doable... cost less... but you're also paying 6 months of not enjoying the new television... So instead what was that money used for... well perhaps to invest in a new business... perhaps paying off some debts.  These are things that contribute to the economy just maybe not directly in a manner which a government manipulated formula is going to take advantage of.   Also... consumers being more diligent about their consumption of goods is beneficial to society with respect to the society requiring less social welfare.

Bitcoin is a online ledger.  It says this address has this many bitcoins.  To send money to another address you update the ledger and signing that you agree like signing your signature, but much more secure.  So a bitcoin is just a unit an arbitrary number that is assigned to a ledger.
Currently there are almost 12 million of these units of bitcoins assigned to many many different addresses.  
New units of bitcoin are added by miners solving what is called a block.  Basically it's playing a lottery with your processing power.  More times you play the greater the chances you'll win.  You can't just make bitcoins out of thin air, because no one on the network will agree with you and wont save it to the ledger to be backed up across the world.  You must win the lottery or have someone who owns an address with bitcoins sign a transaction sending the bitcoins to you by updating the ledger.

It's not a big deal.  It's just where we are.  Businesses need to cash out a good amount to deal with paying bills.
There are a few retailers that are trying to hold onto some btc for speculative reasons.  
Motivation for this will come more apparent in a few years when mining returns to being outside of the commoner's hands. 
Fuck visa/mastercard we don't need them.  It's incompatible with the BTC monetary system.
We have bank accounts .. we call them wallets.  The currency exchange isn't necessary.  Kind of defeats the purpose of what you're talking about.

@_date: 2013-11-05 02:02:23
Whenever you're dealing with any online entity and BTC ... use 2FA.. if it isn't offered don't use that site.
I strongly recommend you invest in a new computer.  Install linux on it and do all btc related activities on it exclusively.  No where else.  PERIOD.
A paper wallet is basically a public key and a private key.  The public key is where you send BTC to.  The private key is how you sign the transactions to send BTC.  
Creating an offline paper wallet is the safest place for you to keep your private key.  Bitaddress.org is pretty good.  You can load that site. Go offline and make your wallet.  Then to use it blockchain might be the easiest method, but if you have a few hours you might be able to teach yourself how to use bitcoin-QT to do it. 
Setting up an xbmcubuntu media center is a fun way to learn linux in my experience.  It's a lot more user friendly then you might imagine... it's just a lot of googling to learn how to do what you want.  The added security with regards to dealing with BTC is priceless.

@_date: 2013-10-26 11:52:25
No.  You got something way more valuable than mining.  A lesson.   Scammers are great because they bleed out the stupid out of the market quick.  Either you get hip to whats going on or you stop playing until they pull out the kiddie pool for you.  
Don't get me wrong.  Scammers are assholes and I believe they deserve to a special place in hell reserved for child molesters and people who talk in the theater. 
Bitcoin is well regulated, but that regulation puts the onus of consumer protection entirely on the consumer.  Who loses out for stupidity.  The consumer.  Same with merchants too.  SO! why is it good for bitcoin?  Because it brings stability to the market and the propagation of safety practices.   Like using linux, strong passwords, different user names, and 2fa.   And not paying 83 a ghs when a decent calculator with optimistic values tells you it will make an entirety 47 dollars when btc is at 150.  (mind you optimistic or rather chance in hell.  Now realistically you're looking at 30 bucks total)
Stupidity hurts btc more than anything.  Panic selling losing all your btc to a scammer or forever.  BTC is a paradigm shift.  You need to take responsibility for your security like you haven't had to in the past.  Understand the math and the market so big ups and downs don't affect you.

@_date: 2013-06-07 00:12:05
To add to this.  While by the time a 5GH/s gets in your hands it will probably take 3 months to break even.. that's assuming btc is only worth 130.  If you believe that the value of BTC is 1000 then that's a reasonable avenue.  
So my opinion is if you can afford a 5/ghs and your goal is to make BTC and not recoupe your investment for like 5 years then it's worth getting IMHO.  If you're looking for extra cash.. nope nope nope.

Good luck man.  
Now we know KNC delivered and they had their hiccups...basically if you weren't a Day 1 or 2 with shipping you got hosed.  
What makes you think HashFast or Cointerra aren't going to face the same sorts of hiccups?  Also it's too late to be a Day 1 customer with any of those companies.
I'm not saying people should or shouldn't mine.  I mine and I think it's great fun and I haven't been hosed personally.  However that being said I realize the risk and really encourage people to consider the reality that they will likely never see a BTC ROI on their miners.

Yeah you're not talking about a client you're talking about an altcoin.  The bulk of your development would be in the mining.  That's beyond my capability to do in a couple weeks.  Litecoin has a faster transaction than bitcoin.  The big problem that has been talked about by the creator of litecoin is verifying transactions in a timely manner while ensuring no coins are double spent.  This seems to be a problem inherent to the distributive nature of cryptocoins which gives them their robustness. 
The real solution to this would be to have a trusted mediator like "Visa" where you'd load your bitcoin debit card with BTC which takes 10 minutes (much faster than transferring money into a bank account). Then simply debit and credit the accounts of the consumer and vendor respectively.   Campbx and Mtgox are both capable of transferring BTC in house instantly.  The problem here is now it's all based on a centralized regulator rather than a distributed one.  Which means you could run into a Liberty Reserve situation if the government decides to shut them down.

Well that really depends on the price per bitcoin.  Lets assume 100/bitcoin well if that's the case you'll probably pay that off by the end of January 2014.  By April you might even make 5 coins so call that a 500 dollar profit.  However.. if the price of bitcoins tanks you'll need to wait it out.  If it tanks to 30 a coin you'll break even end of march 2014 and by the end of april you might have 30 dollar profit.

I don't understand that I'm a day 1 5XX with a pre-order.  My expectation was they build my miner... ship it to the datacenter and have it up and running and hashing that day in a pool.  
If the web portal site wasn't up My expectation didn't change.  I still wanted my miner setup with a pool hashing away even if I didn't have access to it.  When web portal was completed.. then switch me over and give me the mined bitcoins.  I'd have been happy as a clam.  
I'm already not expecting to see an ROI and that's okay.. but to miss out on 3-5 days or more of mining is a big fucking deal and honestly I want a refund for those missed days.  It's inexcusable in my opinion.
Fucking hell how hard is it to setup port routing and give me an ssh login to tunnel to my machine.  You know if they really wanted to give us access w/o the portal being setup.

Bitcoin is international dipshit.  If Gavin goes over to the dark side then another will take his place.  All that would have to happen is no one upgrades.  My miner.. wouldn't upgrade and they can fork it and make their altcoin and call it whatever the fuck they want.  MtGox BTCChina Btc-e so on and so forth would just continue on with the real blockchain and they can all sing happy happy thoughts along with you.

Rising prices of goods is a symptom of inflating the currency supply.  Inflate... to expand.  You blow into a balloon and it expands.  You print more money and you expand the money supply.  
The problem with looking at inflation through the narrow lens of rising prices is that inflation can present itself in different ways.  For example in a market like technology where products and services are forever becoming cheaper and cheaper inflation will slow down the reduction in price those goods and services would have if the monetary system wasn't being expanded or inflated.
