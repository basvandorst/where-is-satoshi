you don't want your currency to deflate though, you want it to inflate at the slowest rate possible. Otherwise you make holding the money a way to profit, but economies are run by people spending money. Inflation forces you to spend money now, or asap, while deflation rewards those that wait. If everyone waits, the economy locks up, and nothing is spent, people close down, less jobs, people don't spend, etc, etc, etc. This is what happened early in our history and why we have a pro-inflation policy now. 
I am all for deflationary assests, but currency shouldn't be that. Currency should be a way to temporarily store value between exchange of goods and services, and hording money should come with a penalty. That is what a currency should be. What value does a currency really hold? just like paper dollars, you can maybe set it on fire, maybe eat it, but there isn't much value in the physical dollar. This is done on purpose, so you don't horde it. 
Anyway, I think the deflationary aspect is more or less the reason why I don't want to use it.

That isn't true, he can value apple and google. He can't value things like facebook and twitter, or social media, because they offer no real service. They serve no need. Google is a search engine, it is a service. 
That is why he is okay with it as a service for transferring money, just not as a place to hold money.

So this thing came out in like 2002, called online payments. My bank allows me to do this easily, to anyone, to any account. My bank is a small credit union. I think you can find online payments at your bank as well. 
your example is basically moot, as it offers no advantage over the current system other than some people might not know how to set it up, but that is the same problem with bitcoin.
But speaking of time and money, what about buying a bitcoin, then paying rent? What if the price drops 30%, rent is 1100/mo, or 2 bitcoins, but bitcoin tanks in the 5 days between when I (the renter) buy it and then pay rent with it. How do you, as a landlord, ensure you are getting fair market value out of your rental if the price of bitcoin changes daily?
Websites are setup to recalculate the value of bitcoin hourly, but you are asking for 1 month rent, are you calculating the value of the property hourly?

I don't know the companies I work with that well. I might have had many good experiences, but I have had companies rip me off years after I was a customer. My internet company decided to kill my internet, then charge me a cancellation fee. After correcting it, they still wanted to charge me the fee for their mistake. I had been with them for 5 years. 
So previous history doesn't make me feel safer. Only if I knew the person, at which point why wouldn't a credit card work? or better yet, why not just pay in cash?

I must be mistaken, can you explain more? Banks cannot create their own money now, they can loan out in excess of the principle, sure, but if BoA wanted to loan out 15B, they can't just do it, they must follow guidelines set by the Federal Reserve. So in essence, only the fed can create or give permission to create. Greenspans idea for fixing our crash is to require more capital for banks, making their risk portfolio go down. That would change how much a bank can loan above and beyond deposits.
So a bank run though, is the mass removal of capital. The bank crashed when capital is requested while it is loaned out. So if we could loan out bitcoins, and suddenly everyone started calling in their debts, you would have the same thing. Hell, we see the same thing now, if you are valued at say 1M worth of bitcoins, and suddenly 60% decide to sell, what happens to the value? what if you are using bitcoins as collateral? now that collateral is worthless (or worth less). 
So I guess I don't see how you can't have bitcoin suddenly crash, losing all value. What prevents my coin currently at value of 600 from dropping to 1 dollar a coin? Because that is basically what a bank run did to people, reduced their savings to pennies on the dollar.

and beanie babies, my family and friends were huge in it, had easily 5k invested in those things. Now they sell for about a nickle each. Their 5k investment is worth maybe 10 bucks today.

investment money is money being used, which is good. You cannot invest bitcoins, they are the investment. There is no fractal banking system for bitcoins, hence it holds value.
Sure, you can invest to beat inflation, but what I was pointing out is like with bitcoin, to not invest to risk nothing, the money is worth more. Even wealthy people who invest must choose a stock / company that will yield results, they don't just invest in anything.

which to be fair is why we had bank runs back 100 years ago, and had them often. People fearful their deposits would no longer be there, or the value would basically drop to zero. 
Once FDIC was issued, bank runs are a thing of the past. This seems to just be warning saying, "Hey, we aren't going to insure this currency." I guess it is basically a buyer beware.

hording fiat will lose you money due to inflation. There is basically a tax on sitting money.

well, seeing as i produce at least a turd a day, it lacks scarcity. Same reason smooth rocks are not a currency.

it's a currency, why are you selling it? Do you ask when you should sell your dollars?

let's not forget during the crash, gold was predicted to reach 3200 an ounce, easily. All the gold bugs claimed it would only go up, it was "correcting". Many people said it was pure speculation and would crash.
Today it is 1200, it peaked at 1800, and has no signs of going up to 1800 anytime soon. 
At least in this case, many gold investors said the EXPERTS were wrong, but it turned out the experts were very right.
