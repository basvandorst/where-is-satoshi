You could just look at it the opposite way, which is probably what people will do, and that is:
Why not buy? After all, my coins will go up in value      tomorrow, covering the cost of today's purchase..
Assuming we collar our spending habits to the essentials and a few small luxuries, like others have commented.
(The drop in production and it's economic impact can also be balanced, but that's a different post topic)

Do tell me more. I like real go-getting projects and bridge selling stories alike. 
@_date: 2019-03-12 23:11:35
What? 
@_date: 2019-03-13 06:17:24
This my thought, too. I'm trying to educate myself and incorporate it into my website.
Been a fan of decentralization for awhile. 
@_date: 2019-03-12 21:55:38
How can you be so sure? 
@_date: 2019-03-16 01:11:06
Apparently, I did not.

How does one "go foreign"?
@_date: 2019-03-16 01:13:16
I am, but I also like to learn. Thank you.
@_date: 2019-03-28 05:31:20
FB behavior probably won't work here (Reddit), in the long term.
Just saying.
@_date: 2019-03-07 15:23:08
Thanks. TIL about Harlon's Razor.

BadaBoom. 
@_date: 2019-03-12 21:11:55
Thanks for the informative words.
@_date: 2019-03-12 23:07:51
Thanks.  ...seems to be in my price range, too. ��
@_date: 2019-03-12 23:22:27
@_date: 2019-03-17 21:31:32
Ok. Thank you for the reply.
@_date: 2019-03-16 00:21:51
The analogy is not about cars..... It's about questions.
@_date: 2019-03-16 06:19:04
Why exactly, to prevent thieves? Or to prevent something more sinister?
@_date: 2019-03-16 00:16:21
Yes, I understand it's on the German Stock Exchange.
The question is not how to buy similar "local" ETFs, but how to invest in the foreign ones.
Like, telling me to buy a Chevy, does not answer the question of where/how to buy a Volkswagen, ya know?
@_date: 2019-03-12 22:04:11
No, no. I'm not educated enough to argue otherwise. Honestly, I just want to absorb data, including yours, because I have little myself. 
@_date: 2019-02-25 19:35:11
Thank you.
@_date: 2019-02-28 13:52:31
Thanks, but no thanks, unless your capable of working with Shopify sites.
@_date: 2019-02-25 19:34:02
Thank you! 
@_date: 2019-02-25 23:18:57
..or would this connection to Shopify make the funds vulnerable? 
@_date: 2019-02-25 23:17:24
Excellent. Thank you, u/thegreatmuffin .... and all this would be extremely safe, I assume? I could just leave the Bitcoin alone and let them become a sort of savings account?
@_date: 2019-02-25 20:00:37
Wow, cool! No idea how that works, but I get that I was tipped 10 of the smallest units of Bitcoin. Is this for real  or a "for fun" Reddit thing? 
@_date: 2019-02-25 19:35:32
I'm using Shopify if it makes a difference.
@_date: 2019-02-25 23:34:25
Is there a simple an easy way to explain why? u/Rustybootstraps ?
@_date: 2019-02-25 19:34:58
Thanks. Yes, I will go this direction.
@_date: 2019-02-25 23:45:20
Ugh.. ..which would you recommend? u/g1g0byte ?
@_date: 2019-02-25 21:21:13
Ok, once I setup all this up, what is a good daily method of operation? Should I transfer all coins to a hard wallet daily?
@_date: 2019-02-25 22:36:21
Should I convert to dollar daily or otherwise transfer to a hard wallet daily? Or after a certain amount? 
@_date: 2019-02-25 23:31:34
Yes, I've been "sponging-up" all the knowledge I can recently, including the safety/security measures you are referring to.
I'll continue to educate myself for another week or two, then start.
Thank you very much for the response/s.
@_date: 2019-04-02 23:13:30
Which one deals in bcash?
Edit: Also, those are my integration options, not my current website checkout options.
@_date: 2019-04-03 01:27:11
I'm using Shopify and wanting to use their integration system.
@_date: 2019-04-03 15:30:43
Yes, Shopify has it's downsides, subscription fees being one of them. But I do love the constant developing effort they put in and the general course of direction they are heading.. and the speed at which they are doing both.
@_date: 2019-04-05 18:25:04
@_date: 2019-04-02 23:12:56
..would it be so unforgivable to start with the business easy side of integration, then evolve from there?
Edit: Also, I love this route, I do. I really, really do. I do.
@_date: 2019-04-02 23:49:59


... burn the entire store because they sell loli porn? 
Or just ignore the rotten apples as you begrudgingly buy lettuce?
@_date: 2019-04-03 15:16:53
Is there a way to be funnier and less predictable with replies in 2019? 
@_date: 2019-04-08 17:58:14
Thanks for the response. Seriously.
However,  I was hoping for answers or at least a more in-depth opinionated response...   ...to my questions.
@_date: 2019-04-02 18:25:22
Thanks. 
My demographic loves crypto. But by that same token, will hate me for using the wrong payment solutions..
@_date: 2019-04-15 22:19:12
@_date: 2019-04-02 23:54:02
Just trying to gauge the seriousness of the crime. Feel free to word your own example. 
@_date: 2019-04-03 15:25:04
I don't actually know enough to see the humor or to even tell if you're joking.
....but it feels like troll reply math was used. ����
@_date: 2019-04-07 22:16:53
@_date: 2019-04-08 16:29:28
Or if that's the actual name...
@_date: 2019-04-08 01:14:23
My website just adopted cryto as payment. See you there? 
@_date: 2019-04-25 18:46:05
I added several payment options to my website recently and also made my first purchase using Bitcoin last week
@_date: 2019-04-17 04:51:29
Would it keep you *hard* if they did, u/Phallic ?
@_date: 2019-04-02 18:07:47
Best recommend for EasyThereOldMan Shopify store install?
@_date: 2019-04-03 04:18:45
Is there a 2019 list of sites that accept Bitcoin?
Edit: I mean to ask if there is an updated Reddit fan approved list of websites accepting Bitcoin? In all my years of searching for information I have learned that often the best info is just under the surface, out of the  sight and hands of noobs... I was just curious. 
@_date: 2019-04-09 16:17:30
Thank you. I will look into this today.
@_date: 2019-04-03 15:34:54
...it's a good thing one of us can. 
@_date: 2019-04-05 18:23:58
Do you run an online business? How long?
 I've been selling online since 1999. While I totally understand where you're coming  from philosophically, it's hard not to recognize the amazing power of Shopify. 
It's constant integration with other site and apps makes it extremely useful for smaller businesses.
I have a list of companies I won't ever buy from. McDonald's is one of them. 
...that being said, if a small local business I approve of has an employee who eats McDonald's for lunch, I don't stop frequenting them. 
@_date: 2019-04-02 17:44:46
So, I am too old.. first, I can't figure out how to edit my post (spelling). Second, no, I did not download GA. my bad.
I am open to all suggestions, but keep in mind:
I am running the site on Shopify and need an easy and streamlined checkout.
I'm aware Coinbase and BitPay are on the shtlist, but unaware of how to remedy.
Simple integration is all I'm currently capable of.
@_date: 2019-04-03 15:18:51
Silly idea. It would never work.
