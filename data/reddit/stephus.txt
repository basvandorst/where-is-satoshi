Thanks for the awesome answer. It seems if a bock chain takeover were attempted then the block chain would explode in size very fast.  A call would go out to find the source of the bloat and the block chain could be purged of anything derived from the attacking entity. This makes me feel Bitcoin will survive such a scenario.

A 1,500 GH MiniRig could easily solo mine which would decentralize the network.

For a $25/BTC premium on your BTC sale on MTGox, you get three months of worry that at any time MTGox could go bankrupt and close it's doors forever. If you don't mind loosing 100% of your money then go ahead.

If you are worried your USD will be seized, then withdraw it as cash and bury it. Only you will know where it is buried. 
As for the value of Bitcoin, there is no guarantee it will hold it's value. Nobody is in control of that. But the Federal Reserve acts on behalf of congress to guide the value of USD in order to stabilize the flow of commerce, stimulate job growth, and to maintain an acceptable inflation rate. 
If you don't value your right to vote, I am sorry for you. 
The people of Cyprus benefited greatly from the taxing of foreign deposits in their banks. It paid off their national debt did it not? Perhaps next time they will be more careful borrowing so much money in the form of a currency they don't have direct control over. But is their choice to participate in the Euro and they must weigh the benefits of that participation against other options.

I didn't read anything about using the satellites to mine bitcoin. However, due to general relativity, and the gravity/time differential between a grounded mining rig and an orbital one, you could crank out a few billionths of a percent more hashes in orbit!

Assuming most ASIC mining chips are being manufactured in China, one could conclude that Chinese chip manufacturers will be complaining loudly to the Chinese government. It would be amazing if Bitcoin were to be the trigger for major monetary policy change in China. On the other hand, if China proves serious about stamping out Bitcoin, it could ban ASIC mining manufacture. It would be amazing again if Bitcoin were to be the trigger for moving chip manufacturing out of China.

While this could happen, it would not be the end of Bitcoin. Pool operators under attack would shut down their pools and any double spent coins would quickly get erased automatically by the rest of the network. The only coins the attacker would get access to would be each pools total rewards uncashed by pool users. Pool users that don't cash out on a regular basis would loose the most, and the pool operators will loose unsecured commissions, a just punishment for both. Double spending would be the hardest attack to succeed since it would require  90% or more total network hash rate for many hours to temporarily succeed. An attacker would be much more likely to steel a single pools earnings as fast as possible before the pool operator noticed then to orchestrate such an elaborate multi pool attack.

"Since the Fed was established in 1913, the dollar has lost 95% of its value". Really? What a ridiculous argument. Anybody still holding their 1913 hard earned dollars is DEAD NOW. A 1913 dollar can only buy you clothes, food, a prostitute, and some soap. A 2013 dollar can buy cell phones, computers, cable internet, electric cars. Why not then save your 2013 dollars for spending in 2113? Because you will be  DEAD then.

If I found out that the pool that I use has gone to the dark side and started reversing transactions or whatever, I would boycott that pool. As long as the word gets out fast enough to stop using that pool, then that pool will loose it's ability to do bad things.

Perhaps I was confusing as to what I consider a 1913 dollar (100 years ago) or a 2113 dollar (100 years from now0. I am making the presumption that the value of a dollar is defined by what it can buy you today. So a 1913 dollar is valued by what it could buy you in 1913. A 2113 dollar is of little consequence to anyone alive today since they will be dead in 2113. And nobody knows what you will be able to purchase in 2113.

A full disassembly of the graphics card for cleaning is so important. For the longest time I just stuck a the straw of can of dust remover into the cracks around the fan. This doesn't work as I learned. When you do a thorough cleaning it's also a good time to clean the old thermal paste out and replace it.

Change the Bitcoin proof of work function to represent a protein that potentially cures cancer. When a miner finds a protein that potentially cures cancer, a hash of the new protein is made along with any valid unconfirmed transactions along with a hash of the current block chain. Transactions become confirmed when the distributed network confirms that the protein potentially cures cancer. As soon as GPU and then ASIC miners get developed, the network automatically adjusts to work on bigger more difficult to solve proteins.

Well if you think your dollars are so useless (since they are not guaranteed by gold or whatever) then you should have no problem giving all your dollars to me. I'm sure I can find something useful to do with them.

**Gold is not perfect**
While gold has been a good investment lately, it has had it's troubles in the past. 
* Owning gold in the US was banned in 1933. 
* Gold coins were taken out of circulation, melted down, and placed in storage (aka Fort Knox). If the USA decided to dump this gold on the market it would probably crash the price.
* The high price of gold has triggered a gold rush, and the increased mining efforts have probably reduced the market value of gold.
* Gold mining is very damaging to the environment. Especially to untouched natural treasures like Alaska and South America.
* Vast quantities of gold are believed to be contained in the earth's core, enough to blanket the surface 1 foot thick. While it seems technically impossible now, someone in the future may devise a method of pumping it up like oil.
* Some asteroids are believed to contain vast quantities of precious metals including gold. NASA already has plans of capturing an asteroid.
**Bitcoin is not perfect**
While Bitcoin has enjoyed stability and popularity lately, lots of things could go wrong.
* A flaw in the encryption used by Bitocin could be discovered nullifying Bitcoin's security.
* Alternates to Bitcoin are released every few weeks. So far only Bitcoin seems to gain value over time, but if an alternate were to catch on it could overtake Bitcoin's total market value fairly quickly.
* The Bitcoin network could be attacked. This has become more evident as pools have taken over a majority of the network.
* If Bitcoin were to become a national security threat, it could be banned just like gold.
* A virus or Trojan horse on your computer could steel all your Bitcoin. 
**US Dollars are not perfect**
The US dollar is an abstract representation of the economic output of the USA and the strength of it's federal government.
* The US government could loose control, possibly by loosing a war.
* Civil war could break out in the USA resulting in all states abandoning the union like what happened to the Soviet Union.
* The USA could fail to counteract it's dependency on foreign oil causing it to loose it's economic power. US dollars would loose value as a result.
* A large asteroid or comet could hit the USA killing millions of people, crippling our infrastructure, and collapsing our financial system.
* The world could decide to cut off all economic ties with the USA like what most of the world did to North Korea.
* The USA could accidentally elect a Nazi like party that succeeds in seizing total control, disbanding congress, the supreme court, and the constitution.

I was thinking they could do some serious damage to Bitcoin if they waited for a difficulty change, mined two weeks worth of coins in say a few hours, and then turned off their fancy quantum computer. The difficulty would then shoot up by a factor of 100X making transaction confirmations take days instead of 10 minutes. And it would be a year before the difficulty would change back down. That is assuming anybody would be left motivated enough to mine at such a high difficulty. If no other quantum computers entered to save the day it could kill Bitcoin forever!
Have no fear though. Quantum computers are no where near flexible enough algorithmically to mine Bitcoin. If they do we will have much more to worry about then the fate of Bitcoin. Like the entire banking system will fail. And super intelligent possibly sentient robots will take over the planet Matrix style.

I would like to see a chart of US$ equivalent transactions varying with the trade value of Bitcoin at each point in time. To me that would be a good indication of how big the Bitcoin economy is or is not growing. This chart just shows the growth of Satoshi Dice use and subsequent reduction in Satoshi Dice use since the April increase of the minimum transaction fee. There is also no practical way to remove transactions that represent people moving their Bitcoin from one personal wallet to another for security, convenience, or consolidation.

Black holes emit hawking radiation (photons), loosing mass over time. While very large black holes absorb enough cosmic background radiation to counter this effect, as our universe ages the cosmic background radiation will fade away causing all black holes to convert all their mass into radiation eventually.

Bitcoin is not infinitely divisible. One Bitcoin can be divided into 100,000,000 Satoshis. There are 2.1 quadrillion possible Satoshis. So if a Satoshi ever becomes worth $1 USD, then the total value of Bitcoin will be 123 times the national debt. And my 2 Bitcoins will be worth $200 million. I can't wait!

So lets say ASIC miners as a group eventually exceed 51% network hash rate. Then some committee decides to change the proof of work function. How many ASIC miners are going to update their Bitcoin servers to use the new function? Zero.

* Just because the government does something that is not in the constitution does not make it unconstitutional. If you believe a law to be unconstitutional, then you may petition the Supreme Court to make your case.
* There isn't a single government on planet Earth that bases it's currency on the gold standard any more.
* I do believe that the US government has the right to force businesses located in the USA to conduct business in US currency. Also, all workers located in the USA must be paid in US currency and never have their paycheck indexed to a foreign currency. I'm not sure if it is illegal to pay workers using gold though. I doubt that would be very popular with most workers. Would you like your paycheck to be a fixed amount of Bitcoin? What if Bitcoin tanked in value? What if Bitcoin soared in value so high your employer was forced to fire you?
