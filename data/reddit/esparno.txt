It doesn't look like they had any fire suppression system so I highly doubt they were insured for this amount.

I was speaking about what was relevant to me.  I do not feel comfortable making comments on other countries that I have done no research on.  While I am sure that some of the stories I've heard of the prisons in other countries are accurate I wasn't trying to comment on them due to that.  But yes, you're right in that the abuse of prisoners is a systemic problem not endemic to the US alone.
We need to stop accepting "It's always been that way" as an excuse when we have an infrastructure capable of trading ideas freely (the internet).

I knew someone would mention the heartbleed bug.  Sure, these things happen, bugs get propagated by established libraries.  You're missing the point, it was fixed *because* it was open source.  If it weren't open source the independent security company wouldn't have discovered it.
The level of severity that the heartbleed bug occupies is several orders of magnitude above anything that has affected this many WAN-facing services/applications in a very long time.
If you have any education about probability or common cognitive biases you would realize that you've made a mistake.
You are assigning more weight to the most recent major vulnerability, and using that as your basis that ALL open source is as vulnerable.  This is not a logical conclusion given the context it takes place in, the infrastructure of the internet is full of widely adopted open source projects being used in secure environments.
Open source code may or may not be vulnerable, but one of the pros of the open source movement is that more vulnerabilities will be found and fixed due to there being more eyes on it.  Personally I think the vast majority of applications are vulnerable on some level, but most are vulnerable to attacks requiring messing with the memory the program occupies (not a practical attack vector).

Just like with bankers, my belief is that financial crimes of this magnitude should be persecuted with the same aggression that manslaughter or murder cases are.
The reasoning behind this is that financial crimes can impact the lives of people who were relying on that money just like that person suddenly dying.  It's not just that families alone can be ruined, entire businesses can crumble ruining the lives of dozens or hundreds of families.  
In these types of situations if it were quantifiable the net emotional impact is arguably just as large as that of a death or deaths.

You shouldn't claim to be an IT guy while making such statements, it makes you look silly.

That said, the rape problem in US prisons isn't something we should be wishing on other human beings.  It's real easy to forget that it's actually happening until you realize that since the legal system convicts innocent people that what you're really doing is glorifying ***cruel and unusual*** punishment to American citizens that don't deserve it.
Prisoners are human beings.  It's absolute bullshit that in 20-fucking-14 there is still abuse going on in prisons and I'm just tired of chuckle-fucks herp-derping at the idea of getting raped in prison like it's ok.

What's most likely is that you're just some fucking immature brat with a narrow and malformed world-view.  
Here's a crash course on ethics to get through your apparently thick skull:  Calling for mass murder "for the greater good of society" only works out for you while you're on the winning side.  What happens when people get upset that you're doing this, gotta kill them too eh?  Eventually you're overwhelmed by enemies you have created, all because you're too stupid to come up with a solution that incorporates everyone.
I mean, I guess you could develop some sort of contagion and kill off the majority of people...but given the premise you put forth that I'm basing this post off of my guess is that you're either just out of, or still in, high-school.

Now you're just being silly.  You're being disengenuous about the complexities involved in such budgeting.  If you really think budget issues on a state or federal level could be solved as easily as you seem to imply you owe it to the rest of society to run for office on that platform.
Of course if you were to pursue it then most likely you would end up being not educated enough on the subject to even be taken seriously.  But that's just a guess based on the fact that the average person who espouses the beliefs you do is fairly dumb when it comes to economics.  
I believe you called this "Guilty by association" dismissively for some reason.  I don't see how people perceiving others actions based on patterns is a negative thing.  But apparently you do, so that's something to reflect on.

Not without some sort of backing by an established entity, much like the FDIC insuring up to $125,000 of each persons bank account.
The owner could decide with no warning to abscond with any and all of the coins.  If their argument is simply "Well we tell people to only put small amounts in" they are either being disingenuous or ignorant of how much of a temptation a large amount of money really is.
