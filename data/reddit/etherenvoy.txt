Pretty sure it was Nick Szabo and Hal Finney. Two good guys working together on a project that would become bigger than them. The world will miss you, Hal. Thanks for your role in creating this; May it improve our world.
Nick is still around. It is sad he probably will not be made too rich by this.
It is possible that others used this name or that there were investors involved. This allows all parties to be denied the rights to the name.

FUD is discussed as though it is a crime, but it carries no connotation of being false. People are often removed or downvoted for voicing realistic concerns, as though concern itself has been outlawed. I have seen people refer to the fearful posters as concern trolls. Interesting neologisms to say the least.
One phenomena I have observed is people, who are themselves planning to invest, using pessimistic arguments as a way of attracting more optimistic minds to come and calm their worries. The strangeness of this behavior is understandable -- these people crave convincing optimism from others that is tailored to their darkest concerns.
Then there is "false reporting attack news", which is a little different than just a healthy dose of fear or concern. When people or media actively spread misinformation, I do not think it is fear or uncertainty -- but lies.
Maybe call this "fran"? The term fake news is too associated with T_D and has its own meaning in that space. The term FUD is more specific to investor psychology and is not actually used correctly in the case of a media entity spreading lies. The term lies, while accurate, is simply much less specific.

They literally released a statement saying they intend to introduce all of the major ones. I would expect 5 or so additions at a minimum this year.

Does BISQ's roadmap currently plan to support other crypto? Crypto to crypto? Removing the need for any of these shady third parties would be great.

1.5 million transactions per day? you mean, like Ethereum already has?
I think you mean something closer to 600 transactions per second.
