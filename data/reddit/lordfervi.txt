I've got account since 2 years.  
Steem is a network that is ideologically very cool, but in reality it is a massacre. It's actually a Russian labor camp or something.

If you want to get satoshis, you can write posts on [ZapRead.com]( (Blog platform with LN earns). \[It's beta stage, so may be buggy, but works I think very well\]
@_date: 2019-07-01 22:01:40
You should work for Bitcoins :D For example create good content on zapread.com
@_date: 2019-07-09 16:22:47
Sorry, we talking about REAL crypto ;)

Does it seem to me that in the future the Schnorr signatures will help to solve this type of problem or not?

Are you planning to upload the game source code?
@_date: 2019-10-17 21:43:06
Using iOS and OS X instead glorious Android and Linux Master Race ;)

In general, if there were no attacks on the network, you simply close the channel and get tokens on your account.
However (I think so), if there were any attacks then you have proof that you have these tokens and the attacker would have to attack until he opened the channel in Lightning network.
@_date: 2019-10-06 19:16:47
I think that 1 confirmation from LN is ok, because even if there is an attack on the network and it reverses your channel closure, the money will be secured in multisig, which nobody has access to.

Why aren't the Bitcoins interested in RSK? It seems to me that the project may be interesting (as a test field for smart contracts).
@_date: 2019-10-23 12:59:14
Yep, and also it's close source software
@_date: 2019-10-06 17:31:19
This is not recommended ofc. Because LN is still in Beta phase. But yes
@_date: 2019-10-06 17:16:30
1 BTC, But this limit can be disabled.
@_date: 2019-10-05 19:52:47
And they do (and it works). But many people for some reason don't like RSK and I'm wondering, because maybe they're right (and RSK is bad).
@_date: 2019-10-06 14:36:26
The larger the network, the safer it is. Bitcoin's Shitcoin Forks are attacked by 51%. E.g. BGold. What protects Bitcoin is its powerful computational power.
@_date: 2019-10-21 23:10:56
The creator of the project creates many different interesting things on Lightning. Although it would be nice to win and earn, the money does not come from the air (in the sense of Bitcoin, because FIATs from printers).  
It is worth supporting this man, because he paved the way for Lightning before many of today's services were created.
@_date: 2019-10-26 11:28:21
Doesn't this prophecy say that Bitcoin will fall?
@_date: 2019-10-06 14:21:50
Usually coin creators have 51% of tokens (in most or all PoS crypto)
@_date: 2019-12-08 18:39:09
You can deposit some amount on [Zapread.com]( Social media platform using LN
@_date: 2019-12-20 16:32:36
True, although I'd like to support it on a data update basis. You have to enter "milestones" manually, maybe I'll rewrite the avatar download system.
@_date: 2019-12-29 21:42:06
Unfortunately, BCH users are still trying to cheat on people.
In short: Use Lightning instead of 0-conf. Even the magic BCash will not protect you from Double Spends.
@_date: 2019-12-28 21:39:58


Sure, but web wallets are insecure, so you should download a software
@_date: 2019-12-28 21:45:08
Bisq (formerly Bitsquares) is a decentralized and anonymous crypto  exchange. Here you can easily exchange Bitcoin for another crypto or  buy/sell Bitcoin with a Fiat.I'm sorry for poor image quality, but it's Youtube's fault :(
Micro advertising: I'm trying to support new social media based on Bitcoin - [Zapread.com]( It uses Lightning Network to reward entries, the project is Open Source and works very well. Try it for free (you don't have to pay anything).

RSK is Bitcoin sidechain secured by Bitcoin miners.
@_date: 2019-12-21 16:28:06
RSK (RootStock / Smart Bitcoin) is Bitcoin's sidechain, whose goal is to  introduce Ethereum-compatible smart contracts to this platform. With this solution, it will be possible to introduce DeFi or Stablecoin to the Bitcoin.
I'm sorry for poor image quality, but it's Youtube's fault :(
Next time probably Electrum
You can also watch [Zapread.com]( movie: [

The "Bitcoin Gource" project aims to show the development of Bitcoin in a ... cool, colorful. So that the average person who watches this film can see how fast Bitcoin is developing.
[Zapread.com]( is an open source social networking platform based on game theory using the Lightning network. The aim of the project is to create a global, decentralized platform where people create cool content and monetize it, which encourages self-development. In my opinion, the project can compete with Steem platforms, which are rejected by many people due to their slow development and design defects.
**You can register today ;) Of course for free.**
I'm sorry for poor image quality, but it's Youtube's fault :(  
Next time probably RSK or Electrum

14 is not much, but that means that every 10 double spend works. It may depend on technique rather than luck.
@_date: 2019-12-25 14:13:45
Yep. I wanted to promote a new social networking platform powered by Bitcoin, but Reddit doesn't like competition ;)
@_date: 2019-12-22 13:06:17
RSK is one of the projects built around Bitcoin (it uses his architecture), but it is not Bitcoin and Satoshi did not write it.
In the near future there will be a "Bitcoin Core", i.e. the development of the Bitcoin node and Satoshi will be there.
@_date: 2019-12-29 22:27:11
I don't have a date. The Lightning Network support code is in the draft version of Electrum, so probably when the new version comes out, it's with its support.  
Of course you can use this version already if you're in a hurry.

Python is a scripting language, so you don't have to compile it, but yes - download the source and run through a Python interpreter.
@_date: 2019-12-13 01:29:16
Yeah, that's right. But I have a philosophy (someone may not share it) in which we can build solutions together on Bitcoin. These solutions may be weak, but there may be some brilliant ones that will push the technology forward. Like Lightning Network.
@_date: 2019-12-13 19:10:41
No, any miner can dig (merged mining). But not much pools mining does. F2Pool, [BTC.com]( ViaBTC, Slush Pool I think mine RSK.In short, you mine RSK in the same time as BTC, so you don't need other hardware
@_date: 2019-12-26 21:58:12
Well, you can just register on [Zapread.com]( (it's free) and talk.  
I think there is a lot of potential in this project. For 2 years I've done different projects for Shitcoin Steem, which has many disadvantages. Zapread doesn't have them. Some things need to be fixed, but the project itself is definitely worth considering.

It's not MakerDAO, it's MakerDAO competition

It is possible to take 0-confs, of course, but it should not be done.
You should also not use web wallets. And many things. Someone will do it anyway.
@_date: 2019-09-29 23:50:42
Personally, I think that Bitcoin does not need such smart contracts. However, if someone thinks that it would be worth it - let him use RSK, which has it all, has (partial) protection in Bitcoin's network (merge mining) and so on.   
It is possible that something good will come out on RSK.

According to Andreas, consensus must be maintained by five groups: Programmers, miners, users, exchanges and mechants.
Do you have any idea how to solve the problem with a badly working BitPay? Can we influence it? Or should we think about it together?
@_date: 2019-09-26 10:43:43
What do you think about RSK?
@_date: 2019-05-20 11:02:54
That's a very good question. DGameShop is one of our 3 stores, DGameMarket (unfortunately it does not support Bitcoin yet) requires deposits (something like G2A) and we want to unite every account. 
Additionally, DGameShop supports other shitcoins and can combine amounts (e.g. half in Bitcoin, half in ARK).
@_date: 2019-05-20 11:44:00
In DGameMarket the amount is determined by the seller.
You are generally right, but the price in DG$ is fixed. You can top up your account with satoshi accuracy and spend the entire amount.
Lightning Network is a quite new and difficult solution. I try to create safe solutions, reliable as far as I can.
