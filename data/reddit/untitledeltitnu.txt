Not spreading FUD, not a fan of it either. I dont know exactly how much they are selling off but BTCUSD keeps going down hourly. I suspect they are selling off exchanges due to combined order books not looking too oversold. 
If anybody has exact amounts - please post here. Or call the fund manager at

Manchester is about the only bigish city. Used to live in Boston and head up there a lot, the whole states nice though. Further up north there a a lot of nice ski resorts and stuff and a lot of nice scenic drives. "Live free or Die"
*edit - Also as an added bonus they have no state income or sales taxes

So 7% Deutsche GDP is banking?

Its true, the selloff is due to GABI. They are an ETC in the UK market, basically a competitor to COIN and they are selling off, or deleveraging or whatever hedge funds do. Draw your own conclusions. 
Also this:   - doesnt necessarily mean the ETF is approved, just lowers the bar quite a bit.

ok then be honest and say you support BCH and cant stand anything derogatory yet true
@_date: 2017-08-23 14:50:53
wow, thats a lot of paid shills. Last gasp before segwit? Luckily the BCC crowd has the rage quit gene in their dna.

fuk it, im buying tulips online with bitcoin

Bcash is BCH - a rage quit alt coin currently mined by a cartel called bitmain in China that uses asicboost for 20% gains in mining.
See this:

Stop looking at the one minute chart, zoom out. Look at the 1 week chart only.
@_date: 2017-08-24 17:11:29
Bcash = BCH = Bitcoin Cash created Aug 1st Not sure whats wrong with that statement or whats with all the downvotes. Shill much?
@_date: 2017-08-24 17:27:24
So are we the grammer police here and you must use the proper term for this alt coin or else you get a series of vague posts wasting everybodies time? The problem with BCH isnt the slang terms used, its the development team making multiple mistakes in 24 days of live. Which is the point of this thread.

I was thinking of buying some land and doing a grown-up version of "Andrew Henrys Meadow" - Basically a community of treehouses, underground houses and geodesics. off grid, solar and hydro powered. A skatepark/sculpture area, sort of a cross between the Ride It Sculpture park in Detroit and the Indianapolis Art Museums 100 acres. Oh and a few hacked Tesla P90D's with Ludicrous mode permanently enabled, haha. Yeah that should do it.

You know with all the changes and updates to bitcoin, there really isnt any need for altcoins anymore.
@_date: 2018-03-20 18:24:54
I dont get this way of thinking. Its as if bitcoin wasnt evolving. Its code, there is a process in place called a BIP that allows it to constantly improve. Are you trolling to the uninformed sheeple perhaps?
@_date: 2017-09-28 17:50:28
Criticism from a miner, thats even better. Let me guess, youre against LN as well, because it takes away your profits?
@_date: 2017-09-28 15:56:22
@_date: 2017-09-28 15:27:41
There is a lot of what you just said that I disagree with but "Increasing the block size is entirely sustainable" really jumps out. 
Care to elaborate on your assertion? Maybe point out exactly how raising the hardware requirements on any code is good practice. That would be a good start. Do you have a mac or pc? Im assuming  not linux or any sort of embedded device. 
As far as your LN offchain comment: we either have LN or altcoins - you decide which is better. Furthermore if you dont like bitcoin stop using it. I dont know why people come here and bash it, i dont go to your altcoin forum and knock it down to make BTC look better.
@_date: 2017-09-28 14:37:22
Guys seriously, this post. Exactly what ive been meditating on for months and could not verbalize 110% true. All of it, with no spin, only the truth. Now decide which side youre on.
@_date: 2017-09-28 18:11:01
ad hominem, look it up. Last gasp of a losing argument.

If the banks excuse for a welfare handout is "were to big to fail" then they deserved to fail.

1. Because you would have incredible centralization due to hardware req's. Think of it this way: you know how ram requirements keep getting higher for software and certain proprietary operating systems? The real reason is so developers can write sloppy un-optimized code. Code that includes libraries it barely uses, with no multi threading or managing of cache memory at all. The Core devs realize this, and while a small increase due to user adoption may be in order an 8-32 times increase would be overkill and lazy. Yes Im calling BCH lazy. 
So the answer isnt black and white its more of a light grey color. But the truth usually lies somewhere in between.
2.) I agree with you
@_date: 2017-09-28 14:44:28
Actually it does. Higher hardware requirements to run a full node reduce the amounts of full nodes. If you suddenly cant run a full node on a RasberryPi it will reduce the number of people running them. If you dont understand this or dont know any of the terms without using google, you should not be commenting here.

Actually, Segwit - Not S2X - supplants altcoins.

Actually JPM makes most of its money from fees.
See: 
"But the bottom line is clear: For big banks like JPMorgan, at least, the business is less about lending and more about fees and trading profits."

If you look at the underlying technology:
bitcoin = the internet
So if you look at the usage of the technology, there really wasn't ever a bubble. The usage just increased, often exponentially.
ICO  = dot-com stocks
Both are spaces filled with scams and legitimate ideas to invest in if you believe in it.

alright fine, I will actually read the article
@_date: 2018-04-17 16:12:33
And furthermore, I would say it just withstood one of the biggest social attacks ever waged, with the segwit fork/BCH failed attempt to centralize by bad actors.
@_date: 2018-04-17 15:59:48
They dont, bitcoin is designed to be trustless. Or rather, they trust open source code and mathematical proofs of encryption more then they trust banks that are too big to jail and on corporate welfare. Please rename the title of the article, its extremely misleading. Good article about the Fed though.

Because Ethereum hardforked. Because the ether blockchain is mutable. Because Ether is supported by big banks that are the reason for Bitcoin in the first place and because people associated with ethereum's blockchain created the credit default swap and caused the  recession of 2008. Any other questions?
