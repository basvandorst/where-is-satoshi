I don't see why the exchanges that aren't supporting BCH couldn't just take the Bitcoin Cash that is rightfully yours, sell it for BTC and make themselves solvent again. Defrauding us to cover up their fraud lol

Yeah I still don't have my BTC and customer support was getting back to me promptly at first but has been unresponsive for the last 4 hours

Yeah because a hacker could enter their database and manipulate my transaction history while also adding fake "recent activity" in LTC and ETH wallets (which I never used) that supposedly occurred several months ago. The entire website would have to be compromised for that to happen, but thanks for the input, didn't know there were so many infosec experts on this website ready to help me out!

Wow that's a really wise thing to do lol, unfortunately for me I did not do that. And no I haven't started a thread about it on this sub yet, should I?

Yeah that's what I'm hoping but it's kind of crazy that it's not even there my Coinbase bitcoin wallet has a completely new address.

Because I lost the phone I needed to get into the account and it took a while to port my number, gotta love 2FA

Nope, my bank account info is all there

Just logged into my Coinbase account and all my BTC is gone. Transaction history is gone too (not possible to delete so probably not hacked) and there is "recent activity" in my LTC and ETH wallets on there from a few months ago even though I have never used them (but still no transaction history for those either). I think it's safe to say Coinbase is fucked and I better get my BTC back.

Bruh I had no phone for a month. Im a CS major and have been in crypto for about a year now, and I don't pretend to know everything but it's not my fault that I'm poor

Use a bitcoin ATM. This site keeps track of them and will show you if there is one near you:
