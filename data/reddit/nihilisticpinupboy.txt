Bcause we must let everybody know that bcash is not bitcoin. The b in bcash stands for bcash. 
@_date: 2018-05-22 10:37:59
What software?

Good job! Bitcoin gives us so much freedom!

his signature he [posted here]( [does not verify.]( 
He still has not proven that he is the owner of the address he posted that has 1 BTC on it. So you guys might be looking for nothing and are getting trolled. Or he made a mistake in the signature. 
@_date: 2018-05-20 08:40:33
Apparently, I did it wrong. 
Not my fault that core does not even support their own segwit.
Get your shit together Core. All your shit. Get it together. 
You guys suck! 
@_date: 2018-05-20 08:37:52
Core not supporting their own stuff claims another victim. 
So  I can't use Electrum to verify this stuff? Well that sucks. 
Get your shit together, core devs! All of your shit. Get it together. Put it in a backpack or something. 
@_date: 2018-05-20 08:03:25
Your proof that you own this address does not verify. 
@_date: 2018-05-20 21:45:20
And I am sorry but WHY THE FUCK is Electrum and Bitcoin-QT not compatible with segwit signatures? 
Is there any software I can use to verify this myself, other then to trust a website? 
@_date: 2018-05-20 21:42:08
What he posted was a signed message that  does not verify in Electrum. 
He still has not proven that he is the owner of the address with the 1 BTC on.

I will  give you some bitcoin cash.

Actually in his power point presentation Gilfoyle [wrote this.]( 
Which will only work with fees under a dollar cent, which are properties that Bitcoin-BTC only has when the blocks have enough free space. 
@_date: 2018-05-20 09:09:52
Yeah but you can't use bitcoin core software for it or electrum. It does not support segwit signature validation. Which totally boggles my mind. They have been pushing segwit on to everybody but they can't update their software so you can use it? 
@_date: 2018-05-20 07:50:31
[That does not verify.](

Which is why people that actually want to use Bitcoin for payments forked in to Bitcoin Cash, so there is a version of Bitcoin that remains working like how it was originally intended.

When I buy a pizza at the supermarket I would very much like instant payments, I don't think any store is  going to work with a payment system that is not instant. 
@_date: 2018-06-11 11:22:45
How does that work? 
steam &lt;-- fiat &lt;-- bitcoin &lt;-- LN &lt;-- Bitcoin
Like that? 
@_date: 2018-06-07 14:55:46
That only works for a business when the exchange rate is stable enough.  Having to change your prices twice a day is a lot of work. Having to worry about your received Bitcoin being worth 20% less the next day is no fun.
Also being responsible for your own security is also not something every small business can just do. Payment providers make a lot of sense right now. If Bitcoin keeps on growing and the exchange rate becomes some what stable they will be needed less and less. But right now they are essential to adoption.

[BTC and BCH have exactly the same decentralization.]( 
@_date: 2018-06-01 03:05:44
What is going to happen after another halving? The price will have to double for mining income to stay the same. Do miners make more in fees when there are more LN transactions? Otherwise why will miners still want to mine BTC when the generation reward goes in half every 4 years? Should fees not take over?

I think the green are bitcoin unlimited nodes.

Bitcoin is broken? 
@_date: 2018-03-28 02:19:58
Bitcoin-Yoda is a big troll, he likes wasting people their time by pranking them with useless advice. You are better of asking for advice in subreddits that are about Bitcoin adoption and not just about trading Bitcoin and the market price.

It's because Tether's printing press run out of inkt. Don't worry, they just send Mark Karpelès to get some more.

Commission them to work for you and pay them in Bitcoin. Hey somebody got to get this new economy going, it won't happen if we all just day trade and hodl. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 05:14:00
Why? A true hodler would never shapeshift his bitcoins. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 06:58:18
No, that is gaining profit from other people's missery.

Their waiting times can be very long. Sometimes up to two hours.
