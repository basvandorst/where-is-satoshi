Have a source for the partnership?
I haven't been able to find any statement from Visa's side, not to mention the card isn't found on the Visa website

Sad part is that they are naive enough to think it will have only a positive effect on them.

Just cause you don't know the source doesn't make it false.

It follows what the daily price should be to reach 1 mil by the end date. So according to the prediction we're supposed to be at 10k today.

If you hold 0.28 btc ~~you are part of the 1%~~ and you put it all in 1 btc address then that address will be part of the 1% of addresses which hold more than 0 btc.

I've been hearing this for at least a decade, but in the context of gold/silver. I honestly doubt fiat currencies will ever completely disappear.

Use coinbase pro, much lower fees.
Was actually free until a few months ago

Didn't realize we had electronics since we found gold, thought it was a recent thing.

It's actually more nuanced than that, a third party that was processing data for Coinbase was doing this. 
This information was revealed after they had already split with that party. What makes it kinda worse, is that all this came to light when Coinbase was put on blast for signing on another party which were basically hackers, who sold software to oppressive governments. Though they dropped this group as well. 
I'm not sure if they have since filled the positions or if they are still looking for other replacements.

Most of these are automated. I remember getting copyright claims on YouTube when uploading certain content which didn't actually have copyright. At first I'd actually state reasons disagreeing with the claim, but noticed it was getting approved way to fast. So one day I used "poop" as my reason for fighting the copyright claim, and got approved just as fast. Since then I would just write poop for the claims, saved me quite a bit of time.

Thank you for responding, we have reviewed your comment, and after carefully consideration of you valid points have decided to approve the message.

I'm actually somewhat concerned about this event. There are so many ppl who have no clue what private/public keys are and want to participate in this blindly.
I've seen ppl ask how to get their exchange to send them their proof of keys.
It's a noble idea, but I think a lot of ppl are gonna get burned tomorrow and it won't be because of the exchanges.

Seems a few people have forgotten the June 15k prediction
@_date: 2019-09-24 12:42:48
Look closer, cause it did happen. 
Adjust the timeframe, you'll see it drops from 106EH to 66EH in the span of a day. That's about 40%, that is a significant drop no doubt.

The crash really hit him hard
@_date: 2018-04-28 10:48:58
It could help a little bit. But nothing really prepares you for seeing your investment vanish before your eyes.
When you have real money in the game you start seeing things differently and your emotions can take over leading you to make regrettable trades. I'd say just jump in with a **small** position.
@_date: 2019-05-08 11:19:42
So is it like CFDs? Cause  it's  obvious you won't  actually  own anything

Not really, it's just not open source. 
Just like bnb, hashgraph, hyperleger

If it causes Bitcoin to go down, it will have a similar effect on the entire world financial infrastructure. So I wouldn't be worried about Bitcoin specifically.
