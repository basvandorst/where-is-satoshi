So what? It's a completely meaningless comparison. Bitcoin, again, is not a company. If you want to compare its market cap to something you should be comparing it to [the market cap of gold or US dollars](

What the heck are you talking about? Please do link us to more information about these amazing technology adoption prediction tools you're referring to and how they've been used to show that widespread adoption of bitcoin-like technology is inevitable. (Also, information on how the big impact of computers/internet/mobile phones were "easy predictions" in their day - and not just seemingly easy predictions in hindsight - would be greatly appreciated.)

Find me one person who bought BTC a couple years ago that won't wish they had sold at 1200 if it crashes down to nothing again at some point. The fact that some people were lucky enough to get some ridiculous short-term gains really isn't meaningful here. The point is that whatever's going to happen with Bitcoin is still wildly speculative, and most of what people have bought into this point, most of what the current price of Bitcoin represents, is all based on that speculation. Some of you gambled and got lucky, great. That doesn't mean squat in terms of how good or bad an idea cryptocurrency is, how good or bad Bitcoin as an implementation of that idea is, or how likely or unlikely widespread adoption of it is at any point.

I get it fine. I understand how you see it. I'm challenging you to open your mind a bit and consider that maybe, just maybe, what you think is a cold, hard fact is actually just one particular way of looking at things, and one that isn't logically consistent to boot.
You think a society doesn't have a "brain" because it's just a bunch of separate beings making decisions. But each one of those being's brains is, itself, just a bunch of separate beings making decisions. So which is it? Can a bunch of different beings making decisions together be considered a larger being, or can't it? With the group of cells you say "yes," but with the group of humans you say, "no." Why? It's not "monolith," it's not "shared consciousness," and it definitely has nothing to do with Santa, we already covered all of those.
Think about it. Try to explain it to yourself, in an honest manner, one that's evaluating each "group" by the same, logically consistent criteria. You'll either do that, or you won't. If you do, I think you'll find that there's really no difference there at all, other than our subjective decision to see it a certain way.

Can't speak for him directly, but there does seem to be a correlation in my experience between an excessive volume of hype surrounding something, and said thing falling way short of the expectations that hype inspired.

You know what? You're right. Strawman arguments that are similar to the arguments people are actually making in some ways are similar in all ways. Saying that societies exist is the same as saying they're exactly like individuals in every way imaginable.

Of course individual cells make decisions. Stuff goes into a cell, gets processed, and comes out. That's all a decision is at any level - the result of processing inputs. Same with groups of humans - they process information collectively and make decisions via voting/etc. all the time.

You're trying to suggest that anything I perceive as a group "act" is really just a complex combination of individuals acting. By that same reasoning, I can say to you that anything you perceive as an individual "act" is just a complex combination of cells acting. It's really not that hard to understand, you're right.
There is no special "monolith" status an individual has that a group or society does not. Webster's defines [monolith]( as "an organized whole that acts as a single unified powerful or influential force." Groups often behave in this manner, as do individuals. Other times, groups are scattered and rife with internal conflicts, as are individuals at times. The only difference is your willingness to see it.

Right, but you haven't demonstrated why an individual IS a real thing and a society IS NOT one.

It's up almost 100 pts (20%) the last couple days. Too early to read too much into it, though. In my opinion, it's probably just a temporary bump from bullish investors reacting to it hitting the symbolic "floor" of 400, and jumping in to take advantage of the "bargain" price. Same thing happened when it hit ~~500 in February and~~ 600 in December.
*Edit: Actually, I guess it only got down to 535 in February before the small bump, so scratch that part.

From [Wikipedia](
"An entity is something that exists in itself, actually or hypothetically. It need not be of material existence. In particular, abstractions and legal fictions are usually regarded as entities. In general, there is also no presumption that an entity is animate."

Show me where the overall risk reduction is that's significant enough to make consumers want to switch. I'm aware there are protections, but I don't see how there's less risk overall; just different risk. And that's not likely to make most people want to use it.


That's still exchange, it's just automated. And where does it work? Internationally? Does it convert BTC to whatever the local currency is? If so, okay, kinda cool, maybe that's a service that would draw people in if there's no similar service that does that for fiat, but it's still not a concept that depends on Bitcoin to work. So there's still nothing about BTC itself that people have an incentive to adopt it for.


For the record, this is an unproductive thing to say that doesn't really ever support an argument. You're really just saying "I don't know how to explain this to you" while implying that the reason for that is other person is dumb. Have more respect than that and be willing to risk the possibility that you may be the person who doesn't get it, that you maybe haven't thought it through as much as you'd thought and that's why you're having trouble convincing the other person. I'll admit I might be the one, but I'm willing to consider it and talk it out, listen to what you have to say, and provide responses for your consideration instead of just shutting you down with a "you don't get it." So grant me the same respect.


It's my understanding that the customer never has to pay fees with PayPal (I'm looking at the app right now, and it says right on the screen "No fee for you. The seller pays the fee.") So, you're right, businesses certainly have an incentive to switch, but we're talking about whether consumers have a similar incentive. Maybe you know something about unusual cases where consumers have to pay fees to PayPal that I don't. Are you saying this is the case? If not, I don't see that this would be a reason consumers would want to switch.

But less protection against initial billings that turn out to be fraudulent. Duplicate charges are pretty trivial to deal with in most cases. Sure, there are ways you could set up 3rd-party services that offer other forms of fraud protection - but at the end of the day, even in the best-case scenario for bitcoin you're just trading one form of occasional inconvenience for another, which doesn't translate to much incentive to switch.


I can only spend it in the geographically decentralized "country" known as the community of people who accept Bitcoin, which, while widespread, is still pretty small. Anywhere outside of that, I have to exchange to/from some other currency, and its instability makes that very unappealing. So, again, not much incentive to switch there.


There's nothing about this type of system that requires bitcoin. I already use venmo to swap cash with my friends free of charge, and lots of businesses are starting to take paypal, etc. and cover the fee. I don't see much reason to deal with exchanging to/from a highly volatile asset to gain these benefits when I have other options available.

Laws don't have to shut something down completely to control it / relegate it to a certain role. Currency doesn't have much value without widespread usage, and most people aren't going to want to use it if it's not legal tender. You and I may be able to use WoW gold for any transaction we like w/o any government's approval, but I sure as hell don't want my salary paid in it. The incentives/advantages for using cryptocurrency illegally just aren't there for most people, unless they're using it to facilitate other activities that are illegal anyway.
@_date: 2014-09-06 00:23:18
Mmm, but what about shocks? A truly fixed money supply may fix the monetary shocks the gold standard experienced, but technology shocks, supply and demand shocks, etc. still lead to booms and busts, and that was a big part of the problems we faced under that system. Central regulation and inflationary policies have helped ease the effects of booms and busts considerably. It's not that other problems haven't been introduced, but it's arguable that overall things have been a lot more economically stable in the past 80 years than they had been prior to that.

I'm curious as to what possible event exists that you guys would interpret as a bad sign for bitcoin.
"Massively unprecedented solar flare creates massive havoc in the Earth's magnetic field, rendering all electrically-powered devices on the planet completely inoperable. Worldwide chaos ensues."
"This is actually good for Bitcoin! Disruption of the existing statist power structure clears the path for the rise of a superior decentralized platform of government and finance! Free from the shackles of debilitating regulation, we can create an even more robust underlying technology that doesn't rely on corrupt centralized power grids and their unreliable electricity! I can't wait until the canned goods I'm investing into the Bitcoin developers' fallout bunkers grows 1,000,000x in value!"

No, I mean Tier 2, the address verification tier, the one that lets you use non-virtual currency and bumps the limits to $2000 daily/$10000 monthly. Here's what I see on the verification screen, hasn't changed since yesterday:

@_date: 2013-12-05 16:51:01
I'm still in "processing" as of today. I sent their support an email and got an automated reply saying their verifications were really backed up and any verification tier could take up to a week to process. I ended up going to coinbase - it took them 3 days for their bank account verification to go through, but still faster than this.
