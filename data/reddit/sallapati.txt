All major exchanges have KYC policy, you send your id to almost all of them.


Not neccesarily, all big miners are companies now (thanks to asic), It takes 3 big goverments for agree to regulate bitcoin to find and force them to reject some transactions.


Miners rule bitcoin, who are greedy by nature, I don't think they care about govs, anonymity, they just care about profits.


Yes, i was talking about bitcoin of course cryptocurrencies like monero bulletproof when it comes to anonymity.

Well I am. :) I’ll buy cheaper. Like from 1k$

The reason bitcoin price is rising because some big companies and rich people manipulating the price all the time.
Almost all of you using banks and exchanges to buy and sell it, every coin trackable in blockchain, mining is almost centralised thanks to asic. 
So how do you guarantee that some day governments won’t pay or force miners to don’t confirm some transactions?
Bitcoin is fungible, trackable and controlled by some people (early investors) and companies (bitmain).
When they get bored or threatened by governments, they’ll be first ones to escape from the ship.
Everyone who bought it for selling it higher price will lose their money.
Bitcoin should address and solve these problems created by its controllers.

Not necessarily, some sellers doesn’t require a id, still PayPal transactions reversible so anyone would need an id of the buyer.

Govs don’t care about bitcoin right now, when they do they can simply threat centralised mining companies to reject some transactions etc. Also you all using banks &amp; exchanges to but crypto. lol I can’t even imagine the price when they take action, bitcoin to magma will be your new motto.

You can find a lot of good deals in LocalBitcoins. Just don’t forget to check reputation of seller.

Hmm, hope i get it correctly, well in Trezor you own your wallet’s seed and the result of that seed (your private key), In web wallets like blockchain they create your private key for you and even they tell you that key, you have to trust them with it. So they are not same level since Blockchain is just a company and can go disappear or hacked like Mt. Gox.

they don’t have replay protection because they intended to take over network and become bitcoin. it’s not a hard fork like bcc or btg, it’s like a %51 attack on network.

Seems like a trolling attempt, but a whois record would be nice.

Paribu, BTCTurk, Koineks, Koinim, Localbitcoins, Cex.io.

Those words called seed which is for creating your private key. You need to use your private key for each transaction.
Trezor just keeps it on device and your coins would be secure even using it on a hacked computer.
If you trust your computer for not being hacked you can use a software wallet which is more practical.
f.i i’m using electrum wallet in a hardened
linux and never had any problem.

Someone is spamming the pool with low-value transactions, and whoever he/she is losing a lot of money.

Oh that’s clever.
