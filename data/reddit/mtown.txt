It's going to crash hard. The whole Bitcoin community is full of speculators and pro-Bitcoin articles which borderline propaganda. nobody asks the fundamental questions which determine if Bitcoin will be a success. is it actually catching on with people and the mainstream?
Other than dark market nets. Probably not. I just see a lot of yapping from small-time speculators within the community. I think most regular people find it strange and hard to comprehend. And larger investors from the price hike have exited or are planning an exit soon. 
The price dropping 16% in one day just shows how volatile this investment is. People are ready to sell on the drop of a hat because they know deep down its over-priced. I could go on, but my bet is the price will drop big time soon.

Pretty wishy-washy article. Sounds like more btc propaganda

A Bitcoin bubble is going to pop IMO. Too many speculators. Too much Bitcoin propaganda. They scare away real users who want to use the currency for its intrinsic value. They say chinese runaway millionaires will invest, but i doubt they'll put their money in a unstable currency like btc.

No they were bought by someone with dollar signs in their eyes.

I would buy the shit out of the currency but i honestly think its current value is a little over-valued and a risky investment. Hoping for a crash to buy in
