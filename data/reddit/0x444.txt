I have not seen that behaviour. I can still obtain identifiers using aliases. There is no change.

It's totally useless. The original person can also download your wallet with no issue. It is notifying you that someone has your wallet for an offine attack. That's it. 
@_date: 2013-04-24 12:46:26
I was under the impression that you still needed to pass more identification than that to the yubico auth API. It's entirely possible that I have recalled this one incorrectly. 
@_date: 2013-04-25 00:38:56
They didn't respond to me, or anyone else, I wouldn't worry. 
@_date: 2013-04-25 00:36:41
Most people use an alias that they also use on mtgox/bitcointalk/reddit. It's easy. 
@_date: 2013-04-25 00:37:07
That's correct. Visiting the page gives you access to the encrypted blob. 
@_date: 2013-04-25 00:40:47
Dumping the usernames from the mt gox leak and from reddit would be a good start. Most people use the same username for anything. 
@_date: 2013-04-24 12:28:48
Don't use an online wallet. Especially not Blockchain.info or Strongcoin. 
@_date: 2013-04-25 00:32:04
This does absolutely nothing. If someone already has your wallet blob to crack offline, why does changing the alias help? They already have your private keys. 
@_date: 2013-04-24 13:06:23
Yes. It's also a very very fast algo (not what you want here). You might have seen miners mention that they can process 500Mh/s. That's 500,000,000 SHA256 attempts every second. 
@_date: 2013-04-25 00:38:47
Typo on my part. 
@_date: 2013-04-25 00:31:33
Yes, most Blockchain wallets have probably been downloaded at this point. 
@_date: 2013-04-25 04:48:10
The behaviour has changed again since it was mentioned. It was possible, and most wallet identifiers have probably been downloaded. 
If the user has no email address set, a download is still possible. Here the wallet for 'dooglus':

Your password doesn't matter. Once osmeone knows your wallet address it can be attacked offline, with GPUs, at billions attempts a second. 
@_date: 2013-04-24 12:24:16
Very much so. 
@_date: 2013-04-24 12:58:54
That's only the case if the user enables it (they probably wont). The second layer of encryption can be bruteforced even more easily than the first one. As they are layered, you can positivly crack the first one, verify that the contents are worth stealing using the public keys, and then crack the internal layer if it is worth it. 
@_date: 2013-04-25 00:38:23
Blockchain.info and CLoudFlare can see perfectly well what you addresses you own. When you log in the app makes several requests for the balance of wallets. It's easy enough for them to work out who owns what.
@_date: 2013-04-24 12:28:18
A few posts above somebody lost 170BTC ($25500 USD) from Blockchain.info. There's even bigger amounts in other wallets too. You can find them by looking for TX relayed by "0.0.0.0" in their blockchain browser. With overwhelming probability, they are from the wallet service. 
@_date: 2013-04-24 12:57:28
Hence my confusion. I've only ever seen them used where the secret has to be set up, and I don't own one of the things myself. 
@_date: 2013-04-24 12:33:58
That was one of my points too. It's also stored unencrypted in iPhone backups, where it is reachable by Mac malware. 
@_date: 2013-04-24 12:26:13
Blockchain.info has had no direct compromise that has been made public. The attack I describe (download and dictionary attack offline) is very possible and has been used though. 
@_date: 2013-04-24 12:48:00
Not the mobile app storing passwords in plain text, no. The download-the-wallet-and-attack-with-a-gpu-for-profit is nasty though.
@_date: 2013-04-26 08:27:59
Someone already has a copy of your private keys. Changing your password and alias will do absolutely nothing. 
@_date: 2013-04-25 00:37:37
Most passwords aren't random, and attacks can be faster than that. Bear in mind that some miners have 100+ AMD GPUs. 
@_date: 2013-04-24 13:15:25
Knowing the public key lets you check if the wallet has any value, and see if it is worthwhile attacking the second pasphrase. If it doesn't have a second passohrase, the coins are yours to spend. 
The second password would be about the same speed to crack as the second one, possibly even slightly faster. 
People choose dumb passwords all the time. Offline attacks are easy. If you think your password is immune it probably isn't. 
@_date: 2013-04-25 00:34:11
Your 10 digit password will be cracked offline almost instantly. I'd be moving your funds out quick smart. 
@_date: 2013-04-25 00:39:48
It uses some crazy whitening on mouse movements. I wouldn't trust it with anything. 
@_date: 2013-04-25 04:46:49
Yes they are. Read the other posts in this thread. If I know your alias, I can download your encrypted blob. 
@_date: 2013-04-25 05:08:51
I assume so. Here's your wallet blob.
