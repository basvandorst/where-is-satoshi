Who is the guy from Overstock? Is that the CEO??
Edit: He mentioned Patrick Byrne so it's not the CEO.

Sometimes you just have to really trust someone to do the right thing. You know?

Lawsky asks about tumblers/mixers.
Felten: It's a reaction to the public ledger and people have many reasons for wanting to maintain financial privacy. 
Athey: If you have an exchange with a US bank account, that exchange will be forced by the bank to monitor identity. It may be possible to develop an address book for identity mapping to addresses but people would leave that system at some point but knowing the dollar amounts is good digital trail for LE to start with. Best to try and follow large sums rather than all transactions.

The point to get involved now is to invest. Investment means building liquidity and drive development to Bitcoin more convenient. Most of us who are familiar with a certain pace of growth and development would have to be impressed with just how fast Bitcoin is progressing on all fronts.

Professor Felten answered a question pretty well about defending against 51% attacks. He notes that market activity would be detectable on trying to manufacture or purchase that much mining power. Ignoring blocks also an option.
@_date: 2014-01-29 17:23:43
He also said that they screen 14% of orders in order to catch the 2% so that 14% number can come down if a higher proportion of transactions are done with Bitcoin.

i just don't see the elitism frankly. People say that a lot but they rarely post examples. Please post some though because that would be genuinely helpful.

Seeing your income 10x or 20x might make you rather enjoy any inconvenience in converting it back to fiat when necessary. Not guaranteeing anything but it's worked out well for the vast majority of people who chose to get paid in cryptocurrency in the past.

Dogecoin is a publicity stunt with a 1-2 year duration. It will probably help to break the ice for some users to get into cryptocurrency but when the mining reward drops to 10k/block, the hashrate of the coin is going be very weak and easy for even smaller pools to 51%. So I would say, support it if you want to feed the excitement but be sure you know your exit point or if instead you'd prefer to just donate some to the marketing department.

Next tell them how much bad luck you've since had with your cryptoinvestments and hopefully they won't hit you up for cash.
@_date: 2014-02-04 03:02:37
Those massive GPU farms already exist and are running for Litecoin and the other billion scrypt coins. Just wait until Dogecoin has each of its halvings (all happening before the first Litecoin one) and has a 50x lower mining reward rate. Better prepare a plot in the dogecemetary.

Hyper-asset-bubble. Cartels. Hoarding! This guy must be fun at parties.
Edit: I think this guy actually understands the threat that Bitcoin poses for central banks and he plans to come with the thunder.

It's pretty clear. People who sold a lot in 2013 but didn't expect to pay capital gains taxes didn't save enough to pay and are now liquidating in order to pay the IRS. If this is true, we should see a bottom at April 15th minus the average time to get money from exchanges to bank accounts.

Didn't see a thread for this panel yet, so created it. The panel has been going for 15 mins already.
Professor Anthey mentioned Ripple further expanding the discussion of just what they might be talking about.
The second speaker Ed W. Felten talked alot about the multiple forms of consensus that give the Bitcoin system strength.
@_date: 2014-04-30 07:26:59
And of these 65%, just how many were also based on a fad?
/if bitcoin is a fad, i'm calling the CEO of the Internet to request he fax me a fad status update report
@_date: 2014-02-04 03:57:25
Also worth pointing out that there are many legitimate businesses and a significant fraction of individuals who will want some forms of privacy enhancements with their cryptocurrency. Coinjoin, stealth addresses...these will be developed and refined so regular people can use them. I can even imagine some Bitcoin "banks" (wallets) touting their financial privacy technologies as impotant features.
@_date: 2014-01-29 20:05:14
Professor Athey brings up velocity of money, alternative currency systems, and regulation in regards to the price of a coin.

Even without replay or trying to get a usable ECG signal, if the past is any indicator, this device is likely to have about 47 ways to hack it through usb/bluetooth/whatever else they've implemented for comms.

She just called wires and ACH obsolete. I forgive her for mentioning Ripple a few times.

That's it, they said it. Money launderers are vital to this banking system. We need clearly need a new one.

Allaire just mentioned the Fed and other central banks for the first time in these hearings.
@_date: 2014-02-04 04:00:36
OP said proportionally.
@_date: 2014-01-29 16:42:06
Give them time. I'm sure they're being made aware of gaps in their understanding in these hearings and hopefully they'll be motivated to fill in those gaps in the coming days and certainly before they start to support specific legislation.

Can we get his testimony bitcrushed?
@_date: 2014-02-04 03:24:44
It's based on it but there's also a luck component since each hash is like a roll of the digital dice.
@_date: 2014-02-04 03:22:30
As far as I can tell, a doge meme and to some extent tipping, reddit and the idea of  decentralized digital currency.
@_date: 2014-02-04 03:16:41
Might be the multipools or could just be a string of good luck.
@_date: 2014-02-13 16:37:04
Bitcoin is a protocol; its users are perhaps the most decentralized group with a common interest ever in existence. Companies and organizations can show the kind of courtesy and discipline you are suggesting but other users will continue to share any information they can get about Bitcoin. In addition, many of these other users would consider last the feelings of a bank's PR department.
@_date: 2014-01-29 20:20:20
The fed guy mentions GHash.io and how close they got to 51%. Then Lawsky asks what did that do to the price. The answer, volatility continued with 20-30% moves by the day.
@_date: 2014-02-04 03:09:47
It was because of the announcement that there's no cap on the currency. It's also likely that the hashrate will fall and consolidate more into Litecoin with each halving of the dogecoin mining reward.
@_date: 2014-01-29 22:38:45
9000% lol. I wonder who gave him that figure anyway or how he arrived at it exactly.

Great initiative. Please post a donation address for those who are not setup for tipping.

He also said they would entertain accepting other cryptocurrencies though obviously Coinbase or Bitpay would have to be onboard there.
