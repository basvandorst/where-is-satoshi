Exactly. There is no explanation for it, other than the obvious.
When this pops you'll be able to hear the 'pop' from San Fran to Mt Fuji.
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:56:21
I don't know why I find this so funny. Genuinely lolling here.
@_date: 2018-01-26 23:29:44


Um... what?
@_date: 2018-01-21 00:43:13


Especially when the Tether Problem is being discussed by regular people who are not even in the crypto sphere (see [this recent podcast]( which spends a solid 15 minutes discussing it in detail).
If nothing else, the rising awareness of the Tether Problem is certain to dissuade potential adopters ('investors') from entering the crypto space ('market').
This is very important and deserves more attention. Good to see a thread on the main page of this sub discussing it.
@_date: 2018-01-31 02:00:29


I thought I was the only one.
@_date: 2018-01-26 14:06:35
Thanks but that does not answer my question.
@_date: 2018-01-31 23:57:05


Not to be 'that guy' but have you ever wondered where these incredible world population numbers come from?
@_date: 2018-01-31 23:57:22
That is a relief.
@_date: 2018-01-26 23:25:25


Yep. If things keep going the way they are going, we might soon have to rename this sub r/sunkcost
@_date: 2018-01-26 23:27:05
So it could drop *another* 80% on it current price (already down 50% from its ATH) before you would be given some pause? 
Faith is the only way I can describe this.
@_date: 2018-01-31 23:51:22
Pretty much this.
@_date: 2018-01-31 23:48:46
And nobody saw it coming!
@_date: 2018-01-26 13:57:19
Do you believe **anybody** who sells is a 'weak hand'?
@_date: 2018-01-22 23:20:20
I see. Thank you for clarifying.
@_date: 2018-01-31 02:01:40
What kind of a moron would be doing that right now?
@_date: 2018-01-21 03:00:13
Well thanks again, your effort is much appreciated.
Can I ask you, do you believe the Tether Problem will blow up? If so, how long do you think is the 'upper limit' (i.e. the longest it could reasonably go) before it all collapses?
650 million in a week is absolutely ridiculous.
@_date: 2018-01-21 00:55:29


This is good advice, but how many people have been trained in critical thinking?
It is an [admitted fact]( that secondary schooling was designed to produce like-minded 'producers and workers' rather than *thinkers*.
@_date: 2018-01-22 06:13:07
Do you really believe 'history' from 200+ years ago, though?
@_date: 2018-01-31 01:55:48


Tether printing billions of fake dollars?
@_date: 2018-01-26 23:29:23


Since when?
@_date: 2018-01-31 23:47:27
Except the people who made bets with colleagues that 'it will never reach five figures bro'.
@_date: 2018-01-21 00:55:46
Who controls that?
@_date: 2018-01-21 00:47:42
Thank you very much for this. That chart tells the tale.
How much time did it take you to put together the table/chart?
@_date: 2018-01-22 04:19:36
There is no hate here. In fact I personally believe there is a place for secret societies in the modern world, given how easily upset the average person is when presented with simple observations about reality.
Again, the issue with the Satoshi Roundtable being run by a freemason is **what this implies** about cryptocurrency, especially wrt whether or not it is in 'opposition' to the establishment.
@_date: 2018-01-22 04:03:43
Can you give some examples or sources?
@_date: 2018-01-31 23:56:17


Why not 200 trillion? Why is that not 'feasible'?
@_date: 2018-01-31 23:54:08
Remember the people who claimed they would buy up bitcoin if it ever got back down below 10k?
What ever happened to those people?
@_date: 2018-01-26 23:53:32
Less than two weeks. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 03:38:13
It used to be that bitcoin promoters claimed that they believed in bitcoin/cryptocurrency because it was 'against the establishment'.
Point out that some of the biggest names in the crypto game are clearly part of the establishment, and the response is cheap sarcasm.
Funny world, sometimes.
@_date: 2018-01-21 00:56:37
Brought a smile to my face.
@_date: 2018-01-27 01:33:36


If you want to look at it this way.
The other way to look at it is that (at 2k/btc) you are down 90% from the ATH.
It is amazing how humans can choose to look at things one way or another, and generally stick to that way of looking at it no matter how bad things get for them.
@_date: 2018-01-31 23:55:39


So good that 99% of bitcoiners don't even host the ledger on their own computer.
@_date: 2018-01-31 02:01:23
The old 'watch what the right hand is doing' trick. I like it.
@_date: 2018-01-26 23:24:40
Six months, hey? On what do you base that belief?
@_date: 2018-01-21 00:53:21
Now that is a little suspicious. Why do you think they are doing this?
@_date: 2018-01-21 00:47:04
Excellent post. BCC is nothing compared to Tether, and it is no coincidence that the Tether printing presses have been running red hot since BCC collapsed.
@_date: 2018-01-26 23:27:39


So much truth in this, sadly.
@_date: 2018-01-31 23:51:08
You mean because of its military connections?
Or that it 'played ping pong' in China?
@_date: 2018-01-26 23:28:25
Thanks for the answer. That is an interesting perspective.
@_date: 2018-01-31 23:54:43
A guarantee with 100% certainty? Seems tautological.
@_date: 2018-01-31 23:46:54
No, but I *would* have, if I weren't so busy [spreading fud](
@_date: 2018-01-21 00:56:08


I am pleasantly surprised to see this at the top of the thread. Good work.
@_date: 2018-01-22 03:39:48
As discussed in the podcast, the issue here is to do with whether or not crpytocurrency is truly in *opposition* to the existing system, or if it is merely the next evolution of the very same system it is supposed to replace/oppose.
@_date: 2018-01-25 01:00:15


The last bear market was three years long. Who wants to be part of that cycle?
@_date: 2018-01-31 23:48:22
Some of the best weeks of my life. I'll always have the memories.
@_date: 2018-01-31 23:47:59
Where did you receive your education in economics, friend?
@_date: 2018-01-26 13:56:35
Can I ask you an honest question?
How much further would bitcoin have to drop before you would reconsider your current belief that this is simply a temporary 'dip'?
@_date: 2018-01-25 00:57:01
So you lost 10% of your total savings, and you want this sub to affirm your decision?
@_date: 2018-01-21 00:44:55
And **why** do they earn so much money on trading fees? Because of the price of bitcoin. And what is pushing up the price of bitcoin?
(This isn't difficult, folks)
@_date: 2018-01-31 23:52:20
3 years ago it was some other figure. Let that sink in.
@_date: 2018-01-21 02:58:56
Is there an official explanation/policy on reddit concerning this?
@_date: 2018-01-21 00:53:43
Especially 12 months ago.
@_date: 2018-01-31 23:50:21
Not to mention the one who got cucked by a crack-whore.
@_date: 2018-01-27 00:36:11
Fair enough. Let's see where it goes from here.
@_date: 2018-01-22 01:13:54
About 50 minutes into the interview, it is claimed that the annual 'Satoshi Roundtable' is organized by Bruce Fenton, and that Mr Fenton is an admitted Freemason. If this is true, does it fly in the face of the notion that cryptocurrency is 'anti establishment'?
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:57:23
If people ever begin looking into the expenditure history of these 'not for profits' it might soon be.
How would you like to find out that a certain 'not for profit' has paid its founder 70% of total revenues in a financial year?
A 'not for profit' which has been handed a huge sum of money by the 'Pineapple Fund'.
Would you like to see *that* on the nightly news?
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:03:36
What percentage of BCH supporters base their opinions on philosophical/technical grounds, and what percentage base their opinions on vested financial interest?
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:58:33
Don't forget that Tether also [just issued]( another cool 50,000,000 USDT.
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:15:41
I think we ought to ask that question of BTC, BCH, LTC, ETH, the list goes on.
Anybody can claim philosophical justifications for their preferred coin. 
Reality is that they simply push the barrow of the coin(s) they hold themselves.
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:24:34


Incorrect. I sold most of my Bcash holdings recently, which I now regret somewhat because the price has gone up a fair bit since I sold.
Why did I sell? The main reason is that I noticed how culty the r/btc sub seemed to be getting. A few days ago I got downvoted for simply pointing out that some random online exchange in the Phillipines 'considering' adding Bcash to their exchange is **not** front page worthy.
In other words your ad hominem is entirely untrue. I am definitely not 'pro-Bcash' or 'anti-BTC'. Why would you instantly attack me as such, without any evidence?
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:45:31
Yep. All cryptos will be hard hit when - not if - this house of cards comes crashing down.
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:29:13
Has anybody looked into the financials of the 'not for profits' which are being given these donations from Pineapple Fund?
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:54:46
It will be largely dependent on how much Tether they print, will it not?
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:26:31
'We issue these Tethers and peg them to the **American** dollar (by the way, we aren't able to redeem the Tethers for dollars for our **American** customers).'
These guys should do standup.
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:07:16
yeah but satoshi
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:05:30


Surely most us have as our  principle that we want to see our investments rise in value. Everything else is window dressing and post-facto rationalization. Let's be honest.
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:46:37
Most people will turn a blind eye if they know deep down their own 'profits' are helped by the ruse.
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:28:44


You mean because it is the one which some people see as a threat to the value of their own preferred coin?
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:01:21
Can you elaborate on this? How did you arrive at your conclusion? And do you have a vested interest in BTC vs BCH?
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:59:37


Like saying that a pre-schooler is not ready to drive a flying car.
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:57:06
What is wrong with so-called 'conspiracy theories'?
If iFinex owning *both Bitfinex and Tether*, and the *skyrocketing issuance of Tether*, is not evidence of a conspiracy, then you might as well tell me you still believe in the moon landings.
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:55:07


Quite right. I enjoy reading this sub (and other crypto subs) and this is partly because of the extreme opinions which keep the place lively. I say let people be overly bearish or overly bullish, it all adds to the rich tapestry.
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:08:37
This is what makes me sad. I sold most of my BCH mostly because of how cultish that sub was, made me suspect the real brains trust was here on r/bitcoin
Don't I look like an idiot now...
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:44:10


I suspect it may have something to do with how humans generally prioritize money over principles. People can **claim** to hold the most pure values and motivations, but watch what they actually **do** when money is involved.
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:53:59
The entire cryptocurrency scene is like one gigantic soap opera.
I am endlessly entertained every day.
And lately my net worth has also been going up every day (at least on paper).
Good times.
@_date: 2017-12-29 07:48:06
Are you listening to yourself?
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:22:30
If you understand arbitrage then you will understand why the Tethers have a flow-on effect throughout the entire cryptocoin economy.
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:24:01
What comment? Rather than address the points raised in the OP he resorted to attacking the messenger. And since then **another** $55,000,000 Tethers have been issued. This is a mad house.
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:25:00
The [statistical correlation]( between Tethers on issue and bitcoin price this year is breathtaking.
Oh but the BTC price rise is all due to 'institutional investors' though. lol
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:08:43
"Sadly, however, we cannot create or redeem tether for any U.S.-based customers at this time."
There it is, **in black and white**, folks.
And keep in mind that they [printed another 50,000,000]( less than 24 hours ago.
When will the madness end?
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:55:56
Is there an easy way to do it without an exchange? For those who only have the public and private key, no QR code.
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:52:07
Good on you for this initiative. Bear in mind that it was the Paradise Papers which helped to reveal that iFinex controls both Bitfinex and Tether i.e. the [Tether Problem]( which is at the heart of the current cryptocurrency price spike.
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:25:07


Apology accepted, and as I explained earlier, I have since sold most of those holdings, largely because of the cult-like atmosphere on their sub. When people attack me on this sub simply for raising the Tether issue it seems like this place is no better.
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:53:52


Well said. Who is game enough to leave their money in the crypto market until the last minute?
When the music stops there will be no chairs left and many backsides will hit the floor.

What do you mean? How are you advancing anything if you are holding rather than using as currency?
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:06:54
Do you think the latest batch of newly-minted Tethers will be a factor?
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:22:51


Then how do you feel about the [Tetheral Reserve](
Does it bother you that your gains my be directly tied to the issuance of money in Federal Reserve style?
Tether have printed another 100,000,000 USDT in the last 24 hours.
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:28:08


But what if they are really trustworthy and can convince lots of mums and dads and old folk to invest and hodl?
@_date: 2017-12-29 07:47:56
I do not personally believe the Pineapple Fund has been 'misused'.
Until certain questions are answered, however, some people may become suspicious -- *especially* when details come to light of the questionable expenditure record of certain 'not for profits' which have received substantial donations from the Pineapple Fund.
Rest assured that I have contacted the 'not for profit'(s) in question and the Pineapple Fund directly for comment. As time of writing, none of the parties concerned have answered my simple questions. Naturally I find this conspicuous in and of itself.
Watch this space.
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:58:52


The fact that you even need to point this out shows just how financially illiterate so many bitcoin n00bs really are.
muh 'market cap' and muh 'trading volume'. I feel sorry for these people.
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:11:32
damn if the sky will fall then i had better sell my BCH and convert to BTC right now and then hodl BTC to the moon amirite?
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:44:59

@_date: 2018-02-01 14:02:56
You mean seven weeks ago?
@_date: 2018-02-06 04:02:42
This appears to be the correct answer.
@_date: 2018-02-01 02:20:41
On the contrary, I believe we should have faith in whatever we are told is the world population, even when it jumps from 6 billion to 7 billion in the space of one generation.
As if our authorities would lie about something like this!

I honestly don't know who any of those four options are.
So I voted for Hillary.
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:04:59
But if they don't convince others to hodl, then their own investments might suffer.
Is that what you want? People to stop convincing others to sink with them?
@_date: 2018-02-01 01:00:22
Let's start with Tether.
@_date: 2018-02-01 13:52:50
I could not agree with you more. You are 100% correct.
As my mate Percy used to say: *'Lemmings gonna lem, bro'*.

Is this really true? 
I want to believe so, but there remain [some serious unanswered questions]( about the 'non profits' receiving this money.

It is also human nature for people who have had to listen to their colleagues bragging about 'mad gainz' to then want to rub salt into the wound when the market turns.

May I ask you, why is 'market cap' important to you?
What does it mean to you?

It would not be long before [crowd psychology]( takes over and tulips become the next big thing.

Do you think it is partly a matter of envy from the naysayers that they missed out on the mad gainz of 2017, though?
As in, those who made a little bit of money and then got out, have less reason for the schadenfreude than those did not make any profits.
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:55:53
Would you feel sympathy if they lost their money from a legitimate investment rather than speculation?

Now this, this is good. It works on several levels. Indeed the satire is perhaps more pertinent to the 'original' use of the subject phrase than the adopted one here. That is to say, the best of a crazy woman is barely a fraction as good as her worst is bad. You sir are a scholar and a comedian.

So it is the best but it is not the best? Got it.

Too good.

What are you talking about, newfriend?

Let's all be honest: we had a lot of fun, feeling like geniuses.
May it happen again soon. Preferably before insolvency.

Lol, do people really believe this nonsense?

Did those same coworkers have to listen to you gloating late last year?

Let's hope you have learned your lessons.

Excellent point.
Imagine somebody saying 'HODL your Ford stocks! HODL or you are weak!'
@_date: 2018-02-06 23:38:26
So it is a technical definition, then?
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:39:33
No, you didn't.

But the youtube bitcoin gurus reckon the best way to chase bad money is to throw good money after it.
Do you disagree with the youtube bitcoin gurus?

I remember those people. Where are they now?
