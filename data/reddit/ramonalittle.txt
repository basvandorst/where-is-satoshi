$300 isn't pocket change. And even if it was $1, it's PDshotME's $1, and he should be able to withdraw it.

As someone who habitually puts two spaces after periods (because that's how I was taught), I can confirm that most if not all websites change two consecutive spaces to one space. I don't remember about Amazon specifically though.

Thanks for this.




This is the  thing confusing me. As pyalot said,


So with that hanging over his head, and government investigations, and a possible gag order as some have speculated, and the bankruptcy, and multiple pending lawsuits . . . how can he have such a blasé attitude? His "statements" are carelessly worded. Is [this]( the expression of someone in such dire straits? He looks almost smug.
I can't even think of a mental illness that would explain such complete disinterest in his own reputation and safety. In all seriousness, maybe a brain tumor destroyed whatever parts of his brain are responsible for self-preservation? I can't think of another explanation.

That wouldn't even surprise me.

It's extremely relevant. Autism causes problems with communication, and this whole thread is about Karpeles being bad at communication.

I made a similar observation [in another thread]( I don't know what's going on any more than anyone else, but there's definitely a disconnect between his expression and his public statements.

I'm starting to think this myself. He owes a lot of money to a lot of people -- and I'll wager that not all of them are peaceful and patient people -- and he's obviously not taking the situation seriously at all. 
Maybe he has to downplay the seriousness, as a kind of defense mechanism against complete panic? Because any normal person who managed to screw up at this level would probably be panicking at this point.

This isn't true at all. Journalists are like anyone else: some ethical and others less so. Journalists withhold sensitive information all the time, but you have no way of knowing about those instances unless the journalist tells you personally.

Or kidnap a member of his family. The article helpfully gave their names and workplaces.

I'm really hoping they don't post the dox on because I'll have to delete them.

I personally believe that U.S. Americans are unable to do so because, uh, some people out there in our nation don’t have maps, and, uh, I believe that our education like such as in South Africa and, uh, the Iraq everywhere like, such as and I believe that they should, our education over here in the US should help the US, er, should help South Africa and should help the Iraq and the Asian countries, so we will be able to build up our future for our children.

Except that they'll try to find a way to make these spreadsheets exciting for typical movie-goers. And hacking is always portrayed ludicrously. Expect glowing green numbers flying around the screen, and an inexplicable dance scene.

That's . . . that's amazing, actually.
It needs a third step. The coins get created, then stolen, then . . . destroyed, making the remaining ones more valuable? The math is beyond me, but I'd love to see someone create this, if only as a next step in cryptocoin evolution.

Not often, but occasionally. 
Yeah, pastebin is popular, and doxbin (on .onion).
