This is close, but I think the BCH would be taxable as income at the price on 8/1/17 (does anyone know what that initial price was?). Why wouldn't it be? In the case of this being held in a hardware wallet, purchased from a seller over a year ago, and then the entire amount of BCH being sold in 2017 it's still all short term or income on the BCH. When trying to later account for the taxes in order to transfer to fiat and then to a bank, this will all need to be accounted for. Finding a buyer on local bitcoins might not be a viable option, if the account is multiple bitcoins worth.

If you wait one year to redeem it (not recommended as BCH = shitcoin IMO) you'd pay long term capital gain on the difference between the initial price and the sale price, but still have 2017 tax due for the ICO price, as income. In my non-tax professional mind.

It's like a dividend, in that it's income. It's not actually a dividend however.

Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but all BTC hodlers as of 8/1/2017 have taxable income for 2017 from the hard fork (distribution) of BCH. Further, if they sold the BCH to buy BTC in 2017, that's short term capital gains. If you later attempt to sell you BTC for usd and transfer those USD to your bank, you'll have to show that you paid this tax, as well as your original cost basis so that you can pay the remaining tax due. This is true even if your BTC are in a hardware wallet and you only ever used an exchange to exchange your BCH  for BTC without ever using your name. The problem will be cashing out to fiat when it's time to do so, and having a tax record to show. This is my understanding, as a non-tax professional.

If you don't split your BCH? All hodlers of BTC on 8/1/17 received BCH, whether they claimed it or not. It's taxable income, in my non professional opinion.

That's my understanding. If the forked currency has value and can be accessed.

I can only say that I've seen it clarified here enough times, with better explanations that I can give, although I have no references to give you.

Incorrect. Trading crypto for crypto is considered a sell, and a taxable event. Again, not I'm not a tax advisor.

I haven't seen this explanation before. Interesting! Previously I'd seen it listed as income for the split. So then, transferring the BCH to an exchange and selling it to buy BTC would create a short term capital gain or a long term capital gain, assuming the BTC was owned more than a year? And using the proceeds to but BTC, those shares then have a new cost basis at the time of purchase. Seeing how this could be a bit complicated, and impact all holders of BTC as of August 1st, I'm surprised to have seen no discussion of it.
