circulating supply x price of coin
@_date: 2017-12-01 13:16:43
I️ think bitcoin being limited in supply (21 million EVER) lends itself to being a store of value, as there’s less incentive to actually spend it. And I️ think a crypto like gold asset can be very useful going forward.

Going to bed so here’s the short answer.. Yes. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:56:07
This. People talk about drops and corrections like they're inevitable. NO. If everyone thought the price was gonna drop 50% then don't you think that'd be priced in?? Sure coinbase could get hacked and we'll plummet, but BTC isn't gonna dump 'just bc we hit 10k.'
@_date: 2017-11-06 15:12:27
Why did it spike from $1300 to over $2000 a few days ago?
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:06:07
There’s always large sell walls at the 100, and especially 1000 price increments. And they always get obliterated when the time is right. At 9k there was a sell wall of about 250 btc, got chewed through in about 5 seconds. There’ll be a big one at 10k as well, nbd.

Get the app BTCNews, check/read reddit constantly, follow the price constantly. Everyday read read read. It's a big world, just try to learn something new everyday.

LOL please.. Bitcoin is a tiny fraction of its potential and has proven itself over time. It’s percentage share of the crypto market should be larger. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 00:55:53
When people feel it’s undervalued they buy, when overvalued they sell. BTC sustained nice support in lower 8000s, making that next leg up. Furthermore, nothing FUD worthy in near future. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 03:02:56
Big money isn’t dumb money. Guys like Dimon might talk a big game, but there’s no way they’re going to be shorting bitcoin right now - the upside just isn’t there. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:54:26
Translation: You’re being feasted upon. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:12:32
Agree, I think the market is going to be a bit all over the place for the next couple days as it tries to find itself.

Bitcoin's chart = the Y axis

Hi, Billy May here!
@_date: 2017-11-01 23:44:22
Lol.. more like SELL EVERYTHING
@_date: 2017-11-06 03:19:36
Yes, please panic
@_date: 2017-11-26 00:49:34
That’s a lot of green. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:50:53
definitely not me
@_date: 2017-11-02 04:02:13
Maybe in a few hours, maybe a few days, maybe after the fork. Regardless, it’ll get chewed up and blown away just like the rest of em. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:16:57
50 fold. 5-0. Fifty. 
Que. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:37:36
Coinbase seems to have taken a pretty straightforward way to sell your B2X (or hold) safely. I'd use them, personally.
@_date: 2017-11-02 04:00:49
I’ve actually held for 11 years. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:53:28
I lol’d to this. Thank you. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 03:07:25
Holy hell it’s only $100 higher than we started the day at! FUD PANIC SELL DUMP!!
@_date: 2017-10-31 01:25:41
Unless it’s like North Korea lol
@_date: 2017-10-25 01:34:58
So Coinbase chooses based off the community.. Poloniex decides off market cap.. Kraken chooses based on difficulty.. see where I’m going with this?
Let’s please not turn this into a massive mess and possibly Bitcoin’s demise. ����‍♂️
@_date: 2017-10-30 20:24:03
Who in their right mind would short BTC rn (for that amount nonetheless..)? What an absolute moron.
@_date: 2017-10-16 00:46:00
I'm contemplating keeping some on Poloniex and some in my Trezor. Is keeping it on an exchange during a fork a terrible idea? Thanks
@_date: 2017-10-31 02:00:31
Qué. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 17:04:45
What about the one on the right?
@_date: 2017-10-18 02:36:37
Can you embellish a little more on B2X lacking any real support? I know support seems to be fading, but technically speaking, 80% of miners are still on board, right?
@_date: 2017-10-24 23:15:31
You don’t have to lol. In fact, I would hope you don’t listen to everything you see on large public message boards.. 
PS.. currently showing good support at $5500 ;)
@_date: 2017-10-25 00:54:47
I hope you’re right ��
@_date: 2017-10-25 02:41:16
Yep. Down we gooooo
@_date: 2017-10-18 02:38:11
Doesn't part of you think Bitcoin's potential could be damaged if the B2X chain emerges, while the original Bitcoin (BTC) still exists? Thus, creating greater uncertainty among outsiders and further skepticism. 
@_date: 2017-10-25 02:20:35
I agree. This may be a big threat, but there will be bigger and far graver ones down the road. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 22:13:22
you should sell though
@_date: 2017-10-25 00:09:00
I’m skeptical about how much lower it’ll go, especially if it holds $5500 tonight. SegWit2x is looking less and less likely by the day, as fears ease, buyers will become more confident and price should move up (you would think). 
@_date: 2017-10-24 22:16:45
Look at the recent pull backs after big run ups. Nothing especially significant that is driving the price down either. IMO lots of people who came in for BTG fork and now are running back to alts. Kick out the weak hands and start the next leg up. User base continues to grow, people are becoming more and more interested, institutional money is beginning to get in. This is a healthy pull back (again IMO) and a nice buying opportunity. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 01:25:19
Why? Wouldn’t any nation looking to adopt bitcoin and implement it into daily life be a sheer positive?
@_date: 2017-10-23 04:04:29
Just graduated school in May and have almost all of saving in cryptos. I very well might lose my entire investment, but it can also be a 10x + return. And I think the upside heavily outweighs the downside. You don’t get investment opportunities like this too often, jump in and be apart of something that is gonna revolutionize the world. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 22:10:24
DO NOT SELL. Buy a little now, buy a little more if it dips some more.
@_date: 2017-10-25 02:33:37
You right! Thanks
@_date: 2017-10-25 02:19:22
We will make a determination on this change, once we believe the forks are in a stable state. We may consider other factors such as market cap or community support to determine stability.
Says they may also consider other factors..
