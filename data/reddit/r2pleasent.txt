Cross-post to bitcoinmarkets:
So, today Bitfinex announced that withdrawals and deposits are reopened. I logged into my account today, completed my 2 FA, and then I was met with this window:
Alright, no problem. I pressed Request Password Reset Email. Looks good:
Now, I press "RESET PASSWORD".
Say what?? Repeated the above steps on multiple different browsers, tried using Incognito. Nothing works. I simply cannot access my account, while others seem to have no problems. Is anyone else facing this issue? Are we the predetermined bag holders? Why would some accounts be capable of logging in, while others are not??
 ??
EDIT: FIXED THROUGH SUPPORT, thanks

The keys never belonged to anyone aside from Bitfinex.  No user had control of their address.  The attackers used a vector on the Bitfinex system itself, not one which targeted users individually.  For that reason, I think it makes sense to socialize the losses among all Bitcoin balances.

The dude is still at it.  Here's his new attempt today:
Fortunately we're now checking for 1 confirmation.  But this guy continues trying even after we've clearly caught onto him.
@_date: 2016-08-28 05:18:50
Yes, and I did have it set to 1 confirmation.  However, the IPN alerts us immediately at 0 confirmations, and then we get an email @ 6 confirmations.  I don't really understand how the system notifies you at 1 confirmation.  I have the speed set to "Medium", which means 1-confirmation.  But they don't email us or mark it explicitly anywhere on their dashboard when it hits 1 confirmation.
For now I'm having my agents use a user account to manually check transactions and ensure they have 1 confirmation before delivering.  The Bitpay system could use some major improvements.

We don't get very many Bitcoin orders.  Maybe 10 per day max.  It's very easy to tell his apart from others.  We collect a bunch of information, like their IP address and in-game account name.  It's very clear that these were the only orders he placed all day.  You can see on Bitpay they are all consecutively placed.

Many businesses need quick access to BTC/USD trading, without exposing their balance to BTC price movements.  How does a business hold USD for the purpose of readily buying BTC without holding that USD on an exchange?
@_date: 2016-08-03 22:57:59
But how is it even relevant whose accounts lost bitcoin?  Like, we log in and see that our bitcoin balance is gone, so what?  The only reason I can think of for this to be relevant, is that people who were directly affected will be in a different situation than those whose deposit addresses happened to not be liquidated.
@_date: 2016-08-08 15:54:09
Well, to be able to properly execute the theft, it's likely that the thief had access to the Bitfinex system for much longer than just the 2 hours they spent liquidating the Bitcoin wallets.  It was a well executed attack that bypassed whatever security practices were in place.  Even if you argue that the security failed, the attacker probably had to figure out that it was going to fail before making his move.  This takes time and analysis.
So, there's a very strong likelihood that the attacker had access for weeks.  I've seen some charts that shows P2SH address movements weeks before, that may indicate several test runs.  In this case, it would be reasonable to assume that they could have stolen the user data as well.

Yes, an exchange has a much different set of risks than an individual's wallet.  An exchange must handle automated payouts.  Multiple people have access to the systems.  The potential payout from hacking an exchange is massive, and therefore warrants much more time and focus.
Compare that to hacking individuals, who are using different software / security.  A highly skilled hacker who is capable of hacking individual wallets in a consistent manner would likely have a high value of their own time.  At least $200-300 / hour.  
It's hard to say what type of attack vector would even work consistently for attacking individual bitcoin users.  The most reliable would be directing Bitcoin users to a zero day attack.  However, an unpatched zero day is worth hundreds of thousands of dollars on the black market, if you can manage to get your hands on one of the few that are found each year.  
@_date: 2016-08-28 04:36:48
I do not believe this setting exists.  I only see:
We had this setting selected already.  However, by default the IPN notifies us immediately once a payment has been initiated.  There is no way to change that.  We are notified immediately once a payment has been sent (0 confirms), and then again when it hits 6 confirms.  I am not sure what relevance this medium-speed setting has on Bitpay.  There is no type of notification that I can see when a transaction hits 1 confirm
@_date: 2016-08-10 02:43:06
Agreed.  As of right now, we've gotten 0%.  Let's keep that in mind.  So far Bitfinex hasn't paid out a fucking penny.  They've got our money locked up.  We'll talk about the haircut when the withdrawal button is working.  Until then the haircut has been 100%.

In this case, he was successful on 5/5 transactions.  
@_date: 2016-08-04 20:42:31
Here, zane specifically outlines that there were supposed to be withdrawal limits, and those limits were bypassed.
BitGo's systems must be flawed for something as basic as a withdrawal limit to be over ridden.  I think that anybody would agree, any withdrawal limit created with BitGo serves no purpose if it can be bypassed by Bitfinex.  The only proper implementation of such a limit would involve multiple human parties to edit the limit.
What is being implied is that the withdrawal limit was modifiable by Bitfinex without it being manually reviewed.  This is a major lapse in security.  Any security system dealing with such sensitive financial instruments should have manual reviews in place at some level.  It's really just a few lines of code.
It's one thing for BitGo to allow Bitfinex to increase the withdrawal limit by 10-20% without triggering a manual review.  But in this case, 120,000~ BTC was withdrawn in a couple of hours.  I would imagine that is 20-50x the average daily withdrawal volume.  Who knows what the daily withdrawal limits were, but they were clearly much lower than 120,000 BTC.  Whatever algorithms or security practices are in place at BitGo should have picked this up.
@_date: 2016-08-28 22:22:29
From what I can see, Bitpay's systems did not pick up on the double spend for 30+ minutes.  I could see the transaction was a double-spend on blockchain.info in real time.  During this time, Bitpay's insight tool simply showed the transaction as 0 confirmations, with no mention of a double-spend.
Bitpay holds the merchant accountable for double-spends.  They have made no offer to reimburse me for the transactions.  I expected this to be the case, but a lot of people are under the impression that they provide some sort of insurance or protection against double-spends.  They do not.  Without manually copy-pasting the transaction hash onto another website (in this case, blockchain.info), I would have no way of knowing it was a double-spend.
EDIT: For example, just input b565b78f059bd6a441fb49aaf513434eb6038f38f5d0bb32222f3d65e6788a4b into  -- it simply says "transaction not found".  Search that same transaction on  -- it shows that it was a double-spend, and links to the other transaction in the double-spend the moment it is broadcast.

This is a whole bunch of nothing.  What you described as a benefit is "BitGo cannot run away with your funds".  BitGo is clearly providing a service here, and they describe it themselves on their own website.  Their service extends beyond "not stealing your funds".  
Here's a list of the services they provide:


No.  I disagree.  BitGo's entire value proposition in terms of security in a 2-of-3 setup is that for a transaction to clear, both BitGo and the client (Bitfinex in this case) must sign a transaction.  If the client can sign on BitGo's behalf, then quite frankly the security added by this setup is not 2-of-3 in any sense, it is actually worse than 1-of-1.

You need to be honest with yourself.  What outcome will create a better payoff to yourself than the 64% + BFX Tokens?
a) Bitfinex is insolvent, taken to court, hacker at large. 
ETA for payout = 2 years+
Payout % = Total Assets, minus legal fees, split across creditors + other stakeholders.  Max 70%, likely 50% or less.  Numbers are vague and uncertain.
b) Bitfinex pays out your 64% + BFX Token.
ETA for payout = couple of weeks
Payout % = 64% flat, and a "BFX Token" which will be worth SOMETHING.  Even if it is only worth 20% of its face value, that brings the payout to 71.2%.
c) Bitfinex is proven through an investigation to have robbed its own exchange
ETA for payout = 1-3 Years AFTER a lengthy and complicated investigation.  Highly unlikely.
Payout % = ??? still not 100%
Just not sure what scenario you're waiting for that beats B.  You can still pursue A and C after B is completed, as well.  That has the highest Expected Value.

The Mt Gox "hack" was more likely just the company operating a fractional reserve and just generally acting against customer interests.  There were no specific transactions that suddenly happened where the exchange went from solvent to insolvent.  Instead it was a slow process which squeezed consumer funds from their hands over a period of years.
This meant that there were no major transactions one could follow in the way we will see here with the Bitfinex hack.  The liquidation of Bitfinex BTC happened on a bunch of known addresses in a very small period of time.  We can all clearly see where they are right now, and no doubt they will be watched with intense scrutiny.  It will be very interesting to see what this hacker / thief does with their spoils.
Judging by how complex and utterly effective this hack was, the thief was either an insider or highly intelligent.  To execute such a massive heist on an exchange which was hooked up with BitGo means they must have really dug deep into the code and been working on this for quite some time.  They were able to find absolutely massive flaws in the system which went unnoticed by BitGo or Bitfinex.

Right but I don't think this attack involved logging into anything at a user level.  If it did, then why were only BTC balances affected?  I had USD in my account, but only my BTC was taken (according to Bitfinex).
What you are looking at is the individual users' withdrawal limits.  What I am discussing is the broader withdrawal limits of Bitfinex as a whole, which clearly existed.
EDIT: From what it looks like, the attacker used some sort of database to do a mass liquidation.  This did not require them to log into individual users' accounts.

Bitpay sends an email at 0 confirmations, and at 6 confirmations.  They used to send one at n confirmations, but discontinued that service.  From what I can see, there is no way to edit these settings.
EDIT: Quite frustrating, because 6 confirmations are just straight up unnecessary for 99.99% of merchants, and 0 confirmation transactions are the only real risks of double spends.

The fact is this has a much smaller impact than Circle.  Hedging can be achieved in many ways.  Most companies who accept Bitcoin hedge their BTC transactions automatically by immediately trading the BTC for USD.
Hedging can also be done by purchasing options on multiple different platforms such as Bitfinex and OKCoin.  Hedging can also be done manually.  Let's say I am a business and I am accepting Bitcoin from another business.  I receive the Bitcoin to my Bitstamp account.  I instantly sell the Bitcoin for USD when the transaction clears.
I'm really not sure where you got the idea that hedging is a new thing in the Bitcoin world.  Many active traders use a variety of different hedging methods everyday already.

Correlations may not be perfectly consistent over time, but they don't need to be.  So long as gold prices do not suddenly begin to peg themselves to the US stock market, they will provide diversification benefits to most portfolios.
If, by some highly unlikely circumstance, gold prices became perfectly positively correlated to the stock markets, then at the end of the day you effectively have 5-10% more invested in the stock market.  Not exactly the end of the world.
In the long run, it is essentially impossible that gold prices will be perfectly positively or negatively correlated to the stock market.  They are driven by completely different factors.

Gold is a great diversifying asset in a portfolio.  It is not strongly correlated to the stock markets, so you can use it to reduce the volatility of a portfolio in most cases.  
Furthermore, considering that governments strongly value gold as a store of value, it's probably not going to fall off the deep end anytime soon.  It may see some rocky roads in the near-future, but in the long-term I think gold is a safe bet for 5-10% of your portfolio.

I agree with your first point, BTC makes it infinitely easier to transfer money in/out of China.  At least, for now.  Here's what you want to start shitting your pants about, again:
Basically, a drafted bill in China restricts bank to bank and third party transfers to almost nothing.  This will have a profound effect on the functions of BTC sites within China.  Right now the limit is essentially non-existent.  You can send 50,000 CNY in one day on Alipay.  The new bill will have a MONTHLY limit of 10,000 CNY (~$1610).
As for BTC being used directly on goods in China -- this is not coming anytime soon.  The government hammered down on this practice.  It is illegal to price goods in anything other than RMB.  Welcome to capital controls.  Why did you think it was so hard to get money into the country in the first place.
Basically, this draft is very bad news for all electronic business in China.  It may not immediately actually impact BTC exchanges, depending on how it is interpreted.  It looks to ban **"transfers from bank accounts to accounts managed by third-party companies"**.
If you ask me, the writing is on the wall.  Within the next year BTC is going to be fully underground in China.  Very unfortunate.

Trust me, I am a huge believer in virtual currencies.  I have been trading MMORPG gold since 2007, and have been trading Bitcoin since 2010.  Google my username if you want to check out my background / business.
I just try not to look through rose-coloured glasses.  Bitcoin has not yet come close to making a major impact on the financial sector.  It has plenty of challenges to overcome, and it is certainly not a foregone conclusion that it will reach the adoption levels of the internet / email.  While there are examples of technology that have been widely successful, there are countless more that have not.
Bitcoin needs to become more friendly to the average user to become successful.  I don't think anyone can argue this fact.  We aren't there yet.  Bitcoin does not yet provide the average person with enough utility to reach mass adoption.
I believe that it can hit mass adoption, but plenty more innovation is needed.  The main issues that I outlined are that for consumers, a Bitcoin transaction is actually two transactions.  One to buy the Bitcoins, another to buy the item with the Bitcoins.  The challenges lie in making this two-step process easier than other transactions, which are essentially one-step processes for the consumer.
To give an example of services that have turned a two-step process into a simple transaction: credit cards.  When you make a purchase with a credit card, you are actually taking a loan from Visa / Mastercard, and then Visa / Mastercard pay the merchant.  This is a two-step transaction which is just as easy as paying with cash.

ApplePay is moving forward NFC payment to the masses.  I think many people realize that NFC payment would complement Bitcoin extremely well.  I truly hope ApplePay moves forward and is successful.  The advances and adoption by consumers with NFC payments will pave the way for a simple Bitcoin application which truly can be accepted by average people.
Let Apple be the first mover, figure out the security issues, and iron out the bugs.  Once that's done, creating a Bitcoin NFC add-on will be extremely simple.  Stop acting as if these companies are directly competing with Bitcoin right now.  Bitcoin isn't there yet.

Winklevoss twins believe market cap should be $400B.  Well, that might have something to do with them holding a metric shit ton of Bitcoins.  They'll be self-made billionaires who made their money by suing Facebook and then investing the funds into a purely-speculative digital asset.  Talk about dumb luck.
Bitcoin being valued at $100,000+ is probably the most ridiculous bullshit I have ever seen.  That would be an ultimate market cap of $2 Trillion+.  That's higher than the nominal GDP of Canada / India.  There is no way in hell Bitcoin has any chance of hitting $1 Trillion+ market cap without some amazing innovation which would need to be bigger than the Bitcoin protocol itself.
People need to realize that holding 1 BTC isn't going to make them rich.  Hell, if Bitcoin could maintain a $1,000 price by 2016 that would be a huge accomplishment.  You guys are expecting ridiculous growth without any justification.  The average United States citizen has very little use for Bitcoin at the moment.  Unless you're looking to launder money (cash is still better for this) / sell drugs / move wealth across borders, there's very little reason to use Bitcoin.
It's great accepting it as a merchant since it's low-commitment and advantageous to sellers.  0 buyer protection, low processing fees and instant conversion to fiat currency are some strong features for merchants.  But why does a consumer want to use Bitcoin?  Every advantage to the merchant is essentially a disadvantage to the consumer:
- 0 buyer protection: self explanatory
- Low processing fees: Sure, for the merchants.  Buyers need to acquire BTC through an exchange and are looking at wire transfer fees / trading fees / bid-ask spread
- Instant fiat conversion: Not for the consumer.  They need to buy BTC and once they do they are exposed to fluctuations in its value until it is spent
People are paid salaries in fiat, they pay their mortgages in fiat, and their government-recognized investments are in fiat.  Fiat is not going anywhere.  It's deeply ingrained into the world financial system.
At best, Bitcoin will complement the fiat-driven markets.  It will facilitate money-transfer, it will be a useful tool for transactions which do not function with traditional buyer protection (irreversible virtual asset transfer), and it will continue to be a very high-volatility speculative-driven investment.  But it's not the answer for a new-age financial system.  
It provides some interesting solutions to problems, but also creates its own new problems in the process.
Edit: Thanks for the gold!

The funny thing is that regulating Bitcoin will have very little effect.  If it becomes highly regulated, and criminals get spooked, it will only fuel innovation of a more anonymous crypto-currency.  The US government is walking on thin ice here.  They need to realize that they have it pretty good right now with Bitcoin.
All major exchanges have implemented KYC + AML.  Bitcoin transaction ledgers are public and list all transactions ever made in the network.  This is already much more transparent than cash transactions.  Obviously there are still criminals slipping through the cracks, but there are criminals on Western Union / Paypal / etc. as well.  You'll never eradicate them entirely.

Sorry, but Bitcoin is not being seen by any governments as a world currency.  Although it's progressed greatly in nearly every sense, it's still just a speck on the wall to these guys.  Nobody's economy is going to see any noticeable effect right now from banning Bitcoin exchanges.
Bitcoin allows people to avoid all the capital controls in China.  The government would not have gone to the massive extent of creating and maintaining this system just for Bitcoin to come along and circumvent it all.  China has very little to gain from Bitcoin.  
If they wanted a more open currency they could just create one themselves.  Then they'd at least still have control of it.  Bitcoin offers very little advantages to a government with China's ideals.  The people of China aren't as passionate about the politics of Bitcoin, either.  They are speculating on the currency simply because it is highly accessible and there are very little options in China for investment.

You have a very loose definition on earning money.  If the scenario the OP is speaking of comes in the near future (which it won't), then there will be certain people with ridiculous amounts of wealth.  For example, if Satoshi is really one person and has access to all the original wallets, he would have ~10% of total BTC.
This would, according to the hypothetical situation, make him by far the wealthiest person in the entire world.  Not only that, but now that the entire world uses Bitcoin, he has the ability to control the value of Bitcoin completely.  He can manipulate the market massively and essentially just toy with everybody else using Bitcoin. 
In this situation, capitalism crashes upon itself without regulation.  It's the equivalent of a massive monopoly.  One person controlling 10% of the money supply is absolutely bonkers.  The playing field is not level when somebody can easily move the market in whichever direction they choose.
Basically, if Bitcoin got this big, it would need to be massively regulated, or we'd see a new level of wealth inequality that would make current USA look like a communist country.

1) Look at the profile of the 3rd party on the forum.  Is he highly trusted?  Has he made many large trades?  Has he been around for a long time?  Anyone trusted enough to escrow or middleman a transaction should be very trusted, otherwise what's the point?  Just adds another point of failure
2) CONFIRM THEIR IDENTITY!  Just because someone has a Skype display name similar to the person, or claims to be that person, DOES NOT MEAN THEY ARE ACTUALLY THAT PERSON.  Get a Private Message from their forum profile with the details of the trade inside, as well as copy pasted messages of your communication.  Get them to send you their Bitcoin address via Private Forum Message as well.

The problem I have is with people comparing Bitcoin to Gold as if they are similar assets.  They are not.  Gold is a physical store of value which has been used for hundreds / thousands of years.  It is used by governments across the world to store value in large quantities.
You asked me purely: Why would you invest in gold?  So I answered why someone might be interested in investing in gold.
Bitcoin does provide diversification to a portfolio, but due to its volatility, it will always increase the overall volatility of a portfolio.  The main purpose of diversification is to REDUCE volatility, so Bitcoin may not be a good choice for most people.
If you want to compare Bitcoin to another asset, the most comparable would be a penny stock.  Bitcoin has volatility and price shift which resembles that of penny stocks.  So, if you're looking for investors who have high risk appetites and speculation-driven trading, look at them.

Really good translation done in  by 
Original: 
In a recent meeting, the PBOC publicly criticized two banks, Bank of China and China Merchants Bank, that still provide services to BTCChina.
PBOC Official Mu reaffirms their policies on Bitcoin which stated all financial institutions cannot directly or indirectly provide services to Bitcoin related companies.
After the crackdown on Bitcoin, many Bitcoin exchanges, including Huobi and OKCoin, find ways to bypass regulation by creating “deposit codes” and allow customer to purchase or trade these codes through online stores.
Recently, OKCoin announced their new “deposit codes” system. The new system will allow customers convert their CNY deposits at the exchange into codes of equivalent value. They can either transfer these codes to other customers on the exchange or sell them at online stores or other public marketplaces. Huobi and BTCChina also have a similar system.
During the recent meeting, the PBOC clarified some languages in their policies. One PBOC official said, “The current level of services that banks and third-party payment processors provide counts as directly providing services to Bitcoin related companies. Online stores and public marketplaces that sells or trades “deposit codes” from Bitcoin exchanges counts as indirectly providing services to Bitcoin related companies”. The PBOC official made clear that both of kinds of services must stop. Banks and third-party payment processors must close their payment terminals at these exchanges and terminate their accounts immediately.
As of April 24th, Bitcoin exchanges had closed most of their deposit channels including banks and third-party processors. However, some banks are still providing deposit and withdraw services to Bitcoin exchanges.
Also stressed during the PBOC meeting is that withdraws of CNY through Bitcoin exchanges must end as well. The PBOC is asking all government agencies to monitor Bitcoin related money transfers. Agencies must respond swiftly to the list of bank accounts that the PBOC sent out.

Well, let's look at some facts:
1) MtGox mismanaged millions of dollars, through either negligence or fraud, and claims to have "lost" over $250,000,000 USD worth of Bitcoins
2) MtGox misled their customers into believing that all balances were accounted for right up until they shut down
3) MtGox has some sketchy bot which was not explained in any of their disclosures of their business, and accounted for ~7% of total Bitcoin transactions during its hay-day.  
The simplest explanation?  They used this bot to manipulate the market.  Their imaginary MtGox USD was used to pump up the price of Bitcoin, and as they did it, they only let a trickle of the money out of the system.  For every 10 MtGox USD they spent manipulating the market, users could only withdraw 10-20% of it.

In the last 2 years one Bitcoin would have been worth between 0.1 and 12 barrels of crude oil.  100 USD would have been worth between 0.8 and 3 barrels of crude oil.
12 / 0.1 = 120
3 / 0.8 = 3.75
120 / 3.75 = 32
So in terms of the price of a barrel of oil, Bitcoin's price extremes were 32 times more volatile in the past year.

Actually, I disagree.  They have different pros and cons.  Mint chips will be tied to the CAD, so they will be extremely stable.  Plus, they are supported by a government, and therefore will be much more attractive to merchants.  Canadians will likely be able to cash in and out of mint chips with just a few clicks of an app / online banking interface.
Mintchips seem to be more practical for everyday purchases.  Bitcoins can take hours / days to purchase, values swing +/- 5% on a good day, +/- 20% on a volatile one.  
Obviously, Mintchips are centralized and therefore not equivalent to Bitcoins.  However, they do avoid a lot of hassles present in both the banking system and the bitcoin system.  It's somewhat of a hybrid between real crypto and traditional fiat.  
If I want to send a friend $100 in Canada right now, here are my options:
1) Sign into online banking - Send interac email transfer - $1-1.50 fee per transaction ($1000 max) - 30 minutes processing time - requires bank account at participating financial institution.
2) Give them cash in person
3) If they are at the same bank, get their transit number + account number, call the bank and have them transfer money to their account (5-20 minutes)
If I have Mint chips already?  This transaction takes &lt;30 seconds.  Money is available immediately.
Mint Chips as they are planned do not offer anything in terms of international commerce.  This is where things would start to get a lot more complicated.  Would other countries really support a Canadian crypto?  Probably not.  If Mint Chips catch on, then expect other countries to follow with their own version of them.  
Now, to send someone in USA money with Mint chips, I'd need to find an exchanger which trades me USD-Chips for my CAD Mint Chips.  Then I could send those USD-Chips to someone in the USA and they are available to use.  They could also receive CAD Mint Chips and exchange them themselves. 
Ideally, the commissions charged on these exchanges should be much lower than what is available at banks today.  Banks tend to add a 2-3% commission to currency exchanges in Canada, it's extremely high.  If a company was able to process these exchanges electronically, then the fees should be very low, since the transaction costs are near 0%.  It would be like a Cryptsy exchange.

Your argument is that people can still meet up in person and trade cash for BTC, therefore demand will remain equal.
That's silly.  Exchanges without bank accounts makes the process of buying/selling BTC much more difficult.  Instead of sending a quick online bank transfer to a highly trusted exchange, I must instead find a person nearby who is selling BTC at the price I want, and then meet them in person.

The interesting thing about Bitcoin is that the system is marginally improved every day, whether we notice it or not.  Companies are innovating on top of the Blockchain to find better ways to use the technology.  The regulatory landscape is being clarified further, which will provide more confidence to investors of Bitcoin-based technology.
This whole thing about merchant acceptance is overplayed.  The fact that Microsoft accepts Bitcoin for a portion of their product range is not what increases the value of Bitcoin.  That is not a permanent incremental improvement on the technology.  It's just a retailer signing up for a Bitpay account.  They could close their account tomorrow and we'd be right back where we are today.  Furthermore, merchants have always had strong incentive to use Bitcoin, it's consumer adoption that will be difficult to incentivize.
I think the future is bright, but you guys expecting this to be a get-rich-quick scenario are going to have to face reality.  Bitcoin is in no rush to $10,000 or even $1,000.  There's a ton of improvement needed on security, consumer adoption, ease of use, and other extremely basic requirements before Bitcoin has mainstream utility.

By preventing exchanges from using bank accounts, the PBOC removes:
- Legitimacy
- Liquidity
- Simplicity
From the Chinese Bitcoin market.  Yes, if people are willing to put in a bunch more effort, they can still buy and sell BTC.  But they'll incur higher costs, higher risks, and greater hassle when making the transaction.
This is about accessibility.
EDIT: Let me add that in the medium/long run I'm sure the Chinese people will figure out a way past many of the limitations.  This is a country with a history of squirming around government controls.  But it's not going to happen overnight, and it will still never match the liquidity, legitimacy, and simplicity of an exchange.
It will, however, drive innovation in decentralized exchange(s), which in the long-term is beneficial to Bitcoin itself.

If I lived in China, would I suddenly get direct access to the PBOC's future plans?  Be realistic, China has taken big steps in ensuring BTC exchanges are shut down within the country.  It's quite obvious that they are looking to make it impossible to trade RMB (domestic currency) for BTC.
This new deposit method for OKCoin / BTC China allows users to buy Bitcoin cards anonymously with cash.  There's nothing posted about purchase limits.  Currently, exchanges require a user to provide photo ID when transacting.  These cards skip that step.  They allow people to transfer wealth with very little paper trail.
These systems would likely not even be legal in the United States.  
The Chinese government has realized that you don't get rid of Bitcoin by banning it outright, you get rid of Bitcoin by cutting it off from the financial system.  It's not realistic to throw every person in jail for buying a Bitcoin.

Some of his points demonstrate his complete lack of understanding of how the Bitcoin network functions.  Specifically when he says that Bitcoins can be replicated, that part is just silly.  Did he really think that BTC would be worth $800+ each if they could be replicated?
Now, as for his major point, that part is completely correct.  The government has a ton of KYC (Know Your Customer) requirements on these types of payment systems, and you're a fool to argue that the Bitcoin network fulfills these goals.  Just because a transaction appears in the Blockchain, or BTC-e asks for photo ID during a bank wire, does not mean that Bitcoin transactions are meeting KYC standards.
Right now, there are several theories on why government is allowing BTC trade to continue, despite the inabilities of the system to meet KYC requirements.  One theory is that due to recent successes in taking out major violators using the BTC network (DPR, other SR operators, etc.), that they have a false sense of control on the system.  Indeed, lately they have actually been able to trace a lot of illicit activity.
However, as the network grows/evolves, different services begin popping up, and volume increases, you can expect the web to be more and more blinding to authorities.  Those who are truly interested in remaining anonymous over the Bitcoin network should have the capability to do so.  And when that becomes a clear truth to the government, that transactions are completely outside of their surveillance and control, do you really believe they will support this system?
There is absolutely no way they would.  Unless theory  is correct, and that always gets scrutinized.  The NSA created Bitcoin.  If the NSA truly did create Bitcoin, then all this is a moot point.  In such a case, they have aligned the system with their surveillance program and are able to monitor/control transactions.  Many will say this is silly and just blind speculation.  I agree, at this point there's nothing which proves this to be correct.  However, based on the NSA's knowledge of cryptography and wealth transfer systems, do not act as if it is impossible by any means.
Do not trust that the government is pro-Bitcoin, or even pro-innovation.  The primary purpose of government is to maintain its own power.  The fundamentals behind Bitcoin are intended to take government out of the equation as much as possible.  That is the idea.  To suddenly trust that central authority is friendly to a system which looks to break free from central authority is foolish and short-sighted.  Expect a long battle if things really do start heating up.

The 0.1% of the population stat is misleading.  It makes it sound small and that doubling is an easy feat.  Maybe only 1% of the world owns Apple stock.  You could say that 2% is "doable".  Based on what though, exactly?  That 1% is a small number and 2% is pretty small too?
Don't throw percentages around and act like their values themselves provide context.  I see it EVERYWHERE in the Bitcoin world.  Instead of throwing mindless statistics around, tell me WHY Bitcoin adoption will increase instead of decrease.  What makes Bitcoin more attractive tomorrow than today?

You sure are optimistic.  Right now it's only words.  Their actions up to this point have shown nothing to back them up.  If they really wanted to be the leaders, they could have done a lot to make the regulation process more accessible and realistic.  
Right now, the US government has been the leader in prosecuting Bitcoin-related businesses and shutting them down.  Even if NY tries to push forward licenses and regulate a Bitcoin Exchange, they'll still have one hell of a time doing business out of state.  From what I understand, each state requires a separate money transmission license, which can have different requirements from NY.
I guess Coinbase has made it work, so it's obviously possible.  But from what I gather they had a ton of connections within the financial industry, and are still having a hard time.

Unfortunately, Chinese businesses are forbidden from selling products for Bitcoin.  While Bitcoin is still useful for converting CNY to foreign currency, it's still difficult to catch on when people in China can't use it to make purchases.
I wonder if a company who offered a similar service to Bitpay, but one which made the conversion buyer-side, right before a purchase on a Chinese online retailer would fill this need.

Aaron makes several valid points on the current Bitcoin ecosystem.  The 51% attacks, and the centralization of firms providing a bridge to the traditional financial system are certainly long-term problems.  However, these have little effect on consumer adoption.
Bitcoin's main challenge has been providing value to consumers on the Bitcoin network.  For merchants, the value is already apparent.  Bitcoin transactions have low fees, are not subject to fraud, and they can easily avoid exchange rate risk by using Bitpay or Coinbase.  
For those spending Bitcoin, these advantages do not translate.  Buying Bitcoin often carries implicit fees, such as exchange rate commission, money transfer fees, and exchange rate risk.  This is accompanied with reduced buyer protection on transactions.
The fundamental reality is that, for a customer to buy something at Walmart with Bitcoin, they need to do 2 transactions.  They need to buy Bitcoin with fiat currency, and then buy their product in Bitcoin.  Until these two transactions become easier than the single transaction required to buy goods traditionally, Bitcoin will struggle to gain consumer adoption.

Nothing's impossible dude.  But you aren't telling me any reason WHY 15-20% of the gold market is going to suddenly switch over to Bitcoin over the next two years.  Gold prices do not show any noticeable correlation with Bitcoin prices from any data that I have seen.  So what is the relationship between the two assets which makes you think that a massive amount of gold owners will suddenly switch to Bitcoin?
The majority of gold is owned by governments and I can tell you right now they are not switching over to Bitcoin anytime soon.  In the ~5 years of Bitcoin's existence, it hasn't even captured 0.1% of the gold market, even if we assume every dollar in Bitcoin's market cap is from people selling bullion.  So how on Earth, by 2016, do you expect the Bitcoin market (which, aside from being a store of value, has very little in common with gold), to suddenly capture 15-20% of that market?

Usually if you are going to raise money, you raise it because you need it for something.  You don't raise $10M in capital for it to sit in cash reserves.  It costs the company money to raise it, so they need to invest it into projects which return positive NPV.
That could mean hiring staff, investing in other businesses, marketing, and infrastructure.  Likely a combination of everything.  Either way, the odds are that $10M is no longer sitting in liquid assets.

A falling BTC price could definitely impact their abilities to remain afloat.  To honor customers' fiat withdrawals, they would need to sell more and more customers' Bitcoins.  Which in turn leads to a depletion of BTC.  So yes, a falling BTC price can expose a ponzi.  
The same with rising BTC prices.  If BTC rises abruptly, and they don't have appropriate BTC reserves to pay BTC back, then they need to dip into fiat reserves.  The only way a ponzi runs relatively smoothly is with a static price.

To put it in further perspective, the company reported a profit of $830K for 2013.  At current rates, the ~19K stolen BTC represents ~$5.13M.  If they need to rebuy the full amount of BTC in a short amount of time, it will likely cost more than that.  
So the amount that they have lost is more than 6x 2013 profit.  That's going to be a real tough pill to swallow for Bitstamp shareholders.  6 years in the world of Bitcoin is a very long time.  Heck, 6 years ago Bitcoin was a fetus.  This is a huge, huge deal, and could easily bankrupt the company.

This "Bitcoin ATM" that BTC China has developed is not an ATM.
ATM = Automated Teller Machine
This is not an automated machine at all.  I can't set up this program and have it buy/sell Bitcoins for me automatically.  Someone needs to manually accept the cash, and then send out the Bitcoins in return for that cash.
This has very little difference from a Bitcoin wallet itself.  If I have a  Blockchain.info wallet on my phone, I could easily take somebody's cash and send them Bitcoin.  The main difference according to BTC China is that I don't need to wait for 6 confirmations from them?

Most merchants would happily give a discount for using Bitcoin.

What he's saying likely echoes conversations had within BNP Paribas.  It's quite reasonable to believe that banks are beginning to identify Bitcoin as a future threat to their business.  It's stuck around now for awhile now, and currently has a market cap just under $4B USD.  To put that in perspective, Stripe just recently looked for a valuation of ~$5B USD.  
Furthermore, the Blockchain itself is an undeniable innovation with applications to the financial systems described in the article.  Anyone with a decent understanding of the Blockchain can see how it could be used to provide a trusted ledger to nearly any type of business.  It simply allows for proof of asset ownership, which is a service right now being offered by the banks.

As for taking down the Bitcoin protocol, would it really be that difficult if the US government wanted to?  Shut down exchanges using USD, attack the Bitcoin network with their billions of dollars in cyber-warfare infrastructure.  Once you create distrust in the network itself, the mainstream population is not going to want to use it.  Once that trust in the network is gone, it is much more difficult to regain.
I don't think the US government sees Bitcoin as a threat to the fiat system.  They also know their abilities and power.

While I agree with your numbers, they don't necessarily tell the full story.  In my business, I need to cap the amounts that customers can buy on Credit Card / PayPal.  That is because the likelihood of fraud increases rapidly as transaction size increases.  A $1,000 USD order is much more likely to be fraudulent than a $10 USD order.  The risk is also much more diversified when accepting 100 orders for $10 as opposed to 1 order for $1000.
Because of the risk, we often will have to turn away legitimate customers after they have reached a certain volume in a certain time period.  Although our chargeback rate implies the cost of accepting further orders is ~0.7% * the order total, and therefore should be completely acceptable, we simply do not take further orders once the limit is reached.
Therefore, payment methods such as Bitcoin allow us to continue processing orders that we would normally turn away.  For that reason, we will often offer substantial discounts for large Bitcoin orders.  Now, my business is quite unique in the sense that we provide digital products for online games, but it still shows use cases where a 5%+ discount for using Bitcoin makes sense.
Either way though, merchants will not do this simply because they read a post on Reddit.  They will do this because they value the Bitcoin orders, and their competitors do as well, thereby fueling competitive discounted pricing.  Let's stop asking for things, and instead improve the Bitcoin payment system to the point that merchants are compelled to offer discounts due to competition.

China's markets have certainly decoupled recently from the US markets.  The spread between Bitfinex and Huobi has gone from ~0% one month ago to over 3% today.  The spread peaked around the 17th of October when it was 8% for a short while.  
This can't be explained just by people using BTC to move money out of China, because that has been possible for the past 2 years+.  There would need to be a massive shift in the capital flight from china using BTC in the last month for this to make sense.  
Another possible reason for the Chinese BTC pump lately could be their weak stock market performance.  The SHCOMP:IND got beat up this summer, and there aren't many options for Chinese investors to store their wealth.  It could be that BTC gained traction as people are less trusting in their stock market.
It could be that this ruling has been hyped up within the Chinese BTC community as well, although the release only hit the press on October 13th.  We notice the spread between China and US markets was relatively for the 2 days after 13th of October.  Instead, the spread has a huge spike on October 16th, reaching a climax on October 17th.  
I'd be nervous about the Chinese government discussing Bitcoin at all.  Bitcoin really goes against all of the capital controls in place in the country.  Any official stance by the government will not be friendly to Bitcoin.  It seriously undermines the Chinese systems that restrict money entering and leaving the country.  
There is no way China will officially endorse Bitcoin.

The value of a monetary instrument is entirely based on trust.  You must trust that its value will be similar tomorrow as it is today.  Once that trust deteriorates, the value does too.  If you seriously attack the Bitcoin network, it will destroy the trust in the value of its currency.  If people are worried that their Bitcoins are going to be worth 10% tomorrow due to government attacks, they'll find a safer place for their money and won't come back.

This is how China news breaks.  It happened last week just the same way.  It began with a few isolated (but reputable) sources, and was followed by an official statement from the Chinese government.  Keep in mind, these decisions are being made quickly and privately.  The fact that someone was able to break this story before the official announcement is extremely valuable news to many people involved in Bitcoin.
If you prefer to leave your ear plugs in, and your blindfold on, to any negative news, so be it.  Nobody gave a shit about the Chase bank thing.  That had nothing to do wit the price dropping.  Nor was it particularly important news.  People get their bank accounts closed all the time for various reasons.  Usually any use of a personal account for high-volume business transactions is enough to get the boot.  Once again, nothing new on this front.
This is all about China.  And you're here whining because it's not sourced directly from the government.  If you truly believe that this information is not reliable, then put your money where your mouth is.  Go buy some more bitcoins, since if what you're saying is correct, they are underpriced.

"Our fair value analysis suggests that to justify the current Bitcoin valuation, it will need to (1) account for at least 10% of all global e-commerce B2C transactions, (2) become one of the top three players in the money transfer industry, and (3) acquire a store of value reputation close to silver."
Bitcoin does not come close to achieving any of these 3 goals.  
1) Bitcoin accounts for very little real B2C e-commerce.  Ignore the inflated values you have seen from Bitcoin supporters.  None of these retailers accept Bitcoins:
- Walmart
- Best Buy
- Amazon
etc. etc.  Name me the biggest company which accepts bitcoin online.  I'd estimate bitcoin makes up ~0.1% of B2C transactions online.  The majority of BTC transactions are to and from exchanges.  These numbers are often included in volume calculations.
2) Top three?  The top two are clearly Visa and Mastercard.  Then we have a massive gap, then we have Paypal.  Paypal is extremely useful for B2C transactions.  You can pay for something within 5 minutes without ever having used Paypal in your life.  If you were trying to buy something for bitcoins, and had never used them before, you'd be looking at 24-72 hours, minimum.  There is no obvious answer at the moment to improve on this.
3) Bitcoin has nowhere near the reputation of metals.  Bitcoin is known to be incredibly volatile, and unlike silver has no underlying value.  It's the wild west.  Wallets get hacked, exchanges stop paying out, you didn't spend 10 hours setting up your wallet to protect against thieves / technical malfunction.
If these are truly the areas bitcoin derives value, then we may as well throw in the towel now.  None of these attributes are within 2-3 years reach.  Most are 5 years+ out, if everything goes right.  Let me tell how Bitcoin currently derives value:
- Scarcity, speculation, buzz
- Money moving
- Genius payment system at its roots
So yes, the ideas behind bitcoin are great.  That much we can all agree upon.  But the fact is, the utility derived from bitcoin is moving money around.  China is a great example; with bitcoin you can move millions of yuan from your Chinese bank to your foreign bank.  That's not something easily accomplished in China.  Not surprisingly, the value has soared based on huge volumes on Btc China.
The genius of bitcoin does not translate well to e-commerce at the moment.  Let's face it.  Transactions take hours to confirm, accounts take days to fund, and the value is based on speculation and uncertainty.

For the Bitcoin argument to work, you need to believe the current financial system is broken.  Many of us here would say that it is.  The government, however, sees it completely the opposite.  They have designed this system for control.  Bitcoin comes in and removes a degree of control.  I just don't see them willing to give up power so that people can save $3 on ATM fees.

There's an easy solution on Paypal.  Just write that the transaction was for virtual items.  This means the buyer waives his rights to buyer protection.

Bitcoin has more utility to China than any other country in the world.  When you combine the fact that the country is very highly connected to the internet, massive currency controls, and ~7 Trillion GDP, it's the perfect storm.  Getting money in and out of the country is a hard thing to do, and Bitcoin made it incredibly easy.
India has the same need for Bitcoin as any other third world country.  Indonesia, Philippines, etc.  It's all really the same.  China was unique.  You can bring Rupiah out of India.  You can bring USD into India. In China, for any larger amounts, you cannot. 
Bitcoin really does not facilitate person-to-person money transfer with the infrastructure in place.  It's years away.

QuickPay payments are not equivalent to confirmed wire transfers.  They are open to fraud.  Someone who hacks a Chase bank account can easily send out QuickPay payments.  
Paypal lets these kinds of things go (after reversing the charges), but banks take it much more seriously.  These fraudulent transactions use up a lot of time and resources for the banks.  I assume you did almost nothing to confirm your customers' identities and just assumed QuickPay would be fraud free.  That's your mistake as a merchant.  You're selling high-value virtual items, you should be taking huge precautions to avoid fraud.
The bank will close your account, and the lesson you can learn from this is to take more responsibility for your transactions.  Any customer who is able to fraud you has outsmarted you, and nobody else.  Do not rely on payment service providers to do your dirty work.  These statements might sound critical, but in this industry, you are on an island alone in protecting yourself from fraud.  No one has any sympathy for merchants of virtual products.  The sooner you take responsibility for these situations, the more successful you will be.

Hey, as much as you sheep like to think the news is fake, it isn't.  You're the ones who need to be kept in check.  Posting threads like this, calling the China news "attempted market manipulation" is the definition of market manipulation.
These are real policies, anyone who uses BTC China / OKCoin can see for themselves.  There has already been a big change in how these exchanges are processing payments since the announcement.  Several third party processors have immediately dropped service, despite being given a deadline of ~Jan 31.
Bitcoin prices have been following real information.  If this was all incorrect, China would have capitalized heavily on the false information and unfounded drop in prices.  However, you'll notice that their exchanges (for the first time in a long time) are by far the cheapest right now.

Actually, you're horribly wrong.  China was by far the most promising market for Bitcoin, and the adoption rate was outpacing anywhere else in the world by a mile.  China telecom was in the process of accepting Bitcoin when this was announced.  They have 160 million subscribers.  This was by far the biggest company in the world which accepted Bitcoin. (SOURCE = 
In China, domestic currency is basically useless outside the country, and foreign currency is basically useless within the country.  There are hard caps on how much you can exchange in a given year as a Chinese citizen, and on a given day for a foreigner.  Bitcoin temporarily allowed these currency controls to be bypassed.
China NEEDS Bitcoin way more than the USA needs Bitcoin.  The fact that the government has come in and imposed restrictions on crypto-currency should come as no surprise, but it's still very unfortunate.  If this were not the case, China would have led the way in Bitcoin innovation and adoption.

"The Notice requires, the Bitcoin websites that act as the main trading platform, should follow the Telecommunications Act and the Regulation on Internet Information Service, and register according to law. Also, because Bitcoin has a higher money laundering risk and the risk of being used by criminals, the Notice requires the relevant organizations to comply with the Anti-Money Laundering Act and fully comply with the legally required anti-money laundering procedures like KYC and suspicious transaction reporting, to prevent Bitocin related money laundering risks."
This paragraph means that exchanges are permitted to continue operating, so long as they operate within the law.  I believe that they were expected to operate within the law before this press release as well.  
Some are wondering if banks are no longer permitted to provide service to exchanges.  However, by allowing exchanges to continue operation, I believe it is obvious that this extends to banks continuing business with the exchanges.  How could a Chinese exchange function without a Chinese bank?  
China is not like the rest of the world.  You can't look for a Bitstamp-style exchange where it is hosted in another country.  The currency controls in China mean that any RMB-based business must be running within country lines.  To allow an RMB-BTC exchange to continue without access to RMB banking would be equivalent to the government scamming its own citizens.
Although I believe there are other interests involved in this press release, one pressing concern for the government is that people are taking high risks trading in virtual currencies.  The risk is not just in the changing exchange rate between RMB and BTC, but also the companies operating bitcoin-related business and storage.  This is accentuated by the fact that just yesterday it was reported that the scammers who ran the Chinese Bitcoin Exchange - GBL - were arrested (source:

Yes, China has OK'ed using exchanges to buy/sell BTC.  As in, they have not made trading bitcoin illegal in the country.  So that's decent news, it certainly could be worse.
However, this all nicely skims over the negative aspects of this announcement.  Many changes have already taken place:
- **Verification @ Exchanges:** Up until 2 days ago, nobody had to prove their identity beyond confirming a mobile phone on BTC China.  Today, all trades require you to be ID verified.  Yes, most exchanges in the world require this today, however, these exchanges did not.  Certainly, by requiring identity verification, black/gray markets which operated through China will be impacted.
China was using Bitcoin to get money into and out of the country with no government intervention.  You can be sure that with the new changes to the exchange systems, that governments will be able to keep a close eye on transactions, and prevent the bypassing of currency controls.
- **B2C Transactions:** When China said bitcoins are not currency, they also meant that products can not be legally sold for bitcoins.  Major retailers which were just beginning to accept BTC in China have now completely separated themselves from it.  China was by far the leader in bitcoin B2C commerce, and they are now at the very bottom.
- **Likelihood of Further Regulation:** From the Chinese announcement, we can see what the government thinks of bitcoin.  They will take any necessary steps to keep their currency controls intact.  If bitcoin becomes a threat, they'll take further measures to squash it.

The LR bust was simply a premonition for the future of these types of payment systems.  Why was LR shut down?
- People could use it to easily launder money (BITCOIN TOO!)
- People used it to buy/sell contraband (REMIND YOU OF ANYTHING!)
- TERRORISM
Really, the only difference is that Bitcoin itself is decentralized.  But everyone knows that deep down, that doesn't make it safe.  If the US wanted to it could destroy BTC overnight.  Take down the major exchanges and the confidence disappears: no one wants BTC.  You people need to remember how fragile this system really is at the end of the day.  No one thought LR was going anywhere, until it did.
I am not saying any of this is a good thing, but I've been through this shit many times.  e-Gold, e-Bullion, LR.  I have balances on all three.  And I have a balance on Bitcoin.  But at this point I know very well the risks involved in having it.  The US government is not cool with any of these types of payment systems.

The China situation has been changing day-to-day.  Up until last night (American time), deposits worked fine on BTCChina / OKCoin.  The day before, the exchanges switched payment processors from Tenpay to Yeepay, and signaled that this was the fix to the problem.  A week before that, the PBOC published a statement which was extremely vague and certainly did not explicitly ban third party processors.

Huobi being shut down means that the personal bank card deposit method that people in China are using to bypass the third party processor ban will be shut down as well.  It will be much more difficult to get money into Bitcoin for China.
@_date: 2013-12-20 17:27:59
The exchanges still running deposits will be shut down soon.  They are having people send money directly to the exchange operators' bank cards.  It's an extremely manual process.  Deposits take 6-12 hours to appear.  When third party payment processors were on board, deposits were instant.
They're just trying to earn whatever they can on the way out.  The government hasn't specifically told them not to accept deposits via bank card, so they are doing so.  But rest assured, there is no way this is sustainable for long.  If anything, it shows the exchanges are looking to maximize short term gain at the expense of long-term viability.

If you're going to be selling 7.8 Bitcoins to someone, and they are going to use an online payment method, you need to ask for a picture of their photo ID.  Then you should take the next step and get a second picture of them holding that same ID up to the camera, with their face visible, and a piece of paper in their hand confirming they are buying from you.
It's not 100% foolproof, but it gives you a ton more evidence in these types of situations.  Personally, I would not accept $5000 USD via bank transfer regardless, but that's just me.

Fair play, the confirmation times may not be a critical problem with the system.  However, let's also not go as far as to say they are meaningless.  If I want to send money which I have on an exchange to my wallet, I must wait for it to confirm.  If I want to spend money sent to me from another user, I must wait for it to confirm.  If I want to sell BTC on an exchange, I must wait for it to confirm (to their standard, usually at least 3 confirmations).
Furthermore, for transactions to confirm quickly, a fee is absolutely necessary.  If I send a payment without a fee, it can literally be stuck for days.  It's happened to me.  For a new user, it would be extremely unnerving to have your money in limbo.   
Many wallets force certain fees upon users.  The fact is, I consider myself quite educated on Bitcoin, and I still find these things confusing at times.  I have no idea what fee I should be paying on transactions.  Does a higher fee = a quicker confirmation?  There may be ways to circumvent the hassle of confirmation times, but for even the above-average user they still play a role in bitcoin trading/transacting.

If Bitcoin ever became equivalent to fiat, whereas it was so liquid that no exchanges would be needed, it would be after a huge wave of regulation.  Walmart and Amazon aren't going to accept Bitcoin until it satisfies the requirements of the financial industry.  Until then, Bitcoin will never be adopted by these companies.  
So, in the case you describe, Bitcoin will be completely different than it is today.  It will be a currency controlled by government and with no anonymity.  Which means that Bitcoin has become like every other fiat currency in the world.  If this is the case, why bother using it at all?  There is no shortage of fiat currencies out there.
@_date: 2013-08-06 18:56:09
The government has actively pursued other payment systems which functioned very similarly to Bitcoin.  e-Gold and Liberty Reserve are the obvious examples, and the reason for the shutdown was that people were able to move money around anonymously.
The premise I am making is that the government will work against any sizable system which allows anonymous transmission of wealth.  This characteristic which makes Bitcoin popular is also the reason it will face strong resistance.
The public ledger shows everything and nothing at the same time.  Yes, you can see every transaction ever made, but to associate these transactions with specific people is nearly impossible right now.  
What you are suggesting, for everyone to register their accounts, is a potential solution, but still has many flaws.  Would this be done through a private organization like a bank, or through the government itself?  How would we prevent unregistered users from using the service?  And, if these systems were to be put in place, would the bottom fall out from under the currency?

The article is the same regurgitated stuff you see everywhere:
"For one thing, BTC China CEO Bobby Lee told CoinDesk today that he is trying to work out a deal with a different third-party payment company to reinstate Chinese yuan deposits."
No shit he is, he'd suck seventeen-thousand dicks to find a sustainable payment processor.  What's the point of this statement?  Is there any situation where he wouldn't try to stop his business from shutting down?
“China’s government is generally supportive of bitcoin, but the rapid increase in awareness, price and adoption caught them a little flat-footed and they wanted to take a ‘pause’ while they better understand the landscape, etc.,” one source theorized. “This is somewhat similar to the U.S. Ultimately, the rulings will evolve to be more accommodating.”
China's government has taken more actions against Bitcoin than any other government in the world.
"Still, the currency is trading down 12 percent today and about 36 percent since Friday. The deposits ban is a blow to the bitcoin ecosystem in China and perhaps worldwide, but it’s a not a death knell."
Certainly, I don't think anyone ever implied that it was a death knell.  China is obviously not the only place where Bitcoin is exchanged and used.

Huobi does 2x more volume than MTGOX, Bitstamp and BTC-e combined.  You're a fool if you think China does not matter.  They are the  market for BTC in the world.  
Fundamentals, uniqueness, world changing.  What's the difference here between Bitcoin and Litecoin?  Or any other alt-currency?  By your standards, nothing.  The difference is the fact that way more people use Bitcoin.  And if Bitcoin loses access to China, then not as many people will be using Bitcoin.

Actually, you are completely wrong.  Nearly every RMB that goes into BTC China is added through a third party payment processor at the moment.  Yeepay has already suspended service to BTC China.  They didn't have to terminate their service so quickly, but like other companies in China, they don't want to do ANYTHING that goes against the government.  So they got out immediately.
There is currently no simple way to add funds online directly from your bank to any major exchange in China without using a third party.  From what I understand, once the Chinese new year rolls around, anyone adding RMB to an exchange will need to go in person to their bank to do so.

Yes, this seems to be the problem.  While the people at the head of the bigger businesses move towards regulation and centralization, they undermine the point of the entire project.  Bitcoin is not a replacement to Paypal.  It will never be able to compete with Paypal.  It is not supposed to compete with Paypal.
Bitcoin was created to anonymously / securely transfer wealth without government involvement.  Unfortunately, the system works great at transferring Bitcoins, but provides no solution for trading this to fiat.  And no matter what you use Bitcoins for, you need to be able to cash in/out for fiat.  
I feel we are coming to a brick wall.  While many people seem to be declaring Bitcoin the future of money, no one acknowledges that there is going to be a big trade-off between regulation and anonymity.

I think that the key part of the announcement was that bitcoin is not to be used as currency.  To them, this means that goods / services can not be exchanged for BTC in China.  Likewise, I don't believe you are allowed to list products in denominations of gold or silver either.

As the author mentioned, eBay is not the place to buy / sell Bitcoins.  The system is designed with buyer protection in mind.

There is no simple way to prove that the person who received the Bitcoin was the same person who owns the credit card / Paypal account used for the transaction.

Well, that's true.  To reduce the risk, you can require the following:
- Phone call to the buyer (Reverse Whitepages the phone number, make sure the location matches closely to the shipping info on Paypal.  Avoid buyers outside USA, Canada)
- Have the buyer pay through a website checkout, which records their IP address.  Check the IP address on  and deny any orders made from a proxy / different location than shipping information
Follow those 2 steps and you'll scare away 90% of frauders.  By limiting order sizes to ~$100 per person, you'll also spread your risk more evenly across your orders.
EDIT: I still wouldn't advise selling Bitcoins through Paypal, but I'm just outlining how you'd minimize the risk.
