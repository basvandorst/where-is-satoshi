There's a verification for both. The lead investor is responsible for creating the syndicate, negotiating with founders, and getting information to backers. They lead and the backers invest together.
To answer you question directly, we have a screening process for all investors. So no, it is not possible to buy tokens without being verified manually by Funderbeam.

What's your relation to/interest in bitcoin? and does it make sense for you that it can be used for trading investments?

Hi. I was presenting this.
I did not talk of totals. The point of this graph was to show that interested peaked at different times, blockchain more recently. This is not to say, that there is a total amount of more interest in searches.
I don't think there's competition between these technologies, and I was certainly not trying to "be mean" to bitcoin.
