zerocoin is for anonimity, not security

Nope, I wasn't goxed, yet I still received it.

Damage control.

And how much value do you think it can support with a capability of 3 transactions per second? Why would anyone use such a system?
[This]( is what I signed up for, when I bought/mined my coins in 2011. Now this plan has changed, which is why I cashed out.

He lost over 250 bitcoins

I think it was a joke

The USA government seized money from many people who are not even usa citizens. They are no better than thieves.

No, she doesn't. Stop repeating this Cyprus nonsense, people are not using bitcoin in Cyprus, the search volume is 0, it's 21 in argentina:

different pools charge different fees and some don't share the transaction fees, so the amount is not the same.

This is probably even a good thing for the time being, it will facilitate the hard fork to increase the block size.
@_date: 2013-04-05 13:07:43
The current limit of 7 transactions per second too small (for example Visa can do over 10k tps) and even with a larger block size, miners can still decide, if they want to include transactions with no fees. And also they can simply increase the block size, not make it limitless.

the inflation adjusted graph for gold looks quite a bit different

I wouldn't say he stands for reason and evidence. Look at the treatment of people on his forums, it is very cultish, they ban and bully people with dissenting opinions. He always talks about reasoning with people, but look what happens when an agreement can't be reached, the disagreeing side gets labeled as unreasonable or downright evil and gets outed. 
Look for example at topics concerning free will versus determinism debate. 
People have a whole forum dedicated to his unethical behaviour linked above.
He has also lost over 250 bitcoins in donations because he didn't backup his previous wallet. 
Here's a thread about it:
