And prison and large penalty fees when you inevitably get caught.

If you are looking for a card try crypto.com. They are shipping to the US now and I have both the bitpay and mco Visa card from crypto.com. The mco card is a million times better as well as the app. The card actually has perks and the platform has staking and interest options on your holdings. Pretty much everything about the platform is better than bitpay. I’d at least look into it if you are looking for a card.

It’s a joke lmao whooosh

No problem, I’m sure you’ll love it. The earn function is bonkers. I’ve earned a ton of interest on my bitcoin while I’m holding it

I wouldn’t say 1 mil is an instant retirement anymore and by the time bitcoin hits that if it ever does 1 million won’t be what it is today in terms of purchasing power so it definitely won’t be an instant retirement at that time

Who invests in something with a horizon of 2 years? Lmao, this is why the crypto community is retarded. It’s because people like this invest more than they are willing to lose and want to get rich quick. People should be investing with horizons of 5+ years, people just don’t understand how market cycles work in the long term.

Actually if you bought bitcoin during 88% of its life span you’d been in profit. There’s only a small window of time where If you bought you’d be in a loss. Just be smart and DCA and you make money In this market. Unfortunately most people are not smart. You seem like one of those people

I can’t upvote this enough lmao
@_date: 2019-12-19 05:53:52
The point still applies. Even in the last 2 years if you dca’d you’d be doing real well. In addition if you bought for most of the time the last 2 years outside of like 4-5 months when the price pumped you’d also be up. Stupid investors like to buy when the price has already gone up 100% and then complain why they are in a loss a couple months later during a correction. There were plenty of opportunities to buy bitcoin and make a ton of money in the last 2 years. Even at current prices. Bitcoin was below 5k for months lol

This is so true lol, what gonna happen is it’s not gonna do anything  and people will get salty and sell. Then it’ll pump when those noobs are gone ��
@_date: 2019-12-30 19:35:37
Yes but the masses that will flock to bitcoin when it’s going up don’t understand this. Only the people that are currently buying understand this. So therefore it can’t be priced in totally. Maybe it’s priced in for current speculators but not new investors next year and the year after. This is where that argument fails.

Bro he literally just explained in layman’s terms how fractional reserve banking works and why it can work with any denominable currency whether that be bitcoin or the USD. Don’t be a salty baby.

Blockfolio by far

Yes this is 100% a Scam don’t give this person any info whatsoever. Tell them to go fuck themselves
@_date: 2019-12-30 19:33:00
This is a very reasonable answer. Supply shock can’t be priced in until that shock hits the masses. Basic economics

This guy out here getting hella roasted lmao
@_date: 2019-12-31 03:41:29
I sold all my fortnite skins for btc like a good little boy
@_date: 2019-12-19 21:12:20
Mooner? Lmao I don’t think investing small amounts and being diversified over the last couple years is being a mooner lol buying at the top like you did is what a mooner is lol
@_date: 2019-12-03 21:12:12
I am invested and have been since 2017 dollar cost averaging into bitcoin every paycheck. But posts like this are really dumb. Just because the market has been correcting as of recent doesn’t mean it’s dead lmao
@_date: 2019-12-26 00:10:53
100% this, there is so much manipulation of idiots that can’t think for themselves lol
@_date: 2019-12-30 19:31:54
This is the correct answer. Anyone saying it’s public knowledge knows that it’s truly not because most of the “public” doesn’t understand bitcoin, they just know it exists. The halvening is already priced in with the people that are currently buying not All new potential investors that will buy because it’s going up.

@_date: 2019-12-01 22:37:40
Boom. Explained. These guys out here getting roasted hard lol
@_date: 2019-12-30 19:24:50
It’s still doubled even at current levels. Every asset that goes parabolic will also have steep corrections. Just don’t buy when it’s going parabolic it’s simple.
@_date: 2019-12-19 18:41:54
I’ve literally dca’d the last 2 years and I’m doing real well lmao. Sounds like you just bought the top because you don’t know what you’re doing...
