Considering mobile phones as an example, mine is more like 90% of capacity. This is taking into account that I charge it once per day and usually its below 20% by the evening. Battery is the factor that limits capacity when it comes to mobile devices and it is already too limiting to realise anything close to a 1000% more bandwidth for a mesh network.

I was born here, I will go wherever freedom, privacy and quality of life are accessible. Right now I still count the UK, but my government is making a very good case to drive me away. Loosing skilled productive members of the society stands to destroy this county.

* Which data decryption laws?
I think the queen is a nice and harmless national institution that represents our digerati. And she is the head of the protestant church (not that that makes a difference to me).

In other words, a bubble.

Think it through, in this situation there would be more demand for Bitcoin so the price would rise compared to the fiat. Adding more fiat to supply would decrease how much that is worth. You would see some combination of a rise in Bitcoin buying power and drop in fiat buying power.

What about all the USD terror funding?

I defined R as transaction rate, the rate of transactions, the amount of transactions in seconds. I could choose to measure this in mega-transactions per microsecond, or pico-transactions per year, for example.

You should be using a different address for each transaction really, right?

What are some good alternative Exchanges that deal in £ (GBP)?

I kinda meant legal goods and services, although this is a point.

The logo of the affected site isn't on any other US takedown notices. Seems fishy to me. Perhaps DPR took the bitcoin for themselves.

Quite, and I was just reasoning toward the latter part, the fact that a linear growth in transaction rate would indicate a quadratic growth in block chain size. I should have started where you finished and worked backwards to go from first principles.

This made my day.

I think you're wrong. The rate of growth of the block chain is proportional the rate of transactions. Therefore the rate of growth of transactions is proportional to the rate of the rate of growth of the block chain.
In other terms, block chain size = B, Transaction rate = R
    R ∝ (d/dt)B
    and
    (d/dt)R ∝ (d2/dt2)B
so if R grows linearly, (d/dt)R = constant (say 2C), hence
    (d2/dt2)B = c
    B= ct^2 + at + b
which is quadratic in nature.
