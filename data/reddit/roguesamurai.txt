Nothing is more important than children, the best thing for your child is you and your wife together -- but if you got a divorce and your wife used half the money to raise your child it would be money well spent, and better to be single with a million bucks than in a bad marriage with 2 million!
Flip half of your coins to cash and go see a retirement adviser. You should both quit your jobs, find a cheap house with some land in a beautiful place, maybe the mountains. Have freaky sex with your wife, sleep late, have a big breakfast every morning. Take your kid fishing, hiking, teach them about computers. Hug them every day. Maybe have some more kids. Don't take shit from anyone, always be honest because you can afford to alienate people who can't handle the truth. One day, many decades from now, have a massive stroke in your sleep and slip away to the next beautiful dream where you can start over and do it all again even better the next time.

I heard Jeff Berwick on a podcast reference the Jan 9, 1988 cover of the economist which predicts the emergence of a world currency in 2018. He suggested that bitcoin might unintentionally fill that role. The economist is owned by the Rothschilds, a very old banking family who have been guilty of influencing history in malicious ways -- they are the dictionary definition of the 1%, the inventors of central banking, the problem cryptocurrencies were created to solve.
I'm a big believer in bitcoin, so I can't imagine that anything other than benevolent genius is behind it, but it's pretty wild that The Economist would peg the date 30 years in advance. Though I guess there is nothing special yet (!) about 2018 other than bitcoin's meteoric rise throughout 2017 and a lot of potential upside left to go.
