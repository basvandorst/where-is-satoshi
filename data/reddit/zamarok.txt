You sure? ;) I have +20% overdrive, and I use Afterburner to OC. I'm getting 430 MHash/s at 1000 mhz right now (turned it up a bit), and I couldn't do that without overdrive. You have to use Afterburner to set your clocks first, *then* turn overdrive up. Oh, and underclock your RAM to 400, if you haven't. That seems to be the perfect number for me anyway.

How do I know that the picture is worth that?

Everyone knows that 99% just means "most"

Because there are no bitcoins, there is a bitcoin balance. Let me explain: imagine I subtract one from my five, and add it to your three. Now we both have four. That is the end of the transaction. You don't have multiple bitcoins, you have a number that represents your bitcoin balance. There is a difference between (1+1+1) and 3, and your bitcoin balance is represented by the latter.
This was done on purpose, because something that is just a balance is infinitely divisible in theory. In practice, computers have limits to the accuracy of decimal precision, so at this time bitcoins can be divided until the pieces are something like 8 decimal places small. US dollars, however, are indivisible; you cannot break your dollar into smaller pieces. You can *trade* dollars for pennies that represent a unit in only the second decimal place, but you can't really divide a dollar. That difference may sound like semantics, but it is an important difference as you can see. See why they designed bitcoins this way now?

Dude you just made like $380.

Less bitcoins, but the increased difficulty means they're worth more. All in all, this increased difficulty makes your MHash/s earn less bitcoins, but more USD.

Spend some time reading up about compiling programs. No ones gonna walk you through it here, sad to say. You're probably going to get some RTFM posts lol

Wow, this is exactly how my uncle explained it to me. It's exactly what happened during the [Dutch Tulip Craze]( Same situation really... bitcoins aren't really being *used*, not enough to matter anyway. They're mostly being bought and sold with then intention of greater profit later, or pulling out now.

'Making' a buck implies that you earned it. 'Stealing' a buck is how I would describe the hacker's actions.

I don't understand why you didn't post the picture with this comment.

Probably some sysadmin, someone with the power to restart the VM.

Maybe Tycho knows where Bitcoin's real profit lies lol.. hmmm

Bitcoins were designed to be transferred without being able to trace specific coins. Sure, the blockexplorer shows transactions, but it doesn't show where specific coins go. For instance, it is easy to see how many coins were sent to an address, but you can't tell which coins were sent. If an address recieves coins, and decides to send them back, there is no way to tell if the original coins are being sent back or not, because coins aren't actually individual objects to the bitcoin network; your bitcoin balance is just a number, not a collection of individual coins. Imagine a cup of water . . . you can put drops in, and you can take drops out, but you can't really tell which drops are which. It's a cup of water, not a cup of water drops.
The bitcoin network was designed to imitate cash transactions, and it was designed this way on purpose.

Try turning AMD Overdrive to +20%. I remember I was right at about 340 before I did that.
@_date: 2011-06-06 03:55:10
Mine did that at first, but I did a lot of tweaking and it stopped at some point along the line. I got CCC 11.5. Did you configure your afterburner settings to look like this?
    [ATIADLHAL]
    EnableUnofficialOverclocking	= 1
    UnofficialOverclockingEULA	= I confirm that I am aware of unofficial overclocking limitations and fully understand that MSI will not provide me any support on it
    UnofficialOverclockingMode	= 2
    AccessibilityCheckingPeriod	= 0

I have a Sapphire reference card... maybe those can do it better? idk, I'm all out of ideas. Good luck.. that 20% boost turns into almost +20% bitcoin generation.
@_date: 2011-06-05 17:32:11
Only 290 Mhash? I get 400 on mine, same card.. are you overclocking it?
@_date: 2011-06-15 23:56:20
This is like a really good mystery novel.
@_date: 2011-06-06 04:49:26
My CCC looks the same way too by the way. When I boot up, I set my clocks via MSI, then give CCC a boost. I usually tweak my clocks a bit, cause I'm still trying to find that sweet-spot overclock. I often have to reapply overdrive because changing the clocks in afterburner resets it. Sometimes a bit later CCC will glitch out like in your screenshot, but overdrive is already boosted at this point.
CCC starts up first, and then I run MSI. Maybe you have to launch the programs in that order?
