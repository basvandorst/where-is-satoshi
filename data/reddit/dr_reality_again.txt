Not really.  Have  Wall Street, major corporations and financial entities- even supported or had connections with things that failed?   As long as there is money to be made, you can expect all sorts to jump in, especially when it's suckers at the other end.  That,however, does not ensure longevity.
@_date: 2019-12-15 21:19:22
People here lie to themselves all the time, about how what matters is that bitcoin is permissionless, censorship resistance, etc.   In reality what people really want is the large amount of money they hope to make from bitcoin (by hodling it and later selling it to others).  Once you understand that, your frustrations will go away.   
In the meantime you can be your own bank while complaining about banks stopping you from doing this or that, you can cut out the middleman while relying on exchanges, you can yell about how useless fiat is while taking it for your labour and using it to pay for useful goods and services, etc.   :-)

@_date: 2019-12-16 05:55:20


If you say so, buddy.  But in the meantime everyone is dying to get their hands on more of it and (to a lesser extent) other forms of "useless, filthy fiat".   Bitcoin means diddly squat to 99.99999999% of the people of this planet. 
Hope?  Of course.  Nothing like hope to keep the world turning for some people.

In the meantime, even you, with all your bitcoin must work for filthy, useless fiat and use it to pay for good s and services that you need; rely on banks; obey the police as they enforce the law; etc.   What a bad world!

Read again what I wrote. Slowly.
After every halvening? I wouldn't extrapolate too much from just two data points.  That's the sort of reasoning that got people so worked up about Chinese New Years.
If people are so sure that the price will skyrocket after the halvening, why are all the smart bitcoiners already buying tonnes of it and driving up the price?  Answer: it is all random speculation.
@_date: 2019-12-16 00:27:25
Not really.   Venezuelans are not in a position to mine bitcoin.   They must pay for it with the "filthy", "useless" fiat.  So, tell me again about how they exit the system.   And there they are actually worse off than people in better run countries: read the Venezuelan chap's post on how one bitcoin is going at around the equivalent $9500 here while it's around $7000 elsewhere.
@_date: 2019-12-18 00:22:45
How are they attacking it?   They have simply stated that they have no use for it, which is quite understandable.  It is silly for people here to keep claiming that bitcoin is overthrowing the legacy system, which supposedly is simply terrible, and at the same time complain that the legacy system will have nothing to do with them.   Be your own bank, cut out the middleman, overthrow Visa and Mastercard!   Etc. Etc. Etc.
@_date: 2019-12-16 10:36:27
I don't agree with all the claims about Bitcoin, but I think you exaggerate a bit.

@_date: 2019-12-15 23:23:29
Sorry, you lost me at the first sentence.   How *exactly* does the existence of bitcoin stop governments from printing money?   
On the second point: say a government simply declares that bitcoin is illegal and cannot be used to make or taken for payment for goods and services, how many people do you think will use it over fiat.  (Not that more than 0.000000001% are now doing so.)
By the way, the state can tax on other bases, not just by directly tracking your money.   In your imaginary, future world in which all (or most people) use bitcoin, simply tax them on the goods and services.   Or is the idea to hodl forever.
@_date: 2019-12-16 00:17:33
I'm sure people in Venezuela are using bitcoin.   How many people are those?   What is the total amount of bitcoin involved in Venezuela?   If bitcoin is the answer, why hasn't already lifted Venezuela out of the mire?
@_date: 2019-12-15 20:59:08
Most people in normally functioning countries have hardly any \*real\* problems with the state, which provides many services in return for taxes.

Too bad I still can't use it as money.   I get paid in "useless" fiat money, and that is what I use to pay for goods and services.   Just like you and everyone else around here.   The only real benefit of Bitcoin is that we can speculate in it, and if we are lucky we can make tonnes of real money.
@_date: 2019-12-15 22:15:43
There are already around 18 millions bitcoins.   How does halving make bitcoin more scarce?
" Whether demand changes is anyones guess, but the halving actually increases demand."
So, we don't know if demand will change, but we know it will increase.  WTF!
@_date: 2019-12-16 09:47:20
I am quite concerned about inflation, having seen the effects of too much of it (hyperinflation) as well as the lack of it (deflation).   And given the criminality of laundering, I am concerned about that too and grateful that  with proper banks we at least have some guards.
Bitcoin has not solved anything, although it has been of some help to those involved in speculation, scams and Ponzis, and assorted criminal activities.

@_date: 2019-12-16 10:30:19
I know the meaning of scarce.   Bitcoin might well be scarce.  But it cannot get *more* scarce if the total amount is always increasing.   See that "more" there, as in your claims.
Regarding supply, check they Cambridge definition for the difference between noun and verb.   That will clarify a lot for you and help you see the lack of sense in your statement that "The original supply is half what it used to be". 
It reviewing your most recent comments, it appears that English if not your first language.  Be careful in using Google Translate to post in an English-language forum.
@_date: 2019-12-16 10:02:08
No, the original supply will not be half what it used to be.   Right now, the supply is around 18 million bitcoins, and mining *increases* the number each day.   Therefore, the supply is increasing.  After the "halving", bitcoin will still be produced each day.   Therefore, the supply will keep increasing.   The only thing that will change is that the supply will not increase as fast as it did before the having.

If you keep a dollar under your bed for 10 years, why would you expect it to be "worth" more than a dollar when you pull it out?

Since Bitcoin has been around for only one decade, I guess it can't be difficult to be the most important out of two.
Lightning is going nowhere.  The idea is that it will make it easy to make small purchases.   But regular people aren't going to go to the trouble of getting BTC, getting and maintaining wallets, etc. just to be able to buy coffee and smokes.   Lightning was a cute idea, but as a practical matter it was dead from the get-go.
" potentially take us to a $1m bitcoin around 2024-25":  pure delusion.
@_date: 2019-12-15 22:28:12
And after a decade there are almost no goods and services that I can buy with bitcoin.  I must still use filthy, useless fiat ... like 99.99999% of the planet.   And governments, banks, and corporations are mostly as they were ten years ago.   But, wait!   This is just like the internet in 1895, and great things are yet to come, right?
@_date: 2019-12-16 01:26:26
And yet people can afford more and better food now (and in 2017) that they could in 1928.   You want to know how?   Let me let you in on a secret: wages are now much higher, and so people have much more money, today than in 1928.
I will help you with a very simple lesson in economics: How long did a person have to work to make $20 in 1928 and how long in 2017?  Or another way: how much of, say, a person's monthly wage did it take to fill that cart in 1929 and how much in 2017?
It's not too late for you.  Even your local community college offers Economics 101 that will help you with basic economic reasoning.  Go get!

No wallets?   And you "simply get" bitcoin into what?  And get it from where?  How many people are going to bother to pay or get paid in bitcoin?
I can certainly imagine 20% of the planet "embracing" bitcoin.  What I can't imagine is why they would actually bother.  Sorry, will never happen.  And, no, the usual stories about the impending collapse of fiat won't change that little hard reality.
@_date: 2019-12-17 04:53:40
The correct phrase is "couldn't care less".   If you could care less, then you should.
@_date: 2019-12-16 10:52:05
Look, the only people that will embrace bitcoin are speculators (me and most people here) and people who are into legally questionable activities.   That's never going to be more than a handful of people globally or even just in any one country.
@_date: 2019-12-15 23:03:33
And how is Bitcoin doing so far with all that?
@_date: 2019-12-17 05:18:52
Obviously, most people have no use for your "good word", just as they have no use for bitcoin.  So, why don't **you** stop being a schmuck and quit bothering them.
@_date: 2019-12-16 00:09:32
No need to bother with all those "good" books.   Just look around you.   Where and how many people do you see using or taking bitcoin for goods and services?  
Nobody is transitioning and leaving the legacy system, my friend.  Even all the dreamers here go to work for filthy and useless fiat, use that to  pay for goods and services, use banks and their services, etc.
There are already places with much political unrest.   How is bitcoin doing there?   How much bitcoin do all those places account for.  The reality, my friend, is that most bitcoin is in the hands of people who live in stable countries and have the disposable income to invest in speculative commodities.   The notion that bitcoin has any worthwhile use in places of political unrest, except for the already rich who want to squirrel out their wealth, or that it is of any use to the world's poor is the height of absurdity.
@_date: 2019-12-16 10:59:35
Well, the current supply is around 18 million bitcoins.  And more are mined each day. (Note, RE "supply": noun, not the verb, as in your Cambridge foray.)  The halvening does not cut the supply by half; it cuts the *rate of increase*  in the supply.   
That was your free lesson for today.
@_date: 2019-12-15 21:35:38
The only reason people are hoarding (hodling) bitcoin is that they hope to made "mad gains" by later selling to others.   That is why people here are constantly worked up about the price of bitcoin in terms of real money.

Yes, better than Paypal.  Until you try to change that BTC into real money in your bank account.

After that mad rush of institutional investors, we will now have a mad rush of billionaires.   Definitely good for bitcoin!   On the other hand, there is another Chinese New Year coming soon.   But not to worry, the Wall Street bonuses and Bakkt/Starbucks (yuuuuuuge) will more than make up for it.

The situation in Venezuela is the result of economic mismanagement, and the hyperinflation is just a symptom of that.   Therefore, contrary to the delusions of many (with no understanding of economics), the use of bitcoin will not help, as it does not solve any economic problems.  That is why, beyond a few "some people are surviving on bitcoin" stories, Venezuela will remain a gloomy place, even with all the bitcoin there is around.
@_date: 2019-12-16 00:24:10

@_date: 2019-12-15 21:43:49
Yes, prices go up over time.   But so do wages, my friend.  The reality is that in any well run country, people can afford more and better things over time even as prices go up.  That is why living standards are much higher than, say, a 100 or 50 years ago.
@_date: 2019-12-15 23:02:46
Nothing like 99% of Americans are living like shit, my friend.  And even if they were, how would bitcoin help them?  
Contrary to what many think, bitcoin does not really create wealth; it simply transfers it from those who buy a speculative asset at prices higher than the sellers paid for it.   Nor does bitcoin do away with banks and other "nasty" middlemen, which is why people here are always complaining about bank transfers, exchanges.   
Bitcoin actually solves no real problem.   But it is good for one thing, which is why I am into it: with proper timing I can make some more of that filthy, useless fiat, which I then use to pay for all sorts of luxuries (i.e.not necessities).
@_date: 2019-12-16 06:57:44

If you believe bitcoin is helping with all that, then you live in an imaginary world.   Besides, many of the problems you mention, while they exist in some countries, are a matter of governance; bitcoin cannot solve such problems and never will.
@_date: 2019-12-16 09:36:34
Yes, without difficulty, as all the horror stories here about exchanges show.   And is there a fee (direct or indirect, via the "exchange rate"), or do these exchanges do it for free, just to be nice?
By the way, it won't be in your bank on Sunday.   As you note, first the KYC hassles.  Then after that each "selling forever" takes some time.

@_date: 2019-12-16 05:57:59
You didn't do well in grade school math, did you?   As long as more bitcoins are being mined, the supply is increasing.   And if the supply is increasing it can't be getting more scarce.   
Free educational hint: try and distinguish between "supply" and "the rate of increase of supply".    You're welcome!
@_date: 2019-12-16 10:08:15

@_date: 2019-12-16 06:24:51
Even if we assume all that is true, and I'm not saying that it is, what does it have to do with the point you are replying to, i.e,  the simple statement of hard fact most people in properly run countries have no problems with their governments?
Look, bitcoin is good for speculation, for those who are smart enough; they cane make some real money out of it, via the buying and selling.   But to actually believe that bitcoin solves any real problem is simply going a bit too far.
@_date: 2019-12-15 21:48:11

I am talking about the current *reality* .   Living standards have generally improved even as the prices have gone up.  What you should be prices relative to wages and what can be afforded.   For example, what percentage of people can afford to buy Xtoday, even though prices are much higher.

Go all the way to 100%, since bitcoin is going to the moon and fiat money will end up as entirely useless.

They are doing this and that with bolivars?   I thought you said they are exiting the system.
Yes, the demand is high.  But how many people actually have bit coin? How many people are using bitcoin?   More significantly, what is the total amount of bitcoin involved in all of Venezuela?
Look, contrary to your fantasies, bitcoin is not going to solve the problems of economic mismanagement.  And the fact that a few, i.e. the relatively rich!, can lay their hands on bitcoin amounts to nothing for the country as a whole.

OK.  Tell me the benefits of bitcoin's solution to the  "byzantine generals problem".   And, no, telling me about another problem won't do.

No, buddy.  You need to do your homework.   For example, check out the history of non-government money in the USA.  
By the way, bitcoin is not money.   It is a speculative commodity and a tool for assorted criminality.  Regular people have absolutely no use for it, so "can't control" and "doesn't inflate" are of little practical value.

What is he (and you) bitching about?  No middlemen, right?   Good, the middleman are telling him to piss off.  Seems balanced, I'm sure you will agree.   
If you and your friend want to deal with "plastic" middlemen, then the first thing that has to go is the "bitcoin means no middlemen" and suchlike nonsense.   I hope he is learning quick.

A real kicker, eh?  If you say so, friend.  But food for what kind of thought?
@_date: 2019-12-16 00:22:24
Yes.   Hyperinflation is the result of economic mismanagement.  With sufficient time, even Venezuela will improve on that front.   Bitcoin has nothing to do with that.

They do?   What an effective way of cutting out the middleman and being your own bank!

You certainly may consider it theft, but nobody cares about that as long as you are sure to pay your taxes. Otherwise, know that tax evasion is a serious crime.
