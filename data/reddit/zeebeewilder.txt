Fair point about market cap, yet I believe the analyst is referring to USD price value and not comparing the market value (capitalization) of these two commodities.

there are 1000s of developers who contribute to Core, of which a handful have commit rights to the source code. These also happen to be the ones who engage in patient rhetoric about the inflamed issue of blocksize.
The way the Open Source development model works is that anyone is free to comment on proposed code changes and to submit code changes themselves. So, if a developer has a contribution to make they simply make a pull request. Why should developers have to talk about vision and consensus actions? They're just following the line of march as established by... consensus.
Its a kingdom of Doing, not Yapping.

its not "fun" its a serious problem in the community. Bitcoin Judas is well-funded, influential and he's capitalizing on negative sentiment and lumpen elements to fuel his damaging populist campaign, based on pretzel logic about infrastructure scaling.
is free to contribute facts and opinions regardless of ajwest's disappointment and self-assumed policing.

careful who you call smart. Those were two morons that held up Core development for years. Hearn's code work is mediocre by anyone's standard and Gavin couldn't solve the basic organisational challenges Satoshi tasked him with - to the point where Satoshi had to publicly rebuke him for populism instead of consensus operations.
Call a fool clever and you look dumb.

Fair point about there only being 100s of devs contributing to Core over the last few months. Certainly there are thousands of devs who use Core as a code base in computer science labs around the world, for business applications and for hobby and experimentation.
My point is that, given the development model, if you would like to add your opinion to consensus, then your only realistic option is to become active in the project by proposing changes (via BIP) and by making code contributions. 
Vision is articulated in BIPs and research papers and the viability of a vision is demonstrated in simulation and observational experiment. Its action through science that drives Core development along the original vision set out in the whitepaper, right?

Any chance he brings that same set of attitudes and behavior to Bitcoin? I mean the carelessness, short-sightedness and willingness to risk other peoples' lives/money...
