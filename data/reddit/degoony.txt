Brian Armstrong has a personal agenda against BTC.  That’s why they launched Bcash the way they did, that’s why he admits to owning more ETH than BTC, and that is why he prioritized launching Bcash over implementing Segwit and batching transactions.

Anyone useing Trezor can batch transactions easily.  Just click "add recipients" on the bottom right corner when sending.  Easy peasy. 
Now why can't Coinbase F*CKING do this for its customers?
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:29:59
Hmmm.. then how will the network be secured?
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:23:10
Definitely transfer to segwit trezor address.  You'll save on transaction fees.

Someone just sent him 37 BTC! (he deserves it).
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:20:49
why does it still say unconfirmed transaction?
Hope it went through.  I agree.  He deserves it!
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:34:20
Yes you're right..  think he allocated 5% initially.  Didn't mean to be misleading.

Try using ABRA once they ramp up this year.

I agree with that as well.  I've had recurring of delays/issues with coinbase.  I tried out Gemini and have not had any issues. Frankly, their platform seems to be geared more towards institutional clients. 
I strongly suggest giving Gemini a try.  You may never use coinbase again!

No that's incorrect.  You can go to any number of wallets and use your recovery seed.  Your seed will work with your wallet that is recorded ON the blockchain.  It has nothing to do with the wallet you chose when you originally created your public/private keys. 
@_date: 2017-01-19 01:58:07
Even using those numbers it's just a 2% transaction fee ($40/$20000).  Western Union is multiples of that.  I'm sure you've pay higher fees for using ATM not owned by your bank.

It's a bit complicated but the service is simply providing a way for you to store your fiat currency as bitcoin on your phone.  The diagram is basically a way for them to hedge the price of bitcoin vs the fiat currency you use.
The key point is that end users won't even know they hold bitcoin and are using bitcoin to send money to anyone or any country, withdraw cash, or deposit cash in any of the 50 countries they will be launching in next month (and in those currencies).
This would spread the actual use of bitcoin worldwide without people even realizing it.  That's the point!

There will still be bots trading and arbitraging relatively small price movements and price discrepancies among exchanges.  However, those traders need a wider spread to be profitable with the change.  I think it's a great thing fundamentally for the btc market overall, mostly due to the removal of all that leverage.  I think the fees aren't such a big deal. 
@_date: 2017-01-04 19:43:57
Good thing or bad thing?  Hopefully not a hack.  On the flip side, if it were a hack..  that would give us another buying opportunity ;)  Guessing it's just overwhelming traffic.

Use Gemini instead!  I too am waiting for 7 btc to settle. Also, one of my USD deposits was cancelled by Coinbase for no reason, while another USD deposit remains outstanding for over a week now. 
Meanwhile you can buy $500 worth of bitcoin instantly with "instant ACH" at Genesis with much lower fees than Coinbase.

Fantastic post. Thanks you. Exactly what I was looking for.
@_date: 2016-12-27 02:03:22
What about the local exchanges themselves? I believe there are a couple in India that have seen huge gains in volume?  Or is that BS as well?  I honestly don't know and am only throwing it out there.

It's protection for IF your recovery seed is compromised.  Let's say someone found your recovery seed written down and hidden under your mattress.  They can sweep your wallet right?  Passphrase protects against that.
@_date: 2019-06-10 06:37:07
You’re telling me that if I picked a 50 character pass phrase an attacker would be able to break that in a few days?  How can that be?  That’s as much entropy as the seed itself is it not?
@_date: 2019-06-10 04:55:12
You misunderstand me.  The seed phrase will be generated by a hardware wallet.  I’m talking about the pass phrase. The extra words in addition to your recovery seed.
@_date: 2019-10-04 04:06:43
I have both.  Trezor is much much better, especially the model T.  Ledger is a pain in the arse to use compared to the trezors.  Also, you don’t need to download and install desktop software for the trezors while you do for ledgers.
@_date: 2019-06-10 02:07:09
Thanks for your thoughtful response.  Yes I've been reading a lot about how to generate entropy, what adds to and reduces it.
Another thought is to do what Casa is doing.  Restore a wallet onto say 3 trezors.  Store each in a safe (but different) place with a good PIN and passphrase.  No need to write down a recovery seed.  Any of the three trezors alone can be used to access your wallet.  However, if one is stolen, the PIN provides the first layer of defense while the passphrase provides another.  Is that a safer setup altogether?
@_date: 2019-10-03 03:22:43
i'm using a casa node.... that's running lnd right?  how do I "loop in"?  any instructions you can point me to?
@_date: 2019-06-11 21:53:07
Wow thanks for such a thorough reply. Will check out all of those links.

where is this gif from?

Coinmetrics just answered my question!
Fees would work out to about 0.5% of transaction value today if you were to do away with mining rewards.  
@_date: 2017-04-22 22:49:59
19 times (not %).  I never thought about it, but to Andreas' point, if mining profit margins are 1% then a 20% efficiency increase = 19x profit increase. 
So if you spent $1 million in electricity cost then your profit margin went from $10,000 to $190,000.
@_date: 2019-01-27 23:33:27
Thx...  I’ll take a look
@_date: 2019-01-27 15:13:17
Ahh that’s an interesting way to think about it, thanks.  So said differently, if the nominal value of total transactions per block increases enough, fees can rise as well but keep the ratio of fees as a % of tx value reasonable?
@_date: 2018-02-10 21:58:39
Sorry I meant to attach a pic but it didn't upload for some reason...  you can compare here...
@_date: 2018-02-10 23:09:07
That's fair...  I guess whichever chain has the widest adoption is the most relevant.. regardless of the name.
It's great to see BTC scaling for the long-term with second layer network development while at the same time managing neat term network congestion through Segitw+Batching.
@_date: 2018-02-10 22:06:35
That's a great point!!!  Didn't think of that.  
@_date: 2017-10-14 07:15:00
They are working on second layer transactions which will have negligible fees and near immediate confirmation times.  That’s how you buy a cup of coffee or tip someone $0.02 for their website with negligible frictional costs.
How will big blockers accomplish that?
@_date: 2017-10-13 07:47:42
I’m not sure I follow your comment.  It’s business strategy that won, not the tech.
@_date: 2017-06-01 17:39:34
That is not an ETF.  It is an ETN (Exchange Traded Note).  It's designed to provide the underlying exposure of BTC but there are nuances to it.  It's technically a debt instrument issued by a bank where they swap the returns of BTC to the ETN holder.  So you pay a small fixed interest rate, and you receive the gains or losses of bitcoin in exchange (just like an interest rate swap).
It's great news, no doubt and it is supposed to act just like an ETF.  But just wanted to point out that nuance.
To the mooon!
