It's absolutely ridiculous that a few individuals can yield so much "worthless" influence in the name of a very powerful project and community. The foundation has reached the end of the road and should either be completely "refurbished" or simply disbanded.

It's safe man.  Just like I'm sure you will find areas in the US where gangsters etc. hang out, you will find the same here. The Highveld in South Africa (Johannesburg, Pretoria) and Cape Town itself do have problems with crime but the smaller towns like Mossel Bay, Knysna and George don't have the same degree of violent crimes.  It's much more relaxed.

Foreigners would not be forbidden to buy land but would have to fulfill certain requirements to own immoveable property.

Surely the beginning of the Chinese Bitcoin community to conjure up some plans for the future.  Realistically the regulatory bodies in China were always going to be draconian in dealing with BTC.  Now to wait and see if they can come up with sufficient innovation to still be market players.  Will be very sad if we lose the support of the Chinese Bitcoin community because of their government.  They are a huge part of the investment portfolio and the general development of BTC.

It doesn't really matter what bull they mention inbetween, the fact is people are more and more talking about Bitcoin as playing an inevetable part in the future of finance. The more frequently this happens, the easier it will be for new adopters to buy in and experiment with Bitcoin.

Primary school teacher in South Africa.  Gave a bitcoin presentation to my students the other day.  Lol, maybe they are still a bit young but thought sowing the seeds might lead to healthy future growth. :)

Total BS.  Verifying your account with proof of residence etc. is more than enough.

I personally think this is great for Bitcoin.  Well done guys! It will probably take some time for people to realize the significance of this and use it properly, but it should be worth your wait.
