You and almost everybody else is reading it wrong. He claimed to have about 100k BTC 4+ years ago.
Not $100k in BTC, but 100,000 BTC at one stage. AKA $1b+ if he's kept it.
He's just moved $400m.
@_date: 2018-01-27 20:13:25
He bought it the year before CMC started but on the date of the AMA it would've cost $5.1m and he said it had doubled his net worth so he was already a multimillionaire at that stage.
Judging from 2012's prices he spent anywhere from $150k-$600k for those Bitcoins.

So, BTC futures are worth what people think they're going to be worth, but people who speculate on futures tend to be pessimists because (generally) if an asset/share is at an all-time high it's reasonable to presume that a drop will come once the buzz dissipates.
Nowadays, BTC doesn't really pump because of news - it's being adopted because of the news, the brand, network effect, word-of-mouth.
If the guys interested in speculating on BTC's futures buy (or get their friends to buy on their behalf so it doesn't get traced back to them) a lot of BTC before futures speculation begins, they can lay large margin-leveraged bets to the tune of millions of dollars on the futures market that BTC will drop below a certain point. Let's say a 10x margin-leveraged bet that it goes down.
If they've taken note of how much BTC it would take to make everybody else's stop-losses activate and cascade downwards (flash crash) they can sell their BTC below that market value at just the right time for it to collapse, hit below the point where they said it would on the futures market and they get to win their bet.
If they bet $10m that BTC would drop below a certain level with 10x leverage and it does that, they've just earned $100m on the futures market.
They can also start buying the cheap BTC if they have the cash to buy it from the bottom.
And the churn begins!

Pump before the futures.
The Wall Street whales buying now will make a shitload of money from selling enough of their BTC below market price in our market and shorting it on the futures market.

Then don't respect the value of sharing knowledge.
If you think current max tx/day is sustainable (one transaction to hop onto a lightning channel per person every 65-75 years once we hit 10b people), tell me how?
Do you think people want to care about how they get paid or how they can cash out - another transaction in itself, something we either need to cash in or out of fairly regularly to live or we hand over to an exchange-like conduit in order to use their always-on liquidity - wow, such decentralisation. Also just a bank and not your wallet.
Where is this solved in the "let's make blocks smaller" debate?
Because it's talked about. With no solution. Samson Mow happily says BTC is worthless for payments "Who would design such a system?!?". Adam Back is happy to say it's purpose was not to usurp fiat but supplement and possibly take over gold. Luke is happy to say it looks like it'll never be a threat to anything and blocks should be smaller so everybody can keep the chain in a mountain hut with 56k internet.
The polar opposite of 2013.
@_date: 2019-03-09 21:31:35
Note that by cash out I mean "I have to transfer money to another channel with whom my original channel has no connection." Truly screwed if this thing is busy and expecting hundreds of millions of tx/day.

You talk like a bot tbh. Hope you have a good life, bot.
@_date: 2019-03-09 16:39:38
I have equal amounts of both. Let's all hope they can fulfill the original vision with small blocks, Lightning and a baked-in inability to scale to worldwide use even while using Lightning (opening a channel needs an on-chain transaction which is impossible to scale to a worldwide level with current blocksize, never mind the current murmurs of smaller blocks) along with a company called Blockstream whose employees and allies repeatedly state it's not to be used at all.
"Pump the money sponge, but never use it!"
What a functional and worthwhile concept that wouldn't have been had Satoshi ever written anything like that in the past.
@_date: 2019-03-10 09:36:54
Transaction time has nothing to do with how many miners there are, it just means less copies of the chain are being kept and it's less expensive to attack. Possible attempt at a block reorg which could mean a contentious fork if those 70% coming back online don't agree to play fair and keep the correct chain.
Wouldn't be an issue - the community would know which chain to follow, the ticker stays the same and the forked chain dies due to spiralling value.
Edit: happy cake day

Diversify and buy coins you'd be happy to own because you see some good in them. Look for the background of the coin, the devs or the team in general.
If BTC loses steam, chances are something else is gathering it. If BTC keeps on trucking at the same speed then the rising tide will bring everything else up with it eventually.

They didn't do  it's common misconception. The made a state change so the funds were locked in the thief's address and siphoned them back to their rightful owners.

Someone selling $10b would cause a huge crash, yes. The current market is the way it is because $20 to 30-ish billion would have been taken out.
Think about it this way - if $835bn real dollars had entered into crypto through last year up to the start of January, then crypto would be seen as a much greater threat. Crypto would be worth over 1% of the world's money supply in real terms. If that much money was pumped in we'd know about it - the lack of sell pressure on the way up, the dearth of bitcoin left to buy would cause the price to hit high trillions if $835bn of pure buying pressure was pushed onto the market.
@_date: 2017-10-16 19:10:10
