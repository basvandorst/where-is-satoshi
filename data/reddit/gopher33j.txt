My belief is that BTC and other cryptos will either be worth A LOT more in 5 years, or worth not much at all. I try not to worry too much about the day to day or even week to week price changes. I don't check the value of my house or 401K every day or even every month either - and with that mindset - i tend to not lose as much sleep over price swings up or down.

Find a CPA that knows something about this and go from there - don't take advice on the interwebs.
@_date: 2018-01-06 18:15:12
Damn - that's a good point. If you DO take my advice, you don't take advice from the interwebs. If you don't, then you can get your advice from the interwebs, and that includes me. 
Anyway, if you DO choose to listen to me, here is a good starting point: 
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:45:08
Take some gains. Spread taxes over several years. Smart investors are always taking out some gains. Same reason they sold stocks.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:26:47
HODL Me. (Lots of support at 12K mark on GDAX)
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:31:18
Within reason - yes :) 
@_date: 2017-12-30 16:28:33
This is exactly true. The stock market went down yesterday as well as investors were selling for year end.
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:18:41
WAY WAY more volume and liquidity in the stock market though - so yes, I think they are comparable. It only takes a few really big positions to make some sells in BTC to cause the market to go down. Same can't be said in the stock market. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:55:39
The bitcoin futures will settle to the Bitcoin Reference Rate, and it won't be possible to take delivery in actual Bitcoin like you could with commodity futures. This is an important distinction to keep in mind. Those buying and selling Bitcoin Futures will not have any exposure to the actual Bitcoin market. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:20:26
They aren’t. You self report it. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 04:30:15
Ask a CPA. If there was no gain - no tax owed.
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:12:21
And there was a lot less “big” money involved too...
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:21:45

It's only subject to capital gains if you hold it for more than a year. At least in the U.S. If you hold it less than a year, then it is taxed as ordinary income. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:26:15
The IRS hasn’t firmly stated yet - but it isn’t like a stock split. It’s reportable - if you ask any tax professional. I was “gifted” the Bitcoin Cash - so it’s a taxable event. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:21:01
...so. You are saying BTC operates in a market environment where buyers and sellers determine the price? BRILLIANT! 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:23:47
I encourage you all to check with a tax planner. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:14:39

@_date: 2017-12-10 04:28:22
You don’t pay anything until you sell. An asset increasing in value isn’t a taxable event - 
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:30:50
I ALMOST ALMOST SOLD - 
(but I didn't)
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:14:53

@_date: 2017-12-30 20:18:29
Exactly. I think they are taxable. But double check.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:38:49
Well - that really fucks my taxes for 2017. Damnit. I was hoping I wouldn't have access until 2018 so I wouldn't have to report Bitcoin Cash this year.
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:16:05
Already have. I’m paying a professional to do my taxes this year.

Somebody ~~hold~~ HODL me - I'm in shock. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:41:34
A lot of the rest of the world invests in U.S Stocks as well. People sell at year end to take profit, period. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 15:45:21
Correct. Sell before new tax year. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:41:25
TRYING. TO. SELL.
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:05:59
These aren’t commodity futures, they are cash settled index futures. So you can’t take physical delivery as an option upon contract expiration.

Short-term capital gains do not benefit from any special tax rate – they are taxed at the same rate as your ordinary income. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:37:20
You realize the cancelation has nothing to do with Coinbase, right? I know there is a lot of hate of Coinbase - but this is on the bank.

We always use all of our HSA money every year due to existing health concerns, so front-loading and funding the HSA on Jan 1 makes good financial sense for us. 
Be disciplined, and be smart. It's OKAY to sell a little bit here and there to stay balanced. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:25:48
Bitcoin Cash will most likely be taxed in the year it was "created" into users accounts, so that creates a taxable event right there. Also, solid investing principals = taking out profits periodically as you go. Auto selling at set prices, for example. In order to pay taxes on these events - people will take out money this year to get the estimated taxes paid prior to year-end to avoid a penalty. 
You are assuming every Bitcoin and alt-coin investor is buy and hold - they aren't. And if you sold Bitcoin for alt-coins, that is a taxable event as well. 
@_date: 2015-12-15 20:29:24
There has to be more to it than that - 
Are investors in China holding this in lieu of the Remimbi? Is this a long-term value hold, or merely speculation? 
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:53:56
Not if you a disciplined investor rebalancing a portfolio that is too heavily weighted in crypto. Again, if you sold bitcoin for altcoin, that is a taxable event. 
This is common disciplined investor behavior 
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:35:28
When you buy the alt-coin, is my understanding. 
@_date: 2015-06-02 19:18:00
Same here. I buy the same amount every week. I don't really care about the price at this point, I am accumulating "units".
Don't try to time anything, you will most likely lose.
@_date: 2015-12-15 22:53:10
You know, that makes a lot of sense. I did most of my buying in the $200 - $220 range. I figured that seemed like a good floor for a bit. 
Thank you.
@_date: 2014-12-22 20:20:48
I have been dollar cost averaging in for most of the year - buying same dollar amount every month. Whatever - I think this is a long-term play, not a short-term money maker. 
That's just me. 
@_date: 2017-02-21 16:21:27
Agree - that number is based on nothing. Retirement is all about cash flow planning - not how big is your bag of money and there are so many variations in terms of where you live and what your standards of living will be. If you live in a small town in Iowa, you won't need much at all to retire on - if you live in a large city, you will need a lot more. 
So many factors go into retirement - it's about saving for a magical dollar amount. 
@_date: 2017-02-09 16:34:07
Also bought some. 
Of course I buy some every week automatically - so there is that as well. 
Dollar Cost Averaging is your friend

Oh my God, the comments section is gold. 
@_date: 2017-08-08 22:00:04
So what? With a return on investment like that, who cares. At some point, the ownership of a "whole Bitcoin" means nothing. 
@_date: 2017-08-08 21:57:25
Agree. SOOOO many people out there have no clue what to do with saving for anything. If nothing else, you can give them the option of cryptocurrency as a PORTION of their overall investment strategy. 
The world still needs and will always need people like you. Good luck to you. 
@_date: 2017-08-11 15:26:10
As others have said, link a bank account instead. You lock in the purchase price but the coins take some time to show up. If you are buying to hold long-term, this shouldn't matter. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 14:52:02
Dollar cost average it. Buy the same amount every week - automatically. Don't try to time anything and guess when a good time to buy is. This is true in any market.
@_date: 2017-08-05 14:49:50
Those of you complaining you sold, make sure you have enough emergency cash on hand, should you need funds quickly. Don't treat BTC as a cash savings account. 
HODL you fuckers! HODL!!!
@_date: 2017-08-04 01:48:59
Never once did they say "nobody would be getting Bitcoin Cash" - Not ONCE. Nor did they ever claim they would keep BCC for themselves. This is a fairly anticipated outcome. I also left all my coins in their vault, and as a long term holder, I could give two shits if I get access to them in 5 months or 5 years. 
@_date: 2015-08-19 14:49:24

Depends entirely on your investment horizon. I'm holding my coins VERY long-term. Think 10 years or more. It's a hedge against the rest of my investments. 
If you are looking to make a quick buck - no clue. That is again up to your investment style and risk tolerance.

I was on the discord channel today and there are a lot of people commenting who have no business investing in ANYTHING. They poured their life savings in, they don't invest in anything outside of crypto...both of which are terrible ideas. 
They lack a timeline for their investments - and they assume everything will keep going up forever. 
I had little sympathy for some of them.

As a starting point into BTC, this is the easiest way to start. Agree. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 21:28:31
Your value went down - you didn't lose money. That is the key difference. When I was an advisor I would ask people how much money Warren Buffet lost on Black Friday crash of 1987. The answer is zero, because he didn't sell. He held.

No - don't be stupid. Why give up that much in penalties for no reason. 
Find a cheap self-directed IRA instead, like with Vanguard, and put your money there in index funds. Don't add more to it if you don't want to. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 20:24:50
Agreed, but it still has to increase 4X or so. JP Morgan has a market cap of over 300B, I believe.

I think it goes both ways. By the merchant accepting Bitcoin, the other customer in the store started asking questions and wanting to know more about it. He had no idea what it was or why we were agreeing to the transaction settlement the way we did.

Honesty - I would do it all now. Index funds are a longer term play - don't try to time the market. Put the 950 (roughly) into index, or split it between a few different index funds, and then use roughly 5% for BTC. 
The thing with investing is you have to be patient and let the money grow for years or decades. This could be a great start for you though. Just don't check the value daily or you will go crazy. You have to keep emotion out of investing.

Don't try to time it. Buy a little bit every week or month, regardless of price. Again, accumulate, you don't have to buy whole coins. 
*Never more than you can stand to lose
@_date: 2017-05-24 02:55:55
Best answer. 
@_date: 2015-03-19 01:32:16
I don't see that happening any time soon, not with today's news. 
@_date: 2015-11-03 17:21:54
@_date: 2017-05-26 19:37:32
No. This is completely normal market behavior - and was expected. People are starting to panic sell right now.
@_date: 2017-05-04 20:29:57
For some it is an extremely long hedge/hold. I buy it to protect the rest of my holdings - and I still buy the same amount every week regardless of current price. Those looking for a quick profit may want to consider holding - but I still have a lot of hope for the long long term upside, which I don't feel we have come close to hitting yet.
@_date: 2017-05-24 20:25:08
Not really. Dollar cost averaging works well - and that way I buy a little bit every week. 
@_date: 2015-03-25 18:35:15
Invest 950 in Index Fund. Invest 50 in BTC. 
You hedge a bit. No reason to put it all in one place.
@_date: 2015-03-01 00:49:02
Agreed, ICE is a derivatives exchange, and I bet they are thinking this could eventually start to take up some of the volume going into the traditional FX market. 
@_date: 2016-05-31 14:01:11
Exactly. This is a welcome change. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 18:19:25
Plus, if you are always buying from the same place, it's not that difficult at all. Time consuming, yes. Difficult, no.
@_date: 2017-05-04 16:51:10
SO WHEN DO I SELL?!?!?!?! 
@_date: 2016-05-03 19:52:43
I don't think is is as much about price as legitimacy. Price is purely driven from supply and demand - and this PROBABLY means more people will take an interest in BTC, thus wanting to buy some. Price SHOULD go up on such an announcement - it may not be linear though. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 19:56:36
It's called dollar cost averaging - and over the long haul it tends to work out better. Use your example of buying 10K at 2000. It could go down the next day and then back up, etc. It's usually better to spread it out over the course of several buys as it is all about accumulating units. So on average you will get more units if you spread it out. The past few months haven't been normal in terms of pricing. 
At some point, most likely, the price of BTC will be below $2,000. 
Just read here: 
@_date: 2015-03-06 14:57:22
Also true - BTC is about 1/2 of 1% of my total holdings right now. It's a brilliant hedge though. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 18:54:52
There are many ways to do that - many of the exchanges have price alerts. HOWEVER, don't try to time the market and guess when a bottom is or top is. It usually ends poorly, it doesn't matter if it is BTC, or stocks, or ETFs, you name it. BTC has gone down over the past few days. 
Just my advice though - 
@_date: 2016-05-03 14:24:28
Derivatives exchanges have WAY more volume than equity exchanges - it isn't even close. 
@_date: 2015-10-09 16:42:45
Yes. Still using Coinbase's vault though.
@_date: 2017-05-24 15:52:25
That's a problem I'm willing to deal with later, if/when I sell. I'd rather take the emotion out of my buying into BTC/ETH. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:54:41
Taco pizza? 
@_date: 2015-10-29 14:16:02
That is huge press for BTC
@_date: 2016-05-29 12:25:05
No, they aren't. Not even close. 
@_date: 2016-05-25 03:28:00
Ayyyyy Gringo
@_date: 2016-05-03 14:18:13
Correct on the leverage part, as most futures offer higher leverage, especially in the FX market. I wonder if this will be treated as a traditional commodity or as a financial future product. (Difference between Gold and USD/EUR contract, for example). 
I am fairly familiar with CME Group, and this is a big announcement. 
@_date: 2015-03-19 14:52:11
As long as people keep insisting on conducting BTC business anonymously, this will be an issue. For BTC to gain wide-spread adoption, it cannot and will not remain anonymous. That isn't what makes it attractive for more widespread usage.
@_date: 2016-05-31 18:21:43
Nobody here can tell you that. It could be genius or stupid - only time will tell.
@_date: 2016-05-03 11:58:21
This is huge. Bigger and than any news recently on BTC
@_date: 2017-05-25 15:33:10
Not a bad hedge at all, in my mind. 
@_date: 2017-05-04 19:54:09
My profit is zero until I sell - but that's the same with any other investment. I haven't "made" any money in my other investments either because I haven't sold anything. Nothing is realized until you "cash out"
My profit or loss only occurs after I sell. My holdings have gone up in value, but I haven't made any money. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:55:17
Tee Hee. I just bought more. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 21:44:43
This reminds me of the real estate market in the mid 2000s. "They aren't making any more land!" "Buy now or get priced out forever!" 
That said. HODL
@_date: 2015-10-14 19:49:38
Can confirm. I live in Illinois, and am on Gemini. I am the customer. 
Thank you. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 19:47:03
Yeah, so? 
@_date: 2017-05-05 18:12:40
Yes - but you don't ever sell in whole units. You would sell whatever you needed to convert to cash - or use a Shift card that does it automatically for you. 
@_date: 2015-10-14 21:48:01
My ACH hasn't cleared yet - so....it will be a week.
@_date: 2017-05-24 21:01:17
Quick, somebody post a $2,600 one! 
@_date: 2015-03-01 18:55:12
I stand corrected, they are an exchange, not a firm.
@_date: 2015-10-08 21:47:40
Exactly this - I can't move money into my account for a few days. I moved a small amount of BTC from Circle just to add to the volume of BTC available there.
@_date: 2015-10-14 21:33:24
My ach just processed, now it takes 2-3 more days to actually move the money over to Gemini. 
Slow but sure. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 15:27:51
This. I buy the same amount every week on the same day - automatically through Coinbase. Easy to set-up, and it takes the emotion out of it. 
@_date: 2015-03-19 01:25:13
BTC needs a good PR agent at this point. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 15:20:20
First - I don't recommend investing 25 - 33% of your salary in any one thing. That is foolish, in my mind. Cryptos should be part of a balanced portfolio. 
Honest advice, buy the same amount of crypto (BTC, ETH, etc.) on the same day every week. Keep in small and manageable, (I'd say no more than 10% of your salary, IF that, and provided you already emergency funds of cash to cover you if necessary). It's called dollar cost averaging, and it's your friend.
Good luck. Don't put all your eggs in one basket. 
@_date: 2017-05-04 20:36:15
it's exactly like a debit card. 
@_date: 2015-03-19 13:59:40
Exactly. 
@_date: 2017-05-20 19:20:09
Who wants tacos!!!! 
@_date: 2016-05-31 13:51:32
I'm at 5%. Much better than holding other money instruments, especially in a low interest rate environment. 
@_date: 2015-10-09 17:38:55
Not a bad puzzle for a Friday. I usually hate Friday puzzles for the lack of a theme. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 18:54:28
Yes, there is a purchase history.
@_date: 2017-07-20 18:45:24
Precisely. 
This isn't really a BTC question as much as a standard investment question. If you asked me should you buy mutual fund X for retirement dollars and you planned on using it 40 years from now - I would say "yes". 
Investment fundamentals don't change - 
@_date: 2015-03-07 13:38:22
Exactly - and if something goes HORRIBLY wrong with the rest of it, Maybe, just MAYBE, BTC will be there to rescue us. 
@_date: 2015-03-09 21:49:11
@_date: 2017-05-26 19:39:09
Exactly this. Buy the same amount every week/month/day - regardless of price. Take the emotion out of it. It is true of every investment, as you said. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 21:51:32
No I didn't! I'm going for my downvote record! 
@_date: 2017-07-23 22:42:34
Exactly. On average the stock market returns about 8% a year. The average investor gets less than 2% rate of return. Why? They try to time the market. Buy and hold with dollar cost averaging works in all markets - BTC is no exception to this rule. 
@_date: 2017-07-20 18:25:37
That entirely depends on your objective to owning BTC. Also, how much as you willing to lose? This doesn't just pertain to BTC, but ANY investment. The honest answer is NOBODY knows what the future price of ANY investment will be: Crypto, Stocks, Mutual Funds, Commodities, etc. 
The only honest answer is: Maybe. 
@_date: 2017-05-04 19:38:12
NEVER! I do have a Shift card though - if I wanted to use it. 
@_date: 2017-05-20 19:19:21
@_date: 2017-05-26 19:36:03
Truer words have never been spoken. BUY THE DIPS!
@_date: 2015-10-27 18:51:18
Wait - can I retire now? 
@_date: 2015-10-08 21:46:04
It reminds me of Google Wave's launch. 
(I have a limit order placed - so at least I'm trying it)
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:48:28
WHO WANTS TACOS! 
@_date: 2016-05-31 13:50:20
This is an extremely popular site among derivative investors. Interesting recommend on BTC, which I view as a commodity more than anything else - and Seeking Alpha must as well.
Keep holding folks, it's only going up from here. 
@_date: 2017-07-20 18:54:18
This exactly. Dollar cost averaging for me. I buy the same amount, every week, at the same time. That way I don't concern myself with price movements. 
@_date: 2015-02-20 21:48:38
If you don't think of Bitcoin as a currency, but a finite commodity - then having early adopters absolutely makes sense. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 20:25:41
Yes. The "BitCurrentcy" 
@_date: 2017-07-15 23:55:05
There you are. 
@_date: 2017-07-14 19:27:17
Can't answer that, my goal has always been to own 21 of them because I want to have 1/1,000,000 of the market cap. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 22:40:10
Excellent question. 
@_date: 2015-03-25 20:29:39
In the states I would send you to Vanguard.com for investing. Coinbase or something similar for BTC.
Honestly. Read "The Intelligent Investor" by Benjamin Graham. Came out YEARS ago, but it is a great read. 
Finance.google.com is a good simple website to keep up to tabs on everything financial. 
@_date: 2017-07-14 19:18:19
I don't buy as much as possible, it's always been a set amount, and it's only a small percentage of my overall investment. I still have stocks, mutual funds, ETFs, you name it. It's a percentage of my portfolio - and I'm not NOT buying other investments at the same time. 
I guess I don't treat Bitcoin any differently than any other long term investment, is what I am saying. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 21:25:46
Well - it's something. Thank you! 
@_date: 2017-07-14 18:27:03
While you are holing, I am buying more. If you are getting nervous over this, and "shitting bricks" you either:
A) Have too much invested in BTC
B) Have never invested in anything before
C) Both of the above.
Seriously, if you are getting nervous over this, rethink why you are invested in the first place. 
@_date: 2017-07-14 18:25:37
I'm not really sure what you mean, I just both quite a bit more due to this. It's a good thing! 
@_date: 2017-07-20 19:00:37
My favorite stat from when I was a financial planner - may not be exact: "The market (stock) averages an 8% rate of return every year, the average investor gets 2.5%. Why? Individual investors try to time the market..." 
Same hold true here. 
@_date: 2015-10-16 16:39:22
As the Illinois customer, I just bought.
@_date: 2017-05-04 20:28:59
Sure - I've used it for lunch on occasion, but that was summer of 2016. I always refilled it too by the amount I spent.
@_date: 2017-07-14 18:31:41
Who really knows. Maybe. I look forward to picking up more during the "civil war" 
@_date: 2017-05-24 15:29:41
You missed a zero.
@_date: 2017-07-20 18:10:44

@_date: 2015-02-22 17:13:07
I have been using TCF Bank with no problems on Coinbase for over a year. 
@_date: 2017-07-14 18:41:44
It's not what I think it will be today - it's what I think it will be in 5 or 10 years. Honestly, I buy the same dollar amount every week on the same date - and when it dips I buy a little bit extra. I'm more concerned about accumulating units at this point, rather than price. 
Breaking it down how you stated, if there will be millions of buyers eventually (my belief) price can only eventually move in one direction. There is more and more liquidity in the market every day - and just like anything, there will be dips and rises in prices. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 23:58:05
When moon?!? Now?!
I ready. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:31:31
That's why I just bought more!!!!!
@_date: 2017-05-24 18:13:54
From my boat.
