They closed my account for the same reason. Only about 4 year old account, but still. Froze several thousand dollars for over 2 weeks.

Correct.

I have been looking for a good place to make my Ice Bucket Challenge donation for a few weeks now. So thank you! I can say I've officially donated now.

I'd like to sell old model iPhone's. Used to do a pretty good amount of business on eBay but after a while I couldn't make it worth my time with their fees. I'm definitely interested in trying out the beta. I have a few iPhone's sitting here just waiting to get started.

No, it's a site for limit buy and limit sell orders using Coinbase. Extremely helpful and I used it a lot. Hope it just got too much traffic and this is only temporary.

I placed a couple orders already and am wondering how long it usually takes for orders to process? In other words, how long (normally) from when someone places an order until they receive their metals?

Haha me too! -900!

You sure about that?

This same thing happened to me, except at Chase, and to the tune of $1800. Buyer deposited cash and marked payment as complete. I then went to my online banking and verified that the deposit had been made. Once this was verified, I released the coins from escrow. As soon as he saw that the coins had been released from escrow, he returned to the same teller with his receipt and claimed that he deposited the money into the wrong account. They gave him his money back, seemingly no questions asked.
After hours spent in the Chase branch and on the phone with everyone from the "back office" at Chase, the final answer I got was as follows:
1. You should not have been conducting 'business' on a personal checking account. 
2. The policy of Chase is that tellers are allowed to return deposits to the same person who made them if they have the receipt and it is the same business day. 
3. In the future, you should wait until transactions have been marked posted (as opposed to still pending) to avoid this from happening again.
I have since largely curbed my use of localbitcoins and I am in no hurry to release coins from escrow. Sorry to OP but hopefully this helps everyone else out there using LBC.

This is for new buyers. Yes the fees are a bit high, but most of the fee goes to the credit card processors. A great way to get people involved in bitcoin quickly and easily IMO.

I promise you that article was written using this reddit post as its "source"

I think that's what OP was hoping you would come up with

I was just pondering this yesterday when my financial friend told me that metals continue to fall because of a lack of industrial demand. I think there's more to it than that.

This is really awesome. I'll be heading to Thailand in a few months and am excited to try this out. Also, why can't this be done everywhere?
