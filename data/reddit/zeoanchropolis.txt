Id take that over a lambo any day, or even better, a proper supra with a proper 2jz!

Im interested in this too, for example I would like to accept btc for stuff I sell on eBay but as it is I can only do that for stuff I sell in person. I reliable escrow service of some kind to facilitate this would be great imo

I mean I can't speak for others but I know I certainly would. More and more I hear about people who are unhappy with eBay's rising fees etc that it is no longer really profitable to do for smaller scale sellers and it is no longer a place to find good deal for buyers either. 
Obviously it would also depend on the adoption of crypto by the wider masses to succeed but even a site that mixed regular fiat payment methods as well as crypto I think would be good. 
I currently offer the option to pay for stuff when I do sell (I'm only a private seller) but obviously no one will sent btc to a random online and expect to receive goods (and I don't expect them too) so a site offering escrow services as well as minor dispute solving, reputation type things I think would in the long term be great to see happen. 
Maybe it's just me that wants this though , I honestly don't know :)

I'm just asucker for 90s jap cars, what can I say, I'd take an FD RX7 too ;). I do hope that this engine lives up to the 2jz but it has a lot to live up to :)

Dunno why you are being downvoted when you are closer to the truth, mixers aren't some guaranteed way of covering your tracks, it just obfuscate it slightly more. 
Switch it to monero, switch between monero wallets, switch back to btc. A lot more reliable seen as monero is properly anon.

I don't think you understand bitcoin, it already is.

I mean if you look at the "darknet markets" they are basically eBay circa 03 using a basic escrow system to handle payments in bitcoin. 
With eBay's increased fees and PayPal changing up things such as the way it deals with refunds not only is it not profitable for a lot of people any more but personally I don't want to support companies like PayPal any more by using them. 
A blockchain based "eBay 2.0" I think would be accepted and widely used if it could tackle the adoption of "normal" users

Dude this is bad advice from an opsec point of view. Moving those coins from one wallet to another and to a third is not going to obfuscate the block chain and make it not traceable. You need to use a mixer or something similar to try and do what you are describing. Wasabi wallet has one built in but there is a minimum participation amount. 
Alternatively you can change in into monero, switch in between a couple of monero wallets as that coin is based around privacy and anonymity on its chain, then go back to btc if you need the btc to spend. 
You may eat some extra money in fees going between coins and stuff but it that not worth your freedom?

It may be different in the US but in the UK there is no obligation to provide any services, advertised or otherwise if you don't have a form of payment they are willing to accept. 
The same as they can also refuse to serve you if you try to pay in an excessive amount of small change.
