If it wasn't for eBay, I would never use PayPal. The sooner it dies, the better.

Yeah it's not against the law to have a passport in the US and yes I agree, it is a bit extreme. I think the current rate for a passport is something like $200 which is a bit steep for the regular person.

I don't know about most people but I have a passport. I'm just not too keen on sending a copy of it to someone in Slovenia.

The only thing I got from this article was that he probably really, really liked Wolf of Wall Street. And is it just me or did anyone else notice that he didn't actually explain HOW bitcoins are supposed to be a ponzi scheme?

Christ give it some time. I was talking to my boss a week ago about bitcoins and he said he used to think email wouldn't take off because his mom didn't know how to use it. They now Skype regularly.

Kind of new at this so sorry if I sound like an idiot. 
Is there a converting app or website that converts mBTS/BTC to USD? When I see 30 mBTS, I really don't know what that means in dollars.

I remember trying to sign up for stamp. When I saw that they wanted a copy of my passport I thought to my self "well then, Bitfinex it is."

Great idea, terrible name. 
I doubt anyone wants to hear the word "hack" associated with bitcoins right now. I think just looking at the name made the price of a bitcoin tumble about $20.
