So we see a lot of predictions that bitcoin will one day be 200k or 1 mil or whatever. My question is this: while it might hit those price points, how many people could feasibly even sell with enough time to capture those price points before it dropped again?

Not true and sexist.

It’s just open-source code, not a vendor, so no.

i thought these services restricted bitcoin trading.

By prophecy I mean THE bitcoin prophecy that lays out the following price points:
April 2019: $5,300  
July 2019: $9,200  
October 2019: $16,000  
February 2020: $29,000  
July 2020: $56,000  
November: $87,000
That's as far as the prophecy predicts, and Mcafee gives himself until the end of 2020 for bitcoin to hit 1mil.
The data here doesn't make Mcafee's prediction look any easier to achieve. One interesting thing though is that the prophecy lays out how we will "slowly rise and rise. Then we will boom." So i would say even the prophecy leaves room for Mcafee to be right if that crazy boom happens in December.
Obviously someone should make a more detailed chart that does a better job of mapping time and past price points.
Edited for formatting.

Yes you can and should, in response to your first question, I mean to say.

Do people think that mass bitcoin adoption will be a contributing factor to the demise of the dollar over time as more people move their money from fiat to bitcoin, or is the dollar's fate sealed and mass bitcoin adoption merely a consequence?

I’d like to get a loan from this bank to buy bitcoin.

Okay, that's what I wanted to know. Thank you.
@_date: 2019-05-15 21:09:55
Okay, I will look into OpenNode. Thank you very much.

I've been wanting to set up an Ecommerce store that accepts BTC. Anyone have any guides they would recommend for setting that up? I'm open to using Shopify/Squarespace/other plugins or building it from scratch if there aren't any good vendor options.

I'm about to buy my first hardware wallet. I only own bitcoin and am not trying to do anything complicated--just want to securely store them off of Coinbase. Which software user interface do you prefer between Ledger Nano S and Trezor?
@_date: 2019-05-15 19:18:26
thank you.
