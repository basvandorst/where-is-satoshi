I don't think Bitcoin is inherently libertarian. Sure I can see why it would be very attractive to libertarians but I don't think everybody that's not a libertarian and is into bitcoin is just here because they want to get rich quick.
Personally I just really dislike how much power big banks and the financial sector in general have, that's why I'd like to see it succeed.

I don't think many people would disagree with that, libertarian or not. Everybody and their grandma hated the banks after 2008 but calling literally every aspect of society you don't like "socialism" is childish and makes it seem like you don't have any real argument.

Yeah but couldn't you at that point just close the channel on the blockchain and get your money back (minus the miner fees obviously)?
@_date: 2018-01-24 13:47:07
It might happen. But even if it does what does it matter? It's still a trustless system so it's not like those few big players will control your money and the blockchain itself will be as decentralized as ever, which is the most important thing in the end. Highly scalable systems are always a trade off no matter how fancy the tech you're using is.
Besides three nine availability nowadays isn't really a super hard feat even for smaller players.

Why would Nvidia invest anything if they can keep selling old tech at increasingly higher prices?
@_date: 2018-01-10 11:09:24
Not really but if you really want to go with that analogy, then yes it's going to be like a bank account you can open and close at will with basically no strings attached and with no risk to your money, also all the transactions with your bank are going to be completely trustless, also you will be able to send payments to other banks almost instantaneously and with very little fees. So like a bank account on steroids and with basically no downsides of a real bank account.
@_date: 2018-01-24 17:20:07


Everything is always both a step forwards and a step backwards. You will never get a perfect system with ideal behavior in every aspect, there is ALWAYS a tradeoff. The blockchain is really secure but doesn't scale well, LN may lead to decentralization and is not as strictly trustless as the blockchain.
I'd argue that the benefits vastly outweigh the drawbacks in this case.
@_date: 2018-01-24 13:17:34
That is a disadvantage for sure, but it can be more or less solved by having high availability Lighting nodes. This is not really impossible, most webservers today have &gt;=99.9% availability, it's basically expected nowadays. Also it's not expected for people to use Lightning for super high value transactions, you would probably want to do those on the blockchain directly.
And in the end nobody will want to open channels with wonky nodes, so I doubt this kind of loss of money would happen very often.

What's your definition of trustless then? You have to trust the CPU your code is running on, you have to trust the OS that's running on your computer, you have to trust the code that's making your transaction. There's a whole lot of trust involved no matter what you do.
@_date: 2018-01-24 15:37:09
It's trustless provided you have a highly available internet connection. This is not a completely unreasonable assumption in my opinion.

Maybe most people you know. I come from a relatively poor country (compared to West Europe at least I guess) and I know a lot of people that use shitty cellphones, usually, like I said, because they don't have a lot of money. I've also known people that buy dumb crap from those shitty TV shop channels. Sure it's their fault for not being more informed but clearly those companies sell their dumb shit year after year, if they weren't able to they wouldn't exist anymore.


No shit people won't work for free, but there's a lot of difference between free and working for minimum wage. Working for free will have you end up on the street, working for a minimum wage might just let you keep your shitty apartment for one more month. Sure if you invest more money into your workers you will end up with quality, loyal workers but like I mentioned before there's a big market for shitty, half-assed products and services. Also what's stopping from companies in a certain industry from colluding to keep salaries as low as possible?






That's your personal belief that the market will always work properly, it's not a fact. You will have to prove to me that the market always comes up with an optimal or near-optimal solution, that's what I meant by "magical invisible hand"
Also another thing I forgot to mention, what's the motive for companies to keep the environment healthy? Why would anybody care for the environment if there's no short term or even medium term profit from it?

That's ridiculous. If everybody thought like that society would pretty much fall apart. If someone close to you developed a serious drug habit or a mental illness wouldn't you want to help them or would you just shrug it off? If it's the latter then I would suggest you reevaluate your worldview or you'll end up completely alone.


Not everybody can. Starting your own business or taking a loan to go back to school carries some risk, some people just cannot afford that risk, they may have other people that depend on them.


Unless the owner of the restaurant also owns the property, in which case they have a clear advantage over the competition.


Thanks for lecturing me on my own culture, that was insightful. Not many people here have a "everything is shit" opinion all the time, people just realize life is unfair and sometimes you get dealt a shit hand and there's not much you can do about it. This is also how people think everywhere else that's not libertarian fantasy land.
Honestly I don't think it would be useful to continue this discussion, it seems to me you have a really black and white worldview with very little room for nuance, maybe it's because you're very young or have been living in a bubble. I honestly hope you change your mind some day.
@_date: 2018-01-04 20:33:57

Yep, that happens literally all the time in basically any industry. You have shitty low quality electronics, shitty low quality food, shitty low quality clothes and all of it keeps selling, usually because people can't afford any better but also because they keep duping uninformed consumers.


Yes it will attract people that don't have any other choice. Basically everybody in a dead end minimum wage job is there only because they don't any other choices, at least ones that don't involve too much risk for them or their families.
You could make the argument that this would all be fixed by having a truly free market but that would fall under the "magical invisible hand" argument to me and would require substantial evidence for me to believe it.

Yeah except the R&amp;D costs for the potential competitor would be insane. It'd take years of years of burning huge amounts of money before they caught up. There's a reason why there aren't any other serious GPU manufacturers other than NVidia and AMD. Same goes for CPUs.

That just sounds like a lot of mental gymnastics to me.

Sometimes that's exactly the choice. And yes I am of slavic descent and live in a slavic country, I see this shit all the time.


I can believe that's true (for now) for western countries, but I don't believe it holds globally. Also past performance does not always indicate future performance, I don't believe this pattern will hold when mass automation fully kicks in.

I don't think so. I don't believe capitalism is a force of good, it's clearly better than a centrally planned economy but that's not really saying much. It's wasteful, encourages sociopathic behavior and leaves a lot of people behind for no good reason. It's an economic model with an expiration date, and we're nearing it.

I don't think a 2mb block is going to solve the problem for more than a week or so because I believe you wrongfully assume the amount of transactions would stay the same. What you'd get is just more transactions and eventually the fees would be the same as they are today and then you're back at the beginning. The only people that would profit from this are the miners.
I'm not inherently against it though for some ideological reason I genuinely think it won't help much. If you want to serve the actual realistic amount of transactions that people want to do with Bitcoin you'd probably need more than 10mb blocks, which would be very dangerous IMO since it would likely drastically reduce the number of full nodes.
Maybe there could be like a "tryout" of bigger blocks. Increase blocksize to 4mb or so for a trial period of, say, half a year and see what happens. My guess is not much changes, you just have 4x the transactions you have today.
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:18:42
It is a correction though, I read it on a blog post.
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:02:03
I guess it really depends on how you define "self-made". If you come from a middle class background and turn yourself into a millionaire you can say you're "self-made" but I think it's also important to understand that even with just a middle-class start you're already far ahead of most people because you've grown up in stable and nurturing environment and your parent probably pushed you through college with their savings.
Someone from a broke household where the parents were absent because they were working crappy minimum wage jobs didn't have that and their "rags to riches" story would be that much harder for them.

Actually my question was what if 1,000,000 different people opened a channel with starbucks. They buy millions of frappucinos and after a year starbucks has whatever bitcoin and all those people have a bit less bitcoin. In the end all their wallets would need to be mentioned on the blockchain at least, no? That would be at least one transaction containing 1,000,000 addresses.
I guess what my question boils down to is what are the realistic numbers if LN would scale to, say, Visa size. How many channels would they be, how long would they last, and how many people would participate in each channel?

I heavily disagree. Not everybody can be a successful engineer/doctor/business owner/youtube personality/whatever if for no other reason then because there isn't a need for 7 billion of them. Most people can't and won't be any of those things, and that should be perfectly fine, yet it isn't for some reason.
Also "hard work" is a really relative term. Some things are hard work for some people and are super easy for others.
On a more philosophical note I also really dislike the fetishization of work that exists in most of the world. Why is everybody's worth measured in "hard work" and money? Is that really all there is to a person? What happens when most things are automated and you have a whole bunch of unemployed people, do you just declare them all to be lazy shits and let them starve?

Well let's say BCH gets equally popular as BTC, then there could only be less nodes as the hardware requirements would be larger, that would for sure be a deterrent for some people. And if it then gets 10 times more popular than BTC is now then again you would need even beefier nodes, meaning (proportionally) even less nodes.

I doubt most governments would be that shortsighted.

What gives billionaires the right to live a life of immense luxury when some of their fellow humans are starving to death?


How is it fair to the children of parents that have been "slacking off"?
See I can use basically the same argument. You act as if property rights are something enshrined in the very fabric of the universe, math and logic. They're not. It's a matter of different worldviews, I believe people don't have an inherent right to turn a blind eye to anybody but themselves and their immediate families. I believe this because nobody lives in a vacuum and only what's inside their brains determines if they succeed and fail. We are all products of our environment whether we want to admit that or not. Successful people are successful at least partly because of outside factors they themselves didn't choose. Same goes for unsuccessful people.
And hell, let's assume you're completely right and most poor people are just stupid and lazy (which I heavily disagree with), do they and especially their children really deserve the misery they're getting? Not everybody is cut out to be a successful businessman/engineer/doctor, why do they inherently deserve miserable lives?

Her critiques are horribly shallow and sensationalist, it's clear that she doesn't really understand the material she's trying to critique (she herself even stated she is not a gamer and games don't interest her all that much), it's not that she's completely wrong and that there are absolutely no problems with representation of women in video games it's just that a lot of the time she completely misses the fucking point.

It doesn't work that way. Crippling poverty is one of the major causes of depression around the world. You can't really pull yourself by the bootstraps if you think everything is hopeless.

Nope, not to this one. It's an all around really dumb idea, it's almost the same as gambling your entire net worth away, even if it works out in the end you're still an idiot for doing it, just a lucky idiot. I guess it may not be the dumbest idea (although still pretty dumb) if you at least diversify with more cryptocoins but keeping it in just Bitcoin is insane.

Because it's really fucking suspicious. About 45% of the volume of BCH since the jump in price came from one single exchange from Korea, how is that not the least bit suspicious?


The two "random" coins being in the top 5 by market cap. It would be a pretty logical decision to go for either of them.

I don't think your analogy is good. There was never a serious competition to HTTP, there is a lot of competition to Bitcoin.
I would sooner compare Bitcoin to MySpace but even that analogy falls apart pretty quickly. It's a very new and different thing and looking back in history in order to predict the future is pointless IMO.
@_date: 2017-11-22 09:57:55
No, it seems that you don't. Miners aren't here to be pampered like kings. I'll pay the absolute minimum amount that gets my transaction on the blockchain. If the network is congested, you pay more, if it's not, you pay less, that's how it was always supposed to work.

But it doesn't solve any problems in the long term. Increasing block size isn't a good scaling solution, you can't keep doing it forever. It was a knee-jerk reaction with no lasting value.
@_date: 2017-11-23 15:11:02
What does that matter? Every time BCH explodes in value it's this one exchange moving things. If it were completely organic and user driven wouldn't the volume distribution look more like Bitcoin's?
@_date: 2017-11-16 08:15:47


Some of it is, some of it isn't. How can you say new companies popping up and offering new jobs isn't growth? The system is far from perfect but can you really categorically claim it doesn't work since it worked (albeit imperfectly) for the last 70 years?
@_date: 2017-11-11 14:07:23
If this was the market being unhappy about tx fees and confirmation wait time the market would go to ETH or LTC or XRP or whatever. As far as "coffee buying feasibility" goes BCH is better than BTC but it's still overwhelmingly terrible compared to other coins. This is another attack.
@_date: 2017-11-21 16:41:15
ETH is the most likely one IMO, but who knows, maybe something completely different and better appears.
@_date: 2017-11-11 10:43:38
I mean even if he's right about the whitepaper, so what? Satoshi is a smart guy but he's not a omniscient god, maybe it's better that BTC evolves past its original intention. Maybe he even, get this, changed his mind in the meanwhile.
I personally would like to use BTC for "coffee" transactions but if it ends up being digital gold I'd be fine with that too.
@_date: 2017-11-14 22:47:27
Yeah I don't get how they haven't scaled already. They must have some tremendously shitty backend code. Although to their credit I've had very positive experiences with their customer support, they respond very quickly.
@_date: 2017-11-23 08:58:08
Look at where 40% of the BCH trading volume is coming from. It's a single exchange in Korea. Is that not the least bit suspicious to you? Either Koreans are some kind of investment gods that are able to see into the future or there is some shady shit going on.
@_date: 2017-11-09 08:33:13
XRP is already the "fast money coin" but it still didn't really take off. I think the Bitcoin "brand" is pretty important.

That's a problem that's completely unrelated to the concept of fiat currency.


I guess we just have very different definitions of broken.

1984 was basically a critique of the Soviet Union of the time, it was never supposed to be this big social commentary about surveillance and state that everyone always makes it out to be, it was very specifically a jab at the Soviet Union. Gorge Orwell was a libertarian socialist so he was constantly critiquing authoritarian socialism of the Soviet Union and other similar regimes.

I'd worry more about the "leaders" of that project being complete fucking clueless idiots than about military dictators. The land they claim is not "no man's land" as they claim but actually disputed land. The problem is if Croatia gives that land to Serbia then it also has to concede some other land it does not want to give, and vice versa. It is agreed between Serbia and Croatia that the actual land is temporarily now under the jurisdiction of Croatia so de facto it is Croatian territory (for now).
Also AFAIK that area is very prone to flooding so actually building something there is bound to be a disaster.

Because it was the easiest way I assume. I mean look at it from his point of view, he probably doesn't give a shit about Bitcoin, he has obligations to produce this and that amount of fiat money by this or that date and he did it in the simplest way possible. He's doing the job he was hired to do.

No they haven't. Do you really think someone in the CIA or KGB read 1984 and went "oh yeah dude we should totally be doing this"? The thought to do that came natural with the advancement of that particular technology. In fact the Soviet Union was already known for bugging the apartments of suspected political opponents around that time. Orwell wasn't really being particularly observant with that particular aspect nor was he trying to be.
@_date: 2018-02-17 00:37:47


That's true enough, but your original comment came off as a bit elitist when you mentioned all of those highly technical things.
IMO what's most important for most people to know are the basic properties of Bitcoin (decentralized, immutable, finite supply etc...) and basic stuff about private and public keys. Also the basics of the lighting network once that goes mainstream. You also don't really need to be a crypto expert to talk about the economics of it, it's enough to know that the supply is limited and in what way are Bitcoins generated exactly.

This is not true at all. Both want the land, however claiming the land would mean yielding other pieces of land which is of course undesirable so no agreement has yet been reached. However both countries agreed that for now the land shall be administrated by Croatia, so technically for now it is for all intents and purposes croatian land. What Jedlička claims is just no true at all, there is no room for different interpretations.

I see that the ratio is increasing, which clearly means more batching is happening but the absolute amount of outputs is decreasing, doesn't that mean there is no growth?
@_date: 2018-03-26 11:21:12
Is there solid proof that it's really due to more batching? My thinking is that the market is in a lull right now so naturally the number of transaction is dropping too.

You mean like literally everything else that has assigned value? Scarcity doesn't imply it has inherent value.
