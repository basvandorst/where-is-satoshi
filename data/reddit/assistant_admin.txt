Always buy when the price is lower and sell when it higher. That way you will make money. I should teach for a living.

Short the Venezuelan dollar.

I care about litecoin and how this tech rolls out there.

I just described your logic to the people in the room and they are agreeing with me. I now request that you do not give advice to anyone on any topic.

The only problem with Berkshire Hathaway being priced so high is that you can only buy an integer number of stock and therefore it is priced out of reach for most. An integer amount of satoshis is your granularity on bitcoin.

A single coin is an arbitrary amount. Satoshi could have only used satoshis as a unit it didn't matter except the psychology.
When buying shares, do you skip more "expensive" index fund shares?

You analyzed those values and give financial advice to reddit to only buy btc and eth. Then you go deeper to say that btc is more than eth so only buy btc?
You shouldn't give financial advice to anyone.

I didn't say anything about your belief. You indicated your analysis was assuming that the values are right. Assuming a goal of maximizing profit, choosing the coin with maximum increase in price compared to now would do that and it definitely isn't btc. I didn't check the rest but I know the iota is a much larger gain.
My statements are rational and I repeat my request that you do not give anyone financial advice.
