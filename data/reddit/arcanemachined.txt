Minus the wash trading, which serves to prop up the perceived value of Bitfinex's trading fees.

Are you paying respects or telling me that I failed?

Google is that way friend --&gt;
@_date: 2017-12-04 12:30:46
Uh no, my friend. The difficulty of the blocks is regularly adjusted to compensate for an increase or decrease in the amount of miners working on the problem.
EDIT: From [bitcoinwiki](




So, about every 2 weeks, the block difficulty is adjusted to recalibrate the difficulty to keep the average block time at 10 minutes.

Merry Christmas, dumbass!

Yeah! We're trying to have a circlejerk here!

Yeah the newspapers seem like a pretty reliable source of information.

Oh my God that would be beautiful. Not even for the price increase, but simply to stick it to the bears.

I lost my private key. Is that a capital loss?
@_date: 2017-12-04 13:01:48
I wouldn't agree, although that does raise an interesting point: does the algorithm account for historical difficulty adjustments? I wouldn't think so because I'd imagine it's more important to keep current block times at 10 minutes than have an even average since day 0.
At any rate, the total block time average is 94.2% of the intended target (10 minutes), for a true average block time of 9 minutes and 15 seconds. Plus if you look at the early history of Bitcoin, there was a lot of higher-than-normal block times during the first ~2 years of mining.
So while seems to be a downward trend in block times (as long as the hashrate increases), I don't think 7-minute average block times are a likelihood.
I'm not gonna say I win, but unless you can provide better data... I guess you lose.

Yeah but what about Tesla? Uber? Juicero?
You know what, I don't think you understand how tech works.

Lol salty. If you don't think that Juicero is a modern success story, then I hope for your sake we can find a cure for autism soon.
