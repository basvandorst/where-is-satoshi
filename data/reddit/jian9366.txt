trading platform is cheating
@_date: 2014-02-12 22:40:47
But i'll never trush this cheating bitcoin. This is a game of cheating. The bitcoin holders cheats the potential buyers.
@_date: 2014-02-12 22:56:34
Dude.You don't know what the exchange is doing.
@_date: 2014-02-12 22:35:26
An exchange is more trustbale than GOV? Are u kidding me?
@_date: 2014-02-12 22:38:13

Got to explain your another cheating tricks to the bitcois victims.
@_date: 2014-02-12 22:39:00
Go to trust the fucking exchange like MTG BTCE....
@_date: 2014-02-19 16:19:48
nobody would know if they did
@_date: 2014-02-12 22:26:14
Government is more trustable than a fucking exchange
@_date: 2014-02-12 22:53:37
You should have some common sense. Dude. 
@_date: 2014-02-12 22:24:41
I mean the amount of bitcoin in a trading platform is unknown. For example, an exchange has 1000 BTC. But they can sell 100000 BTC to users in their platform. No one knows this until more than 1000 BTC needs to be withdrawn.

Thanks a lot. But I was a little confused. Who determines the rules of transaction fees? Can the transaction fees rules be changing in the future? Does that means somebody can change the amount of the transaction fee as he/she want?
@_date: 2014-02-12 22:08:34
How can you guarantee the exchange is not counterfeiting bitcoins?
@_date: 2014-02-12 22:25:36
The government is the one we have to trust
@_date: 2014-02-12 22:33:08
You don't know what i'm saying
@_date: 2014-02-12 22:31:53
Government is not trustable. A fucking exchange like MTGOX is trustable?
