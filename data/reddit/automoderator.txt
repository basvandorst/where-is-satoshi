It appears you are inquiring or commenting about the new altcoin referred to as Bcash (BCH, BCC, Bitcoin Cash). As with all altcoins, Bcash is technically off-topic for the subreddit. However, Bcash was created based on Bitcoin's transaction history, and therefore all Bitcoin owners should be able to retrieve an equal amount of Bcash with some effort.
In order to help readers navigate this confusing situation and minimize disruption of relevant content, has dedicated a sticky thread where readers can ask questions or leave comments pertaining to Bcash. If you are wondering how to retrieve your new altcoin holdings, please read the sticky thread thoroughly. If you don't see a similar question, please be sure to mention your wallet method and preferred exchange so that other readers can help address your concerns. You are also invited to submit new threads to the subreddit if you so choose.

It appears you are inquiring or commenting about the new altcoin referred to as Bcash (BCH, BCC, Bitcoin Cash). As with all altcoins, Bcash is technically off-topic for the subreddit. However, Bcash was created based on Bitcoin's transaction history, and therefore all Bitcoin owners should be able to retrieve an equal amount of Bcash with some effort.
In order to help readers navigate this confusing situation and minimize disruption of relevant content, has dedicated a sticky thread where readers can ask questions or leave comments pertaining to Bcash. If you are wondering how to retrieve your new altcoin holdings, please read the sticky thread thoroughly. If you don't see a similar question, please be sure to mention your wallet method and preferred exchange so that other readers can help address your concerns. You are also invited to submit new threads to the subreddit if you so choose.
**We kindly ask that you post your message in the sticky thread linked below and delete your initial post. Otherwise, it will be left to the discretion of the mod team. Thank you!**
