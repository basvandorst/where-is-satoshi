LOL that subreddit is for archiving inside jokes from our channel. Go ahead and look at every post, actually you probably have since your our only reader :(. Also if you looked at the my other subreddits they are jokes too.

Hollywood gossip columns have more integrity than this idiot. I think his audience is intended for preteens since he comes off as one.

He probably uses the dust he gets from his referral bonuses for 
"market making" haha what a loser.

I wasn't fleeced at all and they are not lying. This was a extreme case where 46% had to be taken. You clearly don't understand how futures work. Okcoin had little systemic loss whereas 796 and Hooby had a much bigger loss. Every exchange that trades futures has this system in place.

I lost about 10.25 bitcoin of profits because of this. It was made perfectly clear to me signing up, so users knew what the risks were. Sure I am sad that hooby had to come to this but most of what this post is saying is outright false. 
1. No one is angry or calling the police . I was in the BitVC QQ chatroom everyone was understanding because they knew the risks. 
2. Because of this Hooby is crediting all commission fees for the amount you lost (I get about 10.25 bitcoin credited to cover my fees) 
3. No where in  does it say that huobi got taken by a heist
4. Account is 1 hour old

For people asking why they are allowed to auction the 50k coins without a verdict -&gt;  states
    How did the USMS get the authority to sell these bitcoins?
On January 27, 2014, the United States District Court for the District of New York entered a Stipulation and Order for Interlocutory Sale of Bitcoins. In this order, both the United States and Ross William Ulbricht agreed that “the United States, in its sole discretion, may sell any portion or all of these bitcoins, on a date or dates and in a manner to be determined by the Government.”

I Just want to post my reply from the other thread from here 


**It was Bitfinex's circuit breaker to prevent cascading margin liquidations.**
Looking at the chart it looks like a LU/LD Mechanism you can read more about it here:

It is true that most people are shorting. Pushing the price down via short sells causes long positions to liquidate when they reach a certain threshold. This could trigger another long position to liquidate which could trigger more long positions to liquidate at market price(cascading margin liquidations). To prevent extreme volatility they use mechanisms such as halting trading, and Limit Up/Limit Down Mechanisms to prevent extreme price volatility.

I was not talking about the maintenance period where they halt trading. I am talking about the site becoming unresponsive when their backend goes down. This has happened numerous times.  
If you think this is a good alternative to okcoin you are confused. It has none of what you scrutinize other exchanges for -- like algo orders, thin spreads, etc. This is just the run of the mill bucketshop. There only strong point is anonymous Forex trading and that is about it. 
Also you are confusing me for someone else.

I tested this exchange out and they have really horrible service. This is the same site that went down during the dump of November 4th. 
Highly unreliable as the site tends to go down which makes it impossible to contact support. Withdrawals are delayed up to 24 hours. And even if you did trade using max leverage the spreads on BTCUSD are ridiculous.

The only thing these buffoons are trying to pump is the number of naive individuals trying to join their groupthink chat 
notice how the OP in this [post](
posts the exact same way as using the double hyphens.
nice shill attempt though.  
***Edit***: OP deleted his comment, I think OP is How pathetic of him...
