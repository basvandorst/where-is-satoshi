Nope I wouldn’t recommend blockchain wallet
Best wallets for Android are. edge wallet, BRD wallet, Electrum, coin.space, bitpay and some others you could find by doing a research.

Does cash app request KYC?

How much did you lost?

Strange that all time travelers come back just for bitcoin ������
@_date: 2019-07-26 19:05:35
How does it prevent scammers?
@_date: 2019-07-15 16:33:47
And how does it affects it ?
@_date: 2019-07-24 21:15:32
Personally I haven’t used it but its got a good reputation and is open source. So it should be good, but do a research about it before using it.

No addresses that are used by first miner hold thousand or millions coins each address holds 50 btc and are not spent satoshi mined around 19600 blocks so  that’s how he/she/they got around 900k to 1 million coins and are not moved.
@_date: 2019-03-14 10:22:03
They can but it will be a centralized currency and people don’t trust in it until it’s decentralized
@_date: 2019-03-28 23:48:06
Good-luck getting that amount from someone ��
@_date: 2019-03-14 08:41:16
Can’t you stay anonymous? Why pay government taxes of your crypto? 
@_date: 2019-03-11 21:43:06
Go to localbitcoins.com you get dozens of choices to buy bitcoin without using your debit/credit card
For most of the times i buy btc with western union
But! Be sure to buy from someone who got a good reputation that will help you not getting scammed

The only way is to get your old phone back, same thing happened to me I can’t login because my old phone is broken and I can’t access to the authentication code 
@_date: 2019-03-09 14:40:13
Buy with western union or other cash services 
@_date: 2019-03-10 16:53:05
I’m going to send him a message and pretend that I’m new to bitcoin and want to invest money let’s see how he’ll act
@_date: 2019-03-08 17:01:22
I’m using Dropbit as a test so far it’s doing great  and very easy it’s the first wallet that you can send btc to your contacts.
@_date: 2019-03-26 21:10:39
I just saw 600 transactions per second! 
@_date: 2019-03-10 16:42:56
Before i get to they stage of ID it asks for some information about the binance account and some transactions and the date of making the account, so when i give all information it says we can’t verify you are the owner! It’s not taking me to the part of ID verification 
@_date: 2019-03-10 23:40:12
Once my laptop was broken and I wanted to get back the files, i took it to a computer specialist and he took my laptop’s hard drive and installed on another laptop and somehow i got everything back, I still don’t know how, so if you can find someone like that they might get your data back 
@_date: 2019-03-16 13:03:22
How is it possible to have words in a private or public key? 
@_date: 2019-03-10 17:03:06
Ok I’ll let you know but for sure he scammed you and  this happened to many ppl who are new to bitcoin 
@_date: 2019-03-10 14:17:04
And does it tells why you can’t log in? 
@_date: 2019-03-20 21:17:26
Try to buy with western Union or cash in person that’s much safer 
@_date: 2019-03-11 22:01:53
You need to search for it, there’s some users who would charge 5-10 dollars for example u can get $140 in btc and paying around $150-$160 in cash at a WU agent 
@_date: 2019-03-26 21:05:40
Except miner fees which is around $0.30-$1 you do not pay anything extra to withdraw whoever that person is, they are trying to scam you be careful 
@_date: 2019-03-14 09:09:33
Do what you want man but the government is the true scam, you are doing everything but they are making profits from your investments 
@_date: 2019-03-10 15:42:39
That doesn’t work, i gave them every single detail on my binance account and every transaction that i ever made with binance addresses with the amount I deposited/withdraw from it, yet they say we can’t verify that you are the owner of the account!
@_date: 2019-03-08 17:22:08
I have donated some btc to a group of people who help iraqi refugees 
At least each family has lost 1 or more of its members due to isis attacks, they are not charity but they do what charities couldn’t do
I’ve volunteered and worked with them for few months and after I knew that they are doing it and spending their own money without getting back a single cent I decided to donate some btc
I don’t believe in most charities because they are not transparent and probably the money we donate is never used to help ppl 
@_date: 2019-03-11 15:20:30
So this dude is telling me if i send him$500 in bitcoin and after 48 hours i will get $2200 lol if mining was that simple everyone would mine bitcoin and he said I created a blockchain wallet for you it’s a watch only wallet that means I can’t spend it’s money until i have private key or 12 passphrase, so he is the owner and is fooling ppl by telling them this is your wallet,
Can anyone seeing this go and report him on instagram so  he don’t scam ppl anymore, ppl like him are not meant to be in the bitcoin revolution 
@_date: 2019-03-12 23:07:27
Did not buy at $113 �� biggest regret that I’ll never forget ����‍♂️
@_date: 2019-03-10 15:52:41
That is interesting! How you did it?
@_date: 2019-08-14 17:52:44
Which wallet did you use?
@_date: 2019-08-14 20:01:31
Without remembering your username and email then the only way to restore is to use the pdf from backup section of the wallet did you backed up your wallet?
@_date: 2019-06-18 13:31:00
@_date: 2019-06-28 18:35:29
They don’t care,in the whole region only few people know about cryptos:)
@_date: 2019-06-04 16:15:44
A brilliant programmer and a cartel boss! Maybe he needed to transport his money in a secure way so he created bitcoin! That’s possible
@_date: 2019-10-25 11:28:19
Just don’t invest your whole life and time in one single thing, bitcoin can go to zero at anytime, do your courses and bitcoin together.
@_date: 2019-06-28 19:23:57
Nope not yet, Not legal not illegal, some corrupt politicians might’ve bought huge amounts,but as public not much people know about it.
@_date: 2019-06-27 21:15:17
Error 500 is an internal server error
@_date: 2019-06-04 11:10:57
Where i live electricity is very cheap and computers as well but the problem is no one knows about Bitcoin ����‍♂️
@_date: 2019-06-22 19:54:42
Yesterday it wouldn’t let me send more than $0.99 and it said daily limit reached while I haven’t used coinbase for more than 3 days!
@_date: 2019-06-28 13:56:42
12 words 12! There’s more than 450 million combinations to it,a brute force won’t find easily, there’s more chances of solving without brute force
@_date: 2019-06-22 22:17:25
It’s a stable coin means it’s price doesn’t change  much so people will sell btc or other shitcoins when high and buy usdt then when btc and other shitcoins drop they buy more, it’s a good trading method in my opinion
@_date: 2019-06-15 19:34:32
Why not send to your bank account? Find a bank in Korea and send it to your bank account, I don’t suggest you go with bitcoin for this matter, your point is to turn cash to bitcoin then bitcoin to cash again one simple mistake might make you lose thousands if not all of your money
@_date: 2019-06-27 13:42:01
Blockchain have bugs most of the times, coinbase can temporarily block you accessing your funds not Good for you, for smartphones wallets I would suggest you go with edge wallet, Dropbit, BRD wallet, but hardware wallets are secure and a must if you have large amounts of bitcoin and other currencies
@_date: 2019-06-11 22:10:51
I would like to do the same but people will call me scam instead of donating ����‍♂️
@_date: 2019-06-04 15:32:20
Just scan the public address then verify with private key and you will have your wallet
@_date: 2019-06-11 21:25:43
Let’s say someone got all words? How can they put it in the blockchain wallet  exactly as the real one? It needs a brute force ��
@_date: 2019-04-20 21:24:18
Probably kidnaped , killed or jailed
@_date: 2019-04-12 08:51:22
Dark web ! I didn’t buy at $130  that’s something I’ll never forget ����‍♂️��
@_date: 2019-04-18 19:25:15
What is wrong with all these donations to an old building! Why not donate to provide clean water and food to starving African childs? They can raise 1 billion dollars in 24 hours for mythical religion but can’t even think about kids that are dying every 6-10 seconds due to lack of nutritions
@_date: 2019-09-09 15:05:34
What is this bakkt?
@_date: 2019-09-12 15:16:51
In iraq electricity is very cheap, but cold weather? Nope it goes up to 55 C in summer
@_date: 2019-09-08 10:34:08
Does this means that a private key can be seen in a public key by a quantum computer in future?
@_date: 2019-09-14 21:26:28
Ahhh Sh!t ��
@_date: 2019-05-31 12:22:38

Bitcoin 85% other 15% make your own research and buy a cheap coin that you believe you will make a good profit from it
@_date: 2019-05-31 12:21:51
DropBit is awesome
@_date: 2019-05-23 23:22:13
Dropbit is open source and easy to use check it out
