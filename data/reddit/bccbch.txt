buy small amount there, Hodl it there, wait until lightning is implemented there, then you can withdraw without big fees.
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:01:22
you can buy there but withdrawal onto a bitcoin address will take fees. maybe you wanna hodl and let it lay on virwox.

PUMP IT UP: 
@_date: 2017-09-16 23:47:55
dont forget to mention this experiment was a miserable fail except for the publicity.
running this miner will net you ~ 1 us-cent when running it for 24 hours!
assume 10000 people run it for the median stay of 5 minutes on the site, you end up with far under 1 $.
compare the avarage popup ad company pays you 1/10th of a cent per popup, so 10000 people would net you $10.
@_date: 2017-09-16 23:58:00
check my comment. 
when they are greedy for some measly single dollars, it rather proves that there is still an actual owner/operator and not the fbi.
@_date: 2017-09-25 14:56:38
thought the same... mempool is blowing up and now blocktimes of 1 hour...

Send the coins to a address only he knows they keys of.
Revoking access from a key is not possible.
@_date: 2018-12-09 14:10:10
Or you give him your key and he can do it himself
