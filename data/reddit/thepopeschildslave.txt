The CPI is a government controlled means of measuring inflation. The government has an incentive to under state the inflation rate due to social security and other payments being tied to it. the "basket of goods" that the CPI tracks has no baring on what people actually buy, and is not standard year to year. the target rate is 2%, the true rate ill let you discover on your own. If people knew the true inflation rate it would (could) crash the economy.

segwit requires less bytes per transaction, fees are paid per byte, therefore lesser transaction fee. I guess you can say its faster in peak times for the same dollar value compared to a non segwit transaction. segwit is only cheaper from a segwit address to a segwit address. you can still send form a segwit address to a non segwit address though.

every time bitcoin is received at a wallet it comes in its own piece. so if you send say 10 transactions of 0.01 bitcoin to one address, it will be 0.1 bitcoin.     but say you wanted to then send 0.1bitcoin to pay for something/to an exchange, then the size of that transaction would be a larger instruction in the mempool, requiring more bytes. fees are prioritized on a basis of satoshi/byte, so this 'dust' address would cost more to send from than a comparable address that was just 0.1btc in, 0.1 btc out.

12.5 bitcoins are created every 10min(aprox) block, so 657,000/year. Thats 11.7 billion dollars worth at right now prices. This leads to increasing numbers of mining ASIC's entering the space to compete for this reward, of which their primary expense is power. As the mining economy progresses it will come closer and closer to energy consumption cost= reward, so if prices were to remain steady were talking about ~9 billion dollars/year in energy towards bitcoin. If prices increase substantially, the incentive will increase with it, and we could be in a situation where mining bitcoin is an even more considerable energy hog.     
Is there a way to prevent this?      
with a fork the payouts can be changed to release fewer bitcoin/block but that is unlikely to find consensus.... or a proof of work change but again unlikely....      
the block reward will half in 2020 to 6.25/block, but if bitcoin were to double in price between now and then (not a prediction) then were still left with consuming billions of dollars/year of electricity.       
on the other side of it, how much energy is expended in mining gold these days? gold is only mined because its 1300/ounce, and its only 1300/ounce because its a store of value. If gold were no longer a store of value and plummeted to $10 an ounce no one would mine gold, and we would have plenty of gold to make our jewels, electronics etc. You can argue that gold mining is just as much of a waste/impact on the environment too.     
not saying that bitcoin minings use of power isnt a problem, just saying if you step back and look at a lot of things its pretty silly.

i was unaware that miners can create transactions that other miners cannot mine. if this is the case, as a miner, why not just make your own transactions and only scoop the higher paying transactions off the mempool, say over 100sat/byte.      
and then, what difference does a block increase make, as the miners can still flood their blocks.     
as long as they dont do it to a degree that causes people to fully stop using bitcoin and crashing the price, there is no real way to stop this without a second layer protocol.     
i may be naive though, as i havent seen this angle discussed before

1) fee is charged per byte, represented by satoshi/byte. if your wallet has only received 1 transaction and youre sending 1 transaction that would be a minimal sized transaction and have less bytes than say a wallet that had 100transactions in sending to 1 wallet.

im having a very difficult time interpreting your opinion and support of crypto, and i absolutely love it. I agree 100% that the IRS or CRA can make your life a living hell, freezing bank accounts and making it impossible for you to get credit. but that doesn't equal seizing properly secured bitcoin. First off, everyone should take precautions so that the IRS and CRA cant even prove you have a certain amount of bitcoin or any at all... "yes uncle sam i bought bitcoin in 2017 but i lost the keys/spent them on drugs"     
I take it you are a crypto supporter and critical of government which i respect. I take it you believe the government *USA and Canada* has impunity over its citizens which i do not agree with, as these governments need reasonable doubt you committed a crime to freeze assets in this way. Even if crypto were made illegal its very hard to prove ownership.     
crypto is a hedge against corrupt governments and monetary policy. I think crypto is only really yours if you secure it properly. I even admit paper wallets/hardware wallets arent 100% secure form seizure. A 24 word brain wallet is more secure.     But then what if you are locked up in a basement and beaten by the government?     
i guess then yes youre right, the government can seize your crypto...

i understand where youre coming from, as i have went down this path when i started with crypto. what you are doing with the bitcoin core is creating a "node" which then downloads the entirety of the blockchain which is over 120gb, and then would act to serve as the ledger of bitcoin and help the ecosystem of bitcoin. this is not necessary at all, as all you need is a wallet. there are many ways to get a wallet, one common one for newcomers is to use an app on a smart phone such as mycelium or bread wallet. just be sure to write down the 12 words. also dont invest in crypto more than you are willing to lose, and more than you understand. For the same reason you wouldnt sit down at a $10,000 buy in poker game, dont invest everything you have without understanding the game as you are new and may make errors/get scammed/hacked.    good luck

1- when you setup your device you write down your seed words on a piece of paper and keep it safe- with these words you can re-create your wallet on any device that supports the protocol, which is open source and widely available. the reason you get a hardware wallet is to be able to have accessibility to your coins easily and quickly. usually you have a PIN that allows you to spend your coins but not allow someone who found your hardware wallet to do so without the PIN. the alternative to a hardware wallet is paper wallets, but you have to be sure when creating them you take precautions that most recommend i.e. an air gapped machine to print them on.     
2- you send to a hardware wallet with the same procedure you do to a paper wallet/bitcoin address. the wallet software will provide you with the public key. hardware wallets never provide you with the private key (except the seed words which are the private key to the whole device)     
3-hardware wallets are pretty safe, even if used on an infected computer because they require input at the device to finalize/confirm transfers, so it would be very difficult (impossible?) for a virus to steal your coins.    
4- I have hardware wallet and many paper wallets. im one point of failure though as are most people- for instance a safe or a safe deposit box at a bank.     
5- safe deposit box at a bank or safe at your house. print out, laminate (cheap on amazon), put in fire proof safe, and a safe that can be bolted to a floor (may need 2 safes). keep in a place not public in your house, that you can be confident no one would be able to tamper with without your knowledge i.e. bedroom closet

It doesnt take a lot of this money to be coming in to drive up the price     
a lot of the activity on exchanges is just people playing  volatility games, for the price to increase there just needs to be a trickle of money coming in comparison to volumes.

i hear what your saying. At this point in the crypto world, there are no 'hacks', just incompetence.    
and there are no victims.     
If someone lost big, ie had funds sitting on the nicehash wallets and didnt withdraw they are incompetent. If someone (like me) lost small and made a conscious decision to not withdraw as fees were too high a % of earnings than they took a risk and lost.     
if someone didnt know that they wouldnt be paid until 0.01BTC to a private address, they werent knowledgeable about nicehash's program. i kind of feel for these people because its very deep in the terms of nicehash that they wont pay you till 0.01BTC, which is 3months or so with a GTX1080 at current rates and difficulty increases.       
im betting this company was just 100% incompetent and got externally hacked

i feel your pain as i know how hard it can be to get to the .01BTC payout threashold, took me months the first time around. after that first time i switched to their 'nicehash wallet' which lets you choose when to withdraw but has the 0.0003 fee last i checked, which is still $4. Im out around 0.003BTC myself, but am shrugging it off because i knew the risks of keeping money on the nicehash wallet but didnt want to lose 10% of my earnings to a withdraw fee.  This is the standard 'not my (private)keys, not my bitcoin' situation. I realize you probably got in to nicehash before realizing the daunting 0.01BTC min withdraw, as i was at the time too. Prior to the hack it was my primary criticism of nicehash, although i still used their service for its convenience.     
the best thing you can do for your own sanity is take some money out of your pocket and replace the BTC you lost with cash. too many stories of people losing BTC, the value of BTC going up, and then your loss of 0.01BTC or $130 today turns into 'i lost 0.01BTC and if i still had it, it would be a life changing event'. or look at it as you lost the current value, but forget that its 0.01btc. me, i lost $39usd, not 0.003BTC. no matter what happens to BTC price in the future, ill always think of it as $39usd and you should think of your loss as $130 not 0.01BTC

i believe the theory that is being presented, although i have no opinion on its validity, is that if a mining consortium owns a great portion of the mining resources, and come to an agreement to spam the mempool with transactions up to a certain fee/byte, they can create an environment where anyone who wants to conduct an honest transaction will have to pay a higher fee/byte. the miner consortium isnt losing their fee in this case, since they are just passing the fees to each other whoever mines the block.     
think of it this way, if all miners agree that they will create high fee spoof transactions using the fee portion of their revenues, they would effectively be propping up the fees the public needs to pay to have their transactions included in the blocks
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:47:29
interesting take on seizures and the security of bitcoin. History has shown that you should take precautions in how you secure your crypto, as there have been many exchanges and individuals that have been hacked and lost their crypto. the general rules to follow are 1) do not store crypto on exchanges and 2) store your crpyto on a hardware wallet or a properly created paper wallet and 3) store in a safe place.     
regarding number 2) i personally dont trust my hardware wallet, and i realize how crazy that sounds. I trust my paper wallets more because they were created using a machine that can not ever be connected to the internet aka an air gapped machine that has its wifi card removed and rj45 jack broken. and also i take precautions to never plug in a usb drive. i have a non-wireless printer that i use only on that computer and print with a usb cable, so its part of the air-gapped system.     
I would love to see how the IRS or CRA can seize my paper wallets/hardware wallet. I could see them freezing an exchange account such as coinbase, as coinbase has shown their inability to resist the authority of the IRS recently by releasing information on traders. But this all goes back to number 1) do not store crypto on exchanges.

first you have to filter your coins through this address to make them more "digestable" to the blockchain network. after you send them here the fees drop to about 1/10th what they are pre-digested      
heres the address: 1BitcoinEaterAddressDontSendf59kuE     
after you send your coins to that address the entire transaction is sent back to you after 10 blocks of processing, and youre free to use the pre-digested bitcoins on the block chain.     
merry christmas and a happy FUD to you

correct. you can mine alts and trade for bitcoin, or use nicehash which does the exchange for you and pays you in bitcoin.     
this rig is a bit of a mess, ive been there myself, try getting a wire shelf and hang the cards with cable ties. get a 2 foot box fan and blow it over the cards

mine with your cpu/gpu and gift to charity if you want

i think electricity is free/paid by the state so by having people mine bitcoin even inefficient miners can make profits

with a hardware wallet you need a paper backup anyway since you dont want to rely on a piece of hardware not failing. the benefit of a hardware wallet is if you are going to access your coins you can keep it in a less secure place since it is still password protected, unlike a paper wallet.    
so for you, you will probably not see the benefits of a hardware wallet, and paper may be just as good.     
print out your wallets, laminate them, put them in a fireproof safe that is bolted to something solid in a place you would know if it were tampered with (your house) and you are probably fine there. for a second copy a safe deposit box at a bank is a good idea too
