The reasons given for needing to know who Satoshi is are terrible...because there are no good ones. You don't want the public to know who's in possession of $450+ million in bitcoin, and knowing who Satoshi is would only hurt their legacy: Satoshi is Satoshi and knowing any more would ruin the legend.
Sure, everyone's curious, but it's undeniably better to keep the identity a mystery.

SMTP is mispelled as "SMPT" on your opening page. Sounds nitpicky, but typos make a business look less legitimate.

Honestly, bitcoin isn't a great currency. It's a great asset and a great money transfer system, but inherently deflationary currencies simply don't work.

People have an incentive to not spend money and economic activity stalls. Something like Freicoin would work much better as a currency to bitcoin's asset.

Nope. At least it wouldn't be inadmissible in the U.S. It's only inadmissible if an officer does something illegal to obtain it.
