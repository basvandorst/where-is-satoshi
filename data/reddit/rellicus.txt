You can easily swap for usdt or store USD on coinbase. The only issue is transferring the btc from one exchange to thr other fast enough. Which you would do by changing to ltc or eth then back. Arbitrage is totally possible. You just have to be ready for it.

Pretty decent.

Big chance for arbitrage right now. It's 16888 on binance and 17625 on coinbase. Too bad I'm poor.

Why did this show up on my phone as a notification saying it was trending? 1 upvote and 6 comments, 6 hours old counts as trending now?

Withdrawals/deposits of smaller amounts in order to conceal a larger amount is called "structuring" and it's also illegal in the US. You can't escape the fed.

First rule of bitcoin: 
Don't tell anyone you have bitcoin.
Esit: also what's up with my flair on this sub? I'm bout to hit 1 year....

Yup. All good here too.

One of the best articles I've read. Objective, not overly optimistic, and highlights the overall benefits of blockchain, not just bitcoin.

Listen, I know the people on Facebook, I used to be one of them. My grandparents and, I think, their grandparents are on there. These are not the people who should be exploring crypto technology. These are the people buying bitconnect, getting scammed, then telling politicians they need to regulate the market because they were too dumb to avoid losing their money. I would rather see the dumb money go elsewhere. I have spent a ton of time researching, reading white papers, learning about market effects and trends,  and I'm probably still dumb money. I don't want the chick selling Lularoe and essential oils buying bitcoin because they think it will make them rich.

Liquidity, for now, assumes you want fiat for btc. I feel that, in the future, and as we see more adoption, liquidity will dominantly manifest as goods and services in exchange for btc. Then btc will be able to stand on its own, and the fiat pairings will be meaningless. Then again, we may be 20 years from something like this happening.

In 110 years I won't care what the price of 1 Bitcoin is. Because I'll be dead, Jim. 
Anyways... 1 BTC = 1 BTC even in 110 years.
