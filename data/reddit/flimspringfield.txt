Recently someone submitted a post that a grade school teacher had given respective OP's son a bad grade on Bitcoin because the teachers husband got burned by it.  It was found to be fake because OP's handwriting was the same as the "teacher's".
Guy ended up getting a lot of free BTC tips before someone called him out on it.

Aren't they technically both the same?

Sure but the money is currently in escrow and for the bank to release it they need a small deposit of $1000 USD.
When you are ready let me know and I'll PM you my address.

Geez this is why BTC won't ever hit mainstream!  I purchased 1/2 a BTC via Coinbase as a gamble that it would go up which it happily did a year ago and was able to trade it for some physical products that I then sold on eBay for a nice profit.
BTC is a blip guys.  If I end up being wrong then I will happily eat a pizza with the BTC logo on it.
Bring on the downvotes.

You wouldn't expect the founder of a company to use a competitors product would you?
Edit: If you founded Bitcoin would you be using Dogecoin?

These sound like highly complicated methods to storing BTC.
How is the average person supposed to adopt a system like this?

Now it's debt free money though. He dumped X amount of cash on a property that will appreciate over time.
He can save for a year and buy an investment property which can pay for itself and then some which is also appreciating. 
That's how wealth is made.

15%-20% depending on your tax bracket.

It used to be ING the Capital One purchased them.  ING had great rates.

Besides the "Bitcoin doesn't have counterfeit coins out there" post is all good because it promotes it but posting something against BTC is taboo.
@_date: 2014-08-12 07:43:38
No I haven't but I sold he little that I had a year ago. 
@_date: 2014-07-22 05:42:28
Based on this entire thread:
If you have BTC don't have a fire.
If you have BTC then have at least 10 different backups each with some sort of encryption and hope you remember to push them to an online storage/offline them in a USB that will have to be quadruple encrypted.
Stuff like this turns off people from buying BTC.  You all say it's safe and the currency that will replace all currencies but stuff that's above makes it so cumbersome and impossible for normal/non-techie folk.
Bring on the downvotes for going against the BTC is awesome circlejerk.
@_date: 2014-02-05 20:59:02
Wait whaaaa?
@_date: 2014-08-12 05:34:49
Any reasons for the down votes or just because it goes against the circle jerk?

Any business that is legitimate where you are paying thousands of dollars for a service/product will take a check.

"I was hacked (1170btc stolen)"
Ouch!  In today's dollars (based on Coinbase for 08/12/2014) it's $662k!

So it goes against the Bitcoin is awesome and nothing bad can happen to it circlejerk...got it.

20% doesn't seem like much when you've profited a ton.

No you wouldn't. Losing money you just earned after unemployment will hurt.

Well yeah...direct deposit from checking account to Chase...
For the record I closed my account with them a year ago and went to a credit union.  While I miss being able to easily deposit cash into a very local ATM I don't miss paying the overdraft fees.
And yes I take full responsibility for those fees.  Luckily with my credit union I have a line of credit that funds get transferred from at a cost of $4 per $50 vs $30+ per transaction at Chase.

It's popular to people in this sub only.  Outside of this it's a news story when the price is insanely high ($1000 BTC) or BTC gets stolen in insane amounts.
@_date: 2015-02-23 05:34:18
But people do compare it to the dollar and value it based on the dollar.
So what is he supposed to compare it to?  Polished rocks?  10 pound stones?
You guys yourselves have BTC breakdowns such as Satoshis.

That's one thing I hated about these banks during the recession years.  I had a 25k credit balance with Citi at 6.99%...then they tried to increase it to 14% at which I bitched and argued and they settled for 9.99%.  Then a few months later they said either I take the 14% or the account gets closed.  I told the CS agent that they were borrowing money at the lowest rate possible and they were extorting me for 13.75% on top of that?!  
Fuck them.

I agree with others in this thread that BTC is too volatile right now to just refer to it as the only monetary value.
Also you supercalifragilisticexpialidocious.
