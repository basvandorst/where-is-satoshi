Make it opensource! Honest developers are denied to have any privacy and a chance to profit from their good deeds in crypto! Also hand us those keys from your motorbike and your jacket please, only then you will get much deserved positive attention. Grrrararrrr!
Jokes aside - good job.

Yes and no. Open source is great for those who have knowledge to assert the code. Otherwise you will still have to blindly trust the source. Besides smart person can put backdoor in your open source and obfuscate it so 99% even qualified users won't be able to detect without picking code line by line. Safety is an illusion unless you are VERY VERY good and willing to dedicate a lot of time for looking at every code you run. Yet basic precautions can give you an edge over the most threats and save you hell of a lot of time.

Gray as far as I can see. Just as those trees around you!

I would like to point that 17% decline followed by 17% growth is still nets negative 2,89% ;(

Jeez, don't you people understand that malicious intentions are as honest as they can get! From my perspective all those people piling up to listen for your open ports are perfectly honest in their intentions ;)

This map actually says a lot about what region bets on LN. And it's not China.

If you analyze transactions you can match certain addresses to single owner. For example, with almost 100% certainty you can tell it post factum (after funds leave wallet).  However such analysis is much more complicated and it will take months of hard work before it will produce meaningful results.

Or Tether just lost it's peg and imploding...

This is kinda useless information. 
It is normal to use a new address for every incoming tx. This means that if I own a total of 100 BTC it may very well look like 10 000 of addresses with 0.01BTC unspent balance each. Basically, we can add to this all addresses that have ever had a positive balance and we find out that only ~5% of those addresses have non zero balance right now.

What makes you think hash wars are connected to the BTC price? 
@_date: 2018-07-26 08:39:47
Yeah, Bitcoin is still in that age of it's evolution where anyone can self-proclaim as an expert. You could be an expert. I could be an expert. Everyone is an expert.

This is actually really good idea. Most of things, even very complicated could be condensed to a very short text. I mean they could make it 50 pages with proper explanations and details, but there should be a summary that clearly states the rules. 
Ah... the man can dream.
