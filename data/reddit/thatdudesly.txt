Excited to see these apps back on the App Store. Now the only problem is that i'm a jailbroken iOS user and the minimum ios version of CoinPocket requires ios 7.1. :(
Hopefully when coinbase and other apps become available they require at minimum ios 7 like most normal apps do.

Like people have said, jailbreak your iPhone. The official blockchain app is available there with recent updates to it.

Yeah search cydia for blockchain.

It is important to backup your wallet after every transaction you make. Then again that's a hassle for some so I suggest making a backup every time you send or receive over 1 litecoin or 10000 doge depending on what your mining/trading

Yeah I know but I currently use coinbase which is where I do all of my business bitcoin wise. Hopefully they update their app since I'm using the old version before apple pulled it.

Yeah great share for the community. I can post coinbase ipa if y'all need it.
