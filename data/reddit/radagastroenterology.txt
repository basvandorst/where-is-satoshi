I'd rather get stopped out and miss future gains than lose half of my account in the blink of an eye.
That being said, I won't be fucking with BTC much longer.  I'm taking 75% of my money out as soon as it hits my target (or falls below my max loss) and leaving the rest in because who knows how high it will go.
One of my stops (I have several stops at various prices) should have triggered during the outage this morning and didn't, so I'm done with GDAX/Coinbase.

It's at 16,299 right now.  I think there is going to be huge buying pressure for the next 30 mins after GDAX gets steady connectivity.

You really think that I don't price my stops appropriately based on the volatility?
You really trade something that drops 50% and trades 24/7 without some sort of protection?

A limit doesn't guarantee execution, meaning in a crash you're fucked. 
What's the alternative?

Are you serious?
I've been a futures broker for 12 years. Tell me more.

I bought $500 USD more at $16,400. Then it hit $19,000. Then GDAX crashed.

I've been carefully moving my stops up, since GDAX doesn't have trailing stops for some fucking reason.
I hope they get filled if it comes back up and it's dropped 50%.

I suggest you study up a little more before risking too much.

If accidentally spending an extra $50 scares you, it's not for you.

I'm against it as an investment since I'm  a futures broker and Bitcoin has so many flaws, including huge volatility, but I trade it in the short term. 
It's easy to say it was a great investment in hindsight. That doesn't mean it wasnt a high risk gamble.
Futures are the same way. They are highly leveraged, and therefore volatile,  so they aren't good as a long term investment. Also, they expire.
Bitcoin being traded in other ways, such as futures and on Robinhood, is good for BTC. It adds volume and should bring some stability to the price.  It's still possible to have big moves with high volume, but look at the E-mini S&amp;P futures vs Russell 2000 Futures. More volume brings less volatility for these contracts.

This is a bet. It's not an investment. It's a bet.
