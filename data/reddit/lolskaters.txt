I'm not sure I see the point you're making then. Are you trying to tell me that BTC will only be a viable currency once all other fiat options are obsolete/no longer in existence? 
If I'm a vendor selling laptops in exchange for BTC, I have no idea where my buyers' BTC came from. Once I receive the BTC, I'm going to exchange that BTC for fiat, because, you know, I'm running a business and that's reality. It is going to be extremely likely that if you go back one or two transactions for all of my buyer's, you'll eventually run into a poker/gambling wallet, and all of a sudden the exchange I use to turn BTC into fiat bans me. 
I understand this is a government problem and not a BTC problem, but it's a major roadblock that will have to be dealt with before BTC can become used regularly.

The Cash app did exactly this and banned me for it without any type of warning. Complete bullshit.

Any vendor will need to use a money service business to exchange the BTC into fiat. The money service business is going to ban the vendor when customers purchase goods with ill-gotten BTC, without any consideration as to whether the vendor is partaking in the illegal activity.

If a drug dealer goes into Best Buy and buys a laptop with money he earned from selling drugs - even if this was somehow proven - Best Buy's payment processors are not going to blacklist Best Buy.
MSBs such as Coinmama and Cash App are being over zealous in banning users who aren't necessarily earning BTC through illegal activities, but are simply loosely linked to a wallet that has.

What the *fuck* are you talking about?
The simplistic logic used in your posts is so bad it reads like an onion article.
