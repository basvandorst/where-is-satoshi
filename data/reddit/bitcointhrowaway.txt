Huh, I didn't even release that Blockchain did an escrow type service, but I think that could be really great, and I should probably start to use it. Thanks man!

Ah, a man with a little experience, hmmm... I do like to tip small amounts due to a lot of speculations about the price that Bitcoins could potentially reach, but hey, I might as well give it a go. It will happen sooner or later!

Sure, if you check out  you should be able to find the value out there. Just remember that they are an **extremely** risky business. I was once in them, and I am glad that I pulled out when I did, let's just say that.

Sure, well, AsicMiner don't really give that much away when it comes to long term, as Bitcoins are so unpredictable. I would say that your best bet is [FriedCat]( He is the owner of the shares and will try to keep everyone up to date with all the latest news about new hash rates and prices for the future.

Haha, we have similar names, awesome. Totally agree with the: 


That is a rule that you should apply in any investment. As for the investing back in AM shares, it is tempting, don't get me wrong, but I made my money, so I am pretty happy with that.

Yes, that's the main reason why I would like to do a couple of big tips, even though I am not the most financially secure person, I know that others are far far worse off than I am.

I hate to be "that guy", but rules are there for a reason. I would suggest trying to sell it on [BitcoinTalk](

All right, I shall try my best to fill you in a little bit. First off, mining, well, GPU mining has gone *"somewhat"* down the drain, very few people actually do it as it is not that profitable. But if you are still interested in getting into it, I'll answer your questions. For the first, no, you don't need two different wallets, one is quite sufficient. Your mining pool should give you a pay-out address, that is the address you would like to payout. Essentially, you have two "workers" on the same account, so it's fine. In regards to the syncing, you can either have an offline wallet, which you manage yourself, or you can have an online wallet, which you let a company handle, such as [BlockChain]( If you want, then you do not need to continually keep it up-to-date if you have no intention of using the bitcoins, but it is better to make sure that it is up-to-date as the blockchain is rather large. I personally use Blockchain as I deem them reliable. 
For the second question, you do not need to make a site, go to a pool that is all ready there, such as BTCGuild or Slush's pool. Then my answer to number one will apply whereby you can choose a payment address to put your earned bitcoins into. You just need mining software, I would suggest GUIMiner, it is pretty reliable, one thing that I would suggest is not to make the mistake of entering the credentials, it is always your "workers" credentials that you enter in, and not your account credentials. 
EDIT: Just read the android part, must have skimmed it, just use Blockchain which I linked, that is the easiest, by far.

No, not at all. I am not using this account for anything "illegal" I am solely using it for Reddit, as I don't like to post some things on my other account. This thread popped up whilst I was on this account, so I commented on this one.

Of course, throwaways are the best, right? I sold at around 4.25 per share, which wasn't the worst, I wish I owned a little more that I actually did, but hey, hindsight is a great thing! Also, I wish you the best with the AM shares! You have for sure seen the ups and the downs, and the nice dividends which have came with it all!

Of course it is Bitcoin related, anything to do with the news is Bitcoin related. Syria has an impact on Bitcoin, Cyprus has an impact on Bitcoin, Peru, if it finds out that their money is not being used, could, perhaps turn to the Bitcoin.
