You get interest on the money.  And you get liquid assets as collateral.  Almost all big companies do this all the time, it's called repurchase agreements and it's where you park cash.

You have got to be kidding.
The question is simple - are bitcoins valuable?  If I am in Japan and I take bitcoins without permission from someone else who is also in Japan, the fact that I could sell this bitcoins anywhere is completely irrelevant.
If your argument were true, it would apply to software piracy - but Japan has _stronger_ laws on software piracy than the US.

You can still trade tulip bulbs for currencies, too - just currencies worth a lot less than tulip bulbs were at their peak.
There might be a fundamental value for Bitcoin - but if so, no one knows what it is.  Even if cryptocurrencies are a guaranteed part of our financial future - which seems very likely to me - there's no certainty that Bitcoin is the one, and it seems logical that in the end there will only be one general-purpose cryptocurrency.
There might be fatal flaws we haven't yet uncovered in it, or there might be an already-existing or yet-to-be-created cryptocurrency that has better features - better anonymity, or a payment system, or some feature we haven't thought of yet.

Deliberately arranging your perspective to allow you to claim things that are objectively false is irrational.
Considered as a currency, Bitcoin has the highest volatility of all.  Even by comparison with stocks of emerging disruptive technologies, it's more volatile than all but a handful of them.
@_date: 2014-12-01 17:06:42
That's both a positive and a negative feature.
It gives us freedom, but the reason that bitcoin is far more volatile than fiat currencies is precisely because there is no one backing it.
@_date: 2014-10-11 03:40:45


But why would that happen?  Bitcoin is great for _payments_ - it's not great for stored currency.
@_date: 2014-09-28 23:45:02
Several things make me bearish on Bitcoin.
1. Other securities and currencies can be sold short.  This downward pressure keeps prices realistic.  Bitcoin has no short sellers.
2. Other securities and currencies have fundamentals.  For stocks, you can (crude summary) add up all the assets, subtract the liabilities, account for future prospects, and work out a "theoretical" price.  For currencies, you can do something of the same sort, though it's pretty sketchy.  But what "fundamentals" does bitcoin have?
Don't get me wrong here - I _do_ feel that cryptocurrencies have real value - but that value is precisely as a frictionless, decentralized medium of payment.  But if your primary usage of a cryptocurrency is as a temporary intermediate currency, how much of it do you actually need to hold at any time?  And is that intermediate currency necessarily bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-10-05 14:19:54


Given that Bitcoin has no "fundamentals", price movements are about all you have to go on...

:-( Very sorry to hear this.  Hope things work out for you, it doesn't seem like a good situation.
Everyone else is going to want to get their money out of Tunisia now too.  And bitcoin is a perfect way to do this.
So everyone is going to want to buy bitcoins with Tunisian dinars - and anyone who has bitcoins will not want to sell.  My theory is that he won't find even one one person who'll do this - or if they do, he'll be getting 10% of the nominal value or less.

Why would a large company carry any bitcoin at all?  They get no interest on it AND they are assuming risk for no compensation.  (You say, "There's compensation!  The price might go up!" but the price might just as well go down.)

Walmart is a miserable employer who doesn't even pay a living wage to most of its employees, let alone benefits.  
By doing this, you encourage companies to pay their workers starvation wages - and also to concentrate on producing the cheapest possible goods instead of something a little more expensive that might also last a lot longer.

This argument is completely void.  If you can sell it for money, it has value, and must be dealt with in any bankruptcy proceedings.


Yes.  What possible argument do you have that this wouldn't happen? Courts have been dealing with software and purely digital assets for many decades now, and nothing unexpected has happened.  Why is this any different than, say, the ownership of a computer program?
@_date: 2014-06-21 17:38:41


Which is why we say it's very volatile.  The title of your article is objectively false, and it's false even if you use a log or log-log table to draw your pretty pictures - because if you used the same chart to show any other currency you'd see a graph that was much flatter than Bitcoin.
Don't waste our time.
@_date: 2014-03-30 18:20:47
We've known since bitcoin was invented that if it were successful there would be a day when the last bitcoin was mined - so this is why the bitcoin protocol allows a small amount of bitcoin to be set aside for any given transaction as a reward for people verifying it.
When miners start leaving, expect prominent bitcoin shops to start adding a tiny amount to each transaction to compensate the miners.
@_date: 2014-09-18 20:43:20


Which would make them go down against gold and bitcoin, not up...

I feel you're being deliberately obtuse here.
The "empty Mayo jar" has no value.  There is no history of empty Mayo jars being sold for significant amounts of money.  There are no auctions which feature empty Mayo jars.  There are no empty Mayo jar exchanges that allow me to immediately liquidate Mayo jars and turn them into cash.
If you gave me a bitcoin right now, I or anyone else could turn it into dollars or yen in a matter of moments.


The legal system doesn't have to understand that bitcoins are money to understand that they have value.  It is inconceivable that any first world court would rule that any asset that could be instantly and liquidly sold for serious cash is valueless.  Indeed, Japanese courts seem to take intangible intellectual property values _more_ seriously than US courts.

In that case, you could certainly sue the officers of Mt. Gox to recover your missing assets.  The practical issue is that these officers are almost certainly completely broke right now.  However if you discovered that one of them had gone off with your bitcoins, you could certainly sue them.

Very unclear that this is true - is there a source for this?
Most people I know who have bitcoin buy and hold it, whereas many people I know who have jobs (all paid in fiat currency) spend most of each paycheck within two weeks.  Anecdotes have little value, of course, but it does show that this claim isn't "obviously true".

Pennies aren't legal tender.  The reason is simple - the cost of processing and transport is prohibitive.  $10K isn't really a huge tax bill, but $10K in pennies weighs over two tons.  I don't actually _want_ my tax department spending their resources on hauling around tons of pennies.

Devaluing bitcoin - by reducing the supply?
@_date: 2015-07-05 23:45:00


Sorry to be so skeptical here, but why do you think this to be true?
Bitcoin is volatile. For most businesses and individuals, acquiring risk without corresponding compensation is a poor idea.
There's also the liquidity issue - which is has two parts.  For individuals, 99.99% of the people on Earth can't take your bitcoins under any circumstances.  Quite possibly this will change in the future, but basing your investment strategies today on a hypothetical that might not ever happen seems unwise.
For financial institutions, the liquidity issue is that it takes a sizeable bitcoin transaction minutes to "clear", whereas more conventional systems take milliseconds.  This should also improve in the future, but it seems extremely unlikely we'll ever see sub-minute times to clear, let alone subsecond times...
And honestly, if the shit really hits the fan, bitcoin will be worthless, because there won't be much internet.  I honestly believe that US $20 would be likely to retain more value than bitcoin...
Don't get me wrong - bitcoin in specific and cryptocurrencies in general are amazing advances, but absent any theory as to what its fundamental value might be, I wouldn't recommend bitcoin as a form of stored currency.
@_date: 2015-07-17 14:27:31

Gold has a multi-thousand year history of value.  Even though it fluctuates and there's a non-economic component to its price, there are very few places and times in human history where a lump of goal wouldn't have value.
Bitcoin has been around only for a few years, and not even 0.1% of humans have ever owned any.  It's not unreasonable to expect quite a long period of fluctuation while humans decide exactly what a bitcoin is worth to them.

What is this thread - "Who can tell the most whopping lies"?  
[Here's]( a graph of the estimated dollar value of daily bitcoin transactions.  There are spikes up to $350 million, and it averages around $100 million.
Let's compare with the CHIPS network, [which averages $1.2 trillion a day]( - that's _12,000 times as much_ as the whole bitcoin network. (And I picked CHIPS at random, I have no idea if it's even the biggest...)

Gosh, so many wrong things I don't know where to start.
First, Moore's Law talks about the number of transistors in a dense electronic circuit - which has nothing to do with the speed of data transmission.
Second, this is a short distance communication method - the article says 3m - and the data is transmitted through light, so it has to be line of sight.  Both of these make it basically irrelevant for sending the blockchain around.
@_date: 2015-02-23 02:26:06
The issue is simple - no one has the faintest idea what a "fair price" for a bitcoin is!  Lacking fundamentals or any sort of model for it, your guess as good as mine as to whether the correct price is $25, $250 or $2500...
