That fucking sucks. Not too surprised, Coinbase has been shitty lately. Hope you didn't lose too much.
@_date: 2017-12-26 20:06:38
Yea, in that case Coinbase would need to provide the same service that Shapeshift did for me. If they tell you they can't do anything about it they're full of shit, this experience demonstrates that it can definitely be reversed. Good luck!
@_date: 2017-12-26 02:36:23
Not sure why Coinbase would need to help - Shafeshift has the coins and will just return them to your Coinbase wallet (although they'll probably charge you a fee). Coinbase doesn't have to do anything.
@_date: 2017-12-14 00:42:49
Fee was $50.

I disagree. I'd be interested in taking 5% of my paycheck in bitcoin. I'm optimistic/bullish for the future, and wouldn't mind steadily "buying" this way instead of through an exchange.

I was at a party this weekend and some guy was talking (bragging?) about how many bitcoins he has in cold storage (I know, wild party, right?). I was just thinking, "Well, that's one way to set yourself up for a home invasion and have your passwords tortured out of you."
But to answer your question, no, I'm not aware of any specific cases where that's happened.

Hello, 
I do understand your concern however, Amazon.com does not comment about rumors or speculative news reports. 
First, I would like to thank you for your ongoing support and continual purchasing throughout the years. Your purchase history is outstanding and I would personally like to keep your patronage. You are certainly the type of customer that we would like to retain. 
Further, I've forwarded your message to our concerned team in the company, and they will want to know about your feedback. Customer feedback like yours really helps us continue to improve our store and provide better service to our customers. 
However, I can assure you that we have not announced Bitcoin to use as a payment method yet. 
Thanks for taking time to offer us your thoughts but I'm sorry I can't provide any additional information. 
We hope to see you again soon.
Best regards,
Uddesh G

You really think someone would do that? Just go on the Internet and tell lies?
@_date: 2014-10-21 16:18:02
I enjoy explaining the advantages and subtleties of Bitcoin to the uninitiated. With my background, I think this best translates into a PR role. I love seeing the "a-ha!" moment when someone glimpses the possibilities.
Due to the small number of Bitcoin jobs posted (and the fact that they are subsequently lost in the noise) of job boards like Indeed, I tend to visit company pages directly to see what is listed on their career sections. This undoubtedly leads to missed opportunities, since I'm sure some smaller start-ups that I am unfamiliar with are listing positions that are flying under my radar.
@_date: 2014-01-31 16:28:45
If these are the four biggest problems with bitcoin then we don’t have too much to be worried about. If the author wanted to write a scare piece  they should have done some more research. 
Easy to lose? It’s in its infancy, improvements like Trezor are coming and more innovation will follow. 
You have to pay taxes on bitcoin? So what? If anything, that tells me that it’s gained enough legitimacy. Why should bitcoin fall outside of the law?
It’s not anonymous? Again, so what? I’m not buying drugs or weapons online anyway. And if you really want to hide it, you can. That can address the taxes issue as well. The fact that the blockchain is public is a selling point, not a scare tactic, you knucklehead.
The only thing that is somewhat valid with is the threat of a 51% attack, and they missed the point with that one as well. It’s not the existing miners that are worrying (they have a vested interest in the success of the currency, and an attack would destroy trust and cause the price to plummet), it’s more like banks/governments taking control, and that’s unlikely.
@_date: 2014-02-02 20:53:41
Whoa man, that's pretty racist.
@_date: 2014-06-18 13:32:25
They can issue it, but it doesn't make Bitcoin any less or more decentralized/centralized. The blockchain remains the same, no matter who "issues" it. They still need to mine it or purchase it, it's not like they can magically create bitcoins.

I love this. I would absolutely contribute to devs working on problems and creating features. I'm sure there are already ways to do so, but a platform like this sounds organized and transparent.
For example, I'm extremely interested in the idea of sidechains and will happily give what I can as an incentive to see it come to fruition. I really hope that this project continues to take shape.

Could you share it via Google Drive or something similar? 
@_date: 2014-06-18 20:59:59
That's what I'm saying. If a country replaced their currency with BTC they would need to play by the blockchain rules, as opposed to what organizations like the Fed do with "normal" money.

Hi Gavin. Thanks for everything that you have done and continue to do for Bitcoin, you’re the man.
My question: How would you recommend that someone like myself – who understands the Blockchain and Bitcoin but has zero programming ability – become involved? I have a marketing-communications and journalism background, and I’ve applied to some of the larger companies without success. I know that I’d like to structure my career around Bitcoin but am at a loss for how to proceed.
@_date: 2017-02-28 04:39:05
k, cya. good luck. 
@_date: 2014-10-22 19:53:12
Thanks, the Bitcoin Foundation is an excellent suggestion. I'll add them to my list and keep an eye on their career page.
And you're absolutely right, there is a gap where a website serving that purpose should be. I'm not sure that the demand is there currently, but I wouldn't be surprised to see something pop up and fill that need as the space continues to grow.
@_date: 2014-07-02 15:13:42
Ask people who had their coins stored on Gox wallets.
I'm glad to see Coinbase implementing this security measure, it looks like a great feature. But, like has been said many times before, if you don't have control of your coins then they don't truly belong to you.
@_date: 2014-05-21 14:32:00

I use Keepkey, but think there's a lot of room for improvement and more competitive pricing for hardware wallets. I feel a lot safer since switching to it, though.
@_date: 2016-06-02 17:37:30
Don't worry about it, they're not scams. I personally am not a fan of altcoins and have only ever held/used Bitcoin, but there's nothing wrong with hedging your bets and trying out some other coins. If I was going to choose between Dogecoin and Litecoin I'd definitely take the latter, though.
If you have any more questions about wallets I'd be happy to answer, but as someone mentioned earlier Electrum is a great vetted and safe option.

This same thing happened to me, but Coinbase support was excellent, and I'm sure they will be in your case as well. In my situation, OK'ing the withdraw from multiple email addresses (multisig) using the same IP address threw up a red flag. I cancelled the withdraw and reinitiated, this time using incognito mode on one of my email addresses. No problem, btc went to main wallet and then into my Keepkey.
EDIT: as said, wait for Coinbase before you try anything, I don't want to be responsible for wiping out your fortune.

Newegg accepts Bitcoin, scrap that PS4 and build yourself a monster gaming computer. Ascend, brother.
@_date: 2016-06-03 16:05:06
It's a bit intimidating the first time you do it, but you'll see it's not too bad. 
Test it out with a little bit of btc before sending your entire amount. Note that (as far as I know) you won't be able to send just a portion out of your paper wallet, when you send you need to sweep your entire wallet (I'm sure someone will correct me if I'm wrong about this). But you can always send more to it. Do the paper wallet option at bitaddress, not the brain wallet. 
If you google 'how to create a paper wallet using bitaddress.org' there will be plenty of tutorials.
If you have any questions I'm happy to answer, I remember asking the same thing myself here a few years ago.
EDIT: as other people mentioned, Electurm is a great alternative too. All you'll need to do is keep a computer generated 12 word seed safe and you can then erase Electrum and access your btc anytime you reinstall using that seed.
@_date: 2016-06-13 12:50:43
@_date: 2016-06-06 17:25:52
Understood that you would be freaking out, especially given the negative climate towards Coinbase in this sub recently. I've bought my coins from them for a long time, though, and honestly I've always been pleased with their service. 
@_date: 2017-08-19 04:17:18
I'm not saying this is bad info, but I've also never heard of this Exodus wallet. I'd do some more research before moving anything. Could be 100% legit, but I don't fuck around with large amounts of Bitcoin on unknowns. Maybe someone else more in the know can provide a bit more background? 
@_date: 2016-06-03 16:35:30
Definitely. The more I think about it, there are really a lot of opportunities to fuck up using paper wallets. Something like Electrum or Armory are probably better options for beginners. 
@_date: 2016-12-30 17:42:06
Yep, definitely went through: 
Does that amount of BTC listed there of .0049 (about $5) match what you tried to send?
As others have explained, the only way that you can have access to it is if you have a backup of that wallet somewhere, or if you wrote down the 12 word seed from the wallet. 
All-in-all, sucks to lose money, but definitely better to make a mistake this size than one worth a fortune, which I've seen happen! 
@_date: 2016-12-30 14:17:45
What was the public address (**not** your private key, but it sounds like you don't have that anyway) where you sent the coins? It's odd that you didn't get (or maybe just don't recall?) a 12 word seed to make a backup from Mycelium, so just want to check to make sure that transaction actually occurred.
@_date: 2017-11-26 15:51:39

@_date: 2019-12-18 21:45:27

@_date: 2017-11-29 21:22:53
Some people expect it to drop more. Others don't. The thing is, nobody knows. If they did, they wouldn't be posting about it on Reddit. If you want to buy in, buy in now. If you're holding for an extended time it's not really going to matter if you bought now or 10% lower or higher. Look long term.
@_date: 2017-11-03 03:02:23
Don't beat yourself up for not buying in the early days, what's done is done. Everybody (pretty much) wishes they'd bought more at this point, in retrospect it's easy to kick yourself. I waited until 2013 even though I knew about it and considered purchasing a few thousand dollars worth the year before. If you believe in the underlying technology continue to buy-in responsibly when you can, dollar-cost-averaging what you can afford monthly.
@_date: 2015-07-13 13:06:15
Yea, I think you can set a delay of up to 3 days or something like that when you want to move coins from the vault and it sends you text messages and emails letting you know it's in motion. Bad if you need to move BTC quickly, but good for peace of mind.

Can I get an ELI5? How is this different from an escrow system ? I guess I'm not understanding how this is zero-trust. Using the example on the bitcointalk post in which he paid for a Soduku solution, what's to stop the seller from sending gibberish once the payment is made? Wouldn't you need an arbitrator to verify the information before payment is released?

You're absolutely correct. Thought-leadership is one of the core pillars of PR, and a way to position oneself (and by proxy the organization you work for) as experts via a media-provided soapbox. This validation by third-party independent media sources is, compared to traditional advertising, more cost-efficient and (some would argue) more valuable. Dude wants to be on the CNN/FOX/CNBC shortlist of Bitcoin experts.

I'm not worried about the strength, it's 15 words in several languages (some nonsensical words as well) with numbers and capital letters.
I just want to check it to log in to the private wallet (I realize this is probably incorrect terminology here) to make sure that the password works. But by doing so I'd be exposing myself to anyone watching my computer. Does that make sense?

You hit it on the head with this: 


I believe in Bitcoin's future, but it isn't ready for prime time. Too difficult to do things like cold storage for your average Joe. Once the process is streamlined and there are reliable and easy to use wallets and POS available then the more the merrier. I'm fairly comfortable with tech and I often feel like I'm in over my head the way things stand.
@_date: 2013-12-17 04:00:39
Well that's simple enough. So the BIP38 layer of this will keep it secure? I suppose I'm as worried about bitaddress.org (I have no idea who runs that website, hence my hesitation) having access to my wallet as I am of malware/keyloggers/virus/etc.
@_date: 2013-12-17 04:07:07
Right, I did that. Downloaded the page to an offline computer (booted up a Ubuntu thumb drive). But I want to test the password. Without being online. I don't understand how it's possible to test it *without* being online.
@_date: 2013-12-02 22:43:48
Once the paper wallet has been created can you check to see how much BTC you have on it safely and easily?
