There's not much that can be done aside from the implicit threat of the pool being DDoSd all day. We saw the latter to a limited degree with Ghash last summer. There's also the notion that approaching majority hashpower is like killing your cash cow, and so mining pools don't want to do that.

Exactly. All that differs is the price and place of purchase. Circle and Coinbase are both easy to use and fully insured against theft, but they hold onto your private keys if you choose to keep your bitcoin with them. If you want to try your hand at being your own bank and holding your own private keys yourself, then you are of course welcome to, but I would advise in favor of leaving your bitcoin on either Circle or Coinbase until you learn a bit more about keeping your bitcoin secure independently of a 3rd party.

Hey, that's some pretty slick integration! Thank you for accepting bitcoin! If you'd like to get involved with the community I'd suggest that you start reading and posting here regularly. is a lot like the alien cantina from Mos Eisley. You'll make a few connections, but tread carefully because there is a lot of intrigue and nastiness going on too. Also, this community can be extremely critical towards anything they perceive to be at odds with the political leanings of Satoshi Nakamoto, so be very explicit and careful when considering how anything you post might be interpreted.

If the similarities are limited to the intensity of fervor, then I don't know if evoking the term "ponzi" really helps your argument. I also don't know if I should take you seriously.

Correct. If you buy at a certain price and then the value of the bitcoin goes up / down and then you sell you will make a profit / loss. Warning: Trying to make money from bitcoin this way has made a lot of people very unhappy.

Don’t you see the danger, in what you’re doing here? Bitcoin is the most awesome power the planet’s ever seen, but you wield it like a kid that found his dad’s gun. I’ll tell you the problem with the scientific power that you’re using here. It didn’t acquire any discipline to attain it. You read what others have done and you took the next step. You didn’t earn the knowledge for yourself so therefore you don’t take any responsibility for it. You stood on the shoulders of geniuses to accomplish something as fast as you could and before you even knew it you had it. You patented it and packaged it and slapped it on a plastic lunch box, and now your selling it! You wanna sell it! Well, your scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could they didn’t stop if they should. No, hold on John, this is not an animal wiped out by deforestation or the building of a dam. Dinosaurs had their shot and nature selected them for extinction.
