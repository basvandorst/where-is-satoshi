I'd say to download a wallet on your phone and try with that but since there's a problem on the sending side I'm not sure it would fix anything.
@_date: 2016-04-27 12:59:57
Well the latest version of bitcoin is 0.12.1 
Maybe it's past time you upgrade your client.
@_date: 2016-04-15 12:45:28
Maybe you could try to export the key of the rushwallet and import them in some other wallet.
@_date: 2016-04-15 12:40:13
in the Menu Reporting/Realized and Unrealized Gains you should find what you're looking for
@_date: 2016-04-27 07:17:06
~~Any estimation on when the new wallet will be release?~~
Edit: Scrap that, I got my answer with some basic reading skills on your term page

You're paying a much higher price than if you bought at an ATM

- Yes. I did it with mycelium on my phone and tablet using the same seed
- Don't know, but unlikely
- Yes, since it's a deterministic wallet, the adresses are generated in the same order
- Never had any problem personally
- If one of the device is locked somewhere secure, maybe. But you'd better write the seed on a paper or a cryptosteel and put it in a vault.

For the same reasons that if you had cash in a bank vault, you'd first have to move it to your wallet or to your regular account in order to be able to use it.
As far as I know, a coinbase vault is like a cold storage, it's not connected to the trading platform and you first have to ask to make it available in your wallet.
@_date: 2016-04-08 08:48:21
i'm using Mycelium with Trezor and the seed are saved on Cryptosteel
@_date: 2016-04-13 20:24:10
Juste covered my account (investor) to the new login a couple of hours ago and didn't have any problem.
@_date: 2016-04-08 09:35:26
It's something coming in the next months. The wallet is not implemented yet.
@_date: 2016-04-05 14:02:25
Or if you want something a bit more fun looking there's the bitcoin piggy bank
@_date: 2016-04-14 22:16:22
[Cointracking]( is pretty good. That's what I use.
You can import your trades from a lot of exchanges.

Get affiliate links at bitcoin dice casinos and make your friend gamble all their life saving on them :-P
@_date: 2016-04-15 08:24:10
Have you tried contacting rush wallet?
@_date: 2016-04-14 10:30:45
It's been just a month and so far and my return is 2.5%. 
It was 2.9% yesterday but I guess someone just won a decent amount recently :-)
@_date: 2016-04-10 20:38:02
anywhere on the app where you have access to the general settings (the 3 dots), click on backup put in your pin (if you've set one up) and wait for the 60sec so you can reveal your seed again. 
Write it down, save it in multiple safe location, use it to restore your wallet on another phone...

All the electricity is used for mining, better use a car that run on gas.
@_date: 2015-12-10 13:21:24
pretty sure he lost access to the adress :-)
@_date: 2016-03-04 12:49:40
To answer the second part of your question. The amount in $ showing in your wallet will vary depending on the price of bitcoin at the time.
The amount of BTC won't change but the value in $ will fluctuate with the market.

First google result for me is the official website .org
No sign of the scam wallet

There are a few Bitcoin dice casino that let you invest in the bankroll and pay you out of the house edge.
@_date: 2016-03-25 15:07:41
Too bad, I just ordered a Trezor yesterday.
The old price clearly was what kept me from buying a Keepkey before.
@_date: 2016-03-24 12:52:55
At least they were smart enough to seek a second opinion.
@_date: 2016-03-22 15:19:57
I've a mining contract with genesis and I have 2 things to say.
Their support is really good and fast to reply to ticket.
But i'll never mine back what my contract cost me unless the hashrate drops dramatically in the next few weeks.

Will we be able to group pics in albums at some point?
@_date: 2016-11-30 15:25:57

@_date: 2016-12-22 16:58:40
There is an app for that

Possibility of having simpler bitcoin logo
Like [this one]( for example
The logo on your donation QR code is barely visible at that size
@_date: 2017-10-12 11:27:55
You should have replied "you're not doing anything with bitcoin, I am."

Seems to be working in Belgium though my daily limit is set to 0€. But I was able to add a credit card

The basic bitcoin wallet
There might be others but I don't know them
@_date: 2015-09-30 15:25:45
and that's why I have both :-)
@_date: 2015-09-04 14:46:20
From the Xapo FAQ:
*"Xapo takes additional measures to protect your privacy by pooling wallet addresses. By doing this another person will not be able to see how many bitcoins you have in your Xapo account and the transaction history associated with it. On the other hand, your Xapo Vault address can be viewed in the block chain and has been done this way so you can be sure they are not being moved or used without your permission."*

Maybe he just lost the keys to his wallet?
@_date: 2015-11-04 14:05:43
I use mycelium with ledger unplugged for more protection
@_date: 2015-11-04 12:13:58
You shouldn't use green in your logo if it's not accepted.
@_date: 2016-05-20 07:09:19
Got the same one this morning
@_date: 2016-05-20 07:17:56
Thanks, couldn't find it on the first page so I preferred to post it ASAP :-)

Don't know, there's been enough bitcoin website hacked that our email might have been part of stolen data.
@_date: 2015-10-23 10:16:49
Hello fellow belgian :-)
If you're looking for a bitcoin ATM, There are 2 in Antwerpen and 1 in Gent. But if, like me, you don't live close to those two cities you're stuck with online exchange.
Though you can buy bitcoin with Coinbase and your credit card. Just don't leave your bitcoins in any online wallet/exchange for any longer than necessary.

Nice game, could be very fun but it's very confusing how the game adds up bananas earned.
[I have no idea how you count bananas](
@_date: 2016-05-20 07:07:29
Sweet, I'm still enjoying the game but I'd like so much a let go button in fly by mode.
@_date: 2015-10-06 12:59:30
there's quite a few
in no particular order

What's the difference with what you can already do on Poloniex?
