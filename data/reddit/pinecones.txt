I have just submitted a purchase order through this site and paid by Bitcoin :) Thanks for having this option available!
Have you had many people use Bitcoin as the method of payment recently?

Logged in to upvote because of Thomas the tank engine :)
Nice work on the interface too, I'd be happy to use something like that to get sloshed :D

Some solid life advice passed on from my father was to that effect; "With gambling, only bet with what you're willing to lose". Now you can take that literally, but I also apply it to other parts of my life. 
Speeding, you're gambling that you can do so without getting caught, I'm not willing to lose money or my licence. I refused to speed, even if you're right up my ass. 
You can apply it to bitcoin too (I recommend you do). Just didn't want people to miss the scope of the advice. :)

If you have a new chip, board and/or heat sink config you want to test, why would you create more than one prototype?
ASIC-J (first post of his about halfway down) gives some potential insight in to delays. Further in the thread he explains their potential R&amp;D process, trial and error to some degree. 
Perhaps I'm trying to convince myself they're not a scam, but it doesn't sound like they're bathing in my money.
I imagine R&amp;D can be a large undertaking but not necessarily a large operation (too many cooks spoil the broth).

Really? How do you justify the shipping? I looked at some items, in my cart they go. As I head to the checkout, the price had doubled.. it's worse than buying posters from Amazon (when they're on special) :P
