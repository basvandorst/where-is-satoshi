  Anytime!
  Provided that the company in question is reputable (a bank, etc) then this may very well be legit.  
  Also (to further help relieve some anxiety):  most major credit cards are insured against fraudulent activity (indeed, one of the major selling points for using a credit card in the first place).  
If you choose to not cancel your card, just monitor your transaction history and keep an eye out for anything suspicious.
  Good luck!

Bitcoin is no longer able to be mined with just one GPU.  
If all you have to mine with is a GTX 1060 3GB, I would recommend mining other ICO coins such as Zcash, Ethereum, Monero, etc.  
  Depending on the coin that you want to mine will also make a difference in what software you are using.
  To get started, I can recommend using  to mine Monero.
(You will need a Monero Wallet which you can obtain from here  ).
Finally, solo mining with low end equipment realistically is not going to give you a consistent enough return to offset your electricity usage (and hardware cost).  The solution is to mine in a pool.
Monero has a comprehensive guide in their "Get Started" section which includes information about pools.( )
Lastly, if you are are not interested in generating a profit and simply wish to help support the network, then yes you can technically mine bitcoin (again, you will NOT be generating a profit and ONLY be contributing to the stability of the network) by running what is known as a "full node" yourself and donating some bandwidth!
  Note:  It will take a considerable amount of time to download the entire blockchain (150GB+).
You can get started here    .
  If you are interested in simply purchasing some Bitcoin or other cryptocurrency, you will need to access an Exchange.  The easiest exchange to access for Bitcoin is known as Coinbase.  Caution:  Please do your own homework on which exchanges you choose to do business with prior to making any purchases or investments.
  Best wishes and I sincerely hope that this helps!

The Monero client can be downloaded and installed from the Monero website.
For those whom do not wish to run a full Monero client, hosted Monero accounts are also available.
A hardware wallet is also in the works.  You can check the progress/status of this project here:

 fyi I have used the GUI version on Ubuntu 16.10; worked great at first but for some reason now the daemon fails to start..  (Haven't looked into it as I went back to using monero-wallet-cli )

  Did they ask for a credit card as a form of ID?  Im assuming you sent a photo of your card ("blur out numbers")?
It depends on your level of trust for said company.
Best advice I can give you is that if you are concerned about id theft/fraud etc, cancel the card.
(This does sound fishy to me, though I have never experienced a company asking for a photo of my credit card as proof of identity, so not sure if this is common practice or not.  Again, if you are in doubt, cancel the card.)
