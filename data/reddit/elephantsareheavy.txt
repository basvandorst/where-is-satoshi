I do personally believe (based on some facts) that bitcoin will (continue to) be the king of all crypto's. As long as it will be kept sufficiently decentralized. 
Big miners can add lots of hashing power (because of the current profitability and huge ROI's) and as such centralize big portions of the network. This will become an issue when several big miners can form an alliance and gain full control (51%) of the network. 
Keep in mind that this is a completely unregulated market, there are no laws or governments preventing monopolizing and protecting the end users. This lack of governance is both a blessing and a potential pitfall.

Yes  the technology will stay. Napster was the first free content downloadservice, completely gone and now people use torrent. The peer-to-peer tech survived, not the first p2p service. 
Buying bitcoin could be like buying a bit of napster. On the other hand, it could be like buying some netflix shares around the same time too. Nobody knows what bitcoin is going to do, its probably going to be around for a while, but at what value. 
The blockchain technology on the other hand is here to stay!

Currently, bitcoin is in a high adoption phase, and will probably stay there for (a couple of) years. The price will increase. There are already notions of people getting in early, and retiring now as multi-millionaires, they are net-sellers currently. We will not see the same increases, but one persons moon can be another persons entry point. There will be seller, nobody is holding. People are just holding because they did not reach the goal they considered attainable in the beginning of their investment. Others are selling, but sitting on huge piles of money. Honestly, if I would have the equivalent of life savings in bitcoin, I'll stop accumulating, and start selling. I don't care at that point, I'm settled. These points are different for everyone. At the moment it is not used as a currency, but very much as an asset on its own. As soon as everybody 'wants' bitcoin, it will get used more and more as a medium of exchange. The on and off ramps now are quite a bad users experience, ideally we will not need those any more in the future (a couple of years probably). 
Taxing bitcoin is a complex question. IMHO it should be taxed in the same way as a savings account. Because it is not an income producing asset, and it is not (at its core) an investment. You could call it speculation or gambling...
It is also extremely difficult to link wallets to identities, if the people do not want their identity to be revealed, so enforcement is practically impossible. Bitcoin is borderless and does not have a central authority.

All good in theory, and you are right. But even now, when there are -arguably- nerdy early adopter into bitcoin, highly motivated and generally more intelligent people, we still see that a huge amount of bitcoin owners choose to keep their coins in a custodial, centralized wallet...
What is true, is that you have the option to exit the financial system, and you have the option to transfer money without third party and you do not need permission from the government to do so. 
Like Andreas says, the key market where bitcoin can make the difference in a very short time is international remittances. Certainly in south america, and several african countries. Do not underestimate the effect that will be caused by their relatives in western countries suddenly sending 20-30% more money, because there are no fees. 
There will not be equality, this is not something bitcoin can do. You can be corrupt independent of the valuta you use to be corrupt, criminals are very creative. The current distribution of bitcoin is less equal than the current wealth distribution in the world. We'll have a couple of people that became rich with their bitcoins, other that became quite well off (a lot of the people on this forum probably). But there will be a relative small redistribution of wealth. The rich families (rockefeller, walton, rotchild, medici,...) have an enormous amount of money. The walton family alone has a capital roughly the same size as the whole bitcoin market cap. Bitcoin has no influence in that, maybe it will shift a bit money around between the poor and middle classes, but there will not be a Copernican shift. It is a valuta, it is a payment option, it is a unit of account. That is the only economical value. If you have a lot of stuff, the unit you measure it in does not matter. If you're rich enough, you care more about capital preservation that putting your money in a relative risky asset class. You can be sure that they probably already have bitcoin wallets that are much larger than yours, but probably only represent a fraction of a percent of their cash holdings. 
I do not think we'll be paying our starbucks with bitcoin any time soon. Visa and starbucks are both making a lot of money of the current system, and the implications to start your own financial branch are huge. Mom and pop stores will be the first ones to adopt crypto payments, to avoid outrageous credit card fees.

So,... By that logic, bitcoin is a bad investment? I fully agree with that statement! It is not an income producing asset. All its value is purely speculative on its future value. Once adoption is sufficient, we will start seeing bitcoin being used for payments in a regular way. Then it will be more usefull than purely speculation, but it still is not an income producing asset! Many people think of bitcoin like some sort of stock, but the fundamentals are different, there is no company or production underlying bitcoin. Bitcoin is the decentralized company and the product at the same time.

Interesting point. 
There is however a huge difference in investing in bitcoin and daytrading/speculating on the price vs using bitcoin as a currency. Everybody that is complaining here is not really using bitxoin as a currency. Once volatility tapers dows, capital gains will become very small and insignificant. 
To be fair; in my opinion the law is clear, influencers have to pay their taxes. If I get a car for my job, I pay taxes on that, if they get a hotel room for their job, there should also be taxes paid on that. The same with tipped staff, they should declare everything. Too bad there is no traceable blockchain for that.

We do now that bitcoin will increase in price over time and we do know that fiat will decrease in value over time. The real question is when and how much? So the best bet we can do, while we still need fiat to spend in a day to day scenario, is put all our long term savings into bitcoin.

Unpopular opinion: Bitcoin is currently a risky asset. The wealthy don't like to take uncalculatable risks with their money. They will wait till bitcoin is stable, or might never invest in it alltogether. Bitcoin is not an income producing asset, it currently has (mostly) only speculative value. The rich invest in stuff that is more certain. They are not chasing the highest possible yields. They are chasing capital preservation and income. They do not care if their wealth is accounted for in dollar or bitcoin or yen or turkish lire. It is going to be a shitton, and bitcoin is just one other unit of account, nothing more. A volatile one at the moment, but too risky to actually take the bet with your wealth.

There is going to be a constant rise, bitcoin is deflationary. That being said, a temporary down is indeed likely in the short run, but you would be stupid to react on market changes. In this way bitcoin is a lot like the regular stock market. Time in the market beats timing the market every time!
With a crash coming up, I'll consider that as a buying possibility as long as that fits within the allocated budget for crypto in my portfolio.

I am saying that fiat is less risky compared to crypto, indeed. Even compared to bitcoin. 


If you look at all the fiat currencies that are currently in circulation, the vast majority had less than 3% year-over-year inflation rate. If you are currently living in Turkey (or another high inflationary example) I would suggest you hold USD and/or EUR to hedge against turkish inflation, those are safer. I also would suggest to invest in income producing assets and not in fiat currency at all. I also would suggest to invest in crypto (Bitcoin). Your asset allocation depends on your risk tolerance, your cash flow and your capital. In either case, fiat is less volatile compared to bitcoin. If you would need your money to buy food for your family, do not invest it in bitcoin, because it can be worth 70% less next week. If you would like to invest your money for more than a decade, you will not be exposed to a short term selling of your asset, and thereby benefiting from the long term value appreciation. This is risk. Bitcoin is risky, bitcoin is volatile. Bitcoin is a solid investment if you will not be forced to sell at a loss because you need liquidity. Fiat is a better investment, because you know up front it will lose a little bit of its value, without running the immediate risk of dropping 70%. If I need to buy food, I would rather have 98ct on the dollar compared to 30 ct on the dollar. If I want to retire in 15 years, I rather take my lambo to the moonrocket. 
But taking a loan and putting it in bitcoin, a very high-risk high-reward kind of situation, not something that is advisable. 


There is no long run for bitcoin yet. And you are not exposed to fiat that has already failed. Be very careful for confirmation bias and cherry picking arguments. The fact that Venezuela is inflating their currency does not mean the US is going to do the same. It is a theoretical possibility and the Donald might take some steps in that direction, however; there is a lot more stability in the USD compared to all the currencies that went under during all of history combined.

A real consequence, no, as long as BTC is going up compared to the USD there is no consequence because currently its not really used as a currency anyway. 
Inflation is "creation" of new money so all the money is worth a bit less because the underlying value is not inherently altered. 
What we are currently witnessing is a combination of a probable overvaluation of BTC and a slower inflation of BTC to the USD.

In the race attack, can there also be a play with the transaction fees? Low fees for the purchasing transaction, and high fees for the double spend transaction, to try and improve the chances the double spend is confirmed first?
That is obviously a technical possibility, but it is still legally considered theft and/or fraud. You're violating the unwritten merchant/customer contract stipulating you pay for the goods/services received. By purposely double-spending your bitcoin to yourself, you don't pay. Its similar to call visa and tell them to cancel a transaction you've done, clearly fraud. You'll probably get away with it for small purchases, but certainly not for big ones where you also left your personal details.

In the first place, just say nothing. The ledger nano S is looking exactly like a USB drive, so you don't have to take it out of your bag, and it will not show up as "dangerous" on the X-ray. This will be the case for 95% of all conditions. 
In the second place, TSA is there for airtravel security, there is absolutely no reason that any kind of money or value is dangerous for the safety on a plane, be it cash or a private key. It could be an issue for border control entering the country. As far as I know you have to declare any money, cash or valuables you carry. The hardwarewallet can be valued at +/- 100 USD and that's it. 
IANAL, but you do not have to give them the password, you don't even have to know the password for the device you're carrying. In the end it is only a 2FA device for a public web service.
Finally, if they decline you entering with it, destroy it and let them confiscate the pieces, it's a useless piece of hardware at that point. The real value for you is in the word seed you remembered or have written down on a random piece of paper you carry on a piece of paper rolled up in a condom deep inside your anal cavity and/or checked luggage. You'll recover the wallet from the seed and file a complaint against the border control/TSA.

There might be some truth in there. Up till now, Bitcoin was mainly upto individual investors. And money is something people speak about at the holiday dinner table (or more with the whiskey afterwards), so it is an ideal time to buy in. We will see changes with the market opening up through classical investment channels, in that BTC will be traded during working hours, and not during holidays. And in bigger volumes, this however will stabilize bitcoin, a good thing for its role as a value keeper.

Embed this in concrete, burry the rock with your seed next to one of the barrels with escobar's money.
Or be normal. Keep a copy of your seed hidden in your car behind some carpet, stamp it on the steel rim of your spare wheel and cover it again with the tire. And keep a copy in a safe in your house. Next to your hardware wallet, you keep with you when you travel, or in your desk drawer at work. Most importantly don't draw attention to it or to your wealth, and you're going to be safe.

There's a statement in the European Union (or it might be the EMU, which does not include Sweden) that considers bitcoin a currency. Therefore, it depends on local capital gain taxation laws. If this 5k is a relative modest amount of your net worth, then this investment can be seen as a "normal" transaction to take care of your wealth, and not a speculative one. If you were in for a long term and not for a short term, it can be that it is not taxed.
But yes, as the person above mentioned, for 100k, it's worth checking with a tax professional. It might be beneficial to cash out a bit this year and a bit next year, to spread your taxable income over several fiscal years.

It's not about quicker, it is about having a more secure return on your investment. For the miner it is net negative to rent out, as you share profits with the investors. The advantage in it is that if the BTC price drops, the investor is still paying for renting the equipement that is now obsolete. This sets off the risk for the miner. Mind you that setting up a mining infrastructure is quite expensive and that you can not ask traditional banks for a loan to invest in cryptocurrency. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:22:01
To offset risks. To increase available capital. I would take a smaller share of the profits, and share it with other investors, for a decrease of the risk. Furthermore, the cost and infrastructure of a mining operation works with a large overhead, which is shared by different investors if part of the equipement is rented out. It is a bit like investing in a private company. You buy a part of the company (stock) and you share a part in the profits (dividends). 
Sure, You will make more money buying the mining equipement yourself, but you will also be on the hook for infrastructure costs. 
If BTC tanks and is worth a lot less, its a shared risk between the cloud miner and the operator. 
If you look at it like this: cloud mining providers work on a % of the mined profits, so the more profits are made, the more they make. This is good for the cloud mining consumers, because they see their return as the part of the mined coins that are not going to the provider. But the provider has all incentive to be as productive as possible.

as long as it stays completely anonymous. You would be surprised how much personal information can be found by reading your post history. Mostly its easy to find out your interest areas, probably your hometown/county, college, educational degree, job area. This combined with in depth searches on other social media might narrow it down to a very small group of people that could be behing your reddit account. 
This is only safe on the surface, but people with bad intentions can find out a lot about you. Be aware of that.

Bitcoin, because of its inherent nature is never owned by anyone. Private keys are owned. A private key does not require a physical item, therefore, it could be hard to seize. The government can, however, make it illegal to us the bitcoin network, make it illegal to use BTC. Would be easy enough to retract licenses of ISP's that do not block bitcoin businesses. You would still 'have' your bitcoin, but they would be worthless to you. It would be a covert operation to sneak out of the country into a jurisdiction that allows BTC, withdraw cash and smuggle it back into the country.

Technically, they can not. 
1) TSA's function is to prevent weapons getting on board (I am simplifying a bit). So, as long as you do not have your private key etched in a 3' longsword, you're not going to be stopped by the TSA. Having a suitcase full of money is no reason for the TSA to stop you. What they can do is inform the border control agents if you're traveling internationally that your luggage is suspicious. 
2) This is semantics, but you could get a point here. Most countries limit you to carry more than 10 000 USD (or something around that range in local currency) without declaring it. Upon declaration, and the satisfaction of the border control agent, you can bring in more. Having a private key on you is not the same as carrying a monetary instrument with you. You only have a small USB token that gives you access to an online service. With that reasoning, a hardware wallet is the crypto equivalent of a debit card. If I have &gt; 10k USD on my bank account, I can use it and pay with it abroad without having to carry the cash with me through TSA. I do not have to declare my bank cards to the TSA (or border control). 
3) The case pictured is a little bit holding the red flag in front of the bull. Don't draw attention to yourself and you'll be fine. They are in general afraid of what they do not understand (like bottled water).

There are always ways around it. There is no reason you would need to pay cash either. If it is a legitimate purchase, there is no issue. In my country, if you deposit more then (the +/- equivalent of) 5 000 USD, you need to declare its origins. 
This is done to avoid a thriving black economy. If you work without contract and are paid in cash, you can not pay your bills through the bank, because you don't have money in the bank. There are always ways around it, but the government makes it harder. This is ultimately to make it harder to dodge taxes, like sales tax or income tax on cash transaction. If money has a paper trail, it can be investigated. All part of the big-brother government. There's some good and some bad about this. For most people, the VAST majority of people, there is no issue, they do not have this amount of money to transact on a regular basis anyway, let alone in cash. If you sell your car second hand, you can still get away with the cash, as long as you don't deposit it all at once, or just spend it over time... I guess they also have monitoring systems in place giving alerts if cash deposits over a year reach a certain limit. They will look into it, it is not by definition illegal, but at least suspicious. Much in the same way as a police officer decides he has probably cause to search your vehicle. No issue if he does not find anything.

The joke comes from having sooooooo much money that you have no idea what to do with it. Sure, there are more sensible things to buy than an expensive car. But if the expensive car does not really affect your net worth (your net worth is HUGE), you might as well buy a flashy expensive race car, and have fun. It is an expression of exuberant wealth. Does not go together with a 70k/year lifestyle, more like 10X that. It would also be cool just to be able to say you "could" buy a lambo, by having the BTC equivalent in your wallet. It does not mean you should buy the car. By all means, its a useless car, has poor gas mileage, terrible ground clearance, bad visibility, limited trunk space, no back seat for banging chicks, etc...

If the deposited money only covers the paid bitcoin, there are a lot of other cost not accounted for. Arguably currently the fees are higher than necessary for cost-recovery, but it can be, due to a lack of competition in the market.
A bitcoin ATM needs to be developed and built, it needs to be placed in a certain spot where maybe rent needs to be paid, it needs a hookup to electricity and internet, which is not free and it needs to be regularly serviced in person for the cash-side of things. All these things are not free and need to be calculated into the price of the product it sells (bitcoin) either due to fees or due to a higher-than-market exchange rate. Or a combination of both. Wanting everything free does not make it economically viable. Would you own a network of Bitcoin ATM's if this means you lose money on each and every one of them?

The moment coinbase goes bankrupt, or gets into liquidity problems or whatever, you will not have the option to transfer your funds from a btc to a usd. Your btc will be lost, your usd will be insured. If you keep it in usd on the account on coinbase, you might as well never have transferred it to coinbase.

You don't seem to understand the concept of inflation. 
So yes, bitcoin is inflation resistant, there will never be a larger token supply than what is written down in the whitepaper and genesis block. 
A market crash is different from an inflationary event. A market crash is when investors no longer believe companies will be able to meet their future financial goals and sell the shares. A companies value has nothing to do with the relative value of a USD, the USD is only used as a unit of accounting for the share price of (US-based) companies. 
Both have nothing to do with bitcoin. The price of bitcoin has nothing to do with its token supply. Bitcoin was developed directly as a contrary reaction to the banking crash (of 2008. You don't have to believe in its perseverance for it to survive. Bitcoin is still here, and its fundamentals are getting stronger. The price point decreased compared to late 2017, but the amount of transactions and the usability of bitcoin vastly increased. 
Yes, users can manipulate the market of crypto. But where does using a market becomes manipulating a market? The value of a bitcoin (expressed in USD) is based on an open market of supply and demand. The monetary value is inferior compared to the use value of a bitcoin token.
If arguments and facts don't change your mind, maybe the future will.

Isn't that the whole point of Bitcoin? Then don't call it money, whatever you want or not want to call Bitcoin, it is means of accounting and value exchange.

User error is user error. CC protects you against fraudulent transaction, but it is also inherently a system where fraudulent transactions are easy and common. In the bitcoin world, you work with the system of 'push transactions' where you as a user push the money towards the receiver, either transaction per transaction, or as a regular payment. With CC, you have the existence of "pull transactions" where, for instant, your phone provider charges your monthly bill automatically. This means the phone provider has all info available to charge your card whatever amount of money. Even if you trust your phone provider to not abuse that power, you also have to trust him not to sell your information, or protect it enough not to get stolen. These problems are inherent with the CC-model, and are non-existent with the bitcoin model.
I agree that some oversight is required for a lot of people. With bitcoin, there is nobody to go and cry to when you fuck up. I personally think this is a good thing, but the (financial) illiteracy of most people make me think this is not the best general idea. OTOH, most people have no money anyway, only debt.

That would be an ultimate life goal. Even at today's prices that is about 84k USD, which is a big sum of money to have invested as a 'normal' person. Certainly given the general advice to not invest more than you can afford to lose, generally crypto is considered a decent investment for 5-10% of your portfolio. Meaning you would have an invested capital of 420-840k. That chunk of money would change your financial life completely. 
@_date: 2019-03-15 05:20:55
So indeed, 100% unrelated to market size. The difficulty is not related to the price or the market cap neither to the electricity cost. It is related to the amount of hashes on the network. Obviously if the expected payout increases, there will be an increased interest to invest in mining equipment. Different miners have vastly different electricity and infrastructure costs. Some miners are willing to mine at a loss (compared to electricity price) and speculate on future value increase. There is no causative effect of bitcoin price on the hashrate of the network. Hell, the whole network could run on one serverroom. The beauty is that due to the open network, it is inherently decentralized.

Apple is the epitome of corporatism. If they are going the cryptocurrency way, it will be with their own proprietary, centralized, token. The out-of-the-box support for bitcoin is not going to be a profit place for them. At the very most I can see them having a BTC wallet on which you can buy bitcoins only via iTunes or their platform, and they promise to keep your private keys safe. 
They will make it easy, they will have a great users interface. It might be a good thing for BTC adoption, but they will make you give up a lot of the freedoms associated with bitcoin.

True, the problem is that in the ATM case, the persons received goods or services without paying for it. That is theft. The way they "pay" to withdraw money is irrelevant, as long as the issuer of money has been paid. If they choose to use bitcoin, fine. If they choose to use a bank account, fine. If they choose to reverse (double spend) the transaction, they choose not to pay, and not paying for services or goods rendered is theft (in this case).
The whole thing has very little to do with bitcoin. Another example often used to discredit cryptocurrencies is their use for illegal activities like buying drugs. Buying drugs is illegal. That is the crime. Paying for drugs with bitcoin is not illegal because of the bitcoin, it is illegal because of the drugs.

Buffet is right about Bitcoin not being an income producing asset. Bitcoin is not an asset. Investing in bitcoin is 'similar' to investing in foreign valuta or precious metals, the only way it is a succesfull investment is if it becomes worth more or the dollar (if that is where you start) is worth less. It is a given, due to inflation that the dollar will reduce in purchase power. 
Buffet's investment style is to invest in companies, which are inherently income producing entities. Using bitcoin of dollar is a matter of having a unit of accounting, buffet does not hold large quantities of liquid money (compared to his whole portfolio, it probably is a lot compared to most mortal souls).

You can do that, bitcoin dropped a bit, chances are it will go up. Nobody knows if it will drop further first, or how high it will eventually go up.
If you can afford to increase your buy, you should in my opinion. But this means you're not longer DCA'ing, you can 'restart' with a higher amount.

Fair enough,...
I always assumed this was only the case the moment a transaction was mined into a block, but two blocks got mined simultaneous and are propagating through the network.

Only when one of the blocks gets a daughter, the other one is no longer the valid block.

with 51%, there's another 49% that will mine roughly half of the blocks. If you don't accept their blocks, which are blocks under the bitcoin consensus rules, you're not following the bitcoin consensus rules (you might follow stricter rules). This means you are still under all the scrutiny of the bitcoin code, you can not pay yourself anything more than the coinbase reward. If you did, you break a rule, and you fork bitcoin. 
If you keep the rules, and reject blocks from other miners, you run the chance of getting ahead with 2% on the other miners, if you're lucky. It also means blocks will immediately slow down, because half of the miners are out of the network (or censored) and the hashrate did not change. This would mean the mempool increases in transactions you're censoring, this means the possible rewards mining these transactions increases, this means more miners would want to grab these rewards, and bam, you're back under 51%, you just spend a couple of trillion $ and have nothing to show for it.

Damn Lies
Statistics. 
@_date: 2019-03-27 16:27:20
Cryptocurrency will never drive the economy. It is only a unit of account and a unit of exchange. 
Your point is that currently, you always have to 'calculate back' to fiat currency, and most places that accept crypto are also converting it back to fiat shortly after. A big underlying factor is the current instability of exchange rates between crypto and fiat. In the last two days, I've been reading on here about "facebook's crypto" and "apple's crypto" both of which will obviously be centralized and governed. This means they are no better than a gift card you can only use in the facebook store or the apple store. The beauty about decentralized crypto is that you can theoretically use it everywhere. 
We will need a copernical revolution in how the economy work, and this will go slow at first. As long as people are paid in fiat, spend money in fiat, and fiat has a relative low inflation rate, there is little to no incentive to throw crypto in the middle of that. This is certainly true in countries like the US, where there is in general good access to monetary exchange instruments. 
This together with the fact that a large group of people has very little (or even negative) savings, and are living paycheck-to-paycheck, so inflation is having no effect on their (nonexistent) savings. Crypto poses absolutely no benefit at this point to that group of people. 
Another advantage of bitcoin can be seen as a problem by many people. There is nobody to go cry to when you fuck up your spending. Just read and realize how many of the problems on there are caused by a centralized intermediary that acts on its own rules (paypal, visa, ...). Or a bank that acts in its own interest. With crypto, you can take power over your own money again, in a way you do not have to stuff your mattress full of benjamin's. 
We don't exactly know where crypto is going, but it certainly is not going away. The benefits for the "man/woman in the street" is going to seem limited, but the freedom associated with it is significant. This is not a problem if you're not limited in your monetary freedom at this moment. Just think about wikileaks, and how easy a democratic government can seem to act like an irrational dictator. Crypto takes the absolute monetary control away from governments. In my opinion, history has shown that governments can not be trusted with monetary control anyway.
At the moment, it might seem like crazy, nerdy, magic internet money. Just think back about the time that email seemed to be crazy, nerdy magic internet letters, and think how important email is nowadays for global censor-less communications. Think how important twitter is for spreading your democratic vote/protest under a suppressive government (Egypt/Venezuela?...).

Ok, technically you're right. 
In a "national currency" it is implied that it is national, meaning under the control of the state. Implied does not mean absolute, indeed. No government would ever do that unless they want to undermine one of the most important assets they have, currency control. Then again, governments often make stupid decisions.

Even if the US government controls the majority of the hashrate, and makes their miners censor certain transaction, they can not take over bitcoin. Other miners will include the other transactions, effectively rendering censoring useless. 
If they refuse blocks from other miners, they changed the consensus rules, and they effectively created a hard fork. It can be that on their forked chain they have more hashpower than the other chain, but still, it does not mean they took over bitcoin.

There is a general consensus among serious investors that crypto should be a part of a well diversified investment portfolio. General recommendations run around 5-10% of your total portfolio.

This is the only solid investment advice. Too many people on this sub do not understand investing and want to moon their lambo or whatever.

You should only sell an investment if you have something better to put in place.

There is a whole ecosystem growing backing the use of bitcoin. The tools and options available now are sooo much better than at the time of the ATH. The technology is evolving, getting incorporated in devices and in mainstream payment systems (slowly). This is what matters. Bitcoin is not dead.

Ideally, in a perfect world, everyone would have their miner running to heat their house. Perfect decentralization. But this means only the person finding the block will have 60k, and everybody else would have nothing. Your chances on 60k are low. However if you go together with your whole neighborhood (100 people), you increase your chances 100-fold of someone winning, and you agree to share everything equally depending on hash power contributed. So you have a much higher chance of winning 600 as a block reward. If you do it with your whole city, 10k people, then you get $6 very often.
But if the hardware needs updating, everybody needs to get a technical installation guy to pass by, or struggles with the software, etc... So it is actually more efficient to pay for your miner, but let some professional host it in a big warehouse for a small amount of the profit. He does the maintenance etc,... and you get the payout. All the miners of your city in one warehouse is actually more cost-effective than everyone running their own. 
This is game theory at work.

Absolutely not. The only somewhat valid argument here is against people claiming that Bitcoin is only used by criminals or for porn. This only illustrate that the banking cartel is the largest criminal organization currently operating, Bitcoin is not a threat to society as a way to transact money covertly, banks are already great at that. Bitcoin "legalization" will not increase criminality substantially (or at all). It still allows for transactions that are done for illicit purposes, but it is certainly not worse than the legacy monetary system.

The government ensures certain bank deposits, simply by promising to dilute the money supply with new money and giving you back the face value of your ensured deposit, not the purchasing power. They basically say, if the bank fails, we steal a bit of money from everyone and give it back to the people that were affected by the bank. I don't know if this is some Robin Hood practice, or some extreme socialism, but the government is not guaranteeing anything, just saying it will force other people (all the people with $ assets, not the ones with only crypto) to contribute.

Nuclear, wind, solar, geothermal and hydro. Transport of electricity is way, way, way more efficient compared to the transport and refining of oil. This is an infrastructure problem, not an engineering problem. 


According to a 2011 study by Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and the University of California, Berkeley, the currently estimated reserve base of lithium should not be a limiting factor for large-scale battery production for electric vehicles because an estimated 1 billion 40 kWh Li-based batteries could be built with current reserves - about 10 kg of lithium per car. Another 2011 study at the University of Michigan and Ford Motor Company found enough resources to support global demand until 2100, including the lithium required for the potential widespread transportation use. The study estimated global reserves at 39 million tons, and total demand for lithium during the 90-year period annualized at 12–20 million tons, depending on the scenarios regarding economic growth and recycling rates.


Define needing electric cars, for survival, probably not... most of our transportation is required for 'wants' not for 'needs'. Carbon emissions is a global problem it is not solved by only changing first world countries, there needs to be a global paradigm shift away from fossil fuels. If this goes towards less ICE cars, this is good. Don't take China as an example for a vision on a sustainable future.

About your last statement... I have been looking for a way to transfer money from Belgium to Canada without having to pay the 50 euro transfer fee. I looked into several bitcoin options, and because of the buy/sell spread and the costs on the on/off ramps into fiat, using bitcoin would have been several times more expensive (i needed to go to fiat). 
I was really dissapointed there was no possibility crypto could do this cheaper compared to the legacy banking system. The real problem obviously is that I needed fiat on both aides of the transaction.

Because you are at the mercy of coinbase to give back your bitcoin to you. 
Coinbase is a honeypot for hackers, with a fortune in crypto sitting on its servers. You are for starters less likely to get targeted with a private wallet. Admittedly, Coinbase probably has a better security. 
Imagine if you have 20k in cash, do you keep it in your pants pocket, do you put it safely in a bank that is government regulated and backed or do you give it do 5 money-hungry nerds that developed a crypto exchange in their mothers' basement? 
The truth is that coinbase is probably a lot safer than this, but if you could keep your funds yourself, why would you not?
Another reason is, when the FBI comes to coinbase, and tells them you are a pedofilic drug dealing terrorist, coinbase will not protect you, and hand over your coins to the FBI, without you having a say in that. (now imagine a government camera in HongKong fucked up and falsely recognized your face, and confiscates all your funds they have access to, because they can,...)

How? In the mind of an uninformed person, a lot is possible. 
While it would take some effort of the chinese government to control bitmain and to control several big mining facilities, it is certainly not impossible. (they probably get started as soon as they control a bunch of students in Hongkong)
But so what? Even if they have 2/3 of the hashrate, this does not make them control bitcoin. They will win the most with mining, they will have a significant proportion of newly mined bitcoins. If they want to do anything else, they will fail and fork bitcoin. 
They can censor transactions (making the consensus rules more stringent than the general bitcoin network), and their miners would not mine any censored transactions. However, there will be other miners, they can not control that, and those miners will include the censored transactions. It are the nodes that include or reject the blocks. If chinese miners decide to reject a block that fits the bitcoin consensus rules, they effectively created a hard fork, again,... If they control the majority of the nodes, AND a majority of the mining power, then there might be a problem.

Nope, the bitcoin has not been stolen, ignorant fools have been taken advantage off. You own bitcoin when you own the private keys to your wallet, if you do not own the private keys, you do not own the bitcoin. 'Stealing' bitcoin from trading platforms is taking advantage of people not securing your bitcoin.
It would be similar as to going to the bank and instead of depositing your money, you make a little pile of your money in the ATM vestibule, with a little post-it note with your name on it. You come back 5 days later and your money is gone.
There is clearly a malicious event, where someone takes money that does not belong to him/her. But the real problem here is blatant negligence from your side. The same is true when you don't transfer your BTC to a wallet of which you (and you alone) have the private keys. Obviously you're never fully safe from the $5 wrench attack, but you can do a lot to make it harder for people to acces your financial instruments.

It now becomes a better investment to put your money in an oil barrel and bury it in the desert in New Mexico compared to leaving your money on a bank account.

Stock market is at an ATH, crash is expected any time, chances are reasonable that the next year will be a negative yield on the SP500 too. 
Investing in real estate takes a huge amount of capital and centralizes a lot of risk. 
There really is no good investment product out there at the moment. Bitcoin might be promising technology and so on, but it is, by definition, not an income producing asset. Any gains from bitcoin holdings are speculative (this is not necessary a bad thing) and will only do so during the adoption phase. After that, the price increase of bitcoin will taper off, and there will be nothing left to invest in...

Yes on the flipping a coin approach. 
You're thinking of security, and will be finely more secure compared to most others. Don't overthink exotic vulnerabilities. Be sensible and responsible and go with it. Have a hardware wallet, any hardware wallet, and you'll be good to go. 
The obvious must be stated: Make sure to write down your seed phrase yourself, if the wallet comes 'preinstalled' report the seller and hit it with a hammer. If you can reach the seller, hit him with a hammer as well. Keep this seed phrase safe and on paper only. Don't keep it on a text file on your desktop. Don't keep a picture of your seed phrase on your dropbox,... Store the paper in the same place as you would store 10k cash in your house or a trusted location. This is so important, the hardware wallet is only as secure as its seed phrase. A good idea is to put the seed words on a paper hiding behind the picture of your favourite pet in your bathroom or something like that. Just a physical postit note behind the picture in front of the frame.

Hmmm, this probably should be standard deviation. Like is common on financial markets. I am also not sure what rethoric OP wants to push with this. Historically, long term holding has given excellent returns. Usually investments with higher volatility perform (on average) better compared to the ones with lower volatility.

No, you need 50% of the mining power to control BTC.
However, if you have a lot of BTC to play around with, you can control the price a bit. Imagine if Jeff Bezos sells his Amazon stock, the price would plummet, so in a way, he controls the amazon stock price. Imagine if Warren Buffet decides to buy shares of Tesla, the share price will skyrocket, so in a way, he controls the tesla stock. But as a person who owns bitcoin (or shares) you're still dependent on somebody else who wants to buy or sell you(r) BTC (or shares). You can manipulate the price, but the market cap of BTC reaches pretty high values, even the free float is significant. There can be market manipulation by big players, but this is the case for everything.

During a recession funds typically flow from risky to more safe investments. As far as you can consider crypto/bitcoin an investment, it is currently a fairly risky one (standard deviation over price) compared to e.g. government bonds. So yes, during a recession the market cap of bitcoin will most likely shrink.
During inflation events (!= recession) funds typically flow towards inflation resistant investments like stock, gold and probably crypto/btc. We still need to see a significant inflation event in a significantly important market to see what happens. My bet is China will be the next to inflate their currency massively, and we might see a decent money influx into the crypto world at that point.

I'm not sure I agree there. Hoarding reduces liquidity and increases price. If that is your goal, sure.

The main power of bitcoin is not that it is digital. The main power is that it is not centrally controlled by a governmental entity, that it is thereby inflation resistant.

There's no idea what address is the change address or the recipients address if you use a good wallet. You can consolidate UTXO's to again, a new address. You can create a transaction with multiple inputs and outputs, hard to trace. You can coinjoin,... 
It all depends on the chain analysis used and the criteria set. If you look at money from my bank account, there is a regular pattern. I spend probably &gt;70% of my money by sending it to non-unique accounts; this means repeat transactions (my regular grocery store, my anal lube supplier,... you get the idea) On the other hand, most transactions I receive are also from non-unique senders (my employer, my regular clients in my heroine business,...) There are people on there, some of my friends, with whom I regularly transfer money either towards them or towards me. Paying back for dinner, concert tickets,... so it's not because this money comes back to me, that it has always been mine and that I control the account of my friend. 
The point I'm trying to make; it's all circumstantial evidence. There might be suspicion, it might be likely, but it can never be proven HARD that I am behind a certain UTXO, you can always only be certain that I am behind one of two (or several) possible UTXO's. If you have the recipient and the change address, and the recipient is fully collaborating with the IRS, it can be known which UTXO was that change address (and obviously where the transaction originated from). If I post a transaction where this UTXO is combined with another one as input, it is highly likely I controlled the other UTXO. If the UTXO is just transferred completely on its own,... there is no way of knowing I was paying someone for something or transfering it to one of the addresses I have under my own control. All you know at that point is that I initiated the transfer of some bitcoin. 
What is a taxable event; a taxable event is when I use it to pay for goods or services or exchange it for another (crypto)currency (basically). As you can not be certain where the bitcoin ended up, so I could still be in possession, it might be that there was no taxable event. 
I'm just saying, it is really, really hard to track stuff. This does not mean you should commit tax evasion. But the reporting and taxation of bitcoin will be largely reliant on the honest collaboration of the people holding the asset.

Yes, there is price volatility. A lot more in BTC compared to the USD. Your federally insured account does not protect you against the government who can, at any point, steal your money by (hyper)inflation. 
Every financial instrument will be targeted by scams etc. Ever gotten a predatory credit card application? Ever got a scammy phone call for your bank details? BTC is not different, there is money to be gained by being dishonest, so dishonest people will try. This is not a negative for BTC. The blockchain has never been hacked, ever. All possible scams revolve around getting you to give or trust the scammer with your private key. The 1% of BTC holders have way less influence on BTC then the 1% of USD holders have on USD. They are filthy rich, why would they bother? 
Yes, dig deep and try to find this guy who used BTC in his financial scheme. I am sure this only happens with bitcoin. No pyramid or miracle investment scheme can be had without BTC. BTC is an inherent part of every monetary scam...
Bitcoin is secure, but only as secure as its end user. The responsibility for lost funds is always, always, always an end user error, often due to ignorance, bad interface, false trust,... This does not mean bitcoin is the one to blame, the same happens with every possible monetary instrument.

The fact that these concepts are not even clear to people using a forum means we are in the very, very, very, low scale of adoption. Reddit users are (in general) already more tech-savvy then the general public, and reading which is not a standard sub, meas you actively look for information etc... and even then they think the 'central bank' will bail them out when a crypto-thing goes wrong. Be your own bank is not a hard concept. This means there is nobody to pay fees too, but this also means there is nobody to go and cry to. People like centralization, because they feel like they are being taken care of, while in most cases they are being taken advantage off without even realizing it. 
There was a post today on where there was a guy who bought a 100$ starbucks giftcard through his bank, and cancelled the transaction but never received the refund. Bank says it is a legitimate transaction (true), starbucks says to contact their gift card processor, they say they never received funds from the bank, etc... I had two thoughts there: 1) Being an asshole and commenting "Bitcoin, yada yada,..." and 2) Man you're fucked, what a mess to clean up. Why can you not pay directly to starbucks. There are like 2-3 intermediaries all somehow getting fees from your transaction. Why does this seem a good idea?

Spreading the knowledge and understanding what you're into is important. But be aware that reading and understanding the whitepaper is not required for using bitcoin. A valid analogy here is that many people are unable to explain how an internal combustion engine works, but they are all still using a car every day. If you want to work with bitcoin, yes, have a look and (try to) understand the whitepaper. If you want to use bitcoin (and are pretty much illiterate on the cryptography/computer field) there is no need to understand anything, or even know about a whitepaper.

There is a difference between a mining firm and a mining pool. While a mining firm usually has a large amount of hash power, and is mining for one account. A mining pool can have a very distributed network of small miners that are in no way financially linked or committed to the one mining pool. Individual miners can 'choose' whichever pool they want to mine in, and can switch mining pools with the click of a button (and a couple of lines of code). 
If 2/3 of the network is owned by one firm, it can never take out the bitcoin network. Not by accident, and not by malice. 
If by accident, their miners go down, then 1/3 of the mining power remains on the BTC network. Assuming no new mining equipment is brought online, this would mean, with the same difficulty, for the maximally next 2016 blocks, the average time would go from 10 min/ block to 30 min/block. So, at the most it would take 42 days instead of 14 days to the next difficulty adjustment. In this period, this would also mean that the average payout for the miners is reduced to 1/3 relative to the operating cost (electricity). This can lead to more miners going offline, but due to the sunk cost of fixed contracts, this might not be much. On the other hand, it can also be that the difficulty is adjusted again much faster, depending on the # blocks since the previous adjustment before the big miner went offline. 
So for that period, blocks will be slow, the mempool will increase, fees will increase, and more miners will be attracted again. Difficulty will adjust downwards, and we will be back at 10 minute blocks within 6 weeks (depending on the block height, it might take two adjustments to normalize). 
If the miner is malicious, and wants to cheat to become rich, what would happen? The miner owns the majority of the hashrate, so they will win the majority of the blocks. This means they will mine more blocks than the rest of the network combined. Game theory keeps the miners honest, so not to complicate things, the 1/3 of the network remains honest. This means they are vetting, controlling, and verifying blocks according to the bitcoin rules written by the bitcoin dev team (independent from the miners) and if the blocks are conform the rules, they add it to the chain and start mining the next block. Nodes to a similar thing, they reject a block if it is not conform the rules, and they accept the first block that is in agreement with the rules. 
The miner can, if he wants to, add a block reward or payout to himself, mine the block and broadcast it to the bitcoin network. He programmed 2/3 of the network to accept this block, and they start mining the next block after the big reward for the malicious miner. It is 2/3 likely he is going to find the next block, and the next block and build on the chain, making it the longest chain and making it immutable. However,... at that point, there is 1/3 of the miners that rejected the block with the false reward, because it is not according to the consensus rules, a valid block on the bitcoin network. So one of the honest miners finds another block, and adds that to the chain. 
What happened now? We have a fork. 2/3 of the network is mining one fork and 1/3 or the network is mining another fork. Because of the bad transaction, and the bitcoin consensus rules, the 1/3 would be the bitcoin blockchain and the 2/3 would be some other blockchain, forked from bitcoin, with different consensus rules to include the malicious transaction. So we are basically back in situation 1, where 2/3 of the mining power disappeared from the bitcoin network. 
The forked blockchain with the one miner will probably be quite useless, because it is not a fair decentralized game, it is a rigged game, so nobody else will want to play if they don't get a fair chance on a payout, and by that,... it's over. Big miner spend a couple of millions on performing this operation, and has nothing to show for it, so all he can do is put his miners back on the bitcoin chain to mine there, and abandon the forked chain where they paid themselves.

Yes, but mining solo has such a low probability of a payout that it is amost not worth the investment. Mining pools allow smaller miners a reasonable rate of income. It is hard ti invest in equipment etc and then get a one time huge payout if you find the block in several months.

Keep in mind that it took a long time for bitcoin to become what it is today (and there is even more to come in the future). This timeline is inconsistent with a quick money-grab game played by institutions, however, they do like the long-con to. But even if they created it, control over bitcoin is out of their hands now, that is kind of the whole point of a decentralized ledger. Whoever created it does not matter, it exists and that matters. Nobody can control it, nobody can steal it, nobody can, even not the 'putative' creator(s) of BTC. If the central bankers did create it, they did their job well in providing financial solutions for everybody. This makes it even more unlikely that bankers created btc.

Once I have enough crypto accumulated in a way that the IRS will start to worry about the gains, I probably will be living in an exotic country, where I let my lawyer deal with this. Honestly, jail is for the poor. If you're rich enough, the IRS will not jail you, there's nothing in it for them. I'll stretch out the legal process until they give up or come to an agreement that is favorable for us both (or until I become president).

If you're managing several 100k dollars, that is only a couple of %, and I would even consider that low in the contemporal global financial economical climate. People buy 10k of stock without batting an eye as a part of a solid investment strategy. Most people on this forum do not have an investment strategy and pump a small amount of money into bitcoin, hoping it will spit out a lambo, this is not investing, this is gambling.
Arguably, putting money in an asset that is not income-producing is probably gambling in general.

What would you do with the money after you've sold? 
Either you invested what you could afford, and you don't need the money you have tied up in bitcoin, or you've invested more than you should have, and got lucky. 
If I take out money, it would only be to put it in a better investment. This better investment would have to have a better long term outlook. At the moment, the only reason I would sell, would be to pay for a better house for me and my family. All other reasons are irrelevant. If bitcoin proves to be a good investment, that is another reason not to sell (yet) and let it keep appreciating. 
I am working on a workable exit strategy and diversification of my assets once my investment portfolio reaches 3-4 million USD in value. At this point, I will cut back on the hours at work, I will take more holidays, at good resorts, I will do whatever I want and live comfortably. If at that point over 70% of my assets are in bitcoin, I will need to diversify before retiring. Betting everything on one asset is not smart. Ideally I would get 50% in some kind of limited-loss financial instrument, and get payouts for spending money from that. I've not completely formed my strategy yet, but I will probably need a couple of bull runs, and hope I don't lose my keys in a boating accident in between.

To be fair, Bcash and BSV are still in the top 10 cryptocurrencies. Whatever you call a scam (and I agree) other people might want to use. As a business, it would not be a great model to be too picky on how customers choose to pay you. If you don't like to hold on to anything that is not bitcoin, you can exchange it at your end. But please, don't shit on a business choosing to accept cryptocurrency. They do not have a flag up "bcash only", they give you options, bitcoin is one of them, be happy.

(don't tell anything on the internet about how much you have and how you secure it)
@_date: 2018-10-17 17:33:29
That is inherently true, nothing has absolute security. But BTC is orders of magnitude more secure compared to almost any other monetary instrument you'll ever use.
A quick calculation shows that even a 100 years of computing with computers that are 1000 times faster then what we have now would not even come anywhere close to hacking bitcoin. 
Let's assume 50 million keys calculated per second on a GPU. Lets further assume everyone on earth has such an GPU running and that checking the addresses for a balance takes no time.
So 10 billion (rounded up) people generate and check 50 billion keys per second (remember 1000 times faster) for 100 years.
A: 10*1000^3 50 * 1000^3 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 365 * 100 = 1.5768*10^30
B: At the same time we have 2^160 or ~1.4615*10^48 possible addresses with 2^96 private keys each.
A/B = 1.0788 * 10^-18. So I'll take my chances...

70-90% of 20 000 is 14 000-18 000. So a 70% drop of 20k would be 6k, which is the approximate level where BTC has been going sideways for months, a 90% drop would be a drop to 2k, pretty scary.

@_date: 2019-03-14 00:15:04
This is really not double spending. This is broadcasting two transactions, and the one with the largest fee gets processed first, hence this is the only spending that occurs.
The problem is that the atm does not wait for the transaction to confirm. It still is stealing. By using the ATM, you are engaging in a contract where you exchange your bitcoin for cash. If you fail to stick to your end of the deal, you commit fraud.

Bitcoin is as much about money laundering as cash is. It's easy to hide, hard to confiscate and permissionless to use. That's why cash is no longer liked by government, that's why bitcoin is not liked. 
The difference is, they control cash, they don't control bitcoin. 
Being against or in favor of certain taxes is not even the point. I am in favor of freedom, which is what bitcoin gives. Obviously, if I choose to stay on the legal side of the law, I'll be on the hook for capital gains taxes and income taxes and sales taxes etc... it does not matter if my transaction runs through VISA or bitcoin, the same taxation applies as far as the government is concerned. The only thing that is different is that VISA does no longer get their cut of every single transaction I make.

The longest chain UNDER THE CONSENSUS RULES wins, indeed. This makes you the largest miner. This does not mean you can mine whatever you want, because if you don't the NODES you don't control will reject your blocks, and they will accept the blocks of the minority miners, and these will build the longest chain UNDER THE BITCOIN CONSENSUS RULES. 
Having the largest amount of mining power does not give you the default permission to change the current consensus rules.

At some point, you can even give out more IOU's than you have money in the vault, because nobody exchanges them for money anyway. Then you do some credit default swaps on collateralized mortgaged backed securities on a leveraged future option and bam, all your homies are angry at you.

There is a difference between privacy and secrecy. It is true that all transactions of BTC are public, this does not mean that the identity of the actors from each transaction is public.
The bitcoin blockchain has never been successfully hacked. Your information is wrong. What has been hacked is exchanges and other services. Leaving your funds in a wallet of which you do not control the private key is the same as leaving you cash money on a table in a nightclub. There is some acces control by the bouncer, but it does not make it a secure environment. BTC transactions are final and irreversible, this is a feature, not a flaw.
Government regulation can do all they want, there is no way to kill bitcoin. Bitcoin transformed money into a content type, you can send bitcoin transactions in any form possible, even if the government would ban the internet, this does not mean bitcoin will die. Making bitcoin transactions illegal is impossible, because anything can be a bitcoin transaction. Regulation can tax bitcoin, regulation can make it harder to get your fiat currency converted into bitcoin but regulation can not kill bitcoin. It is a borderless, decentralized currency. 
Nobody controls BTC, it is true that a couple of big players can influence the price of BTC in USD, but they can not control the existence or any transaction on the BTC blockchain. Larger adoption of BTC will only make it more accessible. 
The price can go up and down, that is true, if the big so-called 'whales' sell off, we would probably see a dip in the price. But for them to start selling something fundamental would have to change. Why would they sell this great asset? Keep in mind, this is also wealth that is outside of government control. It is possible, bitcoin can go to 0. Just ask the people in Venezuela or Zimbabwe if this is a negative for bitcoin, or for any form of money. 
@_date: 2018-10-31 17:01:24
No, you're not. Neither are you when you are using bitcoin. The same reasoning is that I am a murderer because I have a gun. If I do not use my gun to murder, I am not a murderer. If I do not use my earned money to buy evil, I am not evil. Illicit organisations inherently use some monetary system, this does not make the system they use a system that is exclusively used for illicit purposes. Bitcoin has both advantages and disadvantages to use for illegal activities. So has USD, so have commodities like gold. If you use the monetary system implied by the country you live in, and that same country supports terrorism, and you do not agree with that, you can use your democratic vote to try and change that. You can renounce your citizenship, or you can ignore it, because you feel you are not capable of changing it anyway. You should never be guilty by using the same monetary instruments.

Again, this depends on how much trouble a potential scammer wants to do... 
There is nothing inherently wrong with a third-party block explorer, but bitcoin exactly solves the issue for needing a trusted third party. You don't need a third party in bitcoin, you can do it yourself. How about you verify through a friend/partner at home with the Trezor? They transact, you check the block explorer, and you make a phonecall to your friend to confirm again. It might seem overkill, but you want to be cautious. 
Generally, because bitcoin is currently not widely adopted, it is inherently a little bit suspicious when someone asks to pay through magic internet money without you offering it. You can give them the benefit of the doubt. Trust, but verify!

Bitcoin is definitely the smoother way to go, if you feel confident and know what you are doing, there is no issue. 
Go for it, this is good for you, and for the adoption of bitcoin. If you feel like it, please post an update after the transaction here.

Be very careful! If this would be your first bitcoin transaction, for such a large amount, you need to know what you are doing. There is no reason this can not go safe, but as with all the new technologies, user interface and straightforward information is hard. 
1) Never accept any other proof of transfer than the value showing up in your own wallet. 
2) If it shows up in your wallet, you're relatively sure it will be there 'for real'. I would suggest you buy the new owner a coffee or a beer, and you wait 30 min before handing over the keys. 
3) Don't trust anything you see on any of his devices or third parties you do not control. This can be photoshopped, manipulated,... Confirmation of a transaction send, does NOT mean the transaction is confirmed on the blockchain. 
4) If you feel uneasy, don't continue. If he is honestly trying to buy your car for bitcoin, there is nothing wrong with that, and he will understand the 30 min wait time. If he does not, sell your car to someone else. 
5) Welcome to bitcoin.

No, you can still exchange the franc or other former national currencies of EMU member states for euro's at the national bank of the country that previously had the franc, or gulden, or shilling, or peso, or lira, or mark, or... These currencies have not failed, their value has been tied to the euro, and the printing and practical use has been discontinued. 
This exchange might not be economically worth it when you have to go to the national bank, pay a fee etc... for some pocket change you found in an old pair of pants. But it will be worth it for the stack of money you find under late grandma's mattress when cleaning up her house. 
This is something you can not do with the discontinued reichsmark or zimbabwean dollar which are examples of failed fiat currencies. All the value in these notes and coins lies in its historical collector's value. You can only sell it as a memorability, not exchange it for money at the issuing institution (or its successor). This means that this currency has failed.

Euh... They will break bitcoin by putting money into it? Price is not the only metric for Bitcoins success. Such an 'attack' would require all banks globally to join forces together to be successful, otherwise the one bank that bought but did not sell would become powerful.

If you show me a treasury bill that completely beats inflation, I'll take it right away, my friend. Of course investing makes your money work for you, depending on the investment vehicle this can be profitable or not. Investing in crypto is one form of investing, and can be a part of a well diversified portfolio. Keeping large amounts of cash in dollar bills under your matress is a bad idea, because it loses purchasing power due to inflation. Any money you don't need to spend on the short term, you should invest. 
@_date: 2019-08-24 08:28:28

You have paid for bank accounts in 18 years. Just check the total amount you've paid your bank for all kind of fees, and reduced interest payments. 
The bank will get its money, and if they can convince you they are better because they are not upfront with their cost model ('no monthly fee') then they will use that model, and bleed you dry like a tick sucking on a moose.

You don't need identity verification to use the bitcoin network. Nobody cares if you're under 18 or an attack helicopter. The main problem lies with your bank that does not allow you to do whatever you want with your own money. Local ATM's or peer-to-peer might be your best options.

I would not even carry a hardware wallet with more than 5 BTC on it. Anything storing more than that requires physical access to a secure location and possibly a third party approval (spouse, timelock,..). 
If I am that rich, that kidnapping becomes a valid problem, I'm rich enough to hire two navy seals to shadow me and pop a bullet in the back of your head before you kidnap me. 
People always seem to assume that I am capable to transfer bitcoin in huge quantities if I have any. This is fundamentally false.

If I look at that graph, the (3 month) treasury bills have been under performing inflation ever since somewhere in 2010. 
And yes, currently, crypto is not a currency. I would like it to be, but there still needs to be quite a bit more adaptation before it becomes a currency. 
'Part of a well diversified portfolio' means "part" By all means, don't put all your money in there! But anyone who has been keeping part of his money in bitcoin for more than a year will happily say that it has been a volatile but well performing part of the portfolio, even in first world countries. Just because it is currently 66% down from its ATH does not mean everyone lost in it. The volatility and risk is an inherent part of the potential upward movement of the asset.

If they send the money to a wallet address you did not approve for that transaction, then it is their problem, and this has nothing to do with coinbase.

Indeed. Many people do not realize this. It makes a honeypot, certainly if you combine it with centralized wallets on exchanges. KYC is not a requirement for crypto, it is a requirement for banks. I am using a big exchange, but they don't know my KYC. I was lucky to be in a situation that I could use either one of two nationalities/identities. The one used for the KYC is in the meantime expired and does not exist any longer. I transfer money to the exchange from a dedicated bank account.

To ban something means to make it illegal. Illegality stems out of something written in a law, laws are bound to jurisdiction. Is bitcoin bound to a geographical location? If smoking weed is illegal in your country, is it illegal for you to smoke weed in canada? How will your country ever find out, and what are they going to do about it?
Now, imagine the country where you can use bitcoin is the internet, and the country where it is illegal is the united states. The inly option to bban bitcoin effectively would be to ban the internet. ANY kind of network trafgic could potentially contain a bitcoin transaction, it is impossible to police. Sure, banning exchanges and use of bitcoin for official payments is possible. This will make it harder for bitcoin to gain traction. But they can not effectively enforce any kind of ban against the bitcoin network itself. It happend. This technology is out there.

To time the market, you need to be right twice, sell at the top, buy at the bottom. Missing the previous ATH with one week would drastically have changed your outcome. Buying back at 8k, is totally missing the bottom,... it is unpredictable, so don't try to predict it, and you'll be fine.

I agree completely. I did not try to say that crypto is good for generating cash flow. It is however one way of diversifying your holdings, so you're not 100&amp; invested in USD. (to be fair, if USD becomes worthless, you'll have bigger problems than money)
I would only advise to take a minor share of your total portfolio in crypto, but yes, I am a believer that crypto has a high upwards potential. Much in the same way as you only buy stock in companies that you believe have upwards potential. Crypto does not give cashflow, in this way it would be similar to keeping part of your holdings in norwegian kroner or swiss francs. It is a speculation that the exchange rate of BTC vs the USD will go up. By all means, it is a personal choice how you invest your money, and crypto does not have a long history, it has a huge upwards potential, it can also drop to 0. Inform yourself, and invest based on your risk tolerance. 
I do appreciate your critical voice on this forum, that BTC is not almighty and the only and best investment you can find, a voice of reason that is to often absent.

It is more affiliated, the gas station has less access. You can not check your balance in the gas station, all the bank gives is an 'approved' or 'denied'. In the case of an ATM connection, there is more information transferred between the bank and the ATM. The companies might not be directly affiliated, there might not be a charge for every information request from the ATM. Another likely revenue stream is that the owner of the ATM pays a yearly subscription to the banks to be able to access their information and log into their network.
It is naive to assume banks would do this for free.

You are technically correct, BUT... usually as a end user you are not given the option to use either authenticator or SMS. This together with the fact that the use of SMS as 2FA is already thousands times more secure compared to the average hunter2-user, you will be fine. Most criminals are opportunistic. All you have to do is make it harder for them, not impossible. They will not steal if it is hard to steal when others secure their assets less.
As far is security goes, use 2FA; any 2FA. If you are given the option, use google authenticator, if not use SMS. Don't refrain from using 2FA because the method is not absolutely secure.

Bitcoin is a monetary instrument with a fixed supply. This means that for each and every bitcoin, there always is an owner (or at least an address) that has control over the bitcoin. 
Credit is imaginary future money that somebody allows you to spend at this time. It is impossible to write in the ledger that you will pay back your credit in the future if you don't have the funds available now. 
So credit in the bitcoin world needs to be fully backed by someone who wants to lend you the money. 
In the fiat system, each time a loan is started, money is actually created.

You need to layer your security on many levels. First of all, physical security, if nobody can access your offline wallet, nobody can steal your coins. This is the first mistake, getting (multiple) custodial service(s). He used the offered 2FA, which is not the most secure, admittedly, but this was a good step towards security. 2FA (whichever kind of 2FA) is way, way, way more secure than not using 2FA. Keep in mind that in this case, he was actively targeted by AT&amp;T employees. One other thing he might have done wrong is using the same emailaddress, without 2FA to use as recovery for several of these accounts. You need to have operating procedures in place for security. Trading 2 MM USD is not the same as reaching a new high score in candy crush. At some point, using dedicated hardware for storage (separate ledger, laptop and smartphone, in an airgapped safe) and VPN for transactions and multisig, would make part of a security model you can operate. 
A textfile with your passwords and wallet seeds on your 2FA protected dropbox is NOT a good security model. 15 different exchanges linked to the same email/cellphone is NOT a good security model. Heck, I can't even trust my bank with login credentials, so how would I trust a 5 year old internet startup exchange...

I guess you're both a bit right. SMS 2FA is safe, a whole lot safer compared to no SMS 2FA. Furthermore, a dedicated prepaid number is even safer compared to your regular cell number. 
However, it is not absolutely safe, and theoretical, it can be hacked. The same goes for authenticator app. 
Just be safe, and know what you are doing. A password and an sms is safe for 90% of the people, if you're not in the US, it is even safer (social engineering attacks on SIM cards are harder abroad).

2FA via sms is implemented because it can be used by a lot of people, not because security experts claim that it is the best. It is an improvement over a password, that is all. 
Authenticator apps require a smartphone or a dedicated hardware device, and the knowhow to operate it. There are a lot of people that have difficulties with technology, and only just started with cellphones and sms. They can use SMS 2FA, but have no clue how to use the other. Large services need to take into account the variety of users they want to serve, hence the SMS. People above 60-65 years of age are generally (there are exceptions) a bit slower to adapt to new technology.

I've been looking into the same problem (from Belgium to Canada). I agree, the banks fuck you out of +/-$50 per transaction for taking your money and letting it disappear for a week before appearing in the account in the other country.
The problem with trying to do this via crypto is that you pay fees when buying crypto, and you pay fees when selling it again, and the buy price is always higher than the sell price too. I've not found a method (that seemed reliable) to transfer money transatlantic that turns out to be cheaper than the legacy banking system. 
The whole equilibrium changes when you get paid in crypto or can pay stuff in crypto. But as long as you have to go Fiat--&gt;crypto--&gt;fiat, you're better off doing fiat---&gt;fiat. 
Unless you hate banks that much that paying more to support crypto is worth it for you.

The inherent ability to trace every single satochi on the blockchain might become an issue. Just think about it, how much money did you handle (fiat money) that was ever used in an illegal transaction? Probably a lot, even if you do not do anything illegal. Fiat is excellently fungible, there is no way to keep track of serial numbers. So as soon as the fiat can not be directly linked to the criminal use, there is no further issue for the person possessing it. 
Now crypto (or more specifically bitcoin) allows to track the transaction of every little transaction on its blockchain. If they find a 'criminal' and declare his wallet 'dirty money' they can equally declare all the money that ever left his wallet as dirty. This becomes an issue if somebody 10 steps away from the criminal, suddenly has bitcoin, legitimately obtained, that he can not use any longer, because it is on a blacklist. Therefore it is possible that bitcoin is not completely fungible.

This is cherry picking. Obviously if you have full access to the legacy banking system and a credit card and a good credit score, the banking system will (currently) serve you better then bitcoin. However, if you're one of the other 7 billion people in the world, you will be better of with bitcoin, even now. It is accessible, for everyone, from everywhere for anything. If you do not consider this an advantage, you have a skewed view on global economics. 
@_date: 2019-02-20 22:37:33
Obviously it can not. The global financial system now consist of so much money that does not even exist, in any way or form. It is fundamentally impossible in the current system to settle all debt. Bitcoin is not dependent on debt, but bitcoin can be exchanged for (non-financial) goods and services. Bitcoin can be used for purchasing commodities. 
Obviously there will become a time that there will be wide spread bitcoin derivatives (altcoins?) and bitcoin-based debt, which will bring us to a partial centralization of these things again. There will always be such a thing, because there is a market for it. It does not mean it is a good idea, but many people spend lots of money on bad ideas.
The whole stock exchange market is currently also valued in USD (or other local fiat). This makes some sense to value the 'price' of the company, but there are no 'real' dollars behind this. This is just a part of the future revenue that is expressed in a price. These things can be expressed in any currency. If you take a big international company (like coca cola), and imagine the USD drops 90% overnight. Does this mean the future revenue of coca cola drops 90%? They will feel US inflation, but a large part of their sales is international, so their future revenue will probably only drop 20% or 30%. This means that their share price, denominated in USD will go up, because USD goes down. USD is just used as a way to account for future value, but it is not 'real' money.
Is bitcoin 'real' money. What is 'real' money. It can be a very semantic discussion, but the global financial system will never be replaced by a single "unit of account". It is not USD now, and it will not be BTC in the future. International trade is often denominated in USD, but this is not a requirement, all that is needed is both trading partners to agree on what unit of account to use and how much of this unit they will transfer for certain goods or services. The advantage of BTC is, that it is not bound to any state and by definition neutral. We will see an increased use of BTC in international trade, but this will be a transitional currency, and the trading partners will transfer this into their own fiat fairly fast. A bit further in the future, they will hold on to bitcoin, and at some point, a significant part of international trade will be denominated in bitcoin (or at least not in some kind of fiat).

The price increases because the supply and demand equilibrium changed. As bitcoin has a stable supply the demand increased.

It is a way to try and stimulate the economy by desincentivizing storing large amounts of money and keeping it on the sidelines. As soon as the interest rate is lower then the inflation rate, the purchasing power of your money erodes. This means "0" is not that relevant if inflation is already at 2-3%. It is more a psychological barrier. Sometimes for the banks it is worth it to put large amounts of cash there with a guaranteed low negative return compared to put it in more risky investments that can go much lower (or much higher).

Just like Dvorak, electric cars and bitcoin, the main issue is the entry effort. 
-I can type just fine on QWERTY, why would I need Dvorak, how would it help me?
-I can pay anything I want with VISA, why would I need Bitcoin?
-My car drives fine on fossilized dinosaurs, why would I need a new one?
We're starting to see a copernical shift concerning the electrical car. There is the issue of (anthropogenic) climate change and increasing fuel costs. This together with increasing availability of public charging infrastructure, really lowers the step for entry into the e-vehicle market. 
With the keyboard, the marginal advantage of Dvorak is simply not there. You have the issue not to be able to type on other machine's (I know... not completely true). You have only a limited benefit of typing on Dvorak, you need to install special software in certain operating systems. It is (at the moment) more inconvenient to shift to Dvorak then it is to stick with QWERTY. The market share of QWERTY is just to high. 
-With bitcoin it still is the same, why change? What is the advantage of bitcoin? The traditional banking system is so ingrained in the day-to-day spending of the general public. The inflationary/deflationary argument is largely irrelevant to the large public, they are mostly in debt anyway. The change will come when there is enough regulation in place that companies can start accepting bitcoin with fiscal ans legal certainty. Once they realize that they can split the 3% VISA fee between them and the customer if they use crypto, and there is a user interface to make crypto spending as convenient as using your credit card, there will be a shift. We are not there yet. Maybe we never will. There is currently a huge margin of money being made by payment processors. Complete decentralization and digitization will make this cheaper, and there will be an economical incentive to move away from the traditional payment processing system.

Well, we've been at 20k two years ago. I honestly believe, we will go to 250k before dropping back to 100k. 
That is what separate's the real holders. If you are sitting on one bitcoin, you're sitting at a couple of months wage. If you're sitting on one bitcoin at 250k, for a lot of us, you're looking at the wage for the better part of a decade. Depending on your financial situation, it would be stupid not to liquidate. Risking losing 250k is a lot bigger a risk when this is 80% of your investments vs when it is 2%. If bitcoin keeps growing, we will start to see liquidation, and at the same time consolidation by bigger players. 
Before you know it, wealth inequality will keep its current status quo, except for a couple of lucky early adopters that became wealthy by selling at the right time. 
Bitcoin gives access to the other 6 billion, it gives them access to a financial market, it does not give them means. Bitcoin makes sure every transaction is treated equally, but to start, you need to make a transaction. The moment on-chain transactions will cost the same as a mid-level sedan, we can barely speak about being inclusive. People with 1 bitcoin will be lucky.

Better than Western Union, YES.
It all depends on certain factors. Can the recipients use the BTC or convert it to their respective currency to use? What fees are associated with that? What is the spread on the exchange? What is the % WU charges? In almost all occasions, BTC will be the preferred way compared to WU. 
At the moment, BTC is not cheaper compared to traditional bank transfers. It is way faster, and way less paperwork compared to an international bank transfer. But if you have/need fiat on both sides, BTC will be more expensive because of the spread and exchange rate to which you are exposed twice. If you have the BTC, or can use BTC on the receiving side, don't think about it twice, BTC is the way to go, and goes faster than 5-12 business days.

And the point is that the price of bitcoin in USD is something we have not enough data for to identify a reliable pattern. We have a lot of data on the USD compared to BTC, and we know the USD is going down (in purchasing power), even by design. But we know nothing about bitcoin, its possible utility is great, adoption is low, and for now, it is remaining mostly a speculative asset. So its value is whatever some person thinks the next person is willing to pay for it. There are more and more people aware of bitcoin, so we might see more and more people adopting it and choosing to 'buy' some. But there are, for the moment, no guarantees, and it is very hard to predict a niche market. There is a reason penny stocks are so volatile and Apple is not, the company is bigger. The relative market value of bitcoin is tiny compared to some other valuta.

The systems of bitcoin can not go down. Due to the decentralized nature of the network, even if the biggest miners get shut down for some reason, the network does not collapse.

I think you don't really understand Bitcoin or credit cards. 
The official (Canadian) statement reads 


So a lot depends what a monetary instrument is. 
Depending on where you source your definitions (there does not appear to be a set legal definition, and that is on purpose. 


So that includes credit cards and cryptocurrency... so any time you do not declare that, you're subjecting yourself to possible prosecution. I know, many people do this, and allegedly I've done this myself too. 
Credit cards are basically little slips of plastic the bank gives you to prove to a vendor that you are most likely going to pay for what you intend to buy, and in the event you're not, that the bank will make the vendor whole and deal with you. If you have 10k on your credit card, you have access to 10k of financial instruments. It is not 10k in your pocket, obviously. Credit card transactions are centralized and tracked.
This brings us back to cryptocurrency, probably the most traceable asset of all with its public open blockchain. To take value out of the country, it needs to be in the country first. So, which country is your bitcoin in? What is bitcoin? Basically, all you have is an access code to move bits in a public ledger. Is this a monetary instrument? Is the ledger the instrument? You're not moving the ledger, you're only moving your private key. It is not even a physical object,... it gets very fuzzy what it is exactly, but I a quite sure that law enforcement can make your life really difficult if they suspect something is fishy about the way you approach that question.

We're almost running into that issue with the big miningpools. There are many different people mining, but only a few big pools. Luckily, so far it is still a plurality of minorities.

There are also many thousands of bitcoin lost on old discarded computer systems/hard drives with no longer any access to the private keys. Mostly in the early days, where some people were mining 'for fun' and bitcoin was not really worth something. So at that time, it was not worth the trouble to migrate your wallet to your new computer. This could be a very sizable amount of money today, but was simply 'forgotten'. 
It would be amazing if Satoshi decides to move some of his/her/its coins. Meaning she/them/it/he is still alive and kicking. But I do not think we'll see that happening, and the coins will be kept in a locked wallet and keep liquidity down.
That being said, the 21 million club is theoretical, and I think you should stick to the name of 21 million club. It is a theoretical maximum of the amount of people that can possess 1 bitcoin, and it is theoretical correct. Practically, we know we will never come close to 21 million members.

There is a risk and reward relationship. If I have all the money I need to live comfortable for the rest of my life, I prefer not to take risks with that. So yes, I'll evaluate whatever is on the market when I have several millions. I obviously not keep it in fiat under my mattress, but would preferably go towards something like high-yield bonds. This should maintain my capital agains inflation. At that moment, I am fine with losing out on potential gains in the risky cryptomarket. I have all the money I need, I will take the stress of a volatile investment out of my life.

The main problem is disinformation. If you're already reading this, here, then you are looking up channels to inform yourself. Just ask 10 random people (your mom, your aunt, your brother, your car mechanic, your supermarket checkout person, your boss, the person on the machine next to you at the gym, the person next to you at the busstop, the next person emailing you and the next uber driver you have) what bitcoin cash is, and if it is different from bitcoin, and how it is different. Most people have no clue, just like most people have no clue about the different types of motor oil. So if you need your oil changed, you go to google, check for motoroil and your car type, and buy the right stuff. If you go to twitter and look for bitcoin, you find the wrong stuff. If you go to bitcoin.com..... So you see, the problem is misinformation to people that are not informed. If this is their fist encounter with bitcoin, they will be reluctant to try again at a later point.

Depending on your other investments, and your net worth, and your debts and the size of your discretionary income, this could be fine. But I think it is on the high side for a volatile investment like bitcoin. You could get lucky, you probably will, I like to believe in that too, but there simply is too much uncertainty to me to invest 20%+ of my income. I do invest 20%+ of my paycheck, just not all into bitcoin. If it 'moons' I'll get a bit less of a return, if it crashes even further, I'll still have my returns from the stock market. Diversification...

Don't put money into bitcoin (or any investment) you can not afford to lose. 
If the dollar tanks this bad, do what you need to buy food and shelter for you and your loved ones. If this means exchanging bitcoin for goods and services (either through fiat or not) then do that. If you're not 'forced' to sell, don't. 
Start thinking about it different, take a third unit of account, that is neither dollar nor bitcoin. Let's say you have magic seashells that have some worth, and can be exchanged for either fiat or crypto. If you come into a situation and you have some extra magic seashells, would you use them to buy fiat or to buy crypto? Or a bit of both? At what rate? 
If you sell crypto for something else, that is not a good or service you immediately consume, would that be a better asset than crypto? 
Even if you think crypto might not rise as much as other people think, is the dollar really the better alternative? 
@_date: 2019-04-02 01:00:05
Lambo seems the solid investment here. 
But you're right. If you have a sensible 5% of your portfolio in crypto now, and the next bull run is another 500%, this will be +/- 25% of your portfolio. At that point, you might be relatively overexposed to bitcoin, and sell off half of it to buy more other assets or lambo's. Diversification is key. Don't sell your crypto however to just have your dollars lose purchasing power on a savings account.

If you really want to be sure, buy an empty hard drive and install that one. 
You can keep the laptop with the wallet completely offline, and broadcast your transactions through transferring to a USB stick. You don't need to do transactions often with this amount of money, the added hassle of making the transaction is not that much, and the added security is massive.
Best security is obviously to not let anybody know about what and how you secure your BTC. A simple paper wallet taped on your bathroom mirror is a million times safer compared to a software hot wallet. If you want to make it even more secure, tape it to the back of your mirror. Nobody knows it's there, people that just happen to see it don't know what it is. People looking for your private key will probably not have access to your bathroom. If they do, you have bigger worries. (obviously, a bank safe deposit box is safer than your bathroom mirror, but only marginally)

People don't talk about how much bitcoin they have when they have a decent amount. Certainly not to a bunch of internet strangers.

Or to provide food for your family, it really depends what else you have available. 
If I would be sitting on 250 bitcoin right now, I would sell 200, and diversify that money into the stock and bond market buying some ETF's of the SP500 and the Eurostoxx. Getting a good downpayment on my primary family residence,... and tell my boss to enjoy sucking on my juicy balls. I'm set for life, even in the current low market. I will diversify my risk, possibly risking on losing out on a lot of potential gains, but I have all the money that I could need in my life. I will not be driving a stupid lambo, but my 7 year old toyota is getting some premium oil. 
If I'm sitting on 1-10 bitcoin, I'll just keep them. Use the fiat I get from my job to pay for my expenses. We'll see,... if BTC price rises 25 to 250 times, I'll be in the scenario above and be a happy man. If it does not, I might have lost whatever I have in the market now. For anything in between, I'll probably enjoy a fancier evening out with my partner and splurge on that guacamole. 
It's not a black and white game. Bitcoin is not the only possible asset. Be smart, don't get fooled acting like a fanboy and dump all the money in btc before paying off your credit card debt. Don't be a fool to not buy any bitcoin either. Personally, I would advice to (after paying your debt) take 10-25% of your discretionary spending (Gross-tax-rent-utilities=discretionary) and drop that in bitcoin, on every paycheck. Dollar cost average investing. You should probably invest at least twice that amount in the stock/bond/realestate market. You'll be set.
But heck, this is I'm really not at the right place for sensible advice.

Exactly, only sell if with the funds you'll be buying something that has a better anticipated return. Better can be either less risky or more upwards potential.

True... Too many people see bitcoin only as an investment. 
While I think bitcoin can be an investment, I know it is a very volatile asset, and you should only invest a couple of % of your portfolio into bitcoin.
There are too many people here that have no investments other than bitcoin. Don't pick up any financial advice here. Don't even listen to me. 
Bitcoin can be a part of a well diversified investment portfolio. Bitcoin use cases will increase in the future, and this will probably go together with an increased dollar value per bitcoin. Bitcoin is inherently inflation protected, so it will preserve your purchasing power better compared to a stack of 50's under your pillow.
@_date: 2019-04-02 00:51:09
Nobody holds millions in cash in USD. All millionaires are holding income producing assets. Real estate and stock are inherently protected against inflation, because it is not USD. The USD is merely used as a unit for account. Yes, real estate value can drop, yes companies share price and dividends can plummet. These events are not directly linked with the USD. (there is a correlation between rental income, unemployment and financial crisis)

If you look at the distribution in different countries. It seems the american banking system is way more troublesome compared to the european banking system. People seem to be in less need for alternatives like bitcoin. There probably is a more general access to the basic banking system and financial services industry in european countries compared to the US, where there seems to be more demand for Bitcoin ATM's.

It is an indication, and an upper limit. Generally, if this number goes up, the amount of people that have more than 1000 USD in BTC also goes up. It is not a 1:1 relationship, but it is quite a decent indicator. A lot of money is kept custodial, which means many people own a bunch of USD in one (or a low number of) wallet. Some people have several wallets. The 1000 USD is a good cutoff, a good strategy is to keep your spending BTC "hot" and the rest "cold". For many, this would mean they have 1 or 2 1000USD+ wallets and then maybe a couple of small hot wallets. 
Overall, if, bear with me, from the 1.8 million addresses, there are 1.5 million users, then, when there are 2.4 million addresses, there will be approx 2 million users. The numbers scale, a similar % of people will behave in the same way. The law of large numbers state that there will be a deviation to the mean. Keeping keys of multiple wallets safe is 'harder' and more complicated. So for people having between 1k and 25k USD, most likely they own a simple hardware wallet. Anything more might get trickier to keep safe, not the wallet itself, but the backup or recovery seed needs to be very secure, but also very safe. Ironically, that is where bank vaults come in again.

Absolutely. I agree, the p2p networks are under central control. 
My point is that, for the average user, there is not a lot of benefit towards switching platforms from bank to bitcoin. This is because for the average user, the banks works well, and there is a limited driving force towards crypto. Most people acare very little about central banking, inflation and censorless transactions. This is because the can not change inflation and they are currently not censored.

Indeed. Bitcoin has very little advantages in use for people with full acces to legacy banking and credit cards etc... But it has the great advantage of control as a user. With cc you give up control to a (or more) central intermediary, which you pay 3-5% of every transaction (direct or indirect). This is al good and convenient until it stops working or they decide you are no longer welcome on the network.

Well, you are correct, and bitcoin is in every way more 'direct'. 
My point was that in most of the world, you don't have to rely on visa or mastercard or cheques, but you can push transactions from a bank account directly to another bank account without paying 5 euro to do so, and semi-instantaneous. Which is totally different from most US checking accounts that rely on pull transactions almost exclusively, and individuals usually do not have the possibility to do them. 
So, my point was more that the European banking system fits in between the US system and bitcoin. This also means bitcoin provides only a marginal improvement towards access to financial services for those with access to banking in the western world. For now. (The protection against inflation is another topic)

DO NOT KEEP YOUR FUNDS ON COINBASE. (sorry for shouting)
NOT YOUR KEYS, NOT YOUR COINS. (sorry for shouting again)
Coinbase is FIDC insured as a bank, because it is a bank. This is the case for all your funds kept in their USD accounts. If they fuck up on your crypto or stablecoin accounts, the FIDC will not give a fuck. They are NOT insured on crypto assets. 
COINBASE IS NOT FEDERALLY INSURED FOR THEIR CRYPTO ASSETS. 
Some things you can do that are vastly safer compared to a custodial account.
1) Get a wallet on your smartphone and transfer the funds in that (Eclair for instance, but search this subreddit for recommendations, don't trust me). You can have control over your own private keys within half an hour this way. 
2) Consider a hardware wallet; it's more safe. This is certainly advisable if you have a substantial amount of assets. You can combine this with a small amount of your bitcoin on your smartphone hot wallet for day-to-day use
3) Think about contingency and safety. Don't worry about the hardware wallet getting lost/destroyed. If the wallet is destroyed, this does not mean your bitcoin are destroyed. The real power lies in the 12/24 seed passphrase of your wallet (both smartphone or hardware). You would need to back up this passphrase. A good idea is to keep it in a safety deposit box. Or how about writing them on a piece of paper and sticking it behind the favorite picture of your kids in the picture frame. This will likely not get lost. Write instructions on how to recover the wallet for your spouse, and inform them about the location of the passphrase. 
4) DO NOT KEEP YOUR COINS ON AN EXCHANGE
5) GET CONTROL OVER YOUR OWN PRIVATE KEYS
This can not be shouted loud enough. You just told the whole world through reddit that you own (at least) 1 bitcoin. How long would it take someone through social engineering to find out who you are? You painted a target on your back. Now, protect yourself at the potential thread by getting control over your own private keys. It is all not a big problem when we're talking about 5-10k USD, nobody will kill you or kidnap your loved ones for this, or risk going to jail etc... but the moment we have another 1000%+ bullrun, people will do crazy things for these funds you now have. Don't be stupid. Get your coins off an exchange.
@_date: 2019-04-25 00:10:59
I hope so, I very much do. 
Just hypothetically; an average income in the US is +/- 60k USD. Considering a safe withdrawal rate of investments of 4% inflation adjusted, this would mean the 1 BTC at that moment would 1.5 million (I've seen crazier predictions, but let's run with this for a moment). So you have the equivalent of 1.5 million USD in bitcoin, which is a reasonable amount to retire on and draw from for the rest of your life. How would you proceed to do that?
1) Would you just go on and spend your bitcoin directly for your day-do-day needs at whatever the market price of BTC is at that moment?
2) Would you sell all your bitcoin, and dump it in widely diversified market following index funds and live of the proceeds of that?
3) A combination of the above?
My point is, from an investment standpoint, being exposed to bitcoin and only bitcoin is not healthy. It is inherently a volatile and thereby a risky asset. It is not a diversified investment portfolio. 
Logically and rationally diversification would be ideal. The moment you have enough to retire on, your investment focus should be on capital preservation and not on gains any longer. Does that make sense? I would love to hear your thoughts on this.

Stocks are different, in a way that stocks can only be traded on an exchange. Stocks are not meant to be spend for groceries/cocaine/... Bitcoin is a currency, a custodial account that does not give you access to the best usecase of a currency is, in my opinion, very, very, useless. I agree, some people should not be trusted with their own private keys, but the option should at least be there to spend the crypto. If not, you can only use bitcoin as a speculative asset, and you can only cash it out in fiat afterwards. 
In my opinion, a very bad system for the user, and good for the bank.

Holy fuck... This is part of the reason why it is so hard. They do a good job in obfuscating hidden messages in between correct facts. You need to read and spend a lot of time in the cryptocommunity to understand what is correct and what is not. For my uncle John, this would be a good explanation, with a lot of information simply explained, about bitcoin. But there are some fundamental wrong messages in there. 
I am not sure if this is good or bad for crypto. In the end, I think it is positive for the cryptocommunity as a whole. It could be a lot better, but we need adoption and understanding. Maybe we should not let 'good' be the enemy of 'perfect'. I could not make a better movie, but I sure could help and write a script about the facts itterated in it a bit better.

How many times does this needs to be repeated before people finally catch on. Being able to store your own funds is the big advantage of BTC. Not using this means essentially you're back to using a bank, who will take advantage of the leverage you give them over you, either now or in the future.

Problem is that many merchants that accept BTC are currently doing this through a (shitty) payment processor that pays them in fiat and you're stuck with a very bad exchange rate for your purchase. It is really not worth it if you use fiat to buy bitcoin, to pay a merchant's payment processor to pay the merchant back in fiat. All you do is paying even more intermediary than you would with the current legacy banking system. You need merchants that accept bitcoin directly, and will be inclined to actually use it as bitcoin as well. It saves them a lot on processing fees. But it is a large learning curve, and the adoption is generally low... Chicken and or egg problem. However, I want to use bitcoin, but I do not want to do it to solely subsidize bitpay.

There might be people that made a lot of money in crypto, and would like to use this as a way to be able to spend it without converting it to fiat, to avoid taxable events. But these people are stupid. 
1) they left way to much money on coinbase. 
2) They pay way to many fees to coinbase this way. 
3) They don't realize coinbase is selling crypto on their behalf anyway.

It holds true for company equity as well. If a company is 'worth' 100 million, meaning the sum of al its liquid and illiquid assets, it will be impossible in case the company wants to liquidate to extract the ful0 million out of the assets. Specialized equipment might be very valuable for the company, but worth shit on the second hand market.

What is a bubble...
At least, real estate is cash flow producing. Even if the book value drops, there is still a cash flow of rental income being produced.
Stocks are companies that produce value, some can crash, but as a whole, there will always be value in the production of goods and services. They also mostly regularly pay out dividends, which is cashflow. 
Commodities might be a good deal, depending on the commodity. Ultimately gold is some kind of commodity, but so is bitcoin...

Fractional lending will be impossible, fully backed lending will. You can exchange bitcoin for goods and services. If you lend someone bitcoin, they actually promise to render goods and services in the future.
On the other hand, I don't really see bitcoin taking over the whole financial market. But even if they (we?) get 1-5% of the market share, the central bank will be stressed. This shows the potential, and they will either adapt their policies to avoid people choosing BTC over USD, or they will die completely. The people in the central banks are not stupid. At the moment, adoption is way to low to worry about BTC.

Don't forget, being your own bank also gives you your own responsibility. There's nobody to go cry to when you fuck up, so don't fuck up. Think before you do. 
Keep your passphrase backed up on different physical location. DON'T put it in the cloud. Have a contingency plan if your physical device gets stolen, or, more likely, gets lost. 
Keep a hot wallet on your phone for day-to-day use, with only a couple of 100$ in MAX! Keep the rest in cold storage on your ledger or trezor. You don't need the device to put funds on it, but you should plug it in and run it every couple of months to install essential patches and security updates before the firmware you're running becomes compromised.

I looked quite deep into this ootion for euro to canadian dollar a couple of months ago. You're having commissions and twice the buy/sell spread. If you are having access to regular banking services, it will be costing a lot less to go through the bank.
The main problem is that you need to convert twice. If you earn bitcoin or can spend it directly, it might be worth it. But for now, stick with the banking cartel.

Your wallet holds your public keys to sign a transaction. You can take the keys from one wallet and put them in another, and you will be able to spend the bitcoins controlled with those keys. The 'standard' ledger wallet is (if I interpret correctly what you mean) just one random created wallet. You can either create new keys when you start with a wallet, or import keys you already own.

Both are true. Because it is hard to use bitcoin in a day-to-day transaction, it is currently more an invested asset. Over my whole investment portfolio I have a certain asset allocation that corresponds with my risk tolerance. Bitcoin is a risky asset, there is no denying that, it currently has a substantial volatility, certainly compared to bonds and blue chip stocks. The technology is vastly disruptive and controversial, nobody can tell you what is going to happen in 5 years, but it is either going to be all over or it is going to be a lot more valuable. I hope it will still be there, and I firmly believe it will make the world a better place, but I can not be sure about this. 
If bitcoin gets into the 6 digits, as OP suggests, then its relative proportion in my portfolio will soar from the intended 10% to approximately 70% of my portfolio. This would mean I am overexposed to a risky asset class within my portfolio, and I will sell of part of that to balance my portfolio again. This does not mean that I do not 'believe' in bitcoin, this means I make my investment decisions rationally and not based on dreams of racing lambo's on the moon. In al truth, this way, I might miss out on extraordinary gains, but I will also be protected against extraordinary losses.
The whole statement, don't invest more then what you are willing to lose stays true. If my current portfolio is 100 000 and I have 10% in Bitcoin, but Bitcoin goes from 5 000 to 100 000, if the rest stays constant I suddenly have a portfolio of 290 000 and 69% in Bitcoin. This seems overexposed to bitcoin, and I will sell off 170 000 of my bitcoin for more secure assets. Life is all about balance.

off-chain transactions do not increase the supply of bitcoin (they do increase the supply of transactions). Increased adoption and use cases for crypto will increase the usersbase, thereby increasing demand. Increased demand will lead to a higher price. How high? Nobody can fanthom or guess.

It seems like you live in ancient times. Things have value because they are useful, and barter is based on exchanging equally useful things. This is not a very efficient trade system. So as an in-between a highly divisible, fungible, uniform, portable limit-supply commodity as gold was used. When forged into coins, this made it easier to assess value, and easier than carrying around 20 cows to pay for your boat. Later on, we put the gold coins in a bank, and the bank gives you a note guaranteeing the deposit of your coin. Factually, you can exchange the note instead of the gold, increasing the portability and safety of larger transactions. This is reserve banking. Later on, the banks give out these notes for more than the gold they have, this is fractional reserve banking. Even later, the bank give out these notes without promising to exchange them for gold. But they do have a similar note from the government saying "trust me, I'm good for this" So factually, using USD is trusting the US government, not your trade partner. The sad thing is, they can not be trusted, because they can not redeem the promises they made, it really is physically impossible to get rid of all debt. (If that is required is another economical discussion point)

This must be one of the most unfounded reply's ever. Yes a 51% attack is a theoretical possibility, it has nothing to do with dropped hashrates.

Many people fail to understand that. Everybody who has more than approx 25k$ has it invested in the economy. This means it reflects the actual value of the goods and services produced by companies.

Nobody lost everything, there is still value in bitcoin. Buying at an all time high, of any asset, gives you historical the maximum of downward potential, by definition.

no, no they can not. Debt is essential for the system of fractional reserve banking to exist. The USD and most other monetary systems are debt-based money creation systems. So without debt, there would be no money. (You could argue that this would be better than debt based money.) The real problem is that the government controls the value of the money, and they inflate the currency supply to the extend that it benefits them to allow a further deficit spending. At the same time, the whole system erodes purchasing power from hard-working (mostly) honest people. This can not be done in the crypto-space. It is a global monetary instrument. It is the currency of the internet. It is fundamentally decentralized. No single (government) entity can control anything about bitcoin. If one country makes BTC illegal, you can route all your transactions through another country. Government can not confiscate bitcoin, they can not tax bitcoin transactions.

Exactly. A lot of people on the subreddit have sadly very little understanding of how investing goes. Moon, hodl, lambo, technology. How to relate the numbers of market cap to share price, how future cash flow is something that is not considered. How investing in companies and equities is NOT the same as holding onto fiat currency, fiat is only used as a unit of account for company productivity and future expected revenue. 
Going all in on crypto is a very, very bad idea from an investment point of view. Not owning any bitcoin is even a worse idea. Diversify, and do not invest more than what you can afford to lose. You lose out on an investment if you're forced to sell when it is down. This happens when you do not have the liquidity or cashflow required to overcome a downturn.
@_date: 2018-11-27 18:54:38

Hashrate corrects itself. Not every miner has the same overhead cost, not every miner mines for gain in USD.

For the sake of simplicity I'll be using USD and BTC, but most of my arguments go for any kind of fiat currency vs. any kind of crypto currency. 
You are missing a fundamental understanding of how the bank really functions and the interplay between the central bank and the private banks. Ever since we have a fiat currency system, and it not longer fully or partially backed with commodities like gold, money is debt-based. This means when the bank issues a loan, it basically creates money. You on the other hand promise to pay this money -and some extra- back to the bank. Making to much promises to the bank, and banks bundling these bad promises together is what lead to the banking crisis (which is what lead to bitcoin). 
If you deposit money in the bank, this money becomes part of the financial instruments the bank invests. 
You as a 'normal' person has basically 2 interactions; you receive money for providing a service to your employer and you spend money in exchange for goods and services you consume. Nowhere in this system is a bank required, it is however very convenient for you, your employer and your service and good providers. It is also beneficial for the bank, who always takes his share, and provides some convenience for you. You could however do this entirely cash based. 
Now, you want to buy a house and you do not have enough money you need a loan, which is a promise for future payment. Usually the seller can not float this, and will require full payment, so a third party is necessary. This third party gives you the money in exchange for your promise to pay it back, or it takes over your house. In this case it is irrelevant in what monetary system the money is expressed. This can be both BTC or USD (or whatever...). The fundamental difference between fiat currency and crypto in this case is that crypto can not be debt based, the entity loaning you the money needs to have 100% of the loaned crypto before they can give it out. This is fundamentally different from the fractional reserve banking system we have now. This also reduces a lot of risk on the derivative market, because the BTC is there, it 'exists'. The role of money loaner is a role that banks currently fill that will always be needed. In this way, banks will have to focus more on fully-backed loans compared to payment processing if everything goes crypto. 
A third role for the bank is 'saving' accounts, you have money you do not need to spend, you can save it and let it gather interest, for this, you trust the bank to give it back with a little bit of interest. This could indeed be the BTC that the bank lends out at a larger % to a home-buyer in the previous paragraph. This is different from how it currently works in the debt-based monetary system. 
If your savings account is full and you want to start investing. Let's look at the stock market, most other investment vehicles are very similar or derivative of the stock market. If you buy stock, you buy a part of that company. You get paid out a dividend and the value of your share increases if the value of the company increases. Currently we express value in USD, but if the economy is switching to BTC, you can express the companies value in BTC and you can buy a share of its stock in BTC, and be paid dividends in BTC. The company will do business in BTC and receive earnings in BTC. There is really no fundamental reason to use USD over BTC (there's probably a bunch of laws and whatever currently, but the underlying principle does not require USD). The stock market can function on BTC, just like it can function on USD, there is absolutely no reason it could not. There will still need to be a place for a bank/broker to route your stock purchases through. BTC might be peer-to-peer, shares of stock are by definition a centralized entity. We'll probably first see private stock in BTC, and slowly an increasing amount of publicly traded stocks in BTC. 
So, I guess I'll have to say both Yes and No to your statement. We will still need financial institutions if (a big if) society goes completely crypto. But we will not need them to be payment processors, we'll need them on the loan/investment side.

I know you're going to disagree on this. But this way of thinking is exactly wat holds a country back from developing further. I do not try to justify the morally and ethically wrong workings of the government. But by acting equally despicable and not contributing to the society with taxation on income of property, you(r landlord) are doing the same thing.
Politicians and government will always be an overhead cost. If they do skim some more money, that is double bad indeed. But look at it this way: if the (relatively wealthy) landlord is hiding money, and the government is going to 'extract' money from the society either way, the burden comes down to the poorer people. This is even less fair. Obviously the corruptness of government is the main driving factor, but by not paying taxes you facilitate further exploitation of the weakest members of society in your country.
I know I will not convince you, but I hope you'll think about this reasoning for more than 2 seconds.

Maybe this is the right place to put my question. I like the concept surrounding crypto and have been putting some money into it for quite some time now. I keep it in a hardware wallet, stored away safely. But I want to get a little bit more proactive in the bitcoin space. I would like to have the opportunity to use bitcoin to pay whenever I would happen to come across a merchant offering it. This would mean I need a wallet on my phone, right? Or at least this is the most practical way. Are there compatibility issues between wallets and point of sales? How would I be prepared best?
Basically, it would come down to taking 50-100 USD equivalent and have this in a wallet on my phone I can spend. *Which wallet would be best for this?* I would approach this in a way that user experience, usability is more important than security, in the same way that the cash in my physical wallet is also not secure if I lose my USD wallet.

The main problem I see immediately with bylls is the huge buy/sell spread. I need this to be lower then the EUR/CAD (+bank cost) to be of any use for me. I see this could be a good intermediary when you already get paid in BTC and need to pay someone in fiat, but I would need to exchange my funds twice, so it is not worth it from an economical point of view, at this time. 
@_date: 2018-11-28 01:40:09
Well, if starbucks does not have to pay the credit card fees, they save a couple of % on every purchase. If they transfer these savings onto Jessica, Katie and Sasha, they will sure pull up their crypto wallet on their iPhone. The incentive is completely an advantage of Starbucks. As an international company, it gives them another buffer to settle on international transaction costs. This will run up in their supply chain fast! It is much cheaper to settle in btc with the suppliers too. Poor visa, they will get poor. 
@_date: 2019-01-18 21:20:13
The theory is great, the implementation is still lacking. A bit more infrastructure and merchants will realize they do not have to pay the credit card fees, and don't have the credit card trouble for bitcoin transactions. That is when it gets real. It easily costs the merchant 2-5% less to accept your bitcoin compared to your cash or credit. At the moment, however, the merchant is not set up to pay his suppliers and/or staff with BTC, so he has to convert it back to fiat and lose that margin he had... It's a good time to be an exchange now :-)
Give it a couple of years.

Yes, absolutely! International bank transfers are a pain, with different time zones and opening hours and currencies and... You pay dozens of $ and your money is nowhere for sometimes 3 weeks. This is where banks fail to provide adequate service, and this is one of the first things that crypto will take over. At the moment there is still some complexity in transferring from crypto to fiat, and there are also fees on top of the crypto transaction fee, but depending on your $ amount, they can be vastly lower than the banks. And if time is of the essence, crypto transfers are vastly superior. If this system gets common place, we'll start seeing it for transfers within the country too, because the payment channel will be familiar. Before you know it, you will be paying your daily starbucks with crypto and there will be no 2% transaction fee, that is currently charged at the side of the merchant by the credit card transaction company. In the end, there will be a lower overhead with crypto in almost every aspect of financial transfers. I truly believe this is the future, and I am not alone!

What is the point of this? As long as you're not getting paid in BTC, there is absolutely no point paying very large fees to be able to use bitcoin in the traditional network. We don't need VISA, banks and payment processors to come to bitcoin transactions, so there is no need to introduce them. All this is, is a prepaid VISA card in CAD$, you send them your bitcoin, they exchange it for CAD$ and load it on the card you can use to pay in CAD$. 
What is the point in prepaid credit cards anyway. If it's prepaid, it's you giving the credit...

For most people that have easy acces to credit cards and do not travel often to countries with different currencies or do any transactions other than their day to day spending, bitcoin offers limited advantages today. It is complicated and unnecessary. This should be the basis understanding. 
How is bitcoin innovative? It is an open system. Governments can not control is. Why is government control bad? Look at the purchasing power of 1 USD over the last century, and the government debt we're having now, that will be covered by future inflation. (heck, it will never be covered)
Why bitcoin and not altcoins? This is the best question, they are convinces about crypto already! Why bitcoin, it has the longest chain, the most hash power, it is the most secure crypto out there, and it will, by defenition, alway be that way. Altcoins can serve niches, off-chain transactions can become mainstream, but bitcoin will be underlying. 
Price? Why would this be important? It is highly divisible and fungible (kind off) and the price reflects the global supply and demand. Global. 
The concept of the public ledger is a nice one. I like to refer to the [tally stick]( as such. In earlier time's... Imagine a bar and a customer wanting a beer. The customer had the gold, but it was locked up in the bank, and this way he could not pay immediately. But the bartender wants to sell beer, which is good for his business. They take a stick of natural wood, full of imperfections and split it lengthwise, creating two halves. It would be impossible to forge one of the halves because of the natural woodstructures. Now, every time the customer orders a beer, they line up the two halves and make a mark across the width of the stick, so every half carries the same number of marks. This way, they can keep track of the amount of beers served and not paid yet. The system can not be forged, the customer can not delete marks, because there is literally wood missing where the mark was made. The bartender can also not create extra marks on his stick, because they would be missing on the other half in possession of the customer. In this system the bartender and the customer do not have to trust each other, because the ledger is distributed, they each have a copy. This is the basis of bitcoin, one big tally stick that everybody has, that is cryptographically unforgeable and it keeps track of who has every piece of every bitcoin. 
It also makes sense to mention that nobody owns bitcoin, never. All the Bitcoin is technically on the blockchain. All you 'own' is the possibility to change the record on the ledger for the bitcoin associated with your name.  
@_date: 2018-11-03 15:14:41
I think we're more or less having the same point, but are talking next to each other. Whatever happens on an exchange does not change ownership of any coins, the exchange is a centralized ledger, and does not settle on the blockchain transferring funds between its virtual wallets. This means that inherently, you do not own the bitcoin until you hold the keys. The 'loan' or whatever happens on an exchange is a purely financial thing.
In a physical bank, you take a loan, you can get the physical cash and walk away with it (or buy goods and services). In an exchange, you can not withdraw your margin.

That is exactly my problem. On top of that, Bill and Jane are the same person in my problem. I am being paid in euro's but am working detached in Canada. Banks can help me, I was just wondering if there was not a better crypto solution. There does not appear to be one.
Even transferring euro to crypto and use that for a bill payment service costs me more then the occasional bank transfer, even if I make the calculations with 0 volatility of all (EUR/CAD, EUR/BTC and CAD/BTC) currency pairs. I've done the math. Many of these small crypto billpayment services are basically taking your crypto, convert it to fiat and pay your bill in fiat, and they charge you a hefty fee for that, mostly through bad exchange rates. I can do this myself and do not need to pay some middle-man startup for this.

Abra seems dodgy. They are investing my crypto in leveraged synthetic tokens... (from their blog) I really do not like the sound of that, sorry. I need to have CAD available, because supermarkets in canada (and anywhere else) do not accept bitcoin (yet). So I can not 'directly' send bitcoin. I was hoping for a way that was easier, but the north-american banking system seems to have missed the step into the 20th century and there is absolutely no way to fund your 'own' account digitally, and you need a credit card for everything. I know, there are bitcoin credit cards, but they again have the burden of huge fees. 
I see on coinmap there are indeed a couple of restaurants that accept Bitcoin, but as long as my landlord will not accept bitcoin, and my supermarket will not accept bitcoin, I need to have fiat. 
@_date: 2018-11-14 17:47:12
Jip, exactly my point! A lot of people do not care about debt, that is clear. These are also the people that will not advance in live and will be eternally complaining that they are broke and stuck in a dead-end job etc... All the while they make the same active choice not to care about the size of their car payments, the future payments on unnecessary credit card purchases. But they do think their neighbour will judge them for driving a 10 year old civic. They think the hot chick in the upstairs appartement will fuck them when they drive a brand new mustang. That people will like them better if they wear this expensive watch. That because they work, its okay to spend 10 dollars a day on your caffeine/sugar addiction. etc...
I personally invest some money as soon as every paycheck comes in. Some of it goes in to crypto, some of it goes into traditional market investment vehicles. I'm not going all in, I diversify. If bitcoin goes to "0" (unlikely), I am probably still better of than half of the society by having some stocks. If my stocks go to "0" (more likely) I'm still better off then most, because I have some crypto assets. If both go to "0" I am only just equal to the paycheck-to-paycheck person and still ahead of the credit card debt person. Plus, I've learned some valuable lessons. 
To make room for these investments, I live in a house that I can afford, and I drive a car that is paid off. I do go out to restaurants, I do buy sometimes coffee. I do check discounts at the supermarket, I do splurge on a nice bottle of scotch occasionally. It's all about a healthy balance within your means. I do realize that it helps that I am not working a minimum wage job, which is partially because I've invested a lot of time into my education.

That is indeed my plan. I want to be ready. Spending money in bitcoin makes it even more logic to keep buying till I find an employer that wants to pay me in bitcoin.

Interest is part of an inflationary monetary system. Bitcoin is by definition deflationary (non-inflationary).
You basically get interest to (partially) compensate for the loss in buying power of your USD due to inflation.
There is a fixed (future) supply of BTC, so there is no inflation of BTC, which inherently means that if the economy increases, the buying power of 1 BTC will increase.
No need to give your BTC to a central authority for interest, it is inherently incorporated in the bitcoin system.

I also believe that the market is a zero-sum game, and for you to win, someone has to lose. Stochastic your chances for continuing your winning streak decrease. Skills and knowledge might give you a bit of an advantage sometimes, but I am a firm believer in the efficient market theory in economics.

@_date: 2018-03-10 17:34:42
Imagine if there is a price difference between two exchanges, and you happen to have an account on both. You would buy some BTC on the cheaper exchange and immediately sell it on the more expensive exchange (you need to have a pool of funds and BTC on both exchanges for this to work). For you, instant money.  The cheaper exchange sees increase in demand, and puts its price a bit higher, the more expensive exchange sees an increase in supply, and drops it price a bit. Rinse and repeat till there is no more profit to be made.
Now imagine thousands of people trying to accomplish this, the price on all exchanges will be organically the same. Any change in prices will be exploited, either by the exchange owners or its members, so no change can exist in a dynamic equilibrium.
Note, this only works for open and free and honest exchanges, if an exchange has very strict limitations on who can join, and with which currency it can work, or what the maximal trade is... there are extra factors in play which will account for the difference.

That is exactly the problem I'm facing. It's not even about volatility, its the buy/sell spread. In your example that would be a $200 dollar bank fee to compete with (hell, if you transfer it back to fiat it would be +/- $400). As long as you need to buy and sell bitcoin, it is not a real alternative. And currently, sadly, it is not yet possible to use it for everything (without the same fees).

It is currently not possible to live without fiat in Canada. These partial solutions do not solve the core problem I am having of transferring fiat from europe to canada. Even if I implement every possible crypto bill payment service, I would still need CAD, just less of it. So the problem keeps persisting. As I do not earn money in crypto either, I am hit with exchange fees twice, and at this moment, the banks still offer the better solution for me (or so it seems).

Thanks for the suggestion. But again, as with most solutions, their proposed exchange rates are ridiculous. On top of that they even charge an extra .75% on every transaction. 


Currently, it seems that most crypto solutions are even bigger thieves then the banks. It's probably 'less' of an issue if you made good money with crypto, and do not mind paying an inflated rate. While it technically is possible, I am looking for the economical most viable solution for me, and it seems the banks are still winning at the moment.

I agree, not changing back to fiat is ideal. Sadly, we live not in an ideal world. Using crypto seems to be more expensive then using banks (if the end result is fiat on both sides). I can not send crypto, because it needs to be used for living expenses in canada. Tim Hortons does not accept crypto, Walmart does not accept crypto, and landlords do not accept crypto.

At least volatility goes in both directions, inflation only erodes the purchasing power of the currency. I agree, volatility is a bit too high currently, but there are many, many countries where volatility is almost equal to that of bitcoin.

That is true for the inflation % the government wants you to think is correct. The one reporting the inflation number is the one that has most to gain by underestimating that number. The government is the biggest debtor out there. "shrinkflation" is never included into inflation, rent is often not included in inflation,...

Be really careful to what is written in the lease. If electricity is included, then OP might have a problem. Is part of the rent considered a down payment on the electricity, then the final bill will be relevant. Is there a way to see what OP uses and what the renter uses? "Historical use" can be (weak) evidence here. Is there a statement in the lease that there can not be any commercial activities in the building? Would the judge see bitcoin mining as commercial?

Yeah, I have no problem to do this legally, and give my personal details to a trusted institution. This is against the decentralized philosophy, but not really a problem as banks have full scans of my ID etc. as well, and I am not doing anything illegal.
But indeed, my own research, and the lack of viable suggestions on here seem to suggest that his is a field that is not being served by crypto at the moment. The main problem being, it requires significant interaction with several, multinational banking institutions,... ironically this is also the core problem crypto is trying to solve. I hope in the near future bitcoin will be more and more accepted on the retail level. We need amazon, we need starbucks and we need walmart to get on board (in the US at least).

Good point. 
All the credit card companies want to do is get you to pay as much interest as possible, while keeping their own interest in the best regard. A decentralized blockchain-based payment system is direct competition for CC companies, if it reaches mainstream adoption. In this way, CC companies avoiding crypto-adoption by making it harder to purchase crypto, are protecting themselves. Reasonable bank-transfer networks, like SEPA, should become mainstream in the US too.

Isn't the general advice in the cryptosphere to not leave significant amounts of funds on exchanges? I am confused. Who actually has your funds if you do not have the keys or the cash? Yes, the exchange or the bank is in charge of your funds. They show you a number on a computer screen, and there is no transparency as to what is backing that number. Be aware. Don't leave your funds on the exchange. 
We do not need government control, we need smarter users. Government control is protecting stupid people against themselves and limits the actions of smart people.

The problem is, most people do not care about fractional reserve banking and the debt-based money creation system that is controlled by private banks. They want to know how it is going to make their life easier. The truth is, for most Americans, with acces to a bank account and a credit card, bitcoin will change their life insignificantly.

Statistically seen, outliers are a normal occurrence. 
There is a difference between the colloquial use of the word "normal" (like in, do not panic, nothing weird happened, nobody got hacked) and "according to a normal distribution".

The bet as the promise you make me that VTSAX will outperform BTC in 20 years, you know, the bet you came up with. 
You're accusing me of wanting fast money, while we are basically talking (joking) about a 20 year horizon, how is this fast? By all means VTSAX will be a great investment in that time horizon, but I am, at this moment, very risk tolerant. This means that I can invest in products with a higher beta-volatility, which, have a possibility of higher than average returns. With VTSAX, you bet on the average. I never said bitcoin is a better investment, I doubt it, but I would like to take the 20 year bet on its performance compared to VTSAX. The last 10 years, bitcoin clearly outperformed VTSAX as an investment vehicle, we're seeing more and more adoption which will only lead to more inherent value in BTC for other uses than investment, which will increase demand. Contrary to fiat, the supply of bitcoin is fixed, so an increase in demand will lead to a higher value. This is an oversimplification, but it will hold over 20 years, I believe. The chance that BTC will drop to 0 is almost the same as the chance that VTSAX will drop to 0.
Problem is, in 20 years, will you still pay me out in USD or will you pay me out in crypto?

Oh, how terrible, the credit card debt bubble will disappear. If you need credit, you still will need to go to a financial facility. This way you will be less likely to do impulse buys of stuff you don't need on credit. 
Who am I kidding, there will be other bitcoin-credit agencies or something, and people will make the same stupid mistakes over and over again. 
Credit card companies are the definition of third trusted party, the one that becomes obsolete with the blockchain technology. So yes, crypto is credit card competition in the way you see credit cards as a payment channel, not a personal loan channel. CC companies are both payment channels and credit agencies, they will probably focus more on the credit side of things. Nothing prevents Visa or Mastercard from issuing a credit card in bitcoin instead of dollar/euro.

Depending what your end goal is, you might have reached the level of wealth that would keep you living luxuriously  till you die if you bought a couple of grand worth of $2 bitcoin. It does not matter if you did not sell at the ATH, or even after it. If the money you get out fits with your investment purpose, does not matter where bitcoin is going after you buy out.
This being said,... Bitcoin is not a 'safe' investment. Do not buy bitcoin for investment purposes. Buy bitcoin to use bitcoin. Or don't buy bitcoin, ask to get paid in bitcoin. The value of the USD will become less and less relevant for you, you will consider purchasing power of a BTC, not of a USD. 
@_date: 2019-09-19 07:47:08
It is not, it depends a bit on the spread on the exchanges, but bitcoin carries approximately the same fee as a bank-to-bank international transfer if you transfer several 1000's of dollar. If you transfer less, bitcoin becomes the cheaper choice.
It is vastly cheaper compared to remittances. And it does not require a bank at both sides. It is also faster, it occurs independently of banking hours in different time zones.
It is nit because you have no use-case for this, that it does not have a use-case. You're in a privileged situation, be happy, but don't assume other people have the same needs. You're failing from a confirmation bias.

There is game theory at stake here. 
What a 51% attack can do, is mine their 'fork' faster compared to the 49% (on average), so their 'fork' becomes the longest chain. They can incorporate their transactions into their fork, they can also try and put the double spend-transactions in the 'honest' fork. Once one chain is the longest, all miners and nodes will continue on the longest fork, and abandon the other fork, therefore, nullifying the double spend attempt. 
To keep your 'fork' and your double spend, you need to alter the source code, and basically hard-fork bitcoin. Each node or miner can then decide which fork they follow. 
To change historical entries in the blockchain, you will need to rebuild the whole chain from the point at which you want to make the change. You will need to do the work for the POW and calculate every block again. This will be done while the 49% honest miners also continue building the longest chain and getting ahead of you. So with the smallest difference, you will come gradually closer and closer, while investing massive amounts of energy and money, without a guaranteed success. Miners will not join your chain, because they would lose all the rewards on the current chain, for a risky trick that does not have a greater reward. You would need mining equipment manufactured for yourself, but globally, all manufacturing plants for ASIC architecture (very specialized) are booked out years in advance. This is almost impossible, which is why the blockchain is called immutable. 
On the other hand, it would be much easier for the government to keep printing fiat money instead of attacking crypto.

The private key never leaves the Ledger NanoS. The app sends the transfer data to the nanoS, which applies the private key and sends the hashed key back to the app from where it gets uploaded and processed further. 
The main vulnerability in this system is that a 'hacker' manages to make the app send other data to the ledger to sign, without you knowing it. The app does display some information of the transaction, and so does the ledger where you can confirm amount and adres. So they can never steal your private key. 
Nothing is ultimately safe. One of the safest ways to own crypto, is that you are the only one that knows you own crypto. Keep it low profile. It requires a lot more effort from the criminal to try and steel crypto than to rob someone on the street. OTOH, it is the smart criminals you need to be most afraid of.

First of all, the existence of a transaction on the blockchain does not at al prove it was used to purchase anything illegal. If I do a 5$ bank account transfer to you, and write "for cocaine purchase" in the message field, this is not proof that you sold me cocaine, this only proves that I transferred 5$ to you. The burden of proof is still on the accuser.
"Government find key" would be the fiat equivalent of "government finds money on the street" If you leave your key out in public, then anybody will be able to steal your BTC, probably some other crook will be more efficient than the government. 
"Takes bitcoin" is exactly theft. Taking something without permission of the owner is theft. Civil forfeiture, is theft. It's not because law enforcement agencies are performing the theft that it is no longer theft. It might not carry any legal consequences for the thief, but it is still theft. The only way it would not be theft, is that I give it to them out of free will or in exchange for goods or services that were provided for me according to a predetermined contract detailing the goods/services and price.

I'm not talking about custodial services, they are an option, but best is to keep multiple secure locations, of which not all of them can be compromised.

Often on this sub, it is hard to find a solid argument and an underlying reasoning. Most of the posts are 'when moon?' 'Need Lambo.' 'two chicks at the same time, man!'
Currently bitcoin has beaten everybody's wildest dreams from 5 years ago. We're just starting to see the beginning of government and banks fighting back. Agreed, there is little they can do, but it will require some time and diligence to be able to reach current expectations. It is non-trivial to increase adoption. It will take a while before we will be able to buy our starbucks coffee with bitcoin. We will get there, but not tomorrow. If you see bitcoin as an investment, you should see it as a long term investment, otherwise, you could be in for a surprise.

The scalability of its use is huge. 'Minimal' investment for participation as a user in crypto is one thing. Complete decentralization is another thing. Slowly it is accepted in certain mainstream transactions, it will only be a matter of time that big companies will carry a BTC column on their balance sheet. Multinationals already have multiple currencies, so this will not matter much in accounting. Once the big companies accept BTC, smaller companies can pay them in BTC and they can pay employees in BTC if the local governments do not prohibit it. It will be snowballing, for sure. There is less chance of corruption, because of the transparency of the blockchain. There is Direct transaction, much faster then electronic payments now. Global transfers cost the same as any other transaction, no dependency on banks or some central system.
On the other hand,... most people are not capable of being trusted with keeping their own money secure. That is a huge negative. If someone makes a wrong transfer or loses his card or whatever, the bank can solve that problem. With bitcoin, there's nobody backing up your mistakes, nobody to go cry to, (nobody to charge you for that).

Hashrate has nothing to do with block speed. 
The amount of transactions has to do with either fees or delay time for a transaction to be included. This is only the case for on chain transactions. We will see more off-chain use, while this partially loses some of the features of bitcoin, it is cheaper, faster and better compared to legacy credit cards.

You're forgetting the change in purchasing power the house will have after 10 years. How many eggs can you buy with it. Inflation is about devaluing the unit of account from the top down. In bitcoin, there is no central devaluing. There is also no inherent deflation, it is anti-inflatiinary. It does no longer gives incentive to debt. In the current system, the largest debter is in control of your money supply. The less money is worth, the cheaper his loans get...

Indeed, and you will not see any government ban if there would not be mass adoption. The government could not care less about a couple of nerds that put some real dollars in crazy internet money. It's when everybody believes it is better to own crazy internet money then dollar; that is the moment the government gets scared.

You are privileged having acces to the banking system. Do not forget this is the exception globally. It is nit because you do not need anything else, that it is not needed anywhere. 


Agaun, anither company, that eats huge fees. Not an efficient value transfer system.


They are not allowed, because banks have the exclusive right on financial services and profit too much from the current system. There us ni uncentive for banks to increase their efficiency and cost model. 


Yes,... This again. It is not energy consumption that is polluting, it is energy production. The banking system runs in unicorn farts and is completely free of inefficiencies. If something is inefficient, how come we see a constant increase in mining power if there is noone forcing anybody to get in? The energy is used to secure the network.

This is assuming the bitcoin is all your money. If you have bought $1 in bitcoin @ 0.01 each, you would indeed have 2MM from selling them at ATH (a very unlikely event). However you also have all your other savings you could have done in this time, because the bitcoin is basically all gain. So your net worth would be significantly above the BTC sale alone. If you are bad with money/investments, I am quite sure you either would not have bought any BTC to begin with, or would have sold them way ahead of the ATH, rendering this discussion futile.
I do agree, 2 MM is nowhere near lambo money, but it is live comfortable ever after money. You invest 2 MM in a broad market index fund at 7-10% annual gains over the long term and withdraw around 4% (adjusted for bear market risk and inflation); this gives you $80k yearly income; not top high-roller, but comfortable. You can pay off your modest 3 BR house in a medium to high cost of living. You can drive a mid-range new car, or a top range 4 year old second hand sensible car. You can go out to eat, you don't have to worry about sudden expenses. You can afford the holiday in the Caribbean. You do not however have the money to fly your private jet to the caribean and get a helicopter to bring you from the airport to your private yacht. If you want to do that, you'll have to wait to sell your 100 BTC till McAfee does not eat his own dick.

You could just use $.

Context usually gives away what the exact meaning of the $ sign is. Reddit is extremely Americanized, but bitcoin is global. Or you use something based on the striped B of bitcoin, or the lower case b, to denot a smaller division, like  ᵬ or ҍ that are already unicode characters.

What's the use of a gun to beat cryptography?
Don't look for logic with criminals. Most criminals are opportunists, they act on impulses. 
Anyway, this is getting off track. The whole point is that it is a lot easier to steal fiat from someone compared to crypto. The whole 'gun' story to give up your private key assumes the robber knows what a private key is. This also extrapolate as forcing you to give up your PIN from your bankcards. The robber forces you to give up your digital credentials, if this is for fiat or for crypto, it does not matter for the robbery. Hence, crypto is as safe as credit cards.

Sad but true, the legal cutoff for 'not having to declare cash' is the 10k equivalent however. Many border agents start freaking out about carrying a couple of thousand, and demand justification from you. This is honestly far from 'reasonable doubt' that this amount of money is/will be used for illegal transactions. Even if I say I will buy 9 999 USD worth of cocaine in Thailand, this should be of no concern of the US border control or any internal agencies (if I am a US citizen - or any other citizen). All they can legally do at that point is which me a pleasant trip, there is no single illegal activity there.

You can not destroy (or manipulate) the ledger, one of the core features of a global, decentralized network. All bitcoins are somewhere on an adres, registered on the blockchain. The only thing you can do is destroy everything that would give someone acces to that adres. This would inherently mean that this bitcoin can not be moved from its adres, that it can not be spend. This would effectively decrease the total amount of BTC available for trade, and would make every remaining BTC a little bit more valuable, assuming other things in market valuation stay the same. 
There are probably thousands or even millions of BTC, that were mined in the early years, for which the private keys are not recoverable. At that time, BTC did almost have no value, and people did not care enough to keep records, or transfer their wallet off a computer that went to the dump.

Do you have a source on this? 
According to what I find, 50% of global wealth is owned by 1% of the richest people in the world. 
There are about 32 million (december 2018) bitcoin addresses, which is an absolute upper limit of the amount of users. The # users is more likely to be 13-15 million, but because it is bitcoin, and not centralized, exact data on this can not be gathered. 
There are currently around 17.5 million bitcoin circulating. 
Assuming similar centralization as fiat (50% of bitcoin in 1% of wallets) we should have 8.75 million bitcoin in the richest 320 000 wallets.

Sad but true. I tend to think of most people on this forum as extremely ahead of the mass public. Except for a couple of "hodl moon; when lambo" comments there is a good discussion about Bitcoin. At the moment it requires a huge amount of technical understanding. It might seem trivial for many of us, but I helped my mom update whatsapp on her smartphone while talking to her on the landline, and this took more than half an hour... The moment my mother will pay for her groceries through her smartphone is a long, long, long way off. At the moment, in my country, we even have the possibility to pay in most grocery stores through QR code. At the moment this is linked to a bank account, but the infrastructure for bitcoin would only need to change behind the customer facing interface. There is also not much incentive to use bitcoin in my country, because banks are relatively trustworthy, they regularly pay their fines for money laundering and fraud. There is low inflation, there is a 'relatively' stable economy and there is the possibility for free peer-to-peer money transfer through your bank account. We're far off from adoption, give it another 10 years, by that time Argentina and Turkey will have gone into hyperinflation, and the key giveaway will be when Canada's dollar keeps on sinking in value, and people opt for a way out.

So,... if they seize my ledger, how will they ever find out what the wallet on there is. They will not be able to break the encryption, and I can forget the access code. It is harder than you think if you do your homework. 
Technically the coins are never in a wallet, all coins are on the blockchain. A wallet is basically a login and password for the webservice of bitcoin. 
I always think of that; it is illegal to travel across (most) country borders with 10 000$ (or a similar amount) of cash or monetary instruments. How many people travel with more than 10 000$ accessible through their credit and debit cards they travel with? How is that different from your hardware wallet, it is basically access to the funds without holding the funds. 
If someone confiscates your credit card, they do not have access to the funds available on it.

Honestly, I think 40% is on the high side. Something reasonable to me is to buy in with 5-10% on cost basis of your portfolio, if it sours to more then 25% of your portfolio, you should sell some in favor of income producing assets like stock or real estate or cocaine traffic. 
Everybody's risk exposure is different, a lot will depend on what other investments you have. To be fair, if you have $1-5 MM in todays dollars in your total portfolio, it would be stupid to be heavily allocated towards risky investments. You could live comfortably for eternity (well,... till you die) on this by drawing 1-4% of the portfolio yearly. If this is 40% in bitcoin, and there is and 80% drop in the market your portfolio would lose over 30% of its value. It is safer to focus on wealth preservation than accumulation. 
If your total portfolio is 10k-100k dollars, you can take it a bit riskier, because even a 80% drop in bitcoin will not affect your standard of living too much.

Because there is no way to prove which identity is tied to the wallet without cooperation of the wallet owner. Because a bitcoin wallet does not require personhood, and to sue, you need personhood. 
Crypto is borderless, permissionless. 
The transfer was not wrong. This was a complete valid transaction OP signed with his private keys and broadcasted to the bitcoin network. At that point he intended to send the bitcoin to the receiving address. Imagine if he would have made a typo in the address, who was he going to sue then?

Most likely either because Satoshi is dead, or the person(s) behind Satoshi destroyed the private keys. 
If her identity would have been revealed, in the early days of bitcoin, she would have ended up in prison for drug dealing etc... just like the silk road. It is a good thing there is no known person behind it.

It had bugs, it has not been hacked. It probably still has bugs, and I hope the developers stay ahead of the black-hat hackers. 
As far as I know (I am not the expert) there's only been one occasion where double spend could occur due to a branching of the chain, and certain blocks that could not be recognized by a certain percentage of the miners because of a configuration 'error'. 
Everything is hackable. It is very straightforward to hack bitcoin, and very simple. All you need is a fuckload and a shitton of hashpower to reach the majority for chain propagation.

Nuclear energy is however a source that is capable of supplying our energy needs for the foreseeable future. Oil is not. Gas is not. Solar is not. Wind is not. There are some good alternatives, but people do not realize what a massive amount of energy we're consuming. If you would put electric cars on the roads, and solar panels right next to the road to provide the equivalent kilowats, the solar panel strip needs to be 8 km wide.

It is good for bitcoin to be 'used' to buy things and pay with bitcoin instead of with fiat money. 
The Ledger is great for long-term storage, and keeping it very safe. However, it is a little bit harder to spend money through it, and takes a little bit too much effort for day-to-day transactions (like paying at starbucks).
The Buy-Use-Replace terminology adheres the philosophy that if you have the option with the merchant, use bitcoin to pay. If you don't want to 'spend' your bitcoin stash, buy new bitcoin shortly after you've used it. In this way, you support the bitcoin ecosystem, without it affecting your bitcoin stash, you replace it immediately.
For day-to-day spending, I would suggest a phone wallet like eclair or mycelium, or even bitcoin lightning wallet. You keep 100-200 dollar on that to spend, and you replace it if it is spend. This way, you're not only holding bitcoin, but actively using it, and supporting its adoption.

Stock market is not equal to fiat currency. There are good companies out there. It is an ideal moment to buy Boeing, there is upward potential in many companies. Buying stock means buying a part of future earnings in a business. The dollar is just a unit of account. If there is inflation, stock prices go up.
Holding fiat vurrency is fully manipulated. 
Holding cryptocurrency on the ither hand is a non-income producing investment. There are no dividends or goods produced out of bitcoin. You purely speculate on capital appreciation. I think there is upwards potential in the price of bitcoin, because at this point it did not fully realize its potential. It can be considered as paying into stock of a payment processor. But today I would not invest in VISA.... Unvestment is a lot about personal interpretation and valuations and diversification. Bitcoin is part of a balanced investment portfolio, next to stock, real estate and maybe bonds.

Bullshit. Losses or profits are in purchasing power. People sell to buy something better. This might be a medical bill, a mortgage payment, food or cocaine. Nobody sells an 'investment' to keep under your pillow. A good case to sell btc is when it appreciated soo much that it now takes a too large % of your portfolio. Then you sell some to put in a less risky unvestment or purchase an appreciating asset, or cocaine.
You're not selling because you don't believe it will go up. You're selling because it went up.

There should be no inherent control on what is possible or impossible on the blockchain. You should have the possibility to transact whatever you want, you just have to keep yourself secure.

Who cares what he does. Buffet is a different kind of investor. Bitcoin is not an income producing asset, it is a speculative asset. We can all agree on that, what most of us differ from Buffet's opinion on bitcoin is which way its volatility will go. 
Inherently, investing in real estate and company stock is investing in hard, income producing assets. Bitcoin is not one of them. I disagree with Buffet, and think bitcoin can be a part of a well diversified portfolio. I do agree with Buffet that he does not invest in something he does not understand. He does not need to take risks, he is fucking rich. He needs conservative, wealth preserving investments, not accumulating risky investments.

If you cut each piece in half again, how many pieces of pie do you have?
Now, do you have more pie because you have four pieces, or is the total amount of pie you have the same as what you started with?

It is not as easy as that. While I live in Canada, I do not have a passport of that country. I do have a drivers license. So after 3 months of emailing their support trying to explain that I do have a valid passport, but it is from a different country compared to my drivers license. And yes, my IP is not from the country my passport is from. They never wanted to verify me. So I decided to close my account. As I was never verified, and never did any transactions, I did not want my personal information lingering around a crypto exchange. You never know what the future brings, and I can not use it anyway, because they don't let me, for some weird reason. Most likely because they are not bothered. Anyway, I go to close my account, and they tell my I can not close my account because I am not verified. Fuckers. Honestly. Fuckers. How incompetent are you. Eventually got the helpdesk support to close my account after another 3 or 4 contact moments. It's been a pain. But my situation is quite unique.

To bitcoin, there is no outside money. Bitcoin is a protocol, it does not ban people, it does not exclude people or institutions. Currently there are some institutions excluding other institutions from entering. Bitcoin itself can technically be bought by anyone. 
I see how you conveniently forget about the 197 ither countries in the world. Bitcoin does not stop at the borders. Americana go to mexico for dental work and to canada for meds. They import illegal substances from aouth america,... Borders do not stop money ir bitcoin. Ever heard about the panama papers? The British virgin islands? What do you think will happen when the US 'outlaws' bitcoin (technically impossible to enforce).

We are going to tell our grandchildren about r/bitcoin and fiat money. It will be a fairy tale, much in the same way my grandfather can tell about this time, this one person in the city got a television. We're pioneering. Do all what you can to support. Little needs to be said, I went to another exchange that did eventually work. I buy my bitcoins and transfer them to my hardware wallet, I sign my transactions by plugging in a device in my laptop. I always choose btc when possible, and even would pick a service based on the fact they offer btc for payment. Keep spreading the word. Momentum will not be gained in the next recession, people are too risk averse. Momentum will be gained in developing countries without stable currencies (less stable then btc). Don't look at the price, see the network and the ecosystem evolve and get better. Adoption is the only option. Keep help push it to a critical mass.

If you invest according to the solid advice cnot more than what you can afford to lose" you will never have to sell. Why would you sell the best performing fraction in your portfolio? The only reason would be if you're overexposed because of massive appreciaton in the risky asset class. On the other hand, harvesting gains comes with a significant tax penalty (in some countries) that reduces the incentive to rebalance.
I know we shit on the guy here, but Buffet is right in saying that 'the stock market is a device to transfer wealth from the stupid to the patient' the same goes for the crypto market. If you were not stupid to invest money you actually need, you're not stupid enough to sell it.

You're saying months ahead. I am a little bit more conservative in my expectations and think it will be a couple of years, probably less then 5. By that time we should reach enough adoption to be considered mainstream, like 10-20% of all electronic payment transactions will be running over (a layer on top of) bitcoin. Before that there will be neither the infrastructure nor the demand to warrant this. Currently, in a practical sense, bitcoin is harder to use then credit cards. On top of that, people don't really care that much about centralization and debt based monetary systems as long as they can get their consumer goods. We will need a solid dent in the confidence in visa at the time bitcoin channels are ready to take over (cf. the bolivar). 
Even when payments are mainly channeled through bitcoin, banks will still be required (initially) for debt, mortgages, loans, investments,... which is the side where banks make most of their profits. Banks make not the most of their money through payment processing, visa and mastercard do. However, credit card companies are basically backed by a distributed debt over a large (financially illiterate) population, through their credit card debts. Bitcoin or not, these systems will keep on existing for several years. Hell, even in the USA there are a lot of people unbanked at the moment that still do everything in cash. We don't need full adoption, we need 5-10% to get going. If I know a coffee shop a block further accepts bitcoin, I'll do the effort to walk over there. There are just not enough people as crazy as us on this forum here. Just wait. 
Like Andreas says, next year on the thanksgiving table, mentioning bitcoin. Your uncle will say "hu? I thought bitcoin was dead last year" and you can answer, "no, it's still here, and stronger than ever (in infrastructure != price)."

Almost exactly the long term return of the SP500, including DRIP, not corrected for inflation. 
Saving instead of going into debt is always a good idea. In many countries, people rely a lot more on their own money and savings compared to the US, where they rely on the credit from banks. The amount of interest that flows to banks is ridiculous. 
Bitcoin will not be the only thing out there. It will be part of a new financial paradigm, it is not all solving. It is not equally distributed,... at least access to the network is permissionless. 
What bitcoin is doing, and I see this reflected a lot in the comments on this subreddit, is make people think about saving and investing, it makes them think and dream about financial stability and security. This is a good thing. Many people look at the fiat system en see the big enormous banks and buffet, bezos and gates and decide they will never be rich, so they might as well give up trying. What bitcoin is doing (one of the things), is giving hope, this is a good thing.

Our lord and savior Satoshi Nakamoto came up with bitcoin as a protest against bank bailouts. The bailouts were made necessary because banks were overleveraged. The bailouts cost everybody money, and only the banks the ones at the top, the ones risking the whole economy, are benefiting from it. Bitcoin is a counteraction against the greediness of large financial corporations. A public, open, immutable ledger is awesome. 
There is a remark to the headline of the times "Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks" embedded in the genesis block. Using leverage to speculate on bitcoin is possible, but you're not investing in bitcoin, you're investing in financial market derivatives.

The Rothschilds own about 3-4 times (depending on how you calculate) the amount of wealth that is in the whole cryptomarket (and we know that market cap in the crypto sphere is a ridiculous overestimation). You can be absolutely sure that by now, they have several millions in crypto-assets. It is stupid to not diversify, and they do not have stupid advisers. The upward potential compared to the relative risk is just worth it. 
They do not play silly games on small markets. They own income producing assets. Real companies, with real products and guaranteed returns. The only question is how much return. Don't be a fool. Bitcoin might make you rich, it probably will, I hope it does. But bitcoin will not take away old money. Old money is strong, and here to stay.

@_date: 2019-05-09 15:14:21
That is not bitcoin producing income. That is you trading it for something else, and it is your work and the exchange rate variability that produces income. It is not bitcoin. 
You can make money trading bitcoin, you can NOT make money holding bitcoin, you have to sell it at some point. However, bitcoin is not an income producing asset.

Don't stress too much. A lot of people are worth a lot of money, and there is very little news about them being beaten or kidnapped. You are not known to the world, the only thing known through KYC and AML is that at one point, you bought bitcoin. If you're really stressed, wash them on a decentralized exchange over monero or through coinjoin, and you'll be good to go. Implementations of second layer solutions increase fungibility and anonymity vastly. Obviously, your physical location and trust in your government will be an important factor. Coinbase only talks to IRS, at the moment not to other governments. If you really do not trust anything, you'll be in the domain of money laundering and smuggling cash. But then you would probably not ask reddit for advice. You buy a carwash and keep the money in a storage locker till you can wash it, there's a 5 season documentary about that on Netflix. There is at the moment no known occurrence of unfungible bitcoin. Every satoshi is traceable on the blockchain. But so far, they are all considered equivalent for every purpose. It is really hard to control this in a decentralized system any way. If the police finds traces of cocaine on your dollar bills, this does not mean your name is Pablo Escobar. Satoshi's are traceable, but this is not necessarily a bad thing. I am not aware of Antonopoulos ever saying fungibility is a problem. It might become a problem, but it is not. 
Have fun!

At least, someone thinks. Bitcoin will not replace everything. Bitcoin ~~will~~ is giving you options. You will need credit, this will not be bitcoin credit. Credit is basically a promise of future work. You pay back the money with your work in the future. There will be people underwriting this. This might even be possible on next-layer implementations. We'll see in the future.

People are not willing to break ethical laws. Everybody gives eachother tips on how to 'optimize' their taxes or how to cheat the man. Nobody is against breaking a law that does not seem fair.

It is all a matter of how likely you are to get caught, and the punishment on that.

I agree, bitcoin does not make you above the law. On the other hand, bitcoin does not make you a criminal either.
If you want to be a criminal, it is a lot harder to seize your keys for the government than it is to seize your custodial bank account... 
Bitcoin is, in its current form, a form of money, an asset,... It has monetary value. You are a citizen and are subject to the laws in your jurisdiction. Bitcoin however, can act globally.
A bit in the same way, an american citizen (from some states) are not allowed to smoke weed. If they travel to amsterdam, and do it anyway, there is pretty much nothing the US government can do about it.

Buy on a big, well known exchange. Coinbase is a good bet, as long as you do not keep your funds on there. They have a good usersbase, are US based (less likely to run away with your funds), have good liquidity (for now),...
There are others, as long as you do not click on a random banner for "but bitcoin here" you're probably going to be safe.

I am not sure what you mean. Real estate leads to rental income and company stock leads to dividend payments and stock appreciation. Obviously both have the risk to be a bad investment, but that is where your analysis and judgement as an investor comes in. 
You can argument, on the bitcoin subreddit, that this is all investing in the dollar. I would argue that it is not. The dollar is used as a unit of account. If there is inflation, rental prices in dollar go up, meaning you have the same real value in return. Something similar happens with stock; if the dollar is worth less, you pay more units of dollar for the same unit of stock. The dollar is not inherently required, it is just very useful for accounting. 
Even in the case of inflation or hyperinflation, real estate and company stock are the best assets to hold. Bitcoin is just like holding gold, stock is like a goldmine. 
True, in the short term, bitcoin will probably outperform the other asset classes, but as a way for a safe, non-risky investment, stock and real estate are objectively superior.

If the keys are held by someone else, Craig would not be able to do the stuff he was trying to do. These keys are certainly not held by a lawyer, we're talking about one of the great minds in cryptography in our era, I do not think their idea of safe-keeping is putting it with a lawyer, in the legacy legal system. Bitcoin is inherently anti-establishment. Lawyers or bankers are not one of the trusted parties to the inventor of bitcoin. Trust me on that. I am satoshi.

Don't blindly follow any links or any advice on reddit. Most people are nice and helpful, and are genuinely trying to help, but there are always bad apples who will want to run away with your bitcoin. I would say, trust, but verify. Take information from different sources and come to your own conclusions. 
My advice in 10 easy steps:
1) Don't buy more than what you are willing to lose. 
2) Buy weekly/monthly, doing dollar cost averaging
3) Don't look at the price. You'll get stressed. Don't get stressed, you're in it for the long run. 
4) Don't take advice from strangers (on the internet or anywhere)
5) Choose a well known exchange; many exist, coinbase and kraken are good examples. I am not going to include links. You can google them; don't click on the advertised links in google. Make an account on one of these exchanges. Obviously DO NOT USE AN OLD PASSWORD; do not use the same password as your emailaddress, don't use an emailaddress that was compromised before. Don't be stupid. If you're not sure what to do, educate yourself further and ask questions either to trusted parties or anonymous. Think for yourself. Activate 2FA or 2nd factor authentication on the exchange. This either works via an app on your smartphone or via sms. SMS is less safe; but will probably be appropriate for most home-users. The exchange does not offer 2FA? Don't use that exchange. It might be a good moment to set up 2FA on your email too, gmail allows this, other services too. And maybe consider it for your bank too. Only activating this will make you a less likely target. Most bitcoin 'thefts' are done through user stupidity, they convince you to give them access to your account, in one way or another. Don't EVER give ANYBODY your credentials. As you will not keep money on the exchange, not even your lawyer or executioner of your will need to know this. 
6) Before you buy, get a hardware wallet. Trezor and Ledger are the most popular ones. Buy it directly from the manufacturer if they ship to your country. If not, be very careful and you'll have to verify that you received an original device that was not tampered with. For the love of ~~god~~ Satoshi, don't buy the cheapest you can find on eBay. 
7) Initiate the wallet yourself, you will be asked or told by the device to write down a 12/24 word 'seed'. Do this, ON PAPER! Don't type it out, don't take a picture of it with your smartphone, don't email it to your partner/heirs, don't store it on dropbox,... NEVER, EVER, EVER, let that word combination touch the internet. Safest way to store it is to make sure no-one knows you have it or where it is. You can put it in a safe deposit box at the bank. Having access to these words will give you access to your private keys and your bitcoin. They are equivalent to your hardware wallet. If you lose/destroy your hardware wallet, you can restore access with those keys. Make sure (on of) your heirs knows about its existence and how and where to handle bitcoin. 
8) Buy some on an exchange.
9) Transfer it the same day to your hardware wallet. Your wallet will display an address, copy/paste it on the exchange and VERIFY the address on your wallet with the one on the screen. Man-in-the-middle attacks (unlikely) can swap out your address for another one while copy-pasting. This will be stored on your account with the exchange. 
10) That's it, sit down, relax and enjoy. 
Bonus: If you're a long, long, long term holder. At least yearly connect and update your hardware wallet. You might need to load new firmware/software to patch future vulnerabilities. If you read in the news this kind of hardware wallet is compromised; do not freak out. Buy a new (different) hardware wallet and restore your wallet from the seed words. Take your old hardware wallet, place it on a firm surface and use a 5 pound sledgehammer to reduce it's height to that of a credit card. Carefully sweep up the remains and put them in a blender, add a quarter cup of ice, and the juice of a quarter of a lime, blend for 30 min on max. Start the BBQ, poor whatever is in the blender on the hot coals. Capture the ashes, take a transatlantic cruise, and 1 week into the trip, drop the ashes into the ocean. This will make you completely invulnerable to being possibly hacked on a compromised wallet. 
Did you lose your seed words somehow, but still have access to your hardware wallet? Don't freak out. You can generate a new wallet, and transfer your funds to the new wallet. This can be done either on the same device or on a new device. 


That is smart. This is the most important and most smart thing you can do. 


Keep looking, keep educating yourself. You're way ahead of most people by considering these things and asking questions. 


Yes, hardware wallet and recovery seed words; kept safe. A steel plate can work for that, a safety deposit box is a good option. Don't keep them together, if you lose one (burned down house, theft,....) you still have the other and they are equivalent. 


Safety really depends on how much money we're talking about. The fact that you talk about hedging retirement and ask questions on reddit makes me think we're talking about a couple of $10k to a couple of $100k initially (if bitcoin has another 1000% bullrun, this might change). This is a good amount of money, but a lot of people have this. Don't stress. Keep it safe and sensible. The moment you get in the multiple millions of USD valuation, you'll have to reconsider things towards safety, but at that point, you let your lawyer and accountant vet a couple of cryptocurrency experts, make them come up with a plan, take the plan, hire another accountant and cryptocurrency expert and make them execute that plan, while you enjoy a thick cuban sigar on a private yacht in the Caribbean. 
Anonymity? Why do you need anonymity? If you're not a criminal, and just want your retirement hedged, there is no problem with letting the exchange know your ID. You don't want that? You can buy bitcoin at a premium on certain ATM's or on localbitcoins without requirement for ID. It can be a good idea to anonymise your bitcoin. There are several strategies for that, I think they will, at the moment, take you too far down a rabbithole. Don't be afraid, your ID is not on the blockchain. The exchange will keep track of it and might share the info with the tax services (depending on your location, and the exchanges location) There are not many countries where bitcoin is illegal. Do not stress about this. 
Still not sure? Still confused? Ask more, study more. If you don't feel comfortable; don't do it. 
In the end, you can always buy an SP500 ETF through a traditional broker, a fairly safe bet for retirement (but not recommended on @_date: 2019-05-09 21:08:48

How exactly would you ban bitcoin? Be specific. You would outlaw the internet? You would make radio waves illegal? You would shoot all carrier pigeons?
Or you would make it illegal to handle in? Like cocaine? That is working fine. 
Ah, no, you would make possession of bitcoin illegal. That has to be it. But the problem is, nobody possesses bitcoin, they only possess the knowledge on how to access a certain address to re-allocate the funds to another address, but bitcoin never leaves the blockchain. Wallets and keys are not physical.
Please, explain me how bitcoin will be banned, I am curious.
