It's all about managing risks.
All exchanges are secure, until they aren't.
Your personal storage is secure, until it isn't.
Who do you trust more?  Bear in mind that it won't take a lot of reading to learn how to store your own private keys with a high degree of security.  And exchanges have huge targets painted on them by both criminals and governments.

PayPal just isn't worth the risk.  You're more likely to have someone just give you the BTC.

If you think you will be *able* to get a QR code tattoo with a wallet public address that actually scans, think again.
To manage the required data, you need a V3 code, which is a 30x30 grid. That is a lot of detail, and accuracy is important.
In order to get the needed level of accuracy, each module needs to be about 1/8" square, and the placement needs to be as flat as possible -- QR codes do have error correction, but they are intended to be flat.  If they aren't, the modules no longer line up in the neat grid they are supposed to be in, and scanning becomes problematic.
To get a scannable Bitcoin public key as a tattoo, you're probably going to have to have it done at about 8 inches on a side, and the location would probably have to be between your shoulder blades, or possibly the hip or outer thigh.
I've done quite a bit of research on QR tattoos -- I know what I'm talking [about](

Ask Sony how Betamax worked out for them. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:44:33
Betamax was arguably a better system, providing higher quality images and video than VHS.  However, Sony (via non-technical limitations like licensing and content restrictions) made it more difficult and expensive for manufacturers to produce players for consumers.  Consumers were given a choice between an expensive player with less available content and higher quality, or a cheaper player with more content and lower quality.
The market ended up choosing VHS.
Without granting the point, it is quite possible that BTC is technically and/or politically superior to BCH.  However, to the average consumer, it is expensive and slow to use.  BCH is presenting itself as inexpensive and fast to use.
If I am a n00b, why would I pick slow and expensive?  And I'm not going to understand or care who is doing the mining, or the development.

If you do not have the private keys, you do not own that bitcoin.  You have an IOU.

My answer is that the "target value" (whatever that is) of Bitcoin, in the long term, is somewhere **outside** the range of $0.01 - $100,000.  Either end is possible, though.
If Bitcoin fails, then in fails hard.  You won't be able to give your coins away, even if you're willing to mine a couple of blocks yourself to make the transfer.
If it doesn't fail?  Then 21 million coins (a large percentage of which were lost in the early years) are a very small number of units to base what will (by definition) be a global network on.

Electrum is a very usable wallet.  Clean interface, deterministic address generation, active development.
If you're concerned about depending on a third party you do have the option of running your own private or public Electrum backend server.  However, you control your private keys.  The worst that the backend servers can do is refuse to propagate your transactions.

Electrum has code in it to transmit the transactions back and forth via QR code and web came.
Malware that runs on both systems and using a hidden channel through the USB stick is perhaps possible, but unlikely.  Similarly, I'll be concerned with USB firmware attacks when they start showing up "in the wild".  Hackers are much more likely to target Windows users running high value desktop wallets long before they're going to try to exploit an offline wallet running on a Linux host.
@_date: 2014-07-18 21:14:29
They'd have to get close enough for starters. You can also (I believe.) set a password for write protection.

If your offline cold storage computer gets a virus, nothing will happen, because it's never connected to the internet.
You've got $30k in bitcoin.  Go buy a $200 netbook, pull the wifi card and fill the ethernet port with epoxy.  Then look into installing Electrum in offline mode via USB stick or SD card.
Edit: Regardless of what method you use for cold storage, make sure you have multiple backups in different locations.  If your house and netbook burns down, it's nice to know you have a copy of the encrypted wallet file on an SD card in the safety deposit box at the bank.

If you're using paper wallets from bitcoinpaperwallet.com (ie: fold-up wallets with unencrypted private keys) be sure to test them.  My first set of laminated paper wallets that I made, I set the laminator temperature to high, which melted the laser printer toner of the private key text and QR code.  When I cut open the lamination, and unfolded the paper to reveal the private key, half of the ink stuck to the wrong side of the sheet.  The private key was unrecoverable.....

*You* might expect it to.  Hashrate has little to do with price.  On average, a fixed amount of Bitcoin is being created by the network.  The miners are trying to sell the coins they make.  The price is set by demand for coin, and what people holding coin are willing to accept.  If a bunch of miners are shut off, the hashrate goes down, and the remaining miners get proportionately higher payouts.


Existing miners will continue to mine.  People with more expensive electricity may opt to quit, or sell equipment to people with cheaper power.  Eventually things will reach an equilibrium where the network is run at essentially break even.  This may well mean that the current big, commercial mines fail.
For example, I'd be quite happy to run a rack of mining hardware that *cost* me $200 to run over the winter, if it would offset my heating costs by more than $150 or so.

I have an offline cold-wallet (Electrum on a Linux netbook that has the networking hardware physically disabled) that I store the bulk of my coin on.  The Electrum seeds and private keys are GPG encrypted on the netbook, and then moved off via USB for backup in various offline and online locations.
@_date: 2014-02-12 17:32:11
Yes, it is possible -  (So you're a bit late.)
However, I think the complexity is too high for the size.  The image he posted doesn't scan.  The smallest QR code that will accommodate a bitcoin URI (ie: "bitcoin:1blahblah") is version 3 code, which is 29 by 29 modules, or nearly 850 dots to get precisely correct.  Getting an accurate stencil placement that lasts for the whole process will be difficult, and the grid is small enough that the slightest distortion will be more than a scanning app can handle.
Relevant:  
My QR tat.  :)  It scans easily both in person and from the image.  After a lot of research, my suggestions for a *generic* QR tattoo:  Minimum size: 2.75 inches square.  Use a Version 1 QR code, which is 21x21 modules, with medium or high error correction.  This will limit you to 10-15 characters.  If it's a URL, use a domain you control -- tinyurl.com won't be around forever.  And place it in the flattest space you can find - if the code has curled with the skin more than a centimeter, the distortion will make scanning difficult.  I'd actually suggest making up a bunch of custom decals, and trying various locations.  And interview your artist carefully -- from an artistic point of view, a QR code is trivial, but it is an extremely technical piece to execute.

This isn't backing up your bitcoins.  It is moving them to more secure storage.
You should still be backing up your wallets -- make multiple copies of them, and store them securely in multiple places.
I personally feel I am more likely to lose or have paper keys damaged or stolen, so my preference is encryption.  I have all of my important wallets and keys encrypted, and stored on multiple servers and in several places in the cloud.  This includes the keys for my offline cold storage wallets, which have never touched the 'net in *unencrypted, plaintext* form.

[How-To: Building an offline cold wallet with a Raspberry Pi, Pidora and Electrum.](
@_date: 2014-06-10 18:54:39
As mentioned below -- offline, cold wallets.  If a private key is never on a networked computer, it cannot be compromised without a lot more work.
* Get a netbook, and install an OS of your choice and [Electrum]( on it.
* Shut the netbook down, open it up, and physically disconnect the wifi (and Bluetooth, if installed) cards.  Squish some epoxy glue into the ethernet port, just in case.
* Start up the netbook, run Electrum, and create a wallet.  (Don't lose the 12 word seed!)
* Copy the Master ~~Private~~ Public Key to a networked computer -- you can now use this to watch your offline balances, and create transactions to be signed on the offline computer.
* Laugh at the attempts hackers or the NSA to compromise your wallet.
Edit:  Public, not Private key.  Dur.
@_date: 2014-10-22 13:04:41
If Google wants (is legally required) to let the NSA, FBI, CIA, NBC,CBS, OMG, TLA into your account, they certainly don't need a 2FA credential to do so.
@_date: 2014-07-25 18:43:49
Different levels of security for different risk.
My personal level of risk that I'm comfortable with?
* Phone wallet (ie: Mycelium) - $200-$500.  Spending money.  But I really don't trust phone wallets much.
* Online desktop wallet (ie:  Electrum) - $500-$1500 or so.  Spending money, on my day-to-day Linux systems.  I'm pretty sure they are well secured, but can't really be sure.
* Offline wallet (ie: Electrum on an isolated, non-networked, dedicated netbook, or BIP38 paper wallets) - Everything else.  The private keys for this storage level have *never* been on a networked computer.  Safe from everything, unless there are problems with the random number generator that created the keys or seeds.
Oh, and all of the above has encrypted backups in multiple locations, and I have made arrangements for people to be able (with some difficulty) recover the passwords if I can't provide them.
@_date: 2014-07-03 17:41:23

Depends what you're comfortable losing.  I really think it's a bad idea to keep anything (money or coin) you don't intend to be trading with in the short term on an exchange.  There is a long list of exchanges and web-wallets that have disappeared and/or been hacked, taking their customers' coins (and sometimes cash) with them.
For average day-to-day (non-trading) use, a wallet on your desktop or phone is more reliable and more flexible.
And for long term storage of significant value, offline storage (either paper or software) is just as important.
@_date: 2014-06-16 20:32:26
Two suggestions:  If I turn off the instructions, but not the notes, the notes lines should expand to fill the space.  (Similarly, the margins on the instructions could adjust.)
The second is more pie-in-the-sky, but the ability to replace the instructions with our own text would be nice.  Bonus points for allowing BBCode, or some other minor markup allowing bullets, bold, italic, underlined and/or colored text.

What is to stop malware from noting browser access to blockchain.info and pulling the decrypted private keys out of the browser memory when a transaction is signed?  Not easy to do, but at least some of the people who write such software are *very* good at what they do.  And there isn't a piece of wallet software (online or desktop) that hasn't had a theft reported.
(Which is not to say that blockchain is bad -- it's one of the best web wallets.  But the only way to be perfectly secure is to make sure that the private keys in your wallet *never* touch the internet.)
@_date: 2014-03-04 21:32:27
Lightweight Bitcoin wallet.  No blockchain download required.  Also a deterministic wallet, so you only need to save the 12 word seed generated when you first create a wallet -- all future addresses associated with that wallet are derived from the seed.
It also has features that make offline signing fairly easy.  (Including a plugin that allows you to move unsigned and signed transactions between online and offline wallets via QR code.)

Altcoins are somewhat interesting.  But none of them will ever have significant value over Bitcoin without something catastrophic happening to Bitcoin first.
And you hit precisely the reason why -  bitcoin was first, and it's de facto the best.  There might be altcoins that are technically better, even now, but they are all worth a tiny fraction of Bitcoin.

The main concern I would have is reliably disabling the radios on the 'droid.  If an offline wallet makes a network connection, it should be considered compromised.  Also, I don't think the Android Electrum port is being kept up to date.
On the other hand, there are cheaper options.  An Electrum install on a [Raspberry Pi]( is a straightforward process.
@_date: 2014-06-26 17:10:57


Not necessarily. I could see having a "warm" wallet, with 2-3 coins in it, secured with multisig.  If I wanted to move  coin to my hot wallet, I would need to create and sign the transaction using both my home laptop and my phone (for example).  
Either could be (separately) compromised, but unless an attacker controlled both, I'd be safe from theft.

Ummm.  Was the wallet printed on a laser printer?  If so, have you tried cutting open a test wallet?
I did something much like this, and realized after making a dozen or so that 1) Laser printers print using ink powder melted to the paper and 2) Laminators can get hot enough to re-melt the toner.  The QR code (and text) of the hidden private key melted to the paper it was folded against and when opened, was rendered pretty much illegible.
What worked for me was an appropriately sized square of aluminum foil folded in with the private key (which also helps secure it by making it impossible to read by holding it up to a light source) and used the lowest temperature possible for laminating.

Sorry, I don't buy it.  Even QR codes with the lowest possible error correction can detect *and correct* around 7% incorrect pixels.
It is possible (in fact likely) that the initial binary string read from the image contains errors, but once the actual message is extracted from that string, it will either be correct, or give an error.
And even if this wasn't the case, the odds of a random string being a valid bitcoin address are around one in 2^32.

One of the first things the client does on startup is verify the block hashes on disk.  If there is a problem, the top hash won't match with what's on the network.  The design philosophy of the Bitcoin protocol and reference client could be summarized as "Trust no one, verify everything."

User validation is performed as follows :
* A specific status is returned to inform the user that a validation is pending
* The user unplugs the dongle
* The user plugs the dongle back into the computer (or a different computer / smartphone, tablet with USB host support, depending on how confident you are about the first computer integrity)
* The dongle "types" (as a keyboard) a summary of the action to be validated and a 4 digits PIN to be entered, which is unique to the transaction
* The user plugs the dongle back into the first computer (or just unplugs / plugs it again)
* The user enters the PIN to confirm user validation

Personally, I've bought some mp3s from RiffTrax.com, and an NFC implant from DangerousThings.com.  In both cases, small sites, and I contacted the seller who provided me a Bitcoin address to pay to.  Therefore I have bought both intangible goods and tangible goods, from people I don't know, and paid exclusively with Bitcoin.
So, "Not many people have bought much with Bitcoin yet." is more correct.  But the lack of absolutes really undermines the statement you are trying to make....

Bitcoin's "digitalness" is both it's strength and weakness...  I'm a Linux system admin with 20+ years of experience.  I run Linux on pretty much every computer I use.  And I stopped trusting them to be secure enough to store my coins on when they past around $5k in value.

More of a bug in a system that is just now seeing widespread use.  And the issue might be one of what information Google provides to the app.
The idea, I suspect (I'm not a dev) is that they don't want someone either entering or GPS locating to their home address, and complaining that the app published their location.  So they match to the nearest "general" location.  It's possible that when they do a call that says "Show me everything within 25km of this location." they get an empty list.  It happens.
As I said -- send a message to and you'll get a firm answer as to what the bug is, and probably have it fixed in the next update, which will likely be in a week or two.
And what city are you in?

I stopped trusting my systems to be secure enough when the exchange rate pushed my holdings past US$5k in value.
If you want your Bitcoins to be secure, you need permanently offline storage.  If the private keys (or the seed for a deterministic wallet) *ever* touches a networked computer while in plaintext, it is at risk.
Use your phone or your usual PC as a hot wallet with limited funds.  If you're lucky, you'll never lose any.  If you're not lucky, you'll only lose a small amount.  But keep the bulk of your coins secured in offline wallets.  That can be paper wallets (if generated correctly) or a dedicated offline computer running wallet software.

You have to enable the "QR Scans" plugin which requires the "zbar" package (and possibly zbar-qt, it's been a while).
This adds "Show unsigned txQR" and "Scan TxQR" to the Send tab.  ("Show unsigned" is only visible for watch-only wallets....)  Getting a good scan can be tricky due to the detail, though.  Some web cams just can't focus close enough.

Flatly impossible now, and will almost certainly never happen.  The only way grandma is going to use Bitcoin as it is used today is with a dedicated hardware wallet.  A software wallet by definition runs on a general purpose computer, which is impossible to completely secure.  If you are an expert, you can come close.  But still not perfectly secure, and the canonical grandma is far from an expert.
IMHO, this is going to be the *major* barricade to widespread adoption.  If the average person can't be confident that they won't be electronically robbed, they won't touch Bitcoin.

I see the issue...  No easy way to get the pubic address from a BIP38 encrypted private key.  I will have to sort something out, probably exporting *.ps print files.
First rule of offline wallets:  Never expose the private key on a networked computer.  The validate tab decrypts the BIP38 key, and you end up with a plaintext version of the private key in memory.
To do what I want, you'd have to allow me to enter the BIP38 key *and* a public key, and trust the end user (me) not to screw it up.  And I don't think that's really a good idea -- I won't get it wrong, but *someone* will.  :)

Multi-sig is very new, and very bleeding edge.  It does look like it might be helpful, though.  I suspect they are more cumbersome to use, as well.
With that said, I still don't like the loss of control of my keys that is required to use a web wallet.  And even the most secure online wallet, with multisig, 2FA and magic pixie dust is going to be less secure than an offline wallet whose private keys have never touched an online computer.

The bulk of my coins are in "cold offline storage" with Electrum on a netbook that was permanently disconnected (Wifi card removed and ethernet port blocked) from the internet before the wallet was generated.
There is a paired wallet installed on my workstation that can generate the public (but *not* private) keys.  I use this to verify balances, and when I want to spend, generate an unsigned transaction.  I then move that unsigned transaction (by QR code and webcam, or via USB) to the offline netbook, sign and move back to the online wallet for broadcast.  At no point are the private keys exposed to a networked computer.

Which is why, in addition to Electrum seeds, I also back up exported copies of my cold storage keys in WIF format.  It's possible that in enough time, it may become difficult to generate keys from a seed due to obsolescence, but if WIF keys cannot be read, it probably means that the Bitcoin they represent are no longer of value.

If you pay with Bitcoin, and the merchant accepts zero-confirm payments, you can leave 30 seconds later, too.
The difference is that after 10-20 minutes the Bitcoin transaction is functionally irreversible.  With a credit card, you can (at least try to) reverse the transaction for months, and the card companies tend to give the benefit of the doubt to the customer.
So, every day there are tens of thousands of transactions made with credit cards for purchases that are "large", in which the merchant will have to wait at least a couple of months to be *sure* that they will get to keep the money involved in each transaction.  Tell me again why they wouldn't be interested in a system that guarantees their payment within half an hour?
Keep in mind that double spends are hard.
So, for a $2 coffee, most merchants will accept the risk that one in every few thousand transactions might be reversed.  They likely already see a higher percentage of CC purchases reversed.  Buying a computer for $500 or $1000?  Your merchant might want to see (and record) some photo id.  Or wait for a confirmation.  Buying a house or a car?  Yeah, your merchant is probably going to wait for five or six confirms, because the risk is much higher.
And there are other options.  Want to make some money?  Set up a multi-signature wallet service.  Charge the customer 0.25% to have you guarantee their transactions.  You build a business reputation that you will always counter-sign a customer transaction, but will never counter-sign a transaction that is a double spend.  Any merchant that receives a payment from a customer that needs to be co-signed by you can rely on it.  (And with multi-sig, you don't have the ability to steal money from your customers....)

The 12 word seed isn't a private key in the usual sense.  It is the random number from which all future private keys for that wallet are generated.  It needs to be well protected, as an attacker can use it to steal any and all coins placed in any address in the wallet, regardless of any password placed subsequently on it.
Just use any solid encryption utility, such as GPG ([Gnu Privacy Guard]( to protect it.

False.  I am personally responsible for maintaining and verifying the accuracy of two block chain ledgers.  My copies have no more (or less) say in the validity of a transaction than any other copy.


Nope.  You create a key by picking a random number, and using some math on it.  Yes, bitcoins never leave the block chain ledger, but they move around in it quite a bit.  When you "buy" bitcoin, someone uses their key to prove that they have the authority to change the ledger and move bitcoin value from their address.  The could assign it to any address, but they choose yours.  That value is now associated with your address in the bitcoin ledger.  It will remain there until you assign it to another address, which will require your key and more math.


Keys are not exchanged.  People assigned their bitcoin value to MtGox (or any other Bitcoin exchange) addresses and were given a balance in a MySQL database.  As they bought and sold on the exchange, the balance values in that MySQL database changes.  At some point, people would ask MtGox to assign bitcoin value to their address, based on their MySQL balance, and MtGox would then move value from their (Gox) Bitcoin address to the customer's address.  The customer Bitcoin balances, and any on-exchange transactions never touched the Blockchain.
The problem with MtGox is that (through malice or incompetence) they let the balances in the MySQL database drift away from their bitcoin balances, such that they owed more bitcoin to their customers than they had.  This is why more experienced Bitcoin users will tell you never to use an exchange for a wallet, and that if you don't have the private keys for your bitcoins, you don't actually have any.  You have a promise from a company to give you a certain amount of bitcoins in the future, which they may or may not be able to do.

It's quite likely that this attack hit my miners a couple of months ago...
I got an alert from my pool monitor that my hashrate had dropped to zero, so I assumed my network had dropped, or the laptop had locked up.  So I ssh'd in.  Nope.  Still running.
On the other hand, the pool difficulty was at around 1k, which was far more than the 64 or 128 that it usually runs at.  WTF?  Further investigation shows that the outbound network connection for the miner was to an unknown IP address.  And more interestingly, the *mining url reported by the miner had changed*.  WTF again.
An hour or two of checking logs on several machines (the miner wasn't directly accessible from the internet) looking for suspicious entries leaves me with reasonable certainty that none of my boxes had been compromised.  But the pool target had been changed.  WTF number 3.
Off to IRC and chat a bit with the pool developers, and some other people, one of whom was experiencing the same problem.  It turns out that the stratum protocol used by a lot of pools and miners has an API that allows the pool to tell the mining software to use another URL.  (And apparently some mining software has since been patched to ignore this request.)  WTF number 4.
So it appears that the attack was to identify the established connection between the pool and the mining software, and inject packets in the conversation telling the miner to change it's stratum pool url to the rogue pool.  Then the miner would continue on it's way.  I lost 2-3 hours of mining to the attack.  Not very significant, but thought I'd share.
I expect I'll get a few replies telling me I'm FOS.  I'm not surprised -- I wouldn't have believed this either, without seeing it in person.  FWIW, I'm a professional Linux system admin.

Depends.  The natural state of mining is going to be barely breaking even with electricity use.  If you need to average 10-15BTC reward to pay for the electricity used, then it doesn't matter if you mine 100 transactions that have a 0.15 BTC fee or 10,000 transactions that have a 0.0015BTC fee.  But if you're mining a significant amount of low fee transactions, and can't pay the bills, you shut down.

If you had $50,000 in cash -- 2,500 $20 bills -- how would you store it?  Would you carry it around with you in a wallet?  Stash it behind your sofa?  Or would you spend a few hundred dollars on a safe, buried in the floor of the basement?
Also:  When you went down to the store to buy groceries, would you take the entire $50k with you?  Or would you take $100 out of storage?
I keep a couple of hundred, at max on my phone.  $1,000-$1,500 in a hot wallet on my desktop.  Funding the phone is trivial.  I keep the rest of my coins in offline cold storage.  It takes me maybe 10 minutes to transfer coin from storage to the hot wallet.

You're funny.
Bitcoin price is volatile because there are maybe a few tens of thousands of active players buying and selling.  There are few enough people that large players can move the market significantly, and have done so on multiple occasions to their profit.
You *might* be able to make some short term predictions by watching day-to-day news items.  Mid term estimates are flatly impossible due to the volitility and random events that affect Bitcoin.
Long term?  If Bitcoin is successful, to the moon ( ┗(°0°)┛ ) is really the only possible outcome.  If it's not, then Bitcoin will be worth fractions of pennies.  But whether bitcoin will succeed is anyone's guess.

Unless they are lying, blockchain does not have a plaintext copy of your private keys.  They have an encrypted copy that is sent to your browsers, and decrypted there.  Blockchain never see the decrypted copy.  (Again, unless they are lying.  Which is pretty unlikely.)
What is more likely is malware on your PC which finds some way to pull a copy of the keys from the browser and/or make a transaction on your behalf.  I am not really convinced that 2FA protects against malware in this case.

Encryption is hard to get right.  I wouldn't trust Kingston (or any other flash drive vendor) to not make a silly coding mistake, which compromises the encryption.  And it does happen -- see the [Android RNG bug]( that led to the theft of a huge number of coins.

So, I have some experience. :)
tl;dr - No. A wallet QR code is too complex.
QR codes are meant to be applied to flat surfaces. There are very few truely flat places on the skin. If you want a QR tattoo that actually scans, you should look at one where the modules are around 1/8" square. Which means you want the smallest code available (21x21 dots) and around 2.75" square. You can find pictures of smaller and more complex codes, but they tend to be very difficult to scan.
I suppose a wallet is not out of the question, but it would probably have to be a back piece, and 4-6 inches square. Anything less will likely be more for show than anything else.
ETA: Mine is a URL on my personal domain. Once it hits my home web server, I can bounce it wherever I choose. I can redirect it to a "bitcoin:1blahblah" URL, but that only works if scanned and sent to a browser. Trying to scan it with a wallet app fails.

Coinbase does not give you the private keys that hold your balance.  You therefore do not own any Bitcoin -- Coinbase does.  Coinbase has promised to give those coins to whoever you tell them to, and only when you tell them to.  You have to trust that they will honour that IOU.  But what happens if they are hacked?  Or the government tells them that they must get a name, address, phone number and blood sample before they can release any coins?  Or if the admins get greedy and just run off with everything?
Unlikely, yes.  But not impossible.  And it has happened before -- Google "mtGox".
On the other hand, if you use a proper wallet -- Electrum or some other software -- *you* are responsible for ensuring security.  Your computer can be hacked.  Your media could be destroyed.  You could forget your password.  But such instances would be *your* fault, not someone elses.

"Online cold storage" is an oxymoron, and you are just a moron if you are trusting large amounts of Bitcoin to a web service provider.

It doesn't need to be brand new, as long as it stays offline. 
You boot up your compromised pc, generate and print a paper wallet, and the malware immediately steals the private key. And does what with it? With no network there is very little to worry about.   Just remove the wifi card from the netbook, and block the Ethernet port, either with a trimmed plug that will be very difficult to remove, or epoxy, which will be impossible. 
If you are looking at dedicating a netbook for such a purpose, you might check out Electrum. It has features that make offline signing and other cold wallet operations fairly easy.

You don't have a wallet on an exchange.  You get given a funding address, which feeds into the exchange's account, and when you send Bitcoin to it, your balance in a (MySQL/Postgres/etc) database is increased.  When you withdraw, your balance on the database is reduced, and you're paid out of the exchange hot wallet.
Which is why you should never use an exchange for day-to-day storage.

You are one malware infection away from losing coin.  It could be something as simple as a clipboard attack that changes any address you send to, to the attacker's address.  Or as complex as something that reads the private keys from your browsers memory..
You should not trust more than you would be comfortable losing on a network-connected Windows computer.  For larger amounts, at bare minimum, you need too look into a Live CD/Live USB based OS (Probably Linux of some sort) to be booted only when your PC is physically disconnected from the network, and use this OS for the bulk of your Bitcoin.  Either run an offline wallet like Electrum or Armory, or use it to generate paper wallets.  (Also make sure you generate multiple paper or encrypted backups.)
@_date: 2014-03-11 22:19:37
Yes, but if the account is compromised in real time, that's irrelevant.
* Malware infects PC and transparently redirects coinbase.com to an attack site that looks exactly the same.
* Attack site prompts for userid and password.
* Attack site sends userid and password to coinbase, coinbase asks for 2FA.
* Attack site prompts for 2FA.
* Attack site sends 2FA, and checks balance.
* If balance is not worth (yet) attacking, attack site allows client to use coinbase as usual.
* If balance is worth stealing, have coinbase transfer to attacker's address.
There are other vulnerabilities as well.  I read about one piece of malware the other day that just monitors the copy buffer for bitcoin addresses.  If it sees one, it replaces it with an address of the attacker. That's almost a social engineering attack, and will get past virtually any software and hardware security....
@_date: 2014-07-28 16:58:02
You'd still be carrying around a private key.  It makes more sense to use Mycelium as a hot wallet, and only fund it with a day or two worth of coin.  Mycelium is my (phone) wallet of choice, but I don't personally trust it with a lot.  The value on the phone is protected by only a 6 digit pin, which seems weak to me.  I also don't trust the phone OS as much.


Electrum does this, to implement offline cold storage.  You keep the bulk of your coins in a wallet that has never (and will never) be connected to the network.  On a networked computer, you keep a related wallet, created with the Master Public Key of the offline wallet -- this "watch only" wallet can create all the public addresses of the offline wallet, but has no private information an is therefore safe.  To spend, you use the watch-only wallet to create an unsigned transaction, which you move (and Electrum gives you the option to send the transaction via QR code) to the offline wallet, which has the private keys to sign it.  You then move the signed transaction back to the watch-only wallet and broadcast it.

I think they definitely look pretty.  But other than "Look at my shiny Bitcoin wallet, how cool am i?" I don't think they're worth much.
If you **strongly** encrypt (GPG, BIP38, etc) your seed, software wallet file, or Bitcoin private key, you can then store it in multiple locations, either in hard copy on paper, "semi" hard copy in a thumb drive or virtually in email or cloud storage.  One of the key points is *multiple* locations.

* Your CryoCard wallet is destroyed beyond recovery in a fire/flood/theft incident.
* The encryption used by GPG or BIP38 is compromised.

You misunderstand what "cold storage" is.  Both Blockchain.info/wallet and Mycelium require an online device to use and are not cold storage by definition.
Cold storage, by the common Bitcoin definition, requires that the private key for the bitcoin storage be generated offline, and remain offline.  OP's private keys have never touched the internet, and even if the machine that he is using for cold storge is infested with a dozen varieties of malware, and 10 different keyloggers, it is impossible for them to leak that information, as the USB key is never booted on a networked computer.
*Your* "cold wallets" do not have this feature, and are (at best) "rarely used hot wallets".

Unrelated to multisig -- look into the vanitygen documentation.

I've been messing with the drawing functions in the code, and using the full 971 pixels of the canvas you've defined works well enough for what I'm looking for, but it seemed reasonable to make a feature request for.  Trying for a canvas larger than 971 pixels breaks the placement of the QR codes and other features, though.
If I'm feeling ambitious, I'll see if I can parameterize my changes (which will require changing the location of all of the elements from absolute Y values to an offset from an arbitrary centerline) and send a patch...

This is called arbitrage.
If it was as easy to move fiat between exchanges as it is to move Bitcoin, the price difference between them would be negligible.
Your best bet would be to get to know the individuals who own and run the exchanges you are interested in, to the point where you send and recieve cash outside of the normal exchange funding channels (FedEx bundles of money?) which will reduce the time required to move the fiat.  Maybe ask them to drop their exchange fees while you're at it.

It looks great.  Until you fold it up, and the flap containing the private key covers the face of the figure...  The removal of the random black and white pattern to make room for the "In Blockchain We Trust" will make the private QR code vulnerable to candling as well.

If you can't export a copy of the private key for the address you're using, you don't control the Bitcoin stored there.
Very few web-based Bitcoin services leave you with that control.  Blockchain.info/wallet is an example of a wallet that does.  eligius.st is a pool pool that (mostly^*) does this.  But it's difficult to impossible to build a business around bitcoin without having full control over it, so most simply don't.

The source for Mycelium is available for review, but under a closed license -- you can't use it for anything.
The main thing as I see it, is that Mycelium is an Android app.  In order to use it at all, you need to run it on a **network connected** phone.  Electrum can be run in an offline mode, which *guarantees* that your private keys will remain private.  (Offline cold storage is of course optional, and can be a bit of a headache.)

No.  When using Electrum in offline mode, you generally create an **On**line "watch only wallet" paired with the offline wallet -- this is what the Master Public Key is for.  The watch-only wallet contains no private key info, but can generate all of the public receiving addresses.  Any of these receiving addresses can be used to send bitcoins to the offline wallet.  But in order to move bitcoins *from* the offline wallet, the transaction needs to be signed on the offline netbook.
To do this, you use the watch-only wallet (which is online, and can look up all of the balance info from the blockchain) to create a transaction.  It doesn't have any private keys, though and cannot sign it, so you copy the transaction to a USB key (Or use QR codes and webcams) and move it to the offline netbook.  The offline wallet has the private keys, and can sign the prepared transaction, which is then moved back to the online wallet, which broadcasts it to the bitcoin network.
Full transaction capability, but the private keys never touch the internet.  For that matter, the offline computer can be fully compromised, but since it is permanently disconnected, there is no way for key information to leak, even if it is collected.

There are areas of storage on the android platform that are considered "secure".  Apps are not allowed to read or write directly to them.  Your wallet apps will use this storage for information like private keys.
On a rooted phone, an app can ask for (and be granted) root privileges, at which point there are very few parts of the phone that they cannot access.  This is why Titanium Backup requires root -- so it can read the app apk files, and back up all of the data associated with each app.  The problem is that such an app can therefore read (and write) your wallet's secure data.  Which may be encrypted.  But probably not very strongly.
So the attack goes something like:

The dollar (or whatever you call your local fiat currency) is backed by the local government who promise that that dollar will exist in the future and can be used to pay any debts, in particular the taxes that government chooses to levy.  There is no guarantee made about the relative buying power of that dollar in the future.  What costs a dollar today may cost two dollars in a year.
Gold (or whatever comodity you want to consider) is backed by the fact that it is difficult and expensive to get, and cannot be faked or counterfeited.  Value is whatever the market agrees on.
Bitcoin (or whatever cryptocoin you prefer) is backed by the fact that it is mathematically impossible to counterfeit, supply is mathmatically limited to a known amount, and supply is increasing at a known mathematically limited amount.  Value is whatever the market agrees on.

Blockchain.info (in *theory*) never has access to your private keys.  They are encrypted and decrypted in your browser -- blockchain only ever sees an encrypted version.
Where does the Javascript that does the crypto come from?  blockchain.info.  You need to trust them to be secure enough to protect those Javascript files from malicious changes from either internal or external attack.  It would not be impossible for those files to be changed to have your browser send the decrypted wallet somewhere.
Blockchain.info is a trusted part of the community, and seems to have a clue when it comes to security.  They are certainly *much* safer than a web wallet or service like Coinbase or Circle, where you do not control your own private keys.  All things considered, they may be safer than a desktop wallet run on an internet connected computer -- they probably are better at security than the average computer user.  But they are definitely less secure than a properly implemented offline cold wallet.

My guess is that the way this is intended to work is that the XT fork gets patched to implement large blocks once a supermajority (90 or 95 percent?) of the most recent blocks are flagged as being from miners that support that feature.
Several weeks or months pass, and it is noticed that a significant portion of the payment processors are using the -XT fork, and a significant portion of the blocks being mined are from -XT forks and support large blocks.
The Bitcoin Core devs note that Bitcoin users (processors and miners) have decided (by voting with their software installs) that large blocks are a desired, and implement the large block rules previously added to the XT fork.
Once the supermajority is reached, and the first block larger than 1MB is accepted, everyone who is not using a large block bitcoind (or using a service that hasn't upgraded) will find themselves using an altcoin that looks like Bitcoin, but isn't recognised by 90 or 95% of the network.
Alternately, the large block XT fork is released, and doesn't see much adoption.  Bitcoin Core keeps moving forward as it does now, and Gavin tries again.

The phone creates an unsigned transaction, using the public keys in the wallet.  It sends this unsigned transaction to the card via NFC.  The card (which has the private keys) signs the transaction.  It the sends the signed transaction back to the phone, which broadcasts it.
This makes it virtually impossible for an attacker to get your private keys.
It does *not* protect you from a rogue app that changes the transaction from "Send 0.02 BTC to Humble Bundle." to "Send my entire balance to some Russian teenager."

One reason that is getting more and more relevant is privacy.  If you've used your credit card in the last year or two at a (US located) Target or Home Depot, then your credit card credentials (and possibly more than just that) are likely in the hands of people who will abuse them.  Or will sell them to someone who will abuse them.  This is flatly impossible with Bitcoin.
Secondly, while *acquiring* Bitcoin is somewhat difficult (although it's getting easier) spending it is trivial.  Particularly for online goods.  Spending Bitcoin is easier than spending via credit card or spending via PayPal.

There are wallets that use a randomly generated seed (usually expressed to the user as a mnemonic) to generate the keys for that wallet.  The addresses aren't protected by the mnemonic, though.  For protection the random seed is encrypted with a wallet password.
Generally speaking, it is not possible to derive the private key or the random seed that generates it, based on a given address.
There is an issue with deterministic wallets, though, if you get into some of the advanced uses.
One feature of such wallets is that you can create a "Master Public Key" from the random seed.  This number allows you to generate all of the wallets *public* addresses -- useful watch-only wallets, or for giving out payment addresses on a merchant page, for example.  This is useful, but much of the documentation that exists treats the MPK as unimportant, and not requiring any protection...
However, if you have the Master Public Key, and somehow manage to get access to a private key from a single address in the wallet, it is trivial to derive the original random seed value used to create the wallet, and you then get full access to every address in the wallet.
tl;dr - Be careful with the Master Public Key for a deterministic wallet, and *never* share *any* private keys from any wallet.
@_date: 2014-10-29 19:43:49
Message signing and transaction signing are different topics that use mostly the same idea.  You can use your private key to produce a "signature" -- basically a blob of text -- for any piece of data that can then be verified using the public key.  In a bitcoin transaction, this is used behind the scenes to prove that you have the authorization to move coins from an address.  Message signing just lifts the functionality that is a required part of any client, and allows you to prove control of an address, or validate a message.
For example:
Public address:

A huge drop in difficulty might happen if *everyone* had the same power costs.  But this isn't the case.  A difficulty that means a miner in one market is operating at a loss doesn't mean all markets are.  A commercial mine in California is going to be unprofitable long before a mine in Washington.
Also, commercial miners are going to drop out long before they actually become unprofitable.  If the overhead on the datacentre is $50,000 per month, and is only netting $1000 in profit, it'll probably go.  Such decisions will be made on a per-location or per company basis.
So yes, I suppose it's *possible* for the network difficulty to drop by 80%.  But for that to happen in the space of one retarget window?  Nope.

Yup.  Miners can ignore or include transactions as they choose.  They can even include illegal transactions, but if they do that, no other nodes will accept such blocks.


All (mining) nodes are all working on their own version of block "X".  The included transactions don't have to (and in practice, probably don't) match.  Once a node finds a winning hash, it announces it to the network:  "I have found block X!  Here it is!".  All other nodes check the math, and if it's correct, start working on block "X+1".
It's also possible for two miners to submit equally correct (but different) blocks to the network at the same time.  When this happens (and this is an over-simplification) the one seen and accepted first by the most nodes becomes the defacto node "X".  The loser gets orphaned.


It happens.The work isn't in finding transactions to include, it's finding the right hash, so there is no incentive to ignore transactions.

Transactions not included remain in the pool until they are included in a future block.  They will eventually age out if no one wants to mine them (a very tiny output with no fee, for example) but that may take days.
When a block is being built, all of the included transactions are put together, and a hash is taken of them.  The result of this hash is placed in the block header.  This operation is dependant on the number of transactions in the block, and might take a respectable fraction of a second. On a slow PC.  The block header is then hashed trillions of times, each time with a slightly different random number, looking for a hash with enough leading zeros to qualify.
One place where size is arguably relevant is in network propagation.  It may be faster to send a ~100k block across the network than a 1MB (or 20MB or more in the future).  There is work being done ("invertable bloom filters",  whatever the hell those are....) to moot this issue.

The current "suggested" fee is around $0.05 per transaction.  It could grow or shrink.
The current network can handle a theoretical maximum of 7 transactions per second, although  half that is more reasonable.  (And this limit is arbitrary.  Work is being done to safely increase it.)  That means that *today* miners could be seeing $600-$1000 per hour in transaction fees, although what is actually happening is closer to $200 per hour.
PayPal sees around 400,000 transactions per hour.  If Bitcoin matched that volume, at $0.05 per transaction, miners would be splitting $20,000 per hour or nearly half a million dollars per day.
As the block rewards taper off, adoption is likely to increase, and more than offset the loss.  And if adoption doesn't increase.....  Well, then there won't be much point in mining.  :)

Read what Gavin suggests.  He's suggesting hard fork that takes place once a certain block height is reached **AND** 80% of the network is running the new code.
So, if there is a dissenting group, it can block the fork by having more than 20% of the running bitcoin nodes (Nodes, not &gt;20% of the hashrate).  If they have less than 20%, they'll get left behind almost immediately.
Edit:  This isn't quite right.  Correction below.

Doing so would require the agreement of more than 50% of the operating Bitcoin nodes.  Not going to happen.

Yes, but keep in mind that a hash of the included transactions is part of the header.  And other nodes won't accept the block without the transactions, so they can verify the math.

People who pre-order without looking at the history of ASIC miners deserve what they (don't) get.
My miners (V1 ASICs) have paid for themselves, and are still earning more per month than their electrical costs, and probably will for another couple of months.  The major mining players, who have hashrates in the dozens or hundreds of TH/s are probably making their own V2 or V3 ASICs, and are well aware of what it will take to break even.  However, in another year, there will be no more to wring out of the silicon -- the V3 or V4 ASICs will be as small, cool and efficient as current technology will permit, and anyone who is running them at that time will have to shut down or move somewhere with cheap power, because power costs will determine who is barely profitable and who is losing money.  And at around this time, the growth of difficulty will finally start to plateau.


This statement is far from certain.  I wouldn't bet my house that Bitcoin will succeed, but I think that (at this time) it is more likely than not to.  And if Bitcoin does succeed, we will look back on a $650 price the way we are currently looking back at the $5.00 Bitcoin from 2 years ago....

An Electrum wallet seed wil regenerate all addresses that that wallet will ever generate.
So if you have an offline wallet with 200 (or 2000) addresses with funds associated with them, you can build a new offline PC with virgin media, install Electrum, and regenerate the wallet based on that seed, and you'll have access to all of the funds.
About the only thing that can't be restored from seed are address labels, and any imported (ie: vanity) addresses.

Yeah, all other investments have to follow these same rules. The difference with crypto is that the people involved are generally not familiar with tax law, and deals with instruments that have seen triple digit gains over the course of a couple of years...
@_date: 2019-06-30 16:48:41
is, IMHO, correct.
Yes, legally, we are required to report CG on all transactions. There are no official exceptions for small amounts, and you certainly have a legal obligation to report and pay tax on the $12 in gains for the Bitcoin purchase of avocado toast that you paid $0.10 for, 5 years ago. But in reality, no one cares about such small amounts, and even the taxman isn't going to care.
However, if you buy that Lambo for Bitcoin that cost you $500 a few years back, and the taxman finds out, they are going to very definitely want their cut.
@_date: 2019-06-27 23:17:41

@_date: 2019-06-27 22:58:13
Technically, it's a barter transaction.  Basically you would process it as though you exchanged your crypto for fiat at whatever the current market rate is that day, and calculate gains based on that. 
Probably not worth bothering for small transactions. But when you buy your lambo with the crypto you paid $20 for...

There was no rollback.  The devs got enough miners off the other fork that it was abandoned.  The current block chain has a block roughly every 10 minutes through the event in question.

As has been pointed out, yes, a collision is technically possible.  But the human brain really isn't suited for understanding the size of the numbers that show how unlikely it is.
There are 2^160 possible addresses.  You need to be able to guess (at random) the key that hashes to a selected address.  How hard can that be?
2^160 (which is a binary number) is equal to roughly 10^48.
The earth weighs around 6*10^27 grams.  Grains of sand range in weight  from 0.001 to 0.050 grams.  Lets make the math easy, and say that a grain of sand weighs 0.06 grams.
If we turn the entire earth into a grains of sand, the odds of you picking the same grain of sand that I have selected is one in 10^29.
In order to have the same odds as bitcoin addresses, you would have to pick a the random grain of sand from one of 10^19 earth-sized piles of sand.  This would be a sphere of just over 1.3 million earth radiuses.
The earth has a radius of just over 6300 kilometers, so the radius of the pile of sand would be around 8.5 *billion* kilometers.  The planet (?) Pluto orbits at around 7.5 billon kilometers.
So.  You want to find a duplicate to a particular bitcoin address?  Fill the *entire solar system* with nice white (and somewhat bigger than average) beach sand.  Somewhere in that volume is a single grain that, if you look closely at it, is black.  How long will it take you to find?
Edit:  I'm questioning my math now.  I'm not sure if it's 1.3 million earth *radiuses* or *diameters*.  So you might be looking at a sphere with a radius of twice the distance of the orbit of Pluto.  So it might be 8 times more difficult than I outlined above.
Edit2:  Wolfram Alpha:  $RADIUS_OF_SPHERE($(VOLUME_OF_EARTH) * 10^19) == 13.5 billion kilometers.

I don't think that "*They claim that Bitcoin Cash will actually replace BTC and take over its name, effectively becoming the new bitcoin.*" is too far from what many BCHers believe, tbh.  However, "*For this to happen, each exchange would have to unanimously agree on what the 'real bitcoin' is and the first exchange to switch their definition of bitcoin to BCH.*" is new, and not something I have seen mentioned.
But I don't think anyone believes that will happen any time soon, even if BTC's value drops to a fraction of BCH.  If BCH succeeds, it will be Bitcoin Cash for the foreseeable future, and will only become "Bitcoin" by common usage, if and only if it is the only "Bitcoin" that people care about.  Which is still far from a sure thing.

For a start, I'd suggest that if Bitcoin was as common an online payment option as PayPal, it could be considered a success.  If it becomes a defacto method of transferring value internationally (perhaps with some service running on top, hiding the details) it would be a success.  Even having it exist in 5 years with the same level of adoption it has today would be a small success.

Yes, but without the market support, miners can't do anything.  There was significant miner support for the 2X fork, but the market indicated that it would balk, so it didn't happen.
Similarly, there is ample mining support for both BTC and BCH, and fairly strong and significant market support for both forks.  In the long term, the market will dictate which of the two will succeed, and miners will follow.  
is correct:  No one group, -- miners, users, developers, merchants, etc -- can dictate what the network rules are.
@_date: 2018-03-27 15:28:54
Well, one way to look at it is that miners can't fork the network on their own, either.  They can only provide the potential for one.  They need transactions from users and merchants that are compliant with their new rules, and non-compliant with the old rules.
@_date: 2017-09-27 18:39:05
Long term cold storage should not be reusing addresses, and until an address has been spent from, not even the public key is public.  The address is derived from the public key, but not reversibly.  So a quantum attack against unspent inputs associated with virgin addresses is reduced to guessing at private keys.

It's still a bet, and not yet a sure one.
I'll be much happier in a year, once we are past all of the blocksize and segwit fork nonsense.  The next two or three months could well kill Bitcoin.  But if the current fight between miners and developers doesn't shake market confidence in Bitcoin (and a messy, long lived fork could do that) then I can't think of anything short of a massive and unfixable vulnerability taking it down.
It's a good bet, and I won't be selling any time soon.  But it's still a bet that could lose.

The creation of new Bitcoin doesn't involve prime numbers at all.  It's a standard transaction like most others, except that it doesn't have any inputs.  The miner says "Put X new bitcoins in this address.".
And the "math problem" solved by the block is more akin to flipping a coin 250 times, and hoping that the 250 flips starts with a string of 70-80 heads in a row.  You might even try to insert a description of hashing in there, too.

You can create a new coin, or fork a new version of an existing coin trivially.
The hard part is offering something something interesting enough that the market picks it up and starts to use it.
The fact that Cash is still around, valued at 10%-15% of BTC and decent transaction volumes suggests there is more market interest than can be explained by poor, hopelessly confused n00bs.  One way or another, it's going to be an interesting few years.

BCH shares the same genesis block.


No argument on that one.


*Bitcoin* is decided by consensus.  If there is a big enough division in that consensus, you will get a chain split.  BTC users are in consensus over how that chain should operate.  BCH users are in consensus over how that chain should operate.

Electrum is open source.  You are always going to be able to get a copy running, even if the Electrum servers no longer exist.  Once you have the wallet running, you can export the private keys into a more usable wallet.
But if you want *secure* and *long term*, then I think has the right idea -- BIP38 paper wallets.   Multiple copies, in multiple secure physical locations.  And make sure that the password(s) are (separately) stored in such a way that if you or your next of kin forget it, it can be recovered.

More a response to a lot of sentiment in the thread that Roger is evil, and the confusion caused by the "Bitcoin" in "Bitcoin Cash" is the sole reason for it's popularity.  I don't think so.  There was certainly PR reasons behind the choice of name, but if that was all it had, it would have much less market interest now -- Bitcoin Gold is a good example.  You can find some places that still trade it, but it's value is abysmal.  


That is a reasonable point.  Bear in mind it might well be applied to both sides of this discussion, though.


I don't think the BCH camp is completely averse to off-chain scaling.  Just that at the current time, it is not the appropriate solution.  My concern with BTC and LN is actually similar -- I suspect that the network model that will grow is that you will have most users (both buyers and sellers) connected as leaf nodes to large, well connected hubs, much like TCP traffic is with the current internet.  And those hubs will be vulnerable to both overt and covert attacks.  Centralization of one sort or another is inevitable as adoption goes mainstream.
TBH, I do think that BCH is more likely to come out on top in the long run, but it's by no means certain.  It may well be BTC or some other coin that wins out.  Or the whole concept may end up a failed experiment.  Ask me in a decade.  Or two.  :D

Actually, the true value, given future expectations means you need to factor in the future price.  **If** Bitcoin succeeds, then a price of $15,000 is probably conservative.  Using your numbers, true current value is $6.  Using mine, it's $7500.

Because doing it the old way takes 3 to 5 days to process, and is apparently opaque even to the banks using the system.  Using a blockchain-based system would reduce that to seconds, and would be more transparent, at least to the companies running it.
 






Because you need the sheeple.  If the banks come up with a product that is as easy to use and as reliable as Bitcoin, that doesn't have anything to do with drug, kiddie porn or terrorism (because we said it doesn't, go back to your Angry Birds game) it could well become more popular than that nasty hacker invention.

If you are using FIFO to figure out your capital gains, you're doing it wrong.  
You need to keep a running average price ("Adjusted Cost Base") that changes every time you make a buy. Your capital gains are  ((ACB * coins sold) - (Value of the trade - reasonable fees associated with the trade)).

It may well end in tears for the banks, forcing them to come back to Bitcoin once their private block chains fail.

I'd personally guess:
* Pa = 0.95 (It's been hammered on for 6 years.  A fundamental flaw is going to be pretty unlikely, IMO)
* Pb = 0.9 (Bitcoin has first mover advantage.  For an alt to succeed, first Bitcoin must fail somehow.  The most likely way this would happen would be FedCoin, or BankCoin or something.
* Pc = 0.9 (Bitcoin has already shown what may be good mainstream use cases -- international remittances and online payments for intangible goods to name two)
* Pd = 0.66 (Reddit isn't the Bitcoin community, and we are already seeing actors that will be much more accepted by the mainstream.  VC people like the Winklevii, the NYSE and others.)
So, using your formula with my numbers (which I pulled out of my ass, based on my opinions, *just* like you did) I get about a 50% chance of Bitcoin succeeding.

If **one** bank were to create a private blockchain, then yes, a shared database would be the easier solution.
On the other hand, if you can get a consortium of of a dozen or so international banks together who wish to securely exchange tokens, but don't necessarily trust each other, a blockchain might be a good way to do it.  You'd have to worry about a 51% attack, but I'm sure there are some technical ways that that might be mitigated.
The banks are many things, but stupid is not one of them.  Banks adopting a blockchain, but rejecting Bitcoin is not an unreasonable failure mode of Bitcoin.

In the beginning, there was the Internet.  Made and used by tech nerds and academics.  It worked surprisingly well, and they built a lot of stuff with it.  After years of being ignored as too complicated and not really useful for anything, it started to get noticed by groups outside of the tech nerd circles.
In particular, Big Business started to see that such a network might be useful.  But the Internet was a strange, difficult to use, messy thing that they couldn't properly control.  So AmericaOnLine (and other similar services) were created.  Fully controlled by big business.  Aggressively marketed to non-nerds and other businesses.  And walled off, so that their customers wouldn't bump into that nasty Internet.

Be prepared to learn about hash functions, digital signatures and p2p networks. I'm still only about 80% sure I understand how a transaction is built for broadcast....) 
If people don't understand something, they won't fully trust it. And of those that don't trust, some will be curious, and try to learn. Many others will just default to hostile. Particularly if all they have heard of bitcoin from the news is things like 'Ponzi scheme' and 'Silk Road'.

Which doesn't change the scarcity of **a** Bitcoin.
If you have $1000, but can only spend whole dollars, and a loaf of bread costs $0.50, then you have to buy 2 loaves of bread at a time, and can buy up to 2000 loaves.
Now, I can "fix" the situation by printing more dollars.  If I double the number of dollars in circulation, then you can now buy a single loaf of bread for $1.  But you only have $1000, so you can now only buy 1000 loaves -- your value has halved.  **Or**, I can change the system and let you spend pennies now, instead of whole dollars.  Now you can buy a single loaf for $0.50 (or half a loaf, if there is such a thing for $0.25) and you can still buy 2000 loaves with your value.
The core developers can make whatever changes they want, but they need to be adopted by the majority of users.  The majority aren't likely to make a change that makes their bitcoins less valuable, but would quite likely be ok with them being more divisible.

It's really pretty simple.  By 2035, 99% of the possible Bitcoins will have been mined.  There are really only two possible outcomes:
* Bitcoin is still around, and hasn't been replaced by something else.  It has clearly succeeded.  If this is the case, then the transaction volume will be such that a penny or two fee per transaction will give miners far more value than they are making today via the block reward.
* Bitcoin has failed or been replaced by something else.  No users, no miners, no block chain.

It might slow communication a bit, as there is the addition encryption/decryption step to accommodate, but modern ciphers tend to be quite fast, and the OP even admitted that "*Encryption don't slow the communication* ***notably***..."
And encryption doesn't have to increase the message size.  Most full disk encryption systems work at a block level, and can be applied to existing disk images, by essentially doing "read($BLOCK) -&gt; encrypt($KEY,$BLOCK) -&gt; write($BLOCK)".  The location of data blocks doesn't change, nor does the amount of space taken up.

This isn't the only comment like this, and I'm curious.  What are some of the "in-between" possibilities?
I'm also in the binary outcome camp -- in 25 years, I can't any other options than Bitcoin being essentially worthless (there might be a few people keeping it going as a hobby, but bitcoins, if you can buy them, would be worth fractions of a penny) or Bitcoin is as ubiquitous as cell phones, Apple or TCP/IP.  If the latter is the case, then minimum value would be tens or hundreds of thousands per BTC.
I can think of literally zero situations where the value of a 2040 Bitcoin is anywhere between $0.01 and $10,000.  (My personal bet is that it will be more than that range.  But I'm not selling my house on it.)

Electrum encrypts it's wallet file.  As long as you shred(1)ed the unencrypted seed file, you could post the image of the sd card on a public web server without worry.
As far as the Pi itself being compromised... I'm not entirely sure how a potential attack would work, as it is only used to sign transactions, and is not networked.  In order to leak private data, both the Pi and the networked computer would need to be compromised, and have a covert information channel using the USB stick.
If you're that paranoid, you might want to look into brainwallets, and sign your transactions with a pen, paper and maybe a pocket calculator.

Use one of the many tools available to generate key pairs on an offline PC, and write them to a file.  Split off the public keys to another file.  Encrypt the private keys with a tool like GnuPG and a *long* passphrase.
Then copy the encrypted keys and the public keys to a USB stick and move them onto a networked PC, and store them *everywhere*.  Dropbox, GMail, GDrive, work computers, home computers.  Put the files on SD cards in a safe.
When it comes time to take the fund out of cold storage, transport the file back to an offline PC, decrypt, and import the appropriate private key into a wallet app.

I bought a $200 video card a couple of years ago to mine with.  It managed around 250MH/s.
If you could freeze the difficulty at it's current level, that card would make 0.00013841BTC per day, or about $0.15.  So if you bought that card today, used, and the difficulty doesn't change, it would pay for itself in about 22 months.
But the difficulty isn't staying the same.  It will likely go up by 100 or 1000 times it's current level in the next 2 years.
A $100 video card might pay for itself, some day, but that is highly unlikely.  Go to localbitcoins.com and buy 0.1BTC from someone.  In 2 years, it might be worth $1000.  (Or $0.50.  Who knows....)

Look at gold as a counter-example.
* It is freely exchangable
* Is independent of monetary policy
* Fixed exchange rate
The last (fixed exchange rate) is harder to prove, but look at it's historical buying power.  In the 1800s, a you could buy a suit for an ounce of gold.  $1200 today will buy you a reasonable suit.  When the Shelby Cobra was introduced, it was $5000.  50 years later, $5000 in gold would be worth around $100,000.  Which would buy you a very nice muscle car.

Without the public keys moved into online wallets, funding the addresses will be difficult.
And if you just save the electrum seed or the wallet.dat file of your favourite client, you are running the risk that that information will be easy to work with in the long term.

Yeah letting other people have control of your coin is risky.  Having coins in a wallet on a computer you control is less risky, but you're still open to the possibility of getting hacked.  It's all about how much value you have vs how likely it is to be attacked.
I was fine with an Electrum installation on my home laptop and work workstation, both using the same wallet file so I could manipulate coins.  I run Linux and felt quite comfortable.  Then the exchange rate spiked and I realized I had close to $30k sitting on the internet.  :)  I set up a dedicated offline wallet running on a Raspberry Pi shortly after.

Quite aside from forgetting your wallet password, or having the exchange you happen to have your coins in at the moment get hacked, Bitcoin is a huge risk.  
Today's price is $1000, but where it will be in a year or five years is uncertain.  It is still vulnerable to attack from entities with large amounts of funds, and will be for some time.  Future value may be huge or negligible, so don't bet the farm.

Don't use coinbase as a wallet.  It's an exchange.  Keeping significant amounts of coin there will lead to pain.
If you must use an online wallet,  is well respected and appears to have done it's security well.  But a local wallet client is probably best.  Electrum and Multibit are good options.
If you end up with more than a couple of coins, *then* you can start looking into offline wallets and paper wallets.  But they're probably overkill for a beginner.

On the other hand, Armoury requires bitcoin-qt running underneath, and a full copy and of the block chain to work.  Probably more than a n00b wants to deal with.  
Electrum and MultiBit are "light" clients that interact (securely) with servers on the 'net to send and recieve transactions.
I would avoid web wallets if at all possible, as you need to trust them to have their security correct.  blockchain.info/wallet is supposed to be better than most, but I still wouldn't trust them with more than a coin or two.

You need to back up the wallet seed.
With that seed, you can recreate the wallet on another fresh Electrum install.  And the wallet file stored on the Pi is encrypted, so it wouldn't be of any use to an attacker if it was stolen.
Remember that your Bitcoins aren't stored in your wallet.  They are stored in the blockchain, on the network.  All your wallet stores are the keys to access them.

Coinbase lets you send and receive Bitcoin to your account, but you do not have control of the keys.  They are not your Bitcoins.  They are Coinbase's Bitcoins that they promise to give you.  With a proper wallet, coins are stored in addresses that only you have the keys for.  Blockchain.info/wallet is online, but they encrypt the private keys in your browser with Javascript, and claim that they never see unencrypted keys.  But they could be lying, or get hacked.
There have been many online wallet services (and exchanges) that have been hacked or turned out to be scams and the losses for their customers have been thousands or tens of thousands of Bitcoins.

Maybe export the private keys, edit the file so that *just* that one key pair is in the file, create a new, temp wallet, and import that key into it.  It should show up with 0.277512 BTC.  If so, transfer it to a different address in your primary wallet.
You've got an odd problem.  However, relax, in that it's what's in the blockchain that counts.  Your client may be confused, but the BTC is still available to you.  My guess is that the transaction yesterday was disappeared from the network somehow, and that confused the internal state of MultiBit.  You just need to unconfuse it.

So they would give you $100 in Bitcoin, and you would get less Bitcoin back.
This will continue to be the case until such time as the volitility of Bitcoin drops enough that it's a coin toss whether it will be worth more or less after a month.

I'd say it would hold up pretty well.  Hopefully I'll have made sufficient arrangements that other trusted people can reproduce the passphrase.
I guess it all depends what you're concerned about. A paper wallet is inherently less secure than an encrypted key pair or wallet seed.  That can be a plus or minus.

I've thought about getting into localbitcoins....  If I do, I'm not interested in anything other than cash, in person to sell coins. Too easy to get scammed.

Every 2016 blocks, the difficulty is modified^* such that the past 2016 blocks would have taken exactly 2 weeks to mine.  Up or down.
^* The adjustment is limited. Difficulty can't change by more than a factor of 4 in any adjustment.  ie:  No more than 400% or less than 25% of the current difficulty.  However, even with all the ASIC hardware being added, I don't think we've seen an increase above 50% yet.
@_date: 2013-11-30 22:04:10
Definitely. However I would suspect the odds of even a moderately secure passphrase being compromised is much lower than a single copy of the wallet (or an unencrypted physical copy of the seed) being lost, destroyed or stolen.

Not much arbitrage happens.
For the same reason that there are large differences in exchange rates -- converting Bitcoin to fiat and back can be hard.  As a Canadian, I'm fairly lucky in that I have access to a reasonably high quality exchange - cavirtex.com - that I can move fiat to or from in only 2-3 days.  But it's limited to Canadian citizens only.  When I last checked, the only way to fund most other exchanges for me is via bank transfers, which take days to weeks, if I can get an account at all.  Since I am isolated on Virtex, the exchange rate is isolated.
If exchanges allowed fiat balances to be freely exchanged, or made it faster and easier for international funding of fiat, this would be less of an issue.

Do you have multiple copies of your paper wallets? Paper is remarkably fragile.  And what security arrangements? I'd trust good encryption over a bank vault any day.
I'm puzzled by people using paper wallets for long term, secure storage .... I'm not really sure they're either.

I have yet to hear of someone winning the lottery every week for a year.
And SHA256 is the hash function that underlies the security of the blockchain.  The private/public keys that Bitcoin uses for transactions use ECDSA signatures, which I *think* I have heard as being much harder to break than the current common RSA/DSA key systems (which are not in Bitcoin anyway)...
@_date: 2013-12-04 04:54:31
Electrum is pretty lightweight compared to Armoury, which might be desirable in a cold storage wallet.  Both make offline signing easy.  If you use one or the other as your day-to-day wallet, go with what you know.

Heh.  Sorry.  :)  It's just that PayPal sends up huge bright red flags to anyone who has been around Bitcoin for any length of time.  It's such a high risk because all the buyer has to do is say the word "Bitcoin" and the transaction will be reversed.  Any time in the next 90 days.  Or more.
So, while you may be ok with the possibility of losing $100 (and if so, PP may be an acceptable risk) you might consider all the PayPal warnings being posted here to be directed to any newbies reading the thread who might think that PP is a good way to buy and sell Bitcoin.  For down that road lies many tears and frustration.

I just created a quick coinbase account.  I'm not sure you can, as they appear to hide all of the "confusing" bits from the user.  You don't appear to be able to see the individual addresses that your balance is associated with, for example.

I'm giving out 0.1BTC and 0.025BTC paper wallets, depending on who the friend is.  "See this card?  It's worth $25.  Next week it might be worth $30.  Let me know if you want help cashing it out."
The thought of making some real money is an excellent motivator to do some research.  :)  
The above might not work with non-techie people, though....

Encrypt your Electrum wallet seed, and distribute it widely.  I have copies of my offline wallet seed on 6 different computers in 4 different locations, plus copies in a GMail attachment and Google Drive.

I would have said the same thing two months ago, and it's gone up a good 5X since then... And 10X in the last 4 months.
$10K by February?  I really doubt.  $4-5K seems high, too, but I wouldn't place any bets.  And by next December?  Who really knows...  $10 is as good a bet as $50k.

Not sure it's *more* secure.  Certainly not less secure.

There are no coins "in" your wallet.
If it's not showing on Blockchain.info, it hasn't happened yet.
From what I can see, Multibit has submitted the transaction for inclusion in the blockchain, but it hasn't happened yet.  Wait a couple of hours, and it will probably show up in the Blockchain.  If it doesn't you'll still have the Bitcoins in 12ACqa.

Are you using the "Shared send" feature?  This uses Blockchain's anonymising service, but there is a 0.5% fee attached.

Worth considering:  With paper wallets, you run the risk of losing or destroying the wallet, or someone finding it and stealing the private key.
With encrypted copies of the private keys, your main risk is forgetting the passphrase, or getting hit by a bus and having your next of kin unable to access the keys because they can't decrypt the file.

Electrum will regenerate any address that you don't manually import.
@_date: 2013-12-06 06:57:02
Exactly. The "address"  that you see lets you search the blockchain for Bitcoins associated with it. The  private key, which you don't generally see (one private key per address) is what allows you to remove Bitcoins from the address and add them to another address.

Mining hardware is a sunk cost.  In the event of a significant price drop, hardware *sales* might drop off somewhat, but existing hardware is going to keep running.
If it is costing more in electrical costs to run a piece of hardware than it is making in BTC value, it *might* get shut down.  On the other hand, the $12 Bitcoin that cost $15 in electricity to mine is now worth $700-1000 or more today, so that's not guaranteed.
