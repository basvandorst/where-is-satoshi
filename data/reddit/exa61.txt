Still the same issue. Seems that I opened only inbound capacity channel with them so I can only receive through this channel.

Maybe our channels are not connected to each other... I opened a channel with Zap, lightning casino, and  lightningpowerusers

Maybe you disabled all notifications on your phone. If not, you should report it to them so they can fix it in the next update.

Yes, it then asks for another different one, and after that one, it continue to asks another one, and every file is .dll

Why so sad?
@_date: 2019-01-05 10:54:34
Yeah, sure. I have multiple copies of wallet and seed. I'm wondering why the current version which I was using for more than a year stucked with syncing without any reason. I was using 2.9.3v without any problems for more than a year and it stucked syncing last few days.
