Bitcoin Gold and Bitcoin Dark never set their sights on replacing BTC. The people in their camp were never calling for the end of the BTC camp, to replace it entirely with their own coin.
That’s why bcash has gotten such a bad rep with so many of us. Because from the get go their logos was ‘destroy and replace’, not ‘live alongside’

I'm honestly not certain it's a fee it seems so ridiculous. I'd love to see someone from indacoin say something like it's a one time 10$ payment or something

Hello! After 5 years I've finally come to realize that I'm just never going to be rich enough to be dropping 50$ a time on bitcoins. It's going to be a much slower investment for me, but with BTC now a full 3000$ more valuable when I first heard of them, I just can't afford not to have any anymore. 
One of my big fears has been security, so to counteract this I want to 'host' my coins in more then one way. Right now I'm looking for ways to store them physically, on a dedicated device or on my iPhone. I think having them on my computer is a bad idea, my current laptop is almost certainly compromised, and I'm not sure I'll be able to keep my new computer clean enough to trust it either. 
So right now I'm thinking opendime, breadbasket, and I also have a program on my phone called Jaxx that I don't see in this post at all. Is Jaxx any good? 
I guess I'm being kind of vague, so let me clarify I want to be able to buy small quantities often and store for long periods of time. Any advice you think I might find helpful, I'm happy to hear it - this is like my fourth or fifth time trying to 'break in' so to speak to get started on what's going to be a lifelong process of accumulating coins.... obviously I haven't had much luck yet since I'm still here asking haha so thanks for reading.

The people running BCash were on social media for days saying they would ‘plot the death of bitcoin core’ and that ‘bcash is the only real bitcoin and all other altcoins including bitcoin need to become worthless so people ONLY use bcash, the one true bitcoin.’
So, no, we could not all coexist happily ever after.

Oddly enough, hearing you say it like that, I feel like I’m doing *both* whenever I buy bitcoin.

35$ a week???
Buddy I play the lotto at a rate of 10$ a *month* and it still feels extravagant. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 09:49:04
I have roughly 35% of my income going into crypto in total, the 10$ lotto ticket is about 0.006% of my income, so while it is unnecessary, cutting it for more crypto isn't going to do much.

If you mean BTC replacing USD as standard currency across a significant enough portion of the economy as to have no need for USD anymore... well there’s a large portion of people that believe in Bitcoin but don’t expect to see that happen in their lifetime.

Remember when people said having more then one phone in a house was unrealistic? History is full of nay-sayers that we could point to. People thought the internet would flop. Hell, take a look at the history of money itself and the transition from gold to paper seems to be littered with opposition. 
Sure it’s a gamble, but you don’t have much to lose. If it pays, a 100$ buy in could triple or likely much much more. That’s beyond the fact the no government can directly control the currency, in fact no one can. Eventually the miners will reach a limit and there won’t be any more bitcoin to make. Then the big government bitcoin farms all have to turn off (or more likely start mining a different crypto)

To the best of my knowledge, that's how it was all done in the beginning. What I want to see from bitcoin next is a mass producible device that can securely handle everything you want from bitcoin. Basically a hot wallet running a VPN or something. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 09:55:49
I have fun in just buying the ticket and feeling like "what if I get rich right now??" for a little while. It is extravagant, especially because you simply don't play the lotto if you already have enough money to not worry about it. 
On the other hand though *someones* gotta win the lotto, right? It *might* be you, just a super tiny chance. But for that one guy who does win, how great must that be for him? But if no one were to play the lotto, that could never happen. So while the logical thing to do is to not play lotto, cause you likely won't win, there can be personal and societal reasons to play responsibly. I guess as an aside I also use that as incentive to not gamble, not like I've ever had a problem or anything but it just seems super fun and something I could have a problem with, so whenever I think about it or someone asks me to go I can just think "nah I've already gamble 10$ on lotto this month"

Bro, money assets have not been ‘tangible’ since 1945 when the US dollar was taken off the Gold Standard. Ever since then, numbers on paper are just as meaningless as numbers on a machine. 
Numbers on the machine not high enough? Just program it to be more. 
Not enough paper money to go around? Just print more!

Not a lot of people making that. and even if they are, its not *nothing*, it's literally a quantifiable amount. Not a lot, sure, but even the small bits add up.

But, yeah, buy during the dip

If I had a million dollars worth of bitcoin, you bet your ass I would keep like 100$ of it on a hot wallet for the chance to spend it. Future money is cool, I’d wanna use some of it!
Besides, all those 1000$ pizza spenders have that surreal feeling, which helps them know they’re not entirely dead inside.

My recommendation is to spend as much as you feasibly can, as soon as you feasibly can.

Only 5% of Americans own Bitcoin. So, highly flawed assumption here.

I think the way he handled his creation is praise worthy. It's pretty rare for something this big to come along, Satoshi's set a good example for people.

Uhhhh, did you not know about Satoshi? He IS this figure already. He's doing us all a huge favor by remaining anonymus, and the amount of effort that must be taking him, I feel, ought to earn him praise.

This is all part of the learning curve. If we don’t want a centralized authority to put an end to this shit, then we must learn to recognize it ourselves and starve it by not buying into it and spreading the word. 
We have to accept that this is ok, this is part of life, and there are those who are unable to look into what exactly they are purchasing. They will fall for this, and we must demand that they learn or be left behind. 
The only other option is a body of authority designed to regulate this thing, and that’s exactly what bitcoin was made to avoid.

So, I'm really interested in living off the grid, and I'd never really considered mining bitcoin off solar power, so first off I wanna say wow that seems awfully innovative, especially nowadays that solar is getting so cheap. Harvest the sun into magic internet money!
Also I think you're clearly very right about some of these people just not wanting their personal little secret to get out, just based on reactions. 
Anyways I wanna ask you, what would be your opinion on just buying a miner and using the same one? I understand it'll go out of date over time, but I don't wanna deal with the hassle of buying and selling miners constantly while also living off the grid. So do you think you'd even bother with this if you weren't getting new miners all the time? Or do you suppose simply selling back the electricity would be a better option in that case?
I'm still very much a noob around here so thanks for the info muh dude

We don’t have to aim for egalitarian communism to understand the rich have power over the poor and that they weaponize peacekeeping mechanisms to maintain their power.

It's more like, you're the only one here who seems to see it as about communism. Or more precisely, you were the first to put it into a communist context. I'm coming from a capitalist context - I've lived in a capitalist America my whole life, I'm well aware that socialism has ruined economies that put it in place, for example Venezuela, and with regards to communism - it's like it was never really enacted and everywhere that supposedly has it is basically fascism controlling a capitalist economy and calling itself communism! So let me be clear that I'm not in favor of equality at all, really, I've always felt like life isn't fair and that's how it is suck it up. 
But the rich fight the poor. It's not about socialist methodology; socialists may utilize this fact in their arguments. I just think you're getting wrapped up in 'the good fight' or whatever against socialism to see it, like let me respond your 3 implications of the statement. The rich *are* more powerful then the poor. I doubt you'd disagree then that but I could explain why if you want. The enmity and hatred thing is misunderstood, it's about scarcity. In a capitalist society like ours there's scarcity, it's like the very root of supply and demand, the rich don't hate the poor they understand the issue of scarcity and they feel like their wealth may be tentative so they take measures to protect against it. 
Like, for example, a private prison owner forcing his inmates to work for less then .50$ an hour. He's getting paid to cage humans up, and paid again for the fruits of their labor. To me that is violence, not directly like a fist in the face but like how Russia told us the cold war was over then 'fought' us for years until we were stupid enough to elect a guy like Trump. 
Also, sorry I went on a tangent there but to come back to your edit: if everyone is claiming a thing is *not* about communism, it's probably about communism, right? Because there's no way it could actually have nothing to do with communism, and everyone is just stating that, to the only person saying it's all about communism. Just, a perspective. 
@_date: 2018-12-17 04:53:46
ok. you're right about everything. 
@_date: 2018-12-17 00:20:25


Isn't it though? If one person has money, and someone else gets that money, the person who had it has less. Unless you assume an infinite money supply, which as a person who seems to be against communism/socialism I would assume you'd understand why an infinite money supply is stupid... Is it not the case when new money is printed it lowers the spending power of the money already in circulation? why would this be unless there was a zero sum game going on? 


Force labor, is forced labor, end of story. It's intellectually dishonest to portray private prisons as charitable organizations who put inmates to work for their own good. 


The creator of *what?* because what we were talking about being about communism was a fucking *statement*: "the rich fight the poor" and idk who the fuck you think is the *creator* of that statement, so tbh I'm done arguing with you because this has made barely any sense. I feel like I'm trying to argue on the side of common sense against I don't even know what your position is, honestly. 
@_date: 2018-12-14 00:12:43


Yeah, no it's not, I never said or implied that and I don't believe it. 


never implies it's the only kind of power - it's just a pretty basic fact of life that's always been around. I mean, you're right about the whole bit about government power meant to curtail the power of the rich being easily corruptible by the rich and otherwise powerful. But that's not gonna change the fact that the rich have power over the poor. 
What's interesting to me is how this discussion started by someone essentially just saying "the rich fight the poor" and your kneejerk reaction goes right to egalitarian communism not having cops like dude, no one but you has said anything about promoting communism or anything like that.
