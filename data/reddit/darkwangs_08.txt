When companies invest in new technology they generally don't believe they'll get their money back in 2 months. 
You're really scraping the bottom of your anti-crypto barrel these days.

So you're saying that MtGox are not internally manipulating prices on their own exchange?

Their time would be better spent keeping an eye on alts. I made 60% buying and selling Maxcoin with Btc yesterday...had I been to the party on time it would have been 300%.

How do you feel now, still think I'm lying? HTF can you even begin to defend that fat useless con-man kunt Karpeles?

I got lucky with Maxcoin....noticed that it'd had shot up by over 200% with high volume yesterday, bought and put a sell order in 60% higher which luckily went through.
It's true, I've lost on trades too. Made a BUNCH on Dogecoin, though. That's the next big one. Bitcoin is still my rock, though.

Sorry, much idiotic post by dcwsco.

I disagree with this post. Bad news about Bitcoin always gets posted on r/bitcoin. OP is stating as fact that only good news gets touted here.
Darkwings using reasonable language under a different name is still Darkwings doing his best to make Bitcoin fail.

dcwsco, FUCK your downvote. Why would you do that to what is a very thoughtful and reasonable post? 
Everyone with half a brain knows that MtGox owners are using their positions at the exchange to internally drive the price lower. Right now the other exchanges are trading 300% higher than Gox. There is no other explanation for this except that the Gox price is FALSE. I doubt very much that Gox customers are panic selling. Why sell at far below market? Just wait for withdrawals to resume and watch the price rocket. And it WILL rocket in mere minutes after withdrawals resume (if they ever do).

"the MtGox haters will be happily trading with them again." No way. There are too many better exchanges. People will leave them in droves. 
I'm taking what little Btc I have left with them away from MtGox. My crypto coins are spread amongst 7 other exchanges as well as multiple personal wallets.

Buying time is all. When that protestor asked Karpeles if everyone's bitcoins were safe Karpeles refused to answer. Fat POS. All he had to do is say "Don't worry, sir, your and everyone else's coins are safe."

You pathetic, sad moron. You lost all credibility with that ridiculous $100/$102US statement. Those were anomalies/errors inputted by customers. I read the thread where you defended your $200 or less "prediction" based on those false values and chose not to bring it up on this thread thinking that no-one would be that stupid twice. 
What a sad syphilitic sperm bubble you are.

And when Gox starts allowing withdrawals Bitcoin will beat all records. How do you feel about that, son?
@_date: 2014-02-14 16:53:52
Nothing that moron says makes one bit of difference to the price. If China and Russia combined can't end Bitcoin then I doubt one lonely, friendless idiot can.

Criminal behavior, no doubt about it. This started when they started stalling on fiat withdrawals. Over time their price per Bitcoin moved well ahead of the other exchanges in an attempt to get people to move their Btc to MtGox. Now that they need to get hold of more Bitcoin to pay their customers their price is a whopping $125US LOWER than the other exchanges. This stops customers with Btc from cashing out. It's blatant crookedness.
I actually think they're trying to DESTROY Bitcoin and thus get out of their responsibilities to their clients. 
Karpeles and Co. are fucking kunts.
@_date: 2014-02-21 02:57:35
All will be well when Gox goes away. Karpeles doesn't care, he'll be trying to disappear sooner than later. 
Do you actually believe the volume being reported by Gox as genuine? I don't, I think it has been internally manipulated. There is simply no way that people holding Btc on Gox are selling them at those ridiculous prices.
I'll give you credit...your predictions are looking pretty good for now.
I predict that Bitcoin will come out of this stronger than ever.
