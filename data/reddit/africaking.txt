I wouldn't call it a feature but options...I like bitcoinica for the leverage but I have yet to find a place to trade options.
@_date: 2013-12-01 20:30:28
Okay everyone. I sold. The price can start going back up now.
@_date: 2013-02-19 21:30:47
So they can't be sued for anti-competitive business practices.
@_date: 2013-03-05 17:23:04
Good for you. Not all returns are money.

Thanks. Haven't used this site before.

Can you update when you clear the backlog of donations?
@_date: 2013-11-29 19:24:53
I like your art but too expensive for me.

What is the cheapest way to get money out of Mt Gox without using dwolla?
@_date: 2013-03-01 01:34:08
Trading fees are also much much better compared to other assets
@_date: 2013-04-01 21:28:13
Doesn't satoshi circle do the same thing?
@_date: 2013-02-14 20:50:39
So I heard someone was buying gold?
@_date: 2013-12-23 03:16:00
Where is Ja!?
@_date: 2013-02-12 03:17:16
100 coins? nice
@_date: 2013-03-27 02:30:43
I use bitcoinity now but I would like to see market depth too
@_date: 2013-03-05 09:39:06
No one ever went broke taking profits...Liquidated my holdings
@_date: 2013-03-31 13:31:52


It does
@_date: 2013-02-21 20:00:09
Sounds like work
@_date: 2013-03-27 02:28:43
Is it just me or other people can't access mtgoxlive?
@_date: 2013-03-05 17:22:17
Conversely, you are not going to be happy if it drops off. Point is, I don't know the future holds and for me to reinvest, I'll need to reevaluate the risk.
@_date: 2013-03-27 02:38:37
Thanks, don't know how I missed that
@_date: 2013-03-05 08:14:41
Why don't you buy on gox and sell on those markets?
@_date: 2013-02-21 19:23:10
A secure bitcoinica?
@_date: 2013-03-06 03:52:05
If I had the funds, I would gladly try out the [Greater Fool theory](
@_date: 2013-03-05 17:19:46
Because it was an investment and I wanted to take my profits. I'll need to reevaluate the stability of this price before I reinvest. In the mean time, I'll just use it as a transactional currency.
