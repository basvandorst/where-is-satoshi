I'm not sure about fungibility, but they definitely destroyed immutability of ETH as evidence of ETC.

Immutability of the blockchain or bust.  The point was to remove human control and trust reliance from the equation altogether.

This the most likely scenario. The majority of early adopters back Core and will be dumping BU coins immediately after the fork. It is this market price discovery that defines the real Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-11-29 21:47:00
I'd argue the exact opposite. The difference is due to my belief that Bitcoin is apolitical digital gold and your [implied] belief that it's a low cost payment network.

I think life in the US is great, but I don't have to agree with US monetary policy or US foreign policy.
I'm a Bitcoin enthusiast who accepts the idea that a deflationary currency helps people save and retire, instead of spend and work their lives away, and as consequence slows GDP growth even in real terms, not just nominal terms.
Thus, I like to argue against central planning and central bankers.

Good thing the Federal Reserve rigged the price of money at 0% for 10 years, bailed out banks and foreign governments with trillions of dollars, or we'd be in big trouble! /s
Under the Federal Reserve, there is no way we'll ever see another Great Depression. All hail the all-knowing central planner Janet Yellen. Ignore the secret wealth concentration! Trust us! /s


Very clever. I need to think more about your sarcastic response when I post. Thanks for the tip!

Thanks to advancements in manufacturing and increases in technology. This has nothing to do with the supply of money.


This makes literally no sense. You work for dollars and currency allows price comparisons to be made. No one earns the same wage per hour. Comparing hours of labor is total nonsense.
@_date: 2016-12-22 16:19:24
For it to become a widespread currency, it has to appreciate in value relative to other currencies. Thus, the price has to go up. There is no way around that. I also don't see how this is a problem.
@_date: 2016-12-21 16:14:56
Is it safe to say you do not own any Bitcoin then?
I accept the slight decrease in GDP growth (measured in real terms) of a deflationary currency. However...
Returns from investment in business and technology will always outpace that of holding deflationary currency.
The difference is that unsophisticated poor working-class people get to save money, instead of being forced to spend every dime they have. They may even have a chance to retire and enjoy life. The rest of us will invest as usual.
Prices going down, including the price of labor, does not mean we are necessary getting poorer; we might be getting richer.
As everyone tries to argue here, the price of labor relative to goods is only what matters, dollars are just a unit of account to make the comparison.
@_date: 2016-12-21 17:36:34
Please... Bitcoin's price didn't increase because of its inherent deflationary pressure. Only a fool would believe that. This kills the rest of your entire argument.
Also, I was referring to large portion of the US population, since the US was the subject we were on, but now that it has changed to the entire world, the whole dynamic is different.
You want to assume everyone starts each working day with absolute zero dollars. Congratulations, you're a good socialist!
I made the false assumption that people posting regularly in r/bitcoin actually believed in the economics of Bitcoin, but clearly that's false. Shame on me...

I suppose this might not line up with the exact definition of the word compromise - if it implies some kind of unanimous agreement - but Core definitely had some of big block supporters interests in mind releasing Segwit as it is.

Segwit increases the block size. That's the compromise and yes, with big block supporters. Segwit could have been released without a block size increase.

I appreciate the sarcasm.
I was just making the point that it's incorrect to blame the free market as the cause of something when a free market didn't exist then or now, yet the market still crashed in '87, '01, '08, and the bubble looks ready to burst any time now.
We're on team Bitcoin. Stop apologizing on behalf of central bankers...

Remember folks, without inflation, the economy will grind to a halt. How dare people even think of saving money, deferring purchases, or retiring?! This is unacceptable! We need to keep them broke and working! /s
@_date: 2016-12-15 14:36:50
I hope Ver comes around. As someone who is politically like-minded, he should be prioritizing decentralization and fungibility and trying not to exercise control or promote mining cartel control. If Bitcoin becomes centralized with mining cartels acting as the Federal Reserve board of directions, we all lose. He should know this.
Socialism is the most prevalent political view and implies centralization and control of money by the State. There will be many others who will want to take Bitcoin in this direction.
@_date: 2016-11-29 22:16:05
How is "a simple block size increase" a long-term solution? IMO core developers are the only ones focused on long-term solutions - ie Elements, Lightning.
2mb blocks will be full almost instantly, then what? 1GB blocks? Now you have a worthless centralized payment network that's still better served from a sql database.
@_date: 2016-12-21 16:23:51
The price of labour is in dollars. The price of labour (in dollars) goes up as it tries to keep pace with an inflationary currency. The price of labour goes down with a deflationary currency. No one is more or less poor.
The difference is that unsophisticated working-class people have the ability so save their money and possibly retire some day, while the rest of us invest in business and technology as usual, where returns will outpace that of deflation.

I don't believe merely holding a stable slightly deflationary currency would ever outperform stocks/bonds in the long-run.
There may be cyclical periods of uncertainty where more investors move to this theoretical deflationary currency and out of stocks/bonds, but so what? That's healthy.
What's unhealthy is artificially inflating a huge asset bubble via central planning and then blaming natural cycles for the extreme crash, which wouldn't have been as extreme without the centrally planned asset bubble.
The idea that in order to achieve constant growth, a private central bank has to inflate away people's savings to encourage them to spend everything they have, borrow, and live off debt is complete nonsense.
The greatest concentration of wealth in history had and is still occurring as a result of 100 years of these central bank apologist, inflationary arguments.

My favorite statistic from this website is BTC dominance against all altcoins which is at 87.5% up from 80% earlier this year mainly as a result of ETH losing more than 50% of its peak value.
@_date: 2016-12-20 22:19:58
Do you realize this is comparing purchasing power? The purchasing power of the dollar has declined by 97% since the creation of the Federal Reserve System through inflation compared to gold, history's universal money...
Wages have also gone up over time in dollars, also showing the erosion of its purchasing power...
@_date: 2016-12-21 16:02:34
Right, and labor is increasing in dollars/hr which shows the erosion in purchasing power of the dollar as a unit of account. This is at the detriment of savers or working-class people looking to retire. Of course the value of labor will try to keep up with inflation, but it usually lags as people have to renegotiate for a higher wage and that's not easy.
Yes, less sophisticated people will hold cash and aren't forced to spend it (they weren't investing it anyway), while everyone else still invests in business and technology because those returns will always outpace that of holding cash.
Prices going down does not mean we are getting poorer. We are actually getting richer. As you said, the dollar is just a unit of account in all of this.
@_date: 2016-09-25 15:57:55
They are all intertwined. Holding indirectly supports development of the technology simply by placing value to it. Holding directly supports adoption because it is adoption by definition. Also, because you hold, others who trust your opinion are more likely to want to hold as well.

Dump the private key of your public address in Bitcoin Core.  Help menu =&gt; Debug window =&gt; Console (tab)
    dumpprivkey 1JWwQZvfJp5DYsJrxhj1eAug7jhbG2xMfB
Save this private key. Download Bitcoin Core 0.13.0.  Open with a fresh wallet (by renaming wallet.dat).
Help menu =&gt; Debug window =&gt; Console (tab)
    importprivkey the_private_key_you_saved
Bitcoin Core will rescan the Blockchain searching for transactions associated with that address.  I believe it will not find the outgoing zero fee stuck transaction.
If this doesn't work, try restarting Bitcoin Core with the following zapwallettxes option (Linux):
    ./bitcoin-qt -zapwallettxes=1
On Windows refer to:
You should be able to send again (with a higher fee).
@_date: 2016-09-25 15:34:09
With Bitcoin Core, you are an equal participant in a massive peer-to-peer network that synchronizes all Bitcoin transactions that have ever occurred (the Blockchain) in order to not have to rely on a centralized database controlled by a centralized third party.
If you want to trust a third party, consider using a different software wallet like Electrum Bitcoin wallet.
To export your private key from Bitcoin Core. Help menu =&gt; Debug window =&gt; Console (tab)
    dumpprivkey your_public_receiving_address
Don't share the private key with anyone or they can steal your balance. Import/sweep this into another software wallet.
@_date: 2016-09-12 15:12:44
It's also up 60,500% from when it once was $1.  What is your point?
@_date: 2016-09-25 15:23:19
Bitcoin Core doesn't see your balance because it discovers your balance by checking the Blockchain, which it is currently downloading to your computer and is 5 years 17 weeks behind on the data. One it completes, you will see your balance. You did not lose anything.
If you decide to run Bitcoin Core, you have to download the entire Blockchain to your computer which is ~96GB.  This is nice because you are in 100% control of your coins and do not have to check with a third party to find your balance (maximum privacy).
If you don't want to use Bitcoin Core, you will have to export your private key for your public receiving address and import/sweep this into another Bitcoin software wallet like Electrum.

The price reaching $50,000 would put the total market cap around $1 trillion, which is totally reasonable.
There exists tens of trillions of dollars worth of fiat money in the world.  The Federal Reserve printed ~$3 trillion out of thin air after the 2009 crash.
The ECB and Bank of Japan are currently printing $180 billion per month. That's $2.16 trillion per year.  Wait until the Fed starts printing again...
For Bitcoin to compete with fiat globally, it would have to be valued at more than $50,000 per coin.  Fiat currencies are printed more than that each year (on average since 2009).

You assume I'm butt hurt, but how can that be when there is a huge grin on my face?

This will help: 
If you are in no hurry, you could send with 0.00020 BTC/KB and it might confirm in 12 hours.
If you are in a hurry, consider using the recommended fee of 0.0006 BTC/KB for 10 minute confirmation.
Make sure your total transaction fee is at least 0.0001 as a rule of thumb.

Such nonsense. Fungibility is more important than short-sighted scalability. Full blocks are working fine due to fees. Fees reduce spam which is good. Bitcoin has not died. Core's path is excellent. Have you watched the Scaling Milan talks? This is a very exciting and positive time for Bitcoin!
The "big blocks, bloated blockchain, but no fungibility or lightning network" camp will be what is quickly abandoned in the event of a hard fork.

I just learned on Tails' website that Electrum Bitcoin wallet is included by default, so I'd recommend using that instead.  One 13 word seed gives you a wallet with multiple bitcoin addresses.  You can encrypt the seed or the wallet files using AES256 with PGP if you want an extra layer of encryption.

1) Download &amp; burn Tails Linux (.iso) to a DVD
2) On bitaddress.org, click on the link (zip) on the bottom of the page or click [here](
3) Extract this zip and copy the folder to a USB flash drive
4) Boot the Tails Linux DVD on a secure offline machine (disconnect hard drive for good measure)
5) Connect the flash drive and open the bitaddress folder, you'll find bitaddress.org.html, right-click and open with Tor Browser* or whatever web browser comes with Tails
*Javascript is required to run so if you have problems I'd start by making sure Javascript is enabled on Tor Browser

It is included with the latest Tails, so there is no need to connect the machine to the Internet.
Tails is a Debian-based Linux variant, so Electrum can be also installed by entering two commands in a Terminal, taken from [electrum.org/download](
    sudo apt-get install python-qt4 python-pip
    sudo pip install 
Electrum is reliable for generating HD wallets because it follows a specific protocol.  The resulting wallet seed, keys, and associated addresses are very secure and reliable if generated on a secure machine.
Once this protocol is implemented in Bitcoin Core, I'll switch to that for HD wallet generation.

I recently wrote a how-to guide to create a hierarchical deterministic paper wallet, which is basically the 13 word mnemonic seed from an Electrum Bitcoin wallet written down on a piece of paper.
This is the preferred method for creating paper wallets today.  Saving an ECDSA Public/Private key pair is discouraged as each "wallet" should only be used for one transaction and the entire balance must be sent out or some of the balance could be lost in a change address.
