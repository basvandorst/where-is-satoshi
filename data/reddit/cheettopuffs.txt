Thanks for the suggestions; I took a look at their twitters and like the transparency and how active they are. Will be ramping up our twitter game real soon!

Thank you so much, means a lot. It's been a hell of a ride thus far.

It can be used for everything though! Including homework.  
@_date: 2014-08-06 05:56:13
That's do to the nature of the questions right now. You can post any question problems that you may have on there. :)

I will appreciate some feedback. Also, I am planning on doing overstock next followed by Systemax, Tigerdirect's parent company.

Hi! We are working on creating a rating system so users can gauge whether or not it would be worthwhile to spend time answering a question. 
Thanks for the comment! :)

 I'm also doing a dogecoin giveaway-- view my recent posts in case you're interested in that!

I like where you're going with this. Please elaborate.

This would definitely get some serious press. It would benefit both coins tremendously. Or better yet, sponsor two UFC fighters and have them fight each other. 
@_date: 2014-09-17 21:12:32
and I have been working on this for the past month. We are working on improving the UI at the moment. Any tips for us? 
@_date: 2014-08-06 05:16:24
The website itself does not have an automatic tipping platform at the moment. 
In regards to my giveaway- you must answer a questions and post an answer to another. 
@_date: 2014-08-06 06:21:27
This is an example of what it is INTENDED to be used for. I answered this tough calculus question- now it's my own question but the idea would be for another member to answer it and get tip for their service. 
Thanks for checking out my website btw. 
Cheers!

Trust fund baby or not, he is still smart enough to hold his own with the world's best poker players. Not only that, he still manages to win. But yeah, he definitely had it easier, no doubt about that. 
@_date: 2014-06-22 00:01:59
Okay, maybe I over hyped him. Winning millions does not mean he is one of the best, far from it. He probably cherry picks his opponents. I remember reading that he got like 180th place in the world poker series or something like that. Guess I shouldn't glorify the kid. He seems like a douche, but people like douche bags. Go figure.

Hi everyone!
We have decided to host a challenge on our website, [BitAnswers](
This challenge will take place over the next 14 days.
Our users currently get rewarded on our site by accumulating points for their participation on our website.  Users get points for posting questions, posting answers, and receiving upvotes.  The points are one measure of the ways our users enrich the BitAnswers community.  We want to challenge our users to see how else they can help the community.  Whether that means posting questions and offering bounties or answering other users questions, we want to see everyone form a unique community where everyone helps each other out.
So in the spirit of giving and this holiday season, we challenge our users to help each other out.
We will measure users' contributions through the accumulation of "points" in the next 14 days: Users who accumulate 2,000 additional points within the next 14 days will receive $10 each (up to 10 users).  Users who accumulate between 1,000-1,999 additional points will receive $5 each (up to 20 users).  Users who accumulate between 500-999 additional points will receive $1 each (up to 100 users).
Make sure the points are obtained in accordance with [BitAnswers's Community Guidelines]( We are working on implementing a ranking system and every question, up-vote, and down-vote, will contribute to your credibility and reputation as a user.  **Also, new users are more than welcome to participate in this challenge.**
Again, thank you and happy holidays!

That's an interesting concept. Are you a developer?? You have great ideas and this is still in it's infancy stages. Let me know if you would like to help out. I'm sure we can find something for you to do.
