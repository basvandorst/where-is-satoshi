IMO the question isn't about the price of each Bitcoin, however of Market Cap.  Currently, the market cap of Bitcoin stands at around $9bn.  I see that as a low estimate for a currency, especially one with international appeal.  As Warren Buffet says: don't worry about the "when" but the "what".  If you know what will happen, the when doesn't matter.  Enjoy the low Bitcoin price while it's here, because these prices won't last forever.

I agree.
Furthermore, George Soros is a one trick pony.  He was at the right place at the right time to go short the British Pound, and bagged himself a few $billion.
Just because Soros was right about one short doesn't make him an expert on the economy.
Buffet on the other hand, believes in Value Investing(tm).  Where they look at the fundamentals of a company before investing.   If the fundamentals say the company is worth X, but it's currently trading for less than that, then he buy that company.
Buffet is no angel investor or venture capitalist.   Because that's what's needed right now in the cryptocurrency space, not value investors.
Buffet &amp; Soros are not good examples for judging if crypto are a good investment or not, and their advice should be taken with a pinch of salt.

CeX has a really good rep in the UK, especially with the younger generation - this is good for Bitcoin.

Have you tried advertising your site? AdSense can bring new customers in.
You've also reached out to in an honest manner, which I believe  will be good for building trust.
I think you should get your site translated to a few other languages for the EU region. English should definitely be on top of the list, as many neighbouring EU countries may also be interested in buying from you.
You should also really consider a translation to Greek (for Greece). Greece is in the EU, they use Euros yet they do not have an exchange for Bitcoin yet, or a reliable means to buy them.
Most importantly: grab the attention of by being the first company to offer Bitcoin for sale in 'bits'.  A lot of people are excited about the switchover, I believe this is a good opportunity for your business to market itself to Bitcoin enthusiasts.

I installed bitcoin-qt in 2010, although I had first read about it in 2009 on Slashdot.  I launched QT for the first time and it displayed a balance of "0 BTC". I remember feeling annoyed they hadn't bundled a few free coins for me to test the system out with. 
I then stumbled on mtgox, looked at the prices and wanted to buy some. Unfortunately, I was day trading shares at that time and all my money tied up.
I forgot all about QT installed on my computer. When the price bust $1,000 I launched QT again - in case I had some coins, and I had forgotten about them. All I saw was that big fat "0 BTC" again.

When the internet was first making inroads in the uk, an internet cafe (not far from this store) had established itself. (Just off Goodge St). That internet cafe is no longer there, but this area in the west end is known for picking up trends early... Mainly because its located near Soho. So, my money is on 2017 being the year of The Big Bitcoin Bubble.

Michael O'Leary would be huge for Bitcoin. He is the Chairman of Ryan Air (a notoriously cheap airliner)  - customers are always complaining about their cc fees with Ryan Air, and both he and his airliner are constantly in the national news in the UK.

When I read bankers wanting to use blockchain tech, what I really hear them saying is "we're launching an altcoin".  You can't use blockchain without a unit of measure.  Bitcoin happens to call it's units of measure  "coins".
Banks no doubt want to create an altcoin which competes with bitcoin on some level (first internally amongst banks, then internationally).  However, as long as bitcoin keeps it's lead, not many vendors or startups are likely to form businesses around their altcoin.
Banks are some of the main reasons why bitcoin was invented.  To revert to a "BANKcoin" would indeed be an atrocity.

* irs taxation
* there's more places to sell than buy
* Bitcoin no longer cost a few dollars
* + loads of other important happenings since 2011.

I can see a few benefits. Sometimes when you purchase proprietary software, after a certain amount of time the licencing server stops working because the company abandoned that product. Also, it could save the company time making the software, instead of them writing their own licencing back-end and setting up server hardware, they can use smart contracts instead. Win win.
I personally prefer **no** DRM on software, but these types of software do exist.

If Satoshi was willing to mine 1m BTC and hasn't moved them my guess would be he bought loads more from other sources.  He probably was one of the first people to trade cash for BTC because no one was taking Bitcoin seriously at the time.  As he was the creator, the responsiblity of kickstarting bitcoin as a currency fell on his shoulders.  He probably bought another 1m (or more) BTC from other sources and is living happily off those.

Decentralised fiat exchanges aren't possible.

Bitcoin isn't about money for me.  It's about putting the power of control back in the hands of the masses.
Remember Occupy Wall Street? The protestors who got harassed and treated like garbage for going against the financial elites?
Those protestors were almost powerless, resorting to broadcasting vocal messages to passing strangers and sleeping rough to get their voices heard -  Degenerating to almost tramp/beggar like feeble status to accomplish that.
Bitcoin is a tool which gives people real control and power for change,  without resorting to beggar like status, shouting, screaming or sleeping rough.
Bitcoin is like s bank in your pocket, but with a barracks stationed outside, guarding your nuclear weapons silo aimed straight at governments and financial institutions.
But in no means is Bitcoin a violent  movement - it uses science, math, democracy and reasoning instead of bombs. But in time, Bitcoin may prove to be as effective as the most  destructive weapons.  Also proving peaceful and dignified measures can overcome injustice.
During Occupy Wall Street the people had no power, and Bitcoin now gives that power.
@_date: 2014-10-26 19:41:32

In my opinion most exchanges aren't using the already tested working code offered by the Bitcoin wallet. Most exchanges  (I've used) ignore existing api functionality offered by wallets and instead write their own internal  accounting code.
The Bitcoin wallet is more than just a wallet, but it's also a thoroughly tested p2p piece of accounting software. You know if an exchange is bypassing the wallet security by what happens to your funds after you withdraw some coins. If you don't see unconfirmed change coming back in to your exchange wallet, you can pretty much guess they're skipping the security offered by the bitcoin api, and instead using some internal accounting ledger.
If mtgox's claim about coins being stolen are true, they could have avoided it by using the api directly. The only exchange which seems to be handling it correctly is nintencoin ex, from what I've seen in the account txid history

Problem with OB is Bitcoin. The prices are swinging so wildly that repricing products (in order to avoid taking a financial loss) makes it tedious. I would like to see a floating BTC price on products based off price movements on exchanges.
Let's not forget: as a seller you have to wait for your parcel to make it's way to the buyer before coins are released. (Who knows what the price will be by the time the coins are released).  Too much risk imho involved right now and I would like this problem addressed.
Maybe some form of bitpay integration to convert automatically to fiat?! Not every merchant on OB probably wants to stay anonymous. For the folks that do, they can use Bitcoin. - just my 0.02btc

I must admit, when I first heard of Localbitcoins I thought the concept was so primitive for buying/selling Bitcoin, compared to exchanges.  Over time however, I have come to use them more and more.

Part of the allure of Bitcoin for a lot of people is not knowing S.N. real identity.  Maybe we will find out one day, but who knows with this guy.  
He hasn't even moved a single coin from his estimated (~1m BTC) mined stash.  He is a very unique individual, I'll give him that.   Not many people would be able to resist spending their hard earn cash, unless he's already well off.   But if he was already wealthy, why even bother creating Internet money, he could have earned it a lot of different places.    Maybe he bought a lot of Bitcoin in the early days, to cover he's tracks even more.   Because everyone knows about the first 1m BTC, he probably bought a ton more through alternate means and is living off those.

ETF is basically a centralised Bitcoin fund which sells shares. - Not giving actual Bitcoin!
If billions of dollars worth of ETF shares are purchased, that gives said fund a lot of centralised power over future Bitcoin developments.
Imagine if an ETF took off and was really successful, then the Bitcoin developers wanted to do a hard-fork for some reason.  If the ETF fund managers were against the hard-fork (say the hard-fork improved Bitcoin's anonymity), this could leave us with two copies of Bitcoin.   It's like Bitcoin vs Bcash but even worse!
These centralised ETF funds are in general bad for future developments of Bitcoin.  And I'm hoping they don't get approved any time soon.
@_date: 2018-11-12 03:53:35
I remember $600 bitcoin lasting some time, before it tanked even further and a lot of people got burned buying at such high prices.  Remember:  if you buy at $600 and invest thousands of dollars and it tanks to $300, (even though Bitcoin was cheaper) you've still lost half your money (on paper value at least).  You had no way of knowing Bitcoin was going to be worth a lot more then.  Most people wouldn't believe $20k Bitcoin, even for if they said it for fun sometimes.
There was a lot of hysteria then too, like now and people speculating on when the price would go higher.... But it kept falling lower and lower.
But then the community was smaller and new companies accepting Bitcoin (like Microsoft, Valve, Expedia) were all interesting events.
Lots of documentaries were appearing about Bitcoin, and I kept watching them.   Mining was still interesting and new coins were making an appearance like Ethereum.
I remember when Ethereum posted on r/Bitcoin announcing their ICO (and it reached the top page!)... I was like "pffft, this is like a scam" and never invested.
If you compare the two events, there's a lot more wide-spread adoption now, and a lot more people know about it.
I would say we're in for a bull run but it'll happen when no one expects it, because bear markets have a tendency to last a lot longer than anyone anticipates.
Talking about $100k, or even $1m Bitcoin sounds ridiculous now, just like talking about $20k Bitcoin was ridiculous then.   But my advice would be to keep the faith and the price will follow eventually.

In the short term you may lose on your investment, but in the long term I believe Bitcoin is golden.
Research Bitcoin/crypto in general before putting your money in.  Because once you do the research you'll realise that Bitcoin is more than just a dollar value number.  Bitcoin and crypto are new paradigms, we're entering a new world order, without central banking cartels and banksters.  Or, at-least a world where their influence is reduced.

This has been discussed many times before.  I don't know if the price would rocket or plummet if we started showing prices per satoshi tbh.
I'm in favour of the idea, but the great thing about Bitcoin/decentralised systems are that not one entity controls the format.   A lot show prices in BTC, others mbtc and so on.
Once the price reaches a certain threshold (I'm thinking $500k/BTC) then it might make sense to start showing the prices in Satoshis to newcomers.

Throughout bitcoin's history, there have been many instances when mining wasn't profitable.  The network still chugged along.   People mine for bitcoin for many reasons.   Some believe the value will go up in the future, some do it to keep the network secure, and some do it for fun.

I think we would see an incredible increase in competition with of miners if market cap did reach $20 trillion.
The number of miners would dramatically increase.

$20 trillion is about right for an international currency, so $1m per Bitcoin is feasible.

What blockchains exist without a token/coin?  I'll tell you: NONE!
Each block in a blockchain contains a list of transactions (tokens being moved around).
Now, the real question is: is calling a "digital asset" a "token" or a "coin" a valid name?  Probably not!  But that's the best we have so a blockchain without the "coin" part is pure nonsense!
Satoshi should have really called Bitcoin "BitDigitalAsset" but unfortunately for us, he didn't.

I doubt it.  There's a lot of trading going on (a lot).  Over $7bn worth of Bitcoin traded just in the last 24h according to: 
Traders are watching each other, watching other exchanges, watching the markets in general.  When there is price action on one exchange, traders know about it quite quickly and start buying/selling accordingly.
Back in the day, (2013 or so).  The spread was even wider than it is today on exchanges.  I remember btc-e.com having the biggest spread.
As the market matures, maybe hypertrading might become a thing in crypto.  Where bots buy/sell very fast and large volumes on exchanges to equalize the price and get the spreads down even further.
@_date: 2018-02-25 21:21:14
That's the "chain" part of blockchain.  I was referring to the "block" part.
The chain part allows for transactions to be audited back to the genesis block (yes you're right).  Because each block not only contains a list of transactions, but a hash referencing it's immediate ancestor.
Any node on the network can download the whole blockchain and check each transaction's hash against it's parent's hash to find out if blocks are valid or should be discarded.

If lightning network takes off, you have to think of each channel as "new user" joining the bitcoin network.
Bitcoin can handle about 4 TPS (transactions per second). Meaning 4 new users per second.  Which equates to roughly 340000 new users/transactions per day.
I think 340k new users per day is an adequate number to eventually accommodate the entire world!  (Without substantially raising on-chain fees and the need to increase the block size).
Edit: I did a quick math and to accommodate the 7 billion people, it will take roughly 200 days for everyone to have a channel open on the blockchain.  That's even faster than the number of new user sign ups Facebook had when it was growing.

Have you actually tried to barter or trade gold?  Gold is just inconvenient for large amounts.  You will also get shafted on the spot price because most buyers of gold offer way lower prices than spot.
On the other hand, hodling, transferring Bitcoin is really convenient.  You can also get the actual quoted spot price from an exchange rather than dealing with shoddy precious metal middle men.

Please go ahead and make a new coin (if it's that easy) and achieve adoption.
Bitcoin adoption rate is equal to the network effect. 
Bitcoin is the oldest and has first mover advantage, and the technology behind Bitcoin works!
Bitcoin has the highest level of adoption whether it's exchanges, wallets, miners (hash power/security), investors, businesses supporting it, people following it etc.
If any coin overtakes Bitcoin, it will mean a lot of investors will lose trust in this space in general, because if the king can be dethroned what's stopping the contenders from being dethroned also!?
I believe Bitcoin's success is crucial to the successful adoption of cryptocurrencies in general.
But we don't have really anything to worry about, Bitcoin has carved out a niche for itself as store-of-value, and hopefully with LN it can become a mainstream currency too.

Let me guess: 
1.) they will be brining in new laws to allow only accredited investors to put money in ICOs.  But this will mean ICOs can now offer shares in the company rather than just worthless erc20 tokens backed by nothing.
2). Stricter KYC/AML, and possibly limits on what exchanges can sell you if you're not accredited investor.
3). All fiat money going in to crypto can be traced back to an exchange or another reseller.  Maybe sites like localbitcoins.com will have a harder time operating under these new laws due to their lose KYC/AML.
4). Possibly all crypto "investments" you hold must be declared, to the tax authorities.
They basically want to control all the money flowing in to crypto, know how much coin you hold and deter investors from getting scammed by ICOs.
In a weird way, I see this as good for Bitcoin.  At least they're not outright banning it, but rather giving crypto a legal framework to work by.

Technically, when we say "transactions" on the Bitcoin blockchain, what we're really saying is "a series of inputs (coins) owned by some signing address being moved to another address".  Those inputs (and outputs (change left over)) are really what's crucial in the transactions.
Now, to say you could associated those signed inputs and output with another layer of information, like messaging/emailing (like you say).  The Bitcoin blockchain fundamentally is just a means to securely transfer ownership and has no comprehension of those layers because all it knows is inputs &amp; outputs (which we all call coins).
Could custom blockchains be built to declare ownership of other digital assets?  Sure they can!  And there's already lots attempts to build such systems. 
But the fundamental reason Bitcoin is so successful is because it can be audited by nodes run by anyone.
If a company is going to close their blockchain to the outside world and not deal with anonymous third parties, they're better off just using an SQL database to store ownership.

Mempool is just a block of memory where unconfirmed transactions reside.

They added segwit support.  Improved the overall UI, icons and experience.  Also added the ability to specify Max Send when sending Bitcoin and a custom slider to chose miners fee.  They also included a Double Spend feature, which allows you to resend a stuck transaction (very useful IMO).
In the next release (which I'm also looking forward too) they'll add a fee estimator based on the current fees being paid to miners to process the transactions.  So you'll get the latest minimum fee to pay for the transaction, which could increase cost savings when sending transactions.

I've done many Bitcoin transactions, they're super easy.  You just need your wallet address and you'll receive the funds there.
BTC fees are mining fees. It's the fees people pay every time they use the network.  You set the amount of fee you're willing to pay to get your transaction included in the block.  If you set the fee too low, it might take a long time to get included, which means it will take a long time for the person to receive the coins.

Japan has recognized crypto as Legal Tender.  Meaning Bitcoin in Japan is treated like regular fiat money.
This is huge, and I believe one of the reasons we saw Bitcoin rise as much as it did in 2017.
Japan has taken the lead, unlike China (which outright is trying to ban it).
Chinese government thinks it can do with crypto what it's doing with Silicon Valley companies in China. i.e. ban Silicon Valley companies from China (or make it very hard for them to operate) so a Chinese alternative springs to the forefront.  Like Baidu (Google alternative), Didi (Uber alternative).  I read of many other but the names escape me right now.
Bitcoin isn't a company, China doesn't get Bitcoin, crypto is borderless and it won't be able to ban it like a company.

I believe it will reach $1m by 2020.  I've read up on Network Effect and how long it takes for new technology to become mainstream.  It take on average 13 years (but it can be faster, like I believe will happen with Bitcoin).  We'll be there in 11 max 12 years because of all the money to be made.  Bitcoin has already been around for 9 years, so 4 more years is the upper limit for the Network Effect.
Adoption is key.  If adoption comes (which it's doing by nearly all metrics bitcoin is being measured by) then $1m BTC is inevitable.
Also, for Bitcoin to be taken seriously as a currency it's market cap must grow.  100x growth from here is what's required to an transnational currency giving bitcoin a $20 trillion USD market cap.
Liquidity is also important for currencies, no one "whale" should be able to manipulate the market easily, which means daily trading volume also needs to go up.  Roughly that's now $8 billion USD/daily.   100x that and we will be sitting at $800 billion USD / daily trading volume.
Miners will earn $1.8 Billion USD / daily from their activities.  Mining will get even more competitive and the whole system will feed in to itself.
Lighting will take care of the payments across the network, making Bitcoin a usable currency for the masses.

A business can build their own blockchain too, sure!  But it must have some underlying token/coin.  For what is a blockchain other than a list of transactions on tokens?
Each "block" in a blockchain is just a series of transactions (tokens moving around).  The reason blockchains have the word "chain" in them is because every block also contains a hash referencing it's immediate ancestor.  The "chain" part is what gives blockchains their unique characteristic, of being able to fully audit the transactions back to the genesis block.

Integrating an ASIC in to your phone so the calls or texts you send are free?  Just a guess.  I don't even know if it's feasible?
Or an ASIC in your home router, so your internet bill is reduced?
Maybe if it's in your home router, you lease it (via a phone app) to mining farms in exchange for a fee...  Or, the router you get is free, but when plugged in it starts mining btc for a mining farm/your ISP.  A great new way for ISPs to claw a few dollars extra from their customers each year?

You can replace it anytime you've fully shutdown qt.  Your balance will show when core has downloaded the block with your transaction.  If you bought the coins say last week, it'll need to download 5 years - 1 weeks worth of blocks before it shows up.
Make sure qt has fully shutdown before you replace wallet.dat, as it could be running for a few seconds after the qt windows disappear.

I like this project because they're trying to propagate the block chain to places which might not have cellphone or internet coverage.  I can only see benefits to Bitcoin with this, not to mention the publicity spin "Bitcoin in Space".
If it's anything like the GPS satellites, anyone with a small receiver should be able to verify transactions.  It would be even better if it could relay transactions too, that way bitcoin would be an easy to access international currency.
Think of the possibilities, a cash register with built in receiver so you could accept bitcoin payments without the need for internet, a taxi service with a mini receivers in each cab.. Pay for your rides anywhere in the world with Bitcoin!   You wouldn't need an expensive smartphone with wallet, a very low cost device with receiver/transmitter would be sufficient.  Imagine Trezors having built in receivers, you wouldn't even need to hook your Trezor to a PC!  Mobile phones with tiny receiver chips, you could have a tamper-proof hardware wallet on your phone. You could also build Bitcoin functionality in to home appliances like TVs, fridges etc.  A lot of possibilities open up to Bitcoin when you eliminate the need for internet.

Another good feature might be **Auto Top-Up**.  Where you can *pair* two addresses and when one address falls below a certain level, funds are moved from the paired address to satisfy the other addresses limit.  
I was thinking in terms of hot/cold wallets because its such a pain moving funds around from cold storage.  It would be great if funds moved automatically from my cold wallet to my hot as I spent from hot.
Of course, this could also include some daily number of transactions or amounts to stop hackers emptying your cold wallet if they got ahold of your hot wallet.
But moving bitcoins is far the biggest pain for me.  So I usually just leave Bitcoins in the cold wallet because i cant be bothered to move them.

Counterparty enables different coins, with different rules to use the bitcoin block chain for ownership management.
Counterparty "XCP" is a coin used to buy and sell those coins on Counterparty's exchange.
Bitcoin is used to control who owns what.  In the background there's a few btc bits being transferred from address to address when ownership changes.
Because Counterparty uses the BTC block chain for coin ownership and management, regardless of what Counterparty feature you're using, you still need some BTC for the transaction fees.  Also being required to have some BTC handy is the only real little nuisance with Counterparty's stuff, I guess having the power/security the Bitcoin block chain offers, it's a small price to pay.
I know with Ethereum, you'll only need "Ether" for the transactions, but the Ethereum won't be as secure against 51% attacks as the Bitcoin network.. Not initially anyways, or not until (if) it becomes as popular with miners as Bitcoin.
You can buy Counterparty's main currency "XCP" from several exchanges, then take those XCP coins on to counterparty's exchange and buy specialised coins.  It's really all about extending functionality/creating interesting altcoins with Counterparty but using the security of bitcoin block chain.

Why they require IDs? Because they get customers calling their banks and trying to reverse the charges, saying they were under duress when they did the purchase, or that they weren't the ones making the purchase at all.  Most of those guys are liars, a lot of sellers go burnt on Localbitcoins that's why they want IDs now with selfies holding a piece of paper stating what you're buying etc.
Plus, I think they're required to ask for IDs because of KYC/AML. The sellers are seen as Money Transfer Businesses.

I haven't used BTMs.  I think a lot of them are over priced.  I'm in the UK so I have several options.  I mainly buy from two places.    and    Their fees are higher than spot-price of Bitcoin, but I can live with that for the convenience they offer me.  I just put my Bitcoin address in bittylicious, do a bank transfer and I receive my coins.
On Localbitcoins, I have an account and I do bank transfer then the Bitcoin is released in to my account.
Localbitcoins used to be a lot better because the sellers didn't really require IDs or selfies holding IDs.  But now they do.
I still don't mind, it's a small hassle to go through.  I have an account on one UK exchange but it's a hassle to get funds in and out.  Even though the exchange offers better prices, I don't mind paying a small premium on the sites I mentioned for convenience.
To answer your question about BTMs.  I won't ever use one I think because some have a mark-up of 30%.  So if you put $100, you get $70 worth of Bitcoin.  Which is too much IMO.   I've heard some BTMs charge less (like 5%) but it really depends on the operator and you should check the prices and read the terms before buying.

I feel you bro!  One option could be to set aside as much from each pay check as possible and invest small amounts in to bitcoin each month.  Like $50 each week/month whatever you can afford.   But remember, Bitcoin goes up and it goes down too.  But in the long term I believe the trend is bullish!
I believe in Bitcoin as I said so that's why invested 100% net-worth in it.

I made the same mistake in 2011.  I thought I'd save $30 on international transfer fees to mt.gox and wait for a UK exchange before buying bitcoin.  This is when bitcoin was ~$4.  By the time I remembered to purchase bitcoin it had passed $1,000 in 2013!

Lightning Network is the solution to scaling.
Increasing the block size only causes centralisation.
If you increase the block size to 2mb, what's stopping you from increasing it again?  Leading to more centralisation.
After 10 years of Bitcoin, the blockchain is less than 200gb, this is thanks to the small block size.
Plus we have technologies like Segwit which do increase the theoretical block size.

It's not that they're mainly lazy, I believe it's got to with proper security.  Most people don't trust their computers (infected with viruses and malware) and don't know enough to secure their coins properly.  So, instead they just trust an exchange to keep their coins.   They just buy from an exchange with hopes of selling for a big profit later on.
Trading is also an aspect.  Some people need to keep their funds on an exchange because they trade the swings.

I think you should consider hardware wallet if you're serious about investing in bitcoin.  Especially, if you're investing serious sums.  Don't buy a used hardware wallet either, it could be compromised.  Instead buy hardware wallets directly from the manufacturers.

Good question. But there's still a lot of scepticism around Bitcoin for the average person.  Also, the euro has trillions in market cap whereas bitcoin is at ~5 billion. More liquidity is needed in debt based economies.  If bitcoin reached a few trillion in market cap, then it could easily square off and look more attractive than smaller currencies.
If Greece switched to bitcoin, there would need a massive pump on the price.
When btc reaches 100,000 a coin, things will get a lot more interesting.

HODL is best strategy for new investors because nobody knows where the price will go.   I can speak from experience that if I had just HODL'd I would have more bitcoin than all the silly trading I did.
HODL is also good if you believe in the technology.  Because if you're right about the underlying technology the price will follow.

Bitcoin is sound money.  Of course people are going to hodl it.  There's nothing wrong in that.
The idea is sound money sustains its value over time, whereas fiat monies depreciate over time.  So, hodling fiat is a bad idea.
You don't think people will eventually spend their Bitcoin?  I think the will use it to do good things like: starting a business, making large purchases (car, house, whatever).  Fiat monies encourage consumerism, where you keep spending as soon as you get it.  Whereas Bitcoin encourages saving.

This is fundamentally wrong.  You're comparing Bitcoin to the market cap of other payment networks like visa &amp; mastercard.
If Bitcoin was a currency, it would need to be compared to currencies like USD.  According to the CIA, the broad money of USD in circulation is $80tn.  $80tn is far bigger number than $7tn you mentioned for gold/Bitcoin as a store of value.
As a currency, bitcoin could be worth more than if it were only a store of value.
Saying Bitcoin is just a payment network is wrong.  Because you're not taking in to account the actual coins themselves, just the protocol for exchange.

Yes it would... If Bitcoin prices were constant.  But Bitcoin prices move constantly (24/7) so the market would eventually price it in.

Dollar cost averaging is a great strategy.  I think the turnaround to a bull market will be quick this time.
In Jan of 2013 the price for BTC was $13.00.  In June that same year the price spike to $210.00...  Then the bear set in for six months and Bitcoin price more than halved from it's ATH.
In Dec 2013 a rally started again and BTC surpassed $1,000.
The bear market from 2014 to (mid) 2015 lasted 1 1/2 years.
For 2018 It's been over a year from the ATH.  I think we'll see a turnaround soon and right now it's a great time to be entering the market.

It's not like Bitcoin hasn't given to speculators too.  I don't know the percentage but 1,000,000% up from when it first started trading?  Wanting more, more and more seems greedy.
Saying that, Bitcoin has fallen a lot this year too.  I think a rally upwards is due with in the next six months.. I don't see this downtrend lasting longer than that!
@_date: 2019-05-13 22:14:57
Because people are starting to realise bitcoin is the future of money!  Plus, there's a limited supply of Bitcoin so when demand peaks so do prices.

Let me guess: just because bitcoin isn't going up by $1k each day you predict a reversal?   
IMO Bitcoin is undervalued still.  This is a new paradigm with incredible world changing technology.  If you ask me, these prices bitcoin is a steal.

Bitcoin is so futuristic that I feel in awe and eurphoric in it's presence.
This technology is priceless yet we hear ppl bitchin' at a measly $4k.
I believe in the future Bitcoin will be so expensive that you wish you would see these prices again but it won't happen.
Bitcoin is revolutionary, it has the potential to change billions of lives.
I can't say much more because this is that amazing, it leaves me speechless.

I don't think that will easily be possible (not out the box anyhow).  Remember, by default Bitcoin (under Ubuntu) will look to ~/.bitcoin folder at startup.   If you mount an NTFS partition (because you want to share with Windows), that will be listed under your /mnt path.   Two completely different locations.
You'll need to configure Bitcoin under Ubuntu to look elsewhere for the Bitcoin data folder. -  Most probably by passing arguments to bitcoin at startup.
Edit: Yes, I was right about passing arguments.  You'll need to pass e.g. -datadir=/&lt;your ubuntu path to NTFS volume&gt;/bitcoin

This documentary isn't for everyone.  If you have zero knowledge of money and banking, it's a good start.  However, I wanted to see a documentary about Bitcoin, not a history lesson on The Medici Family, Goldsmiths etc.
Like I said, if you're just waking up to finance, it's a good start. However, it had very little *new* to offer me.
One of the best Bitcoin related documentaries i've watched is The Rise and Rise of Bitcoin.  I only wish there were more like this.
If anyone knows of any other good documentary on  Bitcoin, I'd love to know.
@_date: 2019-05-14 10:18:52
Bitcoin is a new paradigm disguised as a get-rich-quick scheme.
The dollar comparison is the best metric we have in judging the health of bitcoin adoption IMO.
Because of Bitcoin's limited supply, when demand peaks so do prices.
Speaking of McDonalds accepting Bitcoin: Bitcoin blockchain doesn't scale too well so we'll have to wait for Lightning Network to become ubiquitous in order for that to happen.   I'd say that's still a few years out but that's what speculators are betting on, the fact that bitcoin will succeed (or not).  I say it will overcome the scaling issues and Bitcoin will become a daily currency.
@_date: 2019-05-26 02:09:31
Bitcoin needs to go up in value as more people join.  It's a sign that it's working.

I think you defended it well.
I'm wondering, if governments create their own crypto, doesn't that just legitimise Bitcoin even more!?
Also, governments love to control things.  I don't think a government backed crypto would be anything like Bitcoin.  It would be more centrally controlled and inflationary. 
Just look at the Petro (which was created by the Venezuelan government).  They've already inflated the Petro by 150%.
IMO the best governments can do is their own version Tether.
So, no need to worry about a government shitcoin anytime soon.

If you use a desktop wallet, I highly recommend Electrum.  It's a light bitcoin wallet, no network syncing and filling up your harddrive.  Plus the interface allows you to do RBF... Which is really useful if you've made a mistake and are in a hurry.

Yes!  You need to copy your chainstate folder (from Windows) and paste it to ~/.bitcoin in Ubuntu.

There's no computational penalty for adding transactions to a block.
The network chugs along and miners receive transaction fees.
@_date: 2019-05-08 17:26:43
I don't think the medium in which you receive/send blocks matters.  The main issue is can the blocks be verified against the Genesis Block?  Satoshi designed the system with that in mind.  As long as you can trace each transaction back to the Genesis Block you're good.
Satellite/broadband/carrier pigeon doesn't really matter.
@_date: 2018-12-20 23:35:54
1). You can transport it around the world instantly, with hardly any fees.
2). It's easier to carry and store.
3). It's easier divisible
4). You can actually *pay* for things using Bitcoin, whereas nearly 
nobody accepts gold as payment.
There's probably more uses but that's all i could think of for now.

It's not too late, BTC is hovering around $9k.  My advice would be stop moping around, dust yourself off and get in there.

As Tim Draper says: "Why would I sell the future for the past?".
I look to follow in his lead and increase my Bitcoin hodlings.
@_date: 2019-05-19 20:11:49
It depends on the person.  I have spent BTC in the past and don't feel guilty about it.
A lot of people use BTC as an investment so they don't spend it.
But in a honesty.  BTC shouldn't be spent on day to day transactions like buying a coffee.  That just causes congestion on the Blockchain.
Instead, when lightning network becomes ubiquitous I think that's when more people will be inclined to spend it, and treat it more like a currency than purely an investment.

Well the US stock market has been going through a correction recently, and Bitcoin keeps going up up up!  My guess is: it depends.  If the recession is severe I'd like to think Bitcoin might become a safe haven for people's money.

It's still early days for Bitcoin, I wouldn't sell just yet because bull rallies don't abruptly end.  I learnt that the hard way during the last bull rally.  You'll regret it more if you don't ride this puppy up to the moon.  You'll have plenty of time to cash out.

No.  But it's getting better.  Eventually, bitcoin should be as private as Monero and other such privacy coins. - It's  software after all.
For now, anonymity is achieved through coin mixing.
