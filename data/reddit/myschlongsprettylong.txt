The mailman is the one giving people the wrong address!

Either provided address is overruled (technical issue) or coinbase for some reason feels the need to give the merchant the option to pick between provided address and the recipient's coinbase account (poor procedure). The guy didn't bother explaining what happened, I can only see what happened on my side.

"Expected behavior" doesn't make it right. What's the use of that?
I'd expect them not to let merchants overrule the provided wallet address.

If that is what happened, Coinbase for some reason gives the merchant the option to ignore the address that is provided.
Can you think of any cases where such a feature would be useful?
A more appropriate version of your metaphor would be if the postman took it upon himself to deliver a letter to the hotel I went to 2 years ago.

I don't know about you guys, but in the light of the Bitfinex fiasco, exchanges blaming their issues on third parties doesn't sit well with me.

Congrats on making bitcoin look like a pyramid scheme.

Or honestly, a Visa/Mastercard/Maestro app that can read QR codes.

Got it too. Are they so confident that the price will remain stable throughout june that they're willing to lose a big chunk of revenue?

They sell paper everything, even the gold they sell is paper. Scan a paper, you've got yourself a digital asset.

Ok, but... my comment was tongue-in cheek. Digital or not, why wouldn't they sell BTC? You buy it, they take their ridiculously high commission, the price fluctuates, you sell it, they take their ridiculously high commission. Would you think it more proper if they were in the Magic the gathering card business?

Time to empty it onto an exchange.

BTC-e has very high fees and no volume.

You're next!

Yep. The only time your coworkers should ever hear of it is the explanation that you cashed out and are retiring.
