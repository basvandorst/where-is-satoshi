I also took this into account and had a few good reason to actually bother escalating this entire issue:
- Coinbase recently fixed user enumeration in the login forms, classifying it as a security issue, however when user enumeration is possible via this method, it is no longer considered a security issue?
- There is an actual risk of phishing as we are talking about currency, and it those phishing, won't care if it's design or not, it can be abused easily and they will take advantage of it
- It's not difficult. The exploit is so easy, that almost anyone could pull it off.
But I do see your point, and Coinbase's point that it was included "by design". I just wanted to share, why the design should be considered insecure and at minimum, why rate limiting should be introduced. (via captcha, ip based block and so on).

Hi, author of blog post here. Most external 2FA providers tell you what to key in, within the web app - so it would be difficult for the attacker to know the keys tone's to place in the voicemail message or greeting.

Thanks man!

Thanks, I appreciate your input, and you're valid in the points of others exploiting whatever I have already found. I was hoping that I wouldn't have to do full disclosure, as it is usually followed by some sort of negative action from the company in question against me. 
I may wait another week or so and if I still am unable to receive a response, I'll look for the next step in eradicating these vulnerabilities.

Done, just posted there now. Thanks for reminding me

Throughout the span of over 2 weeks, I reminded them of the security issues via email (can be seen via the imgur proof in my post). 
Additionally, I also sent multiple tweets over this time, in which they responded to other customers however **completely** ignored me.
Here are my tweets:
After March 18th, I gave up trying to contact them. I will email them once again about a planned full disclosure, and hopefully they will reply.

Hi there,
I've gone ahead with full disclosure here:

I'm the researcher who disclosed the bug to Coinbase. I'm not involved in any sort of negative PR campaign towards Coinbase, and it is much rather in my interest to keep Coinbase running finely rather than trying to take it down.
My bug reports were persistent and it required commitment from myself to continually try and get a hold of Coinbase. The security issue is indeed not of grave nature, but it is indeed a security flaw by design and I **still** think that a proper form of rate limiting needs to apply to their APIs.
It's a shame that I had to do a full disclosure, but it's even more of a shame (even though expected), that people are using a single not so critical bug to push negative PR to Coinbase.
People need to relax, and understand that Coinbase will tackle this one step at a time.

Thanks. I've tried sending multiple emails to their whitehat address as listed on  however have had no response.
I didn't know about that subreddit, will submit now.

I'm afraid of publishing them as both of them would lead to unnecessary exposure of Coinbase users, and/or downtime of some Coinbase functionalities. I'm certain that these vulnerabilties are valid, however it's been a month and I'm losing faith in a response.
