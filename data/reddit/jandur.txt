\&gt; I think you're fooling yourself if you think all your personal information is secure
And I think you're foolish for making claims on a subject that you're clearly ignorant on and lacking sources. You do realize Reddit offers the same types of advertising that FB offers right? Reddit has less data to leverage than FB but they still use that information for targeted advertising and [provide traffic reporting, account managemen]( and campaign planning [to advertisers that spend over $200,000/y](
@_date: 2019-07-16 19:24:40
I mean, that's an article headline. It's not factual. Say what you will about FB but they don't sell data. They sell targeted advertising based on what data they have. It's not like they send Ford your account information.
@_date: 2019-07-16 22:01:03


Their data is the only thing they have to leverage. If they sold the data to advertisers/3rd parties they wouldn't need to give Facebook money anymore. How naive are you? Holy shit man you're that naive. Such a part of the problem lol

As someone who bought at $64 and sold at $1000~, be patient. I haven't touched BTC since I sold last December. With the exception for a few bumps here and there it's been on a downward slide since January. 
We've all seen the Anatomy of a Bubble chart. Ask any economist, a bubble loses 80-90% of it's value. The last BTC bubble lost 70-80% of it's value before recovering and shooting back to a new ATH. Best case scenario is we are bottoming out now, worst case scenario we get down to the 100's again.

Whatsapp is incredibly popular. It has 500m active users per month. 10b messages per day. It's huge in India and a lot of other foreign markets where Facebook probably doesn't have as strong of a foothold.
Facebook wants to extend it's platform to overall communications. It wants you sending Facebook messages instead of SMS. How they integrate Whatsapp into their platform is yet to be seen, but that purchase makes complete sense for them.

I've been through every bubble and crash. This one was so obvious and predictable. Yes you cannot strictly base future performance based on past. But no asset bubble can go parabolic before people take profits and Bitcoin has a very consistent history of cycling. Just let it happen and be ready for the next wave. This has all happened before and it will all happen again.

No it was all done via Silkroad communications. I can't remember which LE agency it was (there were multiple investigations), they went as far as faking the targets murder. Ross thought he had someone killed for money and he did this many times.

Coinbase is different than in exchange in a few ways. The most basic being that coinbase will *not* hold actual currency for you. If you sell on coinbase, they send it back to your back (this will take a few days like a check). A regular exchange you can buy/sell multiple times a day. They will hold fiat or bitcoin and you can cash either out when you decide.
Beyond that exchanges also have tools to buy/sell at certain prices, an order book that allows you to see open orders, volume summaries etc etc. Coinbase is just an online wallet that lets you easily purchase coins via the web.

To an extent yes. Gox has been around the longest so it's kind of the standard setter as far as price goes. Most news outlets quote that price etc. However, in terms of volume, it's pretty much tied with Bitstamp and China now.
Gox has had some serious issues the past several months. The US seized about $5m from their US accounts. They are being sued by Coinlab etc. There have been serious cash withdrawal issues (2-3 months) for people leading to speculation that they are borderline insolvent.
Supposedly if you are in Japan you can withdraw just fine, otherwise I wouldn't touch Gox with a 1,000btc pole right now.

As people like to say, don't invest what you aren't comfortable losing. Do I think bitcoin will crash to $1? No, but who knows? There *will* be minor crashes. Bitcoin goes up a lot, then goes down, but so far has always recovered. Think long-term.

I would be hesitant. I only log into mine from home or work.
If you log into blockhain.info on a computer that say, has a keylogger. Your login details are compromised. Two factor authentication can prevent this, because that key always changes. So in theory, even if someone has your password they still can't log into your account. But if they gain access to your Yubikey or Google Authenticator account you will be in trouble.
@_date: 2013-11-15 19:19:11

Yes if the price goes down $100 you're fucked. But that is no different than if you buy them on localbitcoins. If you buy them at $200 on Friday, and they go down on Monday, you're fucked.
The reason to use Coinbase is convenience. You can instantly purchase coins 30 days after your first transaction. It's basically quality control. They want to make sure your account is real, and that nothing funky happens.

I had an issue with them a while back. I emailed and they responded within 48 hours. What happens to you will vary. I've read that sometimes they will honor old purchase prices etc.
On that note, Coinbase gives you your coins at whatever the price is the instant you click purchase. Just because they transaction took longer to through doesn't mean you get a modified price. If I'm understanding you correctly, you're upset that you didn't get a $30 discount that you wouldn't have gotten had the service worked correctly anyway?

If you are US based the easiest way to purchase coins is through coinbase.com. It will take about 6-7 days to receive your coins, but you will receive them at the price you purchased them for. If you want to trade, you could then transfer them from coinbase to Bistamp.
CampBX is a used based exchange, I don't know where their bank is located. I would caution that the last US based exchange (Bitfloor) had it's bank accounts seized by the feds. CampBX says its fully licensed to operate though.

First purchases getting flagged as high-risk happens a lot. Once they fix it you're good to go. While it seems you want to think that your bad experience is a reflection on bitcoin, it's not. It's not hard to wire money to Bitstamp and it's not hard to buy coins with Coinbase.

Honestly I don't thin it was intentional on their end. I've used their service a lot and have always bought low and received my coins 5-6 days later at the price I bought them for, despite a price increase. 
Coinbase has to work out some kinks, and I understand why people get upset after getting burned (I got burned once myself). At the same time, people just need to calm down.
@_date: 2013-11-12 03:13:35
This really isn't the answer you are looking for, but don't rely too much on what other people think of the price. No one here has the right answer at any given point, outside of dumb luck. The price could go up or down, no one is going to be able to give a good answer.
Anyway, the price has skyrocketed. We just corrected and are going back up. It might be a bull trap. Google that term. Personally, I'd wait a few days, maybe even until next Monday to see what happens. If we don't have another sell off in the near future I think we are good.
$1,000 bitcoins are very possible. It's the $10,000+ number that I question. Then again, if BTC is widely adopted, the price will have to be that high, if not higher. But it sounds too good to be true, so I remain skeptical.
@_date: 2013-10-21 14:58:03
You can. But it depends on your views and overall strategy. You can make money by arbitrage, but you aren't getting your money anytime soon. If you are a long-term holder, ok. But if you need access to your cash within a reasonable time you aren't getting it (from Gox anyway).
Personally, I think Gox has liquidity issues. This isn't some bullshit with their bank.

If cryptocurrency becomes ubiquitous globally, there will need to be alternatives to BTC. LTC makes more sense for in-person retail transactions. Long-term I can see a world with multiple crypto's, LTC very well might be one, but I'm not buying at $15-$20.

Your joy is a little...fucked up for the lack of a better term. 
At the same time anyone who held or bought in at $250 wasn't doing their do diligence in any sense. No market grows 1000% in a matter of weeks/months without a major fallback. Anyone who didn't see a very obvious bubble shouldn't have been playing around. And I say that as an amateur investor at best.
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:48:12
Yes that's basically right. But things are pretty volatile right now. If you are buying at $122 just be mentally prepared to lose 50%+ of that value short term. I'm not saying that will happen. The price has been swinging all over the place lately though.
@_date: 2013-11-20 16:36:03
They will charge you for the value of your coins based on when you ordered, not the price on Monday.

Actually yes, in a way. When you pay for a credit card Starbucks most certainly doesn't get the money right away. And they actually pay a fee to verify that you even have money in your account. Then they have to wait a couple days until the payments even clear. With bitcoin they get the money within an hour or so at a next to nothing fee.

I had my first purchase with coinbase cancelled due to it being high-risk. Since then I have had zero issues with them whatsoever. Others have had issues.

@_date: 2013-11-11 15:33:55
I don't think Coinbase has ever said exactly what coins they keep online vs off. My guess would be that they keep 90% offline, and just shuffle around a pool when they send coins out.
Anyway, Coinbase still isn't 100% secure. If someone is able to access your account, they can dump the coins, cold storage or not. If you want them secured I'd do a practice run of making paper wallets.
@_date: 2013-11-16 20:18:18

Nope. I never said that. I said "I don't know". And I also never even remotely mentioned that mtgox would skyrocket independent of other exchanges, simply that whatever happens tomorrow will partially depend on how they handle the trading volume. I'm not really sure where you got that from.
So, learn to read. And don't be a douche.
@_date: 2013-11-20 16:45:12
Correct. The price on Monday has absolutely no bearing on what you receive in terms of BTC. 
Using easy round numbers (because I'm stupid), say you bought $100 worth of BTC today, and the price was $100 each. On Monday the price of BTC is now $200, you still get 1 BTC delivered on Monday, not .5
A word of warning though. Coinbase has a habit of flagging first transactions as "high risk" and canceling your order. If this happens, you won't get your coins and they will refund your money. It's frustrating, but if you email customer support they will flag your account and you won't have any further issues about being high risk.
@_date: 2013-04-15 14:54:15
This is the simplest explanation anyway. I think people are holding hoping for an influx of new investment to drive the price up before selling off. 
I also think there is a reason we seem to be at a sub 100 equilibrium. It's an attractive pricepoint to people who look at a high of 266 last week and think it will go back that way.

Coinbase is the most convenient way I've found to purchase BTC. People whining that it's not up to their convenience standards are annoying. If you need coins instantly there are other methods. If you need money to trade, plan ahead and properly fund an actual exchange. 
@_date: 2013-10-30 15:16:22
I'm sure other will recommend you store your coins in an offline wallet, which can be complicated.
But as far as blockchain.info is concerned, it's very important that you enable two factor authorization and have a strong password. Also, make sure your computer is virus free, to the best of your ability.

This is my first time using them, and I'm sort of ranting but anyway. They have had my money for 3+ business days (payment cleared etc) and they reversed my transaction. I'll get my money in another 5 days. So that's 8 days I'm out of my money with no coins. Mean while price has gone up and I'm out of a profit. 
Unless they fix the situation soon I won't be using them again.

@_date: 2013-10-30 18:09:28
Will BTC crash again? Probably at some point. Will it recover? Probably. If you are looking to maximize profits by buying low, now is not the time. If we have a dip down to 170-180 in the near future I think that's the best short-term bet.
@_date: 2013-10-04 15:29:33

@_date: 2013-11-07 21:37:34
To be honest, no one knows. Some people will tell you to wait until a big crash. Others will say buy now. My own personal opinion is that if we continue to rise this quickly, we may have a legitimate crash in the next 60-90 days. However, bitcoin has so far always recovered from the crashes. Maybe buy a small amount now to get in, wait a bit and see what happens with the market?
Personally I'm always buying simply to expand my holdings.
@_date: 2013-11-03 00:20:55
If you are in the US Coinbase is easy enough to link to your bank account. They have withdrawl limits though. As do most exchanges. Your best bet is to spread coins over 2-3 places. Maybe Coinbase, Campbx, Bitstamp etc, since they all have withdrawl limits (I think).
Also, assuming this is true, please don't sell them all at once and create a  panic sell off in the market. It will only hurt yourself as well. Sell them slowly over time.
@_date: 2013-04-12 21:21:53
Gox has stated that they want to be very hands off and let the market decided. They have also said that they want their latency to be as low as possible so it *can* handle high volume trading.
So I guess the answer to your question is that it doesn't matter, because for the time being anyway, they don't seem to care.
@_date: 2013-11-03 14:50:29
In no particular order.
You can make a copy of your wallet.dat file to preserve your wallet. You can import this to a client, or to blockchain.info at a later date to restore your wallet.
If you have large sums, spread the coins over multiple wallets.
Every wallet has a public address associated with it. You can also generate multiple addresses for one wallet. This is how you receive BTC.
Bitcoins can be stolen if someone gains access to a wallet and transfers them out. If you have the wallet password or private key the wallet can be compromised. All transactions in BTC are final and cannot be reversed. The transactions are public, but unless you know who owns that wallet address you'll likely never know where your BTC went.
I think.

BTC is perfect for Africa, as others have mentioned. Mobile payments are already big there, and a lot/most(?) countries have unstable currencies.

Ohh edgy developer is edgy.

According to the criminal complaint anyway...He was administering SR through a VPN via a publicly available wifi hotspot near his house. Once they had an idea of his identity from the clues he left they could have started snooping his traffic. Subpoenaed the VPN host etc.

Yes. But the systems aren't exactly fast, so it's risky.
@_date: 2013-10-11 18:29:19
I am. And I trust them to do cold storage better than myself.
@_date: 2013-11-12 03:37:24
Yeah ok.

My bank account was verified within 24 hours. I'm still waiting for my MtGox account to be verified though....

You are seriously picking a fight over one word someone wrote. Not to mention the fact "our" can be used in different ways. My wife is foreign, if I say "our" country it's a possessive. "In Chine, us American's biggest competitor" etc.

Yes, yes I am. I do the same thing in real life. Most of my spendable money is in my bank account. But I do keep some cash under my mattress for a rainy day. 
If my coinbase account continues to grow significantly I eventually will move some over into my own cold storage. But right now I don't feel I have a significant amount of wealth at risk.

I think it's more likely that criminal organizations are trying to game the system. The government wants to regulate and tax this as revenue. 
@_date: 2013-10-17 02:15:33
That took what. A whole two weeks? Disappointing Hollywood.

There are multiple reports of this across the web. Applying both to checking and savings. Just sayin.

I've seen a lot of posts with people having issues with BTC-e lately. Accounts being compromised?
@_date: 2013-04-15 15:32:42
I deposited at Bank of America and my money posted within an hour.

If you don't want to create an online account, Localbitcoins.com is your route.

Emerging markets, countries with unstable currencies/banking systems etc. These are the places that will fuel initial bitcoin growth. In my totally uneducated opinion. 
@_date: 2013-08-15 15:28:31
Exactly. What the fuck are they going to investigate.
@_date: 2013-11-07 19:14:05
And you can't/don't want to deal with an online exchange?
@_date: 2013-04-12 17:00:47
I think people are severely over-estimating the effect that HFT traders are having on bitcoin. The volume isn't really there for them to make money and it's clear the exchanges can't handle anything remotely near true HFT speeds.
@_date: 2013-11-08 21:35:51
Yeah right. Maybe by some stroke of luck.

Jesus Diaz is horrible. So is Sam Biddle. Between them and Gawkers latest re-format I've stopped reading all together.

A phrase you hear a lot is bitcoin is work nothing, or infinity. So, depending on who is correct...
