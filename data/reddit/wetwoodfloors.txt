But what if Wall streets goal is to make USD stronger? After all, they are trading and sharing companies which all use USD, they won’t want to see their other company investments drop.

Thank you for the comment �� I will hodl forever.
@_date: 2017-12-03 09:59:06
yeah, 
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:00:07
Okay so it’s like supply and demand, once people buy in and it’s up to 10 million, their aren’t enough people that can buy back for the 10mil, forcing you to hodl. Makes sense thanks
@_date: 2019-11-03 03:29:50
Yeah but it’s a wallet from bitcoin.org a trusted wallet
@_date: 2019-10-25 23:05:27
Well here’s a problem, I messed up (maybe?) I have about .1 BTC that I’ve been DCA from coinbase to BRD wallet for 2 years now. And I just read on this subreddit that sending to the same address is “not good”.  So now, should I send my .1 BTC  to my green wallet? Or do you think I’m fine if I keep sending my coinbase funds to the same BRD wallet? (BTW I haven’t withdrawn anything from BRD yet, it’s strictly my “savings account”. If that helps)
@_date: 2019-10-25 22:37:23
So what would be my actions to spend? Should I send from my wallet I collect all DCA to another wallet and then spend?
@_date: 2019-06-27 09:08:56
Yeah I used a bitcoin random word generator, in a nutshell I mixed up the words that it gave me. 
I copy and pasted each word from the site into the seed, is that safe enough?

Any iOS wallets you recommend that lets you set a 1 sat fee? Thanks for all the info btw

Isn’t it like 30x faster internet that can download 500mb in 5 seconds? And can replace WiFi in houses?
@_date: 2019-04-03 09:28:15
No only $5 thank god! Lol

She said $5 and they were elderly. Selling their grandsons stuff with their own.

What are the risks in Exodus suffered from a hack? Are my coins safe because I have the 24 word seed?
@_date: 2019-05-11 06:25:42
What is the best iOS / Android app? Are wallets safe on your phone?
@_date: 2019-05-15 00:46:20
Okay I tried searching but I don’t really know what to look for sorry I’m a crypto noob rn.
@_date: 2019-05-11 06:44:35
I have an extra iPhone I will keep on airplane mode and not connected to the internet. Will that change anything?
@_date: 2019-05-15 09:15:24
Sweet I’m HODLing till I die then.
@_date: 2019-05-15 00:48:49
Thanks for clearing that up! I appreciate the time you took to comment, you cleared everything up for me!
@_date: 2019-05-07 09:28:12
What do you think 0.1 would be worth? If you had to guess? Thanks for commenting!
@_date: 2019-05-07 08:25:07
How would I do the math? Thanks for the reply!
@_date: 2019-05-11 06:28:20
Is Gemini safe for storing? It says they have an offline cold storage feature.
@_date: 2019-05-17 15:00:23
I’m thinking way far into the future when bitcoin is the only currency? How do you know these companies are honest. Human nature will always have a level of greed imo. What if these guys get up and leave the country with a database full of your private keys? Am I paranoid? Maybe?
@_date: 2019-05-13 01:25:52
Cool thanks for the help!
@_date: 2019-05-11 05:24:13
What about ETN? Electroneum?
@_date: 2019-05-13 01:37:53
Awesome! Good find they support all of the coins I am HODLing! Thanks!
@_date: 2019-05-15 09:21:27

Maybe I’ll just go paper wallet route, thanks for the reply.
@_date: 2019-05-07 09:34:35
I’m going to keep investing every 2 weeks! I’m exited now!
@_date: 2019-05-17 14:34:05
But what happens AFTER technology? Think BIGGER
@_date: 2019-05-07 09:35:46
I will hodl and keep collecting! Thanks for helping me out with your comments ��
@_date: 2019-05-07 11:07:17
Wow okay!
@_date: 2019-05-13 01:23:41
So if I have the seed words I could, for example use “green” or other 24 word seed wallets to restore?
@_date: 2019-05-07 08:51:43
Cool I’ll research more about it! Thank you for your time. Cheers!
@_date: 2019-05-17 23:09:39
Okay sweet thanks
@_date: 2019-05-17 14:57:20
I’ll just send my BTC to my BRD wallet on my old phone and keep my old phone in airplane mode.
@_date: 2019-05-07 08:23:49
Basically I can afford about $200 (100 per paycheck) a month on Bitcoin without it hurting me.
@_date: 2019-05-07 09:33:22
Wow so you think Bitcoin will get to 1 million in 3 years? I sure hope so!
