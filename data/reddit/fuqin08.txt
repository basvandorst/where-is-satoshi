turn the K-line to four hours level. On the four hour level, we can see that MA6 crosses MA18 and has entered a long position, and there is a sign that MA18 has started going flat.  we emphasized that SAR was the first to move into the long position the other day, and so far the whole coin price has been running in the long position. So here we can think about making a four-hour platform shock zone: $6120-$6521. Considering that the pressure on the daily line level still remains, so the possibilities of a big rise is unlikely, but there is a platform shock trend on the 4-hour level, so we can do high throwing and low suction based on the area we've just designated. Creating a position, it is best not to operate over 30% in this position, and the stopping loss place should be near $6120 below.

The low-point support line is mainly based on the lowest price link hit by the first two bottom single-needle bottoms. We can regard this line as the last bottom supporting line of long’s rebound,and the price is the lowest price which miners can stand.This price doesn't have to be reached, so we made the first supporting line of the rising channel from the bottom of the solid K line at the first two bottoms. From this line of support, we can see that yesterday, when the price of the coin was the lowest, it just reached about $6,300 on this line. Later, the price of coin was back to make the support line effective. For the time being, there is a sign of stopping. Today, the price of the currency mainly shocks around $6,500. From the K-line graph of the daily line level, we can see that MA6 already entered the short seller, MA18 has not yet.From the trend of the narrow fluctuation of the currency price today, it feels like it has stopped falling, but we can see that the K-line pattern on this day is still [unsatisfactory]( The position of the first support line of the ascending today is about $6,350. As long as the currency price does not fall below this price, then we can temporarily see that the price of the currency rebound is still in the rising channel, which is a relatively strong trend in the adjustment.

We switched the K line to the 4 hour level. A few days ago we set a platform shock zone for everyone on the 4 hour level: $6,120 - $6,500. That is to say, the overall operation of the position part is mainly based on this platform. The key concern here is the platform support level of $6,120 below. This is not a valid break below. If the price falls below this level, it is equivalent to breaking the platform to form a downward relay. Therefore, the position is also to be controlled by the risk control. Ok. Of course, if you are a conservative investor, this kind of early-stage trading can actually give up. If you wait a little longer, you will not lose money. Anyway, you don't have the momentum to rise sharply anyway.

From the following K-line graph of the daily line level, we can see that the MA6 still operates in the short form so far. The overall price change of the two days has not changed much, but it can obviously feel the MA6 on the daily line level. Back pressure still exists, the price of the currency is difficult to stand on the MA6 and thus drive the MA6 to turn head. These two days we have said in the video, because the KDJ indicator on the daily line level is still in a state of serious oversold, this is the end of the previous wave of shorts, but the overall trend has not been reversed, so the overall transaction here belongs to The front-end part of the left-hand trading is only suitable for the bottom position of the position. The short-term line does not have the kinetic energy to rise sharply, and it takes time to run-in.

We switched the K line to the 3rd level. From this figure, we can see that the currency price started a wave of depth callback after the failure of breaking the half-year line on July 27. We have previously set the second target price of Bitcoin's rebound at Fibonacci's 0.618: 7492 US dollars. The key point is that this is the heavy pressure zone for this round of rebound. From the 3rd line below, we can see at this time, the position of the MA180 is just around $7,556, and the gap between our second rebound target is only a few dozen dollars. So basically the pressure to confirm multiple times around $7,500 is very large. Now the price of the currency is around $7,250, and the distance between the heavy pressure zone is only about $200, which is about 3%. This space is very small, so we do not recommend the action of adding a position here because The wind report is obviously not worthwhile. If the price of the currency effectively breaks through the pressure zone of $7,500, then it is not too late to add the position, because this is equivalent to a rebound into the reverse. If the price of the currency is too late to touch the heavy pressure zone of $7,500, then this price is just the place where we profited. This is the operation plan you should have now.

 From daily K-line level chart, we can see that the recent currency price has a tendency to stop falling around $6,100. The J value in the KDJ indicator is at the -7 position, indicating that the short-term line is still in an oversold state,and there is a small rebound demand.However, we also saw from the upper K line that MA6 is still in a strong bear position at this time. The price of coin has rebounded but not achieved breakthrough and gained pressure to fall, therefore, we see that the short-term currency price is close to the trend around August 9th. Here is the need to have a platform to oscillate to ease the emotional venting of short sellers and at the same time to accumulate power for longs

The DASH is the strongest currency in this wave of mainstream currencies that we've seen in the video the day before. Today it's the first time to form buying point on the daily level. We can see from the k line chart on four hours level below. In fact, after the long green line around 16:00 yesterday, the entire MA6 and MA18 have already entered the long position to form a buy-point structure. And the next 12 hours, all can be bought. Today, the price of coins achieves a breakthrough , so that the line level also began to enter the long position. However, due to the opening of the Boll on the 4-hour level, the price of the currency has already touched the upper track of Boll, so although it is a buying point structure, it is not recommended to chase it directly.  Paying attention to MA6 on four hour level and based on MA6 to do low suction is a better choice

According to the daily level line performance, both MA6 and MA18 have entered longs and form support for the rebound of price of coin.The green column below the MACD is constantly increasing, indicating that the longs are very strong.However, in the position of $6,700, the current currency price has been shocked for three days. In the past three days, the price of the currency has not been able to reach a new highlight, so it is necessary to pay attention to this. We can look at the position of $6,700 as a small platform. In addition to our previous observation of the time period of platform consolidation, the more important time node is around the 6th day, which means that the currency price will make a directional choice in the next three days. At present, because the trend is beneficial to many parties, we still maintain the bargain-hunting and buy-in. The bottom-end chips in the previous period continue to be held, and the short-term support is mainly MA6.
@_date: 2018-08-24 08:04:15
The trend of the currency price is favorable to multiparty . On the daily level, MA6 and MA18 have formed support for the rebound of the currency price. At this time, MA18 is still in the form of short seller. If the price of the currency does not rise sharply in recent days, it is expected to form longs after about three days. We can accumulate in a low price on four hour level based on the Boll Middle Track.

In the past two days, we have been emphasizing that because the price of coins has risen too fast, Boll has not been able to keep up with the track, so there is a need to do a platform consolidation. From yesterday's and today's entire K-line trend, we can also see that the current mode of operation of the currency has entered the trend we expected, and now the Boll track will continue to run upwards to open the space.
From the K-line graph of the daily line level, we can see that the MA6 and MA18 still maintain a very strong long-head shape and run upwards. Today, the MA18 has been running to: about $6,568, further reducing the medium-term cost and current price gap. Before we have emphasized that the important time period for platform is 6 days. Today we can see it as the platform for the second day, which means that it takes three to four days to move in such a narrow range. As long as the price of the foreign currency is maintained at Fibonacci 0.382: US$6,878 for platform, the medium-term cost of MA18 will increase a lot after three to four days, making the cost of short- and medium-term positions further increase to reduce the selling pressure of the profit market in the later period when it continues to rebound. Yesterday we also stressed that the J value of KDJ value is relatively high, and there is a need to repair the overbought in the short term. Today's trend is also in line with this words. The slight decline in platform consolidation is a relatively normal phenomenon. The main concern is that the currency price $6,878 cannot be effectively broken,because this is an important support level for the platform in the long-term pattern. As long as the currency price remains at this price,  it is not a destructive form, and the chips of low-sucking and add-position in the early stage can continue to be held. However, because it is necessary to wait until the specific direction will be selected, so it is definitely not suitable for adding position. Off-site funds are temporarily suspended, and they will make a decision after the repairing finished.

Last night, the price trend of Bitcoin was quite thrilling, because the intraday price fell below Fibonacci 0.382: $6,878. But fortunately at the close of yesterday, the price of the currency returned to the support level again, so the chips in the early stage can still be held. We have repeatedly stressed that Bitcoin needs to do a platform shock to clean up the float and raise the medium-term cost of 18 days. Focus on the 6-day time period. Today is equivalent to the third day of the platform shock. In other words, it should be there are three days to observe, so it is not appropriate to add or pursue in this period of time.
From the KDJ indicator below, we can also see that the overbought repairing is gradually being completed, and there are signs of forming a dead fork in the short-term, so in the recent platform shock trend, the currency price is likely to go down again to do the temptation. . For such a situation, we need to focus on the fact that the daily closing price is still not able to fall below the support level of 6,878 US dollars. If the closing price of the currency falls below such a price, then we can throw the chips of the previous period. The position left a confirmation that the position will continue to wait for the break. As long as the currency price remains above $6878, there is no need to do anything. We also stressed that the heavyweight zone for this round of bitcoin rebound is not here. The heavy pressure zone is at $7,492. According to normal circumstances, at least it should be challenged.

this issue was retried .
@_date: 2018-08-29 09:16:17
We can hold our bottom chips,but it is not suitable to add chips here. At present, the target price of this round of rebound can be moved up to Fibonacci 0.618: about 7492 US dollars, which is also the heavy pressure of rebounding. The best way is that takes the price of the coin: 6878 USD as the platform support and take a small platform adjustment. On the one hand, increase the average chip cost of 18 days. On the other hand, clean up the float chips. And the short-term profit is a bit big, and the rush to rise is not conducive to the reverse of the later market .The intersection of the downtrend line and the second target rebound is generated on September 14. That is to say, if the price of the coin is postponed to this time, or if the price of coin tries to break through later, the pressure will be relatively small, which is advantageous for the longs .
