I saw one come down and fall off the table, with the 'old' block still on it. Then the block fell again and stayed on the table, with the older one still there. I think if the new block falls off the table, it then falls again back onto it until it stays. Just my guess.

It's a stretch to compare craigslist with ebay. One is primarily (or at least originally) auction based while the other is more of a 'classifieds' model. AFAIK, ebay does not offer Bitcoin payments, but they should of course. I agree with what you said about the couch for sale, well put.

This is a great idea, considering Craigslist is primarily a cash based system to begin with. However, the limited nature of cash means many craigslist transactions are local. This could open the doors for more regional or international transactions, provided the escrow approach is trustworthy and functional. Hell, Craigslist could host their own wallet services, like rush wallet, except that it would have escrow built into it with the Craigslist system.
If craigslist isn't already looking into this I would be very surprised. I don't see any downside to it, since craigslist, IMHO, has a dubious reputation to begin with.

I've learned that the best practice when spending funds from a paper wallet is to 'sweep' all the funds off that wallet first into a hot wallet. Then you spend what you need, and send the rest to another cold storage address.
Blockchain.info will recommend you 'sweep' all the funds from a paper wallet when you import/scan a private key.

I agree with Dan K. that it is inevitable. With the onslaught of asic hardware, there is no competition from would-be CPU/GPU miners. Thus, mining becomes something done by a minority of potential miners out there. There is more to the reasoning behind this that I wont get into. I heard the same podcast and I thought Andreas' analysis was spot on, especially his quote from Satoshi's white paper about "one vote per cpu" [paraphrased].
My concern is whether litecoin might be seen as a better long term solution and all the money going over to that currency, leaving bitcoin near worthless.

Nice work. However, I'm a bit confused about the utility of proving a URLs existence, since the content of the URL can change any time, thus there is no way to know the site existed at that time. Am I missing something?
Also, people need to be careful when hashing documents such as legal, etc. If the document changes in the smallest way (think PDF image compression algorithm changes) then the hash will be different, rendering the POE worthless.
Great work though, I'm really intrigued by this concept and the similar concept of smart property.

I think the reverse-split is part of this, and could be confusing. However, with the large ratios (unlike stock ratios around 2:1), the change would be obvious. You're balance would go from , say, 200 BTC to 2 BTC. Sure seems panic-inducing, but once you're aware of the split, it would make more sense. Also, I wouldnt expect sudden changes, I'd imagine a bit of marketing happening before the change occurs. Online wallets providers would inform their users of it, etc.

Back in 2010 I came across bitcoin on reddit and visited Mt. Gox as a result. I remember looking at the price chart and thinking it was a weird name for an exchange. Fast forward 3 years (last spring) and I totally grokked bitcoin and started putting money into it all summer. Lately I've been obsessed with thinking that back in 2010 I mined bitcoin and forgot all about it, so I've been searching my hard drive for signs of a wallet, etc. Crazy, I know it's not there, but I have this feeling like I really missed out on something big.
