First, I never said because the price is lower the coin will rise more.  I said a lower priced coin allows the buyer to get more of them AND IF the lower priced coin increases in cost, because you have more, you’ll most likely do better, especially if you’ve only put $100 in it.  
He has .007% of a Bitcoin.  If Bitcoin hit $40,000 they’d make $180 on that $100.  People act like they are getting rich on $100.  Ain’t gonna happen.  Not on Bitcoin.  Not now.  Hell, if it hit $100,000 you’d make $600.  Lambo time?
If you bought ETN at $0.08 you’d have 1,250 ETN.  Now, if that ETN goes to $1.00 you’d make $1150.  Which is more likely?  Bitcoin at $100,000 or ETN at $1.00?  Who knows?  I’m just saying you aren’t getting rich on $100 of Bitcoin.  
I didn’t advise he/she buy any specific alt-coin so don’t put words in my mouth.  I just suggested he/she consider it because the people that got rich on Bitcoin bought when it was cheap and they bought a lot of it and they sat on it.  If anything I suggested that.  A newb can’t buy a lot of Bitcoin when it’s $15,000 each.  You know what you can get?  More of an alt-coin and a dream.  A dream like Bitcoin buyers had when that was $0.02 each.
His/her question implied there is a ‘next’ to do.  
The popular answer will be...buy more.  Dollar cost average more Bitcoin.  Forever.   This will be the popular answer.  Just keep buying more, as you can afford, no matter what, and hold it, forever, but, expect you can lose it all at any moment so treat it as such.

$100 of Bitcoin, which right now is $14,083.  That gives you like .007% of one Bitcoin.
Let’s, for fun, say Bitcoin jumps to $50,000.  That means .007% of that is $350.
So, if, and that’s IF, Bitcoin jumps to $50,000, which is WAY WAY WAY above where it is now, you’ll have made $250.  Good luck retiring on that.
My point is, the money has been made on Bitcoin, unless you can buy ONE entire one (or more) and then sit on it/them and wait for growth and not panic sell on the huge dips.
I am not recommending this, but for example, ETN is like $0.08 each.  $100 of that gives you more, like a decent number, thus if it goes up you stand to make more.  Doing that when Bitcoin was sub-dollar is what got little people rich.  Buying $100 of something at $14,000 isn’t going to do that.  
I think if I had a spare $100 I’d look to buy alt-coins with the mentality I was going to lose it all.  Then I’d just forget about it for 20 years.  Things like Ripple or Dash or ARK or ETN or IOTA or ADA or XMR or Lord knows what.  I’m no expert.  
I’m just saying you aren’t getting rich on $100 of Bitcoin, and the buy/sell fees and taxes are too high for you to day trade that $100 into some fortune.  That’s my utterly worthless 2-cents.
Good luck.
