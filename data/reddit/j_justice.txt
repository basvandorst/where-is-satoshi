You joke about as400, but I've worked in at least 2 IT departments for companies that still use that steaming pile of shit, Lol.

I've been lurking since the Blabs scandal. I was really tempted to make a stop by their office when I realized it was only 15 mins down the road..

These guys are actually located about 15 mins from me, and I'll be picking up at least 1 Jalapeno (4.5 ghs) model next week. With the $150 price tag it should break even pretty quickly. They're also not set to ship most of their units until June(ish), so it shouldn't spike that quickly. I'm hoping to pay mine off, and make a little profit before the difficulty spikes like crazy.

I'd happily trade my small mountain of student debt for that. It's really one of the only things ruining my credit, and it's doing a damn good job.

I saw that their worst unit was at 195w. I think that was for the 60gh/s unit, which is still less than half of what a GPU miner would use for a fraction of that many hashes. Still completely worth it, IMO.

Less efficient, but this will be my first mining venture and I'm not ready to drop $600+ on a machine. The smaller $150 should pay itself back pretty quick, and then I can gauge how far I want to dive in :)

Yea, for me, even at 195w it's around $10 a month.

So when BFL finally starts delivering these, and they aren't on crazy backorder and available to purchase (say Q4 2013), will the difficulty be spiked by the 20k+ units that will already be in use making a single unit pretty useless/unprofitable?
Also expecting a pretty decent drop in price when the bulk of these hit due to the increased flow of blocks being solved. Should be a good time to buy in anyway ;)

Well, the Jalapeno uses such minimal power. Just a couple dollars a month in the US. As a hobby miner, if I could still make $30-40 a month in BTC, it would still be worth it. I just worry that once the big bulk of ASICs go out, that it will push the gains down to the point of being negligible (&lt;=$10 in BTC)

This is a VERY good resource. I wish I had known about it prior to some experiences I've had.

It is, but there is still going to be a huge influx of blocks solved before the difficulty adjusts itself, and it will take a relatively short period of time for that to happen once more ASICs are out there. I'm expecting at least a small price drop when that happens as there will be a large chunk of coins flooding in before the difficulty increases sufficiently.
