A congress mind you that is appointed by the people of this nation of ours. If you want change vote and campaign for the candidate you think should be the next senator or congressman for your district/state. Also I choose my name because of my love and participation in student congress which actually gets shit done unlike real congress.

I feel like many people in this thread don't know what the Federal Reserve is.... And to clear things up about the public vs private argument. The Federal Reserve is both Public and Private. The Feds board of governors is appointed by the president and approved by the Senate which makes it a public institution. While the Fed can sell and buy bonds from banks and make over night loans to banks who don't make there capital to asset ratio which makes it private.

Ben Bernake and Janet Yellen previous and current leaders of the federal reserve didn't work for banks prior to the appointments. The government appoints technocrats which are basically people who are the best in there field in this case that would be Macro and Microeconomics. The reason for this is because you don't want a politician in this position who has a degree in law or a degree that is irrelevant to the monetary policy that governs our money supply.

They are bound by law to give what excess profit that doesn't go towards paying salary's, reinvestment in maintenance, or repairs on there buildings, or paying interest on maturing bonds to the federal government. They don't "rape the entire world" and to think so is being ignorant of the laws and regulations they are forced to follow, and how important the value of the US dollar is the rest of the world as one of the most stable and trusted currencies.

I admire the confidence in your stance. But if you wouldn't mind could you name for me one member of the board of the governors that used to run for a large banking or financial prior to there appointment to this position?

Considering they are required by law to make reports concerning the current state of the economy and there monetary practices every 6 weeks. I think they are pretty transparent.

They don't have gold holdings. They are in charge of the money supply and how much of said money they receive from the treasury to put into circulation. Gold holdings is under the Dept. Of Treasuries jurisdiction not the Feds.
