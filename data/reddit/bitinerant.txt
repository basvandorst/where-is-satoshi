Besides being inefficient and opaque, the DTCC is already corrupted to its core. 
[Listen to Bix Weir on the DTCC](
The DTCC closed-book ledger has been corrupted exactly because it is closed-book.  
The only ownership of anything is the power to control it... to benefit from it... to hold it in your hands.

Haggling with Chinese to get 8mb instead of 4? Sounds about right.

"awarded" is the wrong word; he is being given back some of his own earned money.

Hmm the bank said the fraudulent transfer came from her own IP. That's really suspicious and needs some explanation

Cash is being abolished as we speak: 
* [March 2015: people who live in France will not be allowed to make payments of more than 1,000 euros ($1,060) in cash](
* In US, the Bank Secrecy Act forces banks to report any transaction involving at least $10,000 in cash
* Cannot bring more than $10,000 USD or 10,000 Euros across borders
* [Last Week Tonight with John Oliver: Civil Forfeiture] ( Cops will take cash off you, no crime required.

It's an excellent strategy to pilot Bitcoin-payments in a small market, learn from the experience, and then roll out to the bigger markets.

Making everything illegal is a deliberate strategy to increase gov't control: If everyone is guilty of something then the Justice Dept has the power to *selectively* prosecute anyone.  This bill could mean that Bitcoin entrepreneurs can be coerced into cooperating with whatever the gov't desires, or else be prosecuted.

It's not correct to say Facebook Payments are free, because that ignores the fact that Facebook still has to pay network fees to the visa/mastercard network, and your bank's debit-fee.  Just because Facebook pays the fees doesn't mean it's free, Facebook will lose money on every transaction.  They'll cross their fingers and hope they make it up in Ad revenue, but it doesn't mean they've invented a FREE payment network.

Casares gave an interview about the potential of Bitcoin, including why Bitcoin is even more useful to the unbanked people of the developing world because they need a place to securely store and transfer money on their cell phone.
Then you read the comments on Business Insider below the story.  Did these retards even read the article?  A lot of people who don't understand Bitcoin are the first to say why it's impossible.
