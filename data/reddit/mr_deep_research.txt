Nobody who has any money is going to buy any fake internet money.
The only people buying it in bulk are VCs who have raised money from other people to risk on Internet tokens and that's because they have investments in companies in the area and want the hype to keep going.
They are not risking their own money and get 20% of the upside (as well as a 2% annual management fee).

Bitcoin has never been decentralized. The developers control it. And there's a second group that controls it, the miners. And the two don't have the same incentives and the developers don't even agree what blockchain is the real bitcoin.

The CME contracts can't collapse the price.
The reason is simple. The price is 100% manipulated by the exchanges. They can print it higher. They can print it lower. Sure, when they don't allow sellers to drop the price, they have less volume. But they don't care because it is more important for the price to increase.
So, what will happen when futures trade is this..
the futures price is based on the price on 2 bitcoin exchanges. Those bitcoin exchanges will buy futures themselves, simply print the price in the direction of the future and then sell that future for a profit. Then they will do it again and again and again.
If you want to trade futures, you are trading against an exchange that is setting the price itself and trading on it. They have 100% accurate information about the price in the future and you have none. They win every time. No matter how you play it, you will lose.
And they will keep printing the price in the direction they want.
So, the CME futures will only make the exchanges rich and anyone who tried to play the futures broke. And CME won't care because they get transaction money in any case.

When Apple stock increases in price, it means you need more USD to buy stock in Apple.
When Apple stock decreases price, it means you need less USD to buy stock in Apple.
So, what do you mean by "if the USD drops"? Against what? Are you trying to say:
"if the USD drops in value against Apple stock, then Apple stock will should drop in value too" 
which is the same as saying:
"when it takes more USD to buy Apple stock, it should take less USD to buy Apple stock"
The basic problem you are having is you are conflating USD and assets priced in USD. The USD is a currency, it is not an asset. It is what things are priced in. You don't price USD in USD.

If you are keeping dollars in a bank and getting interest, you don't own dollars. Dollars pay no interest.  Even if you are keeping dollars in a bank and getting no interest, you don't own dollars. You own a loan to a bank. It is priced in dollars.
If someone holds £100 in currency today, next year they have £100 in currency.
And if they bought sweets today, those sweets are going to be worth a lot less next year as food stuffs are perishable. Same with depreciation with the vast majority automobiles and cell phones.

Nobody with any money keeps their money in dollars. The USD is a currency, not an asset. 
And most people with 100s of million and billions including companies (like Apple, etc.), state governments and even the federal government are net short the dollar. They issued bonds (debt) or have other loans.
And anyone with a home mortgage is short the dollar.
The threat is not inflation but DEFLATION. Look at what happened after the real estate crash circa 2008. And the Great Depression.
and "cryptocurrency" (which is not a currency) is not a threat to the USD. Magical tokens are only a threat to those who buy them, they are not a threat and do not affect anyone who avoids them.

You can't short bitcoin. To short bitcoin, you'd need an account on an exchange where you'd borrow bitcoins and sell them.
The exchange could:
- cover your short whenever they wanted, forcing you to buy the bitcoins back at whatever arbitrarily high price they chose.
- tell you you can't withdraw any money because.. verification, fraud, cat ate my hamster
- tell you to deposit $$$ and then laff at you
- disappear one day with all the mad gainz you thought you had

There are zero "safe" investments that return 5% to 10% in USD at the current time.
The reason is simple. I can borrow millions at 3% right now. If I could find a safe 3% investment that matched the term of that 3% loan, I could make money risk free.
And banks can borrow at even a lower rate than I can.
There is no rate higher than the risk-free rate that is risk free. That is why it is called the "risk free" rate.
There are trillions of dollars looking for "safe" investments every day that return higher than the risk free rate. If there was one, trillions of dollars would go to buy it up until it was priced the same as the risk free rate.
There is no free money out there. It all entails risk. Saying there is a "safe" investment that returns 5%-10% right in USD terms is completely and utterly incorrect.

Bitcoin can easily be printed out of existence. The developers can make a one line code change to do it, chainging the block reward to a fixed value. Miners would be happy with the change. Users would be stuck with it.
There are 3.88% more bitcoins added to the supply every year at this point. It is planned to go to zero but if it does, the miners won't be able to make money so they won't process transactions and transaction fees will skyrocket.
At that point, the developers will fix the inflation rate at 4% (around what it is today and higher than the CPI of the US dollar) and the users will support it because they don't want to pay high transaction fees.

Lending has always existed. Lending will always exist. All banks do is borrow money (deposits are money lent to banks) and lend it out.
Banking is not a creation of a government. See my example above with bitcoin. if you can convince people to deposit bitcoin with you, you can create as many bitcoins as you want. You can be a bitcoin bank and create bitcoins.
In fact, a number of bitcoin exchanges act as banks. When they lend bitcoins on margin, they are lending. When they lend, they are creating more bitcoins, just like when a bank lends it is creating more money.
If you could borrow a car from someone for nothing, what would the value of cars be? Not much. It is not how many of something there is that makes it valuable (if it has value), it is how easy it is to get access to that thing. And that is what lending and borrowing is all about.
So, go fuck yourself. LOL
@_date: 2018-05-28 14:37:16
If a bank makes some bad loans it is fine. All banks have some bad loans. Lots of bad credit card debt out there. That's why they charge high interest to bad credit customers. The ones who pay need to make up for the losses of the ones who don't.
The Fed doesn't bail out those loans. Banks can borrow from the Fed. The Fed doesn't give banks money. If a bank's loan portfolio is messed up and gets shut down, the FDIC takes the hit. The FDIC is paid into by the banks. When a bank gets shut down, the vast majority of the time it is merged with another bank by regulators before it totally blows up.
Banks submit to that regulation because they want access to the Fed as a lender of last resort, to FDIC insurance and to FHLB loans and other borrowing.
I don't understand the rest of your post. The people who pay for loan defaults are the people paying interest on loans they take out. 
The interest from someone paying their mortgage (like mine) goes to pay bad loans from other people (like people who buy too much on a credit card and default). I have a $2 million mortgage at around 3.4%. I'm paying $68K a year in interest. I'm happy to do it and that's $68K a year that someone can default and the bank is still even for the year.
The $2MM mortgage came from deposits to the bank, then I bought the house from someone else and the money went back in the bank (or another bank.. into the banking system). So, the bank has the $2MM to lend back out to someone else now (I'm ignoring the reserve ratio restriction here to make things simple.. also, the bank is paying some small amount for deposits but its less than 1% these days so I ignored it)
Yes, working people deposit money into banks. Then the banks loan it out. That process creates "more money" because it is not how much money there is, it is how easy it is to access that determines prices.
For example, if I could borrow any car any time I wanted, the value of a car wouldn't be very much.
When banks tighten lending, prices tend to go down. When banks get loose with lending (lending money to anyone to buy a house), prices tend to go up.
However, banking has always existed and will always exist. It isn't a government creation.
On your last question.. if everyone took a loan in Euros, changed it to USD, and then shorted Euros with USD as collateral...
what you are saying is...
let's say someone takes a $10 loan in Euros, converts to $10 USD and then takes another loan of $10 in Euros (because shorting is borrowing something and selling it) and then sells the borrowed $10 in Euros.
At the end, they have loans of $20 in Euros they have to pay back, $10 in USD and $10 in Euros.
The dollar would go up in value because there was a purchase of USD from Euros. The Euro would go down in value because there was a sale of Euros.
To unwind the position, you'd need to sell USD for Euros so USD would go down and you'd need to buy Euros with the result to pay off the $20 Euro you owe, so the Euro would go up.
The two cancel each other (any transaction like that has to net out).
In the US, deposits are supposed to experience very mild inflation. Because currency isn't an investment. Many people buy homes and are net short the dollar. They borrowed dollars and bought an asset, a house. They hope those dollars go down in value relative to home prices over time. If a currency's value went up over time, nobody would invest their money in anything so we are all happy the system is the way it is.

Nobody holds money. Money isn't an investment.
Rich people don't have money. Poor people don't have money.
People have:
their salary
Money doesn't "trickle down" because money is a price. It is not an asset. People use money to exchange things. Nobody "buys money". I have $20 in my wallet. That's my money. I have my house, cars, other real estate, stocks (private/public equity), bonds, etc. None of that is money. It is all priced in dollars. That is the difference between a currency (what things are priced in) and an asset (what is priced).
Inflation doesn't erode the price of anything I have except the $20 in my wallet. And I have a mortgage, so I am actually negative dollars. I spent dollars I don't have. If inflation goes up, I am happy, since I have a net short dollar position. Just like most people (although they may have not spent the dollars they borrowed on an appreciating asset).

It is a scale for you if you price the various things you buy and sell in BTC.
And if you did, you would see the Bitcoin experienced an inflation rate of over 100% since last December and it fell into hyperinflation during that time under this definition:
*"Hyperinflation occurs when the inflation rate exceeds 50% for a period of a month."*
But it isn't a scale for anyone else unless they price things in BTC.
Just like how the USD is the scale in the US and the Euro is the scale in Europe.
Right now, nobody uses BTC as a price. Every shop that takes Bitcoin prices things in dollars (in the U.S.)
For example, Overstock prices everything in dollars and when you go to check out, you have the option of paying in Bitcoin. But the price is dollars.

Yes, they get their deposits back just fine. That is how banking works...unless everyone wants their deposits back right now. If that happens, there is a "run on the bank" as shown here:
Before there was a lender of last resort, the Fed, banks could experience a run on the bank. That's what happened during the Great Depression. Today, banks can borrow from the Fed in an emergency (a run on the bank) and then as lenders pay back their money, the bank can pay back the Fed. It is a temporary measure. That's what happened in 2008/2009 in the U.S. The banks were loaned money by the Fed as home loans went bad (the bank loaned out money and people defaulted on the loans and the banks ended up with the collateral - their house) and later on, as everything worked out, the banks paid those loans back.
In my bitcoin example, everything works fine as long as the people I lent money to pay back the loans. Then the depositors can get their money. It's all good. In reality, interest is charged on loans and interest is paid to attract deposits. And the bank takes the spread between the two. If I just loan out money at 0%, I'm not going to make an money myself.
And you are EXACTLY correct. People deposit "not to give me the ability to play a dangerous lending game". Would you trust me with your money? Probably not.
You'd want someone to make sure I wasn't lending stupidly. If I'm stupid with lending, I can lose the money. And so banks are regulated. The government can go in and shut them do if they make stupid loans. Like this:
And that's the reasons the government restricts banks lending by enforcing a reserve ratio. And it's the reason we have FDIC insurance for depositors. Banks pay into the FDIC insurance fund.
In the end, to operate a bank, you have to make smart loans that will get paid back, at an interest rate high enough to make up for defaults and you have to pay an interest rate to depositors so you can attract deposits. You take the spread between the two.
Banks lend money to buy homes (mortgages), they loan students money to pay for college (student loans), they have credit cards, personal loans, corporate loans, etc.
And that's how banks create money by loaning it out. And the U.S. and other countries have all sorts of restrictions on banks, the reserve ratio is one of them, to make sure people don't lose their money. You don't have to follow those restrictions. You can create a bank without any of them. But good luck getting depositors to give you their money and if you make bad loans or have a run on the bank, there's no Fed to bail you out.

All signs point to an inevitability that one miner will have &gt; 50% of the hashing power. And once that happens, they have an incentive to mine their own chain and orphan everyone else's mined blocks. That would kick the other miners out of the game. Anyone else trying to mine blocks would get no reward and no transaction fees.
The system would continue to operate normally and user's probably wouldn't care since they wouldn't be affected at all.

If you loan me 10 bitcoin (deposit it with me), I can create up to 10000000X+ bitcoin to loan out.
I loan the 10 to Person 1
They pay the 10 to buy something from Person 2
Person 2 gives me the 10 to keep their wallet safe
I loan the 10 to Person 3
They pay the 10 to buy something from Person 4
Person 4 gives me the 10 to keep their wallet safe
I loan the 10 to Person 5
From 10 bitcoin, at the end of the above:
you have 10 bitcoin on deposit with me
Person 2 has 10 bitcoin on deposit with me
Person 4 has 10 bitcoin on deposit with me
Person 5 has 10 bitcoin to spend
I could loan all 10 out because there's no reserve ratio I need to maintain.
If the $10 was dollars (a $10 deposit), a bank couldn't loan all $10 out because they are restricted by the reserve ratio they must maintain according to banking regulations.

If you have &gt; 50% of the hashing power, you will always be able to mine a chain longer than the main chain, no matter where you start.
Imagine you have two people. One can run 5mph and the others can run 4mph. No matter how far back the 5mph runner starts, he will eventually overtake all 4mph runners.
Similarly, a &gt; 50% miner who simply mines their own chain, privately, will overtake the main chain eventually and can orphan all the blocks from where they started.
The network would not reject those blocks automatically. The developers could go and change the checkpoints in the code to reject that chain. But that's the central control everyone doesn't want. And how would they know which chain to reject? The &gt; 50% miner could cause double spends on both chains.
The result of all that is nobody would change anything as long as it was just a theft of $100 million from one exchange. Take a look at Bitcoin Gold. It hasn't changed much even though it was double spent. It is pretty much tracking Bitcoins price even after the double spend. Nobody cares.

USD is an exact scale just like Celsius. It is how we price things. That is why bitcoin is priced in dollars (and so is everything else in the U.S.)
The wealth of the United States and the people of the United States is not in dollars. There are almost zero dollars compared to the assets people own. People own businesses, stock in companies, real estate, commodities, cars, clothes, sheep, patents, loans.. beanie babies, bltcoins.. a nearly infinite number of things.
Those are priced in dollars, they are not dollars.
When you look at Bill Gates, is his major holding dollars? Does he have "billions of dollars" in a drawer somewhere? No. He has billions in assets that are priced in dollars.
The dollars I have are what is in my wallet. They earn zero interest and they come and go. They are a means of exchange. I don't keep the dollars in my wallet forever. They are ephemeral.
The world benefits by more spending on good things. Loans by themselves can be good or bad. Government debt can be good or bad. It all depends on what it is spent on.
If I borrow $100 to buy a lawn mower to start a lawn mowing business that makes money, that's a good use of debt.
If I borrow $100 to spend on crack, that's a bad use of debt.
So, although I agree in general that more saving/holding is a good idea for a lot of people, more spending is good for people that use the money to do good stuff with the spending.

Banks always existed because banking started with things like gold.
This is history. When gold was used for money, people didn't want to keep their gold in their house because they were worried about getting robbed. So, they kept their money with the goldsmith. The goldsmith had lots of security because he had lots of gold.
The goldsmith would charge people to put gold on deposit with him. The goldsmith wouldn't lend it out.
One goldsmith got smart and said, guys.. I'll let you store gold for free with me if you let me lend some of it out with interest. I'll get collateral for the loans, if someone is buying a house and I loan them a bunch of gold to buy it and they default, I get their house.
People could then deposit their money for free with the goldsmith. Another goldsmith said, hey deposit your gold with me and I'll pay you interest. I'll make money loaning the gold out.
Now people could borrow gold at 10% and get paid 5% to deposit it with the goldsmith.
And the goldsmith could loan out gold, the person would buy a house or whatever from someone else, and that gold would go back to the goldsmith on deposit.
The goldsmith could just keep track of who had what gold so they didn't even need to carry gold around. They could just keep around a note saying they had this much on deposit with the goldsmith and the goldsmith would maintain a ledger of who had what.
The goldsmith created gold by lending and relending the same gold. And if everyone made their loan payments, it was all good. They made their loan payments by working. They'd work, get paid in gold and use that to repay the goldsmith. The goldsmith would keep enough gold on hand to deal with people's withdrawls to buy stuff.
If someone defaulted on the loan, he'd get their collateral and sell it. And if someone just ran off with their gold and had no collateral, he'd need to make it up out of the interest spread he had.
That's what actually happened historically. And it is what always happens. Banking isn't a government creation. It has always existed and will always exist because people want to borrow money and people want to deposit their money somewhere safe.
Even with bitcoin people deposit their money somewhere safe. Xapo takes bitcoin and stores the key in vaults for people who have are scared their private key is going to get lost.

A hardfork is generally known to be a change to the bitcoin protocol which is incompatible with the previous protocol so everyone needs to update their software and any blocks mined with the old software will be rejected by the network. After a hardfork, you need to update your software to be compatible with the new protocol or things won't work properly.
A private blockchain is simply an unpublished blockchain. All blocks are mined in private and then published.
In bitcoin, the longest chain wins (chain with the most work, technically which is generally the longest chain)
If you mine a block and publish it and someone else mines the same block and publishes it, there are two competing chains in the network. Both actually exist at that point. Transactions in both blocks are valid in both of those chains.
Miners then pick one of those 2 competing blocks to mine from and someone mines another block on top of one or the other. The one thatdidn't get a block mined on top of it is not the longest chain and is orphaned. The transactions in the orphaned block are gone and the block reward that was given the miner because they mined that orphaned block is gone.
And miners continue mining from the longest chain. However, there is no reason they have to. Miners can mine a block, not publish it, and then mine another block on top of that and then publish both blocks at once. The reason they don't right now is because if they don't have &gt; 50% of the hashing power, they won't make a chain longer than the rest of the network and by the time they publish their 2 blocks, the other chain will be ahead of theirs so both their blocks will simply be orphaned.
I really don't see why anyone would care if a miner did a double spend in the Bitcoin network. Why would a normal user care? They didn't lose anything. And you'd never find out who did it just like nobody is going to find out who double spent Bitcoin Gold. Bitcoin Gold is just a fork of Bitcoin. Same code, same rules. All that is different is the hash power required to do a &gt; 50% double spend is smaller.

If a bank is lent $10 (someone deposits $10) and the fractional reserve they must maintain is 10%, they can only lend out $9.
The $9 is lent out. Then the person who got the $9 buys something from someone else (dollars are used to pay for things... salary, cars, houses, etc.) and the other person puts the money in the bank. Nobody holds $100,000 in their wallet.
Once the $9 is back in the bank, the bank can loan out $8.10 (keeps 10% to maintain the required reserve ratio). That $9 goes out and can come back and so on.
If the bank didn't need to maintain a reserve ratio, it could lend out the $10 over and over again as it gets the $10 back over and over again.
A bank can't have a deposit of $10 and then "create $100". Banks aren't magic. They can only lend out money they have. Their lending creates money as I showed above where I turned 10 bitcoin into 40 bitcoin.
If you don't understand this explanation, you can watch this. It is only 1 minute:
That is how the system works. You can do the same thing a bank does if you can convince people to deposit money with you. However, you have no requirement to operate under a fractional reserve ratio. You can lend out all the money you get. A 0% fractional reserve ratio. You can do the same thing with bitcoin as per my example above.
If you make poor lending decisions, you can lose everyone's money, of course. That's why you better charge interest when you lend, enough to cover the losses from anyone who doesn't pay you back.
And no, I do not have a poor understanding of fractional reserve banking. I manage quite a lot of money and have to deal with all this stuff all the time. The fractional reserve isn't something that is "given" to banks, it is a restriction banks operate under. They are OK operating under those restrictions because they get something for it. FDIC insurance, the ability to borrow from the Fed as a lender of last resort, etc.
Think of it this way, if a bank had no fractional reserve ratio, it could lend out all the money it had on deposit. That wouldn't be very safe, would it. If a bank had a 100% reserve ratio, it couldn't lend out at all. If $100 was deposited, it would need to keep all $100 in reserve.

Yes that is fine. The dollar is not an asset, it is a currency. Nobody buys a dollar, it is what we use to exchange things.
Your graph shows that prices of homes, salaries and cars went up over time. That's great. 
Meanwhile a dollar is still worth a dollar. I don't know why bitcoiners are always trying to compare the price of an asset.. against it's price.
It's like boiling water and graphing the temperature value in Celsius and then saying that Celsius "went down" and the boiling water "went up".
The dollar is a price. It is not an asset. It is the thing we exchange goods and services with. How many dollars do you have? I have about $20 in my wallet but I have millions in assets. Those assets are not dollars. I hope they go up in price over time. It would be pretty shitty if they didn't.
If my assets constantly went down in price, I'd sell them and hold currency. And so would everyone else. And everyone would get fired because people could buy more things every year by just holding dollars. A small bit of inflation is perfect and allows ordinary people to become wealthy.

For the USD, you are using M2. M2 is not cash and is not dollars. Specifically: "M2 is a broader money classification than M1, because it includes assets that are highly liquid but are not cash", You shouldn't even be using M1, you should use M0. And you probably know that.
Using M2 is like including exchange deposits with Bitcoin in calculating its "inflation". You'll get way higher inflation than 10% if you do that. Try comparing similar things next time. I know you didn't want to because Bitcoin's inflation is higher than the USD dollar right now but come on.
And if you really wanted to be fair, you'd include all the Bitcoin forks in its inflation rate. After all, everyone who owned bitcoin got coins on those forks and those have new coins that can be mined. If you use that metric, Bitcoin's inflation has been more than 50% annually, easily.

No, I can't really see how any system could work better? People work, they get paid and they go out and buy things. And those transactions are all effortless. Nobody has to worry about the money disappearing or the value going down during the transaction. There are lots of things people can invest in for their retirement. Anyone can buy real estate, stock, bonds, commodities if they have the money. And to get money, they can work.

I use my credit card for everything. I was out buying something today, I put my credit card near the reader (it is contactless) and the transaction was done immediately. I got the credit card for free. I get 3% cash back on my purchases. The bank loans me the money to make all my purchases (that's the "credit" in credit card).

Let's say there was only 1 bitcoin. You gave it to an exchange, to put it in your account. The exchange lends it out to someone else, call that person A. Then A buys something from B with the 1 bitcoin. B puts the money into the exchange, in their account. The exchange takes the 1 bitcoin and lends it out to C. C buys something from D. D puts it back into the exchange. The exchange lends it out to E. E buys something from F. F puts the money in the exchange.
At the end:- You, B, D and F have deposits of 1 bitcoin in the exchange
\- A, C, E owe the exchange 1 bitcoin
\- the exchange has 1 bitcoin to lend out
Since there is no fractional reserve limiting what lending the exchange can do, it can lend out all the bitcoins it wants. How many bitcoins exist in the above example? 4 people have 1 bitcoin on deposit in the bank and the bank has 1 bitcoin. There's 5 bitcoins out there. Where did they come from? That's how money is "created out of thin air". It is created from lending.

Nobody has their retirement money in cash. You do realize that, don't you? They have assets that increase in price over time. Real estate, stocks, bonds, private equity, commodities, etc.
Those things go up in value over time. And what is that called? Inflation. And that's why if you have retirement "money" (assets), you are happy to have a little inflation. Look at the richest people in the world. Do they have their money in cash under their mattress?
Cash is a medium of exchange, it is not an investment. And that is why everyone is happy with a little inflation because we want what we own to go up in price over time.

For some reason, some people think a fractional reserve is magic.
I have $10. I loan a friend A $10, friend A buys something from friend B, friend B gives me the $10 for safe keeping. I loan out $8 of it to friend C. I'm now a bank with a 20% fractional reserve.
Only $10 exists. I have $10 on deposit from friend B. I've loaned out $18. Friend A owed me $10. Friend C owes me $8. How much money is "in the economy"?
$20. I have $2. Friend B has $10 on deposit with me. Friend C has $8 to spend right now. $10 was "created out of thin air"

The fractional reserve is a restriction on banking. It is not something that banking is given.
Without a fractional reserve, a bank could lend out 100% of its deposits.
Exchanges in bitcoin can do the same thing now. Take people's bitcoin and lend it out. The people you lend it to buy something and those people put it back in the exchange. Now you lend out the same coins again. You can have 10 bitcoins and lend them out over and over, getting them back in deposit over and over. That's how money is "created out of thin air"
The fractional reserve says a bank can't lend out all the money they have on deposit. They have to keep a fraction in reserve. It is a restriction on banks that limits what they can do.

Every time the price halves, the block reward the miners get in dollar terms halves. And every time the block reward drops, the miners don't want to lose money so they only allow in transactions that pay a higher fee.
So, as it halves, fees go up. 5 million a day is probably close to the combined running cost of all the mining farms. That money needs to come from somewhere or they will shut down.
Right now, with the price dropping, many mining farms will shut down. The remaining mining farms will need higher fees to continue operating.
And when the block reward hits zero, the miners need to make up all their costs with fees. So, that 5 million a day needs to come from users transactions.

Banks derivative exposure is hedged. Their objective is to maintain a risk neutral position. For every position they have things go one way, they have another position the other way to cancel it. Banks make money on spreads. I worked on wall street on the software that kept one of their markets risk neutral. If you just add up their total possible exposure to everything you end up with a big number, but if you see the bets cancel each other, you see they are risk neutral.
Much like if you have a $100 bet that a stock will go up and another $100 bet that the same stock will stay the same or go down. Your total bet is $200 (total exposure) but your risk is nothing (you are subject to counter party risk but that's another story).

When you "own" bitcoin, you have the ability to move a number in a ledger... if the developers and miners let you. If the developers decide your transaction should be blacklisted, the source can be modified to blacklist the funding transaction with one line of code. If the miners decide they don't want to process any transaction from your account, they can prevent any transaction from being processed by simply never adding it to a block or by orphaning other blocks that include your account (in the case of a miner controlling &gt; 50% of the hashing power).
If the funding transaction that gave you bitcoin is part of a chain that is orphaned, you lose your coins. This could happen if your coins originated from a mining reward and another miner mines the block that generated the reward, claiming the reward for themselves. In that case, your funding transaction is gone forever.
That is the situation that BCH ABC sits in right now. If a miner gets a reward and spends it and 10 blocks pass and another miner, with &gt; 50% of the hashing power, builds up a chain 11 long in secret and publishes to orphan the last 10 blocks, then anyone who received a funding transaction that originated from the orphaned block reward is SOL.

No, the dollar is not a pyramid scheme. The dollar is not an investment or a gamble. Nobody "buys the dollar". We use the dollar as a medium of exchange. We sell something for dollars and then buy something else for dollars. For example, we sell our skill set/work for dollars (get a salary) and buy a car with it. Dollars is what we price those things in.
We don't 'hodl' dollars. Look at the richest people in the U.S. How many dollars do they have? Basically none. Just like me, they have: stock, bonds, real estate, commodities, etc. Those are priced in dollars, they are not dollars.
You don't "buy a dollar" hoping to sell it to a higher price to someone else.

If one entity has enough hash power (&gt; 50% assures it), they can roll back transactions on the main chain and make a longer chain with more work, erasing transactions on the main chain. If they roll the chain back before the transaction that put value into your account key, your account is emptied. Your key = your key but whether that key contains a value in the chain is up to whoever contains the chain (developers and majority hash power miners).

The example I gave is exactly how banking works. It is banking. Exactly.
Banks take deposits and lend them out. Banks can also take out loans (from other banks) and lend that out.
In my example, I took deposits and lent them out. I operated under a fractional reserve ratio of 0%. Banks operate under a fractional reserve ratio of 10% because they are regulated. If they lend out more than 90%, they will be shut down by the regulators.
Banks are fine with being regulated because then they get to access the Fed (lender of last resort), the FHLB (so they can borrow money to lend out mortgages) and are part of the FDIC insurance system, etc.
Lending is how money is created. I created money "out of thin air" above. When I had $100 on deposit (someone gave it to me for safe keeping) and then I lent the $100 out, 2 people had $100 not one.
One person had their $100 with me for safe keeping, the other borrowed it to buy something. When they bought something from someone else and that other person put the money back on deposit (gave me the money for safe keeping). I had $100 in my pocket, two people had $100 in the bank (me) and one person owed me $100.
If one of the two people wanted part of their $100 back to spend, I could give me them part of the $100 in my pocket. However, both people who had $100 on deposit with me couldn't get their $100 out at the same time. That is known as a "run on the bank".
That is how banking works
@_date: 2018-11-22 06:49:16
When you buy something with a credit card, you are not buying with your money. The bank is loaning you the money to make the purchase. It is not like giving someone your private address, it is like giving someone nothing. The bank pays the bill to the vendor, you don't. At the end of the month, you have the option to pay your loan off or let it roll by paying a small amount and an interest rate for the loan. If you pay the loan off at the end of the month, it was a zero interest loan. Debit cards work differently. In the US, by law, if your credit card number is used fraudulently, you are not liable for the charges.
If you bill a ton on your credit card and don't ever pay the bill and declare bankruptcy, the bank loses that money, forever. That isn't that uncommon.

The double spend transaction would not appear on the main chain. The transaction that sent the coins to you is on an orphaned chain nobody cares about.
Now, let's say you did tell the world that someone double spent coins. And that, in fact, that person could double spend at will.
At that point would the system be useful at all? Would anyone trust any transaction?
But that's how it is designed and how it works now. The system is designed so someone can double spend once they have &gt; 50% hash power.
And you trust it anyway. So, given that's the way it works, would you quit using it if some other transaction was double spent? Would you care at all? Who cares as long as you aren't the one affected. 
Here's the list of orphaned blocks right now. The transactions in those blocks were invalidated. You can contact them and have them complain that their transactions were thrown out when the blocks were orphaned. See how much reaction you get:

One single entity has controlled &gt; 50% of the has power (and by the way, it isn't a 51% attack, it is a 50% attack, the people who say 51% are simply wrong) multiple times in the past and it didn't trigger any short orders.
The length of attack is not ephemeral at all. You currently have no idea who has&gt; 50% of the hash rate. Nobody knows who is mining what blocks, who is colluding with who and who has the most computing resources. There are only guesses based on systems that specifically identify themselves.
There are no identities kept on the bitcoin blockchain, there are only hashes of public keys. And there is no way for you to tell who controls what amount of hashing power anyone hash, you can only guess. And the devs and miners work together to make the most money for themselves possible. And that money comes from everyone who uses the network.

Bailing out banks (for the most part) meant lending them money. They paid back the money lent, it was not a give. The Fed has to operate as the lender of last resort to prevent the banking system from collapsing when a huge financial bubble pops and causes systemic risk to the whole system.
The argument against doing what was done is the same argument Andrew Mellon used during the Great Depression. He saw the collapse of the entire banking system as a good thing and it was a disaster for the economy and the country.
The best thing is to avoid the bubble in the first place, of course. But facing what they did, they did the right thing.

The 21 million limit is predicated on 2 things.
First, that the developers don't unlimit the number of bitcoins by changing the reward to a positive number instead of zero when the mining reward goes away.
Second, that no miner (or group) who has &gt; 50% of the hash power uses it to double spend their own coins which they can do with &gt; 50% of the hash power. That also effectively removes the 21 million cap.

If banks are "loaning way too easy", why don't you borrow some money from a bank and buy assets that will increase in a crash scenario? If you think money is "printed out of nothing" and will become worthless as a result, why not borrow money and buy something that will increase in value as the money becomes worthless? As cash becomes worthless, you'll be able to sell just a little bit of the asset you bought and pay off the loan you got (which, apparently, is easy to get).

Interest rates were lowered to fill the hole created by the ~2008 housing bubble. Banks had lent out money to anyone who wanted to buy a house causing housing prices to skyrocket. Inflation in home prices (home prices increase, dollar is worth less in terms of homes) was the result of easy lending.
When the bubble popped, it caused overall deflation (home prices decrease, dollar is worth more in terms of homes) and severe credit tightening.
Lower interest rates were put it to try and get things back to a state where they were before the bubble.. but not too create a new bubble. It isn't an easy calculation to make. The Fed halted QE last year.
From here on out, it is anyone's guess. But it isn't clear what it is one way or the other. What was done in response to the real estate bubble collapse was correct.

When you purchase bitcoin, you are buying an entry in a distributed ledger. It is worth what someone will pay you for it. The developers have control over whether your address can transact (they can put in code to blackhole your address), whether your entry exists (they can erase the chain by checkpointing a different chain before your funding transaction), what your transactions fees will be if you want to spend and how many bitcoins overall there are and how fast they are printed (fixing the block reward to &gt; 0 unlimits the number of bitcoins).
Similarly, a miner or group with &gt; 50% of the mining power can block transactions from your address or roll the chain back to before your funding transaction causing you to lose your coins unless the developers put hardcoded checkpoints in the code (the other central authority) to prevent them from doing so.
So, you own a hope and a dream. It is not money. Money is a price of things, not an investment. In the US, we use dollars to exchange things. We exchange our work for cars, homes, stocks, bonds, etc. using dollars. None of those are money, money/cash is a price and a medium of exchange. You can't graph the "value of money" against asset prices because money/cash/dollars are prices themselves, they are not assets. Bitcoin is an invisible asset that has no underlying value. Bitcoin is priced in dollars (dollars is a price, no an asset).

If you want to "get away from the central banks" and don't want to hold cash, get a mortgage and buy a house. That is shorting cash and buying an asset. You hope the value of cash will go down in the future against your real estate asset (your house).
Nobody holds cash. People keep their money in stocks, bonds, real estate, commodities, etc. We use cash to transact. I work (that isn't cash), I get paid and I go buy something with the cash I'm paid. I take extra money and buy stock with it. A couple weeks after I am paid cash for my salary, I have no cash as I have converted it all into other asset classes. Nobody holds cash for more than a little time. If you are, you are doing something wrong as cash pays no interest.

If I run a node out of my house and someone passes me a solved block and I publish it, there is absolutely no way you can trace that block back to me, much less the miner who actually solved it. Identities of miners are not kept on the blockchain. All you have is my public key that I just created 10 seconds ago. I never have to use the key again, either.

Let's say I have address A that has 50 bitcoins and I have &gt; 50% of hash power.
I make a transaction sending 50 bitcoins from A to you (B). Then you send the cocaine or meth in the mail I just bought. Then I remine that block, erasing my transaction from A to B (poof, it never happened) and then send 50 bitcoins from A to (C) to get cocaine and meth from them as well.
I can create as many coins as I want because I have the ability to create and destroy coins by orphaning blocks.
Now, you may say "well, I'll just wait until 10 blocks are mined before I say you really transferred the money"
Ok, so now I send my 50 bitcoins from A (me) to B (you). Then I keep mining my own chain and the rest of the network merrily mines along their chain. In 10 blocks, you send the cocaine I bought on the dark market.
Then I go and replace the whole chain with the chain I was mining. It has the same transactions as the chain mined by the other half of the network but it is missing one transaction, my A to B transfer. You no longer have 50 coins on the chain, they are back with me, that transfer never happened. Then I make a new transaction sending my 50 coins from A to C.
Now change the 50 to 5,000 or 5,000,000. WIth &gt; 50% hashing power, I own the chain. I can send coins from my account, make them disappear and resend them as many times as I want. The number of coins I can do this with is unlimited.

If mining starts to become unprofitable, the big 3 miners will get together and mine their own chain, orphaning everyone else's blocks (selfish mining). The alternative is for them to go out of business. This kicks everyone else out of the mining game as it makes it completely unprofitable to mine at all. Without competition, they are able to regulate transaction fees and block processing.
They also get the power to block transactions they don't want and accelerate transactions that people pay extra for (the payment for acceleration already happens today). The token community won't care because their transactions are being processed and, in fact, they will see it as a good thing because the centralization stabilizes the network. The developers are centralized now anyway, there never has really been decentralization. The developers have always been able to block addresses, fork the chain, etc.

Someone sold you a virtual token for money. That virtual token represents nothing at all. It is not ownership in a company, it is not a debt payment that needs to be repaid at some point, it is not a proxy for a commodity.
Why do you call that an "investment"? You are now wondering why that virtual token, which has no underlying value, is going down in price.
It costs nothing for someone to make a virtual token. The people who made them and continue to make them are making lots of actual money selling them. The people brokering them are making lots of actual money.
The people buying them are losing actual money the second they buy them. They are paying real money for nothing.
That's how I see it and how a lot of other people see it. I am not trying to be snarky here or ruin someone's dreams. Many of us simply can't understand why anyone would ever buy a number from a list someone else made. There's nothing there.
And if you want to talk about the "value of the dollar", I'll add that that dollar is a number we price things in. It is not an investment. Nobody "invests" in the dollar. Nobody says "I just invested in 100 dollars". Currencies are not an investment, they are a price.

Which do you think is more efficient
1. keeping a copy of the key on 2 or 3 SQL servers synced in 2 or 3 locations and that are load balanced so if one goes down, you go to another one. SQL servers that are fully indexed and supported with a full SQL language OR
2. a giant linked list with no index with no query language that is copied to 10000 ledgers in 10000 locations and that requires you to solve useless compute intensive math problems to make changes to the list.
The SQL servers can do 10000 transactions a second. The giant linked list, not so much.

Approximately $7 million in new bitcoin will be created today by mining reward fees. This is an annual inflation rate of 3.85%. United States inflation is currently around 2.5%.
Bitcoin's transaction fees will skyrocket after the mining reward drops. As it nears zero, Bitcoin will be modified to put in a fixed mining reward (one line change in the code), giving it permanent inflation and unlimiting the number of bitcoins. The system will simply not work otherwise because the transaction fees will be too high.

Speculation was the whole point of the whitepaper and system (along with supporting smuggling). Read the comment history of the source on sourceforge and the crypto newsgroup at the time.
@_date: 2018-12-13 22:05:10
There is no way miners will continue to run operations when the block reward goes to zero if transaction fees don't skyrocket. Mining rewards bring in $6MM a day these days.
There are just over 250,000 transactions today and the total transaction revenue per day now is $80,000. So, your average transaction has fee of $0.32 right now.
If mining rewards went away, transactions fees would need to be $0.32 + (6MM/250K) = $0.32 + $24 = $24.32 to match what it is today with mining rewards.
Are you willing to pay close to $25 per transaction? If not, do you want the miners to start shutting down because if they do and the hash power isn't kept high, the system will be not only be susceptible to double spends but there will be 10s, 100s or 1000s of chain splits.
So, you better keep paying the miners to "keep the network secure". If you can't get that from transaction fees, how are you going to do it?
The obvious solution is to keep the block reward where it is today. Permanent 3.8% inflation per year (new bitcoins given to miners). Users are happy, miners are happy, everyone is happy. The number of bitcoins becomes unlimited.
It is inevitable that will happen because otherwise the system doesn't work. It has worked so far because the inflation rate has always been higher than the US dollar. The system simply can't work without either &gt; $20 transaction fees or permanent inflation. If it can, tell me how it can. It is a one line change to the bitcoin source to fix the block reward and that creates permanent inflation and unlimits the number of bitcoins.
@_date: 2018-12-13 06:53:13

The US will NEVER default on its debt unless it just "feels like it". US debt is in dollars and it can simply print dollars to pay off the debt. It likely wouldn't even cause inflation as then the country would have zero debt after the payoff and they would just be converting interest bearing instruments for non-interest bearing (Treasuries &lt;-&gt; dollars).
A country defaulting on debt is a problem only when their debt is in the currency of another country. Developing countries have debt in US dollars, for example. Eurozone countries (like Greece) have debt in Euros. Their debt is not in currency they control (Greece borrows from the ECB), that is why those countries can default on their debt.
The US debt is in dollars. It can't default on its debt unless the government "just feels like it".

your private keys have no value. theoretical value is contained in the distributed ledger. If your public key hash is wiped from the distributed ledger, your private key represents nothing. and that ledger is under the control of 2 other parties. first, the developers who can change the rules of the game to whatever they want. if they didn't want you to have your coins, they could fork and erase your transactions, as they did in bitcoin 2010 when someone exploited an overflow condition. as the ETH developers did with the DAO.
And then there are the miners. They can make you pay $100000 to perform a transaction if a group with &gt; 50% of the hashing power decides it. They can block transactions from your address completely, making your private key worthless.
Your private key has no value. It is a key that unlocks a safe that someone else is keeping. And they can do what they want with that safe. they have full control over it. They can fractional reserve it if they want. They can loan your coins out and prevent you from touching them or just take them away.

(gold isn't controlled by some random developers who can fork it or erase your ownership), will take over cash! (never), is limited to 21 million coins (ignore the fact the devs will make a 1 line change to remove that limit), decentralized (devs and miners are both central control), be your own bank (your coins aren't in your possession, they are on a ledger you don't control), anonymous! (good luck turning them into cash), the coins can't be taken from you! (endless hacks), banksters are all corrupt and just print money! (point me to which richest people in the world are "banksters"), look at the value of the dollar! (the dollar is a price, like a kilogram, it doesn't make sense to graph an asset value against its price - the dollar)...

The ledger nano S is secure unless someone puts a fake one in the box that generates a private key known by the attacker. Or they could just put a chip in between the device and LCD that caused a different private key to appear on the display. They could intercept it in transit if you bought from a known source. But don't worry about it, the chances of that happening are small. Not zero but small. A dev who worked at ledger could cause the device to spit out a known private key randomly too. But odds of that are small.
You are your own bank so if you lose all your money, it is your fault. No FDIC insurance, no way to get it back. So, don't screw it up like everyone else did.

Of course it can be changed. It is literally a one line change to the source code. Miners would be happy with a change to the block reward to fix it at the current number. Users would be happy with the low transaction fees. Everyone is happy. It is what will happen anyway, it is in everyone's interest to unlimit the number of bitcoins.

Are you saying a dollar was one worth .0002857 dollars? So a dollar was worth less than a dollar?
You do realize that makes no sense, right? A dollar is a price and not an asset.
You can't graph "the value of the dollar" over time because the dollar is a price. People don't have dollars. They have real estate, stock, bonds, commodities, personal property including shoes, bags, furniture, etc. They have a skill set that has a price in dollars (that is a "salary"). All those are priced in dollars and we use the dollar to exchange one thing for another. We don't "buy dollars". We don't "invest in dollars".
If I got paid $10 an hour 10 years ago and a pair of shoes was $10, I had to work an hour to buy a pair of shoes. If I get paid $20 an hour today and a pair of shoes costs $20, I work an hour to buy a pair of shoes. If my skill set is outdated, I would get paid less. If my skill set was in demand, I'd get paid more.
When I got paid $10 an hour 10 years ago and when I get paid $20 an hour today, does that mean the dollar is worth less? It means my skill set pays more. And if takes more dollars to buy a pair of shoes, shoes have gone up in price as well. The dollar is a price. 10 years ago, the dollar was a dollar and today it is the same.
Bitcoin is not a price. Bitcoin is priced in dollars. Bitcoin is not a currency in any country.

No miner is going to accept code that reduces the block reward. They'd be happy to accept one that increased the block reward. And that is what will happen anyway when the block reward halves again because users won't want to pay ridiculous transaction fees.
The miners will end up with a block reward that is fixed and the number of bitcoins will be unlimited in the end. It will have permanent 3% inflation or so. The alternative is to have crazy transaction fees. Nobody cares that the number of bitcoins is unlimited, all they care is that the system continues to work and their coins don't go worthless.

Your bitcoin wallet has keys in it. It doesn't have any money in it. Your bitcoin wallet is not the record of coins on the ledger. The ledger is distributed on computers around the world. Without a miner to process a transaction from your hashed key in the ledger, you can't make a transaction and your private key is completely worthless. The developers can change the code arbitrarily to prevent spends from your hashed address, unlimit the number of bitcoins or screw the system up so badly, nobody wants to use it.
The value of your private keys is entirely in the hands of others. If you owned gold, you'd own a physical thing that is an element in the periodic table of elements. Nobody has found a way to make more gold easily without digging in the ground, fusion is impractical. So, when you own gold, you own something that someone else can't take from you unless they physically come and take it from you. When you own bitcoin, the thing you have of value can be taken from you by other parties because it is not fully in your control. It like having gold that someone else is holding for you in a safe. You have the key to the safe but you don't maintain ownership.

Other countries love dollars because the government and banks work together to manage the US dollar well (open market operations, lender of last resort, etc.). Additionally, the US has a solid legal system, best military, huge economy and the leaders are democratically elected. The FED is a public/private institution. The profits the Fed make go to the Treasury (US government). And, because of that, bankers aren't "the rich" in the U.S. Look at the rich list, it is comprised of people who created and run businesses, investors, etc.
When you buy bitcoin, you are putting all your trust into a totally unaccountable group of developers who can't get along. They are the central authority that can change the rules on a whim. If they couldn't there would be no forks, ETH couldn't convert to PoS, etc. And you put your trust in the miners to process transactions because without them, you can't do anything.
Unlike gold, where the gold itself is what has value, your private key has no value. It allows you to screw with a number on a ledger, and that ledger you don't control. If the devs and miners wanted to erase your ownership tomorrow, they could do it. They control the ledger, not you. They can't happen with a physical asset like gold because there is no middleman. You actually have gold in your possession (if you wish). You can never take possession of your balance on the blockchain, it is always in someone else's control.

Just FYI, the US can pay off the debt today. The debt is in dollars and the US can print dollars. So, the US can never default on its debt. Other countries can because their debt is not in their own currency. Greece, Italy, Spain can default because their debt is in Euros and they can't print Euros. They have to go to the ECB. So, the US will always be able to pay off its debt. Now you can start saying how that will cause massive inflation. But it woudln't. Why? Because the debt is already out there in the form of Treasuries. If you paid off the Treasuries with dollars, you'd be exchanging something that paid interest (the debt) to something that doesn't (dollars). The US would be better off if it did that. And the people would just want Treasuries again because they want interest (Treasures, dollars pay no interest), so you'd just get the dollars back, if you wanted them. If people didn't want US debt, they'd dump it but people love it because the dollar is well managed.

She buys a house for $2MM by getting a $1.4MM mortgage after saving $600,000.

After her mortgage, she is then short dollars (she has borrowed dollars and spent the borrowed dollars on an asset). As she gets paid, she puts money in stocks, bonds, commodities and pays off her house. Her salary goes up. She ends up pretty wealthy.
How many dollars did she "invest in"? None. She was short the dollar when she got her mortgage. When she is done paying off the mortgage, she has real estate, stock, bonds and commodities. She never "invested in the dollar". The dollar is a price and is used to make transactions, it is not an investment.

1. You can't make a bitcoin transaction with anyone, even with yourself, without going through an intermediary. Specifically, 4 miners own the majority hash power and a miner with a large computer farm needs to approve your transaction.
2. It will cost you money to transact because miners don't process transactions for free. There is no fee to pay someone with a paper dollar. There is no fee to give someone a gold coin.
3. Unlike gold or paper dollars in your wallet, you don't maintain the ownership of your bitcoins. Your bitcoin ownership is sitting in a distributed ledger. Your keys allow you to transfer those coins if miners approve the transfer. Nobody needs to approve a transfer of gold or paper dollars.
4. Bitcoin developers can change the code to unlimit the number of bitcoins, change the protocol, block your address, put in a checkpoint to switch the blockchain to a different one, etc. Your coins can be erased by the developers or made worthless by the developers. And they can do it from anywhere in the world.
Unlike paper dollars in your wallet or gold in a safe, you are absolutely not in control of your money when it comes to tokens. You can't make a transaction without someone else and the rules of the system can be changed arbitrarily, without your involvement.

Wait, this said a HOLDer buys. So, they aren't a HOLDer, they are a BUYer.
So, shouldn't it say BUYer?
Are you asking me to carry your bags to your room, sir?

so you are saying these tokens are useful because people can use them for illegal transactions. you do realize that no drug dealer wants tokens, they want cash. how are they going to launder the money? Do you think governments will allow token&lt;-&gt;cash conversion if all the transactions are illegal?

Nope, nobody made bitcoin out of thin air. It's a real thing. It isn't just some computer code that creates a distributed ledger that is now managed by 4 Chinese firms. I'm very misinformed, I guess. And this computer code, it can never be changed (even though it is on a regular basis). Hey, did you see the video where one of the devs said that if a miner got &gt; 50% of the hashing power and made the longest chain, the devs would change the hashing algorithm and fork the chain to remove/orphan the blocks he solved? Totally decentralized.

Bitcoin curently has an inflation rate almost double of the US dollar. When mining rewards go to zero for Bitcoin, one of two things will happen. Either transaction fees will go exponential because miners need to get paid or the mining reward will be put back. As users won't pay high transaction fees, the mining reward will be forced back or the system will fail. Bitcoin will have 3% inflation forever and the number of bitcoins will be unlimited (one line change to the source code to fix the block reward). 
It is inevitable. If it isn't and you think that the number of bitcoins won't continue to increase forever, explain how transactions will be processed by miners when the reward is zero if transaction fees aren't 100X what they are today (or more).

Not his coins.

You are buying a number in a file that is managed by a small group of developers that can't get along and a few Chinese miners. The devs can make more numbers if they want and you can't send numbers to someone else without paying a Chinese miner. The underlying value of the number is zero, it is completely worthless.

Dude, the Fed has been quantitative tightening for a while now, taking dollars out of circulation. You have no idea what you are talking about. 
@_date: 2018-12-10 07:02:46
That's a good idea because it funds the lifestyle of the people who started "printing" these coins in 2009. You keep paying them the money you earn and then you end up dying with nothing to show for your life. That really sticks it to the banksters.

I had magnetic deguassers at my last job, erases hard drives just about immediately. SSDs have a self destruct ATA command. If it is self encrypting, you just tell it to lose its internal key and that erases it instantaneously.

Here's something that will blow your mind. I get 2% to 5% back on my credit card transactions. Lots of options for cash back cards, you can see some of them here:

The Fed has been doing quantitative tightening all year. So, the answer is minus 30 billion a month right now  (they are pulling 30 billion in cash out of circulation). If you want to understand how it works:
