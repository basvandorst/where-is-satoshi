Do you have any relevant links on this proposed flaw in GoldCoin's solution or are these just your thoughts?

Is Ripple even working yet?

You only got the attention of like minded individuals until your post was ranked higher.

They put their shiny badge icons on it and everything?

Stop the gambling and maybe send some to your friends and family as a Christmas gift so they have to open accounts on Coinbase, etc. to trade for US dollars.

I can absolutely assure you that bitcoin would still be spelled bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-10-13 04:33:44
Bitcoin has the head start.  Others are starting to compete.  Apparently GoldCoin has fixed the 51% problem just today.
@_date: 2013-10-20 22:48:04
No you just don't want bitcoin to lose it's luster.   It won't, of course.  You folks do more harm than good by appearing afraid.

Imagine their surprise when he reveals:
**"I am not the Dread Pirate Roberts. My name is Ryan; I inherited Silk Road from the previous Dread Pirate Roberts, just as you will inherit it from me. The man I inherited it from is not the real Dread Pirate Roberts either. His name was Cummerbund. The real Roberts has been retired 15 years and living like a king in Patagonia."**

Boils down to philosophy vs. reality I suppose.

If you feel that way, support him in his court case.  The bottom line is he may have saved 100s of lives because buying drugs using his method didn't involve the customary gang murder, etc.  It involved real marketplace competition where consumers voted with their feet and suppliers had to respond with better products.
Don't you think the best way to fight a war on drugs is to never have the war and just sell the shit at your local pharmacy like any other drug?
Why would the DEA, etc want to lose funding though?  Shouldn't we continue with yet one more reason to tax and carry the burden of a huge nanny state?

Altcoins are fine.  These bitcoin purists are NUTS!
@_date: 2013-10-13 20:10:41
Care to defend that position or explain why it does not?

I would think people have to spend to eat.  They don't spend bitcoins as much right now because of the potential immediate value in my opinion.  
As the value normalizes and it becomes a world currency, they will spend them--at least that's what I'm thinking.
Bottom line--homies gotta eat and buy clothes.

I agree with you but even if that is true, just look at the statistics.  Potentially one guy gets killed vs. 10,000 Mexican mafia hits for the same amount of traffic.

Central company making a decentralized exchange...hmm.

He creates classes for prototype-based languages.

In short, it's best if money competes in an open market.  All of them will be stronger for it.

I tried this and got the following result: 
**Hi True,
Happy to hear you're as excited about Google Shopping Express as we are!
Using marshmallows as a payment method is something we're looking into.  However, we are leaning more toward roasted marshmallows. Thanks for sharing your feedback with us- I'll be sure to share your note with the team for consideration.
Of course, feel free to reach out at any time if you have other questions, suggestions, or concerns.
Later Jenny Shopping Express**
So...it appears they put some thought into it.
@_date: 2013-10-18 00:12:59
Fucking hilarious.  I hadn't seen it.  Thanks.
@_date: 2013-10-03 13:47:53
Guys...there are already a ton of crypto, p2ps.  Many have varying features.
They are all traded on open markets and prove their worth there, as it should be.
Check out coinmarketcap.com.

Western Union could be the first valid company to offer and promote bitcoin wallet credit cards.  
They could be the first to offer major backing for a type of green address/card where you don't have to wait for x nums of confirmations to feel safe.

We should look into an initiative for perma-living there with cheap ass underground housing or earthship housing.  That suff is quite real, you just have to find experts that can help the community.
@_date: 2013-10-06 20:30:44
Thanks.  That's what I thought but wasn't sure.  
You just gotta love the speed at which traditional money can be moved around and verified...lol.

Ok...ok...everybody you heard him.  Let's sneak in....shh.  I'm tiptoeing how about you? 
 Shhh. Be vewy vewy quiet, I'm hunting wagulators.

I understand.  I feel that most laws are put in place by major law breakers for only their benefit.  Having said that, I don't like jail.  :)

My advice to programmers:  Learn to evaluate bullshit from reality instead of following stupid ass guidelines like this.
Otherwise, don't beg me to get on after another programmer has taken the huge chunk of profit sharing AND the profits start to roll in.  
I hate these dumb ass guidelines.  They are written by newbie programmers fresh out of college usually that still need people to help them sort out good business propositions.

I would imagine that international trade would be an excellent foothold for bitcoin.  This may be local but think about buying internationally and not having to do any conversions.
@_date: 2013-10-10 21:29:39
Folks are going to have to start fighting back with lawsuits if bitcoin is to survive.
