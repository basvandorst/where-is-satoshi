This appears to be turing complete (it can calculate anything that can be calculated)--assuming the force required to flip the gates won't break it when you stack hundreds or thousands of them in a row--so the answer is yes.
However, if it's as fast as I think it will be, we're looking at multiple seconds for each ALU operation. You might be measuring the output in hashes/day. Or maybe /week.
Plus, you'd have to build memory to represent all the data you want to hash, and a bus to get it to your ALU, and a short program to tell it what to do when-- basically, you'd need to construct a whole computer. I think the resulting device would fit inside a football stadium, but I'm not sure.
Edit: look at the computers people have made in minecraft for an idea of the scale required. Those Lego gates are smaller (1/20th-1/50th the size?) than equivalent minecraft gates, but otherwise are very similar.

Of course not; different people have different profitability points.

I got it too, sent to my mt. gox email. I marked it as phishing...

They'd be more profitable if you'd turned off your mining rig and bought btc with the money you'd have spent on electricity.

You're suggesting the government subsidize our bitcoin habit (buy high, sell low = bitcoins become more affordable to those who want them)? I think we can all get behind that!

It should be easy to show that you owned coins for more than a year. The blockchain records the time they were sent to your address, and you have the private key, which proves you own the address. Am I missing something? (I suppose it could be an issue if you bought the coins and left them sitting on an exchange without records...)

It'd be dumb to leave funds in an address if you are not the only holder of the private key. Even in the case where you're being risky and making a trade by getting the private key to an address, you should immediately transfer the funds to an address you control. Holding the private key should be sufficient proof.
Hopefully someone else will fight this out in court so o don't have to. :)

That's not the right math. Growth in markets is exponential, not linear. You want to figure out the average percentage increase. Solve for x: 130 * x ^ (12*30) = 50,000
x^360 = 50,000/130
x^360 = 10^2.58
log (x^360) = 2.58
360 * log x = 2.58
log x = 2.58/360
x = 10^(2.58/360)
x = 1.016
If your prediction is right (which I say nothing about), what the math actually says is that bitcoin should increase on average by about 1.6% per month.
