Somebody with a lot of influence wanted to make some fast cash so he basically switched to bitcoin cash and now is selling it after the price went way up and is buying back into bitcoin while it's low before it goes up

Same issue for me. Same day of deposit as you and I'm not supposed to get it until the 28th. Kinda annoying but not much you can do about it

With a regular PC it will cost much more in electricity than you will make from mining. They have huge mining pools now that do the majority of it

If people had their btc in the coinbase exchange at the time of the fork they were then entitled to equal amounts of bch. But since the exchange didn't support bch, they said their users will get it on January 1st. That's when coinbase is going to release all the bch to the people that had their btc in the exchange. So on the 1st there will be a lot more bch availabel to people for trading and the price of bch and btc will go crazy for a bit

What if it's not lower later? With the rate we're going it's only increasing.

BCH adjusts their difficulty in about 12 hours and it will likely mean that mining BTC will once again become more profitable

I didnt know how low we would go so I bought a little when it jumped back up to $5800 and then a little more at $6000. Feels good

Delta is a cool android app to track various cryptos

If you have a coinbase account already I would get verified and then use their exchange which is called GDAX to buy/sell bitcoin. And if you're new I would just suggest something like Electrum as a bitcoin wallet. It's simple and easy to use

Don't invest anything you aren't willing to lose. That said, it's completely up to you. You could lose it all or the price could skyrocket. Don't listen to people on here and do some research and make a decision on your own. 
If I were you I'd wait for it to go down just a little more before buying in. We're still are close to the the all time high and the price will probably decrease a little more in my opinion

It dropped 40% in 30 minutes... I don't think that's a minor dip

It'll take a while but if it's an invalid address it definitely won't go through
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:11:42
It was at $2800 an hour ago and now it's at ~$1650

It just takes a while. I had the same problem a few days ago switching my remaining BCH to BTC. It took about 2 hours to go through. It still locks in the rate you submitted it at though so I wouldn't worry
@_date: 2017-10-13 04:25:36
Nobody knows. It could go up another 2-3k or it could drop back down to 3000. You just can't really tell
@_date: 2017-10-13 04:38:12
oh definitely not! Just saying that if you go to another sub like they will say that bitcoin is doomed because there are better options like BCH lol
@_date: 2017-10-13 04:34:16
The majority of people on this sub will say that yes, if you hold on to BTC long enough you will definitely make a profit. Some even say it could be 10k by early next year. But there are a lot of people who think BTC is bound to fail eventually. My opinion is that it will continue to grow but I have no idea how long it will take or what value it will have in 1 year or 5 years. 
Just be a smart investor and don't invest more than you're willing to lose
