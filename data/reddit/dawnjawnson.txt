TOTALLY BLANKED OUT ON THIS ONE.  I actually interviewed Lyle Preslar, the guitarist for minor threat.  While this is slightly less cool than interviewing Ian, I was still really pumped about it. He was super cool.  Not at all what I expected lol.  I grew up listening to punk rock, and I know about the whole minor threat straight edge thing, so I was kinda expecting him to be wild and eccentric and the whole punk rock bit.  But he was surprisingly normal lol.  He lives in a nice house in a nice part of NJ, has a wife and a kid (possibly more now), and seemed very well put together and educated.  He went to law school and got his degree, and (if i remember correctly) was doing contract related law stuff lol.  I had a really great conversation with him.  I wish I had a copy of the paper but its on my old laptop that got stolen shortly after this lol
