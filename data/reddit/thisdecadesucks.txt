They do do that.  There are stretches of roads built between certain state highways that are privately owned and maintained (within the regulatory framework, of course).. and they charge prices that fit the supply and demand of the local market.  I can either choose to pay the fee (somewhere between .50 cents and 2 dollars usually) to use it, and the money goes to the corporation, or I can take longer to use the crappy state road.  My choice.  I know of such a road in my community that is owned by an Australian corporation.  It is the nicest, smoothest, least inconvenient highway in the area by far.  It would make no sense for someone to buy a road just to exclude people from it.  That is not profitable and would not benefit anyone really... unless its just a super rich person who wants to start forming their own coercive state.
Also, pay-per-use is not the only model of paying for roads... They could sell advertisements or products of some kind, or work from any other viable business model.  I have confidence that humans are creative enough to get these things done peacefully.

I never said anything about rules vanishing.  The general rules people live by on a day-to-day basis are not based on government.  They are based on the vast majority of people's desire to live peacefully with one another.  Only the predators and psychopaths of the world have a desire to rule others... and what a perfect vessel government is to make such a dream into reality. 


I never made any claim that I *know* how things will be.  I have thoughts and projections about how a free society would operate, because I find such a mental task fun and interesting.  We do not know how things would work transportation-wise without government regulations and communized roads.  I believe individuals on the free market can come up with creative ideas and solutions that are blocked from possibility today, due to government.


I never asserted that in any way, whatsoever.  Please show me where I said that "rules are bad for society"... This is something you made up and attributed to me.  "Rules" are different than "Laws"... Rules are a more fluid concept that exists without laws, and change with the evolution of society. Rules also vary from place to place based on the preferences of property owners.  Wal-Mart has rules to follow in their stores, but if you break a rule, I doubt it will end up as badly as if you broke a "law".  Laws are dictates by the state backed by threats of violence.  They usually change much much slower and usually are behind the times.  Please do not put words in my mouth, as it really does nothing for your arguments.

Well in that case, what if someone showed up to your house and pointed an AK47 at your face and said "give me all your money, so i can go open a soup kitchen for homeless people... and if you don't, I am going to lock you in a cage in my basement"... you cool with that?  Because you basically just said that was an ok thing to do.
@_date: 2013-05-26 03:50:55
I think all of the above-mentioned things can be built and maintained through voluntary payment in the free market.  If enough people in a community want a particular service, it is likely that someone will start a business to fill the need.  I do not suffer from a lack of gratitude, but rather a lack of tolerance for violence and coercion.  I just don't understand why you are so hostile.
@_date: 2013-05-26 02:08:44
in a free society you can make those choices, because the market is based on voluntary decisions by individuals.  the government makes money by forcing me to pay for it, and then delivering whatever services it thinks are important, including drone bombing children overseas and paying banks billions of dollars to make risky bets.  you can cringe all you want, but it seems like you are not aware that I do have more than a cursory understanding of these issues.  It is not fair to write me off as a person in that manner.

If you had the choice to only pay taxes for the things you want the government to do... would you choose that?  Or would you prefer the government take your money at the rate of its choosing and spend it on whatever they want, whether you like it or not?  Does putting a piece of paper in a suggestion box every few years give you a sense of control over these people who call themselves "government"?  I find it hard to believe that you have any faith that these people will work in your best interest, when there mere existence is a violation of your individual rights.

@_date: 2013-05-25 16:18:51
i don't know how every single little dispute would turn out, because i am not a central planner nor am i a psychic.  the marketplace can only create tyranny through violence, and once a company uses violence to fund and maintain itself, it then becomes a government, which contradicts the concept of a market... at which point the problem would be one of statism.  nobody is saying the world would be perfect and totally without violence... that is a pipe dream... but i would rather take my chances with several road providers competing for business than one organization that forces me onto its crappy roads with its mercenaries patrolling them for extortion funds at every corner.

Well, I said the private sector would look vastly different if taxes and regulation were *zero*, not just less.  This is an opinion of mine, but I find it hard to believe that things wouldn't be vastly different.  I see a vast difference between a society being organized around institutionalized violence and a society based on voluntary interaction.  Depends on what your standard of "vast" is.

The US Government did not invent the internet, because the US Government is a collectivist abstraction.  it is a concept that only exists in the minds of those who claim to be a part of it.  In the case of the internet some engineers and scientists and electricians invented it.  These were individuals who were hired with stolen money (taxes) to develop this thing called the internet, which was originally used as a military tool.  Are you suggesting that without government, the internet would have never been invented?  That without institutionalized theft, violence, and extortion, that we would all be living in squalor?  The most unregulated industry in the world is the computer industry, and it has grown faster than anything in the past 20 years.

You are shaming and condemning me because I choose not to pay into a system that I never agreed to be part of?

Democracy always devolved into fascism.  Look at the USA... Total fascist system that is rapidly becoming a police state nightmare.

in a free society, there would not be a "country"... in order to have this entity known as a "country", you must have a central government that enforces its borders with violence and threats.  Governments make war much easier and much bigger, because governments attack governments... If the american government were to disappear, and people started trading voluntarily on the market for protection services, no country would want to invade it.  This is because there would be no tax-base to take control of, and there would be no clear definition of "winning"... instead of invading a "country" where you can take over the government and thus the people, an invading force would literally have to take over every household, every police and protection agency, and every individual person.  The decentralization acts as a mosquito net that traps anyone in its complexity...
@_date: 2013-05-26 04:50:58
i absolutely do think they could be maintained with voluntary agreements in a variety of different schemes.  In a free society, there would not be a monopoly road provider that builds the roads where it sees fit for its purposes and regulatory desires, but rather a network of privately owned roads that charge market prices and compete with one another for use.  I imagine it may be subscription-based, but who knows for sure how it would be.  If pay-per-use proves to be unworkable, there are other options like selling advertisement space to businesses, or products, or extra services on roads (car-wash, pay extra and the traffic lady will flash her boobs, who the fuck knows, the possibilites are endless), or some other scheme to fund the roads... I am not so pessimistic about human capacity to adapt.  I would enjoy a world with more variety and choices and decentralized development of society.

I don't see the persecution of anyone as legitimate, much less the Nazi situation in Germany.  It was horrible and unthinkable.  The point I am making is that "The people" are not the government, because the government is made up of a very small minority of people in a given territory.  These people exempt themselves from the very rules they impose on everyone else (theft, extortion, rape, murder, imprisonment, etc.) and claim moral legitimacy.  How do they achieve this?  Indoctrination through schools and their manipulation of the money system through the central banks and fiat currency... among other things.  If "the people" are the government, then anything the government does would be something done to itself by itself... and if we are all part of this government, than everything the government does is something that I am doing... so YOU and I would be stealing from ourselves, raping ourselves at airports, kidnapping ourselves and putting ourselves in cages... It is just crazy insane.  We are NOT the government.

Because the government claims ultimate ownership of all roads, whether they are private (at least in terms of upkeep and management) or public.  The road system has been communized, and there are not any real opportunities for free market roads...  you have to play by their rules or your road is shut down.  and you have to pay taxes (rent) to "own" the land..

@_date: 2013-05-25 15:57:22
i know... i was doing it toungue and cheek.  the answer is simple... people will build the roads.  if people need a road, the land owner will build a road... if people want said road, they will pay for it.  people already pay for the roads, but they are roads built and designed by government to benefit government.  for example, the highway system was built to facilitate the military, not mimic the natural flow of traffic.  few people even wanted the highways when they were built.

If everyone tried to drive a hybrid, the price would skyrocket as it would cause a shortage of Platinum (there are other substances too but I cant remember their names)... and Hydrogen cars are just an absolute failure that even the government knows will never work...

Well a combustion engine is very complicated and requires tons of maintenance and breaks often, as we all know.  It was a great technology for the time, but I find it hard to believe that in the last 100 years, there has literally been no progress outside of improving the performance of the combustion engine, and even that is debatable.  You will find people who would rather use the car technology of 50 years ago vs. today.  Hovercraft and low-altitude flight technology is not possible because the governmetn claims ownership of all the air above the earth in its territory.  That is why drones are just now coming to fruition.. We have had the capacity for drone technology for over 50 years without a doubt, if not even longer...

Well your example of railways and canals is a great point, because that was the free market's preference.  In the early 20th century, the car was invented, and then the government literally destroyed what was being developed in exchange for a completely car-based transportation system.  The reason people sit in traffic for 2 hours to commute on horribly clogged roads is because the government forced that configuration.  In a free society, such things would not be profitable, and peopel would seek out alternatives.  I may be wrong on the details, but I think GE and Standard Oil colluded to get government to favor their technology over their competitors...

i am sure if a road company (whose job is to make and maintain roads) would, by nature, have an incentive to fix pot-holes, because if they neglect their customers, their customers will refuse to pay, and that will harm their reputation and business model... if it gets REALLY bad, someone will come up with a business to create another road or some kind of alternative access to a road that is not so crappy.  perhaps neighbors would band together and pool their resources to create another road between the houses that circumnavigates the horrible pot-hole neglectors.... who knows?!  i am confident a pot-hole will not start a war

you act as if there were another choice...  you act as if i want my cake and want to eat it too.  no.  i want the free market to provide a multitude of choices for such services.  I would be happy to pay for a service that I wish to receive at a market price.  What I don't want are these huge social programs that require the government to rob from current and future generations to pay for...all the while the Federal Reserve prints endless amounts of money and gives it to their banker friends, which totally distorts the entire economy.  Think past "our roads" and "our this" and "our that"... you act as if we all got together around the campfire and had a 100% consensus on what and how these services should be.

I don't care how rich it makes someone.  I do not consent to have my wealth and property confiscated and redistributed.  Theft is immoral, no matter what.... and what is a "rich country"?  Are you referring to the government being rich or the individual subjects of that government?  And what are the rich in?  Fiat currency?  Redistributionism?  Socialized healthcare?  These things may, in some places, provide benefits to people, but these benefits are tainted with force and violence.  In order for Norway and Luxembourg to fulfill these Marxist ideals you speak of, there must be threats of violence to collect the money against the will of the people.  I don't appreciate the ad-hominem attacks.  It is of no concern to you how old I am, and it is very telling of your character that you would say something like that as a rebuttal.

The "developing" world has been subject to colonialism and government for centuries.  And not-to-mention religion and civil wars, and the like.  The question is not whether a state can build a functioning road system.  It is proven that a state can manage to do this, but the real issue is principle.  Is it really a good thing that a monopoly forcefully expropriates money from everyone, and then builds a road where it wants to build roads, whether it is helpful or not?  For example, the highways system was very unpopular when it was proposed, and it was designed to facilitate government and military purposes first, not the organic travel desires of people.  The real point is that if people want a road to go from one point to another, *someone* will find a way to make it happen, and most certainly at a lower cost than government, and without pointing guns in people's faces.  There are people all over the country that can't even get the government to fix potholes, so they are pooling their resources and doing it themselves with private companies... just one example i found:    i have seen more though

Yes I have considered that you are reacting in a hostile way toward me, because you seem to think that I am a "deadbeat"... I don't expect nor want the government to take care of me when I am old.  I am positive social security will be non-existant by then anyway... I advocate voluntary action in the free-market, which is not a deadbeat idea.  You can try and shame me all you want, but I will not bend to support violence.  I would never use violence to impose my will on you, and I would hope you would extend the same to me.

according to Karl Marx's theory?  That makes me giggle, because Marx is so discredited... I wouldn't use Marx to back anything up.  Anarcho-capitalism is not a system that proactively stops anything, other than government's force on people.  it is a situation in which people can freely trade ALL goods and services on the free market.  this includes police protection, courts, and building safety.  I find it very hard to imagine that the only way to make safe structures is to have a monopoly organization steal from everyone and force a specific building code on people?  you are asking me how anarcho-capitalism will prevent building collapse?  I imagine that people would want buildings to be safe for themselves and patrons... and there would be many building companies with different reputations and standards... you ahve to remember that in a free society, if a building collapses, the people inside would have valid cases against the faulty builder and said builder would go out of business...

I am not in australia. I live in the United States.  In the end, it comes back to principle.  Do you want a system of roads forced on people against their will?  Or do you want a road system that develops based on the individual contracts and preferences of individuals acting in the free market?  I choose the latter.  I would be proud to pay for roads that benefit me and provide a good service.  I am not proud of being robbed and then given crap roads with potholes that they can't even fix because they are broke.  Broke businesses go bust, which is the natural purging of inefficiency in the marketplace.

So if "the people" are the government, does that everything the government does has implicit consent of "the people"?

there will always be some form of "regulation", but it just depends on how it happens... you can have markets determine regulations based on the general preferences and business patterns of individuals... or you can have some forceful organization impose its own arbitrary will on everyone in a given area... in any case, natural law still applies... stealing will always be wrong, regardless of how much government steals..

Competing road systems could work, because they have existed in the past in a variety of scenarios, and there are even some privately owned roads today (despite having to conform to government regulations).  For us, because "the roads" have already been built for the most part, all it would be is a transfer from public to private ownership.  But if you were starting from scratch, roads would be projects conceived by agreements between private property owners.  Just because you find it hard to imagine how two or more competing road systems could work doesn't mean that they actually can't work.  There have been entire books written on this very subject, most notably by Ludwig von Mises:

The beauty of this is that I don't have one.  I am not a central planner nor am I an expert on water treatment or anything of the sort.  In a free society, things wouldn't be centrally planned in the way they are now.  I will say,however, that despite my lack of engineering prowess, I don't believe that the current monopoly system on water distribution is the only way.  Before there was city/county water (which they put chemicals in), people dug wells, and that worked pretty well for the time...  I imagine a world where companies are not given regional monopolies on utility services, and many different options exist.  I believe it is possible.

I was really optimistic, but the bubble bursting and bitfloor and the dDos attacks, and now the account seizure... i think this is the year the government comes after bitcoin and i think this is just the first step.  i didnt cash in all my coins... i cashed in enough to get my initial investment back, so now i have nothing to lose. i am kind of broke and need the money to pay rent so thats where im at.

I do not feel the benefits of taxation.  Every time I get in my car and drive down communized roads patrolled by thugs in funny costumes and shiny badges, it is not a benefit.  The government has regulated and forced this society to have a certain configuration of roads and highways, and has thus created an automobile-dependent system that will be very hard to evolve past.  In a free-society you would see different modes of transportation competing to be the most efficient.  The government roads are crap, mostly, and get clogged up frequently, and we just think this is the best it could be.  The second the government steps out of the industry, you would see an explosion of innovation.  I am still waiting on my hovercraft.

I think this is incorrect.  I have been to 14 countries, and the companies that are making cars are heavily regulated.  They are more regulated in Europe than in the US, less regulated in places like India, but there is nowhere in the world where there are car companies operating completely in a free market.  Nowhere.

I am well aware that I am in the minority.  But what does that have to do with anything?  Just because most people support government programs does not make them justifiable or legitimate.  Hitler was democratically elected by a majority of German voters.  Does that mean that Hitler was justifiable in his actions?  Of course not.  Your comment about "liberals" being the most highly educated is a matter of opinion.  What do you mean by "educated"?  I would say that people who have benefitted the most from the plunder of government would consider themselves pro-state.  Also most people who went to government schools and learned pro-state propaganda for 13 years of their lives will probably come out as liberal, seeing as how that is what the system promotes.  Underneath your comment, I hear "Your beliefs are weird and must not be right because most people don't agree with you.  I am smarter than you because I am a "liberal".  Why can't you just admit that your ideas are lame and unpopular?"... I am not making an ad hominem attack, but I do feel a sense of contempt coming from you.  I think that may be because you haven't delved into the philosophical basis of anarchism, and its many variations.  Appealing to the bandwagon effect really doesn't serve as much of a counterargument.  I would rather talk from a philosophical, principles-based position, because that is what it is really all about.
