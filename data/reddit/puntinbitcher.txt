Congratulations. Your post has now been seen by a few thousand people who've never heard of Bitcoin Cash before. They're going to google it and find out it's just like Bitcoin, but without the enormous transaction fees.

The proposed fork would not require any changes to existing wallets.  Even the types of changes that make older wallet software obsolete don't invalidate coins.  As long as you have the private keys to your wallet addresses you will be able to import them into wallet software that works with future Bitcoin forks.  As I understand it only miners and exchanges would need to worry about compatibility in this case.

I'm not the right person to ask for a "better" slogan, but here's what I don't like about the AirBNB comparison.  I don't think "AirBNB for hard drives" is a very clear description.  If I'd never heard of Storj, I'd read this and think it had something to do with physically exchanging hard drives that belong to other people (Yes, it sounds stupid, but lots of people are computer illiterate enough to draw this conclusion).  Also, defining your product by comparing it to some other well established product reeks of desperation in my opinion.  It tells me that you can't define your product on it's own merits.  Please take what I just said with a grain of salt, since I'm not the best judge of how other people will respond.

The problem is that if someone steals your fingerprint, you can't change your fingerprint to block them from using it.  You can always change a PIN if someone steals it.

Out of all the fucked up crooked politicians in the US, Brock Pierce had to give money to Rick Perry.  At least all the other crooked politicians have the decency to pretend like they aren't corrupt.

According to [Wikipedia]( money laundering specifically involves masking some sort of criminal activity.

Who's Barry?

I'm just the right age.

Another way to describe this pattern would be:  Sometimes the price goes up, and sometimes it goes down.

I really hope you let us know if they pay you for this post.

When you say he got it illegally, do you mean he stole it or do you mean he earned it from selling something like drugs?
@_date: 2015-09-01 21:45:52
Yes, that seems to be what you said.
@_date: 2015-04-16 00:57:54


I would have thought that was obvious.  Why is this still a lesson that still needs to be learned?

A couple guys posed for a picture in an airplane.

How are they shady?
@_date: 2015-09-07 15:00:53
Not much of a surprise, considering how this sub has devolved into a forum for petty bickering.
@_date: 2015-04-07 20:19:28


Does that mean he only eats conservatives?

I thought BIP101 doubles the block size every two years, so shouldn't the blue plot be parabolic instead of linear?

They're donating 100% of profits, not 100% of proceeds.

This was a great discussion on how fucked our criminal justice system is.

No.  Read the article.

He's insane for a number of reasons, but a 100 fold increase in bitcoin's price over the next ~3 years wouldn't be the craziest thing that's ever happened.
Of course, it could also drop down to $100 by the end of 2020.
@_date: 2015-04-24 01:51:02
I don't agree with him that it's going to be the downfall of Bitcoin, but I think it's a bit of an embarrassment that this community is such a sausage fest.
@_date: 2015-03-20 19:14:52
And which one would that be?
@_date: 2015-03-21 14:12:50
Why would you want this?
@_date: 2015-11-04 14:22:41
In early 2014 the largest Bitcoin exchange became insolvent and pretty much everyone who was storing their coins there lost it all.  There is no guarantee this won't happen again.

Do you have any examples to back up your name-calling?
@_date: 2015-03-25 22:35:41
No, it isn't.  GreenAddress.it did nothing wrong in this case, but OP is basically accusing them of stealing his money.

You are doing the Lord's work when you provide the NSFW links like this. $1.

It works.  You just have to keep trying about 50 times until you get lucky.

So do we still hate Mark Karpeles, or do we like him now?  I'm so confused.  Please tell me what to think.

What's a "he drawing"?

I donated, since I lack the free will to do otherwise.
@_date: 2015-11-03 23:52:46
So you don't agree with the part about not keeping money in exchanges?

Suck it, Kanye!

Such as?
@_date: 2015-03-08 17:21:01
That doesn't answer OP's question in the least bit.

Buy low, and sell high.  As long as you know how to do those two simple things, you'll definitely get rich.

Wow.  It has a solid 0% on Rotten Tomatoes.  I'm impressed.

The QR code isn't very helpful to those of us watching it on our phones.  Including the text address somewhere that can be copied would be good for this type of thing in the future.

It just occurs to me that this list is a total sausage fest.  Are there or have there ever been any women on the foundation?
