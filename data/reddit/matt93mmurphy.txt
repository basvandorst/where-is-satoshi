How would demand not rise with all that's coming?

I think I heard baakt launches July 22nd or something.

I think that depends on where the top is my friend. Dollar cost averaging is probably your best bet. But I wouldn't wait too long.

Market is growing too fast, its not a bubble, theres no fad, a transfer of wealth is coming. We are slowly kiling the usd dollar.
@_date: 2017-12-25 16:19:31
No i believe the us dollar is killing itself with our national debt and inflation. We are just going to win because of it.

We just crashed 40 percent, another 40 percent correction would be crazy right now. We are bouncing in the fib zones currently. It will start moving up again soon.

Its a bubble popping every time the price drops more than 20%. Bubbles dont apply to crypto the way they do the stock market. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 01:05:48
wait.. im using bitpay.. should i not be for some reason?
@_date: 2017-08-18 20:38:41
We are dipping to 4k, when will we go back up?
@_date: 2017-08-18 21:45:19
can you at least tell me why its dipping? it cant be fork not until nov
@_date: 2019-06-24 22:49:15
So does that mean by default, if you have 1 btc then you are automatically a millionaire?
@_date: 2019-06-26 05:48:44
Jesus based on it going from 11.9 to 12.9 in an hour I'd say anything is possible.
@_date: 2019-06-26 05:42:47
The bull market has just begun.. wise words Yoda man.
@_date: 2019-06-26 01:17:16
Our current volume is already 5x higher then the volume at the peak of the 2017 rally. Once we break 20k, it will get mainstream retail attention and that's when the real fun begins.. hold on to your pants.. this years gunna get wild.

Can confirm, am white young male and own some bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-04 18:32:09
I love it. I see it as an opportunity  to buy more cheap btc
@_date: 2019-06-24 22:47:01
The value of bitcoin protects its holders from inflation. Bitcoin will always be infinitely more valuable then the US Dollar.
@_date: 2019-06-16 04:18:40
They would have to do this very specifically. And be very very careful on security.
@_date: 2019-06-16 04:56:24
I mean it could temporarily dip below 9k but once we surpass 11-12k, its possibly pretty safe to say 9k is done.
@_date: 2019-06-24 22:44:02
Only 75 million people could EVER own .28 btc at any given time. And that is best case scenario. You are truly a rarity my friend.
@_date: 2019-06-09 05:55:58
Could be a sim swap hack. Happened to me but I'm on t mobile. Be careful and change your sim card and passwords. Use 2fa when you can (not phone 2fa).
@_date: 2019-06-12 22:40:53
I think your right. In a decade, we could see this I think.
@_date: 2017-09-20 22:58:03
And this is probably why I have been ignored by them for 2 months with a locked account
@_date: 2019-05-14 05:06:47
I think that's called catching falling knives. Predicting tops and bottoms is nearly impossible.
@_date: 2019-05-22 04:25:23
I personally think bitcoin is the brand name and technologically there are much better projects out there.
@_date: 2019-05-14 05:20:06
You will never get good advice here by friend. Investigate and figure out what your gut tells you. Use logic.
@_date: 2019-05-16 18:33:15
So does this indicate that we have another year before a true bull market?
