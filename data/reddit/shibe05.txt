Can someone tell me if bitnodes works with a dynamic IP address?

LTB is a great network, lets design the new bitcoin forum connected to the LTB network from the start! Great!

oh, sorry! I meant the bitnodes incentive program

I'm running Win8 and i don't trust it. Because of that i created a offline wallet on an old laptop before trading my dogecoins.

Who cares if its a secure end to end encryption!? You still have to tust WhatsApp (Facebook) that their proprietary application is not spying on you. Encryption without proven privacy is worthless these days..

You should include Vitalik Buterin (ethereum)

I don't know what amount of dogecoin is high enough for you to be noteworthy. This post was not about numbers it was about a change of mind.

No! If my understanding of the blockchain technology is correct, bitcoin is just the beginning.

But if i sell it i can't continue the most educational hobby i ever spent my time on. I'm also not contributing to the bitcoin network if i sell it. Is there no way to make profit with it? I thought about mining one of the new altcoins (that don't cosume much power) and run a full bitcoin node on it.
But i have to study these new coins first (i'm still a noob).

I think you are right but i hope there is a place for dogecoin, curecoin, solarcoin, litecoin, ltbcoin and whatever coin i think has a good reason to exist in the future. Most coins are nonsense but some have a good reason to exist.

And if bitcoin went up to the moon, the tips i received in the last 2 hours would make me even more richer. I think bitcoins point is not to make people rich. It's point is to make money fair and because it's so new and open i feel like a pioneer in a very big global group of people that are all trying to figure out the possibilities of this new technology.
I think bitcoin brings freedom to money and i will use half of the bitcoins i received in tips to tip other comments i like because that makes me feel better and i am free to do so :)

Yes way! I was already tier2 verified. I Just had to upload my documents and contact support. 10 Minutes later i got this "I have reviewed your documents and your account has now been verified to Tier 3. Happy Trading!"
@_date: 2014-05-31 16:55:46
sell the rig and buy more bitcoin? I might do that.  ...not
@_date: 2014-10-23 11:44:55
took me like 10 minutes to get tier3 verified and you only need one utility bill not older than 3 months.

I guess you should think more about what the blockchain technology means and can do until you see its potential.
@_date: 2016-01-01 16:02:35
I don't. It's not hard to notice that the current BT Core developers do what they want. If it's something they don't want, Wladimir will say "we need full consensus" if it's something they want, they will just go ahead and implement it. Much like the censoring on r/bitcoin works. Gavin was much better in making decisions than Wladimir is.

Why is it not a good idea to use bip38?
@_date: 2016-01-01 15:49:51
ahh I see. That makes sense. But I think it's a good idea to use it for paper wallets.
@_date: 2016-01-01 15:35:25
That does not answer my question. I use bip38 for paper wallets and I think it's great. So why is it a bad idea to use it? Developer consensus is not worth much these days.

hahaha... he said bitcoin is not guaranteed. So what... the Euro is not guaranteed either.  In fact it already failed, just ask the people from greece or cyprus how guaranteed their euro is.

"subject to terms and limitations" you mean the thousand pages that describes how the bank can take your money? The stuff they never tell you? What a great business strategy...
@_date: 2015-10-05 04:47:56
Don't you get it? I'm not talking about financial tools. I mean the currency/money itself. Fiat money is not guaranteed. The dutch banker said "bitcoin is not guaranteed" this is a pointless and stupid argument because fiat money is even less guaranteed.
What don't you understand about that statement? You think the money on your bank account is yours? Surprise! it's not! That is the kind of obtuse misunderstanding of fiat that is all too typical around here.
@_date: 2015-10-05 14:37:47
Because that insurance is not worth goat shit. Go ask the people in Greece or Cyprus what their insurance was worth after the banks and goverment took their money. 
Why don't you tell me next the story about how it was a good thing to bail out the failed banks.
@_date: 2015-10-01 10:27:43
US Patent and Trademarks Office... haha yeah.
They obviously invented the invention and have all rights to decide who invented what and when... sure
@_date: 2015-10-03 04:29:08
The fiat regulation and insurance is a lie. By saying bitcoin is not guarateed you are implying that fiat money is guaranteed and that is a lie. The insurance is not guaranteed and the regulation is not working in your favor. I would say bitcoin is the most guaranteed money that ever exisited because it's math.

Dude... relax. I'm just saying that fiat money is not guaranteed now matter how many insurances and terms you bring up. When a bank decides the money is no longer yours it's gone. With Bitcoin that is not possible by default. All i'm saying.
@_date: 2015-10-01 09:45:37
It is invention. If I now describe a 100 things that I could make in the future I have invented nothing until i actually make them.
