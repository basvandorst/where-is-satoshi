The thing is, it's bound to take a significant fall at some point. It'll bounce back up, eventually, so I don't expect those who are holding to really take any losses long term. For those who are interested in buying low/selling high, this does look to be like a more long term downward trend than we've previously seen, so it is somewhat of a big deal.

What? Did you just realize what we were discussing? Or are you just stringing together words in hopes that you'll create a coherent sentence? 
Or maybe you're assuming that I'm denying "these sell-offs" (see [sell-off]( occurred? Which would be incorrect. Obviously it happened, I'm simply trying to point out that the recent drop in price doesn't follow the pattern of the last few sell-offs.
Furthermore, this is nothing but my own speculation. Once again I'll point out that it's up to you to determine where you *think* the market is headed. Sorry, had I realized you didn't know what you were talking about beforehand I wouldn't have bothered replying!

What charts? Stochastic, MACD, KDJ all indicating a much more steady decline than these sell-offs you're describing.

Yes, it's been stagnant and now falling for the last couple days, which is far from what we've been seeing in this last month. Like I said, it will take a fall eventually, it's up to you to determine whether or not you *think* this is it.
