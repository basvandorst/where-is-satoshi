I'm agreeing with ~ even if it was a fully-functioning example, financial software has much higher distribution protocols that run-of-the-mill "stuff." Anything that handles money is treated as broken until you can prove it's not, otherwise we just traded one problem for another.
So, someone posted an example and guide on how to fix it. Great! Now let's think about it for a couple days and make sure it works. Oh, it doesn't? Make some changes, think for a few days...implement on a test server, test that for a few days, then push to a sub-set of users with restricted use (beta) before pushing it to all live servers.
I'm a QA Engineer in the software sector for a high profile company. You don't just throw out patches willy-nilly, especially when it's dealing with money, non-perishable data, or anything that affects 100% of your user base; I would argue it's smarter to do it this way.

It was a joke response, but the principle is the same.
The people who make the change are the core developer team of the bitcoin protocol, and bitcoin-qt program. There are negative implications, such as "now we just doubled the amount of data we have to store and we're already at 12 gigabytes." (I'm sure there are more granular concerns as well).
Anyway, the core team would make the change which would propagate throughout the network because every node/pool is run off the core code which dictates the blockchain specification.
I'm sure when the pros outweigh the cons the change is pretty much that simple.

I should clarify: this is the *credit card* verification for instant purchases (the backup), not the debit card number used to charge purchases through a checking account. My credit card was verified as per the small transactions, but visa called me after they froze the card until I confirmed those were legit. THEN, not 24 hours later purchases for gift cards went through on that same account. The card was used for nothing else. I think you have a security leak or bug in your credit card verification process.

From a programmer's perspective it wouldn't be hard because it really is, probably, just a few variables that need tweaking.
From the perspective of someone who has to deal with all the implications of changing those variables...it's much more complex; considering who it affects, how much, and why are factors that make it hard...but as I understand it 1 Mb was just an arbitrary point to put the limit.
