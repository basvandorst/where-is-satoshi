I think everybody can agree that the healthcare system in the U.S. right now needs some major reform. But why do people suddenly think that government supplied healthcare is the magic fix-all solution. When has the government ever run ANY of its programs efficiently, or even effectively. Hell look at healthcare.gov, and that was a WEBSITE! But suddenly the government will snap into a non-bureaucratic well oiled machine that handles healthcare efficiently. Right.

If you watched your life savings wash down the drain is it really unreasonable to wish for some way to get even a little of that back? I didn't have money on gox, but I easily could have and feel for those that do.

How else do you recommend people buy and sell Bitcoins? Solely through localbitcoins.com?

With the amount of trades happening it would be stupidly expensive and inefficient to have all transactions be on the Blockchain. I understand the point you are trying to make, but the idea of being your own bank and trusting no one is optional. If people WANT to trust an exchange/escrow/retail outlet then they should be allowed to do just that.  The point is you can make decisions for yourself and let other people do the same.

It is very easy for ME to use bitcoin in transactions, but not for someone like my grandparents who don't even have soild internet connection and would not be able to adopt any crypto currency in the near future. 
Also, why are bitcoins safer? I understand merchants won't have to deal with charge backs but for the individual things like wallet hacking, fraudulent businesses, scams ect.  would be worse as they couldn't be reversed

I thought one of the arguments for bitcoin was that it isn't tied to any government or country.

I have. I didn't really get an answer to my question in it but thank you anyways!

Wouldn't that be riskier for the individual getting scammed out of bitcoins?  Because the charge back option is there to protect you from scams and fraudulent purchases?

Does anyone have experience with a thumb drive wallet? It seems like putting bitcoins onto a thumb drive and putting that into a safe/safety deposit box would be theft proof and easy to keep track of.

It's not fishy that all the murder charges were dropped for no apparent reason? I mean we have to look at the facts and if he had someone killed then yeah.. he deserves his sentence. But if they had ANY real evidence it would have been at least presented at the trial.
When have murder charges ever just fizzled away...

yes but when you talk people tend to listen

People aren't stupid. They know that sponsorships and advertisements are meant to sell something. Do we really want people to feel like they are being persuaded to put money into a very young monetary system that, from the outside, has the appearence of a ponzi scheme? Or do we want these people to notice when others begin to adopt this alternate currency simply because it has several advantages over our current established currency  system. 
Tl;Dr: Is bitcoin something we really want to sell?
