TA is fun to watch and speculate on, but it's 95% useless really. 
It also annoys me that in most TA's people draw Bitcoin is never falls below their moving average, almost as if they are pushing their agenda and not actually reading chart patterns ��
That's my 50p anyway. I do believe in support zones, but some people take TA predictions too far

I'd delete this if I were you. Great you've got some BTC, but the wrong people could be looking at this

Let's make an very imaginary scenario for the guy. Let's say fast forward 10 years and BTC hits $1,000,000. 
Well guess What, your mate David remembered you posting a photo years ago  aof your 0.67 of a Bitcoin. That's now worth $670,000. It wouldn't be long before he turns up with a hammer at your door demanding a few $$$

The Ledger Nano X is brilliant. Stores a vast majority of coins. Has a brilliant interface when using Ledger Live. Easy to setup and use. Doesn't require any 3rd party sites to enable the storage of some coins. Plus there's plenty of tutorials online if you ever get stuck with anything. Can't fault it.
Trezor is also handy to use as it stores a vast majority of coins aswell. Easy to setup. It becomes a pain when storing some coins such as Ethereum and Nem as you have to use 3rd party sites while the device is connected.
Both are priced brilliantly for the security they give you in my opinion.

Press coverage introduces Bitcoin to vast audiences. Thus causing the vast audiences to Google Bitcoin after the press coverage

For the past few days trading volume has been above $30 BILLION. Mega millions doesn't even come close. Even still, no dipshit would be so lucky to win a life changing amount of money to then gamble it's entirety again haha

You will have recovery seed words (12 or 24 useually) to use to recover your private keys to your wallet.
What flash drive did you use?
Was it a bought hardware wallet such as "Trezor" or "Ledger Nano S"?

We're drawing TA on what is essentially penny stocks on steroids. Like I said I believe in the support zones. 2k, 5k, 10k etc... but the micro movements where someone has technical analysis for it is just bull poop

You can take out cryptocurrency loans yes.
I myself would never recommend borrowing money in general though.
Here's a website with a list of several services available.

I know exactly what you're saying!
I once bought an uber with Bitcoin (Bought a gift card with BTC). I was like HOLY SHIT I paid for this with Bitcoin. The taxi drove 0.3 miles in 20mins as a crash happend in front of us. I had to Get out and walk to my destination as they shut the road. 
Those 0.3 miles were the best though!

This an approach people will probably take to try "shut down" Bitcoin.
But if you read the article it has this cracker in it. **ISIS used Canada-based payment gateway CoinPayments to convert bitcoins to fiat money**
So even if news outlets bash Bitcoin for funding terrorism, it's no more at fault that any standard fiat currency for funding illegal activities. Only difference is Bitcoin is 100% traceable to it's source.

It's not exactly fake news. The accounts have been linked to different terrorist organisations. It's just they way the story's told. 
They basically are trying to prove Bitcoin funds terrorism (which also proves it's a valid currency as people as using Bitcoin because they see it has value) but they also prove Fiat funds terrorism too. It's a silly way to try bash crypto isn't it.

Investing is buying an asset and sitting on it for years not touching it.
You're trading. You are trying to lock in profits in the hope the market moves South. Be careful what you are doing and decide if you would prefer to invest or trade.
