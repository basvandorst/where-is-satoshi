The more I see such posts. The more I am inspired to buy more bcash. I love gdax, I won't be done with them anytime soon.

If I listened to anyone in this subreddit I wouldn't have made the 1000% gains bcash has made me. I'm not dumping anytime soon.

Because you think new buyers are dumb right? So much that they will buy something they dont know. You are so much smarter than them, you must have an IQ of 5

The obsession of this forum with Roger is pathetic...
