Thanks for your response!  However kucoin doesn't allow me to convert my BTC to fiat currency.  It also doesn't allow me to withdraw my fiat currency to my bank account :(

Hi guys, here's a random question for you.
Does anyone know what is the best platform to covert BTC/ETH to Fiat Currencies in Hong Kong?  I found one called "Gatecoin" but the volumes are too low so you would take a big loss if you were selling BTC/ETH. 
Coinbase isn't supported in Hong Kong.  Bitstamp is currently not accepting any applications.  So I wonder what is the best alternative now?
Thanks in advance

This dip is caused by the Wall Street manipulators. They have thousands of short contracts in the Bitcoin Futures at CME which expire on the 26th. BTC will drop to possibly 8K, and will shoot back up to ATH's after the expiry of the futures contract.
This happened exactly the same way with CBOE a week ago, and now it is happening to the CME futures contracts. It makes sense for Wall Streeters because they make huge profits from selling off BTC from the futures, and then buy it back up to make even more money.
I swear, these guys should get arrested for manipulating the markets. Their buy/sell pattern is so easy to follow.
