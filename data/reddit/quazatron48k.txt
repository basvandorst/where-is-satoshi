I know. I was literally just writing that as a further update, but it was too depressing to finish once I realised we're being hit on all fronts. The only solution is to be a billionaire and not have these concerns.

Extending your argument further, we’re being robbed on three fronts. Shrinkflation. That pack of toothpaste you bought a few years ago was 150g, but now it’s 125g for a higher price. That box of cereal was 750g, now it’s 510g for a higher price but they changed the shape of the box to have less length so it’s still the same height to fit tightly in your cupboard. The worst of these recently...that pack of 12x Jaffa Cakes, is now 10x for slightly higher price. Oh how I adore Jaffa Cakes.

The BBC are just as bad - this article implies multiple exchanges stopped trading Bitcoin:

Just make sure you now own, or intend to own, at least 1 BTC. That decision may be enough for you to not worry about your loss.

Read up on GDAX, the exchange owned by Coinbase, so you can move from their consumer facing service, to the trading service for more experienced users and have zero fees. Coinbase run a very good service, considering the rising demand.
And just to steer you further in the right direction, you can buy on Coinbase.com using your C/C for 'ease'/speed, then log in to GDAX using the same credentials, and move your purchased coins from the Coinbase.com wallet, to your GDAX trading wallet (which is free/instant) - you can then withdraw those coins to your preferred wallet, for free, so in your example above, it would say zero.

You may be looking at a currency pair that does not match your region, so if you are in the US, make sure it is a USD pair, then you should see Deposit and Withdraw under the Margin Trading slider within GDAX.

This - eveyone buying on Coinbase or GDAX needs to know this - you can send your coins back to your wallet for free, every time, by only ever withdrawing on GDAX. Any concerns about high transaction fees don't apply in this particular situation.

1. Open 'First Direct' account.
2. Use web interface to make GBP Swift payment to Coinfloor, with zero fee and zero exchange rate fee as destination account is GBP too.
3. Coinfloor receives GBP and charges £5 fee, plus 0.37% of transaction (if I recall)
4. Buy BTC on the exchange with limit order, with zero fees.
5. Transfer BTC to wallet, with 0.0005 Tx fee.
If you place the Swift transfer before 8am, it's typically with Coinfloor by noon.

It looks like their datalink only has access to data points going back to around November 2017 (is that when CNBC first started showing it?), instead of the beginning of BTC, so all of the graphs will begin with the 19K peak, and thus look less favourable. If you click on 5Y or All, it is apparant - they should fix the data feed issue.
Edit: I logged a ticket explaining the issue.

Trezor Model T - don’t accidentally buy the old one, if you wanted the newest version. Preorders for the new version are only now being filled, so you might not yet be able to order the new version from their own shop.

An early Merry Christmas to you and your family! Thanks for the generosity. So much gold!

There are no links on the iOS version, unless they are very well hidden.

If you can bear the horror, check out his handful of posts over the last two months. rekt.

You are an idiot.

I think this guy/company is using generated aliases to recycle opposing arguments to get Coindesk clicks either way, here’s the opposite argument posted a few mins later: 
Edit: yeah, that account and this one are 1 year old, they look like they both recycle old posts to generate karma for some reason, presumably to push an agenda when needed.

Relax. I made two small BTC withdrawals 24 hours ago - one took about 12 hours, and the other took about 20; this is a busy time for moving BTC, it'll appear don't worry.
@_date: 2017-07-28 20:48:49
I had to wait 20 hours.
@_date: 2017-07-28 09:21:44
I made two withdrawals about 11 hours ago, both had the delay message. One of the two arrived this morning, so I'm not worried, will take some time during the chaos.
