No all I was doing was finding some old mining transactions from months ago and tracing where the coins went, more often than not they were just ending up in various holding bitcoin addresses coming up to a nice round number. It did not look like they were going to an exchange. I guess though that it could be someone buying off an exchange, but for the quantities that miners need to sell, I believe that they mainly sell on exchanges?

The reason that bitcoin acts as a store of wealth is due to it future as a currency. If it has no future as a currency then its value is $0.

Yes I know that egold was easier to take down for the US due to it being based there. I gave it as an example of the US banning a virtual currency.
Nevertheless if they ban exchanging and ecommerce in bitcoin then bitcoin may exist but it will never be a world currency.

You are the one being confrontational and rude.
I asked a valid question, you could have been referring to the bitcoin subreddit forum, or early adopters, or everyone, you were unclear in the way you phrased it.

Anyone who has coins on an exchange also has an address somewhere else, and surely they do not keep all their coins on the exchange (who would after all the high profile thefts), therefore actually his logic still applies as someone will have a corresponding address outside of the exchange.

Well assuming that a large percentage of the population does not go for life extension, then 20 billion will not get hit. Any new kid wont bring more people to earth as long as enough people are dying from suicide and accidents.
No I am assuming TFR decreases as it has done for many years, and will continue to go down, not an unreasonable assumption given it has been trending that way for many years. When I looked at it before population is set to decline in 2050.

I know it is pseudonymous, but good luck tracking the coins once they have been through multiple coin mixing services. 
I agree though that if all mixing services were compromised and all exchanges were compromised then you could potentially be tracked down, but it would take more than one subpoena, that would be coopting the whole network effectively.
@_date: 2014-03-20 16:15:28
Its the flaw that lets down this analysis a bit. Then again I can't imagine that too many people are comfortable keeping the majority of their coins with any third party after all the incidents of theft, so I think that it is fair to assume that most bitcoin owners have their own address as well as accounts with third parties, this means that his analysis would capture them also.
Also he has not done much analysis to actually identify shared addresses so I actually believe that his 500k is optimistic.

So lets say that the price crashes and it many miners go out of business (for the sake of argument) then would not the difficulty have to drop dramatically to keep up the same rate?

I will read up on opentransactions. 
I think the why would people cheat when they make good money argument answer, is that they would cheat if they can make more money by cheating you. If you are holding a large portion of bitcoins versus the majority then they have a huge incentive to cheat you.

Not necessarily, even if someone does not die from aging they can still die from an accident or by suicide. The calculations vary depending on what stats you go with, but that only gets you to an average age of about 1000 years before something other than aging kills you.

@_date: 2014-04-10 17:17:11
If bitcoin price goes down then all miners have less money to buy better rigs and difficulty goes down.  Difficulty goes down and then there rigs can cope again. 
EDIT: I see I am getting downvoted because some do not understand the bitcoin protocol, below shows the relevant details of how difficulty is calculated, and as you can see it is possible for it to go down.

I feel that your condescending attitude is not warranted given the mediocrity of your responses. I gave SatoshiDice as an example. The 100 most popular addresses does not catch all the gambling transactions as entities will not use just one address, they will use multiple. If I only exclude miners and the betting sites I found then I already get a number of transactions below the one that is quoted on this graph. 
There are many other non-commerce transactions bulking up the numbers. Have you actually analysed the blockchain to investigate?
@_date: 2014-03-30 18:49:40

Average life expectancy in the past was 30 years, I assume that the people back then would say the same as you. I assume that in 100 years when people live to 200 they will think that is normal.
People already want and practice life extension, they just call it staying healthy, not smoking, doing exercise etc.
As with any new technology the price of life extension will fall soon enough such that everyone can afford it.

I agree with you, I don't think there is strong evidence that the coins were stolen recently, just that they have been stolen, so it could be that they are being gradually sold already.
There is also the theory that what actually happened is that MK sold them when the market was much lower as he needed the funds.
Even if a theif had just got them, there is no way they would be liquidated to crash the market, what the thief I presume would do is sell as much as the market could bare without crashing the price and as much as he/she dared put through coin mixing services without having to high a profile.

1) all the coins seem to rise and fall mostly in sync with Bitcoin so this does not seem like a good strategy.
2) It seems like such a poor way to do those manipulations though, how is such a weak effect ever going to feed through to price?  The major way to manipulate price is to hack the network or be one of the big players, or release some misinformation that gets wide media coverage.
3) I think some people like conflict, so to take the opposing view on a bitcoin subreddit gets you that.

No I am not comparing apples to wizards. They are both stores of value and they are both are investments. Both of them trade on exchanges, they have many similarities.
It is behaving like a growth stock. The value comes from the belief that it will take a certain percentage of all commercial transactions not from the revenue it generates, that is how people get to the 10k valuations and above for bitcoin.

Steam was not the first, neither was Minecraft.

Currently bitcoin does not support microtransactions, if another coin supports this well that is a large advantage.
@_date: 2014-03-28 10:02:31
The fuckwits are the ones that think the number of blockchain transactions directly correlates with the amount of commerce that is occurring with bitcoin. Now that we have that out of our system, how about we have a civilised debate?
Lets say (just for the sake of an example) that the use of bitcoin gambling sites has been growing rapidly and now 90% of the transactions are generated from sites such as SatoshiDice, that would then invalidate using the raw transaction number as a sign of Bitcoins popularity.
@_date: 2014-03-10 12:51:38
Well the difference with bitcoin is that its not returning interest to owners, so I don't think it can be classed as a ponzi scheme any more than gold.

Perhaps the people that used to tip in bitcoins now tip in dogecoin. 
Perhaps they tip in dogecoin because it is easier to acquire by just doing a bit of mining, rather than having to buy some bitcoins from somewhere.
This theory could be tested by going through users who have tipped in bitcoin before and seeing whether they now tip in dogecoin.
Actually if you are really curious you could just pm some users who used to tip and no longer do, and ask them why.
@_date: 2014-03-28 09:58:14
Once you exclude fluff transactions, then I don't believe it is. Remove miner transactions, remove the gambling transactions, remove the duplicated transactions for commercial transactions (e.g. bitpay I presume has at least two transactions, one for the buyer sending over bitcoins and one for selling on the exchange). Remove splitting operations, remove transactions generated by coin washing services.

1) Given all the thefts and issues surrounding this is it not fair to assume that most coin holders would only keep them bare minimum required at an exchange and the rest in their own wallet.
2) Logic from point one follows on this one, who holds all their funds with a third party? Those figures suggest that many people are doing this. 
To register with coinbase are you required to provide id? If not then it could just be a much smaller subset of users with multiple wallets.

You could look at it either way, given how few people are actually using bitcoin and it has such massive traction already.

I am not, you are just failing to understand, don't blame me for your inadequacy.

Makes sense, also important to I would say is just don't do more than 5%-10% of your investment portfolio.

Well I believe you can use the wayback machine to see articles which have been delete from wikipedia.
 So that seems a bit redundant? If your fear is of it being lost I guess that a torrent could be set up for it.
But I believe that part of the reason wikipedia is so popular is that they do curate it, and unfortunately that means removing certain articles, to keep up "quality".
In 10 years time will BTC-E be at all notable? Other than as a footnote in Bitcoin's history I think not (given how short exchange lifespan seems to be.)

How can something which has a value of $0 store wealth?
@_date: 2014-03-20 15:40:43
I feel that you should have at least $100 in there, if bitcoin does go to the moon you are really going to be kicking yourself.
Actually if it does better be sure not to tell anyone it is in there otherwise it will go walkies.

So what does that mean for demand of bitcoins from China?

But the currency property is the one that is supporting the current price, or do you believe it is another property?

Please let it be sandcoins, please let it be sandcoins.
Seriously though bitcoin has two things over other cryptos its catchy name and being first. I think being first is overrated, time and time again the first mover gets buried by the next mover who just does it better.

@_date: 2014-04-10 17:30:19
I disagree, it seems that there were still people who believed that China banning was just rumour,  if that is the case then a full ban was not priced in. 
@_date: 2014-04-10 17:12:01
That what he is saying but if you think that looking into bitcoins price history is going to give you much insight on its own your going to have a bad time. 
@_date: 2014-04-10 14:49:38
I think the China thing still has a ways to go, it is still not 100% clear how much they want to clamp down on Bitcoin, so I believe that is not priced in yet.
@_date: 2014-03-24 12:31:18
Not necessarily, if the changes need to get there by consensus. Look at poor Symbian for an example of how consensus failed.

It is actually good news! 
@_date: 2014-04-10 20:55:32
Any sort of justification for that though?:)
@_date: 2014-03-10 12:36:07
I actually think it is an interesting concept, and every day brings something new.
However that does not preclude bitcoin failing, because another better designed alt coin comes along, or that at the moment putting your money in bitcoin is equivalent of investing in a penny stock, it could go to the moon or it could go into the ground, and really no one knows which.
@_date: 2014-03-19 07:38:23
One would be enough for this sort of transaction.

Ah sorry I thought it was something inherent to the bitcoin protocol. 
We should have significant life extension soon though, so yours logic does not really apply. Also I believe you just pass on the private key to your kids.
@_date: 2014-04-12 09:42:24
I was starting to get worried for a second there with all the downvotes that I had got it wrong, because if difficulty did not adjust downwards then bitcoin would keel over when the price tanks.
If the price goes back down to $1  (for the sake of argument) then absolutely the miners will have to shut down quite rapidly, because they still need to pay their electricity bills. 
If the price stays low for a sustained period, then the miners who have higher electricity costs will have to shut down.
@_date: 2014-03-22 10:48:46
Not really, you are assuming that total fertility rate stays constant, which it is not, it has been declining almost every year for a long time now. Some countries even have a fertility rate of 1.1 which means that their population will actually half in one generation.
If you plot the rate TFR is falling then at some point it would intersect with suicide + accident. Suicide rates (people deciding to no longer take treatment) would also probably be much higher. 
Its odd that one the one hand you seem very against life extension, but on the other you assume that everyone is going to want it.
@_date: 2014-04-10 17:03:50
Sorry but there is still enough murkiness about China and how complete the ban will be that it is not yet priced in.

I would not generate on my current windows machine either.
I install various applications on my mobile, so I can't say for certain whether it does or does not have malware on it, I think you over estimate how rigorous Google tests are for malware. On the plus side they do have Google play so they can pull malware apps once they appear.
I think I would rather go with an isolated machine and a linux distro.

The currency function at least gives an idea of what a fair value would be for bitcoin. These other properties are entirely unknown, so how can you assign them any sort of value?

I think you have lost sight of fundamentals.
Think of it like a growth stock, its value can skyrocket but at some point the revenue has to come in, or a sign that the revenue will come in. In the case of bitcoin this is that people want bitcoin so that they can do commerce. Otherwise it is just a bunch of people handing tulips to each other.
If you believe that this is something truly fundamental and new, then perhaps you should take a trip back in history and see what they were saying about internet stocks before it popped, similar sorts of reasoning you have given.
If bitcoin fails as a currency then it fails, the value it provides is as a currency.

Does the $200 include the use of gold as jewellery? I believe that the demand for gold from India for example significantly moves the market.
@_date: 2014-03-21 15:56:48
Gold is used as an input to manufacturing and people covet it as it looks pretty. It has uses. If it had no uses then its scarcity would not matter and its price would be $0.
Scarcity on its own does not mean that something will be a store of wealth, it only provides one of the important ingredients.
I could create another crypto today and call it sandalarcoin, it would be scarce as Bitcoin but its value would be $0.
Bitcoin gets its high valuation from the idea that it will replace a significant portion of world trade as a currency.
@_date: 2014-03-09 16:38:37
Makes sense really people that actually need to use bitcoin find out about it.

If there is a strong enough incentive then people will collude, but I don't know what measures are in place with opentransactions to stop voting blocks forming. If you look at mining for example though quickly it seems that large blocks have formed which have on multiple occasions almost breach the 51%.
Also look at the whole libor fixing rate fiasco, for an example of where having a strong enough incentive causes collusion between many parties given a strong enough monetary incentive.

While someone cannot take it. if you have 100+ bitcoins it puts a target on you for a malware attack.

Is this because the multi-sig requires that one of the sigs come from the bitcoin owner? If not then can the counterparties not collude and use their keys together to take your coins?
