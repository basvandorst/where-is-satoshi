Thanks, although I have no idea how that bot works, especially since I'm setting up my wallet tomarrow and thus haven't linked it with the bot (guessing that's how it's done) but thanks bro, hope your daughter keeps you young!

As a american I think $20 should cover almost any meal.
Hell $20 covers weed, that's better than any amount of food. Until your high.
@_date: 2014-03-07 15:04:46
Still $20 US will buy a nice burger fries drink a small nug, depends on where you go, I vote cookout.

That part at the end made me lol, thanks!
Also Jesus Christ I knew food in America was cheep, but cookout isn't a Mc'Donald's, yeah maybe you could do like, "tip  UK" or something, I'm not too good with the syntax of tip bot, but you get the point.

Damn, I you must live up north, I live in SC so everything is less expensive here.
Cookout (I usually get 2 burgers fries a drink and a warp which is a lot, I have a fast tummy) is like 15 bucks, 5 for a bug if you really want to (OG Kush only though :( ) and you can just chill around for the rest of the day.
20 bucks is like heaven bro. That will cover a nice lunch/dinner for me.

I think I'll use blockchain for my Wallet, and buy them off of someone local.
Thanks for all the help sir, wish I could tip you! :P Maybe if our paths cross later.

Does this apply to all firehouse subs?
I live in SC, and was wondering if I could pick up a sandwhich lol.

DAMN! I missed my time to buy! FUCK! Guys Bitcoin is going to crash and Mt. Gox stole all the bitcoins, they are useless I WILL BUY 1 BITCOIN FOR $20 USD! GREAT PRICE SELL NOW!

Thanks this is probably the most helpful comment in my thread!
But what kind of wallet should I use? I have no clue where to even begin on this one, my old wallets are "Out Of Sync" and I would rather start anew.

Thanks, MSG me on reddit or email me anytime, it's the least I can do for the help that you have provided.
Thanks for the Tip also, it might be the only thing in my wallet for a while, the last SC meet that I saw was like a few weeks ago. Hopefully I can find a seller on creigslist like you said.

Im not trying to get USD back out of bitcoin, Im saying once more people and more merchants jump on the BTC train, my little that I put in now will be worth more in pure value later.

Wasn't this already a thing?
Just not registered (it means they are beyter ) guns?
@_date: 2013-11-20 00:17:32
They arent a thing. Its currency, you use it to buy things and unless you want to invest in them, buy something with them or just be able to say you have them, they don't matter.
I cant afford a entire coin if i tried buy you can buy parts of one down to like 10c bro.
