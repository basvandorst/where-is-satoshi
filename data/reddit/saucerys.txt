Raising the blocksize doesnt improve scaling it merely increases throughput. At the cost of decentralization. Segwit is enough of a can kick that the block increase isnt urgent, and most devs support a scheduled non knee jerk hard fork later down the line (higher than 2mb). Andresen is contributing nothing of value at this point.

I think commodities are near the lows tbh. They've already been decimated alot, and rate rises will finally force some of these mining and energy companies to go under - reducing supply.
I agree on the AUD falling for a variety of factors.

Not to mention the job losses from auto, construction, and obviously mining. Not so lucky country.

I'm massively long bitcoin but I disagree with this. In a debt crisis, which will be triggered by this oil collapse, people scramble to the most liquid asset they can find to pay their debts and find safe havens. That is still the USD. The USD will temporarily skyrocket, then the safe havens such as Gold and 'safe' stocks will soon skyrocket after. Who knows with Bitcoin, it seems like a safe haven (properties of gold/outside banking system) but at the same time is a speculative new technology.

Lightning Network means that 27c fee could represent 200+ transactions.
Core devs do think a hard fork will be needed but only after segwit (due to utxo bloat/sig hash scaling fixes). However theres no consensus on what amount of blocksize growth will be necessary in the future
@_date: 2017-02-09 04:40:42
Hard fork means you can change things that are a core part of the protocol, like the block size, 10 min block interval, or even the amount of bitcoins created. This is not necessarily a good or bad thing.
The idea that hard forks are safer or simpler than soft forks is a myth (reasons shown in the middle of the infographic).

OMG CENTRALIZATION
@_date: 2016-01-17 15:23:57
Segwit will allow future soft forks to solve the problems caused by large blocks (relaying/hashing blocks and further mining centralisation) so that the blocksize can be raised safely AFTERWARD. It will also give us the short term effective blocksize increase that people are raging about.
The fact that theymos is censoring stuff is not a technical argument for raising blocksize before large block problems are solved.
The fact that the community is stamping around like impatient children is not a technical argument for raising the blocksize but an appeal to (ignorant) majority.
The fact that the lightning network isn't here (and may not be for a few years) does not mean it will never be here nor that it won't effectively allow endlessly scalable microtransactions.

A shared protocol and ledger will get the banks all speaking the same language which reduce their costs and allow them to talk more easily with each other.

I actually think the reason is simple. It requires more effort to upgrade to segwit than other proposals, and there's enough uncertainty that they're waiting for other miners to upgrade before bothering.
Some of their stances from Nov 2016 can be found [here]( Some pools like f2pool will take until next spring to actually upgrade. Meanwhile if Antpool is maintaining their stance no matter what then there's no point for other pools to take the effort.

The WSJ reported Monday that Goldman Sachs Group Inc. dropped out of R3 when it let its membership lapse and declined to invest equity. Banco Santander SA also recently dropped out, Reuters reported.
Bank of America Corp., Barclays PLC and UBS Group AG, also early members of R3, said they are still part of the consortium, though they did not comment on whether they plan to take an equity stake. State Street Corp. is “an active participant in discussions around the future of the R3 consortium. We are evaluating a variety of models,” a spokeswoman said. J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co. and Bank of New York Mellon Corp. declined to comment.
R3 has approached 42 banking members about investing in an equity funding round that seeks to raise $150 million over the next 9 to 12 months, a person familiar with R3′s plans said. An Ernst &amp; Young valuation during the summer placed R3’s worth at $150 million to $250 million, based in part on membership dues of $250,000 per year and expected revenues from commercial products, this person said. Companies may choose to buy an equity stake, renew memberships or walk away. Banks that choose not to participate in the funding round still may remain members of R3, helping develop blockchain technology and sharing research.
Financial institutions pushed R3 to raise money because they thought it would help the consortium meet its product development goals, the person said.
The prospect of investing further in R3 comes as banks stake their position in blockchain technology, which some say could make global banking faster, more efficient and more secure. Competing blockchain platforms have emerged. Santander and Goldman Sachs have invested in Digital Asset Holdings LLC, a startup that supports Hyperledger, an open-source blockchain platform.
In April, R3 unveiled a distributed ledger called Corda to manage financial contracts. It plans to open source the technology on Nov. 30, the person said. At that time, anyone will be able to download the code and build on it as long as it is not used for commercial purposes. The consortium plans to deliver at least one commercial product by the end of 2017, the person said. R3 is working on products for regulatory reporting, trade finance, payments, syndicated loans and know-your-customer verifications, among other areas.
If R3 succeeds in raising $150 million, participating banks would take a 60% ownership stake in R3 while eight founding executives would retain 40%. If R3 doesn’t reach $150 million in a first round, it plans to open the circle to members of its lab and research center. After that, technology firms and other investors would be able to participate, the person said.
Blockchain technology, best known for underpinning the system that trades the virtual currency bitcoin, has garnered attention from banks that see opportunities to save billions of dollars and make old-fashioned processes more efficient.
R3, founded in 2014, has said turnover in the group is expected. “Developing technology like this requires dedication and significant resources, and our diverse pool of members all have different capacities and capabilities which naturally change over time.”"

If we do hard fork, it should be a +X% increase in blocksize per year, or even a flat +X kb per year. With a ton of new optimizations to ensure small miners and nodes can handle it. A lot of devs think that's inevitable, but they will likely argue for years on what parameter to use because it's so difficult to predict the future. In any case, a single HF to 2MB only is a massive risk for not much gain.
At the end of the day, we don't know what will come out of this cauldron of tech in the future. It might be possible to scale without a hardfork ever, it might not. I mean, several years ago Segwit didn't even exist. Nor did Lightning.

The people in the know (i.e. developers) are tired of explaining it. They are also tired of 'negotiating' with people who just move the goalposts over and over. You should read [this thread]( to get the Dev opinions on it. Also, I posted this a few days ago:
"Because Core is divided on whether blocks are already too big for nodes. Segwit did not include a blocksize/weight increase initially, but some devs argued successfully that segwit soft fork was a safe way to raise it and segwit had enough fixes and optimizations that it didn't harm decentralization. So they compromised.
Some have an unnecesary obsession with hard forks. Hardforking to up the blocksize is just one way to scale out of many, and it is one that sacrifices security and decentralization. ALL alternate scaling methods that preserve decentralization should be preferred."
@_date: 2016-02-22 20:20:56
Segwit allows numerous upgrades to make a hard fork safer. It must be fully deployed first. Panic rushing into a hard fork is what's truly insane.

I agree that real estate is going down because it is mostly bought on leverage. Gold on the other hand will go up because (a) zero yield is better than negative yield (b) it has no counterparty risk in a world of very high credit risk (c) loss of faith in central bankers.
Everyone thought gold would tank when the Fed raised rates but the opposite happened. Deflation/Inflation isn't the only thing that matters to the gold price.

"Talk to any central banker about the future of currencies and they will agree that we are heading towards a world of electronic money.
Nobody is quite sure when it will happen or exactly what digital currencies will look like. But there is a growing realisation that the ideal solution will not involve a debit and credit in some ledger in cyberspace.
In other words, the utopian world of electronic currencies is unlikely to involve the technology behind Bitcoin, called Blockchain.
That brings us to the launch, or should that be relaunch, of digi.cash by an Australian company funded by Capital Markets Co-operative Research Centre.
This is an electronic currency in the truest sense of the term. The money is in the form of bytes of data which can be transferred electronically. Initially it is only available in Australian dollars.
The ownership of the currency is not determined by an account balance held in a ledger somewhere.
The technology behind digi.cash is an extension of the cryptographic protocols developed by American tech entrepreneur David Chaum in the 1980s.
Chaum launched the world's first crypto-currency in the 1990s but it failed miserably. Like so many tech inventions it was ahead of its time. In the 1990s when it hit the market, total e-commerce was estimated at about $1 million.
When his crypto-currency failed to gain traction, Chaum turned his attention to a range of other ground-breaking projects including an encrypted messaging system.
Twenty years later digi.cash has a new lease of life with the backing of a group of engineers and scientists in Sydney led by Andreas Furche. The backers include one of the co-leaders of the Australian team that invented Wi-Fi, Dave Skellern, and former Westpac Banking Corp executive Peter Clare.
It works this way: the electronic version of the currency is digitally minted as electronically signed coins and banknotes. These can be held on a smartphone, computers or storage devices.
The money can be transferred between online users. The encryption technology means that the electronic banknotes can circulate securely without the risk of theft or counterfeiting.
Furche says the cryptography allows the payer of a transaction to remain untraceable. The currency is created and transferred as 500 byte long RSA blind signature tokens, which allow the payer in a transaction to remain untraceable. RSA refers to the three men who invented the first global public key cryptography, Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir and Len Adleman.
Chaum extended the work done by Rivest, Shamir and Adleman with the addition of a blind signature protocol which is part of digi.cash.
The digital currency is operating under an exemption from the Reserve Bank of Australia which limits total funds on issue to $10 million."
