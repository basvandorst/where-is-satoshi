Exactly. Be aware that some exchanges also charge additional withdrawal fees on top of network fees (and some don’t)

every time you send btc from one wallet to another, there are fees. Sometimes exchanges will cover them for you, but you're definitely on your own with normal wallets

Analysis is bs, it’s not even real science. Applying patterns to things that don’t really follow patterns. The tech is what can change the world, and is what actually drives changes in price. Price movement in a vacuum is meaningless. It would have some credibility if you did real technical analysis, but you’re even doing the “real” fake science

Futures are a type of derivative. They are a mainstream way of trading on the change in value of something. They are important because they are a means for the regular financial market to put money into BTC. BTC futures also bolster the case for a bitcoin etf (which has been rejected before). All this is bringing money into BTC from the legacy financial world.

IMHO price conjecture is pretty irrelevant. Even the most experienced traders and analysts can’t predict prices reliably, so why should I trust you? Especially when your only argument for why bitcoin will reach 30k is because “it looks logical”.  Why not talk about the tech itself; developments that could help / hurt bitcoin and others, coins that could be useful in everyday life. Drawing lines on a graph doesn’t prove anything

I bought a cloud contract a while ago for .1 btc (when btc was about $1000) and it ended up paying for itself, but only because btc is worth so much more now. My total mining rewards since march are about .025 and the contract was for 2 years. So, I will make my btc back but very very slowly and will only have a small profit on top of that. Buying and hodling is much cheaper and easier. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 20:32:00
In situations like this I've heard of coinbase restricting accounts if you send btc to a known gambling or illegal address. Circle just doesn't want to look like a money laundering operation. Government and anonymity don't mix. You could probably make up some bullshit to please them, because I bet they only want something so that the government is happy

Keeping coins on coinbase is generally not advisable for significant amounts of money, because you are not in control of that wallets private keys. Coinbase could move your coins at will, or get hacked and lose your keys. Therefore keeping btc there requires a lot of unnecessary trust. To keep your coins more secure a normal desktop or phone wallet like electrum will do just fine. Unless you plan on investing your life savings into btc I wouldn't recommend spending the money on a hardware wallet.

Funny how they say this is going to be the "first mainstream adoption" when there's been crypto debit cards and atms around forever, not to mention crypto iras and etfs, along with companies like Microsoft and MasterCard working on blockchain tech, as well as whole countries making bitcoin legal tender. And to top that all off, burger kings whoppercoin. I'd hardly call whatever kiks doing a "first to be mainstream" attempt. Kik is a failing technology and I wouldn't bet on this helping them.

Notice that this is addressed in the article. It is pointing out some irregularity which gives more merit to the idea that it isn't just random occurrence.

Interesting point. However, there was still some weird animated visuals present on the site prior to that, similar to what can be found on [deos.org]( and the deos twitter. Regardless of the logo being there or not, the website definitely existed before the block, and had the same theme of visual animations before the block, which seems to strengthen the idea that Wilcox or some other was using the site for the same purpose before and after the block was produced.

you can sign up for a coinbase account. Technically youre supposed to be 18, but when you first sign up they don't really care. The only reason for them to start shutting down your account is if you start contacting them. Even if they do, there are forms you can fill out to obtain "consent" from your parents to use the site. You will, of course, need a credit card, checking account, or paypal.
