Damn! Cashed out 3 1/2 years too early...

It's a meme from /biz/. Ignore it.
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:24:21
This! 
I can't believe people doubt this.
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:18:54
Yes. It's posted in literally every major thread.

They wouldn’t go down in Sats if people weren’t blindly panicking. They would go down in USD value.
@_date: 2018-05-16 09:34:58
You are absolutely correct. Yet, my point still stands.
@_date: 2018-05-16 09:00:46
Could you please read my statement properly?


They only drop because everyone panics and tethers. If people were more chill and wouldn’t look after every move BTC does, Alts wouldn’t drop as hard as they do once BTC drops.
@_date: 2019-03-11 12:39:59
So you associate a failed project with a scam? Did you EVER check what a scam is?! EXACTLY this is the problem. Everything is a scam! No it’s not!
I’m not saying there weren’t a lot of scams under these 1000 projects! But a dead project isn’t necessarily a scam!
@_date: 2019-03-27 06:33:39
German bank transfers aren’t immediate either, they take a day. Sometimes even two, depending on when you made the transfer. And no transfer on weekends.
@_date: 2019-03-11 20:22:39
True, I agree with that.
@_date: 2019-03-22 14:26:41
Where he belongs. In the realm of forgottenness.
@_date: 2019-03-11 11:10:34
I will gladly believe you, if you show me proof for these numbers. If you can’t do that, then exactly THAT is the problem we have.
Something isn’t a scam just because you don’t understand it!! I don’t understand how the hadron collider worlds, but that doesn’t make it a scam. It just means I didn’t do enough research to understand it. 
Stop calling things you don’t understand a scam! If you understand it, then you’re safe to decide if it’s a scam or not. Other than that it’s just a totally unfunded and therefore useless opinion.
@_date: 2019-03-17 18:14:42
Still got fees. And that’s what it’s about here.
@_date: 2019-03-03 21:47:32
Yup, I’m from Germany and I drew this in elementary school in the late 90’s :)
@_date: 2019-03-24 11:06:55
Someone indicated it’s Faketoshi.
@_date: 2019-11-10 10:31:14
Well, he has outgoing transactions of a total 22 BTC end of 2013 and beginning of 2014. Let’s hope he didn’t sell back then...
@_date: 2019-03-11 08:22:36
People call everything they don’t understand a scam. The word scam is way too overused these days...
@_date: 2019-03-11 18:54:40
Dude, this is exactly the thing I’m talking about. All scams ARE intentional! If it’s not intentional, the result might be the same, but it’s not a scam by definition!
@_date: 2019-11-10 13:17:16
Wow! I didn’t know that! Thanks for the info! At least it’s useful.
@_date: 2018-10-18 12:25:40
Depends on your expectian what that amount would be worth in the future. In 2010 you wouldn’t have been too annoyed by losing 10 BTC, today that’s another story.
@_date: 2018-10-19 16:23:53
Are you kidding me?! It’s irrelevant what i think about BTC, but there are a lot of other projects, that WILL have its future and its usage. To say there’s no need to invest in anything other than BTC is, excuse my wording, just stupid.
@_date: 2019-08-13 22:13:20
 Co?
@_date: 2019-02-06 11:12:41
I’m not talking about that Shitcoin XRP here �������� 
@_date: 2019-02-15 23:16:07
So basically trading yes, payments no.
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:49:16
I doubt Bitcoin will still be relevant in 100 years. It will be replaced by some new tech. Maybe it's already around, but we don't know yet. The next 10 years will show it.
@_date: 2019-12-03 17:58:03
But they already MADE the revenue, so they still have to pay on the full 100m. Assume that the 100m in your example is amount Y and the 30m are amount X. You can’t just deduct amount X because you got hacked for amount X, and then pay taxes on amount Y-X. You will still have to pay taxes for amount Y! That’s not how taxation works!
Edit: There MIGHT be something like “lost collateral” or whatever to claim as a loss and reduce your tax burden, but you can be damn sure that there’s a limit on that and I’m sure it’s not high.

I’m not a native English speaker, so I didn’t know the exact terminology. But I meant exactly what you described. And no, you can’t do it that easily, that’s still not how it works.
@_date: 2019-04-16 13:11:26
That’s interesting! Thank you!
@_date: 2019-04-05 10:33:14
Good point.
@_date: 2019-04-16 09:58:10
I don’t know either. Care to explain pls?

1. Not gonna spoonfeed little minds
2. Not gonna let myself be accused of shilling.

If only REQ would be ready...
@_date: 2019-01-30 19:03:59
Thanks for the confirmation that you didn’t even do 10 minutes of research. It’s people like you who make this place so irrational.
@_date: 2019-01-22 00:12:44
And how will these smartcontracts get their offchain data? Oracles i guess? Sure. Centralized oracles to fetch data to a decentralized blockchain? Pointless. There is this one Alt, that will be needed by the majority of crypto projects. Bitcoin will definitely not make all Alts obsolete.
@_date: 2019-01-06 10:44:38


That’s not true. Do your research, find the legit projects.
@_date: 2019-01-22 10:20:03
Do you even understand the importance of decentralized oracles? Without that crypto doesn’t even make sense, at least when it comes to smart contracts. I’m not saying it will definitely become number 1, the market is still irrational. But it is without a doubt one of the most important projects in crypto. It went from  to  in a Bear market, uptrend over the last 7 months as the ONLY project in the market. That should tell you something. And Mainnet isn’t even there yet.

@_date: 2019-01-22 16:56:33
Okay, if that’s your opinion...
I was just giving mine and trying to show another perspective.
To conclude this here: Lightning will be the end of “some” Alts, not all.
@_date: 2019-01-22 00:06:04
Yeah right. I guess that’s why big businesses are interested in Smartcontracts and decentralized oracle solutions. Holy shit, this place is dumb...
@_date: 2019-01-29 14:15:58
Lol, maybe you should have a look out for a few decent projects. 
@_date: 2019-01-22 09:05:15
You clearly didn’t do enough research. There is one project that will do this and it’s close to completion. Do more research.
@_date: 2019-01-22 14:39:04
Oof, you might regret not researching it in a few years.
But yeah, I made it sound like I’m shilling, that wasn’t my intention actually. I’m just saying, just check it out, I can send you a link to a medium article if you are interested, everything you need to know is explained there. 
@_date: 2019-01-30 09:29:00


What a bullshit statement. Just because you don’t know of any with your (probably) 10 minutes research, doesn’t mean there aren’t any.
@_date: 2019-01-22 13:10:09
Except that the project I talk about didn’t do ANY marketing beside attending a few conferences and holding the same presentations there. No hype or marketing gags like TRX, EOS and whatever else there is.
I will just name it. Do yourself a favor and look up on Chainlink. Bc i think you lack some understanding here. Look it up and try to understand why it’s so important. 
Btw, Sergey Nazarov, CEO of Chainlink will have a Chat with Tom Gonser tomorrow. And if you don’t know who that is, you should look it up and think about why this is a big deal.
@_date: 2018-02-10 17:18:48
Don’t get me started on this one!
@_date: 2018-02-13 18:36:05
Oh, didn’t know that. Thanks!

Over The Counter, a trade that doesn’t take place on an exchange, but with a private seller or even the exchange itself without appearing in the books or affecting the price (except if the exchange has to buy the bitcoins itself rather than selling it from their cold storage).
