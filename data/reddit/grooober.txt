Blockchain does not necessary mean an "immutable ledger." It's just a data structure where new data is linked to the older data, that's it. Nobody says you can't have unlimited number of blockchains, or you can't chop it halfway, throw away the entire newer half and continue adding from the halfway point.
It's a nice term used in bitcoin and we know how that works. It's also "a word" used in articles. Bitcoin blockchain is one thing, and the trendy buzzword blockchain used by financial or journo non-tech types is a totally different thing.

Did someone calculate the efficiency? It's a lot of heat no doubt, but ratio of $ to BTU is probably pretty high. It's like saying I help by recycling a plastic bottle, when a factory in China spews out more pollutants in one day than the equivalent of me recycling all my bottles for my entire lifetime.

Gold is mined not at all just like bitcoin. You can't suddenly strike a rich vein that will give you 100 BTC per block. We also know how many bitcoins there will ever be, vs I dunno... maybe there's a layer of gold a mile thick somewhere where we hadn't found it yet.
Stealing an object is not the same as hacking it. Stealing doesn't change how gold was designed to operate, which is what hacking is.

Wow lots of smokers here upvoting this nonsense. These are not benefits. Calming nerves is what a hit of nicotine does to a person getting jittery as nicotine is leaving their body. This isn't an issue for non-smokers who don't have withdrawal symptoms in the first place.
There are better appetite suppressants, plus why use those anyway? If one has to suppress appetite there is a bigger problem with nutrition. Throwing in a nicotine addiction is not a solution at all.
People can be social without smoking. I smoked for 6 years and never liked cigars. Those are terrible.

* People want it because other people want it (kinda like bitcoin, heh).
* It doesn't rust. It's non-toxic. Stable (non-reactive).
* There is not enough of it to make it worthless. It cannot be easily manufactured (it can be just atoms at a time which is slow. For faster process go to your nearest star and explode it.)
* There's enough of it to make processing into jewelry and coins worthwhile. Equipment and skillz cost money.
* It doesn't harm human body when worn as jewelry. It is relatively well recognizable everywhere in the world.
* It is relatively easy to melt and remelt. It's ductile, can be manipulated into shapes.
* It has definite utility - jewelry, electronics, dentistry, bedazzling iphones of rich and famous. Some people like how it looks and like to play with it.
* Its value density is high. $100K in gold is 5.61lbs (2.79kilos), easy to hide or carry. Whereas 100K in silver will be 429.85lbs, you need something on wheels to carry that much.

While it's easy to move crypto around, it's not so easy to move fiat. The friction of transferring fiat to/from exchanges and trading between USD and RMB is the reason for price difference. If money could be moved freely the arbitragers would close the price gaps.

You could take a cheap USB miner and throw it at almost the speed of light. As time will slow down relative to the USB miner, it might take 100 years for it to find a block, but relative to us it will still seem like only 10 minutes. You don't need much computing power, but your energy needs to push a physical object that fast will be close to infinite.

If 1% of bitcoiners thought they could strike it big and would play satoshidice, and then 1% of people who knew about bitcoin would have the money and decide to buy satoshidice, then Eric W would get lots of bitcoins, lots of players would not have won anything, and one sad buyer would own a POS site satoshidice. Then... I forgot where I was goin with this.

You asked literally "what can gold do that bitcoin cannot?" Your other phrase "bitcoin to become new gold" is nonsense, like chickens becoming new trees. I had some fun with the answer; it wasn't meant to be an in-depth examination of the features and capabilities.

Don't say silly things. Brute force attacks have a 100% success rate, given enough time. The limits of currently available computing hardware and the associated time trade off to find the keys is what makes encryption work today.

I've often thought about how much productivity "following the bitcoin" kills. Many many people are just sitting there watching the charts, browsing reddit, and trading just a few BTC up and down. They are either getting very low per-hour returns (pennies), wasting their irreplaceable time while barely breaking even, or most likely wasting their time AND losing money.
@_date: 2015-10-30 01:35:50

The hashrate is known. Available hardware specs are known. You can make some assumptions like 2/3 of hashrate is at lower efficiency GH per KW (older hardware), and 1/3 is at best available efficiency. Then make similar estimates for electricity costs. 2/3 probably mines at 8 cents per KWh and 1/3 mines at 4 cents per KWh. Also throw in initial investment for that hardware, add rents for the floor space. Then make maths happen to determine the total initial cost plus ongoing power costs.

It is quite horrible in all regards. One of the harder habits I broke and very happy to have done so. Yes people find enjoyment in it, as they do in heroin and meth. I'm not arguing that nicotine and hard drugs are on the same level of badness; they aren't. Only that their perceived benefits are similar: a hit of drug is a hit of drug - it changes mental and physical state.

It's just another exchange. Any reasonable trader would wait months to maybe a year before moving their coins to a new exchange. It could be hacked or suffer glitches, or take your money hostage. Nobody wants to beta test this thing with their own money. Make volume posts maybe 6 month from now.
