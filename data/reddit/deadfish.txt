This is a terribly written article with a shaky understanding of bitcoin and bitcoin markets.

Just checking you out for the first time now. Any reason why your rates are so much higher than other exchanges?

It's just highlighting on the pdf that you can delete in acrobat or even preview on a mac. Pretty stealth...

Do you currently offer margin and shorts? If not, do you plan to in the future?

Let's start from the bottom and work our way up.
 - How would this work? The bill is just the company saying how much you owe. There's no assurance there. And, some sort of external entity that interfaces with company software that checks bill vs request amount?
 - Payment address sounds just like a wallet. What's the difference. Set up a different wallet for each company? 
 - Goes without saying.
I think the more likely answer would be a service in between that is trusted like we currently trust credit card companies and banks that would have access to your wallet. You could then set up specific companies/individuals that could request money and automatically be paid. That's basically a credit card though. 
Or maybe a direct interface where you can set up some sort of limited access to your wallet for direct deposit? Like, say the person with this key can access up to $100 per month and no more. That might be interesting actually.

Gas is cheap because the Venezuelan government subsidizes it. It would be cheap regardless of the value of their currency.

Or daytrade and make bundles of money while selling :) 
Yesterday was very profitable for some of us. Buy and hold is for suckers.
